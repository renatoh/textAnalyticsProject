Damian Green has been forced to resign as first secretary of state after admitting he lied about the presence of pornographic images on his House of Commons computer. Read the full story from the Guardian\u2019s Heath Stewart: The timeline of the saga: The who\u2019s who: The politics: Away from the Green pornography scandal, there was the small matter of the EU withdrawal bill, which moved to report stage. That\u2019s all from me tonight. Have a peaceful evening. The editor of the FT, Lionel Barber: More front pages on the news that Damian Green has been sacked as first secretary of state after admitting he lied about the presence of pornographic images on his House of Commons computer. The government has survived a series of amendments, and the bill moves to the report stage. It will be back in parliament on 16 January 2018. The front pages of national newspapers have started to appear. All of them lead with the Green sacking. Theresa May knew she was going to fire Green during the liaison committee meeting earlier, according to the Sun\u2019s political editor Tom Newton Dunn. As the Damian Green drama develops, the chamber continues to vote on the EU withdrawal bill. The government amendment which fixes the UK\u2019s EU exit date as 11pm on 29 March 2019, unless ministers decide to change it, has passed. The government also defeated a motion to keep the UK in the EU\u2019s customs union and a Labour amendment which would have prevented ministers using delegated powers to create criminal offences that carry custodial sentences. Kate Maltby\u2019s parents, Colin and Victoria Maltby, have released a statement following Green\u2019s sacking. Maltby accused the former minister of sexual harassment last month. We are pleased that the Cabinet Office has concluded its enquiry into the conduct of Damian Green. We are not surprised to find that the inquiry found Mr Green to have been untruthful as a minister, not that they found our daughter to be a plausible witness. We have received many supportive messages from people near and far who appreciate Kate\u2019s courage and the importance of speaking out about the abuse of authority. We join with them in admiring her fortitude and serenity throughout the length of the investigation and despite the attempted campaign in certain seconds of the media to denigrate and intimidate her and other witnesses. We are proud of her. We have ourselves known of these incidents since they first occured and have fully supported Kate in the responsible manner in which she has reported them. The Sun\u2019s political editor Tom Newton Dunn says there will be no immediate reshuffle in the cabinet. Here is a timeline of the investigation into the Damian Green pornography scandal: Accompanied by a who\u2019s who: More reaction from political commentators to Green\u2019s sacking: According to the Daily Mail\u2019s deputy political editor John Stevens, David Davis will not resign in protest as he had previously threatened. Robert Peston on Green\u2019s resignation: Conservative MP Damian Green has resigned as first secretary of state amid allegations that pornographic material was found on his Commons computer in 2008. More to follow. More from the chamber: Tory MP Ken Clarke has just called on the government to say in the EU\u2019s single market in the chamber. It is said we have to leave the single market because it\u2019s accompanied by freedom of movement of workers. Well, as we were running the most generous version of that in western Europe before the referendum, I think if that\u2019s your problem - if that\u2019s migration is what you\u2019re really getting out of - let\u2019s address that and not throw out the baby with the bathwater and leave the single market and similarly the customs union. I hope we won\u2019t have the extraordinary spectacle of fear of right wing Eurosceptics going to such lengths that the government\u2019s putting a three-line whip on its ministers and all its backbenchers to cast a vote against the Florence speech so that some room is left for them to be able to negotiate further with either the environment minister or the foreign secretary or whoever it is wants to reopen it again. The debate is getting a little heated in parliament. Moments ago in the House of Commons, pro-Brexit MP Kate Hoey was mocked by her Labour colleagues. MPs are expected to vote on a series of amendments to the EU withdrawal bill at around 9pm. Votes on staying in the customs union and a second referendum are on the cards. A side note: Ed Miliband might have won the prize for the best Christmas card in UK politics for 2017. It\u2019s rather fantastic. MPs are reacting to Theresa May\u2019s evidence to the liaison committee. Alison McGovern MP, a leading supporter of anti-Brexit campaign group Open Britain, said: The Prime Minister seems desperate to pretend that her humiliating defeat in the Commons over Amendment 7 didn\u2019t happen. The language of the amendment was crystal clear: Parliament must be given a real, meaningful vote on the terms of Brexit. That means by statute, not just a rubber-stamp of whatever the Government manages to negotiate. It is not acceptable for the Prime Minister to try and ignore the democratically expressed will of our elected MPs. That would be an affront to our sovereign Parliament and the opposite of \u2018taking back control\u2019. Tom Brake, Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesperson, said: With all her muddling and obfuscation it is quite clear that Theresa May is trying to worm her way out of a meaningful vote in Parliament on the Brexit deal. But the hard reality for Theresa May is that Parliament will not be denied a say and she will be held to account for her handling of negotiations. Her failure to provide clear answers when questioned reveals just how much of a mess this government have got themselves in. There\u2019s a simple solution to all of this, give the people a say on the final deal and an exit from Brexit. Brexit minister Steven Baker is answering questions from MPs on the EU withdrawal bill in the House of Commons. He confirmed there would be an amendment to the bill at a later stage so MPs would have to approve a change in the exit day. Christmas cheer ensued. Former minister George Freeman said: It feels to me at this Christmas moment that not since the soldiers met on the fields of no man\u2019s land singing Silent Night has peace broken out at such an opportune moment. Here are the main points from Theresa May\u2019s evidence to the liaison committee. May refused to confirm that MPs would vote on the EU withdrawal agreement and implementation bill before the withdrawal agreement gets ratified. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs committee, repeatedly pressed May on this point, but May refused to confirm that the Commons vote on the bill would come before ratification. (See 4.04pm.) May claimed it would be possible to complete a free trade agreement with the EU before March 2019. She accepted that it would only be possible to sign a trade agreement after Brexit, but she insisted it could be negotiated before then. EU leaders think it will take much longer, but May did not accept this. She said: The reason I\u2019m confident that we can do this within the time concerned is because we start off from a different point. So we haven\u2019t got a situation where country A is coming to negotiate with the EU not having had any arrangements with the EU before. We come form the point where we\u2019re actually a member of the European Union, we\u2019re operating on the same basis at the moment, and therefore I think that starts us off from a different position in terms of our negotiations on trade in the future. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, suggested she was not being realistic. \u201cI\u2019ve met nobody who think it will be possible to negotiate all of the details of that [trade deal] by March 2019,\u201d he told her. Benn said his committee was about to publish \u201cmost\u201d of the 850-page compilation of secret Brexit \u201cimpact reports\u201d produced by the government. Ministers only released them to the committee after a vote in the Commons, and MPs have only been allowed to read in strict conditions intended to stop them being leaked. The Commons demanded Brexit impact reports, but David Davis, the Brexit secretary, had to admit that the documents being handed over were not full impact assessments because such impact assessments did not exist. Benn told May that members of the public would soon be able to read them. He said: We are about to publish most of what you have given to us, and I think the public will see that there is no assessment of the impact of Brexit on the different sectors of the economy. May refused to say what goods would be covered by the \u201cfull alignment with EU rules\u201d proposal for the Irish border in the UK-EU deal agreed earlier this month. The \u201cfull alignment\u201d clause is in paragraph 49 of the document (pdf). Benn asked whether agricultural products, or other goods, would be covered by this provision. May refused to give a direct answer, saying this was just a fallback option and that the government expected to avoiding having to have a hard border in Ireland using one of the two alternative measures in paragraph 49. At one point she even said the \u201cfull alignment\u201d proposal was a \u201cdefault default\u201d position. She refused to accept that leaving the EU would mean increased trade barriers with either the EU, or the countries with which the EU has trade agreements. (See 3.43pm.) That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Patrick Greenfield is taking over now. This is what Damian Green, the first secretary of state, told the Lords EU committee earlier about how the government is moving closer to agreement with the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales on the EU withdrawal bill. He said he hoped they would not refuse the bill legislative consent. I am not just being hopeful. I have observed over the past three months the degree of of progress that we have made. It is clearly not in the interests of people in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland for there not to be a working statute book. Equally nor is it in any of their interests for there to be barriers to trade between the different parts of the UK. So in a sense we have a common interest - the UK government and all the devolved administrations - in making sure that we get to a satisfactory position here. There are obvious differences of emphasis but I genuinely think that we can come together in common agreement. When the UK government legislates over areas that are devolved, it is meant to get legislative consent from the Scottish parliament or the Welsh assembly. But the Scottish and Welsh governments have not agreed to give that consent yet because they are unhappy about the bill\u2019s devolution provisions. Wollaston ends by saying the committee is unhappy that the national security adviser, Mark Sedwill, is refusing to give evidence to the defence committee. May says the national security adviser has provided evidence to the committee in a joint session. He is an adviser to her and the national security committee, she says. She says ministers are accountable to parliament. Wollaston says there is precedent for the national security adviser giving evidence. She says the liaison committee feel \u201cvery strongly\u201d that he should appear. May says the defence secretary is willing to give evidence. She will write to the committee about this. Wollaston says the committee is not happy about this. May repeats the point about ministers, not civil servants, being accountable to parliament. Officials do appear before committees. But the relevant committee for the national security adviser is the joint committee on national security strategy. She says she will respond in writing. And that\u2019s it. Summary coming soon ... Maria Miller, the Conservative chair of the women and equalities committee, says more than half the women in the country suffer sexual harassment in silence. What can government do? May says there are things government can do, but it is not just a government issue. She says she does not think there is a single \u201csilver bullet\u201d that will address the problem. Q: Should it be a crime to offer money to employees to silence them? People are astonished at the use of non-disclosure agreements in these cases. May says agreements that try to silence whistleblowers are not enforceable. There are confidentiality agreements used to settle disputes. But they should go no further than protecting privacy. There are conditions that apply. She says she is happy to look at the issues around this. This is from the Press Association\u2019s Richard Woodhouse. Wollaston echoes Field\u2019s point. She says May should see committees as there to help get legislation over the line, particularly in a hung parliament. May says it is not the case that the government is only focused on Brexit. Labour\u2019s Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, goes next. Q: For some time now governments have boosted the incomes of pensions, and cut the incomes of working-age people. Is it time to redress that? May says the government is spending \u00a390bn a year on working age benefits. Q: You commissioned the Taylor review to look at part-time work. How serious are you about legislating for this. Rachel Reeves and I could draw up a bill for you with our committees. May says the government will respond to the Taylor review shortly. She would not have commissioned the report if she did not intend to act. Field says Brexit is taking up so much of May\u2019s time. Other people are there to help. That is why he is offering to draw up a bill with Rachel Reeves. May says women are good at multi-tasking. Robert Halfon, the Conservative education committee chair, goes next. Q: Why not rebook the social mobility commission, put it in Downing Street, and get it to check all government policy boosts social mobility. At the moment it is just a thinktank. May says she wants to use the opportunity provided by Alan Milburn\u2019s departure to refresh it. But she insists the government is already following a social mobility agenda. She cites her racial disparities audit as an example. Labour\u2019s Clive Betts, who chairs the communities committee, is asking questions now. Q: There is a shortfall in social care funding, but no money to pay for it. May says extra money has been put into the system. Q: As if Age UK say 1m people are not getting the care they need, it is all the councils fault, is it? May says she recognises there are problems. But councils are getting access to \u00a39bn extra funding over three years. Q: Do you accept funding has reduced in real terms since 2010, but demand has gone up? May says more than half of councils increased spending in real terms last year. And some councils have shown they can expand funding and provision. Q: So you are saying there is no funding problem? May says she recognises there are are pressures on social care, and extra money has gone in. This is from Barney Pell Scholes, policy and press officer at Open Britain, on May\u2019s exchanges with Cooper about the vote on the withdrawal agreement. That\u2019s it on Brexit, Wollaston says. She turns to social care. Q: Do you recognised that extra funding is needed for social care? May says she recognises there are pressures. She says the government has put extra money in. Q: Do you accept we need to take a longer view on health and social care funding? May says she has said before there should be three-pronged approach to social care funding: short-term, medium-term and long-term. Q: Should the social care review cover health too? May says there are overlaps, and they are recognised on the ground. Even ITV\u2019s Robert Peston is befuddled by the May/Cooper exchanges. (See 4.04pm.) Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative chair of the public administration committee, goes next. Q: How to you respond to Oliver Letwin\u2019s proposal that you need a very senior cabinet minister to take charge of Brexit planning across Whitehall? May says a structure is in place already. The Brexit department has an important role to play. This is from BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Spence. Cash urges May to be \u201cvery robust\u201d in her response to the EU negotiating guidelines issued today. (See 10.55am.) They read like an ultimatum, he says. May says these are the starting point of negotiations. The UK will be robust, she says. Sir Bill Cash, the Conservative chair of the European scrutiny committee, goes next. He asks a technical question about the status of retained EU law after Brexit. May tells Cash she will respond to his latter on this in full. Q: Now that Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendment has been passed, can you confirm there will be a vote on statute before a withdrawal agreement is ratified. May says there has to be an agreement before there can be a withdrawal agreement bill. Q: But will the vote on primary legislation take place before the treaty is ratified? May says there will be two votes - on a resolution, and on the bill. Q: But will MPs vote on the bill before ratification? May says parliament will have a vote. Q: But will parliament vote on a statute, rather than a motion, before ratification. The government has ignored motions. May says the government will look at amendment 7. But she wants parliament to have a meaningful vote. It is the bill that will ensure the agreement becomes law. Q: But will that be before ratification? May says it depends what bit of ratification you are talking about. Parliament cannot vote on an agreement before there is one, she says. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, goes next. Q: Do you want the UK to remain part of Eurapol and the European arrest warrant? May says Cooper knows, from their debates in the Commons in the past, that May thinks being a member of both benefits the UK. But these are matters to be negotiated, she says. She says it will depend what the EU offers. Cooper says it is disappointing May cannot say that staying in would be our best objective. Q: Can you confirm you will not use numberplate recognition cameras on the border in Northern Ireland? May says she has said there will be no cameras at the border. She says she will not give a running commentary on these matters. There will be no physical infrastructure at the border. Q: So there will be no cameras? May says there will be no infrastructure. She will not go into detail. Cooper says that reply is also \u201cbaffling\u201d. Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the foreign affairs committee, is asking questions now. He refers to a report out today saying the navy has no ships deployed overseas. May says the navy is engaged abroad. Andrew Murrison, the Conservative chair of the Northern Ireland affairs committee, goes next. He asks about the border. May repeats the point she made earlier to Hilary Benn. She says the \u201cfull alignment\u201d proposal is only a fallback. This is from the Independent\u2019s Rob Merrick. The Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn is also unimpressed. But the Independent\u2019s John Rentoul says at least we have seen May wearing glasses. My colleague Dan Roberts is also in despair. The SNP\u2019s Angus Brendan MacNeil, chair of the international trade committee, goes next. Q: After Brexit, how many countries will the UK have increased trade deals with? May says the UK wants new trade deals. And it will want trade deals with the countries that have trade deals with the EU. MacNeil says the UK will have increased trade barriers with up to 94 countries. May says she does not accept the premise of that question. It implies the UK will not have a trade deal with the EU. She says the UK intends to have new trade deals, including with countries where the EU does not have trade deals. Q: Do you accept the UK could have increased trade barriers with up to 94 countries. May says MacNeil is assuming the UK won\u2019t be able to negotiate trade deals. One possibility is for the UK to roll over the trade deals with third countries the EU already has. Talks have already started on that. Q: Do you have any views on political prisoners in Spain? May says the government supports the idea that the rule of law should be applied in Spain. Q: Will the UK stay in some EU agencies? May says the UK has contributed to the expertise of the European aviation safety agency. It wants to maintain that high level of expertise. On Euratom, she says the UK will leave the institution - but continue to work in line with its standards. Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves, chair of the business committee, goes next. Q: What does regulatory alignment mean to you? May says in some areas regulations have no bearing on trade. In other areas the UK will want to have the same aims as the EU, achieved by different regulations. And in other areas it will want the same regulations. Q: Businesses are worried about the UK diverging from EU regulations, because that will make trade harder. May says businesses want to be able to carry on trading as they can now. Agreements will be reached on the conditions that will apply to people\u2019s trade. This is from my colleague Peter Walker. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative chair of the Treasury committee (who was sacked by May as education secretary), goes next. May says the UK will not be paying the \u00a339bn to the EU over the long term. Q: Michel Barnier says the City will not be included in a free trade deal. May says Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, addressed this earlier. He says the City was a banker for the whole of the EU. She says she expects there will be more recognition of this as the talks go on. Q: The EU does not think you will be able to negotiate a trade deal before March 2019. They think all you will get is a scoping agreement. Why do you think you will be able to agree the deal before then? May says there are different views as to how long a trade deal will take. She thinks it can be done differently because the EU and the UK start off with the same rules. Q: Were you aware that no Brexit impact assessments were carried out? May says she knew government departments were in touch with different sectors. Benn says his committee is about to publish \u201cmost\u201d of the 850 pages of Brexit reports the government gave it. People will see that they do not assess the impact of Brexit. Brexit select committee to publish \u201cmost\u201d of government\u2019s secret Brexit reports shortly, Hilary Benn says. Q: Do you think you can negotiate a trade deal before December 2020, the deadline the EU wants for a transition? May says that is what she is working to, and \u201cthat is what I believe we can do\u201d. Q: So does that mean you cannot say that the \u201cfull alignment\u201d fallback would cover agriculture? If you cannot say that, what does it mean? May says what she is saying is that there will be no hard border. The government has put forward ideas as to how that would be done. Q: But if some goods are excluded, they would be subject to checks. And so the commitment not to have checks would not apply. It is a simply question. May says she has a simple answer; there will be no hard border. May refuses to specify what goods might be covered by the \u201cfull alignment\u201d proposals for Northern Ireland in the UK-EU deal on phase one of Brexit. May is giving evidence now. They start with Brexit, with Hilary Benn, chair of the Brexit committee, asking the questions. May says the government hopes it will be able to solve the Irish border issue by means of a free trade agreement. Q: If you have to rely on the \u201cfull alignment\u201d fallback, would that cover agriculture? May says she does not want people to assume that is what the government is aiming for. As for what it does about agribusiness, that is a matter to be negotiated. She says she is \u201csure\u201d the government will be able to achieve the first of its three options for addressing the border issue - the trade deal. Theresa May is giving evidence to the Commons liaison committee. The liaison committee comprises the chairs of all the Commons select committees and it started holding regular sessions with the prime minister when Tony Blair was in office. With sessions lasting 90 minutes more, they amount to about the most extensive public scrutiny to which a PM gets exposed. TV and radio interviews now almost never last more than half an hour. And although the prime minister takes questions in the Commons for up to two hours or more when they make a statement, MPs only get one question, with no follow-ups, which makes life easier. At a select committee an MP can interrogate a witness at length. Which means in theory these should be quite revealing exchanges. In practice, that is not always the case. Prime ministers end to be quite good at dodging difficult questions and most members of the committee are not as tenacious or awkward as Andrew Tyrie, the Tory MP who chaired it in the last parliament and who was probably the outstanding select committee chair of modern times. The Tory MP Sarah Wollaston now chairs the committee. Ahead of today\u2019s hearing she said: These hearings will examine important areas of domestic policy. Given that this session follows such a significant EU council meeting and recent events in Parliament, on this occasion will start with a focus on Brexit negotiations and transitionary arrangements. The committee will also be asking about sustainable long term funding for health and social care and explore progress since the prime minister\u2019s pledge on the steps of Downing Street to fight burning injustices. Whilst making sure that Parliament gets its own house in order when it comes to tackling sexual harassment, we must not lose sight of the impact of this in many different workplaces and we plan to raise this with the prime minister to ask about her plans. Responding to the UK government\u2019s announcement about giving consumers access to superfast broadband (see 9.43am), the SNP says the Scottish government\u2019s offer is much better. This is from the SNP MP Drew Hendry. The Tories ambitions for broadband delivery are deeply disappointing and their ambitions are far behind those of the Scottish government. The \u2018on demand\u2019 proposition sounds like a cop-out and it is clear that families, business and communities in Scotland will be much better served. Meanwhile, the regulator Ofcom\u2019s latest report has again confirmed that Scotland is currently rolling out superfast broadband at a faster rate than the rest of the UK. The Tories\u2019 poor offer come just days after the SNP government announced a \u00a3600m investment to bring superfast broadband to every single home and business in Scotland \u2013 the largest ever public sector investment by any government in the UK with the vast majority of the funding coming direct from the Scottish government, dwarfing the commitment of the UK government. The Scottish government has committed to extending superfast access to all of Scotland by 2021 \u2013 with speeds of at least 30Mbps \u2013 and committed \u00a3600m to delivering that; the UK government has decided that just 10Mbps is sufficient for the rest of the UK. Green says he hopes the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly will give legislative assent to the EU withdrawal bill. Progress has been made on the issues that concern them, he says. He says it is not in their interests for the UK not to have a functioning statute book after Brexit. Back in the Lords committee Damian Green says the government is now considering how to best involved the devolved administrations in the trade negotiations with the EU. He wants to ensure \u201cthe whole of the UK is contribution to our negotiating process\u201d, he says. MI5 has recorded a surge in the number of \u201chigh risk\u201d terror suspects, as security services confront the unprecedented threat facing Britain, it has emerged. As the Press Association reports, a parliamentary report has disclosed that the agency is devoting an increasing share of its activity to monitoring individuals who have received terrorist training or are plotting attacks, a parliamentary report disclosed. It also flagged up serious concerns about extremists driven out of Iraq and Syria and laid bare the extent of Islamic State\u2019s murderous ambitions, with an arm of the group said to be plotting terrorism in the West \u201cpretty much all day every day\u201d. The disclosures are contained in the intelligence and security committee\u2019s annual report for 2016-17 (pdf). In a statement Dominic Grieve, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said: The scale of the terrorist threat facing the UK is unprecedented in terms of the number of current investigations and the overall number of \u2018individuals of interest\u2019. MI5 have told us that it represents a pace which they have not experienced before. Q: Could the different nations of the UK have different relations with the EU after Brexit? Green says it was a UK-wide referendum. The government respects the results of both the EU referendum and the Scottish independence referendum, which involved Scotland deciding to stay in the UK. He says it is negotiating with the EU as the UK. Q: But attitudes to immigration vary geographically. Could different places have different immigration policies? Green says it is hard to see how that could happen without a border. But he says the migration advisory committee is carrying out a review of immigration policy. The devolved administrations have put in lengthy submissions, he says. Q: How far further advanced are we as a result of this week\u2019s cabinet meetings? Green says the key reason for an advance was the agreement reached last week. But the cabinet has discussed the transition and the end state. Damian Green, the first secretary of state, has just started giving evidence to the Lords EU committee. He is talking about Brexit and the devolved administrations, which is one of his responsibilities. You can watch the hearing here. I will be monitoring it until the Theresa May committee hearing starts at 3.15pm. More opposition politicians have joined a legal action to establish whether the UK can unilaterally stop the Brexit process if British voters decide the final deal is unacceptable. The group now includes MPs, MEPs and MSPs from all four parties in Scotland, excluding the Conservatives. The first four signatories were Alyn Smith MEP from the SNP; Ross Greer MSP and Andy Wightman MSP from the Scottish Greens; and David Martin, a Scottish Labour MEP. Christine Jardine, a Liberal Democrat MP for Edinburgh West, has now joined the group, along with the second of Labour\u2019s two Scottish MEPs, Catherine Stihler, adding to the divisions within Labour over Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policy that the leave vote should be honoured. The seven politicians, drawn now from the Scottish, UK and European parliaments, want the European court of justice (ECJ) to rule on whether the UK can halt the article 50 process without needing the approval of all other 27 EU member states. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, told the Guardian this week that any decision to abandon Brexit needed an agreement from all 27 but the petitioners say that position has never been tested by the courts. In a significant boost to the petitioners\u2019 case, which was submitted to the Scotland\u2019s civil court, the court of session in Edinburgh, on Wednesday, one of the EU\u2019s most senior legal experts argued the UK could withdraw article 50 without the consent of other member states. \u201cArt 50 is based on the principle that withdrawing from the EU is a unilateral decision. Nobody can force a state to leave,\u201d Jean-Claude Piris, former head of the EU council\u2019s legal service, wrote on Twitter on Thursday. \u201cThe only condition is that [the] decision is taken in conformity with its constitutional requirements.\u201d And here are some more lines from my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll from the Michael Gove select committee hearing. Environment secretary Michael Gove has suggested Britain would block a post-Brexit trade deal with the US if it included the sale of chlorine-washed chickens, currently banned by the EU. While he ducked the question of whether he would veto a trade deal in order to protect consumers, he said Britain would not waiver on animal welfare standards built up by the EU over decades. He has also expressed concern about antibiotics used in livestock and bee-harming pesticides, neonicotinoids, used on grain that goes into breakfast cereals and other consumer foods. This may set up on a collision course with Wilbur Ross, the US commerce secretary who last month said changing EU regulations will form a \u201ccritical component of any trade discussion\u201d. \u201cThe cabinet is agreed that there should be no compromise on high animal welfare and environmental standards,\u201d Gove told the environment select committee on Wednesday. In America they cannot guarantee the same high standards in terms of how chickens are reared that we insist on here. He repeatedly ducked attempts by the committee\u2019s chairman, Tory MP Neil Parish, if he would \u201cveto\u201d of \u201chold a whole trade deal up\u201d if the Americans insisted that the UK accept its lower standards as part of a future trade deal. The UK sees Michel Barnier\u2019s statement that a Brexit transition deal should end on 31 December 2020 (see 11.57am) as a \u201cnegotiating position\u201d, which could be changed, Downing Street has said. Asked about the comment from the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, May\u2019s spokesman said a transition deal should be in place \u201cjust as long as is needed to get the arrangements in place\u201d, and this was likely to be \u201caround two years\u201d. He said: The commission is setting out their negotiating position. Those negotiations will get underway shortly. We are currently looking at around two years, 24 months. The commission have said just over 21 months, but it\u2019s a negotiation. Theresa May is to challenge her Polish counterpart, Mateusz Morawiecki, over his government\u2019s controversial interference in the country\u2019s judicial system during talks in Warsaw tomorrow, Downing Street has said. May is travelling to Poland on Thursday, a day after the European commission began a process which could see the country stripped of its EU voting rights over plans by Morawiecki\u2019s rightwing government which Brussels fears could undermine judicial independence. May\u2019s spokesman said: We place importance on respect for the rule of law and we expect all our partners to abide by international norms and standards. The prime minister will raise her concerns with the prime minister when they meet tomorrow. We hope that Poland the the commission can resolve this through discussion. Asked if May\u2019s trip was an effective endorsement for Morawiecki, who took over earlier this month, the spokesman said: We have a strong bilateral relationship with Poland, and we have shared interests going forward, in areas such as security in particular. They\u2019re an important partner and we look forwards to continuing to work with them. This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs. Some are calling it for May, but others are generally unimpressed by either leader. From the New Statesman\u2019s George Eaton From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope From the Spectator\u2019s Isabel Hardman From PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield From the Independent\u2019s Andrew Grice and Tom Peck From the Evening Standard\u2019s Kate Proctor From the Guardian\u2019s Peter Walker From Politico Europe\u2019s Tom McTague From the i\u2019s Nigel Morris The i\u2019s Nigel Morris says PMQs, which is supposed to last just half an hour, went on for a record 53 minutes. As usual, the questions from Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, got missed earlier because I was posting the snap verdict. So here the are. Blackford asked if the government was right to intervene in the departure of the boss of RBS. May said decisions were taken in the past. If Blackford was raising RBS branch closures, he would get the same answer as last week, she said. Blackford replied: It\u2019s supposed to be PMQs, the prime minister is supposed to at least try and answer the question. If it was right in 2013 to intervene in the departure of the CEO then it\u2019s of course quite right that the government takes its responsibility when the last 13 branches in town are going to be closed in Scotland. Prime minister - show some leadership, stand up for our communities, bring Ross McEwan into Downing St and tell him you\u2019re going to stand up for the national interest and stop these closures. May says branch closures were a matter for banks. She went on: I have to say to him that\u2019s a bit rich coming from an SNP which in government in Scotland is going to increase taxes for 1.2m Scots. The Conservative government is reducing tax for 2.4m Scots. There\u2019s only one clear message to people in Scotland. Conservatives back you, the SNP tax you. I\u2019ve taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. Andrew Selous, a Conservative, says he is glad May is taking personal charge of housebuilding. How will that happen at the scale and the speed necessary? May says 217,000 new homes were built last year. That is the highest level for the last 30 years, excepting one other year. John Baron, a Conservative, asks May to confirm that, if the power to delay Brexit under the Oliver Letwin amendment were used, it would only be for two months at most. May says the UK is going to leave on 29 March 2019. But she wants the UK government to have the same powers to extend article 50 as the EU has. So if this power were used, it would only be for the shortest period of time, she says. Julian Lewis, a Conservative, asks May to confirm that the Oliver Letwin amendment to the EU withdrawal bill, allowing the government to change the Brexit date, would only be used in exceptional circumstances. May confirms that. The government would only use this power in exceptional circumstances for the shortest possible time. May confirms that in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d the government would be willing to delay Brexit for a short period of time. May says 1.2m Scots earning more than \u00a326,000 will pay more tax under the Scottish government\u2019s plans to raise taxes. She says she accepts the claim that the Scottish government could raise the money by efficiency savings. Labour\u2019s Bill Esterson says the way RBS treated small businesses ruined lives. Will May set up an independent inquiry? May says the government is looking into this. She recognises Esterson\u2019s concerns. Chris Green, a Conservative, asks May to consider a new funding plan for refuges. May says the government wants to put the funding of refuges in the hands of local authorities, with oversight. The Conservative Geoffrey Clifton-Brown asks about the City and Brexit, and Michel Barnier\u2019s comments. May says Barnier has made a number of comments. The government is sure it wants the City to maintain its position as a global centre of excellence. We value the important role that the City of London plays, not just as a financial centre for Europe but actually a financial centre for the world. We want to retain that and maintain that. Monsieur Barnier has made a number of comments recently about the opening negotiating position from the European Union. The Bank of England and the Treasury have been setting out today reassurance to ensure that banks will be able to continue to operate and will be able to continue to ensure that the City of London retains its global position. But this will be of course part of the negotiations on phase two of Brexit. We are very clear on how important this is. Labour\u2019s Stephen McCabe says 1m youngsters will lose free school meals because of universal credit. May says more children will get access to free school meals under the government\u2019s plans. Labour\u2019s Lucy Powell asks if May agrees with the criticisms of the government\u2019s social mobility action plan made by her former chief of staff, Nick Timothy, in his Sun column this week. May says the Sutton Trust have praised the plan. It is a good plan, she says. The SNP\u2019s Drew Hendry asks May if she agrees that is not fair to force terminally ill people to meet work coaches if they are claiming benefit. May says the government has to deal with those cases with utmost sensitivity. She says conditions for people who are terminally ill who are claiming benefit have remained the same under successive benefits. People must be treated with sensitivity. Suella Fernandes, a Conservatives, asks about a local college in her constituency. May congratulates the college. May says Labour thinks education is just about money. But what parents care about is the quality of the education provided, she says. PMQs - Snap verdict: May left Tory MPs shouting \u201cmore, more, more\u201d, and it was certainly one of her most confident performances in recent weeks, but it wasn\u2019t a particularly illuminating exchange, or even a very decisive one, and we end the year where PMQs concludes much of the time, with what\u2019s broadly a stalemate. Corbyn did not have any particularly memorable moments, but his questions were solid and robust, and his performance probably ended up in the \u201cjob done\u201d category. Arguments about the NHS at PMQs often just become statistic-slinging sessions, and that\u2019s what this felt like. Most of the figures (including the obligatory reference to Wales), sounded familiar, although May did have a new claim about the number of people now apparently alive who would not have been under previous cancer survival rates. It was moderately interesting, but did not clinch the argument. May, though, did beat Corbyn and in the quote swapping challenge towards the end (her Corbyn quote trumped his quote from a Tory council leader) and May\u2019s final soundbite did what was required in the circumstances. Corbyn says the Welsh government relies on a grant from London that has been cut. He asked about GPs. But there are 1,000 fewer GPs now than when May became prime minister. Many old people have unmet care needs. Does May regret not putting more money into social care in the budget. May says the government put \u00a32bn more into care in the spring budget. Corbyn raised Labour\u2019s record on health. Its legacy was described as a mess, she says. Who described it as a mess? It was Corbyn himself, she says. When is is running for leader, he denounces Labour\u2019s record. Now he is leader, he tries to defend it. Corbyn quotes someone saying the NHs needs to tackle chronic underfunding in the NHS. Who said that? The Tory leader of Warwickshire country council. The NHS into the winter in crisis, he says. Staff numbers are falling. Budgets have been cut. The PM has shown just how out of touch she is. The NHS has been recklesslessly put at risk by her government. May says Corbyn is wrong because NHS funding has gone up and care funding has gone up. Not that long ago Corbyn said he would be PM by Christmas. He was wrong. \u201cI am, and the Conservatives are in government.\u201d He predicted the government would not get beyond phase one of the Brexit negotiations. He was wrong about that too. And he said the budget would be a failure. He was wrong on that too. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Corbyn says patients are being kept waiting. If the NHS had the resources it needed, it would be meeting its targets. Can May promise those targets will be met in 2018? May says more money is going into the NHS. But is is not just extra money going into. It is about reforms too, she says. She says the NHS is delivering a world-class service. Corbyn says A&amp;E waiting targets have not been met for two and a half year. Cancer targets have not been met for two years. The government promised to recruit more doctors. Where are they? May says the government is recruiting more doctors. But let\u2019s look at what is happening in Wales. Targets for waiting were last met there in 2008. Who is in charge there? Labour, she says. Jeremy Corbyn also wishes MPs and Commons staff a happy Christmas. And NHS staff. Does the NHS have the resources it needs this winter? May also wishes happy Christmas to NHS staff, and to all emergency service staff. She says the NHS has prepared more for winter this year than before. She quotes words saying those measures will keep people safe. Those words are from the head of NHS providers, she says. Corbyn says 50,000 patients have been kept waiting on trolleys. He says the NHS England chief executive said the NHS needed an extra \u00a34bn. Again he asks if the NHS has the resources it needs. May says NHS funding is at record level. She says Corbyn comes to the Commons complaining about the NHS. But there are more diagnostic tests, more operations, and higher survival rates. She says there are 6,500 people alive now who would not be if cancer survival rates had not improved. In response to question from the Tory Paul Beresford on the green belt, May says councils can only alter green belt boundaries in exceptional circumstances. Labour\u2019s Rosena Allin-Khan says the number of families relying on food banks continues to rise. When will the government stop this? May says the government has lifted hundreds and thousands of children out of absolute poverty. She says Allin-Khan talked about 2,000 families in Wandsworth being homeless. That implies children are sleeping on the streets. This generates loud jeering. May says homelessness in this context does not mean sleeping on the streets. Statutory homelessness is lower now than for most of the time Labour were in power, she says. Theresa May starts by wishing all MPs a merry Christmas and a happy new year. And she offers Christmas greetings to members of the armed forces abroad. PMQs is about to start. Here are the main points from the Michel Barnier press conference and from the European commission negotiating guidelines released this morning. Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said the EU wanted the Brexit transition to end on 31 December 2020. He implied that the UK would still have to abide by EU fish quotas during the transition. Asked about this, he said: What we say for the transition period is that all community policies will continue to apply. Mrs May said in her Florence speech [policies would apply on current terms]. So that would of course apply to a very important community policy such as the common fisheries policy. But at the same time the UK has decided it will no longer be part of the [European] council. So when there are discussions, such as the discussions establishing the fish quotas, the lengthy night talks which take place, with the UK\u2019s departure, for that period after the UK has left they will no longer be part of [those talks]. We\u2019ll have to find a mechanism, a way of consulting with the UK specifically on this questions. He also said paragraph 20 of the guidelines covers this. It says: Specific procedural arrangements which are compliant with paragraphs 17 and 18 should also be found for the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities (total allowable catches) during the transition period. He said the UK would not automatically be covered by EU free trade agreements during the transition. It would have to negotiate extensions to ensure they continue to apply. He said: Legally speaking, the day after the UK has left the EU institutions, the UK will no longer be covered by our international agreements. They will be leaving approximately 750 agreements which we have signed as the European Union which cover today the UK. So 30 March 2019 they will no longer be covered by the bilateral agreements that the EU has concluded with third countries. We\u2019ve got the Ceta [the Canada free trade agreement], for instance. And there the UK needs to prepare as of now to be able to replicate those agreements. What that means as well is that they have to ensure that already now they have the administrative capacity to carry out those negotiations, to conclude those agreements. He also included a political point about how this showed that Brussels \u201cred tape\u201d has its advantages for member states. (See 11.15am.) That seemed aimed at Tory Brexiters. He implied that Spain would have a veto over transition agreements relating to Gibraltar. In theory the EU will agree the withdrawal agreement by qualified majority voting. But Barnier said he wanted to proceed by consent. This is from my colleague Jennifer Rankin. He repeated his assertion that the EU does not have any free trade deals giving privileged access to financial services. He said people should not underestimate the \u201cdifficulty\u201d of getting European parliaments to ratify the final trade deal. Here is the press notice the European commission has issued alongside its new negotiating guidelines. And here is an extract with the main points. The draft negotiating directives, which supplement the negotiating directives from May 2017, set out additional details on possible transitional arrangements. These include, in particular, the following: There should be no \u201ccherry picking\u201d: The United Kingdom will continue to participate in the customs union and the single market (with all four freedoms). The union acquis should continue to apply in full to and in the United Kingdom as if it were a member state. Any changes made to the acquis during this time should automatically apply to the United Kingdom. All existing union regulatory, budgetary, supervisory, judiciary and enforcement instruments and structures will apply, including the competence of the court of justice of the European Union. The United Kingdom will be a third country as of 30 March 2019. As a result, it will no longer be represented in union institutions, agencies, bodies and offices. The transition period needs to be clearly defined and precisely limited in time. The commission recommends that it should not last beyond 31 December 2020. The recommendation also recalls the need to translate into legal terms the results of the first phase of the negotiations, as outlined in the commission\u2019s communication and joint report. It underlines that work needs to be completed on all withdrawal issues, including those not yet addressed in the first phase, such as the overall governance of the withdrawal agreement and substantive issues such as goods placed on the market before the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. Labour MPs are being told by the leadership not to support an amendment tabled by Nottingham East MP Chris Leslie, which he says would allow the UK to keep open the option of remaining in the customs union. A briefing note sent to Labour MPs ahead of today\u2019s debate on the EU withdrawal bill and seen by the Guardian says: \u201cThis amendment would not keep the UK in a customs union with the EU\u201d. It says it is \u201cnot possible\u201d to \u201cunilaterally\u201d remain in the customs union - or create a new customs union. It goes on: This can only ever be party of negotiations. Labour will not therefore be supporting this amendment but do recognise the importance of ensuring our final negotiated relationship with the EU retains the benefits of the customs union. Leslie and his backers, who include a well-organised caucus of senior MPs, including Chuka Umunna and Heidi Alexander, are keen to maintain pressure on Labour\u2019s frontbench to adopt a clearer position on continued customs union and single market membership. The text of new clause 13 says ministers cannot appoint an exit day from the EU, without first making \u201cprovisions that shall allow the UK to remain a member of the EU common customs tariff and common commercial policy\u201d, to replace the relevant bits of EU law. Q: Will the UK be covered by the common fisheries policy during the transition? Barnier says the document out today says all EU policies will apply during the transition. The CFP is an important policy. But the UK will not be part of EU discussions. So it will not be party to discussions on fishing quotas. He says a mechanism will have to be found to ensure the UK is consulted. Barnier suggests EU fishing quotas will still apply to UK during transition. Q: What will happen if the UK parliament rejects the deal? Barnier says he does not like to speculate. But he says it is important to build trust. That is why he is taking time talking to political groups in the European parliament. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: Will the UK still benefit from EU free trade agreements during the transition? And will you have to update those agreements accordingly? Barnier says that is a very serious question, and a complicated one. Legally speaking, the day after the UK leaves the EU, it will not be covered by these agreements. It will be leaving around 750 EU agreements. It will not be covered by agreements like Ceta, the Canada free trade agreement. The UK needs to start work now to make sure they replicate those agreements, he says. He says when people talk about Brussels red tape, they forget this red tape works in the interests of member states. The UK will not have these agreements, so it will need to negotiate its own red tape. Barnier says UK will not automatically be covered by the EU\u2019s 750-odd external agreements during the transition. It will have to replicate them, he says. Will the UK be able to negotiate free trade agreements during the transition? Barnier says the UK will have to respect the EU rules. But it will be understandable that it will want to have \u201cexploratory talks\u201d with other parties about trade deals. Barnier says he cannot say what form the political declaration covering trade, as part of the withdrawal agreement, will be. But he wants it to be precise, so everyone knows where they are going, he says. He says time is going to be of the essence. Between October 2018 and the end of 2020, there will not be much time. He says he would like that political declaration to be constructed in line with European council guidelines, so that it can facilitate the legal drafting of the treaty or treaties. He says some of the provisions will be in a mixed treaty, meaning they will have to be ratified by national parliaments. He says he is going around EU nation states meeting governments and parliaments, so that he can guarantee success. He urges people not to underestimate the \u201cdifficulty\u201d of this process. Q: Norway sometimes takes part in EU technical talks. Do you imagine this happening with the UK during the transition? Barnier says he is familiar with the way the EU works. He regularly attends meetings with EEA members. But he says the UK has said it wants to leave the EU institutions. That is there choice. During that short period there will be dialogue, he says. The EU will have to consider what dialogue there will be during the transition, and beyond. Referring to \u201ccomitology\u201d (yes - it\u2019s a real EU word), Barnier says when it comes to the committee structure, in some cases it will be in our mutual interest to work with the Brits. Q: Paragraph 24 on Gibraltar is in the section on the future relationship. Do you expect Spain to agree a transition covering Gibraltar. Barnier says he has already covered this. He wants the agreement on transition to be made by consensus, with all 27 agreeing. Q: You say the trade deal will not cover financial services. But when you were financial services commissioner, you backed the TTIP deal that included financial services. Barnier says the EU does not have any trade deal allowing automatic access to financial services. He says the EU did envisage, with its US deal, some cooperation with the US on financial services. He will not return to the outcome of that. But there is no free trade agreement between the EU and other countries giving privileged access to financial services. Barnier is now taking questions. Q: Should the transition apply to Gibraltar in the same way as the rest of the UK? Barnier says the transition is part of the withdrawal agreement. He says the EU negotiating guidelines from April covered Gibraltar. There has to be consensus and unity among the 27, he says. The EU will maintain that unity, he says. There is a better feed of the Barnier press conference here. On this one, you can have it in English. The European commission has issued two documents with its latest Brexit negotiating guidelines; they are here (pdf) and here (pdf). I will summarise them soon. Barnier says the duration of the transition should be short and specific. The European commission wants the transition to end on 31 December 2020. That is also the end of the EU\u2019s multiannual financial framework (its longterm budget). Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is giving a press conference now. There is a feed here. He is speaking about the proposals being released today for the Brexit transition. The UK would keep all the benefits of the single market, but also all EU laws, he says. The European commission wants the Brexit transition to end on 31 December 2020, Bloomberg reports. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has just started giving evidence to the Commons environment committee. You can watch the hearing here. Neil Parish, the Conservative chairman of the committee, starts by asking what the impact of Brexit on food prices will be. Gove says it depends what happens. He says if the UK were to end up without a trade deal with the EU, and if it kept tariffs as they are now, prices would go up. He says the UK could choose to get rid of tariffs. But that would have an impact on farmers, he says. Gove says tariffs are not the only issue. He says he thinks there will be increasing opportunities through technology. The Commons Brexit committee is taking evidence from three academics and specialists this morning: Professor Michael Dougan, professor of European Law and Jean Monnet Chair in EU Law, University of Liverpool; Professor Anand Menon, director of UK in a Changing Europe; and Stephen Booth, director of policy and research at Open Europe. Business Insider\u2019s Adam Payne has some highlights. The International Monetary Fund has welcomed progress on Brexit talks but warned the timeframe is ambitious because of the long list of tasks to address, my colleague Angela Monaghan reports on the business live blog. She has more here. The White House has said that it expects to announce details of President Trump\u2019s visit to the UK \u201csoon\u201d. Asked whether the possibility of a visit to the UK was discussed when Trump spoke to Theresa May yesterday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told a Washington press conference: That invitation has been extended and accepted. And we\u2019re working with them to finalise the details, which we expect to announce soon. And we\u2019ll keep you guys posted on that once that\u2019s finalised. Trump is expected to come to London in February to open the new US embassy in south London. The government has confirmed this morning that it will go ahead with plans to give consumers a legal right to high speed broadband by 2020. As the BBC reports, it has rejected a proposal from BT for the legal obligation to be dropped in return for BT instead adopting a voluntary approach to high speed broadband rollout. In a press notice the department for digital, culture, media and sport said: The government has confirmed that universal high speed broadband will be delivered by a regulatory universal service obligation (USO), giving everyone in the UK access to speeds of at least 10 Mbps by 2020. This is the speed that Ofcom, the independent regulator, says is needed to meet the requirements of an average family. After careful consideration the government has decided that regulation is the best way of making sure everyone in the UK can get a decent broadband connection of at least 10 Mbps as soon as possible. Following the creation of new powers when the government passed the Digital Economy Act 2017, we launched our consultation on the design of the regulatory USO in the summer. The government will now set out the design for a legal right to high speed broadband in secondary legislation early next year, alongside our detailed response to the consultation. Ofcom\u2019s implementation is expected to take two years from when we lay secondary legislation, meeting the government\u2019s commitment of giving everyone access to high speed broadband by 2020. In the summer, we received a proposal from BT to deliver universal broadband through a voluntary agreement. We welcomed BT\u2019s proposal and have considered this in detail alongside a regulatory approach. We did not feel the proposal was strong enough for us to take the regulatory USO off the table, and have therefore decided not to pursue BT\u2019s proposal in favour of providing a legal right to broadband. The House of Commons is sitting tomorrow before it adjourns for Christmas, but there is not much on the agenda for Thursday and today is the last day with a full parliamentary agenda. We\u2019ve got the last PMQs of 2017. Providing (hopefully) a less theatrical but more illuminating means of holding her to account, we\u2019ve also got May giving evidence to the Commons liaison committee about Brexit and other matters in the afternoon. And we\u2019ve got the last day of the EU withdrawal bill\u2019s committee stage debate. Ministers were worried the bill would get mauled in committee. The government lost a significant vote last week, but it has won all 35 other votes. At the start of the committee stage it took the surprise decision to table an amendment to the bill fixing 29 March 2019 as the date for Brexit. There was no especial need for this amendment (critics claimed that it was just a ploy to win some positive headlines in the rightwing press, and to mollify Tory Brexiters unhappy at the compromises being made at the same time over the Brexit \u201cdivorce bill\u201d), and it soon became clear the move was a mistake, because a significant number of Tories were planning to vote against on the grounds that it would reduce the government\u2019s room for manoeuvre if the Brexit talks overran. The amendment is due to be put to a vote today, and until Friday it looked like another defeat was looming. But then Sir Oliver Letwin, the former Cabinet Office minister and a government loyalist, tabled another amendment offering the government an escape route. It will keep 29 March 2019 in the bill as Brexit day, but allow MPs to change it if the negotiation doesn\u2019t finish on time. All sides seem happy with the compromise, even though it does render the original government amendment rather pointless. The government has still not officially announced that it is accepting the Letwin amendment, but sources indicate that it will be accepted today and Letwin told the Daily Telegraph: As far as I can make out all will be well. All the indications I\u2019m getting are that the government is likely to accept it. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: The IMF presents its annual report on the British economy. My colleague Angela Monaghan will be covering it on the business live blog. 10.30am: Michael Gove, the environment secretary, gives evidence to the Commons environment committee about trade in food. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. Around 1pm: MPs begin day eight of the EU withdrawal bill\u2019s committee stage debate. There will be votes at around 5pm and then further votes after 9pm. 1.15pm: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee. 2.10pm: Damian Green, the first secretary of state, gives evidence to the Lords EU committee about Brexit and the devolved administrations. 3.15pm: May gives evidence to the Commons liaison committee.
