Barkley will go into Sunday\u2019s reunion with Everton, from whom he moved for a cut-price \u00a315m in January, restored to the national squad and having impressed under Sarri in the Premier League. The 24-year-old recently scored in three consecutive top-flight matches and, having feared he might play second fiddle to Mateo Kovacic, a loanee from Real Madrid, has become a regular. His current standing contrasts markedly with Sarri\u2019s early assessment of his abilities. \u201cAt the beginning he was in trouble,\u201d the Italian said. \u201cThen he started to improve in every training, in every match. And so I am surprised [at his ability to adapt] if I think back to the first month, but not if I think of the last two months. \u201cI like very much him because I think he is a complete player. He has physical qualities. He is fast. Technically he\u2019s very good: he has a good kick with the left foot, and with the right. He\u2019s improving in moving the ball. He\u2019s quicker, mentally quicker, and he\u2019s improving tactically. I think he\u2019s on the way to becoming a very important midfielder, not only in England. Barkley, I think at the moment from a tactical point of view, is a step ahead of [Ruben] Loftus-Cheek. Loftus-Cheek arrived later because, in the first part of the season, he had two or three little injuries.\u201d Barkley played 179 games for Everton, through whose youth academy he had graduated, before indicating his desire to leave last year. Chelsea had been willing to pay closer to \u00a330m for him in the summer of 2017 only for the player, out with a serious hamstring injury, to have reservations. \u201cI achieved my dream of playing for Everton,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cIn my living room I always used to tell my mum: \u2018One day I\u2019ll score for Everton\u2019, and when that happened it was unbelievable for me. I tried to achieve success there but sometimes these things happen in football. Coming to Chelsea was a big challenge. I was approaching 25 [sic] and I felt, looking back, I could have improved a lot more [at Everton]. At Chelsea I knew I\u2019d improve a lot quicker around better players, world-class players.\u201d In the Women\u2019s Champions League, Chelsea have drawn Paris Saint-Germain in the quarter-finals. The winners will face the holders, Lyon, or Wolfsburg, last season\u2019s runners-up, in the last four."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
