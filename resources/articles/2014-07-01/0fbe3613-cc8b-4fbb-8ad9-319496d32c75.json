Her F\u00fcnf Lieder (1910), in late romantic style, expressive and full of darting chromaticisms, show her at her best. Karen Cargill, warm, instinctive and golden-voiced, and Simon Lepper are responsive partners here and in Mahler's R\u00fcckert-Lieder and Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen. With Linn's usual high standards of recording and programme notes, this disc gives intimate insight into an endlessly fascinating couple."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
