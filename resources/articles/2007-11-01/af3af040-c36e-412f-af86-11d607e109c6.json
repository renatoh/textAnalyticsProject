Road transport is responsible for around 22% of total UK emissions, and the numbers of cars and freight carriers on the road are rising, according to transport statistics recently released by the Department for Transport (DfT). This week Ruth Kelly, the transport secretary, outlined plans for a more sustainable UK transport system. Kelly's report promised to help persuade the public to use more public transport. Yet actual investment in public transport infrastructure was lower on the list of priorities than promises to expand the size of airports. The government also announced plans to invest \u00a313 billion into the widening of motorways up until 2010. The car-versus-environment debate comes down to two burning issues: how to reduce congestion on the roads and how to make less polluting cars. On the first point, the Department for Transport announced in its sustainability report that it would consider a highly unpopular road-pricing scheme on a local level, claiming it \"has the potential to cut congestion by nearly half\". Jason Torrance, of the Campaign for Better Transport, argues that the road pricing scheme has worked wonders in London, where the congestion charge has reduced both congestion and pollution, but warns this was only because the scheme was \"dealt with in a joined-up way\", and included massive investment in local public transport. A local transport bill is expected to enter parliament in mid-November, aiming to devolve powers over local transport to the regions. But the ideal solution to combating congestion, according to Torrance, would be a national, rather than local, road-pricing scheme directly linked to investment in the national public transport infrastructure. The government's rail transport white paper, released in July this year, suggested it had \"paid the bills in the difficult years\" after rail privatisation, sparking fears that government spending on the rail network may be reduced. The government has announced ambitious plans to \"enable the railway by 2030 to deliver twice the passengers of today in more comfort\" but current progress towards that goal looks slow. Freight and shipping Demand from businesses and shipping companies for more efficient and reliable freight transport networks has led to a recent boost in government funding for rail freight, which on average emits three times less CO2 than modern trucks. Car manufacturers are putting resources into the research and development of greener technologies in cars. These include biofuels and hydrogen fuel cells. But to date only a minority has launched groundbreaking designs, such as the Toyota Prius hybrid car. In 2000 the EU set a voluntary CO2 emissions target for car manufacturers at an average of 140g of CO2 per km for 2008. Nearing the end of 2007, the average new car in the UK still produces 165g/km. The European parliament has just voted to set a mandatory target for car manufacturers at 125g/km by 2015, not including emissions cuts using biofuels. Tony Bosworth, senior transport campaigner at Friends of the Earth, argues that the 2020 target \"should be set at around 80g CO2 per km \u2014 half the current average emissions\" \u2014 if Europe is to achieve the kind of CO2 reductions recommended by Sir Nicholas Stern. The climate bill, the UK government's follow-up to the Stern report, due out mid-November, is expected to aim for at least a 60% reduction on emissions, but with no plans to project sector-specific carbon budgets, expectations from the transport sector to help meet that target are still unclear. Aviation Airlines, especially those of the short haul, budget variety, have been in the spotlight since the release of the Stern report. One of the fastest growing sources of carbon emissions in the UK, international and domestic aviation was, according to government figures from 2005, responsible for 6.3% of UK emissions, with the industry expected to almost double in size by 2020. Despite these worrying growth statistics, little has been done. The UK government plans to leave international aviation out of the emissions targets in this year's climate bill. In the meantime, the DfT is relying on the inclusion of aviation in the European Union emissions trading scheme (ETS) from 2011 to address aviation emissions. A DfT spokesperson explains that under the EU ETS \"any increases in carbon emissions from flights departing or arriving at EU airports must be offset by reductions elsewhere in the economy.\" Meanwhile the UK plans to expand the capacity of its international airports such as Heathrow. There are serious doubts over the ability of the ETS to curb airline emissions. According to the UK climate change research body, the Tyndall Centre, EU aviation emissions could have already grown by 25%\u201360% between 2005 and when the full ETS comes into operation in 2012. The Tyndall report also predicted that the small rise in price of air travel under the ETS would do little to deter people from flying. The environmental research group Trucost has produced an efficiency ranking of large publicly listed airlines, revealing that budget airlines Ryanair and EasyJet are among the least polluting airlines, while Italian carrier Alitalia and British Airways are the worst performers. In comparison, Eurostar maintains that its train journeys to Paris and Brussels from London are 10 times less polluting than flying. The DfT has been criticised by environmental groups for its lack of action on climate change. Greenpeace executive director John Sauven argues that any of the carbon savings suggested by the DfT's sustainable transport report would be \"wiped out many times over by flights from British airports\" under aviation expansion plans. He asks: \"Even France's President Sarkozy has ruled out aviation expansion, so why can't our government?\" Putting together coherent policies on climate change may be a tall order for the Department for Transport, whose current stance is to support lower transport emissions where the market conditions allow it to. Growth in aviation and car ownership in the UK are the main drivers behind the contradictions in the DfT's environmental strategy. While it may be easier to coax commuters out of traffic jams and on to trains and buses, persuading people not to fly ill remain, as Leo Murray from the anti-aviation group Plane Stupid puts it, an extremely hard sell\". \u00b7 Zara Maung is editor of ClimateChangeCorp.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
