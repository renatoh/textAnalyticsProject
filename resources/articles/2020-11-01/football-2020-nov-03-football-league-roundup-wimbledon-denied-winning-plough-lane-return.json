The Dons striker Joe Pigott had the distinction of scoring the first goal at the new stadium after 17 minutes, smashing a low drive home from 10 yards out. Doncaster equalised when Wimbledon failed to clear and Matthew Smith tucked away the loose ball. Pigott scored his second of the match in the 83rd minute but Doncaster equalised in added time through James Coppinger. Long-range goals from Jack Taylor and Dan Butler gave the pace-setters Peterborough a 2-0 win at Bristol Rovers. Three minutes before the break Taylor strode on to a pass from Siriki Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and fired into the roof of the net from 25 yards. Midway through the second half Butler found the top corner with a sweet left-foot shot from just outside the box. Charlton made it six straight wins as Ben Purrington and Conor Washington\u2019s double helped them to a 3-2 victory over Fleetwood, for whom Ched Evans scored twice to pull them level from 2-0 down. Grant Leadbitter scored his second late penalty of the season to secure three points for Sunderland in a 2-1 win over his former club Ipswich. Sullay Kaikai struck as Blackpool secured back-to-back wins with a 1-0 victory over struggling Wigan. John Akinde\u2019s second-half header earned Gillingham a 1-0 win at Crewe to end a run of five successive defeats and John Marquis scored twice as the away-day specialists Portsmouth earned a fifth successive win on the road with a 3-1 victory at Lincoln. In the Championship, Sheffield Wednesday beat Bournemouth 1-0 to end their four-match losing run and record a first home victory since February. Barry Bannan scored a second-half penalty to ease the pressure on the manager Garry Monk as both teams ended the match with 10 men. Steve Cook was sent off for the Cherries for the challenge that resulted in the penalty while Wednesday\u2019s Kadeem Harris saw red in stoppage time. Swansea had a stoppage-time effort ruled out as Brentford took a share of the points in an intriguing 1-1 draw. In a repeat of last season\u2019s play-off semi-final, the Bees took the lead in style when Bryan Mbeumo\u2019s powerful run found the overlapping Mathias Jensen, who crossed first time for Ivan Toney to slam home his 10th of the season. Andre Ayew equalised with 13 minutes to go, bundling home Matt Grimes\u2019s cross. Norwich stretched their unbeaten Championship run to six matches but it was a frustrating night at Carrow Road as they were held to a goalless draw by Millwall. The goalkeeper Bartosz Bialkowski was in fine form while at the other end the Lions rarely troubled Tim Krul, although the substitute Shaun Williams nearly won it at the death with a shot which clipped the angle of post and crossbar. Bristol City scored twice in the closing 13 minutes to earn a 2-1 comeback win at Huddersfield. It looked like Huddersfield would take the points following Josh Koroma\u2019s 43rd-minute opener but Jay Dasilva tapped home from a yard out after 77 minutes and Jamie Paterson won it for City six minutes later to halt a five-match winless run. Cardiff were 3-0 winners over struggling Barnsley, Junior Hoilett, Joe Ralls and Harry Wilson with the goals, while Blackburn and Middlesbrough fought out a 0-0 draw at Ewood Park. Jon Mellish dented Newport\u2019s impressive start to the League Two season as Carlisle survived a late fightback to beat the leaders in a five-goal thriller. The Cumbrians took an early lead through Lewis Alessandra\u2019s penalty and looked to be cruising when midfielder Mellish helped himself to a double which put them 3-0 ahead with just nine minutes remaining. Late strikes from Jamie Devitt and Josh Sheehan left the home side hanging on, but they avoided further damage to take the points. The Welsh side remain top by two points from Cambridge, 2-1 winners over Salford. At the other end of the table, there were important wins for Bradford and Oldham to ease them away from the scrap at the bottom. The veteran Walsall defender Mat Sadler struck the only goal 16 minutes from time to sink his former club Crawley and end a five-game wait for a win. And Antoni Sarcevic was Bolton\u2019s saviour as his last-minute equaliser snatched a 1-1 home draw with Mansfield."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
