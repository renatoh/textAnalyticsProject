But their average claim is just \u00a318,960 - far lower than for MPs - and one in seven sitting peers do not claim a penny from the public purse, according to newly published figures. The contrast with the House of Commons, where the average MP claimed \u00a3122,678 on top of a \u00a357,485 salary, is striking, though the range of claims in the upper house also shows huge variations. The crossbench Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate, a former president of the Police Superintendents Association, claimed the most in 2004-5, a total of \u00a360,013 for travel, living costs, stationery and staff. But he was also one of those most present, clocking up 100% attendance of 152 working days. Yet he only made eight contributions to debates, compared with 15 by Lord Taylor of Blackburn, Labour's top claimant (\u00a357,646), and 60 by Lady Walmsley, the top Lib Dem claimant (\u00a353,890). Lord Redesdale, the highest claiming hereditary peer (\u00a352,613) and a Lib Dem whip, intervened 46 times. Fellow grandees such as Lord Carrington, ex-foreign secretary, attended 32 times but claimed nothing. He was one of 98 of the 705 life and hereditary peers who made no claims. Expenses details for peers and MPs were published this week. The latest accounts of peers have been published for only the second time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
