Scores achieved in the \"abstract reasoning\" exam, worth a quarter of the marks in the UK Clinical Aptitude test (UKCAT), have been ditched after problems were identified by exams company Pearson Vue. The UKCAT was introduced by a coalition of 26 medical and dental schools two years ago to help them discriminate between the thousands of straight-A applications they receive. Students, who pay \u00a375 to take the test, answer four sections online at one of their test centres. An email sent to applicants on Monday said: \"UKCAT has some concerns about the abstract reasoning subtest this year. To ensure absolute fairness to all candidates, medical and dental schools have been informed and therefore have not and will not take into consideration this component of the UKCAT results.\" Students applied for medical and dental schools in October after receiving the original scores. When the alarm was raised the institutions revised scores, leaving some downgraded applicants claiming they had mistakenly applied for universities that were out of their league. Nicola Fardell, 28, from Brighton, whose mark decreased, has been turned down for interviews at two of the four institutions she applied for. \"I can't get into Oxford or King's, possibly because my result was lower than I thought,\" she said. \"They say this test shows how rounded you are as a person. How can they know that when a quarter of the result is removed?\" This is the second big problem to hit student and trainee medics in 2007. Earlier this year the then health secretary, Patricia Hewitt, was forced to abandon a controversial online system for junior doctors to apply for training as consultants. Ian Noble, the chairman of the British Medical Association student committee, said: \"Faith is being lost in how reliable these systems are to help select the best doctors for the future.\" David Willetts, the shadow universities minister, said: \"Yet another group of people who have lost out as a result of incompetence in data handling.\" Katie Petty-Saphon, the director of UKCAT and executive director of the Medical Schools Council, said: \"Admission tutors are confident that they haven't rejected anyone on the basis of the change.\" A spokesman for Pearson Vue said: \"On the rare occasion when there is an issue with a test our priority is to ensure that no candidate is put at a disadvantage.\" Its sister firm, Pearson Driving Assessments, is at the centre of the row over the loss of the personal records of 3 million learner drivers. Yesterday Stephen Ladyman, who was transport minister when the loss occurred, defended his decision to keep it secret. It emerged yesterday that Revenue and Customs has lost a computer cartridge containing personal details of 6,500 customers of a private pension firm in Wales."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
