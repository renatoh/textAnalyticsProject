But Britain and Russia are more intricately involved with each other today than ever was the case in the days of the Soviet Union. There is a large community of Russian citizens in Britain. There are sizeable trade contracts, and major diplomatic incidents affect everyone - businessmen, investors and teachers, students and artists on cultural exchanges. The world-weary could suggest that Russia and Britain will keep on trading regardless of the outcome of the latest spat. But the case of the poisoned Russian exile matters, because it goes to the heart of what happens when one state fails to live by another's rules, but still demands the benefits of travel and access to that country. The foreign secretary, David Miliband, said Britain was not being anti-Russian in its response. Russia remains an international partner which Britain will continue to consult on the Middle East process, the status of Kosovo and Iran. Mr Miliband was also right to say that this was not a situation which Britain had sought, but one it had no choice but to address. A Russian exile was killed in a way which set off a major radioactive contamination scare in the centre of London. It is absurd to imagine that any government would shrug its shoulders and look the other way while it was that alleged that a former member of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) had settled an old score by spraying polonium into a pot of green tea. Mr Litvinenko was a former FSB agent, but he was also a British citizen to whom the British government and its courts have responsibilities. Russia offered to put the chief suspect for his murder, Andrei Lugovoi, on trial in Moscow. But there could have been no guarantee that such a high-profile case would not have been free from political interference. The Russian judicial system is not independent from the executive, and standards of justice in Russia fall well short of standards in the rest of Europe. A large proportion of the cases before the European court of human rights in Strasbourg come from Russia for this reason. It is true that Russian demands for the extradition of the exiled billionaire Boris Berezovsky and the Chechen envoy Akmed Zakayev failed in this country. That happened not because there was no case to answer, but because it was easy to prove to the satifaction of a British magistrate that their trial was politically motivated. However, to imagine that an organisation as powerful in Russia today as the FSB would let a panel of judges convict a former employee such as Mr Lugovoi for the murder of an exile whom most in Russia consider a traitor is just pie in the sky. Russia has accused Britain of seeking to politicise the Litvinenko case by applying for something that London knows in advance that it will not get: the extradition of Russian citizens is prohibited under the constitution. But if Russia is seeking to integrate itself into the world business community, if it seeks for its citizens greater freedom of movement and fewer visa restrictions, if it seeks to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism, it has also got to live by the rules that most other European states subject themselves to. Extradition should not be seen as a political instrument. It is reasonable to expect amendments to the Russian constitution that would allow extradition to take place from Russia. The expulsions are not, in themselves, a solution. They could worsen relations. They are not likely to bring about Mr Lugovoi's extradition. But they are a firm signal of intent. Other states in Europe should take note. Confrontation is in no one's interest. But nor is letting freelance murders take place on the streets of London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
