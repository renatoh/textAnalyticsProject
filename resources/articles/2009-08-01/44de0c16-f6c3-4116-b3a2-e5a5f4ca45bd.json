The legend who fought two world title matches was the star of the tournament played alongside the England v Netherlands match, finished third, beat the winner Jan Timman, and averaged over 60 moves per game. Other greats like Emanuel Lasker and Vassily Smyslov have been strong in old age, but none has remained so competitive as the man who, as a child, survived the siege of Leningrad by using ration books of dead relatives. The game below was Korchnoi's fastest win at Simpsons in the Strand, and is interesting from several aspects. His opponent Terence Chapman backed the event as well as playing in it. As a teenager, Chapman was England's No3 junior after Jon Speelman and Jon Mestel who both became strong grandmasters. Then he abandoned chess to make his fortune in the City. Returning to active play in his fifties, he performed well in an odds match against Garry Kasparov and this year has beaten some highly rated opponents in fine style. Chapman launched a subtle opening idea, the Modern Benoni as White with an extra move. Korchnoi was alert to the trick, and his Nh6-f7 knight development made for a thematic fight where Black advanced in the centre, White on the Q-side. An inaccuracy (19...d3!) gave Chapman a chance for a clear edge (29 Be3! and if Rxb4 30 Rd1 or Nxb4 30 Nc3 Ra3 31 Qb2 gaining material with active bishops supporting Q-side pawns). As played, Korchnoi's queen-rook attack down the central lines proved crushing.
