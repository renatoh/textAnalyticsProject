It also mentions plot points in the movie Moon. Well, wasn't that an amazing finale? Orphan Black really was one of the most unexpected TV treats of 2013, one that delivered consistently and left things wide open for a second season with expanded scope. I could go on at length about how smart it was, with clever touches like the episode titles \u2013 Variations Under Domestication, Endless Forms Most Beautiful \u2013 being named after chapters from Darwin's On the Origin Of Species. Or how weird it got. Or just how great it was at keeping things tense no matter how ridiculous things got, or how funny it was throughout. But let's just stick with the truly remarkable, groundbreaking even, aspect of the show: the performance, or rather performances, by Tatiana Maslany as the clones. It's the kind of gig that'll ensure she'll always be in work as well as something to be enjoyed and marvelled at. I worked on the movie Moon and saw, first hand, just how tough things were for actor and crew when the more seasoned Sam Rockwell played two characters in the same scene. Lord knows how hard it was for Maslany, with scenes where she's playing three characters, there are huge chunks of the show where she's the only performer onscreen, albeit as several different people. Sarah Well, she had me fooled. I honestly thought Maslany was a Brit, an expat, going by her accent. Some criticised her few slips in the opening episode, claiming she sounded Australian at times, but for a Canadian attempting Estuary English it was pretty spot on. I think people would have been easier on her had they known just how many characters and accents were ahead for Maslany. That her base character wasn't in her native tongue is yet another point in her favour. Plus Sarah was supposed to have been raised, by an Irish mother, everywhere from Brixton to all over the US and Canada. I've met people with similar upbringing and that's pretty much how they talk. Alison Perhaps the best performance of them all. This \"soccer mom\" role would have been easy to coast through as a strident harridan, but Maslany delivered a truly rounded credible character with many layers. Also very likeable, Alison proved smart, resourceful, hard working and a loving mother to her two adopted kids. She seemed the one with the most to lose, the most normal life to hang on to. If things got bad she couldn't just disappear. Plenty of black humour here too, torturing her husband in the cellar while a social gathering goes on upstairs. Her attitude and posture was so unlike the others. If Maslany had only played Alison she'd still be getting plenty of praise. Cosima The very handy science geek, the clone who had the clearest understanding of just what exactly was going on. Cosima seems to be the clone the most comfortable in her own skin, relaxed and cool. She even gives Maslany the chance to do some romantic scenes, albiet ones with several layers of weirdness as she forms a relationship with her monitor, Delphine. Again, very different body language. She was much looser than Sarah or Alison, and Maslany totally nailed her bookish charm. Helena The most dangerous and tragic of the clones. Near feral, Helena suffered cruelty and abuse, was brought up in a Ukranian convent and housed in a cage (when not out on assassination missions). She's also the most lonely, Maslany gives an impressive mix of violence and childlike sadness, she could appear confused and hurt, it's easy to feel both scared and sorry for her. Brainwashed to the point of mental instability, a self-harmer who also takes small delights in the sensual world \u2013 like her bizarre way of eating puddings. Another great example of a character that had a lot more going on than first appeared, and yet another feather in Maslany's cap. Miscellaneous This is where things got even more complex and enjoyable, when Maslany got to play one clone pretending to be another. Most notable was her long running impersonation of police detective, Beth, who we saw take a dive into the path of a train in episode one. As Sarah pretended to be Beth we saw Maslany stuggle with an accent (the slips were intentional and often put her at risk). There was also the episode where Sarah had to cover for Alison (who was zonked out on booze and \"happy pills\"), this was something of a masterclass from Maslany in overlapping character traits yet keeping them separate enough for the viewer to keep track of what was going on.The show left us with the reveal of yet another clone, the mysterious Rachel who I am sure we'll be seeing plenty of in season two. Even if the show wasn't to your tastes there's no denying what a truly astounding turn it was from Maslany. Adopting another role or character has been seen before in TV, in the undercover missions in Alias or with the downloaded agents of Dollhouse, but never to this extent. All this has got Maslany noticed, with awards and nominations putting her alongside performers much better known than her. For a relatively unknown actor to carry a show is hard enough, but to do so in so many expertly delivered roles really is without precedent. Did you see Orphan Black? Impressed?
