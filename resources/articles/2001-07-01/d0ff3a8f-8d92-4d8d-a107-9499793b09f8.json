The American government, which has tense relations with China, said its athletes would compete in Beijing and that the decision about where the games take place was up to the International Olympic Committee. Condoleezza Rice, George Bush's national security adviser, said: \"We understand that this was a decision for the IOC to take. What we do know is that American athletes are going to go there, and they're going to compete and hopefully bring home lots of gold medals.\" President Bush was said to be neutral on the issue. Ms Rice said the US remained concerned about the state of human rights in China. She said: \"The president has made very clear that human rights will be on the agenda. We have a human rights agenda with China, I think the Chinese expect it and we'll continue to pursue that in our bilateral relationship.\" A spokesman for the British government said: \"We very much hope that the Olympics will play a positive role in China.\" The island state of Taiwan, which is not officially recognised by China, said it hoped that the decision to award Beijing the games would decrease tension in the region. The Tibetan government in exile, which is based in India, criticised the IOC for awarding the games to Beijing. China has been accused of carrying out widespread human rights abuses in Tibet after invading the region in 1950. Kalon TC Tethong, spokesman for the exiled Tibetan government, said the Olympic Games would mean more repression, referring to \"the suffering that will be unleashed on ordinary people by a totalitarian one-party state which will assume that it has received international permission for its horrendous repression\". While officially western governments remained tight-lipped, individual politicians said the IOC was wrong to choose Beijing. In Washington, Tom Lantos, the house international relations committee's leading Democrat, said: \"It truly boggles the mind. This decision will allow the Chinese police state to bask in the reflected glory of the Olympic Games despite having one of the most abominable human rights records in the world.\" In Europe, the French were most critical of China's human rights record and the IOC's decision. Fran\u00e7ois Loncle, the head of parliament's foreign affairs committee, said: \"Following the example of Nazi Germany in 1936 and the Soviet Union in 1980, communist China will use the games as a powerful propaganda instrument destined to consolidate its hold on power.\" Related articles 14.07.2001: 'It is our turn.
