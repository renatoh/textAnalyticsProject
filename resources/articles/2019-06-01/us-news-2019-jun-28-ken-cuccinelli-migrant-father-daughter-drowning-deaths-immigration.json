Ken Cuccinelli was named earlier this month as acting head of US Immigration and Citizenship Services (USCIS), the agency that handles immigration administration. He told CNN he was not concerned the photo would become emblematic of the Trump administration\u2019s hardline immigration policy. \u201cThe reason we have tragedies like that on the border is because that father didn\u2019t wait to go through the asylum process in the legal fashion and decided to cross the river and not only died but his daughter died tragically as well,\u201d Cuccinelli said on Thursday night. The photographs, taken on Monday, show \u00d3scar Alberto Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez, 26, and his 23-month-old daughter Valeria lying face down in shallow water after dying in the Rio Grande, the river that divides Mexico from Texas. The image has been compared to the 2015 image of three-year-old Syrian boy Aylan Kurdi, who drowned off the Greek island of Kos after being en route there with other refugees fleeing conflict. The bodies of the young father and daughter have been repatriated to their native El Salvador, accompanied by Mart\u00ednez\u2019s wife, Vanessa \u00c1valos, 21, who was standing on the riverbank when her husband and daughter were swept away by the current. As part of a broader crackdown on migration, the Trump administration has further restricted asylum and the backlog of legal cases. Migrants are routinely forced to wait for months south of the US border in order to start the asylum process, which has in turn driven people to make more dangerous border crossings such as trying to wade or swim across the treacherous Rio Grande. Cuccinelli is the latest immigration hardliner the Trump administration has appointed to a senior government role, despite warnings from his own Republican party in the US Senate that Cuccinelli was unlikely to be confirmed to the permanent role. In the past decade, Cuccinelli has said homosexual acts are \u201cintrinsically wrong,\u201d been tied to anti-Muslim and anti-LGBTQ campaigners and was criticized for a comment that seemed to compare immigrants to rats. In 2018, he advocated for using \u201cwar powers\u201d against migrants in an interview with the conservative website Breitbart News. He also said the US was not required to \u201ckeep\u201d migrants, including asylum-seekers. \u201cYou just point them back across the river and let them swim for it,\u201d Cuccinelli said. Cuccinelli is also facing opposition from Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives and the union that represents about 13,000 USCIS workers. The union\u2019s president, Danielle Spooner, said the appointment of Cuccinelli \u201cspells the end of legal immigration as we know it\u201d. In June, House committee leaders said they had \u201cdeep concern\u201d about Cuccinelli\u2019s appointment because it circumvents rules about federal vacancies in a letter to the acting homeland security secretary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
