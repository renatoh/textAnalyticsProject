Not the store so much as the gasps and astonished sounds of astonished wonderment coming from the throng as Jobs showed them the Regent Street store - followed by, of course, spontaneous rapture when Steve said it was the biggest Apple store in the world and that it was already the second-biggest selling store they had. And isn't that just great? A point of interest: he also said Apple was planning to open new stores across the UK over the coming year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
