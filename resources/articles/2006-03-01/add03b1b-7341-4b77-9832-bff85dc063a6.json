Although the Australian quartet - Peter Dawson, Matthew Goss, Ashley Hutchinson and Stephen Wooldridge - started quickly to move 0.232sec ahead after the first kilometre, they faded rapidly and, after the English team opened up a lead just short of two seconds by the halfway point, the result was never in doubt. England's Victoria Pendleton doubled the night's gold tally for English cyclists with an impressive win over Australia's Anna Meares in a photo-finish in the final of the women's sprint. Pendleton beat Meares to win the world title last spring and looked on course to repeat the victory when she won the first of the best-of-three series. Meares, however, took the contest to a third race and edged away from the world champion going into the final bend. But Pendleton threw her bike forward to hit the line just inches ahead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
