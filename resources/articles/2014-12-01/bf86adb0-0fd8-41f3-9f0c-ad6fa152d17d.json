The human loss was sad enough. Now the siege has become an episode in a global war, announced by white calligraphy on black fabric. The flag\u2019s Arabic brought into view \u2013 and again into contest \u2013 foreign Islam as a radical opposite. The hijacker knew its impact. He banked on it. He played for it. The contrast of the black flag with Lindt\u2019s Christmas decorations couldn\u2019t have been sharper \u2013 celebration against disruption, festival against siege. The initial lines from the siege have been the typical ones: there was some political motivation that explained Monis\u2019s use of the Islamic flag. He was either an authentic representative of \u201cradical\u201d Islam, or a disaffected lone wolf who had no real right to the symbols of Islam. But Man Haron Monis had no deeper \u201cpolitical\u201d motivation behind his use of the flag. He did not belong to any official terror organisation. The pack he belongs to is the group of isolated people who are brought together by a sense of alienation, frustration, a breakdown in social bonds, and their use of the symbolism and language of violence. The lone wolf\u2019s fantasises of returning us to the \u201creal\u201d of Iraq, Syria, and the Islamic State all come after the flag is flown, not before it. Before he displayed the flag, he was just another gunman. Afterwards, the symbol rewrote Monis\u2019s violent past and gave grammar to his attack. Hours into the siege, a second symbol emerged. Monis, a Shia who claimed a recent conversion to Sunni Islam, demanded that the flag of the Islamic State (Isis) be brought to him. This was jarring, and telling. It said everything that needed to be said: he needed the correct flag for the fantasy to continue. The main point here is to recognise how the fantasy itself cannot reproduce itself without making an appeal to Islamic symbols as foreign and threatening. It is the flag that calls forward the fantasy; behind it, Monis went from being a desperate and haphazard captor to the authentic representative of an international radical movement. Mainstream Muslims have typically asked for a view beyond narrow symbols and stereotypes. Take a closer look, we\u2019re normal Australians, and so forth. By calling for respect \u2013 even if such a call is just for our own catharsis \u2013 we hope to combat generalisations and win back our religion from the radical few. We request at least a nod to our diversity, our humanity, our moderate tradition. It has become habitual to suggest that the stereotype of the Muslim as a violent threat comes from a distorted reading of Islam \u2013 that the lone wolf radical is a perverted version of the everyday Muslim. Such is the power of the symbol of radical Islam, where the central testimony of the religion \u2013 the Shahada \u2013 is turned into a radical\u2019s standard, that we might now have to concede that the reality is the opposite of our hopes. That the symbols of our religion, lost to the matrix of debates and images within global media, have a life greater than our own. It is the stereotype that really lives, exercising a distorting influence on the everyday Muslim. What we are fighting is the knowledge that Islam, in its modern manifestation, is a potent grammar for grievance and retaliation. Both Islam\u2019s critics and its lone wolves understand this. Its symbols explain catastrophe, fear, departure \u2013 even as they invoke God. Whatever Monis\u2019s motivation, background, political readings of events, whatever ill-driven desire he had, is not somehow \u201chidden\u201d behind a religious narrative. The truly scary thought is that he is a symptom of the religious narrative of today; he is part of the religious narrative, not outside it. Religion, in its deepest anomie, is often evoked as a particular counter-culture, instead of as a substantial way of organising life. So often what legitimises it is not its truth-claims, but the rather the way it allows its subjects to express their innermost feelings against modern progressive attitudes. The truly suffocating realisation is this: the symbol of violence itself is motivation enough to send the lone wolves into the streets, to cause violence against the modern world from which they are alienated. Is it not that the very style of these messages repeats that Islam is the radical Other? Like automatons, those with grievances, with criminal pasts awaiting trial, have now learned the phraseology of otherness and resistance, through the employment of symbols. Beneath that black flag lurks some unspeakably monstrous dimension, exposed through attacks like Monis\u2019s. The spectre of the violent jihadist haunts our social imaginary. In response, that imaginary has become a place to play, and a place to redeem criminality and intolerance by turning them into a false pursuit of justice. Monis\u2019s use of the flag was detached from the reality the symbols of Islam ought to represent. It was detached from the communities who own these symbols. It was detached from knowledge, detached from debates, detached from Islamic law. It was detached even from his own life. Perhaps most tellingly, it was detached from Isis itself, who would never have accepted him, and need not accept him to carry out violence in their flag\u2019s name."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
