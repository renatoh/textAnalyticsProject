More can so easily mean less \u2013 but try persuading any cricket administrator of that. Thus the opening fixture of the season, MCC against Durham, the proud and worthy county champions of 2008, became another exercise in April foolishness. A cold blanket of grey cloud enveloped St John's Wood and no cricketers were in sight. Which was a pity for several reasons. The County Championship, the unassuming nursery of English cricketers, will struggle to grab the attention in such a congested summer, which has the first Test \u2013 against West Indies \u2013 commencing on 6 May, the Twenty20 World Cup for all sexes in June and the small matter of the Ashes in July and August. Once the leaves are out only the diehards will focus on the domestic game. It was also a pity for a number of the MCC team, most notably the former England captain Michael Vaughan, who is desperate to relaunch his Test career. Vaughan does not have much time to impress the selectors and whoever takes up the post of team director. At Lord's this week he had the chance to infiltrate the headlines with a barnstorming century to announce his readiness to return. Hereafter he has just two championship matches for Yorkshire before the first Test. But so far Vaughan has been restricted to the indoor nets and we are now inoculated against paying any attention to the fact that he is \"hitting 'em well in the nets\". Unusually England are expected to name a squad for the first Test within the next 10 days \u2013 the early announcement of about 15 names is partly due to the IPL commitments of some of the players. Expect Vaughan to be in that squad, but he will need some runs somewhere to command a place in the final 11. The temptation to restore Vaughan to the Test team quickly is understandable. There is a gap there since neither Ian Bell nor Owais Shah convinced at number three in the Caribbean. We do not know whether Vaughan is still up to the job, but it would be better to find out before the Ashes series is underway. This is the justification for his premature return, which might seem unfair on some of the other candidates but which suits the longer term goals of those in charge. (Incidentally the assumption remains that this number will include Andy Flower, who is likely to be appointed the team director within the next week or two after a few more elaborate contortions from the ECB.) Of the other players marooned in the pavilion, Bell probably needs a greater volume of runs than Vaughan for his restoration and an interesting summer may await Rob Key, MCC's captain for this game. Key, without doing much and with the advantage of not being in England's recent Twenty20 sides, has surfaced as the likeliest candidate to lead the national team in the World Twenty20. Which is quite a surprise and a triumph for the process of elimination. Key, though hardly a gazelle in the field, is not a bad Twenty20 player, but he is not that good either. He is an astute, popular captain of Kent and feels like something of a grand old man of county cricket even though he is still in his 20s. But his would be a remarkable elevation: because Kevin Pietersen does not want the captaincy back just yet, because Andrew Flintoff cannot be relied upon to be fit, because Paul Collingwood has had his go, because Andrew Strauss, despite some sparky efforts in the Caribbean, is not suited to this form of the game nor is Test vice-captain, Alastair Cook. Key might just have the chutzpah to carry off the job even though at first glance the idea of him suddenly captaining England seems as absurd as trying to play cricket in the first weeks of April. Or maybe Key is not experienced enough, which leads us to an even more deliciously absurd idea. Step forward Shaun Udal, one of our men to watch at the age of 40. This is because Udal is also in the preliminary 30-man squad for the Twenty20 tournament. Why pick an old man unless you want to play him?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
