With sleet driving into the faces of the Exiles in the second half, the fly-half's kick was made extra difficult. \"It's not the first time I've had to take a penalty in the last minute, but the conditions made it extra tough,\" said Everitt. \"But it was vital to win with games against Wasps and Leicester over the holiday and we deserved the victory. I just had to put the significance of the kick to the back of my mind.\" Everitt's winning kick was a dramatic conclusion to a game Saracens looked to have snatched themselves moments earlier when Everitt's opposite number, Glen Jackson, put them ahead for the first time with his fourth penalty. Then, with 11 minutes of added time played, the Irish substitute, Mike Catt, who had been on the field for only seconds, was tackled by Dan Scarbrough and the Saracens full-back was judged not to have rolled away. Everitt took his opportunity from 40 metres to put Irish third in the Premiership and five points clear of Saracens. Oddly for a game featuring the Exiles, the only current Ireland international was the Saracens hooker, Shane Byrne. But Everitt could be pushing Ronan O'Gara for the international No10 slot on this form and yesterday's London Irish captain, Bob Casey also pressed his case. The lock led a gargantuan Exiles pack with the Saracens coach, Steve Diamond, admitting his forwards had been given \"a good hiding\" in the first half. Saracens missed their powerful Springbok prop, Cobus Visagie, with the Exiles front row that featured two South Africans, Danie Coetzee and Faan Rautenbach, and the South African-raised prop, Neil Hatley, giving them an edge. From a scrum midway through the first half, the visitors scored their only try when they moved the ball to the right and Everitt kicked ahead for Michael Horak who took advantage of a perfect bounce to dive over. The Irish full-back was wearing a pair of black tights, probably not a rugby fashion to catch on, but a sensible barrier to the cold all the same. Things got pretty heated after the break, though, with a brawl six minutes into the second half leading to yellow cards for Ben Skirving, the Saracens No8, and the Irish wing, Delon Armitage. The Irish defence was finally breached with 10 minutes of normal time remaining when Saracens' New Zealand prop, Hamish Mitchell, who had come on as a second-half substitute, scored the first try for his new club. Saracens moved the ball smartly to the right wing, Tevita Vaikona was tackled by the Irish scrum-half, Paul Hodgson, but the ball was made free and Mitchell powered over. The try set up a pulsating finale, but it was the Exiles' followers who went home with a warm glow.
