Most of the first wave dealt with prejudice, the social exclusion of immigrants, unemployment and the importance of strong community feeling. In 2003, Wondrous Oblivion nostalgically revisited those times with a story of a Jewish family of Holocaust survivors living next door to a Jamaican family of Windrush immigrants in south London in 1960. The film's star, Delroy Lindo, was born of Jamaican parents in south-east London and was 19 when he went to the States, where he has become a major Hollywood star. He would not have attained such status had he remained in this country. There was occasional violence in these early movies, invariably inflicted by whites on blacks, and references to drugs, but there was an underlying sense of optimism, a feeling that time would bring beneficial change. For many, of course, it has, mainly professionals of various kinds, performers and musicians. But Saul Dibb's Bullet Boy, set in a predominantly black area of east London that includes the infamous 'Murder Mile', takes a bleak look at a community divided against itself, simmering with violence, low on hope. It is not wholly despairing, though. The film does see possibilities in the restoration of positive male role models and the rejection of a gun culture. It is, in fact, the nearest the British cinema has come to the power and honesty of John Singleton's 1991 picture about life in South Central LA, Boyz N the Hood, which in essential ways it resembles. Bullet Boy views life through the eyes of two brothers - 19-year-old Ricky (played by Ashley Walters, a member of the notorious rap group So Solid Crew) and 12-year-old Curtis (the non-professional Luke Fraser) - and takes place over a couple of days that change their lives. Ricky has completed a year in jail for stabbing a man in an affray (Walters himself served seven months for gun possession) and is picked up from a rural prison by his best friend, the ironically named Wisdom (Leon Black), a drug dealer and petty criminal. Little Curtis has bunked off school and stowed away in Wisdom's car. His emergence from the darkness of the car's boot in which he's locked is a metaphor for the possibility of his own release from a society and set of false values in which he's trapped. For Ricky, on the other hand, there is little chance of escape, which we realise the moment Wisdom welcomes him back into the macho world by restoring to him his old gun. Ricky wants to go straight and start a new life with his girlfriend, but even before the gun is returned to him, things are going wrong. Immediately on returning to London, Wisdom and Ricky are involved in a row with another group of black men over a broken wing mirror. Respect is at stake and, over the next 48 hours, a vendetta escalates, from a dog being shot dead via the destruction of a car to a couple of murders. But though Ricky tries to end the circle of violence, he's hopelessly in thrall to this macho culture. Instead of going straight from jail to the welcome-home party his devoted mother has prepared, he goes clubbing with his girl and on a revenge trip with Wisdom. When he does return in the early hours, he doesn't apologise. Instead, he asks what kind of pussy would allow his mother to pick him up from jail. No mention is made of his absent, delinquent father, but for young Curtis there is a father figure in the form of the jovial, caring Leon (stand-up comic Curtis Walker), a reformed criminal turned pastor to an evangelical religious group. There is, in effect, a contest for the allegiance and future life of Curtis between the doomed Ricky, whom the small lad worships, and their mother, who has hopes of him receiving a proper education. The contest is resolved in a painful, tragic manner. The film's one brief moment of happiness is a visit that Ricky, his girlfriend and Curtis make to an ice rink. The final rejection of violence through the throwing away of a gun is a trifle glib, though the same charge could be made against a hundred westerns as well as the casting of Excalibur into the lake. Director Saul Dibb, whose first film this is, comes from TV documentaries; his co-screenwriter, Catherine Johnson, lives in Hackney and has been writer-in-residence at Holloway prison; cinematographer Marcel Zyskind has worked with Michael Winterbottom (most notably on the semi-documentary In This World). They've given their low-budget movie a sense of authenticity. The cast, a mixture of professionals and non-professionals, has contributed not merely through their response to Dibb's direction but also in partially improvising their scenes. They are all fine, especially Luke Fraser. We are not only viewing the world from his perspective, but we are also looking into his puzzled and puzzling mind through his big, sad, expressive eyes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
