A 1-0 defeat that night ended with Thierry Henry angrily accusing the Greek team of diving; Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has warned his players to keep their cool at Highbury. Henry, by his own admission, went \"mad\" in protest at what he described as \"digraceful\" behaviour. \"See you in London,\" the striker remarked. Temperament may prove as crucial as talent this evening as Wenger attempts to wind up his side. \"Yes, but we would be guilty to be upset by that, because we know that will not make us win the game,\" the manager said. \"That's something that should not bother us at all. The end of the game in Athens was heated but we have to concentrate on playing well. We know we can beat Panathinaikos with a good peformance and if we concentrate on playing football. The confidence and belief is there.\" The importance of staying focused can hardly be overstated. Failure to beat the group leaders would leave Arsenal only the slimmest hope of progressing, particularly if Real Mallorca defeat Schalke at home. After reaching the quarter-finals last season, falling at the first hurdle is unthinkable in terms of stature and finance. \"We are not even considering that,\" Wenger said. \"We want to consider a much more positive approach. We will go through if we play at our best level.\" Positive was a constant theme of the Frenchman's words. He knows Arsenal were \"too timid\" for much of the match in Athens and will demand a stronger, more adventurous start against a dangerous side who have won three out of three without conceding a goal. \"We have to approach this game in a much more positive way,\" said Wenger, who promised to address the problem in away matches. An unbeaten European record of 10 wins and three draws at Highbury under Wenger suggests belief this time should be high. A more clinical performance than at Southampton on Saturday looks vital, though, against a team who may be cautious knowing a point will see them all but qualify. \"The concentration will be sharper because on occasions like this you are prepared for the fact when you are a striker that you will get less chances,\" he said. \"There is also a determination to put up a high-level performance because we want to go through, so the concentration will be higher.\" Five of the Greeks who held England in their World Cup qualifying group are likely to start. Giorgios Karagounis, who impressed at Old Trafford, promises danger on the counter-attack, so concentration will be crucial in defence, where Martin Keown returns from suspension to partner Sol Campbell. Behind them Richard Wright starts his first European game in the absence of the injured David Seaman. \"This is the sort of game for which I wanted to come to a club like Arsenal,\" the 23-year-old said. On a pressurised night Wenger needs cool heads, not only from Wright. Arsenal (4-4-2, possible): Wright; Lauren, Keown, Campbell, Cole; Ljungberg, Vieira, Pires, Van Bronckhorst; Wiltord, Henry. Panathinaikos (4-4-2, possible): Nikopolidis; Henriksen, Vokolos, Kirgiakos, Fissas; Michaelsen, Paulo Sousa, Basinas, Karagounis; Vlaovic, Olisadebe. Referee: U Meier (Switzerland)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
