The FTSE 100 has closed 6 points lower at 7,416 points. Mark Carney\u2019s concerns about no-deal worries hurting the economy weighted on the market, with the pound hovering below $1.27 still. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at www.cityindex.co.uk, says trade war optimism was limited too: Comments from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin that a US \u2013 Sino trade deal was 90% done has fuelled optimism that the two sides could finally achieve a trade agreement. US equities have moved higher in early trade on the news, paring some of yesterday\u2019s Fed inspired losses. Any good news on trade is good news for the equity markets. However, the reaction is actually fairly tame to the attention-grabbing headline, both the Dow and the S&amp;P are up around 0.2% and parts of Europe remain in the red. Investors are not getting carried away opting to sit on the side-lines as they look cautiously ahead to the G20 summit this weekend. A side meeting between Trump and China\u2019s President Jinping Xi could give vital clues as to whether the two powers are onside to resolve the ongoing trade dispute. Wall Street has opened higher, as investors are cheered by Stephen Mnuchin\u2019s claim that the US-China trade deal is 90% complete. Tech shares are among the risers, despite Donald Trump\u2019s threat to sue the likes of Twitter and Google.... Donald Trump attacked tech companies today, because he reckons they discriminate against him because he\u2019s a Republican. He told Fox that social media firms such as Twitter are unfairly throttling his follower numbers (a claim he\u2019s made before). He also cites a recording released yesterday of a Google executive discussing plans to prevent another \u201cTrump situation\u201d. The president says: \u201cTwitter is just terrible, what they do. They don\u2019t let you get the word out. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, they should be sued because what\u2019s happening with the bias \u2014 and now you see it with that executive yesterday from Google. The hatred for the Republicans: It\u2019s not even like \u2018Gee! Let\u2019s lean Democrat.\u2019\u201d \u201cThese people are all Democrats, it\u2019s totally biased toward Democrats. If I announced tomorrow that I\u2019m going to become a nice liberal Democrat, I would pick up five times more followers. Take a deep breath before watching this clip of Donald Trump rubbishing America\u2019s top central banker on Fox News today: Back in the UK, Bathstore, the country\u2019s biggest bathroom specialist, has collapsed into administration after failing to find a buyer, putting more than 500 jobs at risk. Just the latest in a string of retail failures that have cost tens of thousands of jobs this year. Here\u2019s the full story: Wowzers. Donald Trump has suggested he could widen his trade war to include Vietnam. Here\u2019s a clip from his Fox News appearance: The Financial Times have a good take on Mark Carney\u2019s criticism of investment funds built on the \u201clie\u201d of instant redemptions. Here\u2019s a flavour: The Bank of England governor said that all fund investors should expect to have redemption terms that were in line with the liquidity of the assets that underpinned them and should not be able to assume they could get their hands on their money daily. \u201cThese funds are built on a lie, which is you can have daily liquidity,\u201d Mr Carney told MPs on the Treasury select committee. For assets that \u201cfundamentally aren\u2019t liquid\u201d or might become illiquid in a market downturn, he said the damage of that \u201clie\u201d for financial stability is that it \u201cleads to an expectation for individuals that it\u2019s not that different from having money in a bank\u201d. \u201cWe do have to be very deliberate about the types of measures that need to be taken \u2014 something that better aligns the redemption terms with the actual liquidity of the underlying investment is infinitely preferable to the situation we have today,\u201d the governor said. Donald Trump has used an interview on Fox News to blast a range of targets - from America\u2019s top central banker to its largest tech companies. He also took a swipe at Japan, shortly before heading to Tokyo for the G20 summit: Newsflash from America: Durable goods orders fell sharply last month, raising new fears about the health of the US economy. New orders for durable goods (such as transportation and machinery) fell by 1.3% in May, led by a drop in airline sales. That follows a 2.8% tumble in April, and is weaker than expected. Demand for capital goods (expensive equipment) fell by 3.3%, and computer-related orders slid by 2.4%. City experts say Mark Carney is correct to predict interest rates would be cut after a no-deal Brexit. Joshua Roberts, associate director at JCRA, says investors had already worked this out for themselves: \u201cCarney\u2019s comments are hardly a revelation for the market, which has been judging a rate cut as more likely than a hike for over a month. The logic is inescapable: if the flow of goods and services between the UK and its most important trading partner is severely disrupted, the Bank of England has a duty to try and stabilise the resulting economic shock.\u201d Oliver Blackbourn, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, says the Bank is in the hands of Westminster: Carney made it clear that he and some others on the MPC favour more support in the event of a no-deal Brexit. With the Brexit forecast assumption dependent on government policy, we are back to awaiting the new Prime Minister and their ability to manage parliament for indications of future BoE decisions.\u201d Mark Carney has given his strongest hint yet that the Bank of England could cut interest rates back toward record lows, if Britain crashed out of the EU without a deal. The BoE governor told the Treasury committee that many policymakers, himself included, believe they would need to protect the economy through a new stimulus package. Previously, the Bank has suggested it could hike interest rates to prop up the pound and fight inflation, if no-deal caused a sterling crisis and made imports expensive and hard o obtain. But today, Carney said: In the event that there is no deal, the response would not be automatic, it would depend on demand, on supply and where the exchange rate went. Some of us, myself included, have said it is not equally weighted. However, if Britain leaves with a \u2018smooth Brexit\u2019, the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee expect to raise rates in a gradual, limited way. Carney also warned that fears of a no-deal Brexit have risen recently, dragging business investment back and hurting the economy. Financial markets are also anticipating the risk of a disorderly Brexit. Carney said: The path of interest rates, in the markets judgment, is lower because they are ascribing some possibility to no-deal. And in the event of no-deal, that interest rates would be lower than they otherwise would be. The governor reiterated that Britain couldn\u2019t rely on \u201cGatt 24\u201d to insist on tariff-free trade with the EU after a no-deal Brexit. This WTO rule could only be used as part of an agreement between London and Brussels, Carney explained. He also slapped down suggestions that Britain should just get Brexit over with and leave on 31, pointing out that a transition period is crucial to help companies adjust. The Bank also denied that there are too many \u2018zombie companies\u2019, propped up by low interest rates. On world affairs, Carney said that trade war tensions have risen since the Bank issued its latest quarterly inflation report in May (just before Donald Trump announced new tariffs on China). But he remains confident that the Federal Reserve will maintain its independence, despite political pressure from Donald Trump. He also chastised fund managers who invest in illiquid assets but offer their customers instant redemptions, saying they are \u201cbuilt on a lie\u201d. This is a hot issue, since Neil Woodford blocked investors from quitting his equity income fund after a wave of redemptions. Carney warned: \u201cThis is a big deal. You can see something that could be systemic. \u201cThese funds are built on a lie, which is that you can have daily liquidity for assets that fundamentally aren\u2019t liquid. And that leads to an expectation of individuals that it\u2019s not that different to having money in a bank.\u201d Mark Carney finally turns to another issue -- investment funds, which are in the spotlight since Neil Woodford locked down his equity income fund to halt a wave of redemptions. Some funds are \u201cbuilt on a lie\u201d, says Carney severely, the idea that you can have daily liquidity from a fund that holds illiquid assets. That encourages small investors to treat such holdings as \u2018money in the bank\u2019, which you can get instant access to, the governor tells the Treasury committee. Woodford investors now know the truth.... That\u2019s the end of the session. Q: Are low interest rates allowing an army of zombie firms to \u201cstagger on\u201d, endangering financial stability, asks Steve Baker MP. Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders isn\u2019t too worried. He says the number of firms with low profits compared to their interest payments are stable. Yes, there would be more of them if interest rates were higher -- but that could also drive firms to the wall, hurting the wider economy (and creating another wave of zombies)..... Q: Young people are growing up in an era where interest rates have been extremely low for a decade - isn\u2019t that a problem for the future? Umbrella\u2019s don\u2019t cause rain, shoots back Mark Carney (quoting his MPC colleague Gertjan Vlieghe) There are structural reasons why borrowing costs are so low - central banks are providing support to help economies. But yes, there are macro-prudential risks from such low interest rates, Carney says. Q: Back in 2014, you told the committee that monetary policy was at \u201cextraordinary, if not emergency\u201d settings. Would you agree that it still is? Carney does not -- even though interest rates (0.75%) are barely higher than five years ago (0.5%). He argues that \u2018equilibrium\u2019 interest rates (the point where you\u2019re neither stimulating nor strangling the economy) are lower than in 2014. So borrowing costs today are \u2018accommodative\u2019, but not extraordinarily so, the governor insists. Mark Carney warns that \u201ccrystallising\u201d businesses\u2019 concerns over Brexit, by plunging out of the EU without a deal, would cause economic damage. It would lead to some \u2018capital scrapping\u2019 as firms canned equipment, which would also hurt skilled workers, he adds. Back in Westminster, Mark Carney has warned MPs that pay growth will probably slow this summer - having clawed its way up to 3.5% per year. He says the \u2018tightness in the labour market\u2019 has pushed earnings up recently, but Britain has still suffered the worst decade for real pay growth since the 1850s. George Osborne never managed to balance the books as UK chancellor, and he\u2019s not doing much better following his switch to journalism. Osborne\u2019s Evening Standard lost more than \u00a311m before tax last year, but did achieve a 2% rise in revenues in a tough market. Jack Maidment of Mail Online suspects that Mark Carney and Boris Johnson aren\u2019t poles apart on Gatt 24, following the governor\u2019s comments earlier. The issue, though, is whether the EU would go along with Boris\u2019s Plan B, if it didn\u2019t provide a solution to the Irish border question, or settle Britain\u2019s outstanding financial liabilities.... Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe has warned the committee that the international economy is providing less support to the UK than in 2018. Q: Don\u2019t we need to conclude Brexit by Halloween, and end this nightmare, one way or another, asks Brexiteer MP Charlie Elphicke. Mark Carney does his best impression of an Oxbridge don, telling the committee dryly that: There\u2019s a reason that that 40-plus trade deals stuck between advanced economies in the last quarter century have always had a transition from the status quo to the new arrangement.... I would underscore that it is highly desirable to give businesses enough time to adjust to the new reality. Of course, it also matters what that new situation is, adds MPC member Silvana Tenreyro. Worryingly, Mark Carney doesn\u2019t expect the weak business investment to recover soon. Survey data suggests it was weak in the current quarter (April-June). MPC member Michael Saunders chimes in, reiterating that market fears of a no-deal Brexit have risen. The outlook for the economy would be very different now (ie better), if we knew now that we\u2019d see a smooth Brexit, rather than face rolling deadlines and uncertainty, Saunders adds. Mark Carney adds that the housing market has suffered from Brexit uncertainty, as the deadlines for Britain\u2019s departure have been pushed back. [prices in London and the South East have been falling for several months] Q: Isn\u2019t it \u201cunreal\u201d for the BoE to still be assuming a smooth Brexit in its forecasts, then? Carney replies that the markets don\u2019t believe no-deal is the most likely outlook - it\u2019s not the official policy of the government, or either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt. But the Bank is working constantly on its no-deal preparations, in case. Q: Do you think the risk of a no-deal Brexit is growing? Carney turns the question deftly back onto the Treasury committee -- pointing out that it\u2019s the government\u2019s job to plot the path forwards, and parliament\u2019s job to approve it or not. There has been a \u201cnotable increase\u201d in market expectations of no-deal, he adds. This uncertainty is hurting business investment, and hurting the UK\u2019s short-term economic performance. Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe weighs in too -- telling MPs that \u201cwe look to you\u201d. The BoE is only a central bank, after all.... Q: The Westminster Village have been frantically googling \u201cGatt 24\u201d (after Boris Johnson suggested it could be used to guarantee free trade with the EU). You have suggested otherwise.... [Reminder for any MPs baffled by Google: Gatt 24 allows tariff-free trade for up to 10 years while a permanent trade agreement is negotiated]. Mark Carney explains that the UK cannot \u2018unilaterally\u2019 used Gatt 24 - there has to be an agreement in place too. If other WTO members agree that both are sides working towards a free trade deal, then tariff barriers can be lowered. The governor then explains that you can\u2019t have \u2018no deal and Gatt 24\u2019, joking that it may all come down to symantics -- but as a Canadian, he understands that \u2018agreement\u2019 means \u2018deal\u2019 in English. Q: So Gatt 24 can\u2019t apply in a no-deal situation? There has to be an agreement, yes, Carney confirms. Not necessarily the Withdrawal Agreement, but something. Q: Is that Bank of England worried by Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on the Federal Reserve (demanding interest rate cuts)? Mark Carney explains that central bank independence is important. He reassures the committee that \u201cmonetary policy hasn\u2019t been compromised in the UK\u201d (although I do remember some criticism of the BoE by Theresa May in 2016). He adds that he isn\u2019t worried that the Fed will be knocked off course from pursuing low inflation and full employment, saying: I have full confidence that the Federal Reserve will conduct a policy to achieve their dual mandate, and that the timing and extent of any policy changes will be determined by how they think they can achieve that mandate. Q: At the May inflation report, governor, you said that global trade tensions have eased? Does that still hold true? It held true for about 48 hours, Mark Carney grins, before Donald Trump tweeted he was hiking tariffs on Chinese imports. Q: Has the threat to economic growth from a trade war increased? Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe agrees that tensions have increased, with America also threatening Mexico with tariffs and targeting European car sales. Markets are more sensitive to trade developments, Cunliffe says, warning that there are now \u201cmore ingredients\u201d for a full-blown trade war. Q: What advice do you have for your successor, Mr Carney? Carney (who is due to leave the Bank next January) says being governor is an \u201chonour and a privilege\u201d. It\u2019s also a unique role, as the Bank is responsible for financial stability as well as monetary policy. It requires a particular background and set of skills, Carney points out. Q: If Britain\u2019s next prime minister decides that leaving the EU with a deal is impossible, your next inflation report will look very different than the May one.... Carney replies that this isn\u2019t the Plan A of either candidate, but yes, in that scenario the forecasts will change. MPC policymaker Michael Saunders tells the committee that the UK economy could do \u201ca little better\u201d than the Bank forecasts, if Britain leaves the EU smoothly. In that scenario, he argues that interest rate rises will be needed. Q: But what if the Bank of England is wrong, and Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal? We would change our forecasts, Mark Carney replies. He argues that it\u2019s not \u201cautomatic\u201d whether the Bank would raise or lower interest rates, but several policymakers (including Carney) believe some stimulus would be needed. That\u2019s a hint that interest rates could be cut, to protect the economy, in a no-deal situation. Over in parliament, the Treasury Committee is holding a session with the Bank of England over its latest Quarterly Inflation Report. In the hot seats: Dr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England , Sir Jon Cunliffe, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, and monetary policy committee members Silvana Tenreyro and Michael Saunders. Nicky Morgan, chair of the committee, asks why the financial markets haven\u2019t believed the Bank\u2019s claim that interest rates will rise faster than investors think. Carney says the Bank\u2019s forecasts are based on the assumption that Britain will leave the EU smoothly, while the markets are factoring the risk of a disorderly no-deal Brexit. In the Bank\u2019s view -- a smooth Brexit will allow interest rates to rise. As Carney puts is: When we set out the forecast... we\u2019re saying that in the event of a smooth transition to a deal, it would require limited and gradual interest rate increases [to keep inflation on target]. Newsflash: America\u2019s Treasury secretary, Stephen Mnuchin, has told CNBC that the US-China trade deal is \u201c90% complete\u201d. That may bolster confidence ahead of the G20 meeting (although, obviously, the agreement won\u2019t work without that vital last 10%...) Ouch! Rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s have just slashed their forecast for Italian growth this year to virtually zero. S&amp;P now expect Italy to only expand by 0.1%, down from 0.7% previously, extending a long period of weak growth (or worse). The Financial Times\u2019s Daniel Shane says Bitcoin is \u201churtling towards the $13,000 mark\u201d, for the first time since January 2018. He writes: Recent enthusiasm for bitcoin has been stoked by Facebook\u2019s foray into the world of cryptocurrencies, launching its own currency called Libra. The coin is designed as a means of payment and for international money transfers. Analysts are optimistic that Libra will help cryptocurrencies generally gain more mainstream acceptance. World leaders haven\u2019t even set foot in Tokyo yet, but the draft communique from the G20 meeting has already leaked. According to Japanese media, the statement will urge support for free trade to achieve strong global growth. However, this could be queried by the US delegation, who are pushing a more protectionist, \u2018America First\u2019, agenda. My colleague in Beijing, Lily Kuo, reports that few experts expect a substantive agreement at the G20 to end almost a year of trade tensions and months of deteriorating ties between the world\u2019s two largest economies: In the City, clothing retailer Bonmarch\u00e9 has been forced into a screeching u-turn over a takeover offer. Bonmarch\u00e9 had previously rejected a bid from retail billionaire Philip Day, claiming that it undervalued the company. But this morning, it admitted to shareholders that recent trading had been \u201cpoor\u201d, meaning it now recommends accepting Day\u2019s offer! Bonmarch\u00e9 blamed \u201ccontinued weakness in the underlying clothing market, and a lack of seasonal weather\u201d to counteract this trend. So, given the danger that trading doesn\u2019t improve, Day (who owns the Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group) suddenly looks less of a threat and more of a savour. Or as Bonmarch\u00e9\u2019s board put it: Whilst the Board\u2019s view remains that the Offer does not adequately reflect the potential longer term value of the business, the increase in uncertainty that has developed reflecting the trading and financial position of the business during the first quarter of the financial year makes the certainty represented by the Offer potentially more attractive in the short term. Shares in Bonmarch\u00e9 have promptly slumped by 20% to 11.5p, the level of Day\u2019s offer, as hopes of a rip-roaring takeover battle fade. European stock markets are subdued this morning, after America\u2019s top central banker dampened hopes of hefty interest rate cuts. Yesterday, Fed chief Jerome Powell gave a speech in New York in which he appeared to push back against Donald Trump\u2019s demands for lower borrowing costs. Powell declared: The Fed is insulated from short-term political pressures \u2014 what is often referred to as our \u2018independence. Congress chose to insulate the Fed this way because it had seen the damage that often arises when policy bends to short-term political interests. Central banks in major democracies around the world have similar independence. Powell also reiterated that the Fed will act \u201cas appropriate\u201d to sustain America\u2019s economic expansion. But this still left traders disappointed - and worried they\u2019ve been too confident in expecting a Fed rate cut in July. Stephen Innes of Vanguard Markets says Powell: ... walked back some of the market overly zealous dovish inference. This has pushed the main European indices down a little: FTSE 100: Down 8 points of 0.1% at 7,413 German DAX: Down 35 points or 0.3% at 12,192 French CAC: Down 9 points or 0.2% at 5,504 Neil Wilson of Markets.com also reckons Facebook\u2019s move into digital currencies is helping push bitcoin up (as it gives the whole sector more legitimacy). He also believes nervous investors are trying to spread their risk, in case other asset prices tumble. The biggest players are looking at cryptocurrencies afresh and don\u2019t want to miss out. There\u2019s a \u2018haven\u2019 play too as nominal and real yields have retreated sharply, reducing the opportunity cost of holding (or HODLing) bitcoin. And the liquidity injection from central banks has forced a range of assets like gold, bonds, the yen etc, so bitcoin is just being swept along by those macro currents. Whatever the cause, the momentum is powerful right now. Bitcoin has now surged by around 150% in the last two months, from around $5,100 in late April to over $12,700 this morning Marcus Swanepoel, CEO at cryptocurrency exchange Luno, says bitcoin\u2019s in a bull run, for several reasons: The bullish signals for bitcoin have been present for some time, with greater buying and interest from major banks, institutions and groups of specialist buyers adding liquidity to the market. This led to increased speculation and the price rise from April. Then the Facebook announcement of Libra showed to many financial services sectors that altcoins are going mainstream. Finally, as the geopolitical situation remains so uncertain, strategic investors are still looking at Bitcoin and Ethereum as uncorrelated with centralised assets, so provide a quasi safe-haven option. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s another jittery day in the markets, as geopolitical tensions and trade war anxiety give investors plenty to think about. Oil is the big mover this morning - Brent crude has romped to $66.25 per barrel for the first time in almost a month. This follows a report from the American Petroleum Institute showing that US crude stockpiles fell by 7.55 million barrels last week. That bigger-than-expected decline may indicate higher demand than expected. But tensions in the Middle East are also driving oil up. Relations between Washington and Tehran deteriorated further yesterday as Donald Trump threatened to obliterate parts of Iran, after president Rouhani suggested the US leader was \u201cafflicted by a mental disorder\u201d. This sort of \u201cjaw-jaw\u201d antics only increase worries of military action, disrupting supplies. No wonder oil is up 10% since two tankers were attacked in the Gulf of Oman two weeks ago. Investors are also getting nervous about this week\u2019s G20 meeting of world leaders, which kicks off on Friday. Trump is due to meet China\u2019s Xi Jinping on Saturday, for a crucial meeting on trade. American officials say their aim is to restart negotiations, suggesting the two sides could agree not to impose more tariffs while talks are underway. Bloomberg is reporting that the U.S. could suspend the next round of tariffs on an additional $300bn of Chinese imports. But nothing\u2019s guaranteed. And in such turbulent times, some traders are turning to cryptocurrencies for protection. Bitcoin has continued its recent strong rally, hurtling through the $12,000 mark for the first time in 15 months today. It\u2019s currently up 8.4%, or $986, at $12,737. And with Facebook\u2019s new Libra currency getting plenty of attention, some analysts are predicting that digital coins will keep climbing. Also coming up today Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is being quizzed by MPs on the Treasury committee. Officially it\u2019s about the Bank\u2019s last quarterly inflation report, but Brexit and trade rules may also come up too (especially as Carney shot down Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit idea last week). Plus, new US durable goods and trade data will show if America\u2019s economy is suffering from the trade dispute with China. The agenda 10.15am BST: Treasury committee hearing with the Bank of England 1.30pm BST: US durable goods orders for May 1.30pm BST: US trade goods for May"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
