Win the game.\" The orders were originally scribbled for Mansfield's visit last week but Macclesfield's players can expect similar pre-match instructions tomorrow before West Ham's sprightly young things step into the unknown. \"They won't fancy it, the Hammers,\" beamed Keen. \"They won't fancy it one bit.\" He should know. Having started out as an apprentice cleaning Trevor Brooking's boots at the Boleyn Ground, the 34-year-old has been waiting nine years for the chance to renew acquaintances with the club for whom he played 279 times, mostly as a long-haired winger bustling up and down the right. After a brief spell earlier this season as player-manager, which ended with the players petitioning the board to keep him in the job full-time, Macclesfield's player-coach could find himself in central midfield tomorrow in direct opposition to Joe Cole, one of the modern-day graduates of West Ham's academy. \"I suppose I could always kick him, if I can get near him,\" he said with a smile. \"When the draw was made I sat there for a minute taking it in. To think that West Ham are going to play here. We'll have a right go.\" As it is, winning is not everything. Lured by the prospect of a Cup shock, the BBC will broadcast the fixture live, leaving the Silkmen some \u00a3265,000 better off. The Third Division side achieved Football League status only four years ago and boast players on as little as \u00a3250 a week with Danny Adams, a \u00a315,000 buy from Altrincham, currently their most expensive recruit. Eighteen months ago the left-back was a postman. \"The television money alone will keep this club going for two years,\" said Keen. \"Our chief executive admitted he'd rather we drew a massive team, were selected for the telly and lost than got through and were not on the box. \"The Premiership is a different world. I played in the top division for West Ham but the top players now are modern-day icons. They're stars. We've got four or five here who are Manchester United fanatics and four or five who are City. I say to them: 'Look at what you could earn and the prestige you could gain if you work hard.' But they see themselves as different. It's no surprise: \u00a3265,000, what's that? That's five weeks' wages for someone at United but it's the lifeblood for this club.\" With Town expecting their biggest crowd since City won a Second Division fixture at Moss Rose three seasons ago, the television company has also supplied covers to ensure the pitch survives the cold snap. But just in case the club has paid out a \u00a312,000 premium to protect against financial loss should the match be postponed. \"My first manager at Upton Park, John Lyall, told me that you make lots of acquaintances in football but few good friends,\" said Keen. \"I made two at West Ham in Steve Potts and Paul Goddard [the current assistant manager]. They both rang me when the draw was made and Godders said: 'I suppose your pitch is in a right state.' \"Most people perceive the Third Division to be full of up-and-under football. These days there are more footballing teams, and consequently fewer shocks, though the standard of pitches is a big factor. Remember that Ronnie Radford goal [for Hereford against Newcastle]? That pitch was a shocker. Ours is excellent.\" The visitors can take heart from that. Macclesfield may be 88th in the League, their thin cushion from the bottom gleaned during a recent seven-match unbeaten run under the new manager David Moss - \"he's proved to be the right appointment,\" Keen admits - but West Ham have a shocking recent record of Cup exits. The 90s saw ignominious defeats to Wrexham, Swansea and Tranmere, and Aldershot and Farnborough both took the Londoners to replays. \"When Lou Macari was manager, we lost at Torquay in the third round in 1990,\" recalled Keen, who had his car stolen that weekend to add insult to injury. \"It was horrible, humiliating. But the biggest disappointment I had was our semi-final defeat in 1991. Keith Hackett sent Tony Gale off, we lost 4-0 to Forest and I never got a sniff of Wembley again.\" Keen's West Ham career featured two promotions and two relegations, though he signed off on a high in 1993 as Billy Bonds' side burst back into the top flight at the first attempt. Yet, with the club's bond scheme bubbling away disconcertingly in the background, the midfielder found himself out of contract and unimpressed with the terms offered at Upton Park. \"It was a massive kick in the teeth,\" he said. \"Wolves came in and made me feel very wanted, part of their new revolution. It was a horrible decision to have to make because I loved West Ham. I was nearly in tears when I told Billy Bonds that I was leaving. My kids ask me if I played in the Premiership and I have to tell them I did play in the old First Division. They just look at me blankly and ask: 'The what?'\" The chance to feature in the top flight never came again, with Wolves still revolving and Stoke City, with whom he played for six years, slipping into the Second Division. His current Macclesfield contract expires next summer and Keen, about to complete his Grade A coaching badge, would contemplate a move to his native south-east. \"For the moment I've only got this game on my mind,\" he said. \"The last few weeks have been agony. I was one booking away from a suspension and played at Shrewsbury on the Friday before Christmas knowing that, if I got a yellow, I'd miss the West Ham game. That was scary; this could be special.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
