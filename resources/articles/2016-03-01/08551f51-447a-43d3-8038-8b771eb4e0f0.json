Their previous seven games had yielded a single point. Rovers had taken one from nine. A draw seemed the only solution to League One\u2019s battle of the new year boobies but in the 93rd minute The Posh stole a 2-1 victory against the rush of play, tipping Rovers into the relegation places. Westley lauded his players\u2019 character. Darren Ferguson, his opposite number and twice of Peterborough, called it \u201ca devastating defeat\u201d, adding: \u201cI would have been disappointed if we had drawn. I have to stay strong for my players and I can\u2019t really criticise them.\u201d The match was loaded with negative statistics. The clubs filled the bottom two places of the six- and 10-match form tables. Neither has won at home this year \u2013 so much for the fortress image of the Keepmoat. And it all looked so promising at the turn of the year after both managers, new to their clubs after ropy starts under others, had raised their fortunes. After away wins on 2 January Peterborough lay sixth and Rovers, 23rd when Ferguson was installed in mid-October, were 11th. Westley referred to \u201ca horrible vein of form\u201d, Ferguson to \u201ca horrendous run\u201d. Rovers\u2019 rock bottom is still elusive. Fortunately both clubs\u2019 fans are familiar with such fluctuations. Four seasons ago they met in the Championship. Westley believes his current group of players will take The Posh back there, while sticking to the owner Darragh MacAnthony\u2019s \u201cpassion for attacking football\u201d. Stability is Westley\u2019s new promise after admitting to too much tinkering. He followed that with only five changes on Saturday. Sustainability is Rovers\u2019 watchword. Their chief executive, Gavin Baldwin, wrote of \u201cthe manager\u2019s exciting plans as he looks to build his own squad with their own Doncaster Rovers DNA, philosophy and identity from youth to the first team\u201d. The philosophy is inclusive. \u201cWe have to recognise that without supporters the club is nothing,\u201d Baldwin added. He did not say what it is with them but reduced ticket prices led to above-average home numbers, boosted by a strong away contingent. For a match between near dedicated losers it had a cracking atmosphere. Baldwin described the run-in as \u201c10 cup finals\u201d and said: \u201cEveryone at the club is now working to find a way of winning games and winning games quickly.\u201d Rovers scored inside five minutes, which was a bit too quick to start defending. The giant Ricardo Santos tried to shepherd the ball over the byline, Andy Williams robbed him and James Coppinger, 35, smacked home the cross. As the game hurtled from frantic to frenetic Coppinger was a model of cool and vision. He has made almost 500 Rovers appearances. It took Peterborough the rest of the half to equalise. Marcus Maddison, 22 and also wide on the right, picked out Aaron Williams for an even easier conversion. Maddison, not the only Newcastle discard questioning that club\u2019s judgment, was a Ferguson signing and constant threat. It was his late centre that Williams headed against a post before Santos found redemption. Doncaster fans rose for the exits with a collective shrug of familiarity. Heaven knows what Maurice Setters, a former Rovers manager, would have made of the fuchsia shirts (Posh, of course) and fluorescent ballet boots but he would have loved the robust spirit of the game. Remarkably Peterborough are now nearer the play-offs than relegation. Doncaster face Colchester then Blackpool, fellow strugglers. For them it is as it was \u2013 desperate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
