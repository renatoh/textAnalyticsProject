Freddie Gray died from a \u201csignificant spinal injury\u201d, police confirmed on Monday, while claiming it remained unknown how he was hurt. Chiefs said Gray appeared to have been injured while locked alone in a compartment of their transportation wagon. \u201cWhen Mr Gray was put in that van, he could talk, he was upset. And when he was taken out of that van, he could not talk and he could not breathe,\u201d deputy police commissioner Jerry Rodriguez said at a press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that what happened happened inside the van,\u201d said mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any procedure that would have an officer riding in the back of the van with the suspect.\u201d Rodriguez said all officers involved who had been interviewed had denied using force against Gray. A criminal inquiry has been opened into Gray\u2019s death. City officials said the investigation would be completed by Friday 1 May and then handed to state prosecutors, who would decide whether or not to bring criminal charges. Providing the most detailed timeline of events surrounding Gray\u2019s arrest and detention on 12 April, senior city officials revealed he had asked officers for an asthma inhaler two minutes after he was apprehended, before he was placed inside the police van. Yet the van made two stops before medical assistance was radioed for, the officials said. During the second stop, another prisoner from a separate incident was placed inside the van in a compartment walled off from Gray. Rodriguez told reporters before this second stop, which occurred about 13 minutes after Gray was placed in the van, the driver had requested an additional unit to check on Gray, who had been placed in leg irons during the first stop after \u201cacting irate in the back\u201d. The 25-year-old eventually received medical attention half an hour after the police van departed, according to the police timeline of events. Gray died on Sunday, a week after being chased and arrested by officers at 8.39 am. His family say he lapsed into a coma after his spine was \u201c80% severed\u201d at his neck and his voice box was injured. Police said an autopsy was completed on Monday and confirmed the spinal injury led to Gray\u2019s death. During Monday\u2019s press conference Rodriguez said Gray was arrested after a lieutenant had made \u201ceye contact\u201d with two individuals \u2013 one of whom was Gray \u2013 and then Gray fled on foot. Rawlings-Blake stressed that city officials appreciated that it was not an offence to \u201crun away\u201d. A court filing from the day of Gray\u2019s arrest showed he was charged with illegally carrying a knife, which an officer said was discovered inside one of Gray\u2019s pockets. However Rawlings-Blake said: \u201cWe know that having a knife is not necessarily a crime, not necessarily a probable cause to search someone.\u201d Billy Murphy Jr, an attorney for Gray\u2019s family, said earlier on Monday the knife charge did not explain why Gray was chased and searched. \u201cHow did they have x-ray vision or any knowledge of that?\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIf you arrest a man illegally the evidence you find afterwards is not admissible. There\u2019s always the temptation \u2013 because you\u2019re dealing with human beings \u2013 that they\u2019re going to cover this up in a way that makes them look faultless.\u201d Rodriguez confirmed Gray \u201cgave up without the use of force\u201d and while one officer unholstered his Taser, he did not deploy it during the arrest. Footage recorded by a nearby city surveillance camera, which was played at Monday\u2019s press conference, did not appear to shed light on what happened. Cellphone video of Gray\u2019s arrest released last week showed him being dragged into the police van by officers. While he was shouting in apparent pain and moving his head, at least one of his legs appeared limp. The video did not show his initial treatment by police. Rawlings-Blake said there was no footage recorded inside the van. Police said the other prisoner in the back of the van had been interviewed. An \u201cindependent review board\u201d is to be convened by police chiefs to look into the incident and report back on whether procedures were followed. An account of the incident in the court filing, written by an officer Garrett Miller, said that after being \u201carrested without force or incident,\u201d during his transportation to the police\u2019s western district headquarters Gray \u201csuffered a medical emergency and was immediately transported to Shock Trauma via medic.\u201d Rawlings-Blake, speaking alongside Baltimore police commissioner Anthony Batts, called for calm among city residents who have protested the death and called for an indictment of the officers responsible. \u201cWe are a community on edge,\u201d said Batts. \u201cI understand the community\u2019s frustration. I understand because I am frustrated,\u201d Rawlings-Blake said. \u201cI\u2019m angry that we are here again, that we have had to tell another mother that her child is dead.\u201d However Rodriguez said: \u201cThis is not Ferguson,\u201d referring to the Missouri town where unrest followed the fatal police shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old last August. \u201cThis is a city where we work very hard with the current administration to enter into dialogue with the community,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
