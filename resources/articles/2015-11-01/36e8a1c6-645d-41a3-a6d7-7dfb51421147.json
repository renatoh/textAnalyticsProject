I envisioned her as slightly gothic, other-worldly, with a dreamy gaze and a lofty air. But when we meet in a Sydney cafe \u2013 that unruly dark hair and Mona Lisa smile now in the flesh and sitting by a table of empty coffee cups \u2013 the Brisbane-based writer proves open, engaging and a fast talker; hardly the misty-eyed mystic you\u2019d assume was responsible for a post-apocalyptic world of telepathic teenagers and talking animals. Like so many who grew up reading the Obernewtyn Chronicles, I can\u2019t remember, precisely, how the books entered my life. I mention recently picking up my yellowing 1993 copy of the first book from the shelf and the cover promptly falling away. It made me gasp to see it had aged so much. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely because people bring them to me to sign sometimes,\u201d Carmody says. \u201cThey always apologise for a beaten up old book, and I\u2019m just really touched.\u201d (I confess my copy is signed and that we\u2019d first before at a fan event, held at my local children\u2019s bookstore a few years ago.) The series debut, Obernewtyn, was first published in 1987, and now thousands of pages of high-adventure, tense battle scenes and sea-swept romance later Carmody has released the seventh and final book, the longest yet at 1,120 pages. Readers have followed the plucky, young orphan Elspeth Gordie as she banded together with other \u201cTalented Misfits\u201d to form a community of young people with telepathic powers, before embarking on a quest to destroy a secret cache of potentially cataclysmic weapons. With each book the Obernewtyn world map has expanded like unlocked doors to ever more rooms. Has it been difficult adhering each new title to the increasingly complicated internal logic? \u201cI don\u2019t try to control everything because I wouldn\u2019t have ever begun,\u201d she says. Instead the story has unfolded in an \u201corganic, totally chaotic way\u201d through the eyes of Elspeth. Her understanding of the world and her prejudices shift, as do social attitudes. Misinformation clings like mist to the entire story. Sometimes Elspeth builds \u201cincredible plans\u201d over an entire book based on an assumption that\u2019s incorrect, she says. I ask if she is familiar with George RR Martin\u2019s metaphor that divides writers into architects and gardeners. The former come to the writing table armed with hand drawn maps, charts and complex genealogies, but Carmody puts herself in the latter camp: \u201cI chuck a handful of seeds into the weeds and see what starts to grow ... I go out and look and see there\u2019s a blue flower over there, so I start to prune around it.\u201d She has introduced characters with little more than a strong hunch regarding what role they will play, such as the red-haired street urchin Dragon, while in other cases discovered the seeds of potential storylines had already been planted. \u201cYou work so much in your subconscious when you write. Sometimes you write something and think \u2018oh my god, I should have realised that\u2019. And you go back to put it in earlier and it was already there.\u201d Carmody has Elspeth-like \u201cmoss-green coloured eyes\u201d and while her hair is now tinted red, its natural colour is a familiar black. She says her daughter Adelaide accused her of modelling Elspeth on herself, something Carmody vigorously denied. Eventually she conceded: perhaps the character was an \u201cidealised version\u201d of herself when she began writing the first book, aged just 14. Two of her cats, Hurricane and Mitya, have been blind in one eye like Elspeth\u2019s one-eyed feline companion Maruman. She mentions her father, who died in a car accident the same year she began writing, also had \u201ca piece of cloud across his eye\u201d. Growing up in the Victorian town of Wangaratta, Carmody says her mother worked night shifts and fearing for the safety of her eight children, forbade them from playing on the street. \u201cWe were quite isolated, but we didn\u2019t feel it because there were eight of us.\u201d They didn\u2019t own a television or many books, so as the eldest sibling Carmody would architect wild, story games, describing herself as a kind of \u201cdemonic Steven Spielberg\u201d. Writing became a space in which to tackle the questions that troubled her. \u201cI began with \u2018why did a drunk driver get away with killing my dad? Why is my mum scared the welfare is going to get us? Why does that teacher pick on me at school? Why do those kids want to beat me up?\u2019\u201d It is not hard to see why a teenage Carmody named the heroes of her books \u201cmisfits\u201d. She still loves seeing fans turn up wearing \u201cI am a misfit\u201d T-shirts. Challenging oppression is a central theme of the Obernewtyn Chronicles, embodied not only by the telepathic community and their search for acceptance but by concurrent struggles from the animals, rebels, gypsies and Redlanders, that Carmody calls \u201ca constant striving to some kind of amalgamation\u201d. \u201cElspeth\u2019s question is how to exist in the world, to be what she is and to find people who would allow her to be what she is. I think it\u2019s everybody\u2019s question to find a place in the world and to find your tribe, but the world itself has to find a way to let groups of people exist with one another.\u201d Some of the powers possessed by the characters \u2013 the ability to enter people\u2019s minds, travel in their dreams and talk to animals \u2013 are a kind of fantastical exercise in extreme empathy. Carmody says there is \u201cvery rarely evil people\u201d, rather \u201ccomplex situations that could be understood better if people just had a will to try and understand it.\u201d Every Obernewtyn book is a blend of high-octane action and long passages of Elspeth\u2019s internal monologue as she analyses, schemes and struggles with her feelings (\u201cgnawing\u201d, as Maruman calls it). It is as much this intimate journalling of her inner life \u2013 this freedom fighter who maintains her humanity in the face of slavery, religious fanaticism, torture, greed, environmental destruction and the tidal waves of fate; this fearless natural born leader who is reluctant to use violence or aggression; this woman who discovers community, friendship and love propel her forward just as much as they hold her back \u2013 that distinguishes the books from other young adult series. In many ways she is the precursor to today\u2019s heroine du jour, Katniss Everdeen of The Hunger Games. Carmody calls the series a \u201cgreat story, racily written\u201d but says it was obvious writer Suzanne Collins wasn\u2019t given enough time to develop. \u201cI think many writers could have written better books if they were given a bit more time, if they would just stop pumping out the sausage machine and slow down the process. Some of those writers who bring out an OK book could have brought out something brilliant.\u201d The breaks between Obernewtyn chapters, during which Carmody would write other books, has meant fans of the series have waited nearly 30 years to discover the fate of Elspeth and her clue-hunting quest to save the planet. \u201cThere were times where her search and mine to finish the book was just this exhausting process of getting to the top of Everest.\u201d Ending such a lengthy and much-loved saga, which has sold 400,000 copies, to the satisfaction of fans is no small thing. She has been \u201cvery conscious\u201d of how long readers have waited and at one point was \u201cfreaked out by it\u201d. Her Facebook page has become the front lawn upon which fans turn up to badger the author regarding plot-lines. \u201cSomeone posted on my Facebook page the other day: there are some deal-breakers here; you\u2019d better answer these questions; don\u2019t you dare do this; please let Elspeth and Rushton survive, please, please, don\u2019t kill one of them.\u201d Carmody admits she was always concerned she might \u201cdrop dead\u201d one day (and there was never a contingency plan for the series if she did). \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many letters I\u2019ve got from people saying \u2018please don\u2019t die\u2019. At different points I was too scared to post on Facebook because people would come on and say \u2018aren\u2019t you meant to be working?\u2019\u201d To the more aggressive fans she would point them to a piece by Neil Gaiman containing the memorable line: \u201cGeorge RR Martin is not your bitch.\u201d Although Carmody is adamant this is the end of the Obernewtyn Chronicles she says there is a \u201cstrong chance\u201d of a television adaption. She is also writing a trio of prequel spinoffs called the Beforetime Chronicles, that will hone in on the stories of Cassandra and Hannah, adding, \u201cI have plenty of doors back in [to the story] if I want to take it.\u201d In writing the final chapter of such a long-running series did she feel a sense of loss? \u201cNot a loss, I think you feel a kind of emptiness. You feel emptied out in a good way. I felt very light.\u201d Carmody wrote The Red Queen while staying at a friend\u2019s place and says when she finished writing cleaned up the house, packed her bag and by dusk had set off for the four hour return commute, on two busses and a train ride. \u201cI arrived home in the night and it felt very symbolic, that journey. It was a lovely feeling of blissful separation, of floating away into a future.\u201d The Red Queen is out through Penguin"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
