Barbados-born but now central to England\u2019s World Cup campaign after qualifying for selection via his British passport and residency, Archer\u2019s desire to remove any emotional significance from the game in Southampton on Friday is understandable. But with five Bajans in the opposing squad \u2013 Jason Holder, Shai Hope, Carlos Brathwaite, Ashley Nurse and Kemar Roach \u2013 and former West Indies Under\u201119s teammates in Shimron Hetmyer and Nicholas Pooran, familiarity does at least offer insight. \u201cIt\u2019s just another game of cricket, same as today, same as the last game,\u201d Archer told BBC Sport after his three wickets helped to wrap up a one\u2011sided 106-run victory against Bangladesh in Cardiff on Friday. \u201cI know them pretty good. I played with a few of the guys in under-19s, so it will be good to actually play against them this time. I\u2019ll be able to share some knowledge but I do that whenever we play. \u201cEven against Bangladesh I played with and against guys in the BPL and I guess I\u2019ll share some knowledge when we play India and Australia. It\u2019s not just the West Indies; I\u2019ve got a pretty good knowledge of most of the prominent batters.\u201d Archer, who will have family at the ground on Friday, certainly has his tail up again. Against Bangladesh he averaged 90.6mph in his opening spell, bowled a miserly, awkward line throughout and, in doing so, shrugged off a leaky showing in the defeat by Pakistan at Trent Bridge. The 24-year-old felt he did little different from one game to the next and insisted he was more concerned with \u201cbowling well\u201d than pace alone. One does feed into the other and in Mark Wood, who sent down the fastest ball of the competition so far when clocked at 95.6mph, he has a fellow quick pushing him on. Archer joked that he is faster than Wood and felt the big screen in Cardiff showed a touch of bias by showing only the latter\u2019s speeds. He is fully aware of the physical threat they offer as a pairing, having roughed up the dangerous Tamim Iqbal himself and then seen Wood bounce him out. \u201cI think you\u2019ve seen someone got hit today twice,\u201d Archer said. \u201cIf Iget hit once I don\u2019t want to be thereany more really. Imagine getting hit twice.\u201d For all this talk of intimidation Archer is a gentle but confident character off the field. When asked if he ever doubted whether he could make the transition from Sussex and various global Twenty20 leagues to the international stage, the reply was unequivocal. \u201cNah, I never doubted myself,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re doubting yourself I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready and probably shouldn\u2019t be here. I didn\u2019t really notice the step up. I\u2019ve been playing competitive cricket for the last few years against the same guys really so it doesn\u2019t really change anything. The only thing that changes is your uniform.\u201d England\u2019s players, back to winning ways once again, have time off at home before returning to training on Wednesday. Their one fitness doubt surrounds Jos Buttler, who sustained a hip injury when striking a six in England\u2019s 386 for six and did not keep wicket in the second innings. The team management continue to be confident about his chances. The nature of the knock means Buttler will either take the gloves or miss out altogether, with the captain, Eoin Morgan, stating that haring around in the outfield carries greater risk than standing behind the stumps."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
