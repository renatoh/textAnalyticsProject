Firms including Aviva, RSA, Hiscox and Direct Line announced on Wednesday they were cancelling their dividends for 2019 and would not consider further payouts until the end of the year. This has meant cancelling about \u00a31.3bn in collective shareholder payments, including a \u00a3839.4m dividend from Aviva that was due in June 2020. The majority of the UK\u2019s largest insurers have heeded guidance by the Bank, which last month fired a warning shot at the industry over planned payouts, after pushing UK banks to do the same. The move will increase the pressure on Legal &amp; General to follow suit, after it pledged to pay \u00a3754m to investors, regardless of the regulator\u2019s guidance. Other UK-headquartered insurers including Phoenix Group, Admiral and Prudential have so far stayed silent on the issue. Prudential may try to avoid heeding the Bank\u2019s guidance, as it is regulated in Hong Kong where the bulk of its operations are based. However, Russ Mould, an investment director at AJ Bell, said Prudential may still bow to public pressure. \u201cIn general, there\u2019s some public and political perception that companies need to be more careful with their cash and make sure they can withstand more difficult times ahead. \u201cIt seems likely Legal &amp; General, looking more and more the outlier, will have to follow suit.\u201d The Bank\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority, which is in charge of financial stability in the UK, said it welcomed the decision from some insurers to pause dividends, given the economic uncertainty. It said: \u201cWhen insurers are considering whether or not to proceed with any dividend payments, their boards should pay close attention to the need to protect policyholders and maintain safety and soundness. Decisions regarding capital or significant risk management issues need to be informed by a range of scenarios, including very severe ones.\u201d William Ryder, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that while insurers such as RSA and Direct Line would be well-capitalised in normal circumstances, \u201cthe coming months are not going to be normal\u201d. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s worth remembering that the bailout of American insurer AIG was a key moment in the 2008 financial crisis, and we can\u2019t risk a loss of confidence in the industry now. We understand, therefore, why the regulator isn\u2019t comfortable leaving it to management to assess their capacity to pay a dividend.\u201d Admiral, Phoenix and Prudential declined to comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
