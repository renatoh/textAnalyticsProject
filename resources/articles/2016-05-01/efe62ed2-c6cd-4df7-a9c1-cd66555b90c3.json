The billionaire, who secured the backing of Republican voters on a staunchly anti-immigration platform, said that his support for the UK leaving the EU was a personal belief and not a \u201crecommendation\u201d. \u201cI think the migration has been a horrible thing for Europe,\u201d Trump told Fox News late on Thursday. \u201cA lot of that was pushed by the EU. I would say that they\u2019re better off without it, personally, but I\u2019m not making that as a recommendation. Just my feeling.\u201d \u201cI know Great Britain very well,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cI know, you know, the country very well. I have a lot of investments there. I would say that they\u2019re better off without it. But I want them to make their own decision.\u201d The Republican frontrunner, who benefited this week from his last two rivals dropping out of the race, had previously resisted commenting on whether Britain should vote to leave the EU in its referendum next month. Earlier this week, Trump criticized Barack Obama for coming out against Brexit, telling the Daily Mail the current incumbent of the White House should be \u201cmore neutral\u201d on the subject. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was a good thing for him to do it,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI would say that I\u2019m not going to give Britain any advice, but I know there are a lot of people that are very, very much against being in the EU.\u201d In March, Trump said he suspected Britain may leave the EU because \u201cthey\u2019re having a lot of problems\u201d but stressed he did not want to intervene. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make a comment about the UK leaving but I think they may leave based on \u2013 I\u2019m there a lot, I have a lot of investments in the UK, and I will tell you that I think they may leave based on everything I\u2019m hearing,\u201d he said at the time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
