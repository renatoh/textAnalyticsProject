Yes, the Beatles: the band that split up four decades ago and yet remain the most famous pop group in the world. On 9 September, Liverpool's best-loved export will surely once again be top of the charts, with the release of their digitally remastered albums. On the very same day, there will be the launch of \"The Beatles: Rock Band\" \u2013 an interactive video game that, the blurb promises, enables you to \"join John, Paul, George, and Ringo onstage at legendary shows... in the recording studio, and in dreamscapes that bring their psychedelic imagery to life\". Between those two options, it is safe to say that Santa Claus is going to find this Christmas fairly straightforward. Leaving aside the state-of-the-art technical wondrousness (\"a Pro Tools workstation operating at 24-bit 192kHz resolution via a Prism A-D converter\": frighteningly, there are people who actually understand this stuff) of the remastered albums, and their release is not, in business terms, that innovative. From the CD boom of the 1980s onwards, music consumers are well-used to upgrading their old and badly scratched favourites. And, as anyone who has ever puzzled over the Peter Blake cover for Sgt Pepper can attest, the Beatles pioneered the elevation of the album from longplaying collection of A- and B-sides to revered artefact. Which is why the video game is such a telling indicator of where pop music \u2013 and many other industries \u2013 is headed. The current predicament of the pop industry can be summed up in a Lennon/McCartney lyric: \"You never give me your money/ you only give me your funny paper.\" Music sales are at their lowest level in over 20 years, and record companies are scrabbling around for some way to staunch the haemorrhage of revenue. CD sales are plunging and are not being offset by paid-for downloads. Whether this is all the result of illegal file-sharing is not as settled as argument as Peter Mandelson's proposal this week to cut down on internet piracy suggests. Those who remember the home-taping-is-killing-music crusades of a couple of decades ago argue that the most fervent downloaders of music are usually those most likely to buy the most albums. There is some evidence to back this up, although sharing MP3s is to dubbing tapes what Formula One is to cycling: faster and much, much more dangerous. Regardless of the causes, the music industry is now turning to other ways to make money, whether that be live performance or the licensing of music to TV and video games. As the economists Alan Krueger and Marie Connolly pointed out in their seminal 2005 paper Rockonomics, the structure of most recording contracts is so weighted against musicians that only the very top artists make any actual money from their albums \u2013 for the rest, concert ticket sales have long been far more important. But for the labels, the recordings have always been a vital source of cash \u2013 without it, they have to find other ways to keep in business. And other industries are looking very carefully (and nervously) at how the records labels are faring. In the world of books, the literary festival and other forms of author performance are becoming a vital way to lift stable sales. And in these pages just a couple of weeks ago, the seasoned newspaper editor Simon Jenkins provocatively argued that his colleagues should forget about the printing presses and think about seminars and debates instead. Perhaps those industries that have always been about artefacts \u2013 records, periodicals and books \u2013 will end up thinking more about performances. Perhaps some of this is inevitable, but it does have its melancholy aspects too. Those special moments when people queued around the block for the latest album or shelled out in droves for that breaking news hot off the press may become a thing of the past."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
