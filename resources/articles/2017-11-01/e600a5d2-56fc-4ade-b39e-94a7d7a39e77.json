To play away from home and score four goals, we could have scored seven, eight; this was very, very good.\u201d Two first-half goals from Ashley Young set up the win, the second a sublime free-kick from 25 yards. Mourinho had been caught by the TV cameras looking baffled in the aftermath. \u201cI was surprised that Paul [Pogba] gave him permission,\u201d he said. \u201cI was not surprised with his shot. He\u2019s quite good. In training his percentages are high.\u201d Watford\u2019s rally came after Nemanja Matic was forced to leave the pitch with a muscular injury (\u201cFor Matic to tell me he wants to be replaced, he does not do that if it is nothing important,\u201d Mourinho said), after which United\u2019s defence was stretched at times. \u201cThey came with everything, they had no problems, they gave us a couple of minutes of real pressure, where we felt anything could happen. This is football.\u201d \u201cWhat we needed to do was go back to our defensive stability, which we lost when Matic had to come out. But the important thing is the three points\u201d Jesse Lingard capped the win with a lovely solo goal but again there was effort but no edge from Romelu Lukaku. \u201cLukaku needs a big contract with a new boots company; they need to pay him lots of money so that he can start scoring again,\u201d Mourinho joked. \u201cHe is such an amazing player for the team, such a good professional. He works so hard.\u201d For Marco Silva this was a match his team lost on \u201cdetails\u201d, with Watford\u2019s manager also suggesting Marcos Rojo should have received a second yellow card towards the end. \u201cWe started very well the first 20 minutes,\u201d Silva said. \u201cI told my players it\u2019s not our image to make a lot of mistakes; we need to do everything different. Forget the result and play our game and we did different in the second half. When we scored near the end for me that looked like a yellow card for Marcos Rojo and 11 versus 10 at that point would have been difficult. That for me looked fair at that moment.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
