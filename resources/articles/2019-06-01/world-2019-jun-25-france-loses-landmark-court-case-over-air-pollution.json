In the first case of its kind, Farida, 52, and her 16-year-old daughter, whose full names were not released by the court, sued the French state over the impact of living near Paris\u2019s traffic-choked ringroad in Saint-Ouen. She had told an association fighting for clean air: \u201cFor years I had respiratory infections.\u201d What began as nasal and throat infections got gradually worse. \u201cI repeatedly had bronchitis. Doctors gave me antibiotics but it wasn\u2019t helping,\u201d she said. \u201cThree years ago I was sent to a lung specialist who said my problems were linked to air pollution. He advised me to move. My daughter had had bronchitis as a baby then asthma while growing up.\u201d The woman and her daughter eventually moved to Orl\u00e9ans and the symptoms cleared up. The case, before the administrative court in Montreuil outside Paris, was the first brought by individuals against the French state over health problems caused by air pollution. It was backed by several environmental groups. The court said in its written verdict: \u201cThe state committed a fault by taking insufficient measures concerning the quality of air.\u201d It said that between 2012 and 2016 the state failed to take measures needed to reduce concentrations of certain polluting gases exceeding the limits. \u201cFor victims of pollution, this is a first,\u201d said the women\u2019s lawyer, Francois Lafforgue. \u201cFrom now, the state will have to take effective measures in the fight against pollution.\u201d But the court rejected the women\u2019s demand for \u20ac160,000 (\u00a3143,000) in damages, saying it could not find a direct link between their health problems and the state\u2019s failings. The court ruling said the state had failed to fulfil its air protection plan intended to counter pollution. Nadir Sa\u00effi, the vice-president of the organisation Ecology without Borders, told Le Monde: \u201cThis is a historic judgment for the 67,000 French people who die prematurely each year due to air pollution. Today victims of pollution, like victims of pesticide, should not be afraid to go to court to defend their health.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
