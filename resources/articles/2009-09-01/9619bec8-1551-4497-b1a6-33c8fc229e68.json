It suggested that Ummah had become the conduit for a Muslim extremist hit list of prominent Jewish figures. We now know, thanks to sharp work by bloggers Tim Ireland and Richard Bartholemew, that the whole thing was a ruse by Glen Jenvey, a self-styled terrorism expert. He placed the hit-list email on Ummah, fed the story to the Sun via a news agency, and was then quoted expressing horror about the evil plot. Slick. But not slick enough. Last week we raised the question of Patrick Mercer, who chairs the parliamentary counterterrorism subcommittee, and had endorsed Jenvey as a man \"who needs to be listened to\". The MP strongly condemned Jenvey's deception, which occurred in January. \"My office certainly received information from him but never worked with him,\" he said. And that's fine with us. But not with Mr Ireland's site, Bloggerheads, for now it publishes an email sent by a Mercer aide to the People newspaper. \"I have been in touch with Mr Jenvey about a number of things, but most of all the following, which in my view would combine well to make a very good Sunday story,\" it says. All quite collegiate then, but it comes down to the definition of \"working\" together, say sources close to the MP. Mercer himself had no further dealings with Jenvey, though his officials occasionally received information from him. Sometimes it checked out. Sometimes not. Two months after doubts were raised about Jenvey's dodgy activities, the link between the fabricator and Mercer's aides had yet to be broken. A shadowy world, this counterterrorism. Big news; someone is keen to spend time with Alistair Darling. They are constituents. The problem is that he is less keen to spend time with them. This is why hundreds of posters appeared across his Edinburgh constituency yesterday with the headline \"Wanted\", reflecting his refusal to attend a meeting of locals worried about the global economy ahead of his appearance at the G20. It doesn't help that Douglas Alexander has agreed to attend the equivalent meeting in his constituency. Trust him to make things worse. Full steam ahead to Labour in Brighton, and many seeking sustenance will look to the union Unite, which traditionally throws a helluva party. But the wind is cold and money's tight, so this year they are trying to keep costs down. Invites have not been sent in the usual way. Instead MPs who've received an email from Charlie Whelan, Unite's political director, are asked to take their passes to an office at conference to get their personalised invite. And who has been invited among the 112 Unite MPs and 20 peers? Who hasn't? Whose nose will be pressed against the window? This is the worry. We all need to belong. The Lib Dems are gone but not forgotten, and of particular note is their grand vision for Whitehall, unveiled this week. Out would go the Department for Business. Redundancy, then, for Vicky Pryce, its chief economist, who happens to be married to Chris Huhne, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman. But it's OK. She'd understand. The things they say. This from Jude Law. \"I was intrigued by the role. Getting to the heart of a character playing somebody who is a character getting to the heart of trying to get to the heart of his own character.\" This from Ruth Reed, the new president of the Royal Institute of British Architects. \"We value our landscapes very highly in this country, and the green belt is a concrete example of that.\" Sometimes they'll spew poison and no one cares; and so it is in France where, despite the rightwing rantings of Brigitte Bardot, many are preparing to celebrate her 75th birthday on Monday. Simultaneously, the EU moves closer to a ban on seal pup products, an issue close to her heart. She has spent her latter years being kindly to the animals and frightful to the humans. An icon one can do without."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
