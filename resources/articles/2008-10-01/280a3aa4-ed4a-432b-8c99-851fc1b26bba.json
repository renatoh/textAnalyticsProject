But financing alone won't explain away the amateurishness on display. Some of the dialogue is worse than patchy, though Life On Mars duo John Simm and Philip Glenister, crossing to the bad side as crooks alongside Ashley Walters, make a reasonable go of it. They are after a giant emerald being delivered to a Japanese bank. There is some fancy footwork as multiple heists unfold during police interrogation. But there's no escaping a deluge of retro naffness."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
