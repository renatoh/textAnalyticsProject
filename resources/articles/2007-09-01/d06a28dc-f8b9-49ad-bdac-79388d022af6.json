The transcripts reveal the parts played in the scandal by high-ranking figures in the British team. Mike Coughlan Chief designer (suspended July 3) Coughlan was the man who had previously worked with Nigel Stepney at Ferrari and was in email contact with the disaffected Ferrari employee. He dined with Stepney in Spain on April 28 and returned home with a 780-page dossier which his wife subsequently had duplicated. Coughlan claimed he had had no further contact with Stepney, contradicted by Italian police evidence. When did he know? Had contact with Stepney before Australian GP in March Ron Dennis Chief executive officer As McLaren's team principal, Dennis became aware of Coughlan's possession of the dossier on July 2 when lawyers went into the designer's house, and suspended him. Launched investigation and, at Silverstone on July 5, insisted no Ferrari intellectual property had been used by McLaren. Made aware that Fernando Alonso had relevant information on his computer on morning of Hungarian GP, August 5, but not of its nature. When did he know? Aware of extent of drivers' involvement in early September Martin Whitmarsh Chief operating officer Maintains a presence in the design area without being \"hands-on\". Discussed with Dennis and MD Jonathan Neale the installation of a firewall in April to stop Stepney communications. Became aware of driver emails on same day as Dennis and suggested the FIA president, Max Mosley, should be brought into the loop. Claimed Coughlan's contact with Honda's team principal Nick Fry proved the designer had his own agenda. When did he know? Aware of extent of drivers' involvement in early September Jonathan Neale Managing director Also involved in the firewall installation. He knew of Coughlan's dissatisfaction with his role at McLaren. Breakfasted with Coughlan to thrash out differences. Possibly as a negotiating ploy, Coughlan produced a confidential Ferrari drawing. Neale claims to have refused to take it and told Coughlan to destroy it. Refused to accept Ferrari allegations that it was fed into McLaren design group. When did he know? Aware of Coughlan-Stepney communications in March but not their nature Paddy Lowe Engineering director Lowe said that no employee of his 140-strong engineering group had knowledge of Ferrari's technical information. He said he would have known if anything \"foreign\" had been introduced because he was aware of every aspect of the car developments, which happen, on average, \"every 20 minutes\". Ferrari claimed that to be an impossibility. When did he know? Aware of implications for engineering group after driver emails given to FIA in September Rob Taylor Design group Taylor worked with Mike Coughlan at Ferrari and Arrows in the 1990s and is a friend. He claimed that a drawing he was shown in the hearing, purporting to be one Coughlan received from Stepney and showed Taylor in April, was not the same one. He said he did not know that Coughlan wanted to leave McLaren. When did he know? Shown drawings by Coughlan in May but claimed not to know they were Ferrari information Fernando Alonso World champion 2005 and 2006 Refused to attend the hearing and was upset by a number of incidents at the Hungarian GP, the day he told Dennis he had relevant email information on his laptop. He later retracted the claims and apologised to Dennis. When did he know?

Included Alonso in the loop and sought further information that Alonso requested. When did he know? Had email contact with Coughlan from March Lewis Hamilton McLaren driver Gave evidence that he has not had any email contact with De la Rosa or any of the team engineers regarding Ferrari information. Hamilton's counsel pleaded that he had not done anything wrong and should not be punished. When did he know?
