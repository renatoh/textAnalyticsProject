His decision to stay means he now has refugee status and the right to live in freedom in Britain; to his shock, it also meant he spent a month last winter being homeless in Manchester. Abdullah had been living with his sister in Manchester for almost a year, while she studied. When he applied for asylum last November, Abdullah told the Home Office he would become homeless when his sister moved back to Saudi Arabia. Officials reassured him that he could apply for section 98 support, emergency support usually consisting of hostel accommodation and board, once she had gone. He did, but days later received a rejection for asylum support from the Home Office. \u201cThey promised me, when your sister leaves we will help you; they found reasons to refuse me, they refused me three times for different reasons,\u201d he said. Abdullah spent nearly a month homeless during winter in Manchester \u2013 two weeks sleeping rough and then two weeks in a night shelter \u2013 while he obtained further evidence to prove to the Home Office that he did not have any means of supporting himself. This evidence included a letter from his sister confirming that she was no longer supporting him, explanations of money loaned to him by his father to get his original visa, and receipts for everything Abdullah had spent money on in the past 11 months, to prove that none of the money he had had when he arrived in the UK was left. Abdullah is one of 315 asylum seekers and refugees whose cases were analysed for a report by Refugee Action released on Monday, which found the Home Office is missing its own deadlines for responding to applications for asylum support, and wrongly refusing applications for this support, leaving people destitute and homeless while they wait for their asylum claim. In Abdullah\u2019s case, Refugee Action alleges that the Home Office should have granted emergency support to Abdullah while it assessed his financial situation and eligibility for longer-term support, and that its failure to do so was directly responsible for his homelessness. Two days before Christmas, the Home Office acknowledged that Abdullah was indeed destitute as he had originally claimed, and granted him support. He was granted refugee status on 1 April. For others featured in the Refugee Action report, such as Basirat and her sons Abdullahi, 16, and Sultan, 13, while delays in getting asylum support did not lead to homelessness, they have meant a protracted period of time spent in precarious accommodation. Basirat fled Nigeria with her sons after suffering domestic violence at the hands of her brother-in-law who raped her and beat her sons. Abdullahi also endured abuse related to his cerebral palsy. While Basirat\u2019s asylum claim was processed, the family were sleeping on the floor of a damp storeroom in a privately rented house. Because they were not paying rent, the other residents of the house abused them, yelling at the boys if they used the bath or ran water for washing up. The bathroom did not have a lock on the door and, in one instance, an adult visiting one of the other residents walked in on Abdullahi showering. Abdullahi, who has limited mobility and usually does not shower unassisted, says he began to panic. \u201cI was very scared,\u201d said Abdullahi. \u201cI was shaking, I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Basirat applied for section 95 asylum support, which would have given her somewhere safe to live and a small allowance of \u00a336.95 per person per week. Her first claim was refused. When she applied again no response was received for six weeks, during which time the family continued to sleep on the floor of the storeroom. A Refugee Action caseworker chased up the claim with the Home Office and was told officials could not find Basirat\u2019s file on their records. In late March, three months after her initial application for support, Basirat was moved into a flat in Croydon where the family are now safe and mostly comfortable. \u201cI wish Home Office looked deep into asylum seekers,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cThey are leaving their countries to look for a new life, for freedom, not for sleeping in the streets.\u201d Some names have been changed for this article."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
