Adama Barrow, who is in neighbouring Senegal, released a statement on Monday afternoon saying he would be sworn in \u201con Gambian soil\u201d on Thursday. He will then get to \u201cwork on reversing serious damage caused by 22 years of malgovernance\u201d, his spokesman added. Hours earlier, the country\u2019s chief justice said he could not rule on an injunction filed by Jammeh to prevent Barrow\u2019s inauguration going ahead. The incumbent president had tried to prevent Barrow attending his own inauguration, along with many government officials. Barrow won last month\u2019s presidential election, bringing an end to two decades of Jammeh\u2019s rule. But after initially accepting the election result, Jammeh went back on his decision. He said he would nullify the result because of what he claimed were errors made by Gambia\u2019s electoral commission and would remain in power until he could hold new elections. High-level diplomacy by west Africa\u2019s most prominent presidents has failed to persuade him to cede power: two visits by Nigeria\u2019s Muhammadu Buhari and Liberia\u2019s Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who also chairs the regional body ECOWAS, have made Jammeh no less belligerent. On the last visit last week, Barrow left the Gambia with the presidential delegation and went to Mali for a France-Africa summit, at which Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, voiced his support for the former estate agent who achieved his victory by running as the candidate of an eight-party coalition. Barrow later travelled to Senegal. Barrow\u2019s young son died after being bitten by a dog at the weekend, but because he was in Dakar, he was unable to attend the funeral. However, he is expected to be sworn in at the national stadium in the Gambian capital, Banjul. It is remains unclear whether Jammeh will try other means to prevent this. Many of the country\u2019s military and security officers have been arrested in recent days, said Barrow\u2019s spokesman. He condemned their detention as an \u201cegregious act\u201d, adding that the president-elect calls on Gambians not to respond to provocation and to maintain the peace. Thousands of Gambians have fled the country in recent weeks, some afraid that war may break out. ECOWAS has said it will resort to military intervention if necessary. The African Union has said it will cease to recognise Jammeh as president from this Thursday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
