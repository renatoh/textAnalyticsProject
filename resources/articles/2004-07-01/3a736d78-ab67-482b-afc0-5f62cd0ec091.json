Mourinho yesterday outlined his transfer plans, which he hopes to complete before Chelsea fly to the United States on July 21 for their pre-season tour. The news that Rooney does not feature in his thinking will come as a blow to Everton's strategy for the summer. With the 18-year-old hesitating over talks on a contract extension, Everton were hoping to generate an auction to maximise his transfer value. Their initial response to inquiries from Chelsea and Manchester United has been to quote a \u00a350m fee, but with Chelsea ending their interest and United talking about the restrictions of their \"financial parameters\", that is now likely to be closer to \u00a330m. \"I don't think Rooney can come here,\" said Mourinho. \"It is not just that it is too much money. I think we have other priorities in terms of players, positions, qualities. \"Rooney is a wonderful attacking player, but he is not the target man - he plays with free movement just behind on both sides and we have other players with these qualities.\" Nevertheless there remains a vacancy in Chelsea's front line after Mourinho indicated Hern\u00e1n Crespo would not start the season with his club. A free transfer to Milan is expected. \"We sent letters to all the players asking them to be at Stamford Bridge at breakfast at 8.15am and Crespo was not there,\" said Mourinho. Mourinho has set himself a 15-day deadline to complete his summer transfer activity, with Mateja Kezman soon to join from PSV Eindhoven in a \u00a35.4m deal. Chelsea have lodged a work-permit request with the Home Office for the Serbia-Montenegro international striker, who will complete the move this week after undergoing a medical yesterday. \"He scores goals, a lot of goals. I like him because he is multi-functional - he adapts to different roles in the attacking positions,\" said Mourinho. \"He is not just the pure striker to play as a target man. He can play also with two strikers in the middle, as a winger from the right side. \"He is a complete, multi-functional player. I like him because of his physical toughness. He is not a big boy, but sometimes big players are not physically strong enough.\" Despite recent reports, there will be no room at Chelsea for Edgar Davids since Mourinho is not convinced the Holland midfielder fits the required profile. With the diminutive Claude Makelele already occupying the role of holding midfielder, Mourinho does not consider Davids suitable. \"I would not like him here,\" said Mourinho. \"He is a very good player, but I think in English football you cannot play with two players of 170cm [5ft 7in] together in midfield. \"If I did not have Makelele I would say Davids is a very good player with a very strong personality, but in combination and with the needs of the team I think he is not the right balance with Makelele.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
