South Africa, Hong Kong, Australia and the United States will all send major players to the big sprint events in Berkshire next week, and for Britain's training fraternity, left trailing by Ireland in the Derby last weekend, further embarrassment surely awaits. Scenic Blast, trained by Dan Morton in Perth in Western Australia, is second-favourite for the King's Stand Stakes on Tuesday, while three of the first four names in the betting for the Golden Jubilee Stakes sprint four days later are trained outside Europe. Morton is just 36, and had no idea at the turn of the year that he might need a tailcoat in June. Scenic Blast was not among the favourites when he won the Lightning Stakes at Flemington back in January, the victory that earned him an invitation to Ascot. \"I'd never put much homework into coming here until we got the invite but it's a big gig,\" Morton said in the Jockey Club rooms here in Newmarket yesterday. \"Obviously we know that it's the mecca for you guys, but the Aussies have been up here quite a few times now and there's been quite a lot of coverage down there from the Choisir years on, so we're fully aware of it.\" Choisir was an unconsidered 25-1 chance when he won the King's Stand in 2003, but two more Australian victories in the same race since \u2013 by Miss Andretti and Takeover Target, who will run in the Golden Jubilee Stakes tomorrow week \u2013 have ensured that Australian contenders now receive much more respect. \"He was very impressive,\" Morton says. \"He looked to still have the handbrake on with two furlongs to go when the rest were all under pressure. It was a good field, and he was pretty dominant. \"If I was going to pick any horse out of my string to travel [this far], he'd be the one. He's very laid-back, and apart from it being a long haul, I had no real concerns. \"At home, the east coast is where it all happens, so if we want to perform on the big stage, that's where we go. It's nearly four hours on the plane, and he's done it three times, so he knows all about getting on and off, it's just a lot longer in the air.\" Scenic Blast caught Morton's eye as soon as he saw him at a yearling sale in Australia. \"He was a beautiful yearling,\" he says. \"My dad [also a trainer] and myself do all the yearlings, and to us he was a standout. We got him fairly cheap for A$85,000 (\u00a342,000 at current rates). Steve Arnold [his regular jockey] will ride, he's first-class, and it was more important for me to have someone who knew my horse than someone who knew the track.\" Scenic Blast's run on Tuesday will determine whether he also contests the Golden Jubilee Stakes, but with Takeover Target, Hong Kong's top sprinter Sacred Kingdom and Mike de Kock's JJ The Jet Plane in the field, the race still appears marked for export. \"It's a big effort [to run in two races in a week] so we are just going for the Golden Jubilee this year,\" Joe Janiak, Takeover Target's trainer, said yesterday. \"Sacred Kingdom looks the biggest danger after he won in Singapore last time. He's a great horse but then again he's got to travel and everything has to go right. JJ The Jet Plane was very convincing the other day, those are the two I respect.\" Ron Cox's tip of the day Yirga 3.50 Sandown Unable to quicken in the closing stages in testing ground at Haydock last month, Yirga should be more effective on this better going. The Godolphin colt certainly looks well handicapped off a mark of 74, having chased home the useful Desert Creek on his debut last season. Yirga went on to finish third, beaten a length, by Laudatory at Kempton and meets the winner on 9lb better terms here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
