She's a British expat in the heart of Manhattan. She wants to be a novelist but can't get inspired; instead, she makes money naming lipsticks for Grrrl, an edgy brand of 'ugly' make-up owned by her unpleasant schoolfriend, Holly. Sadie is messy, antsy and high-maintenance, so naturally she wants to be saved by love. It looks as if she might be in with a chance when she meets Marley, a graffiti artist with a six-year-old daughter, Montana. Sadie, who has a sizable father fixation, finds herself fighting Montana for Marley's love. Cherries in the Snow is a brittle novel overrun by unlikable characters who are affluent, thoughtless, achingly cool and inclined towards cruelty. Sadie is up there with the other disagreeables, self-absorbed, brattish and manipulative, forever locking herself in other people's bathrooms to weep dramatically. Yet Forrest's taut prose makes this a likable book. It has pace, energy and eccentric, valid observation. And it has Emma Forrest's voice - flippant, irreverent and modern."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
