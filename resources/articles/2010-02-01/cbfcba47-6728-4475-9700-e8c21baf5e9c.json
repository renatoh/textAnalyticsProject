This is a sugary ensemble romcom by Garry \"Pretty Woman\" Marshall, starring Julia Roberts, Anne Hathaway, Jamie Foxx, Bradley \"Hangover\" Cooper and many more. It makes Love, Actually look like Citizen Kane. At least Richard Curtis gave us some nice gags and touching moments. Nothing like that here: just a yucky, plasticky confection of sentimentality, like eating fudge with the cellophane wrapper still on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
