Being fashionable this season is not just about dropping a wodge of cash in Harvey Nichols and swanning about with Alexander McQueen's new Novak bag swinging from your arm. If it were that simple, then someone else could do it for you. No, being fashionable, like going to the loo, is something you can only do for yourself. A degree of effort is required in order to understand the nuances that will make you infinitely more stylish this season. 1: Have a Hitchcock boxset marathon If you've been concentrating, you'll know that McQueen's new bag is named after Kim Novak. His show invite - a pastiche of the Vertigo poster - was further evidence of the catwalk's Hitchcock obsession. Roland Mouret also homed in on the curvy silhouettes of the era's silver screen heroines. But these beautifully crafted skirt suits usually carry hefty price tags. No matter. All a Hitchcock-fest needs is a quick visit to HMV to buy the requisite DVDs, the flick of a venetian blind, and a slick of fire-red Chanel lipstick. You'll be Grace Kelly dialling M for murder in no time. 2: Take a ballet lesson Aside from the obvious benefits of improved posture, there's also a style trick not to be missed. After a summer of ballet pumps (Chanel if you were lucky/extravagant), we should all be ready for Alber Elbaz of Lanvin's flat-pumps-and-cocktail-dress look by now. Factor in Ms Prada's reliance on wide black hairbands and chignons at her catwalk show, and it's clear that ballet, not ballroom, is the way forward. Add to that the fact that a ballet-refined walk makes even cheap clothes look expensive, and the case is closed. 3: Learn the words to Babooshka What is the sartorial significance of Kate Bush's work of lyrical genius? Obvious. A babushka (or babooshka) is both an old woman and a headscarf traditionally worn by Russian peasants. The fashion industry has embraced all things Russian this season. Knowing the words will hint that you realise the style may be ephemeral but, crucially, you know it exists. 4: Join the National Trust This is the perfect way to channel the British heritage look with far more cerebral benefits than a trip to the high street could ever give. Log on to nationaltrust.org.uk to join, then swan about historic houses snorting authentic aristocratic dust in William Morris printed rooms, gratis. The chilliness of these piles, rather than an appreciation of the Duchess of Cornwall's much-lauded look, should be your motivation for layering on plaid, tweed and argyle. Christopher Bailey of Burberry will be proud. 5: Ignore the weather This is a fashion law with much precedence. Fashion is too imperious to bend to the diktats of nature, hence we have the seemingly oxymoronic \"winter shorts\" as a trend. Seriously. Betty Jackson's wool ones, worn with cream tights, make for a persuasive argument. And they're less draughty than skirts. 6: Embrace the Clich\u00e9 The phrase \"black is back\" is enough to make you sick to your core, but fashion's wheel has turned again. Note, this isn't a lazy way to opt out of the fashion circus. It is acceptable to say that black is back, but you must qualify this with an enigmatic \"but it is not the same\". That way, you'll acquire an air of authority. 7: Return your library books Assuming, of course, that you are a member of your municipal library. If not, join, and engage in regular visits wearing sombre cashmere cardigans and wool trousers, and carrying a quilted bag. Camilla Staerk's glasses will garner extra points. Sceptical folk might regard this as a step too far into anorak territory. They'd probably be right, but you're attempting to imbibe the spirit of the season here, and ultimately a civic visit such as this beats a trip to Debenhams on a Saturday afternoon, hands down. 8: Pull any loose threads Surely this was how the puffball skirt was invented. Let's imagine Marc Jacobs was struck by an Isaac Newton/apple moment. A thread caught on the hem of the heavy wool skirt he was working on. He stepped back and thought, \"Blimey - that looks good, that does.\" And thus the puffball skirt was reborn. Meanwhile, in other workshops across Paris, Stella McCartney and Stefano Pilati at Yves Saint Laurent were having similar happy accidents. Whatever, puffball or hem-rolled skirts have become a hot autumn trend. 9: Visit the National Gallery And you thought fashion was lowbrow. Wrong. Study the portraits of the Dutch masters (the timely Rubens: A Master In The Making opens next month at the National Gallery), and ponder the similarities between Lily Cole and luminous-skinned, bright-eyed beauties of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Freshly inspired, you should pop along to Boots' make-up counter on your way home and start experimenting with this season's so-called Flemish Face make-up trend. 10: Book a city break to Vienna Soaking up the fancy Hapsburg architecture, and taking in the refined autumnal colour palette of Egon Schiele's artwork will be good for the soul, and good for your wardrobe. Why? Because Marc Jacobs sent his Louis Vuitton design team there for inspiration for the label's winter collection. The same man who has perfected the round-toed pump and who once dressed as a rabbit for his own party. Clearly, a man who is worth listening to."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
