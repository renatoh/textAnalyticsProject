As cameos go, Wise went. Dennis Wise, in his first match as caretaker manager, gave himself six minutes to hold Millwall's line and lead after David Livermore's dismissal. He lasted four before going the same way, for a two-footed tackle. The only difference was that Wise returned to his seat in the stand beside Theo Paphitis. \"I gave him a kiss,\" said the chairman, unfazed to see him back so soon. \"It was the only decision Rob Styles got right all game.\" Cheek at the New Den comes from the top. So does responsibility, though. Fans may sing \"No one likes us; we don't care\" but \"Lions have pride not prejudice,\" says a prominent notice in the programme. \"Respect each other - respect all fans.\" The manager, \"disappointed\" with the referee, was typically Wise after the event: \"I said to him, 'Well done, Rob. Fantastic.' He fought he done right. I missed the ball. It doesn't bovver me about red cards [after a dozen the 13th is nuffink] and I don't want to harp on about that. I want to harp on about the way the lads played. They done great, the performance was great and I'm chuffed to bits. \"Me and Ray [Wilkins] only had Friday to sort fings out. We changed fings a tiny bit, getting Neil Harris to play in the hole, and it went better.\" He also ditched Mark McGhee's unpopular 3-5-2 for 4-4-2, dropped himself to bring Livermore in from the left, \"where he was lost\", and brought in Aboubaka Fofana for speedy width. Livermore was outstanding, Harris boundingly intelligent and Fofana's pace induced the penalty that set Millwall on their way to overcoming the division's leaders. The elusive Paul Ifill's second confirmed it. \"Everything was geared for Millwall,\" said Neil Warnock. \"Dennis did exceptionally well . . . managerially.\" He was right. Millwall could have won with seven men, which is what Sheffield United sometimes sink to. Wise has a way of getting on with chairmen (Ken Bates, for impossible instance) better than authority or taxi drivers. In 1995 he was convicted of assault but acquitted on appeal. A year ago Leicester sacked him after he broke Callum Davidson's jaw over a game of cards. Paphitis put him in charge on Wednesday, the day after David Blunkett stepped up his drive on anti-social behaviour orders. Players are increasingly revolting but Wise, who led a team meeting after Millwall's abject defeat against Preston that led to McGhee's going, rubbished stories of a plot to overthrow him. \"We just felt we had let ourselves and everyone down,\" he said, though there is no denying lingering dissatisfaction over contracts. The caretaker was equally adamant he is not ready at 36 for the job full-time: \"I want to play for one more year and I need to do the apprenticeship, but I really enjoyed it.\" Applicants are said to have topped 100, possibly on the basis that, if Wise can be considered, anyone might be. This may be a false premise. \"The choice is Feo's problem,\" said Wise. \"He's the main man.\" Wilkins, who has carried on going sideways since he stopped playing, paced the dug-out zone while Wise watched from the stand, attentive as a 10-year-old at a Harry Potter film, miraculously restrained. Tempting fate, Wilkins said: \"Dennis will stamp his character on the team.\" At half-time Wise, who made Kevin Muscat captain, went out, notes in hand, to pat bottoms before following down the tunnel with Styles, a hand on each other's shoulder like old mates. Later he said: \"I told Feo you've got to sort that poxy phone out. I can't talk to Ray on that.\" Den lines of communication are open, for Wisecracks at least.
