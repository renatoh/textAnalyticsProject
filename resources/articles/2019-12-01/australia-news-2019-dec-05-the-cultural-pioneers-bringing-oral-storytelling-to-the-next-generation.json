And then there\u2019s also anger,\u201d he says. Leavy is a Kooma man and founder of Brisbane-based Virtual Songlines: a First Nations interactive design agency whose output ranges from video games to virtual reality. \u201cI\u2019m doing this in a fun way \u2013 it\u2019s a bit gamefied \u2013 but the question I\u2019m asking is: who are the sovereign custodians of the land?\u201d For millennia, Indigenous Australian communities have been passing down histories, knowledge, language and customs, largely through oral storytelling. But in a world of digital addiction, where even the most remote parts of the country are being infiltrated by smartphones, telling stories via screens is the new necessary: a way to both preserve tradition and reach out to the young. And arts organisations are taking note: Indigenous digital storytelling forms a key part of major exhibitions ranging from Linear at Sydney\u2019s Powerhouse Museum \u2013 an exploration of Indigenous culture, lineage and storytelling across science, VR, technology and design \u2013 to the new permanent exhibition at Acmi in Melbourne, opening in 2020. And for many pioneers in the digital space, harnessing the tools of a new virtual world is a critical way to ensure Indigenous people retain control over their own stories. \u201cThere is massive intellectual capital in our community. There is this whole untapped resource,\u201d Mikaela Jade, founder of the Indigenous augmented reality app Indigital Storytelling, said at a talk in Sydney in 2017. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for it to be built and then be given it to us.\u201d Stephen Page, creative director of Indigenous dance company Bangarra, is taking this idea seriously. This week, to celebrate its 30th anniversary, Bangarra will open a free immersive installation, Knowledge Ground: 30 Years of Sixty-Five Thousand, at Carriageworks, Sydney. Visitors will navigate between thematic \u201cworlds\u201d \u2013 costumes, artefacts, video, photographs and soundscapes \u2013 to explore the history of Bangarra, and the Indigenous concepts of \u201ccountry, language and kinship\u201d that inspires it. The event will also herald the launch of the company\u2019s new digital archive site of the same name, which contains interviews, photographs, videos and essays about Bangarra\u2019s productions and processes. Both the website and the installation aim to take a deeper dive into the stories behind Bangarra\u2019s dance performances, which have covered everything from the non-fiction Indigenous book Dark Emu to historical Indigenous figures. \u201cIt\u2019s in our Indigenous DNA to take oral stories, to pass that on as a way to carry culture,\u201d Page says. \u201cThe digital platform is another way to seduce \u2013 not even seduce, to inform \u2013 the next generation.\u201d Of course simply putting content up online \u2013 or placing it on a screen in an art show \u2013 does not mean it will automatically make an impact, or find an audience. Torres Strait Islander filmmaker John Harvey, 44, sees this harsh truth every day at home on the Sunshine Coast with his two children, aged four and 13. Kids, he sighs, are brutally honest. If online content doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel authentic to them in a way that they can relate to, they will stop straight away. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s been made by an Indigenous person or not \u2013 they will just stop.\u201d Harvey is in the process of creating a work for the new permanent exhibition at ACMI, which opens in Melbourne in May 2020. Inspiration came from seeing the first-ever footage of Indigenous people in Australia: a four-and-a-half minute sequence shot by British zoologist AC Haddon during a Cambridge University expedition to the Torres Strait in 1898. Locals were portrayed as anthropological subjects. In his artwork, Harvey wants to counteract this by filming intimate moments at home. Rather than white rich outsiders holding the camera, he\u2019s using his own phone to capture his own people as he sees them, from the inside. It is, as he says, about \u201cdemocratisation of stories and storytelling.\u201d \u201cAs we have increased our capacity to make [films] cheaper and by ourselves, it gives you more autonomy,\u201d he insists. \u201cIn this country we see black men reflected in a particular way and it can often be a negative portrayal. [Smartphones] give the power to people who may not be known.\u201d In the Northern Territory, artists and storytellers are turning to virtual reality. One project developed by senior Anangu women and the Uti Kulintjaku team of ngangkari (healers) \u2013 in association with UNSW and the Big Anxiety festival \u2013 tells the tjurrkupa, or Anangu story of waumananyi: the song on the wind. In the story, a hunter becomes trapped in a large log, and relies on his two wives to feed him. He oscillates between wanting the women to abandon him and to care for themselves, and wanting them to stay with him. Eventually, a traditional healer breaks open the log. \u201cThey are using this story as a way to describe how addiction can trap people, but also how the support of family and healers can set trapped people free,\u201d says Angela Lynch, manager of the Ngangkari program at NPY Women\u2019s Council. The embedded video below gives an idea of the story and its soundtrack \u2013 the man sings the inma, the traditional song of this story \u2013 but you need the right gear to get the full experience. Virtual reality was not an obvious tool to tell the story. But many of the senior women observed young people \u201cincreasingly engaging with screens and technology, and so wanted to capture their attention and interest,\u201d Lynch says. \u201cThey strongly believe that traditional culture and Anangu law holds the answers to the issues and problems of contemporary life in remote communities.\u201d Digital storytelling, however, has its challenges. Harvey \u2013 who is filming his own family for the Acmi project \u2013 warns screens can become a burden, or an invasion of privacy: \u201cBy filming something on your phone and sharing that online, you have to realise that you are then sharing that with a much broader audience than you might have thought about. Communities have to be aware of that and what it means.\u201d \u201cYou go to a rock concert and they will say: \u2018No cameras. [The experience] is just for the people here.\u2019 Do we do that in our communities?\u201d he asks. But Leavy wants his Virtual Songlines to reach as wide an audience as possible. Many of his projects enable visitors to enact a cultural survival game; others involve a knowledge-based quest. That little bit of competition, he believes, keeps interest piqued, creating a far wider appeal than historical texts or paintings. It has worked. When Leavy presented a showcase at Customs House in Circular Quay in 2011, the City of Sydney council recorded visitor numbers in excess of 300,000. And this January, Virtual Songlines will showcase Virtual Warrane 1788 \u2013 a VR experience of Sydney Cove prior to the arrival of the First Fleet. As Leavy puts it: \u201cWe\u2019re really trying to time travel. We\u2019ve got a big story to tell.\u201d Knowledge Ground: 30 Years of Sixty Five Thousand is open at Carriageworks, Sydney, until December 14; Indigital Storytelling can be downloaded from the Apple store; Virtual Songlines\u2019 Virtual Warrane 1788 will show at the Overseas Passenger Terminal in Sydney on 26 January"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
