The targeting of Rory McIlroy by the United States merely highlights the Northern Irishman\u2019s status and significance in the European camp. An innocuous press conference answer by McIlroy on Wednesday, regarding Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson being in the latter stages of their careers and with a recent history of injury, landed the 25-year-old in the middle of a contrived storm. Elements of the American media were hardly innocent, having seized upon McIlroy\u2019s \u2013 wholly accurate \u2013 sentiment. By Wednesday night McIlroy had taken to Twitter to assert that he had always been \u201ccomplimentary\u201d about the duo in question. Which was another truism. Having signed for an opening round of 69, one under par, at the Tour Championship, McIlroy was quite right to state his case once again. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t understand the backlash,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I was writing them off at all. I just said Tiger didn\u2019t get the chance to play here because he was injured and that Phil has played great at times. I said that we\u2019ll see them both back at this event plenty of times. But when I saw the reaction I thought: \u2018Hang on, have I said something wrong here? I don\u2019t think so.\u2019 I know those guys both really well and I don\u2019t think I said anything out of order. I went on Twitter to try to clarify it. I couldn\u2019t believe the reaction.\u201d When asked if he would shy away from any remarks about Woods in particular from now on, a McIlroy smile followed. \u201cNo. I have said far worse things to Tiger\u2019s face.\u201d With neither Woods nor Mickelson in the field for the finale of the FedEx play-off series, McIlroy is the marquee name. Yet it is unfortunate if the four-times major winner\u2019s candour is to be used against him. Unlike others on the golf scene, McIlroy does not dodge questions. On the course, McIlroy\u2019s opening hole rather summed up what was to follow. He carved a three wood right at the 1st and hit a tree branch when trying to play back to safety before almost holing his subsequent wedge shot. McIlroy had four birdies and three bogeys during what he later described as a \u201cgrind\u201d. He added: \u201cI haven\u2019t been firing on all cylinders for a couple of weeks now but it\u2019s just a case of hanging in there. I was pleased with the score because that 69 could have been a 73 or 74 in past years. I really want this win to put the icing on the cake of a great year.\u201d The Ryder Cup is also pertinent in the context of the leaderboard here. McIlroy\u2019s Thursday playing partner, Bubba Watson, is one shot from the lead at three under par. He has two more of Tom Watson\u2019s team members, Patrick Reed and Jim Furyk, for scoring company while Matt Kuchar and Zach Johnson signed for 68s. Chris Kirk and Billy Horschel, neither of whom will play at Gleneagles, lead the way at minus four. Jason Day\u2019s 67 was notable because of the circumstances surrounding it. The Australian\u2019s caddie, Colin Swatton, had to depart the course after just seven holes because of a back problem. Day\u2019s mind coach, Jason Goldsmith, duly stepped in for a bit of manual labour. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Colin did to his back last night but he did something,\u201d said Day. \u201cJason did a good job, though. He did a really good job. It was kind of something where it just kind of clicked. It worked. \u201cI told Colin: \u2018Look, if you get out there and you pull out, I\u2019m going to be very pissed.\u2019 I said: \u2018Take the day off. Get some rest. Because if you just miss today and you feel better tomorrow, then I\u2019ve got you for the next three days. If you pull out, if you go and caddie and can\u2019t caddie tomorrow because you hurt your back even more \u2026\u2019\u201d Suffice to say, player-caddie relations in the Day camp may not be at an all-time high."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
