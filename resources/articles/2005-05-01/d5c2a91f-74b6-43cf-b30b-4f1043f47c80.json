The midfielder's existing deal runs out at the end of next season and he wants to secure his future at Highbury until 2008. Arsenal have so far indicated a willingness to give Pires only a further year. \"I want to stay at Arsenal,\" Pires said. \"I have given them my position, which is that I would like to sign for two years or maybe three years. \"But it is not me who decides, it is Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and [the vice-chairman] Mr [David] Dein and now I will see what they are going to tell me.\" Pires said there had been contact from other clubs and has hinted at playing in Spain if he cannot agree terms at Arsenal, where he would like to end his career. Asked what he would do if offered only a year, he said: \"I don't know. I will have to think about it.\" The 31-year-old said he was \"not stressed\" about his position but emphasised the importance of experience if Arsenal are to prosper in Europe. \"For the Champions League we need to buy some players with more experience,\" he said, \"but for the Premier League I think it could be enough with our very promising young players.\" Asked about getting David Beckham, he said with a smile: \"It could be good.\" Pires feels Arsenal are prepared if Manchester United play hard today. \"I don't agree we are vulnerable physically and the [semi-final] against Blackburn is a very good example. We have improved lots. They kicked us lots and there was lots of provocation but we stayed calm and [in Cardiff] we will have to stay calm as well.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
