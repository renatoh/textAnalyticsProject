It makes a refreshing change then that the ECB has announced that the England team's shirts during the World Twenty20 tournament will display the logo of a humanitarian aid agency rather than a corporate sponsor. Tournament regulations set by the International Cricket Council prohibit the name of England's current corporate partner, Vodafone, from appearing on team kit because a rival telecommunications firm is already sponsoring the event. The ECB could have struck another sponsorship deal \u2013 one that did not conflict with the ICC \u2013 for the duration of the three-week tournament but instead has decided to display the emblem of the Cricket Against Hunger partnership, to advertise its partnership with the United Nations' World Food Programme and raise awareness about the humanitarian agency's work to alleviate hunger around the world. Given that the ECB so often appears to be at the beck and call of mammon, the good publicity it will generate for making this decision is well deserved. There are 4.4m beneficiaries of WFP aid in Zimbabwe alone, the former home of the England team director, Andy Flower, and he spoke honestly about how pleased his team were to be able to support its work. \"We live very privileged lives as cricketers,\" Flower said, \"and very occasionally we get opportunities to bring attention to more important issues, so I'm very proud of the fact that we've taken this opportunity to do something good.\" \"We are in a luxury position,\" agreed Kevin Pietersen, whose earnings during his two-week stint in the IPL could have funded 1,823,720 WFP school meals, \"but we've got the power to go out there and say, 'This is an initiative that can really save lives.' Every single England cricketer that's participating in the World Twenty20 for England with this emblem on their shirts is going to be very proud.\" The ECB has been in partnership with the WFP since the Champions Trophy in 2006, when the England team visited a school in Rajasthan where the organisation was at work. Since then England players have regularly given coaching sessions and held fund-raising events for the WFP while on tour in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. \"Cricket fans are a constituency we wouldn't normally expect to reach,\" explained the WFP spokeswoman Caroline Hurford. \"Hunger doesn't hit the headlines much. Most of the 25,000 people who die each day of hunger-related causes do so in a dusty village far away from the spotlight that falls on a disaster such as an earthquake or a war, but hunger kills more people every year than AIDS, malaria and TB combined.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
