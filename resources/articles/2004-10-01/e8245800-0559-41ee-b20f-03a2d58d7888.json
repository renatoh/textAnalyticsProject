Practically all newspapers were against the proposals to pave the way for 24-hour giant casinos, including the two that the Labour government so assiduously cultivates - the Daily Mail and the Sun. A Mail editorial claimed it was \"a shaming, shameful day for the party that came into being to defend the poor\" while the Sun said: \"The risk to society the government must confront is the plan for 24-hour casinos, some with unlimited jackpots\". On this occasion the popular press was echoing feelings in the country at large. An opinion poll carried out by NOP found that 93% of the British public thought there were already quite enough opportunities to gamble. Widespread outrage at the casinos proposal obscured the bill's perfectly sensible and constructive call to curb abuses such as the proliferation of fruit machines in takeaways and mini-cab offices. The question is - what happens next? It would be nice to think that the government might show a little humility and drastically amend the bill to meet justified criticism. But Tony Blair does not do humility. This means only parliament can prevent the government using its large majority to steamroller the bill through. This is a good time for MPs to ask themselves what they are in parliament for if not to raise objections to shoddy and unpopular policies emanating from suspect sources - in this case an unholy alliance between a government seeking fresh ways of raising revenues and the casino industry seeking huge profits, largely at the expense of the poor. Labour MPs should close ranks when the bill comes back to the house next month, ignore their party whips and strike out the clauses that will inevitably lead to an explosion of 24-hour casinos in city centres. Such a move would be good in itself and would help restore the government's priorities. Does this Labour government really want to go down in history as one that saw a fresh decline of British manufacturing while presiding over an explosion of casinos?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
