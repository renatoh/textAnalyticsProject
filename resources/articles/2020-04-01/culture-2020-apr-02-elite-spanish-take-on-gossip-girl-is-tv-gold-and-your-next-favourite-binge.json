Like any former Gossip Girl tragic, I\u2019ve spent the better part of the last decade trying \u2013 and failing \u2013 to fill the Upper East Side-shaped hole in my heart. I\u2019ve consumed every piece of media even tangentially related to the original. Some have come close: Riverdale, with its menagerie of misbehaving teens; Dynasty\u2019s reboot, in all its brand-name opulence; even reality TV bandwagoners like NYC Prep, providing guilty indulgences into the lifestyles of the rich and (briefly) famous. But no show has quite lived up to Gossip Girl\u2019s moreish absurdity. Well, no show except one. Enter: Elite, a Spanish teen soap-slash-murder mystery set at Las Encinas, a private school for the heirs and heiresses of billion-dollar fortunes. Created by Carlos Montero and Dar\u00edo Madrona, and streaming in full on Netflix, Elite somehow manages the impossible \u2013 taking all the campy, catty qualities which made Gossip Girl great while leaving its worst plot holes and contrivances (season four onwards, I\u2019m looking at you) where they belong: locked away in Blair Waldorf\u2019s closet. Speaking of Blair, she meets her match in Elite\u2019s queen bee Lucrecia (Danna Paola), the sassy, permanently bejewelled daughter of a Mexican ambassador whose headband collection rivals her Manhattan counterpart\u2019s. Then there\u2019s her boyfriend, resident hunk Guzman (Miguel Bernardeau), and his free-spirited (but still rich, in case that wasn\u2019t obvious) sister Marina (Maria Pedraza), as well as long-term it-couple Polo and Carla (\u00c1lvaro Rico Ladera and Ester Exp\u00f3sito) who might just be secretly manipulating each other. If all this is sounding like a shopping list of tired high school tropes, never fear: they\u2019re upended before the pilot episode is even out. A series of shady dealings schemed by Guzman\u2019s construction magnate father leads to the roof collapsing at a nearby public school. The result: three of its working-class students \u2013 Nadia (Mina El Hammani), Samuel (Itzan Escamilla) and Christian (Miguel Herr\u00e1n) \u2013 get a free ride to Las Encinas. \u201cThis is fucking paradise, man,\u201d Christian smirks as he walks up to the school building on his first day. He doesn\u2019t know the hell that\u2019s about to break loose. I won\u2019t spoil too much about the murder that frames the show, but suffice to say that it leaves no character unsuspected. Flicking between police interrogations and teen drama, Elite\u2019s flashback structure creates some kind of alchemy, one which turns blood (of murdered students), sweat (of couples \u2013 and throuples \u2013 getting it on) and tears (of betrayed best friends) into television gold. And that\u2019s just season one. Thanks to its razor-sharp writing, it manages to remain nail-biting throughout its supercharged teenage distractions \u2013 think raucous pool parties, locker-room fights and beautiful people backstabbing each other. The writing is also what sustains it through another two seasons (and hopefully the just-announced fourth), set in the aftermath of the murder investigation. Unlike its TV predecessors, which tended to jump the shark too early in desperate hopes that increasingly bombastic scenarios could reclaim falling ratings, Elite only proves more and more considered. Sure, each season brings with it a new juicy, deranged mystery: another death, a sudden disappearance. But, equally importantly, every member of its ensemble cast is given time to stew and develop. One of the sweetest queer romances \u2013 maybe ever \u2013 blossoms. Class loyalties break in the face of unlikely friendships. Elite stops just short of calling for all-out class warfare a la Britney Spears, but it\u2019s still crazy that a show about the sociopathically rich \u2013 and just plain sociopathic \u2013 ends up \u2026 kind of wholesome? Come for the trashy escapism, stay for the addictive character arcs that\u2019ll leave you scrolling through discussion forums and stars\u2019 social accounts for far longer than Elite\u2019s 24-episode run. It\u2019s the distraction we deserve right now. \u2022 All seasons of Elite are available on Netflix"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
