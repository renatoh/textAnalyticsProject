I have just completed my stint at the holding camp in Cyprus and things seem to be coming together quite nicely. I've done 14 separate interviews on the GB team chances with only one or two going a little wobbly and I'm now not sweating as much in front of the camera as when I first arrived. Just one or two more radio sessions to fit in and I should be ready for Athens. Thankfully the same appears to be the case with Team GB. The holding camp is as relaxed a place as you are likely to find in these frenetic last few days leading up to the competition. Eyebrows were raised when the British Olympic Association chose to base the team at a resort hotel prior to the Games, which is still open to holidaymakers, most of whom seem to be from Britain. However, by sectioning off designated areas and employing discreet security the athletes come and go without much interruption and the other hotel guests are too busy enjoying themselves to care about chasing photos and autographs. Not so of course the media. Over the weekend their numbers started to swell and, without too much to write or talk about we have at times resorted to interviewing each other just to keep our hand in. The situation was eased somewhat when Bill Sweetenham, the swimming performance director, finally loosened the shackles on his supremely disciplined squad. Every sport has its own way of handling these situations but this swim team is hugely impressive in everything it does and looks well poised to wipe away the memory of Sydney and win medals in the Athens pool. Not that they are allowed to say as much. Sweetenham will talk about almost anything except the dreaded 'M' word, but rest assured he has this team fired up and confident. Thankfully for the holidaymakers he commands only the superb 50m pool here on site, otherwise the lunchtime pool aerobics might not be as much fun. Equally impressive has been the conduct of our lone boxing representative, Amir Khan from Bury. Only 17 years of age, he looks as though he was born to this. Perhaps the confidence of youth coupled with a hint of naivety is just the right combination. He handled his day in front of the media with aplomb and talks a lot of common sense. A visit from Audley Harrison and entourage yesterday cut a stark contrast in more ways than one with this 60kg contender who is adamant that the Olympic dream is one he will pursue until Beijing if necessary. Back at the camp there was some disappointment on Sunday amongst the badminton squad. Despite possessing real medal prospects the turnout at their press conference was considered to be surprisingly low until someone pointed out that Arsenal v Man Utd on TV had perhaps proven to be a distraction in some areas of the media. Maybe the badminton team manager could start a dalliance with one of the admin team and give them some great headlines involving shuttlecocks. The chance of any such excitement seems remote. The only hint of controversy in the team was around the selection in the triathlon but all is now resolved and two of our medal contenders, Tim Don and Jodie Swallow, have been lapping alongside the swimmers in the pool. Three-hour bike rides on the hot tarmac coupled with more work in the gym and the sea is exhausting just to watch, but the ideal preparation for one of the Games most gruelling sports. The other team members join them in the next couple of days and like everyone else will find that adapting to the stifling heat will be their first priority. Similarly, some of our track and field athletes have been arriving over the past couple of days although they are much less evident as a group. The distance mob head off to their own camp in the hills while Darren Campbell has opted for his own venue just down the coast. But as the swimmers head out to Athens today the void they leave behind will quickly be filled by the much maligned athletes. These last few days in such comfortable and relaxing surroundings will hopefully help to wash away some of the negativity and it wouldn't be a bad idea to lock one or two of the athletes in a room with Bill Sweetenham for a few minutes. I'm off to Athens now as ready as I can be for whatever they throw at me. My first event is on Saturday. It could be a tough one. We're up against Match of the Day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
