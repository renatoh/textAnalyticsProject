Menton's 18-month tenure was brought to an undignified close after an independent inquiry, commissioned by the FAI to investigate the circumstances surrounding Keane's split from Ireland's World Cup squad, acknowledged that the Manchester United captain had justifiable grievances about the association's preparations. The report incorporated 20 pages of recommendations and stated that the FAI had \"learned nothing\" from its two previous World Cup campaigns and had \"no culture of discipline\". The association, it concluded, was under-staffed, under-resourced and lacking organisation. Keane's sympathisers will see that as vindicating his complaints before the now infamous row with McCarthy that led to him flying home from Saipan, the Pacific island where the Irish squad was based before the tournament. He accused the FAI of undermining the team's chances, saying it was like \"playing for the Dog and Duck\". The report supported most of Keane's arguments, concluding that Ireland's achieve ments in reaching the second round, eventually losing to Spain in a penalty shoot-out, had come \"despite the FAI rather than because of it\". Menton, who will remain at the FAI in a vastly reduced role, said: \"There is clearly a need for radical change. Our structure is totally inappropriate and we have become crisis-prone. I feel my resignation will accelerate the process of change.\" The FAI, already charged with finding a successor for McCarthy, will head-hunt a chief executive. The job of general secretary will be abolished. Other officials implicated in the report are expected to leave in the next few weeks before the association starts the complicated process of trying to persuade Keane to resurrect his international career and usher in a new era. Rangers and Celtic have made concessions to Scotland's other 10 Premier League clubs in an attempt to end their dispute over the distribution of television money. The clubs meet on Friday to discuss the latest Old Firm proposals. In a new, detailed document sent to the clubs Rangers and Celtic say they will accept an 8-4 voting structure on a number of issues instead of the current 11-1. But the early indications are that it will not be enough to produce a settlement and that talks about the 10 clubs' already proposed breakaway will be brought higher up the agenda at Friday's meeting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
