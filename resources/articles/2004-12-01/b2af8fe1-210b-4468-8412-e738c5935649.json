The massive feeling of relief among the visiting players and their supporters in the 17,000 crowd was understandable after the fly-half's drop-goal in the fourth minute of injury-time secured their victory in a tense but uninspiring match. This was Northampton's first win at the 10th time of asking in the Zurich Premiership, an alarming run that followed two wins from two at the start of the season. Drahm's right boot swung the points in their direction. He started the day on the bench but, following Grayson's admission at half-time that he felt he should be substituted, Drahm was thrown into the fray and he provided immediate results. He kicked three late penalties to haul the Saints back to within two points of their hosts as the match entered injury-time and then, with the clock ticking down, picked up a horrid pass from around his ankles before heaving over the drop-goal that brought to an end Northampton's worst ever run of league results. \"It was an awkward ball for him and it looked like a lame duck going over,\" said Budge Pountney, Grayson's co-coach. \"But it made it.\" At the moment that will do for Northampton. It was a sweet win for the Saints against an Irish team who are archetypal mid-table scrappers. Recent games at the Madejski have not been classics and this was no exception. Irish have an excellent line-out, perhaps the Premiership's best, and they press hard at the breakdown. And then they have Mark Mapletoft. The peroxide fly-half kicked 18 of Irish's 21 points, a haul that included three second-half drop goals. The third of those took the Exiles out to 18-10 but it never felt a decisive lead because Irish had looked so unlikely, even unwilling, to score a try. It is difficult to remember the last Premiership try scored at the Madejski that owed anything to constructive approach play - and memories were certainly not jogged yesterday. Mapletoft did lay on the one try-scoring pass of the match but he gave it to Northampton, when the scrum-half Mark Robinson snatched his inside pass from virtually out of the hands of Paul Sackey and scurried home from the halfway line just before the break. That try apart, it had been an attritional battle that was dictated by the kickers. Grayson landed a penalty and converted Robinson's try to give Northampton a 10-9 advantage at the break before handing over the duties to Drahm. It was clearly the best decision he has made during his brief coaching career.
