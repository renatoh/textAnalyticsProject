It may have been the Supreme Novice Hurdle, the first race of the meeting, rather than the Champion, but for thousands of punters it was a good second-best. JP McManus travelled to Cheltenham yesterday with two items on his list of things to do: watch Istabraq, and back Like-A-Butterfly. Many more smaller punters took the hint, and the result was a gamble which took \u00a31 million out of the ring. It was what the Festival needed after its two years away, and another reminder of what we missed when Istabraq and the rest were denied a run 12 months ago. Reliable sources in the betting ring suggested afterwards that McManus's personal investment on Like-A-Butterfly was \u00a3100,000 at 9-4. In all, there was probably four or five times as much riding on her shoulders. Small wonder then that the grandstands dissolved into deafening bedlam as she galloped up the hill with Westender in close pursuit. Tony McCoy, on Westender, urged his mount forward as only he can, but Swan coaxed enough from the mare to hold him off by a neck. There was a sense of disbelief in the run-up to the Festival, that no one would be sure it was back until they had seen the horses for themselves. After this finish, one which kept hearts pound ing for 20 minutes afterwards, there could be no doubt. Yet the glee might well have been down in the betting ring had Adamant Approach, who was alongside the winner and apparently going better, not fallen at the final flight. \"I was confident going into the race but not going to the last,\" Christy Roche, Like-A-Butterfly's trainer, said. \"You never like to see a horse fall, but I wasn't too sorry to see Adamant Approach go. I'm sure that there will be lots of discussions about where she goes and where she doesn't with JP in the evening.\" Like-A-Butterfly is now unbeaten in eight outings, but even though she is eight years old she could still improve as she did not see a track until last year. The Tote quotes her at 10-1 for next year's Champion Hurdle. For McCoy, it was the first reverse of a miserable day, and he was second again half an hour later. Seebald went into the Arkle Trophy unbeaten in seven starts this season, but while he duly accounted for his British opponents, he was no match for Jessica Harrington's Moscow Flyer. The winner had fallen in two of his five chases before yesterday, and the Arkle is a race which does not forgive mistakes, but here his jumping was flawless. \"I couldn't believe how well he was going at the top of the hill,\" Harrington said, \"and he had jumped so well that I wasn't even worried as he jumped the last two.\" Barry Geraghty, Moscow Flyer's jockey, is one of Ireland's leading riders, but he was winning at the Festival for the first time. He milked every moment as they led him back. \"I got settled down the back and he jumped brilliantly,\" Geraghty said. \"When Tony came upsides me going to the second last I took a little peek, gave mine a little squeeze and I knew I had him.\" Frenchman's Creek was the day's other major winner, in the William Hill Handicap Chase, and may now run in the Grand National, for which he was cut to 16-1 from 40-1 with Ladbrokes. \"We'll see how he is and think about it before deciding,\" his trainer Hughie Morrison said. \"He was always just hacking around really.\" Nicky Henderson joined Martin Pipe as the leading current trainer at the Festival with 25 career winners when The Bushkeeper took the Kim Muir, while his other runner in the amateurs' race, Ceanannas Mor, finished second. Modesty prevailed in the aftermath, though. \"If you fire enough bullets,\" he said, \"you hope to hit the target sometimes.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
