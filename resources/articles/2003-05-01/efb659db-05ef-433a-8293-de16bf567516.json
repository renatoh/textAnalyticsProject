In Athens, thousands of protesters burned flags and chanted antiwar slogans outside the US embassy. At least 7,000 people joined the demonstration through the city centre, where hundreds of riot police guarded the embassy and other sites. There were no reports of clashes. But trouble flared in Berlin, where 29 riot police were injured by rock-throwing demonstrators in the early hours of today, ahead of the main marches through the city. A Berlin police spokesman said the violence erupted shortly before midnight in a park in the eastern district of Prenzlauer Berg. He said demonstrators threw rocks, bottles and even shot fireworks at the helmet-clad police. A number of people at a nearby open air concert were also injured. A total of 97 people were detained, police said, during violence that lasted several hours. There were a further 74 arrests in Hamburg following scuffles with police at a protest by about 500 people. There were also violent incidents in Madrid and bloodshed in Istanbul, where Turkish riot police moved in to break up an unauthorised march, arresting 40 people. In Bulgaria, about 5,000 supporters of the opposition Socialist party gathered for a protest calling on the conservative government to resign for what they said was its failure to improve the country's dismal living standards. There were more peaceful scenes in Moscow, where thousands of people across the country gathered for May Day marches and rallies reminiscent of the Soviet era. Under sunny skies, the Federation of Independent Trade Unions and the pro-presidential United Russia party held rallies in the Russian capital. Marchers demanded an increase in wages, higher student stipends and improved social services. During Soviet times, tens of thousands of Russians would flood Red Square when May 1 was one of the most important dates on the ceremonial calendar to mark their solidarity with workers around the world. However, opinion polls showed that for most in modern-day Russia, the day was being celebrated primarily as a day off work, to be spent catching up with friends and family. Russia's Public Opinion Foundation found that only 4% of Russians planned to participate in marches or rallies this year. China was forced to cancel its week-long International Workers celebration, one of the biggest events in the nation's calendar, due to fears over the spread of the Sars virus. In South Korea, however, celebrations went ahead as normal, with tens of thousands of red flag-waving workers filling the streets of Seoul. In Cyprus, people from both sides of the line that divides the Greek and Turkish-speaking communities celebrated May Day together for the first time in 30 years. Amid jubilant scenes, the demonstrators urged Turkey to end the occupation of northern Cyprus and called for a reunification of the island. The celebrations became possible as tens of thousands of people continued to cross the border after Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash lifted a ban on Turkish Cypriots visiting across the United Nations buffer zone splitting the island."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
