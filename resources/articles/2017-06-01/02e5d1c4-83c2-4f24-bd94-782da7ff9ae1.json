Reports have suggested the Premier League has discussed the addition of a 7.45pm slot on Saturday evenings from the 2019-20 season, which would increase the number of live games when the next broadcasting deal is negotiated. The FSF accepts that while \u201cfans are pragmatic\u201d, further disruption to travel plans could put many off making the journey and damage the atmosphere and \u201cEnglish passion\u201d the television companies highlight when marketing their product. A statement from the FSF read: \u201cToo many games are already broadcast at times which make life difficult for match-going fans, with those having the longest journeys hit especially hard. Broadcasters are reliant on the atmosphere generated by supporters which goes a long, long way to creating their attractive TV \u2018product\u2019. \u201cHow do empty stands look? Yet broadcasters and the Premier League seem intent on scheduling games at times which are increasingly difficult for fans to get to. \u201cFans are pragmatic and realise games must be broadcast. The Kick-Off Times Working Group was set up under the auspices of the FSF and features supporters\u2019 trusts from Chelsea, Liverpool and Spurs. \u201cThey met with BT Sport only a matter of months ago \u2013 at no point did BT Sport mention 7.45pm kick offs and the silence from them has been deafening ever since. Now they are reported as being the driving force behind it all. Where was the consultation with representative, match-going fans when they had the chance? It isn\u2019t good enough.\u201d Sky and BT Sport were awarded the previous three-year domestic broadcasting rights for the Premier League, which are worth \u00a35.14bn. BT Sport stressed the broadcaster had not made any push towards adding a late Saturday slot when the rights come up for auction again. A BT statement read: \u201cBT Sport did meet with the Kick-Off Times Working Group recently and 7.45pm Saturday kick-off times were not discussed. We are not the \u2018driving force behind it all\u2019. \u201cSimon Green, head of BT Sport, was recently at the KPMG Football Benchmark event where he was asked about the future of Premier League football and said that the Premier League could always learn from other sports and leagues, including more access and better scheduling going forward. He did not suggest any specific kick-off times \u2013 the Premier League and clubs dictate this.\u201d At the end of the 2016-17 campaign, a report produced by members of the Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur Supporters\u2019 Trusts reviewed the impact on fans of matches rearranged at the request of broadcasters and those scheduled for midweek slots by the Premier League. The report and related analysis produced a series of recommendations which were set to be circulated to both the Premier League and broadcasters in advance of meetings with supporters\u2019 groups. The recommendations included a review to increase the minimum notice period of six weeks for Premier League match kick-off time rearrangement, better planning of fixtures involving clubs at opposite ends of the country to minimise the impact on travelling fans and working with train companies over special services as well as automatic subsidised travel in a continuation of the Away Supporters Initiative, which saw a ticket price cap of \u00a330. As part of the agreement with the regulator Ofcom, at least 190 Premier League matches per season are to be broadcast in the UK from 2019-20, up from 168."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
