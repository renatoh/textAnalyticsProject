An appalling start to Euro 2004 ensured that McCarthy and Roy Keane, names which are inexorably linked, were again the issue of the day. A tame surrender in Moscow, in context perhaps the worst performance and most disappointing result of McCarthy's six-year reign, would have been unthinkable in the previous two seasons during which Keane inspired Ireland to dogged and outrageous success. The Manchester United man's self-imposed absence was not a matter McCarthy would have expected to avoid after such a result but the manager hardly needed the FAI to catapult the subject to the forefront of attention. Hours after the defeat, Irish officials - perhaps seeking to curry favour with a public still generally pro-Keane - announced that he would be welcome to resume his international career, albeit only with the approval of the manager. That statement prompted inevitable questions at Moscow's Sheremetevo airport yesterday and an equally predictable exit by an irritated McCarthy. \"The situation is not something that is going to change,\" he said before bringing the press conference to an abrupt conclusion. \"That situation is far beyond repair. Roy has told everybody that and I am getting on with the team I have got. I am not going to worry about people who aren't here.\" McCarthy must thus battle through this campaign with the resources at his disposal and, even allowing for the fact that Damien Duff, one of his best players, was lost after 18 minutes to a thigh strain, that is a worrying notion. \"If we beat them in Dublin this result is finished with and it's all down to how we do against the other teams in the group,\" said McCarthy, defending his players with more resolution than they did the Irish goal at the Lokomotiv stadium. \"In the past, playing the big guns has helped us [but] it didn't this time. We have never defended like that. But when you look at how these players have performed in the past, you can see why I am not getting mad at them.\" In truth, for a McCarthy team this was an error-strewn performance. Steve Finnan's misjudgment after 20 minutes let the impressive Andrey Karyaka to slip past him for the first goal then Clinton Morrison lost the ball at the start of the move that saw Vladimir Beschastnykh score five minutes later. The new captain Kenny Cunningham misread a ball for Alexander Kerzhakov's header for Russia's third and the substitute Phil Babb completed the sorry evening three minutes from time, unwittingly deflecting the ball into his own net after Shay Given had saved from Kerzhakov. Twice Ireland pulled back to within a goal in the second half, first through Gary Doherty's convincing 68th minute header and Morrison's close-range shot six minutes later. However, the fact that Doherty's goal preceded Kerzhakov's free header by only a minute snuffed out any hope of another trademark Irish comeback. Russia (3-3-2-2): Ovchinnikov; Nizhegorodov, Onopko, Ignashevitch; Yanovski, Aldonin, Loskov; Gusev (Solomatin, 29), Karyaka; Semak (Khokhlov, 74), Beschastnykh (Kerzhakov, 46). Ireland (4-4-2): Given (Newcastle Utd); Finnan (Fulham), Breen (West Ham), Cunningham (Birmingham), Harte (Leeds Utd); McAteer (Sunderland; Doherty , Tottenham, 65), Kinsella (Aston Villa), Holland (Ipswich), Kilbane (Sunderland; Babb, Sunderland, 85); Keane (Leeds Utd), Duff (Blackburn; Morrison , Birmingham, 18).
