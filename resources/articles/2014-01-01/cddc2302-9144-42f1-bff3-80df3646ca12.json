While President Obama's State of the Union address isn't likely to unite Congress or introduce a course of action on pressing issues, the night has historically been a way for Americans to watch political theatre unfold in real-time during prime-time. Paul and Dan will be snapping photos throughout the evening on the Guardian Instagram account. Find their updates by visiting the page here or by following #GuardianCam on Instagram or Twitter.
