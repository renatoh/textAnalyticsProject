The Arsenal full-back's form has been indifferent at best and the coach is hoping to exploit that with the help of Wilhelmsson, who has arguably been Sweden's best player, having caused havoc down the right against both Trinidad &amp; Tobago and Paraguay. Tonight, the 26-year-old Anderlecht winger is hoping to do the same against England. \"I know that a point will be enough for us but it is very difficult to go out there and play for a draw,\" he said. \"You can easily concede a goal if you start with that mindset. We have got to go out and play our game, we have to use a lot of variation to open them up and work hard. I think we could surprise England with our set-pieces, but we still have to improve on them.\" Wilhelmsson is the maverick of the Sweden squad, completely un-Swedish with his combination of impressive technique and uninhibited attacking instincts. Before the tournament he was expected to play against T&amp;T and Paraguay and then step aside for a more defensive player but his performances - and the fact that Sweden wants a point - means he should keep his place. \"I can't do more than I have done so far,\" he says. \"It has worked really well with Niclas [Alexandersson] at right-back. I know I will probably be up against Joe Cole and he is a very good and skilful player. They have a lot of big names in their midfield but it has to work [playing together] as well. It is what you do on the pitch that counts.\" Wilhelmsson, who has been linked with moves to Tottenham, Paris St-Germain and Fiorentina and is expected to leave Belgium after the World Cup, is addicted to football, which is rivalled in his affections only by his pet parrot Konjak. \"I always want to have a football near me,\" he said recently. \"When I was living in Norway I used to pick up the ball and keep it in the air as I went downstairs and out to pick up the post, just to improve my technique. The first times I did it, I saw the neighbours look out through to the windows and just shake their heads. They probably wondered what kind of an idiot I was. But they were nice about it. They still talked to me.\" His girlfriend Caroline Hakansson, meanwhile, has to battle the ball for attention. \"It is just getting worse and worse,\" she said with a smile. \"He is with a ball all day. Sometimes it can get too much and it has even gone so far that I have thrown out some balls, but they always come back in. It appears that his priorities are like this: first the football, then his parrot and then me. I tried to say that I was allergic to the bird but it didn't work and with the football I realise that I haven't got a chance.\" It was his technique and pace which prompted Anderlecht to sign him from the Norwegian club Stabaek in 2003 and he has won two titles in three years in Belgium. He never played in the top division in Sweden, leaving his homeland for Norway six years ago, but has become one of the most popular players in the country - partly because of his passionate support for his hometown club Mjallby. Last summer, Wilhelmsson was reported to the Swedish FA for jumping over the fence and onto the pitch to accost the referee after a Mjallby game. Wilhelmsson called the official \"a plonker\" and said that he had been \"bloody awful\". \"I just felt sorry for the lads, who deserved a point,\" he explained. \"Jumping over the fence was perhaps taking it a bit too far but referees should be able to take some criticism. They can say what they want about us players all the time.\" The only concern for the Swedes at the moment is his hairstyle, which could do grave damage to the nation's reputation. He is sporting a 20cm rat's tail which has had his team-mates, fans and the country's hairdressers scratching their heads. \"It is for a special reason,\" he said. \"It is not because I used to adore Roberto Baggio, I can tell you that. I might sell it on eBay and give the money to charity but I won't tell you why I've got it just yet, let's wait until after the final in Berlin on July 9.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
