It is not yet known if he has spoken to the newly appointed Newcastle manager, Sam Allardyce, but a source close to him said his intention was not to \"hamper\" football matters - \"He is not going to get in the way of transfers and such like, far from it.\" Stressing the ambition of Ashley, the source added: \"He is someone putting a huge amount of money into the club and he does not want this season, a big opportunity and an important season, to be hampered in any way.\" Allardyce appears to be operating as might be expected. He called at the England B team hotel on Wednesday night to speak face-to-face for the first time with Michael Owen and also to talk to Kieron Dyer. That suggests it will be business as usual for the team but a smooth passage to full control for Ashley is not guaranteed. Offer documents go out to other shareholders within the coming fortnight, with Ashley's ultimate intention being to take the club off the stock market and back into private ownership. That will depend on the current chairman, Freddy Shepherd, selling his 29% stake and on those close to Shepherd, friends and business partners with minor stakes, doing the same. Shepherd remained in a Tyneside hospital yesterday but the noises from it were predictably defiant and he may derive some pleasure merely from frustrating Ashley, particularly if that impacts upon Sir John. Hall's part in Wednesday's events is galling to Shepherd, who has publicly taken the flak as chairman while Hall has retreated into the background. The two men were known to have disagreed over the timing of Sir Bobby Robson's dismissal - Hall wanted it to happen earlier - and have not been close for some time. But Hall's decision to go with Ashley was unforeseen by Shepherd and Hall now has to decide whether he will return to a public role under Ashley. The England midfield player Owen Hargreaves was at Manchester United's training ground at Carrington yesterday. Last night he had the first part of his medical with a view to completing his \u00a317m move from Bayern Munich to United. Martin Allen is set to be confirmed as Leicester City's manager today, with Milan Mandaric, the club's owner, ready to appoint the 41-year-old after overlooking Neil Warnock and Paul Ince. Leicester were granted permission to speak to the manager by Milton Keynes Dons this week and, after holding talks with Allen, who led the League Two club to fourth place this season only to lose in the play-off semi-finals, Mandaric decided to give the former West Ham United and Portsmouth player his first chance to manage at Championship level. Julio Baptista's return to Real Madrid after a season on loan at Arsenal, meanwhile, will not necessarily mean that Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes will return to north London. Reyes wants to remain in Spain and, although Real Madrid are unlikely to match Arsenal's asking price, Sevilla and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid are other possible options."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
