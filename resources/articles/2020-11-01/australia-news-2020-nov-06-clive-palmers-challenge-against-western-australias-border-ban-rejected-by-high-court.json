A majority of justices on Friday held that the state\u2019s quarantine directions and the emergency management law authorising them did not breach the constitution. The mining tycoon had argued the border directions infringed the guarantee that interstate trade, commerce and intercourse should be \u201cabsolutely free\u201d. The chief justice, Susan Kiefel, said the court had found the emergency laws \u2013 insofar as they deal with a \u201cplague or epidemic\u201d \u2013 comply with the constitution and the border closure \u201cdoes not raise\u201d constitutional questions. Kiefel also noted that Palmer\u2019s case did not argue that the border directions were not validly authorised by the emergency laws. The court ordered Palmer to pay costs. The Western Australian, Mark McGowan, welcomed the result as a \u201csignificant victory\u201d. \u201cI will always fight to protect the health of Western Australians,\u201d he said in a statement. McGowan told reporters in Perth that Palmer would likely be liable for \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of dollars in legal costs. Although no date has been set for the court to provide its reasons, the result demonstrates that the justices accepted that the directions were intended to prevent the spread of Covid-19 rather than discriminating against interstate movement. Despite the federal court finding the border ban was \u201csubstantially effective\u201d at preventing the reintroduction of coronavirus, Palmer had sought to argue it was not \u201creasonably necessary\u201d because WA could have opted for less restrictive alternatives. Western Australia countered that since justice Darryl Rangiah concluded the ban was \u201cthe most effective\u201d policy there were therefore \u201cno other measures available\u201d that were less restrictive of movement. Although Rangiah found some jurisdictions presented a low risk, the WA solicitor general, Joshua Thomson, argued that the risk was not zero and was worsened by the prospect of travellers \u201cborder hopping\u201d from higher risk areas. McGowan has announced WA will reopen to all states and territories from 14 November, with some restrictions remaining for residents of New South Wales and Victoria. WA\u2019s case was supported by other states and territories, which argued that it was entitled to a tighter border due to geographical differences and to pursue the aim of excluding the virus to a greater degree. After months of backing Palmer\u2019s challenge, the federal government pulled out of the case in August under sustained pressure from McGowan. Scott Morrison then asked Palmer to drop the case. The federal shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said the court\u2019s decision was a \u201chumiliating rebuff\u201d to the Morrison government\u2019s earlier attempt to support the case. \u201cThe people of WA will not forget this,\u201d he said. The Australian Industry Group chief executive, Innes Willox, warned the result \u201cshould not be seen as a green light to keep internal borders closed or restricted longer than necessary\u201d. Willox welcomed WA\u2019s decision to move to a \u201ccontrolled border\u201d with the majority of states and territories from 14 November but said there remained a \u201cconfused patchwork of restrictions that persist, sometimes unnecessarily, in our federation\u201d. Palmer has eight court actions against Western Australia and senior ministers, including a dispute over an iron ore project, a contempt of court case after WA passed a law to block that damages claim and a defamation case against the premier."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
