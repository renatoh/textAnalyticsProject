The Conservatives alleged that a flat in Clapham, owned by the RMT union and rented to the deputy prime minister, constituted a clash of interests at the heart of government. For the Tories, Tim Collins told the Commons there was a reference in the code of conduct of ministers that they needed to comply in full with the register of members' interests. He said: \"Is it not regrettable that the deputy prime minister himself has still failed to comply with the finding of the standards and privileges committee that he should register his RMT property connection? \"Will not many commuters believe that this government's spineless refusal to take action against this week's shameful rail strikes is connected with that link at the highest levels of the RMT union?\" Mr Prescott said this was not consistent with the facts. \"All three accusations investigated by standards commissioner Elizabeth Filkin, and indeed before the committee, were rejected. In those circumstances I was not required to register it,\" he said \"They invited me to do so. I talked to the chairman of the committee about this matter. Since I hadn't committed an offence, why then should I register it?\" he demanded. Three Tories lodged official complaints against Mr Prescott last year, saying he should have declared details of a flat in Clapham, south London, which they claimed was rented at a \"peppercorn\" rate from the RMT union at the time he was transport secretary. The Commons standards and privileges committee rejected all the complaints against Mr Prescott, but said it would be better for him to register the tenancy in the register of members' interests. The Labour-dominated committee turned down a recommendation by Mrs Filkin to uphold one complaint."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
