The Bulls had lost their first two Super League fixtures but against an out-gunned Castleford looked much more like the team their close-season signings suggested they would be. Orford and Kearney were the highest-profile of those signings, and this display suggested their partnership could bear fruit this year. Kearney scored two well-taken tries, while the organiser Orford created four and kicked 13 points. \"They were given a better platform by some of our forwards tonight,\" McNamara said. \"We asked for a response from the players and we got that in practice all week and again tonight.\" Castleford were below their recent form but were hardly helped by the absence of their scrum-half Brent Sherwin with a knee injury and the second-half loss of Richie Owen to a suspected broken leg. \"Physically we just weren't in the game,\" their coach, Terry Matterson, said. In contrast to the recent capitulation to St Helens, the Bulls stunned their opponents with four tries in the opening half-hour, including two in the first seven minutes from Nick Scruton and Rikki Sheriffe. By half-time, the young back-row Elliott Whitehead and Kearney had both crossed, with the Tigers just staying in touch through Michael Shenton and Owen. But Castleford were dealt a further blow when Owen left on a stretcher shortly after the restart and the game went completely away from them soon after. Orford was the architect, running on the last tackle before kicks from Sykes and Sheriffe led to Dave Halley's try. Orford then sent Kearney over for his second try, ensuring that two late Castleford efforts were scant consolation. Paul Sykes had the final word for the Bulls, who will be keen to build on this improvement in the coming weeks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
