Keane's side now boast the worst away record in the League, having claimed just two points on the road this season. 'They came with their autograph books,' said Keane with a grimace, 'and that's just not acceptable.' With Sunderland four points off the drop zone and facing a critical test at Pride Park next week, Keane has every justification to be concerned. 'You've got to bring something to the party,' he said with lament. 'We had absolutely nothing going forward today. David James must have had the easiest game of his career - they didn't even need a goalkeeper.' Keane was not over-egging things. In contrast, Harry Redknapp was 'delighted' with his side, although in truth they were only marginally better than Sunderland and it took a penalty decision to change the scoreline. Realists might say that a home side best known for their away form this season facing a visiting side most comfortable at home was always going to end in stalemate. But anyone watching this particular display would have felt disappointed by the lack of action. Andy Reid, making his first start for Sunderland, provided the best of the first-half entertainment as he hopped and skipped his way down the wing, frequently troubling Glen Johnson. Reid's free-kick, early on, hinted at a display that failed to materialise. Sunderland called for a penalty when Daryl Murphy's shot hit Sol Campbell's arm in the box, but referee Phil Dowd - standing next to the defender - waved play on. Portsmouth did drive forward, but despite playing two strikers up front they could not convert any positive play. A lovely sequence from the home side came as Johnson's run was aided by a flick-on from Milan Baros, continuing with a great ball across goal for Jermain Defoe, but the former Tottenham striker could not reach to turn the ball home. Sulley Muntari came close with a free-kick and Hermann Hreidarsson threatened with a header, but there was nothing to suggest that Portsmouth might take the victory. The second half began with better intent from the home side. A mean free-kick from Niko Kranjcar was bravely headed away by Phil Bardsley, and from the resulting corner Hreidarsson made a furious appeal, claiming his shirt had been pulled in the area. For the most part, though, it was a miserable display. Kranjcar overhit his passes, Baros frequently lost concentration and Defoe could not seem to find his touch. The introduction of Kanu, for Baros, helped and soon after Portsmouth won themselves a penalty. Kranjcar, racing into the area, drew a weak foul from Bardsley and promptly hit the turf. Defoe happily stepped up to bag his second league goal for Portsmouth, and with it the so-called 'confidence player' hit a run of energy. Driving forward, he linked well with Kranjcar, finishing the move with a shot that had Scotland keeper Craig Gordon fumbling for the ball after a spillage. A brilliant turn in the box followed after a decent ball in from Johnson, and the diminutive striker once again carved out an effort. Redknapp insisted he was happy with his side's efforts, but if Portsmouth follow up with a performance like that against Manchester United in 13 days' time they will surely be out of the FA Cup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
