Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the UK was at a crossroads and faced a stark choice between years of spiralling inequality and low wages and a fairer, more prosperous society \"built on decent jobs\" and a fairer split between wages and profits.. But amid growing tension between the trade union movement and the Labour party, she said Miliband, who will address the TUC congress next week, had the capacity to transform society on the same scale as Margaret Thatcher did in the 1980s if he could muster enough political courage. \"He has put living standards on the agenda, he made the right call on Leveson, he made the right call, in my view, on Syria \u2013 when push comes to shove Miliband rises to the occasion and has set out a direction for the country,\" she said. O'Grady's conciliatory tone follows a difficult summer for Miliband, during which he was widely criticised for failing to define what his party stood for and became ensnared in a bitter dispute with Labour's main union backer, Unite. This week brought a further blow when the UK's third largest union, the GMB, announced it was slashing its funding to the party. However, O'Grady played down the possibility of a lasting split between Labour and the trade unions, saying she did not believe the wider labour movement had any appetite to break the link. \"I don't have a crystal ball but I don't think that link will get broken,\" she said. \"It seems to me that over history that link has changed, evolved, it is bound to, it is not written in stone, but the important thing is that it is there.\" She said the challenge now for Miliband was to inspire people, and she called on him to look to the vision of Britain set out by Danny Boyle in the opening ceremony of the London Olympics. \"Are we going to go down the role of the US where big money gets to call the shots or are we going to be returned to the sorts of values that Danny Boyle displayed at the Olympics, where we say we do have to look after each other, we do have to accept that sometimes people have bad luck, lose their jobs, fall on hard times. We do need to invest in decent homes for the future, we do need to get our young people back to work. It is a very big choice we are facing.\" O'Grady called on Miliband and his team to kickstart the fight for the next election when he speaks to union activists at the TUC conference on Tuesday. \"I am not expecting huge [policy] detail but I think we do need that compelling story and [the speech] needs to give people confidence that we are not just describing the problems, we need [to hear] that they are prepared to tackle them and to square up to some powerful interests. \"They have got to use plain language and they have got to inspire people \u2026 the biggest enemy is indifference or people feeling all politicians are all the same \u2013 they have got to [persuade] people that a new Labour government can make a difference to their lives.\" Last year's TUC conference voted to look into the practicalities of organising a general strike in protest at government spending cuts. A similar call for a general strike is expected to be tabled this year. But O'Grady played down that possibility, saying people were more focused on tackling a \"dramatic nosedive\" in living standards, falling wages and rising profits. \"The motion last year asked the TUC to consider the practicalities of a general strike. The general council has considered those practicalities which do include threats to sequestration of funds, sacking of workers and repudiation of activists and we will be reporting to congress accordingly. But I think what most people are focusing on is the real ballots we have got going, which do have a just cause \u2026 these are the real issues.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
