Obviously, Turkey should get what it needs. But this has become a charged debate, because it is a proxy for another more fundamental argument: whether our allies should be expected merely to accede to American policy. The question of war in Iraq has turned into far too personal a dispute over American leadership. The French, who are leading the rebellion, are showing poor judgment. But the fault lies as well with the Bush administration's destructive \"with us or against us\" approach, which is being foolishly applied to some of our most important allies. Nato meets again today to consider a more narrowly-drawn Turkish request that would allow the alliance to provide Turkey with the help it needs while deferring larger questions of diplomatic strategy on Iraq. That approach deserves unanimous transatlantic support. New York Times (registration required) New York Post (US) The arrogant leaders of France have clearly forgotten the sacrifices Americans made here in Ste Mere Eglise. They might take a short break from their favourite pastime, stabbing America in the back as it prepares to rid the world of Saddam Hussein, and talk to Howard Manoian. He'd be happy to remind them how he and his friends saved France from Adolf Hitler. Those guys had true grit. They were men of war. And men of honour. The turncoats making policy in Paris and Berlin don't know the meaning of the word. Howard, 76, a former cop from Lowell, Mass, and Derry, NH, remembers why our young men went to war. \"France was in trouble, and all of us had to do something about it. Simple as that.\" He has lived here for 18 years. Why did he settle in this town? \"I feel I was baptised here. OK, it was under fire, but this is where I was baptised.\" And what does he say to those who no longer care what happened back then? \"With this anti-American thing going on, I tell people loud and clear, I'm an American, first and last. You got a problem? I think we all did our bit back then.\" Take note, appeasers and apologists for terror. New York Post San Francisco Chronicle (US) The Bush administration must attend seriously to the strain in the Atlantic alliance, which was aggravated by defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld's offensive dismissal of the \"old Europe\". The US, even as the lone superpower, needs these old democratic friends in a world where the war against terrorism is far from won, and may or may not have much to do with the threat of Hussein's arsenal. Almost a week after secretary of state Colin Powell's presentation to the UN security council of our government's case against Hussein, ambiguities remain in the record about Iraq's real intentions. The chief inspectors will make an updated report on Friday about Iraqi cooperation, and that could bend further security council deliberation in the direction of more diplomacy, or toward the use of force. This is a moment for the US to be persuading its allies, not alienating them. San Francisco Chronicle Washington Post (US) France and Germany have finally responded to Iraq's flagrant violation of UN disarmament orders by mounting an offensive. Yet the target of their campaign is not Saddam Hussein, but the US, and the proximate casualties look to be not the power structures of a rogue dictator but the international institutions that have anchored European and global security. Yesterday in Brussels, the two European governments, seconded by tiny Belgium, blocked the Nato alliance from making preparations to defend Turkey in the event of a war, even though the planning was supported by the alliance's 16 other members. That their slogans are being mimicked by Baghdad's thugs ought to trouble French President Jacques Chirac and the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. And perhaps they would be uneasy if their priorities were to eliminate the threat posed by Saddam Hussein, restore the credibility of Nato and the security council, and steer the Bush administration into a multilateral approach to global security. More and more, however, the two leaders behave as if they share the same overriding goal as the Iraqi dictator: thwarting US action even when it is supported by most other Nato and European nations. They have next to no chance of succeeding, but could poison international relations for years to come. Washington Post Economist (UK) After the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001, a new role for Nato seemed to emerge, as a bulwark against global terrorism. The subsequent war in Afghanistan was not officially a Nato operation, though most member countries sent troops. The alliance is growing - seven former Eastern Bloc countries will join next year, and three Balkan nations have been invited to apply - but bigger will not necessarily mean stronger. Eastern Europe is as split as the west, with Russia (a Nato observer) apparently leaning towards the Franco-German line while Poland (a full member since 1999) recently joined Britain and six other countries in signing a letter backing America's position. Lord Robertson says he hopes that, as Nato members consider how serious are the implications of failing to overcome their split over Turkey, this will give them the impetus to reach a solution. But much damage has already been done. Economist Moscow Times (Russia) Events long ago acquired their own momentum. Even if Washington has misgivings about the path it has chosen, the Rubicon has been crossed. Bush and Hussein are both bound by their previous decisions. Neither can change course now without admitting defeat. Both sides will, therefore, rush headlong into conflict, regardless of the real reasons that led them to this point. The modern era has seen only one case when countries on the brink of war managed to step back and rein in their military machines: the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962. But the leaders facing off back then were Nikita Khrushchev and John F Kennedy. Today, all we've got are Dubya and Saddam. Moscow Times Canberra Times (Australia) US Secretary of State Colin Powell did a good job at the United Nations on Wednesday of laying out the evidence that Saddam Hussein has kept some of the chemical and biological weapons that he had before the Gulf War of 1990-91, and maybe even made more since then. If you doubted it before, then you shouldn't doubt it any more. But it was the right answer to the wrong question. Saddam should be forced to comply with his obligations and destroy all those weapons, but if you are planning to launch a war next month that will probably snuff out tens of thousands of lives, then you have to answer a different question. Is there a big enough risk that Saddam will use those weapons himself in the near future, or give them to terrorists to use, to justify pulling the inspectors out and killing all those people now? No, there is not. Canberra Times"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
