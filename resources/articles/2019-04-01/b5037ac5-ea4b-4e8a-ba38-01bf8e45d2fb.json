The FBI arrested Larry Mitchell Hopkins, 69, for alleged unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition , days after his group posted videos that appeared to show armed men stopping migrants at the border in New Mexico, ordering them to sit on the ground and coordinating with US border patrol agents to have them taken into custody. \u201cToday\u2019s arrest by the FBI indicates clearly that the rule of law should be in the hands of trained law enforcement officials, not armed vigilantes,\u201d the New Mexico attorney general, Hector Balderas, said in a statement. On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) called for an investigation into the pro-Trump, anti-immigrant men who have been patrolling the border and calling themselves the United Constitutional Patriots (UCP). The ACLU in New Mexico described the group as \u201can armed fascist militia organization\u201d made up of \u201cvigilantes\u201d, saying they were working to \u201ckidnap and detain people seeking asylum\u201d and had directly made illegal arrests and held migrants at gunpoint. Hopkins\u2019 role in the group was unclear, and it was also not clear if he was facing any charges directly related to the videos of the men stopping migrants. The New Mexico attorney general\u2019s office described Hopkins as a \u201cdangerous felon who should not have weapons around children and families\u201d and labeled him an \u201carmed individual detaining migrants at the border\u201d. An FBI statement on the arrest did not mention the militia group or the detention of migrants, but noted that Hopkins has also gone by the name Johnny Horton Jr and that he was due to appear in court on Monday. In one video posted last Monday night by Jim Benvie, a member of the armed group, it appeared the men were ordering around dozens of migrants, including many children, and telling them to sit. Benvie narrated: \u201cThere\u2019s no border patrol here. This is us.\u201d The men appeared to call border patrol agents, who later were seen. The ACLU, in a letter to state officials, said the group had targeted nearly 300 migrants in Sunland Park, New Mexico, which is along the Mexico border and adjacent to El Paso, Texas. The militia members advocated for Trump\u2019s proposed border wall on the video streams and echoed the president\u2019s anti-migrant rhetoric, warning of an \u201cinvasion\u201d. There have also been concerns that the men, who wear military-style clothes, could be misrepresenting themselves as border patrol agents. In another video, Benvie filmed himself stopping a group of four adults and three children and said \u201cborder patrol\u201d as he approached, before calling for another member of his group to join him. In an apparent call to border patrol, one man said: \u201cHello, I\u2019ve got seven over here.\u201d The UCP has previously presented itself as a group of \u201cvolunteers\u201d aiding border patrol and supporting Trump. In recent years, there have been numerous reports of an increase in paramilitary groups and xenophobic activists surveilling the border, working with US agents and targeting undocumented people. The UCP has not responded to the Guardian\u2019s requests for comment. On Thursday, a Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said border patrol \u201cwelcomes assistance from the community\u201d but \u201cdoes not endorse private groups or organizations taking enforcement matters into their own hands\u201d. The Daily Beast reported that Hopkins has a history of pushing far-right conspiracies and has a conviction for impersonating an officer and felony firearm possession. He could not be reached on Saturday and it was not immediately clear if he had a lawyer. Stephanie Corte, an immigrant rights campaign strategist with the ACLU in New Mexico, said her group was still trying to make contact with the detained migrants and was uncertain if any had been released. \u201cOur next focus is to try to get their story and making sure they feel safe to tell their story of being held at gunpoint,\u201d she told the Guardian, adding that the ACLU would explore legal options. She said she hoped authorities would work to make sure this does not happen again. \u201cWe absolutely believe that this was completely unlawful,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping those involved will be brought to justice.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
