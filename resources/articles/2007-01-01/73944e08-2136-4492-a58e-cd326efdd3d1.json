She's only in the Big Brother house, of course, because she violates every single stereotype of the good mother. Jackiey (sic) Budden skinned up with Jade when the lass was four, gave her her first joint at five, and punched one of Jade's teachers as well as another mother. Bring on the parade of the damaged and the dysfunctional: they're so amusing-revolting. But most intriguing is the relationship between mother and daughter. Daughter has said that she's not enjoying being in the Big Brother house, because her mother's there: she feels like an adult looking after her kid. Mother has said, \"I don't regret bringing Jade up in the way we did. We are best mates. We used to go raving together - me, Jade and all her friends.\" It sends a chill through me, the \"best mates\" routine. In a magazine feature last year, mothers, all long tresses and Botoxed faces, ages obviously withheld, purred about how well they got on with their teen and post-teen daughters, shared the same taste in clothes and music, \"everyone thinks we're sisters\" (aka \"don't I look young?\"). Elsewhere, Sarah Ferguson describes herself and her daughters as \"Tripod. We are totally, utterly connected every way. The way we look. The way we move.\" Says Princess Beatrice, \"I see myself as a mini-Mummy.\" What's wrong with them all? Don't they know that the First Duty of the Teenager's Parent is not to cosy up to them but embarrass them? Partly, of course, it's a fashion thing. You can no longer tell the age of a woman, or indeed a man, just by looking at them. They may have \"had things done\". And their clothes? As a teenager in the 1960s I would sooner have eaten my purple velvet hotpants than worn anything my (actually rather stylish) mother did. She took me to the very first Biba shop, and the more she laughed in disbelief as I tried on dresses with arms so tight that they threatened to cut off my blood supply (and I was a sylph), the more determined I was to buy them. But women like me now think nothing of shopping for ourselves in Topshop alongside our daughters. And then we're shocked to find them trying to sneak our favourite silver jacket out of the house without us noticing ... Being best friends with your children is bad on all kinds of counts. It's bad for parents because it usually means that we're trying to be younger than we really are - still raving after all these years. It's also hard to exert adult authority if you're hanging out with the kids, and want their approval. And, for God's sake, why do their children want to have them along? Teenagerhood is a crucial passage in the separation from parents. Kids find out who they are, as opposed to who their parents want them to be. Trying to be best buddies with your children doesn't help them achieve this essential developmental task, and may also hold the parent back from advancing to a life where they're no longer so entwined with their child's. There's something else that's disturbing. In the MTV programme Date My Mom, a young man goes on a date with three mothers before deciding which of their (unseen) daughters he's going to take out. You see the mothers rooting for their girls but also proxy flirting (I call the programme Pimp My Daughter), flattered by the attentions of a young man - and not entirely on their daughter's behalf. We know that Oedipal conflicts get reignited during adolescence, and the development of teenage sexuality often produces powerful feelings and anxieties, in both both parents and children. Yet how can these be properly experienced if both sides are trying so hard to be best friends? Jade may no longer be a teenager, but still I yell at her and Jackiey, \"Get a life. Separately.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
