The first prize of \u00a3337,000 went to the Barry Hills-trained Silk Blossom, the mount of Michael Hills, who gave evidence at yesterday's hearing. Wait Watcher, ridden by Tadhg O'Shea, drifted left in the closing stages of the race and the interference caused to Silk Blossom was deemed sufficient for the placings to be reversed. The decision was a costly blow to the connections of Wait Watcher, who picked up \u00a3102,000 as runner-up. \"We felt we had grounds to appeal, but we just have to accept the decision and get on with life,\" said Blockley yesterday. \"We had a fair hearing. Now we'll let the filly do the talking. She goes to Milan for a Group race on Sunday week.\" The field for tomorrow week's Champion Stakes at Newmarket is starting to take shape, and yesterday Multidimensional was backed to put his trainer, Henry Cecil, back on the Group One scene. Coral cut the Niarchos family-owned colt to 16-1 from 25-1 following confirmation that he would be supplemented at a cost of \u00a324,000. Multidimensional won a Group Two event at Deauville last time for Cecil, whose last Group One success came with Beat Hollow in the 2000 Grand Prix de Paris. Ouija Board is also on course for the Champion Stakes, and Hurricane Run may bid to leave his disappointing Arc running behind at Newmarket. Sir Percy, Coral's 9-2 favourite, may sign off in the Champion after missing the Arc owing to a pulled muscle. Marcus Tregoning will assess the Derby winner's prospects after Sir Percy has worked this weekend. Strike Up The Band, trained by Dandy Nicholls and ridden by his son, Adrian, made all to win the 5f Prix de Bonneval at Chantilly yesterday by two lengths from Michael Jarvis's One Putra. Borderlescott, the most fancied of the British trio, could only finish sixth but should have been much closer, having led on the far side of the track, wide of the main group. Royston Ffrench, his jockey, said: \"It was the wrong plan but to be honest I was carried over and couldn't do anything about it.\" Ron Cox's tip of the day Ceremonial Jade 4.45 Lingfield Apart from Sesmen, no horse has done more to advertise rookie trainer Marco Botti's skills than Ceremonial Jade. Best excused his one below-par run on soft ground, the three-year-old bounced back with an impressive win on Kempton's Polytrack surface. Ceremonial Jade has gone up 9lb for that, but the style in which he shot clear of some in-form rivals suggests he is ahead of the handicapper.
