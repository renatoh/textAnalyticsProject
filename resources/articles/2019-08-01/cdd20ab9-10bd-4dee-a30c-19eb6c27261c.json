The 33-year-old still has more than two seasons left on his DC United contract but Derby\u2019s owner, Mel Morris, believes Rooney could inspire a squad which went so close to promotion under Frank Lampard last season. Derby appointed the former Barcelona midfielder Phillip Cocu as manager last month on a four-year contract following Lampard\u2019s move to Chelsea. Initial talks between Derby and Rooney\u2019s agent, Paul Stretford, have taken place and Morris is expecting more discussions in the near future. The former Everton and Manchester United striker, who is England\u2019s all-time record scorer with 53 goals in 120 appearances for his country, has made little secret of his desire to move into management and would be keen on a return to England. \u201cI\u2019m taking the steps to get my badges completed and when I finish playing I\u2019ll see what opportunities come up,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cThere\u2019s already offers which have been made, but at the minute I\u2019m still a player and I want to enjoy playing, and then I\u2019ll see which offers are right when I do finish.\u201d Asked if he had been contacted by clubs from England or the United States, he added: \u201cYeah, both. There\u2019s an opportunity for me to go into management straight away and when I do hang my boots up, that decision will be made on what the ambition of the club is first of all, and what my ambitions are and what\u2019s right for both myself and that particular team.\u201d Derby won 2-1 at Huddersfield in their opening Championship fixture on Monday evening. Two first-half goals from Tom Lawrence ultimately proved enough despite a Karlan Grant penalty for the hosts. The result meant that for the first time, all three sides that were relegated from the Premier League the previous season lost their opening Championship games. Lawrence\u2019s first came after an unfortunate defensive error from home debutant Tommy Elphick, but he deserved full credit for his second \u2013 a well-taken effort from the edge of the box. Kieran Dowell\u2019s clumsy challenge on Juninho Bacuna in the penalty area opened the door for Grant \u2013 the Terriers\u2019 top scorer last season with only four goals \u2013 to reduce Derby\u2019s lead from the spot. Cocu, speaking after the Huddersfield win, said of Rooney: \u201cAt the moment I can\u2019t say anything. We\u2019re working on completing the team and I cannot say anything about names before things are done. \u201cWe have a lot of players who could be an asset for the team. You always try to get the best you can with the resources available at the club. \u201cA few more days and hopefully I can tell you something more.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
