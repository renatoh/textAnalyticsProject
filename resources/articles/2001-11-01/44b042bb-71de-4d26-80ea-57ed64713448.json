Last night Gordon Brown used a speech to the Institute of Directors in London to set out the main contents of the package, set to be billed by the Treasury as a boost to stop industry falling into recession. \"I understand people's worries about the effects on their jobs and livelihoods of a global slowdown, which will inevitably impact on Britain's economic growth,\" Mr Brown said. \"And in the pre-Budget report we will do more to recognise the vital contribution of modern manufacturing to exports, innovation and our great regions.\" Responding this morning, the shadow chancellor, Michael Howard, threw doubt on Mr Brown's claims to have brought economic success. He said if Mr Brown cut taxes in coming months, as he signalled he would last night, it would have to be set against the burdens he had imposed on business. \"Over the last four years they add up to an extra \u00a310bn a year, roughly \u00a35bn in extra taxes and \u00a35bn a year in red tape and regulation,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"It is hardly surprising in these circumstances that we have fallen from ninth to 19th in the world competitiveness league and British firms are now less able to win orders and create jobs. \"Taxes in the UK are already low by comparison to other competitors, while our public services are poor,\" added the Liberal Democrat shadow chancellor Matthew Taylor. \"Labour was elected to give priority to health, education and pensions, not to tax cuts that overwhelmingly favour the richest members of society.\" Last night the chancellor said that his report, to be delivered to the Commons on November 27, would have a central theme of \"our support for enterprise, for building a stronger, more dynamic, enterprise economy\". He confirmed the government was considering further cuts in small company tax and had plans to reduce further capital gains tax, in moves widely trailed yesterday in advance of his speech. \"Our aim for this decade should be to achieve the fastest rise in productivity of competitor countries,\" he said. \"Indeed, in a period where the world is slowing down it is the high productivity performers that will gain the most.\" The chancellor said his budget decisions next April would reflect the goals of ensuring a competitive environment throughout the economy and maximising education, employment and economic opportunities \"so people can make the most of their talents, ideas and initiatives\". He went on: \"Having already cut corporation tax for companies from 33 to 30 pence - the lowest rate in the history of British corporation tax - and having also cut small business tax from 23 to 20 pence and introduced a new starting rate of tax for small companies of 10 pence in the pound we are considering further measures to extend the cuts in small company tax.\" Mr Brown confirmed that the long-term rate of capital gains tax for business assets would be cut from 40% to 20% for investments held for one year and to 10% for investments held for two years. The chancellor also heralded a change in competition policy saying he was \"sending an important message that the days of picking winners and uneconomic state subsidies and corporate fixes are over and cannot return - and wherever there are barriers to competition we will tackle them\". Mr Brown also said the government was considering \"a further tax cut for innovation and research and development that will give Britain one of the best incentives for innovation anywhere in the industrialised world\". He added: \"All our reforms are designed to create a more adaptable workforce for the modern dynamic labour market where people change jobs more often and skills are at a premium.\" After reports that he and the prime minister were at odds on whether Britain should join the euro sooner rather than later, Mr Brown did not mention the euro by name. He said simply: \"And we will not change our European policy either: in principle our support for the single currency, in practice the five economic tests that have to be met.\" Mr Brown also confirmed that after September 11 Britain had offered to \"co-ordinate a central register for technical assistance to countries implementing anti-terrorist measures\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
