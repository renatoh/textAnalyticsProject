St Paul was due to go out on BBC1 from 7pm on Sunday May 11 but has been replaced in the channel's schedule by a repeat of Harrison Ford movie Raiders of the Lost Ark. A BBC spokeswoman said that St Paul had been rescheduled for Sunday June 29, which coincides with the feast of St Peter and St Paul. However, speculation was rife that the BBC is being particularly cautious because of Mr Edwards' new role at Ofcom, where he has been appointed as one of the watchdogs who will adjudicate over any viewer complaints. Ofcom is due to be up and running by the end of the year, taking over the responsibilities of five existing regulatory bodies. These will include the roles of the independent television commission and broadcasting standards commission in handling viewer complaints. As the member of the Ofcom content board for England, Mr Edwards will be involved in ruling on complaints about programming on issues including fairness and taste and decency. His appointment last month to the watchdog's content board met with complaints from some quarters, with critics claiming his strong religious beliefs could mean the new regulator will be more likely to take a censorious view of controversial shows. The Secular Society said of Edwards' appointment: \"We fear Mary Whitehouse may be being reincarnated - but this time with real power to impose censorship rather than to just demand it.\" ITV insiders believe the religious documentary has been withdrawn because BBC bosses are worried about the poor ratings performance of the BBC1 Sunday night schedule in recent weeks. St Paul would have gone in the same 7pm-8pm slot where Leonardo, the arts documentary fronted by BBC director of drama, entertainment and children's Alan Yentob, is currently attracting low ratings against Coronation Street. Leonardo launched with just 3.5 million viewers the weekend before last and was watched by 4 million last Sunday. BBC1's ever popular Antiques Roadshow can attract audiences of up to 9 million viewers at the same time on Sunday evenings. But St Paul would be likely to be watched by an audience similar in size to Leonardo. And the small BBC1 audience between 7pm and 8pm is having a knock-on effect in terms of the audience inheritance being handed on to the drama Born and Bred. The first series of Born and Bred last spring attracted audiences of more than 7 million viewers. But on Sunday night, with an inheritance of just 4 million viewers from Leonardo, the BBC1 drama could muster only 5.7 million against ITV1's Heartbeat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
