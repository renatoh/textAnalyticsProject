That is intended as a compliment. I sat through this recording of Poul Ruders's adaptation of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale in something like shock, a screw turning in the pit of my stomach. That alone is testament to the work's terrorising impact. It's also, I think, what we are meant to feel when we hear the opera, or read the book. The inevitable question is why? What is it about The Handmaid's Tale that makes it such a uniquely distressing experience? Atwood's 1985 novel is a grimly dystopian prophecy that envisions a totalitarian society based on fundamentalist religious principals. Christian revolutionaries have taken over the US, renaming it the Republic of Gilead, overriding its democracy and enforcing codified biblical laws on sexual conduct. All fertile women who have expressed what is perceived as trangressive desire are brainwashed into becoming Handmaids - surrogate mothers to elite childless couples, their babies conceived during ritual Ceremonies in which husbands (called Commanders) have sex with the Handmaids in the presence of their wives. What pushes the book into territory way beyond polemic and really hits raw nerves, however, is Atwood's emphasis on the collusion of some women in the oppression of others, and on the dire similarities between the languages of right-wing reaction and radical sexual politics. During the Ceremony, the Handmaid is held down by the wife. So-called Aunts emotionally batter women into submission and preside over the communal execution of offenders. The Handmaids are \"only containers, walking wombs\", who may not arouse desire. \"To be seen is to be penetrated,\" shrieks the fanatical Aunt Lydia, steering perilously close to the radical feminist perspective that equates male desire with rape. The novel charts the thoughts of one Handmaid, Offred (named after the Commander whose property she is), as she begins both to find her voice and identity in opposition to the regime, and gradually to recall the murder of her husband and her separation from her daughter during the revolution. Atwood's cliff-hanging finale offers little way out of the nightmare beyond the eventual collapse of Gilead over time, and it's not surprising that when Hollywood filmed the novel in 1989, a redemptive ending was tacked on. Ruders and his librettist, Paul Bentley, offer us no such hope. The opera's genius lies in Ruders's ability to find a sound world that mirrors the novel's oppressive tone. The strictures of tonality and minimalism are broadly equated with totalitiarian suppression, while atonality is aligned with individuality - but emotional dissonance is rarely absent for long, and the cumulative impression is of an impending eruption that never happens. The effects are crushing, forcing us to share Offred's experience. Pulverising percussion pins the listener down. Obsessively repeated phrases sting like the cattle prods the Aunts use to persecute their victims. Amazing Grace threads its way through the score like some wonky Bach chorale, combining with ejaculatory glockenspiel trickles to form an obscene accompaniment to the Ceremonies. The whole is relentless. Only once, at the work's climax, does Ruders let the pace slacken. He uses not one, but two singers for the principal character, representing Offred the Handmaid and the woman she was in \"the Time Before\". As memories obliterate the Aunts' conditioning, the two women join in a duet of Monteverdian simplicity as they mourn the loss of Offred's child. Horror suddenly finds release in grief, and the effect is devastating. The casting of both roles is telling. Marianne Rorholm, very much a singing actress, is the Handmaid, her voice clotting throughout with exhaustion and anguish. Hanne Fischer, voluptuous in tone, is the sensual, emotionally fulfilled woman she once was. Her lovers are two contrasting tenors. Poul Elming, virile and athletic, is the husband who exists in her memory, while Gert Henning-Jensen, elegant and lyrical, plays Nick, the Guard she comes to desire in the present. The late, much-missed Aage Haugland is a slimy, hypocritical Commander, with Susanne Resmark as his possessive, Gospel-singing wife. Anne Margarethe Dahl voices Aunt Lydia's stratospheric vituperation with sickening vividness. In the pit Michael Schonwandt astounds, as always. The recording was made during the premiere run in Ruders's native Denmark last March, and there is a considerable amount of stage clatter, though you can live with it. Curiously, however, a bit of the piece is missing. Taking his cue from Atwood, Bentley frames the opera with a narration, delivered after the fall of Gilead by a lecturer presenting the tapes on which the Handmaid tells her tale. The spoken sections have been cut, which is a pity, since the sound of a woman's voice stuttering into song after male speech must have been overwhelming in the theatre. You need to hear this, if you think your nerves can take it - but you must prepare to be disturbed and very, very afraid if you do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
