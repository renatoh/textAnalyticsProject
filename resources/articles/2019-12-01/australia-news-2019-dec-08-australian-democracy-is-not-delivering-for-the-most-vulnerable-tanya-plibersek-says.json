Labor\u2019s former deputy leader will tell a conference that Australian voters are disillusioned because too many of them are worse off financially, even as the nation as a whole becomes wealthier. \u201cWe sometimes ask people to accept enormous social and economic change, without sharing the economic benefits of that change,\u201d Plibersek will say. \u201cThis feels a lot like a broken contract. \u201cThose struggling hardest, people on Newstart and sole parents, know this truth intimately \u2013 and express disaffection most strongly. Indeed, the group with the lowest trust in democracy \u2013 low-income women \u2013 are the people for whom national economic growth has delivered least. \u201cAustralians can see the immense changes moving through their lives and their communities \u2013 but cannot see their government responding in an equally serious way. There are no obvious plans for meeting the biggest problems facing this country. Most of these are stubborn and intergenerational.\u201d Plibersek will argue people lose trust in politics when they sense a distance between their lived experienced and the priorities and behaviour of those who govern, and the only way to turn the trust deficit around is to \u201cshow the genuine benefit of our system, in clear and material ways\u201d. \u201cThat means being prepared to tackle the hard issues without resorting to insulting simplicity: the ongoing problem of stagnant wages and an insecure labour market; climate change and energy policy; the persistence of inequality and its disproportionate impact on young people.\u201d She says Labor needs to be better than their political opponents, referencing the donations scandal in the New South Wales party. \u201cAs a party, we need to beat the standards we set for our opponents \u2013 to call out corruption and bad behaviour wherever we see it, including on our own side of politics, even when it feels uncomfortable. Especially when it feels uncomfortable.\u201d Plibersek will urge fellow progressives to not just participate, but think about how they contribute to the national conversation. She says it is important to show up \u201cwith generosity, sincerity, kindness, determination and thoughtfulness \u2013 matched by hard, methodical, practical work\u201d. She will say progressive people have a responsibility to work cooperatively for the greater good, to seek the middle ground and find common cause. Plibersek will endorse Barack Obama\u2019s recent criticism of woke \u201ccall out\u201d culture as a substitute for the real hard work of political, social and economic change. \u201cAs citizens, we need to teach ourselves again how to talk, listen and argue courteously,\u201d Plibersek will say. \u201cWe need to take our democratic responsibilities seriously. And if you really believe no one represents you, you should consider joining a party or standing for office.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
