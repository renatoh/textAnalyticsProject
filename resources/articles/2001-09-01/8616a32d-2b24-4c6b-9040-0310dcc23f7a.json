Whether the orchestra will ultimately come to be regarded as a major interpreter of French music remains to be seen, for this was an evening of peaks and troughs. The best of it, however, was remarkable indeed. The centrepiece, if not quite the high point, was Henri Dutilleux's Baudelaire-inspired cello concerto Tout un Monde Lointain, performed in honour of the composer's 85th birthday. It's a work imbued with erotic yearning, an evocation of the palpable mystery and beauty of sex. The cello's vibrating monody, dreamily played by Steven Isserlis, is enfolded in orchestral textures of quivering, almost tactile sensuousness. There are brief, rearing, phallic outbursts from the brass and slippery percussion caresses. It sends shivers down your spine - though the real thrill came later, with a performance of the second suite from the ballet Bacchus et Ariane by Albert Roussel. Roussel, who died in 1937, is one of the shamefully neglected geniuses of 20th-century music and Bacchus et Ariane, written for the choreographer Serge Lifar in 1931, is one of his masterpieces. Again, the subject - the abandoned Ariadne's sexual and emotional awakening at the hands of the god Bacchus - is erotic. The score combines orgiastic, rhythmic frenzy with orchestral glamour. Gorgeously played, with virtuoso work in brass and woodwind, it brought the house down. Elsewhere, however, things were less assured. The rest of the programme consisted of Faur\u00e9's Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande and Debussy's La Mer, works that straddle the turn of the 20th century. Ashkenazy pulls both of them towards post-Romantic grandeur with questionable results. He makes Faur\u00e9 sound Austro-German, with Wagnerian allusions played up and the famous Sicilienne mutating into a Viennese waltz. La Mer, done big and too slowly, slides away from impressionism almost towards Mahlerian introspection. A wildly variable evening, in short - though I doubt whether anyone who heard that performance of Bacchus et Ariane will forget it in a hurry.
