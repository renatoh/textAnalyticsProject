The former Labour cabinet minister demanded new models of global governance to take account of the redistribution of economic power in the world, appearing to back European calls for reforms of institutions such as the IMF, set up in 1944 at Bretton Woods. His comments, at a World Economic Forum conference on \"new champions\", found an echo among Chinese political leaders, bankers and regulators, who all demanded stricter international rules on regulation of financial institutions. Mandelson urged \"an international system in which not just the G7 or G8 and OECD will be reaching out and inviting so-called emerging economies in for a cup of tea every now and again or a coffee to hear their views and then politely ask them to leave as we take the decisions\". Insisting that the global capital market system is not \"fundamentally flawed\", he said: \"We are now looking to the larger, faster-growing economies to take up the slack. We need them to be the source of liquidity, of demand, of investment, of confidence in the global economy.\" Liu Mingkang, chairman of China's banking regulatory commission, demanded agreement on greater international supervision. \"The degree of leverage now is dangerous and indefensible. Worse, it is not regulated by prudential supervision,\" he said, calling US levels of pre-crisis lending \"ridiculous\". As senior US bankers admitted the crisis was the most acute since the Great Depression of the 1930s, China's premier Wen Jiabao promised that his country would contribute growth of about 10% a year and financial market reforms to help a global recovery. Chinese growth, which came close to 12% last year, has \"slowed\" to about 10% so far this year and Jiang Jianqing, chairman of ICBC, the world's biggest bank, said it could be maintained at this level. Inflation, which peaked at 8.7% this year, was down to 4.9% thanks to intervention by the monetary authorities. Wen said: \"We have full confidence and the ability to overcome all sorts of difficulties in order to keep our economy growing in a sound and fast manner for a longer time to come. \"What we can do now is to maintain China's strong, stable and relatively fast growth and avoid big fluctuations. That is the biggest contribution we can make to the world economy under the current circumstances.\" Stephen Roach, Asia chairman of US investment bank Morgan Stanley, said a 14-year US consumer \"binge\" had come to an end and spending growth would slow to about half of recent levels, producing a US version of Japan's \"lost decade\" of deflation. He added: \"The American consumer is toast, done, finished.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
