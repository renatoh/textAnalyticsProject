That, at least, seems to be the manager's main concern about this afternoon's game at Old Trafford. The visitors do not act with the meekness of men resigned to their fate. That is to their credit but the hostility can be taken to extremes. Today, for instance, their side will be without Ildefonso Lima, a centre-half at the Italian Serie B club Triestina who is serving a six-match ban for spitting at an Armenian player last year. Andorra can bring out the worst in the opposition as well. In the course of an otherwise gentle 4-0 home win for Holland over Andorra in the World Cup qualifiers, the PSV Eindhoven midfielder Phillip Cocu was dismissed for violent conduct. So McClaren emphasised the importance of restraint and used his press conference to alert the Austrian referee for today's match, Bernhard Brugger. \"What I am going to stress to the players,\" said the manager, \"is that we keep ourselves under control and do not get antagonised. In all the tapes I've watched they've not been afraid to upset opponents and to get involved. \"In the Holland game Cocu got sent off. in the Romania [World Cup qualifier] there were quite a few incidents where players came together, and what I am looking for is a strong referee. We talk about treating Andorra with respect, like playing Brazil, and I think refs have to do that [as well] at international level. They are refereeing a match between a smaller team and a bigger team and they have to treat it the same. \"They are very aggressive in their tackling. They put themselves about. They are not easily beaten. They give free-kicks away and we just need to be calm and finish the game with 11 players on the park.\" The personnel asked to do so have been changed since last month's friendly with Greece only because of injury. Phil Neville replaces his absent brother Gary at right-back and Wes Brown deputises for his Manchester United team-mate Rio Ferdinand, whose bruised toe may heal in time for him to face Macedonia in Skopje on Wednesday. The proliferation of excellent English centre-halves has meant that little attention was paid to Brown's plight. He made his England debut seven years ago but today will bring merely his 10th cap. The previous one came on the summer tour to the United States in 2005. He has been hindered, in particular, by ankle problems, yet his worth has stayed clear in the mind of McClaren, who witnessed his promise as assistant manager at Old Trafford. \"I worked with Wes when he was a young lad coming through at United - great potential,\" McClaren said. \"He had everything: great pace, read the game well, good in the air and aggressive. At the end of last season his performances were excellent. He has started this season very well and I had no hesitation including him. He has the right character, the right temperament for international football.\" The back four should not have many opportunities to show their worth against Andorra, but McClaren is pleased by the prospect of a future benefit to the defence as Ashley Cole, in the wake of the move to Chelsea, spends his club career with John Terry to his right and Joe Cole directly in front of him. The understanding that fosters must benefit England. McClaren saw the \"relief on his face\" when the left-back's transfer from Ashburton Grove to Stamford Bridge started to take shape on Thursday. He assumes that Cole's form will be bolstered by that gladness and that he will be influential in stretching Andorra. Neville has the same duties on the other flank. The manager, recalling how frustrated England were before Peter Crouch broke the deadlock late in the World Cup match with Trinidad &amp; Tobago, counsels patience. \"It is not about the amount of goals,\" he said. \"It is about the performance, playing good football and winning the game. It is about passing the ball well, good movement, crosses into the box and shots raining in on goal.\" Humility ought to come naturally to England. As McClaren agrees, the constant emphasis on morale and team-building since he was appointed is a reaction to a miserable experience. He admits the \"low spirit in the camp\" after the side was knocked out of the World Cup. \"Everyone felt we came back too early,\" he said. \"The one thing that has helped is the Greece performance and getting that first game out of the way. Everyone has moved on from the World Cup and said, 'OK, what's the future going to be like?'\" McClaren knows that England have far to go before anyone will again be persuaded to rank them as a major force. \"Beating Andorra,\" he said, \"will not prove anything.\" Controlling the game and winning comfortably, however, would see England open Group E in a satisfactorily professional manner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
