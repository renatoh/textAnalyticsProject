The wing's 20th try of the season secured victory in a tense, fractious encounter in keeping with recent games between these sides. Saracens were unable to give a happy send-off to Kyran Bracken, who led the side out and was given a standing ovation when he left the field a quarter of an hour after half-time. In the end the game was decided by the boot of Andy Goode, who left Saracens under a cloud in 2003 after a short spell at the club. With both sides having won four successive victories, Heineken Cup places were at stake and Leicester knew that a fifth win would secure a place in the Premiership semi-final play-offs. Leicester made costly early mistakes, however, Goode missing the kind of penalty opportunity he would normally convert in his sleep and Alesana Tuilagi knocking the ball on with a try begging. With Glen Jackson landing three penalties for Saracens, the Tigers looked ruffled. Leicester's bad luck continued when Lewis Moody's try was ruled null and void by the video referee, the flanker judged not to have released the ball when held up on the line by Jackson and Tevita Vaikona. Varndell soon made amends when he scored the only try of the game after a perfectly judged cross-kick by Goode, who landed the conversion from the touchline. And Jackson's boot again proved too accurate when he connected with Harry Ellis's head in the process of clearing the ball. Ellis, cut over the right eye, was temporarily replaced by Austin Healey soon after the interval. Healey made an immediate impression, though not in a way Leicester would have hoped, conceding a penalty when he playfully tapped Bracken on the back of the head and received a mouthful from his fellow No9. Jackson landed the penalty, a kick soon cancelled out by Goode, and a patched-up Ellis returned to the fray. Goode then kicked his second penalty to put Leicester ahead for the first time.
