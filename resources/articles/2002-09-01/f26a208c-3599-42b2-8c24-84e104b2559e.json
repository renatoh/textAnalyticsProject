Auctioneers tend to deal in property that is being sold off by housing associations, councils and banks, usually in a state of disrepair, or homes that have been repossessed. This means that the property will often require considerable structural work. Your task is made more difficult by the fact that, typically, you have three weeks from the issue of the sale catalogue to the auction. In this time you must have had a survey done and have sorted out your mortgage, which would require a Herculean effort. If you do decide to go ahead, visit some property auctions (find them in the Yellow Pages, or at Yell.com) in advance to see how it's done. You will soon notice that most properties go for about 5% to 10% above the guide price. It is therefore important to set your budget and stick to it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
