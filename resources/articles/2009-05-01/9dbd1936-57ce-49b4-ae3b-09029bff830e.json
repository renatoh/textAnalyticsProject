Easy, and frankly irresistible. Workstreams to drill down into a vision of the future? More Ben than Brian? Leveraging external assets? It sounds like English, but not as we know it. Somewhere deep within the babble, though, some interesting points were being made. Harrison Fraser had spent several months conducting 75 interviews with people both inside and outside the sport about what it gets right and wrong, which is a reasonable place to start, and the good news seems to be that the basic racing product is a strong one. What's more, when people get passionate about it, they tend to stay that way. The problem, of course, is that the passion needs to be kindled in several thousand new punters and racegoers every year to replace the ones that die, and that is just to stand still. That is not easy, particularly when full engagement with the sport via betting is illegal until after the age of 18. A personal view is that for all the talk about the 18-30 age group, it is the 18-20 cohort that needs attention as this is when many habits are set for life. A chunky free bet on racing for any 18-year-old who registers via the British Horseracing Authority website is one possibility, and extending free entry to racecourses to anyone under 20 is another. Anyone who turns, say, a free \u00a320 bet into \u00a3100 is unlikely to keep the fact from their friends. It was certainly an encouraging part of yesterday's briefing that the crucial importance of betting on racing was not ignored. Indeed, it was acknowledged that if, in five years' time, a miraculous marketing effort has turned Ryan Moore into a household name, it will still be seen as a failure if that fame is not translated into bets. It is now down to the various sub-committees charged with getting Harrison Fraser's vision to work to come up with as many good ideas as possible. Even then, though, the concern has to be that they will never get any further than that, given racing's history of factionalism and jealously guarded self-interest. There was much talk yesterday of consultation, persuasion and everyone pulling together for the common good. If people can't agree, though, there is no way for anyone to force them. Nic Coward, the British Horseracing Authority's chief executive, may believe with every fibre of his being that a particular course of action is the way forward, but if, say, the racecourses disagree, there's precious little he can do about it. Consensus should be a better way forward than edicts, but it may be no coincidence that the great reformers of racing history \u2013 Bunbury, Bentinck and Rous \u2013 were known even in their own time as the \"Dictators of the Turf\". Without a leader with the real power to force through change, the latest attempt to rebrand the sport may, like so many others, prove to be all talk and no action."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
