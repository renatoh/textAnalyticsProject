It\u2019s all there, densely packed into an hour of theatre, hip-hop and spoken word. There\u2019s Musa\u2019s own story of how his life fell apart after the death of his hero, Muhammad Ali. There\u2019s his best mate, out of Goulburn jail and riding a self-destructive streak. There\u2019s the woman he fell in love with \u2013 inscrutable, captivating him as she halves MDMA caps, and breaking his heart when she starts calling him \u201cchamp\u201d. But there\u2019s also the other stuff. The Australia stuff. It\u2019s being told at school that your skin is the colour of shit. It\u2019s being singled out by Mark Latham on Twitter. It\u2019s shock jocks and far-right rallies and riots declaring war on the religion you were raised with. It\u2019s race-baiting by politicians to win elections. It\u2019s learning, Musa says, \u201cwhat it means to be a young brown boy on black land run by white people\u201d. Born and raised in Queanbeyan, the son of Australian arts journalist Helen Musa and Malaysian poet and actor Musa bin Masran, Musa is a confident performer who can hold the stage on his own with little more than a sonorous voice and evocative writing (the river is a recurring motif that he invokes memorably with just a few lines of poetry, and a flowing movement of his hands). But sitting in the gloom of the empty theatre before the second night of his show, he admits to feeling conflicted about the work. \u201cSince Ali Died is based on autobiography but still it\u2019s fictive, conflating several people into one character. What I like to do with a lot of my work is take autobiographical elements and heighten them to the level of some type of myth \u2013 sometimes almost like a fairytale. \u201cOf course it\u2019s fucking scary because, having said all of that, you are still putting your life out on show, your pain and grief \u2013 and the dark side of yourself. It\u2019s a very vulnerable, dangerous spot and I\u2019m still not sure how it makes me feel.\u201d The work was first performed last year, to rapturous public response. Doesn\u2019t that somewhat ease the vulnerability? \u201cI\u2019d venture to say it makes me feel uneasy rather than overjoyed,\u201d he answers. \u201cYou are risking your sanity, you are risking your life every time you get on stage. I see art and writing as dangerous. I have made the mistake of thinking art is the best type of therapy. I can only present my words in a confident way because I have gone through a fire to make the work \u2013 but it\u2019s all on unsteady foundations.\u201d Omar has been writing and performing for more than a decade; he has recorded albums, written a novel \u2013 Here Come The Dogs \u2013 and books of poetry, and performs as a slam poet. The play, his first, is directed by Anthea Williams, who Omar says \u201cwas able to identify some of the chaotic threads in my work\u201d, and found a way to bring them together in one story. The pair spent ten intensive days nutting out a structure that combines rap performance with prose, and poetry with theatre. But for all the praise and his increasing reach, Musa says he has grown ambivalent about writing and performing. \u201cI don\u2019t think this play will live much longer than this year,\u201d Musa says. \u201cIt\u2019s painful, it\u2019s difficult to dredge all that personal stuff up again night after night, when you are trying to write a new chapter in your life and put some of this stuff behind you. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just not professional enough to be more detached from it but I feel so depleted. Art destroys you as much as it fulfils you \u2013 even more \u2013 which is why I\u2019m getting to a point where I might even give it up.\u201d He hesitates before qualifying this: \u201cI would never be able to fully give it up \u2013 it\u2019s within me. I want to do another novel. But making my passion into my profession, I sometimes wonder if that\u2019s a big misstep. It feels like the audience is getting more out of it than I am and, as the audience is getting bigger and bigger, I\u2019m getting smaller and smaller \u2013 and one day, am I just going to vanish into thin air? And what was it worth? Do I have to sacrifice my mind and life and my liver and my everything to make art? Maybe it\u2019s better if I just go and tend to a garden in Borneo \u2013 grow eggplants and chillies.\u201d In fact, Musa is seriously considering spending more time in the archipelago, \u201ctowards Malaysia, towards Borneo, towards Indonesia\u201d, he says. He recently stayed with his father in Sabah, Borneo. Each day \u201cyou just trundle down to the local restaurants, grab a plate of kway teow, squeeze a calamansi lime over it, have an iced lime tea, sip on that \u2013 get a nice mangostein, the princess of the fruits, or the king of the fruits: a durian.\u201d Writing comes easy there, he says. \u201cThe humidity ignites my creative mind.\u201d But one also gets the sense that, at 35, Musa has not only grown weary of Australia\u2019s rolling culture wars, but of being betwixt and between. \u201cI\u2019m Australian-Malaysian \u2013 I am in between. I will be forever stuck on the hyphen. You have access to different identities and different eyes, but it can also be very dislocating. You can feel lost a lot of the time, as much as you try to let these dual identities enrich you. But they sometimes can leave you feeling completely lost.\u201d Right now, his imagination is fired up by the stories and myths of Borneo. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have a change every few years and shake things up. Yes, Australia does get me down a lot, but I\u2019m choosing Malaysia because it interests me and I have a lot to learn, not because of an outright rejection of Australia.\u201d So what does he love about Australia? He thinks about his answer carefully. \u201cI love the landscape. I love the river in my hometown. I love the smell of Australia \u2013 fire and smoke and earth and salt, the height of summer \u2013 there\u2019s nothing else like that smell. You\u2019re on the edge of an adventure. But also its dangerous \u2013 it feels like things could blow up or combust. \u201cI also love the sort of interconnected ethnic groups that would happen nowhere else in the world \u2013 Aboriginal kids friends with Macedonian kids friends with the Malaysian kid. Where else would you have that kind of mix? He continues: \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of possibility \u2013 but that\u2019s also what disillusions me. It could be a really great place if we managed to grapple with our past. There\u2019s still a small enough population on this big island that we could sort of negotiate an outcome that\u2019s as fair and as even minded as [Australia] pretends to be \u2013 whereas you look at America, and it\u2019s inexorably fucked. The wealth disparity, the population, the guns; you think, \u2018What could anyone ever do with that mess?\u2019 That\u2019s what kills me. Australia could be so much better \u2013 but instead we indulge our worst instincts and we\u2019re small-minded and we\u2019re petty, we lack empathy and it\u2019s like, \u2018Why?\u2019\u201d Maybe Musa will spend his early middle period tending to a garden in Borneo and writing \u201conly for lovers or friends\u201d but his is a restless, hungry mind. Even through the burnout, there\u2019s a sense that he\u2019s not done yet. \u2022 Since Ali Died runs at SBW Stables theatre, Darlinghurst, until 19 January, and at Riverside theatres, Parramatta, 22-25 January"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
