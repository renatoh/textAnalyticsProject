In staging a protest against \"elitism\" in British life, he raised questions that are worth consideration at any time, and particularly at a moment in the country's history when the rich and the poor are growing further apart. For his act of disruption, he identified a target that symbolises to some people, even in better times than these, the class divide. To others, the annual race between Oxford and Cambridge represents Britain at its most harmless and playful: a good day out, with a long tradition, and sometimes even producing a wonderfully dramatic contest, as it was threatening to do when Oldfield's head bobbed above the water on Saturday. In that moment, a lot of people's fun was spoilt. The competitors \u2013 or half of them, at least \u2013 will feel they were unfairly deprived of an important moment in their young lives, particularly Oxford's cox, poor Zoe de Toledo, who steered her crew to disaster after guiding them into what had looked like a very promising position before the race was halted. Even Cambridge may feel their victory somewhat less than fully satisfying. But of course this particular university challenge asks its own questions about privilege and elitism. Of Saturday's crews, Oxford fielded four British oarsmen \u2013 an unusually high proportion nowadays \u2013 and Cambridge only one. The remainder were the now familiar mixture of giant postgraduates from the US, Germany, Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, aged between 22 and 29, each paying fees of around \u00a320,000 a year for a post-graduate course which includes a chance to take part in an historic contest. This upsets traditionalists. But without those fees, Britain's two top universities would find it hard to maintain their status among the world's elite educational institutes. So was it fair for Oldfield to intervene in the lives of these young men and that young woman, wantonly shattering their dreams in the process? No one now disputes the effectiveness of Emily Davison's self-sacrifice in the suffragettes' cause at the 1913 Derby, while Oldfield-style \"guerrilla tactics\" were deployed in the 1970s to blow the first holes in the armour of the apologists for apartheid South Africa, who included the international rugby authorities. At the other end of the scale of acceptability lies the massacre of Israeli athletes during the 1972 Olympics. Next week the 12 teams of the Formula One circus are due to race in Bahrain, where bloody civil unrest \u2013 including allegations of torture \u2013 caused the cancellation of last year's grand prix. This year the ruling Khalifa family are keen to run the race, both as a visible sign of a return to political normality and for its value \u2013 said to be around \u00a3300m \u2013 to the local economy. The Khalifas are petrolheads. They built a new track at enormous expense, they own 40% of the McLaren team, and they cosy up to Bernie Ecclestone, to whom they pay a \u00a340m annual licence fee. They are also accused of sanctioning various forms of repression, including torture. The teams are divided. Some \u2013 including McLaren, obviously \u2013 are keen to advertise their desire to go ahead, despite the continuing stories of human rights abuses. Others, more worried about their personal safety than about the alleged jailing of medical personnel who treated demonstrators, are less sure. Meanwhile Damon Hill, the 1996 world champion and a member of Sky Sports's new F1 commentary team, has bravely come out and said that he thinks it would be a mistake, given the \"pain, anger and tension\" in Bahrain, for the race to go ahead. Hill visited the country last year and made positive noises on his return. Now he has seen enough fresh evidence to change his view, and to challenge a PR campaign that seeks to minimise the demonstrations as the work of a bunch of yobs throwing Molotov cocktails. His words will not win him widespread popularity in the paddock, but they should be taken seriously as Formula One prepares itself for a last-minute decision. If they do not go, no one will suffer as William Zeng, the No2 man in the Oxford boat, did on Saturday. A 22-year-old from Great Falls, Virginia, studying for a doctorate in computer science on a Rhodes scholarship, he tweeted at length about his anger. Reading his tribute to the crews' wasted dedication and courage, and his charge that what Oldfield had in fact been protesting against was \"their right to devote years of their lives, their friendships and their souls to the fair pursuit of the joys and hardships of sport\", I concluded that on this occasion the wrong target \u2013 a bunch of innocent individuals \u2013 had been chosen. However that does not mean sport is always an inappropriate vehicle for the expression of legitimate protest. In a world where peaceful demonstrations, such as the march of a million in London against the invasion of Iraq in February 2003, appear to exert no influence at all, sometimes the dramatic gesture is the only one that works. richard.williams@ theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
