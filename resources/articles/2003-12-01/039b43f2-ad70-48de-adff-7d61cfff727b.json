Bratislava is not New York, of course - no Macy's, no Bloomingdale's, no Saks Fifth Avenue. But the Slovakian Tourist Board hymned \"the explosive development of the city and the opening of five major shopping centres within the past few years\": Polus City Centre, Shopping Park Bratislava, Shopping Park Soravia, the Aupark Shopping Mall and Avion Shopping Park, close to the airport. Breakfast at Shopping Park Bratislava ... the pulse was quickening. Two hours from Stansted; \u00a3150 with friendly Sky Europe; a plane full of Slovakian students on the way home rather than loud couples from Coventry maxing out on the credit card; and, if we could discover what the Slovakian currency was, almost certainly an excellent exchange rate. Who needs New York - thanks to the plummeting dollar currently crammed with British shopaholics, and hardly a plane ticket or hotel room to be had? \"The only thing I know about Slovakia is what I learned first-hand from your foreign minister, who came to Texas,\" George Bush told a proud Slovakian journalist - shortly after meeting the prime minister of Slovenia. Banana republic? Christmas shopping for me normally means 45 minutes in Marks &amp; Spencer on the Saturday before the Big Day. Vouchers for my parents; Belgian chocolates for my wife; a history-of-football video for my father-in-law; scarf, umbrella and handkerchiefs for my dad (all now banned under new parental regulations); Bing Crosby video, soaps and a cat calendar for my mother; a scale-model Mercedes for my son; an ornamental golf ball cleaner for my brother ... and home in time for the 1.40 at Ascot. Christmas over for another year. It's the thought that counts and each Christmas, as I rush round this shopping-made-simple corner of M&amp;S surrounded by other avatars of indolence, I can honestly say there hasn't been a moment of thought. But this year it's different - this year Bratislava, famed for its crystal and porcelain, its ultra-alcoholic drinks and its hand-made wooden toys, will make those presents worth opening. Surely a gift from the Baby Jesus Workshop in the Main Square of the Old Town will excite my two goddaughters more than their annual Smiths tokens. It's just a shame I missed the ox-roasting that marks the official start of the festive season. Now, it has to be said straight away that Bratislava's skyline - tower blocks and Lego houses marooned on the plain of the Danube - cannot compete with New York's. Bratislava has yet to find its Chrysler Building. Indeed, the deputy features editor's long-ago sighting of the city from the soulless ring road seems to have prompted his choice of Bratislava as my shopping Mecca. But that was then - eastern bloc drabness, Stalinist uniformity; now, Bratislava is as vibrant as the next town, though, admittedly, the next town is Nitra, where the Rough Guide highlights the Tesco hypermarket. New York is cold and has a foot of snow. Small dogs are buried up to their necks on the sidewalk. Bratislava is warm and sunny; the Danube looks a gorgeous shade of grey. We eventually work out that the currency is crowns, and get 40 to the euro at the airport's one foreign exchange desk. Slovakia is presumably applying to join Euroland, and it can't come soon enough: working in three currencies defeats me completely. There is none of New York's notorious bustle at Bratislava's small airport. In fact, there doesn't appear to be anyone here at all. We wait no more than half an hour for our luggage and spend another 20 minutes waiting for a taxi. For 472 crowns (or about \u20ac12, or some unknown amount in pounds), we are whisked into town, past a large Ikea - truly, Bratislava has joined the 21st century. \"We are here to shop,\" we tell the hotel receptionist, who hides his bemusement and suggests we try the Aupark Shopping Mall on the other side of the Danube - a short ride that costs us a surprising 282 crowns because the taxi gets stuck behind a stationary truck and an argument ensues. Aupark is delightfully Slovakian. A tape of White Christmas is playing at the glittering entrance - in Slovak - followed by a version of Mistletoe and Wine. I buy myself a Father Christmas hat with flashing red lights and blend into the festive scene. It's a medium-sized mall but pleasingly done, with a rickety translucent staircase and a water feature with no walls - ideal for accidentally tipping buggies into. There is a McDonald's, of course, a Benetton, a Lagerfeld shop in which, discouragingly, the goods are not priced, and a Gant store in which, discouragingly, they are - a woolly hat for \u00a325, a leather bag for \u00a3300. Or perhaps I'm miscalculating the rate. Anyway, the scale-model vintage Mercedes seem very cheap - so I buy two for my son. Despite the Slovakian covers of great Christmas hits, this could be Mallsville, Anywhere, so we head for the heart of the old town instead - along gleaming, litter-free streets filled with beautiful twentysomethings with impossibly high cheekbones. It's lunchtime in the main square, and young and old, shoppers and executives, are standing at high tables eating sausages and kebabs. I point at a cutlet and ask the vendor what it is. He doesn't speak English, but, from the clucking noises and flapping motions that follow, I assume it's chicken. It comes in a roll with a sickly, glutinous sauce - 65 crowns, though he tries to keep the 100 I give him. Time to do some serious shopping. There are dozens of stalls selling handicrafts, and I am drawn to one selling hand-carved figurines. These are priced at 1,300 crowns, and I assume I can haggle with the stallholder. But haggling with a man who is wearing a fox pelt and carrying an antique pistol is disconcerting, so I end up paying the full whack for a large, mournful-looking pilgrim. A lovely surprise for my father. I buy a pair of hand-made leather slippers for my wife for 780 crowns. I have lost track of the exchange rate, but reckon that, if a mournful-looking pilgrim is worth 1,300 crowns, a pair of leather slippers for 780 is a snip. The man on the stall spends a long time showing me how the leather straps of the slippers must be tied up the leg. His instructions are wholly incomprehensible. At least it will give us something to do on Christmas day. I had intended to buy some of the famously strong spirits - the concierge recommended Slivovica, Demanovka and Vorovicka - but I can't find them, so make do with honey wine, in a fetching horse-shaped bottle. The stallholder lets me taste the sweet and bitter versions, which he has warming on pans. I opt for the sweet, and leave him chatting to two nuns who seem to be regular customers. Honey wine may be habit-forming. My father-in-law will love this, though I'm also hoping to buy him a history of Slovakian football. I buy a pot of local honey for my mother-in-law, snowman-shaped biscuits covered in icing and a wooden elephant, whose trunk immediately falls off, for my young nephew, delicate corn dollies for my two god-daughters, and an unpleasant-looking chocolate sausage for the deputy features editor. I can't find anything for my brother - don't they play golf in Bratislava? - so he may have to have a history of Slovakian football, too. My mother deserves something special, so I head for a shop specialising in glassware. There is a large display of crystal vases and bowls, each of which I pick up to appreciate the weight and exquisite workmanship, before realising from the agitated looks of the staff that the prominent sign on the display says: \"Do not touch.\" I settle on a bowl for 2,000 crowns (or one and a half pilgrims) and hope my fellow customers - all elderly women in fur coats - admire my good taste. I try not to calculate the likelihood of my getting the crystal bowl back to the UK in one piece. I would like to carry on buying - though the lack of decent-sized plastic bags is proving a problem, and the batteries in my hat are running low. But I have to settle down to write the first Bratislavan shopping review, a task which is complicated by the fact that my hotel room overlooks an open-air skating rink, which appears to think loud rap music is the perfect accompaniment to skating. At least they're not playing Mistletoe and Wine. As I survey the lovely objects on the table before me, and listen to the frenzied screams of children colliding in the darkness on the ice, one thing is clear: New York's days as the world's shopping capital are numbered and Bratislava is ready to take over. All it will take is a sharp fall in the value of the pilgrim."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
