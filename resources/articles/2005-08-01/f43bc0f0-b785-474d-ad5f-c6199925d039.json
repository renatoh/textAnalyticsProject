International Distillers and Vintners spent several years in the mid-Seventies trying to come up with a red-wine brand that was suited to British tastes. The results of the test markets were somewhat surprising. When IDV put a series of prototype blends in front of members of the public, the one that consistently came out top was a Liebfraumilch dyed red. Thirty years ago, we drank sweet and medium-sweet whites, which is why Germany did so well here. These days we are supposed to be a lot more sophisticated, turning our noses up at what my local off-licence manager still calls 'Liberalmilk'. Even Piat d'Or is a lot drier than it used to be and, in some of its guises, verges on drinkability. In the last 30 years, we have become a nation of red-wine drinkers. I'd like to think we have become comfortable with the taste of tannin because it's an essential component of most good red wines. Along with acidity, tannin provides backbone and structure, as well as helping a wine to age. Too much tannin can be unpleasant, but provided the dryness is balanced by other things, it's part of what distinguishes red wine from fruit juice. But have we really moved on from sweet reds? I'm not so sure. The majority of the UK's most popular red wines contain noticeable levels of residual sugar. I'm not talking about the smoothness that comes from higher alcohol levels here - remember that alcohol is fermented sugar - but from actual sweetness. Winemakers leave unfermented sugar in their wines because they know that sweetness sells. The leading Australian brands realised this a long time ago. Indeed, sweetness is one reason why mass-market wines from Down Under have been so successful, claiming six of the top 10 brands in the UK. If anything, the top American brands are even more sugary - you should try a bottle of Blossom Hill. The fact that we prefer New World wines to Old World ones (only Piat d'Or is anywhere near the top 10) tells its own story. Sure, they tend to have riper fruit flavours, but they are also sweeter as a rule. Our palates aren't as sweet as those of consumers in the States, where brands like Yellowtail and Kendall Jackson have made a fortune out of residual sugar, but that isn't saying much. It's only my opinion, but I think that sweetness is spreading. The other night I worked my way through a bunch of unsolicited samples. Most were gaggingly sweet - a sip was enough. And, worryingly, they came from a variety of sources, including Chile, Portugal, South Africa and Argentina as well as Australia and the United States. Did these wines taste better than Liebfraumilch tinged with red food dye? The answer was yes, although some of them were truly horrid. In the wine world, I thought we'd moved on from the Seventies. But I am beginning to doubt it. tim.atkin@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
