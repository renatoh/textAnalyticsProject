Cameras will begin following the six-time Olympic gold medal-winner from May, as he starts training for Rio 2016. The film will also look back on his career, during which he has broken world records in the 100m and 200m events. Directors Gabe and Ben Turner, the team behind hit documentaries Class of \u201992 and One Direction: This Is Us, will be behind the camera. The film, which will receive a theatrical release, will be produced by Fulwell 73 and exec-produced by Doyen Group. \u201cI\u2019m excited to start work on this project,\u201d Bolt said. \u201cWhen I met Gabe and Ben and heard about their previous work I felt they would be the right people to tell my story and capture my journey to Rio 2016. It\u2019s going to be a lot of fun.\u201d The pair have history within the sports documentary genre after their 2013 film, Class of \u201992, detailed the rise of some of Manchester United\u2019s most famous and successful players. \u201cBen and I had a real interest in looking at the life of an athlete competing in an individual sport,\u201d said Gabe Turner. \u201cWhen the opportunity arose to do so with the greatest athlete of all time, we leapt at the chance. Usain\u2019s journey over this next year and what he achieves in Rio, will define his legacy and redefine what is possible in his sport. We cannot wait to be with him every step of the way.\u201d Bolt recently announced that he will retire from athletics after the 2017 World Championships in London. He also spoke out this week about Tyson Gay\u2019s doping, saying the athlete should have been banned for life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
