Then please don't call us", "bodyText": "Rising fuel prices and share collapses may worry some, but one low-cost airline was still in a bullish mood last week. Trumpeting an array of statistics, it claimed it was the most reliable performer on criteria that included punctuality, cancellation and lost luggage. Its name? Ryanair. If its somewhat selective statistics were surprising, the next claim must have sent eyebrows shooting to the ceiling across Europe. The figures 'confirm that Ryanair is also number one for customer service'. Laugh? I nearly booked a flight to Baden-Karlsruhe. Chief executive Michael O'Leary once famously said: 'Are we going to say sorry for our lack of customer service? Absolutely not.' Could times have changed? Ryanair says it recorded a mere 0.68 complaints per thousand passengers last April. So I called the one person I know who booked to fly with Ryanair this spring. The chances were more than 1000-1 against, but he had a complaint - in fact, a major one: his route had been scrapped after he'd bought a ticket, and he wasn't able to speak to anyone who would advise him what to do. Was he being fair? After all, Ryanair's website tells you how to complain, if you click far enough: he could have written a long letter explaining his complicated situation, posted it to Ireland and waited for a response in the promised seven days from receipt. I tested this against British Airways' site: one click gave me a phone number; I dialled it and was speaking to an adviser within a minute. To mix two old metaphors: you pay peanuts, you get monkeys who hear no evil. It's just a hunch, but could it be that people don't ring Ryanair to complain because they don't have a number? \u00b7 Gwyn Topham is travel editor of Guardian Unlimited"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
