Critics tried to make sense of the logic that had led Southampton to dismiss Nigel Adkins, a popular manager who had guided his team to the Premier League with successive promotions, and bring in a young Argentinian formerly of Espanyol who had a limited grasp of English. As the veteran Southampton voice Lawrie McMenemy put it at the time: \u201cWith due respect to Pochettino, what does he know about our game?\u201d Southampton\u2019s explanation was that they had handpicked an \u201castute tactician and excellent man-manager\u201d. Four years down the line, with Pochettino expertly pulling Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s strings around the summit of English football and looking like a man in total control of the club as it accelerates along an ambitious route, it is safe to say Southampton\u2019s instincts were very discerning. Pochettino smiles to himself and pats his stomach as he reflects on how the four years in England have impacted on him. \u201cI am fat,\u201d he says, breaking into a bashful smile (he isn\u2019t). \u201cThe new lifestyle in England changed me.\u201d He pauses for a moment to think about what he would today tell the more youthful man who arrived full of determination to grasp the opportunity. \u201cKeep an open mind, open your eyes and try to see. Be curious to learn. To be a manager coming into a new culture you have to be humble, be clever in the way that every culture is completely different. You need to see it and then try to show your ideas.\u201d That blueprint has served him well and over the past two and a half seasons he has seen a sort of personality change at Tottenham. He says the club used to be \u201csome good, some not so good \u2026 Now it is looking like we are the best team in the world.\u201d The sense of self\u2011belief has been recalibrated. Pochettino\u2019s quest for excellence underlines his daily work and that has clearly struck a chord with his players. After a swaggering 4-0 victory over West Brom last weekend, the club\u2019s sixth successive league win, Pochettino only thought about what needed to be better. \u201cOne thing is important \u2013 we are never happy. Always we find something else we need to do, different ways to improve. You will never arrive at perfection \u2013 but you need to try to be perfect.\u201d That idealism could come from the Pep Guardiola school. Tottenham travel on Saturday to Manchester City, who they thrashed earlier in the season, with questions piling up about how Guardiola\u2019s methodology is taking time to transfer to his new club. Not that Pochettino was remotely minded to offer any advice or comparisons about how long it should take anyone to adapt to a new league. \u201cGuardiola won 21 titles. Me still none,\u201d he says. \u201cI have not changed my admiration for him. I understand that you can win or lose in football. But in the process at Man City he needs time. He doesn\u2019t need to show his real quality. He showed enough in Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Sometimes you have to manage expectations \u2013 you cannot win titles after a few months. You have to wait until the end. I am sure Guardiola will fight with Man City at the end for big things.\u201d He would like those sentiments about patience to apply to himself and Tottenham as well. With the sense of upward momentum \u2013 going close last season, the new stadium and sense of growth spurring the club to think big \u2013 Pochettino understands that a trophy would symbolise going to the next level. \u201cWe cannot go in advance of time,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are very young. The squad is very young. I am very young. I am here to try to help the club to achieve big things. We are in a process \u2013 when you are building a stadium it is very difficult \u2013 we have unbelievable players that feel Tottenham. They need time and patience.\u201d But he also cannot resist wanting it now. He lets his guard down enough to imagine how it might feel to win the title, to see it through, especially in this final season at the old White Hart Lane. \u201cIt would be amazing, the most important thing in Tottenham\u2019s history. This season we can feel in every game how excited our fans are to spend time at White Hart Lane. You can imagine how tough it will be in a few months when White Hart Lane doesn\u2019t exist and we have to move to play at Wembley. \u201cIt will be very tough for the people who love Tottenham. This is an extra that the players feel and the way we are playing this season at White Hart Lane you can see we are warriors, that you defend your home, your house. The connection and the energy and the feeling we got in every game at White Hart Lane is amazing. It is very important for us to record and feel that emotion. It will be fantastic for the future because White Hart Lane will be present in our minds and our hearts and our history.\u201d For the present, dishing out another lesson to Manchester City and continuing their highly driven football is the only thing on their minds this weekend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
