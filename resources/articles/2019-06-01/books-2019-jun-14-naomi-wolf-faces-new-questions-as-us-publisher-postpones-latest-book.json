Outrages, which argues that the Obscene Publications Act of 1857 led to a turn against consensual sex between men and an increase in executions for sodomy, was published in the UK on 20 May. Wolf has already acknowledged that the book contains two errors, after an on-air challenge on BBC Radio 3 during which the writer and broadcaster Matthew Sweet told her that she had misunderstood the term \u201cdeath recorded\u201d in historical records as signifying an execution. In fact it denotes the opposite, Sweet pointed out, highlighting that a teenager she said had been \u201cactually executed for sodomy\u201d in 1859 was paroled two years after being convicted. Wolf said last month that she had thanked Sweet for highlighting the mistakes, and was correcting future editions. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt initially stood by plans to publish the book on 18 June in the US, describing the mistake over the executions as an unfortunate error, and declaring: \u201cWe believe the overall thesis of the book Outrages still holds.\u201d But the publisher told the New York Times on Thursday that the book will be delayed. \u201cAs we have been working with Naomi Wolf to make corrections to Outrages, new questions have arisen that require more time to explore,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe are postponing publication and requesting that all copies be returned from retail accounts while we work to resolve those questions.\u201d Wolf said on Friday morning that she strongly objected to the decision to postpone and recall, and that she would \u201cdo all I can to bring Outrages to American readers\u201d. She said she had made necessary changes immediately following her BBC interview, adding that critics had \u201calso introduced errors of their own\u201d. The heart of her book, she said, was \u201cnot criminology \u2026 but censorship\u201d, and \u201cthe chill felt by pioneers such as John Addington Symonds who tried to speak out about love\u201d. Wolf\u2019s UK publisher Virago confirmed on Friday that their edition would remain on sale. \u201cThough the book received excellent reviews it also attracted criticism,\u201d it said, adding that any necessary corrections would be made to future reprints."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
