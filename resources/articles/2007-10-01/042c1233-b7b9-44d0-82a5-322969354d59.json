Robert Lund, 55, a former tree surgeon originally from Darwen in Lancashire, was convicted of killing his second wife Evelyn, 52, whose badly decomposed body was found in a lake two years after she went missing. After a five-day trial in Albi in south-west France, the jury of five men and four women cleared Lund of murder but convicted him of the lesser offence of involuntary homicide, akin to manslaughter, rejecting his claim that his wife had driven into the lake by accident following a bad storm. Outside court, Gerard Wilkinson, Mrs Lund's brother, said nothing would ever compensate the family for the loss of Evelyn. \"However, the family takes some comfort from the verdict,\" he said. \"The family has always believed Mr Lund was responsible for Evelyn's death; we just wish he had it in him to admit this.\" The court heard that Lund had subjected his wife to a sustained campaign of mental and physical abuse. The prosecution argued that Lund killed his wife and tried to make the crime look like an accident so he could live off her life insurance. The couple were living in the remote village of Rayssac, near Toulouse in south-west France, when Mrs Lund fled to the house of a friend after arguing with her husband. Lund had always claimed that his wife must have taken the wrong turning in the woods because of the stormy conditions and poor visibility on December 29 1999. He did not report her missing for three days. She was not seen again until 2001, when a horse rider spotted the red roof of a vehicle in the Lac Bancali\u00e9, 15 miles from Rayssac. After a hot dry summer, the water level had dropped by about 10 metres (more than 30ft), exposing the 4x4 Toyota Land Cruiser. Inside the vehicle police found the badly decomposing body of Mrs Lund along with traces of blood on the front and back seats. A postmortem failed to establish the cause of death, but a pathologist said Mrs Lund was probably dead when she entered the water. Lund, who was arrested and charged in 2004 following police tests on the car, maintained his innocence, but during the trial Mr Barthe, the examining magistrate, said that Lund had lied when he told police that his wife had not come home after the argument. Under French law Lund now has 10 days to appeal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
