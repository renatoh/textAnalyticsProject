Hodgson is sending his assistant, Ray Lewington, to West Ham's game against Newcastle United on Saturday with the specific instruction to see how Carroll does against his former club. Carroll has not been involved with England since being an unused substitute in the 1-1 World Cup qualifier against Poland in October but has scored four times in his past five league matches. The on-loan Liverpool player is still prominent in Hodgson's thinking. Hodgson made Carroll an integral part of his plans in last summer's European Championship and is now thinking ahead to the end-of-season friendlies against the Republic of Ireland and Brazil. However, there are no immediate plans for Hodgson to check how Terry is playing, either in the second leg of the Europa League semi-final against Basel at Stamford Bridge on Thursday or when Chelsea play at Manchester United on Sunday. Instead, Hodgson is travelling to Miami to look at potential pre-World Cup bases, continuing to take the optimistic outlook despite England being behind Montenegro in their qualifying group. Gary Neville, another member of the England backroom staff, will be at the game as a television analyst and may report back on Terry and Ferdinand."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
