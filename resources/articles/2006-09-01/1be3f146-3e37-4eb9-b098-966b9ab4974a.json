In the case of winner Roger Eigenheer, much of this movement has been uphill. He stopped selling second-hand bicycles to concentrate on training for L'Etape du Tour, in which amateurs cycle a stage of the Tour de France. On July 10, he was one of 7,548 cyclists riding one of the toughest stages of the tour, the 119-mile stretch from Gap to L'Alpe d'Huez. It included two summits and several miles of steep, zig-zagging road up to the finishing line. Eigenheer took 10 hours and four minutes to become one of 5,477 to complete the race. \"I was pleased to finish,\" he says. Training took up the weekend spare time he had used to run the eBay business: \"Pretty much every Sunday from the end of the competition onwards was a six- to eight-hour bike ride.\" With a promotion at work, Eigenheer says he does not have time to return to trading on eBay, but adds: \"I do think there are opportunities in the future.\" He still uses the site for buying cycling goods. Clare Tomkins has continued to develop her eBay-based business, selling personalised children's bags and associated items, since the competition ended. Her feedback rating is around 300, compared with 130 in March, and as Business Sense went to press she had retained a 100% positive feedback score. Indeed, the business has been going a bit too well: \"We got back from a week away on holiday and every item that was up for auction in the shop had been bought,\" she says. \"I had 12 bags to do. I re-listed and they were all bought again.\" To allow her to spend time with her children over the summer holidays she stopped listing items requiring personalisation. But she continued to receive emails asking for bags, with increasing demands for customisation. \"In the beginning people were happy to have what I was selling,\" says Tomkins. \"But now, people are saying, 'it needs to be a red bag with a pocket', or, 'it needs to be 100 by 170cm in royal blue, double-lined so it can take football boots'.\" She has developed pricing for such extras - she prefers fixed, \"buy it now\" sales to auctions - but still lists such customised orders on eBay. This provides her with some protection over disputed payments, but can also mean that someone other than the person who emailed the request can buy it - meaning she makes two similar items. Although Tomkins says eBay's dispute system has helped her get payment in almost all cases, she has avoided \"unpaid item strikes\", reporting an eBay user for non-payment. This is to protect her own online reputation, although she says she gets the odd grumble from buyers who haven't read the description properly. Change in policy A change in eBay's policies has also damaged Tomkins' sales: at the start of August, the site reduced the visibility of items for sale in its online shops, which cost sellers at least \u00a36 a month but allow items to be listed from 3p each, compared with the usual 15p minimum listing fee. The change means that shop items appear in a search only if few normally-listed items are found. Tomkins says this hasn't caused problems with personalised bags - they are fairly unusual, so her shop items still appear. But it has badly hit sales of children's books and Fairtrade children's clothes (which she buys, rather than makes): \"I've sold one book in six weeks. I used to sell six a week,\" she says, and she is unlikely to buy further stock. Although Tomkins says she plans to run her business as a part-time job in future, she does have a new idea: baby bunting, with names spelt out on the flags. She has already made a test batch: \"I've only seen one kind of personalised bunting on eBay, and it doesn't look as good.\" Denice Purdie, who runs Purdie's Scottish Soap Company with her husband, has also retained her eBay shop, but mainly as a way of getting the attention of retailers. As well as providing visibility through eBay itself, the shop also does well in search engine rankings: \"It's even cheaper than Google,\" she says, comparing it to the search engine's paid-for AdWords service. \"Google loves eBay.\" The Purdies, who live in the small village of Colintraive on Scotland's west coast, have been concentrating on large orders from retailers, including the Clan Albanach chain of kilt-makers, distillery visitor centres such as those for the Macallan and Glengoyne whiskies, as well as the shops of the National Trust of Scotland and the country's tourist board, VisitScotland. Last autumn, the Purdies were distributing their goods through 18 retailers. That figure has now risen to 96, and Denice Purdie says the business is three times the size it was a year ago. This means they can move forward with their plans to expand local manufacturing. \"We've got a plot in hand, and we're hoping to get a soapery up,\" says Denice Purdie. \"We're hoping to employ people with learning difficulties in our area.\" They are applying for a grant from Highlands and Islands Enterprise, which promotes the area's economic and social development, and have already received one from Scotland Unlimited, which supports social entrepreneurs. They are also planning a new range where 5% of the price will go to Cancer Research Scotland. As well as being socially worthwhile, this will help get across the purity of their products, Purdie says. \"We've started this business with nothing carcinogenic.\" Purdie's Scottish Soap Company will focus mainly on selling through retailers rather than direct to customers online, even if eBay does serve as a virtual shop window. But Purdie says she continues to use the site for purchasing, both for the business - it is a good place to find small quantities of supplies such as candle equipment, ribbons and packaging - and for their new house. Wrong product By the end of the competition, both Stuart Reed and Paul Edwards, selling sporting goods and conservatories respectively, had come to the conclusion that their businesses were not well-suited to eBay. Reed, now working as an online trading consultant, says he may try starting an eBay business again, but adds that he needs more funding to buy goods in bulk at cheaper prices. \"I think the downside of what I was doing was wrong product, wrong price,\" he says. Paul Edwards agrees with Denice Purdie that eBay is a good form of advertising: he reckons some conservatory companies run shops on the site that sell little or nothing, purely to generate leads. \"There's nowhere else you could get national advertising for \u00a3100,\" he says, but that amount a month pays for a substantial eBay presence. After the competition, Edwards experienced a serious setback when developing a new online business to sell custom-built doors. A few weeks after he started trading in April, a larger company contacted him, asserting its right to his domain name as it had taken a similar trademark around the time he had bought the online name. \"The first thing anyone should do with the name of a company is trademark it,\" says Edwards. \"Then you can't go wrong.\" Without a trademark, and without the funding for a legal battle or a strong alternative domain name and a new round of marketing, he decided to cut his losses. Instead, he opened a trade outlet for builders in Hertfordshire for doors, conservatories and windows, as well as undertaking custom installation work for the public. Business is expanding, and Edwards is looking for venture capital funding. He has a new product: integral blinds for conservatories, where the blind is held between the two sheets of double glazed windows. He has gone directly to the Patent Office to apply for a trademark, rather than through a solicitor, and says the staff are helpful and fees are fairly low. He says he might return to eBay, although primarily as a method of advertising. But he reckons it is better suited to businesses adapted from hobbies, rather than large-scale enterprises. \"It seems people fall into it,\" Edwards says. \"I think it's difficult to launch a business on eBay - it's easier to turn a hobby into a business.\" Weblinks Clare Tomkins' eBay store: http://stores.ebay.co.uk/back-to-school Denice Purdie's eBay store: http://stores.ebay.co.uk/purdies-the-scottish-soap-company Paul Edwards' trade outlet for builders: www.tfstrade.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
