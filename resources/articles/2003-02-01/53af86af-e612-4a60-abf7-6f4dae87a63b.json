They were brave, decisive and dignified, three adjectives that had remained in the pavilion before the Zimbabwe Two came on to the field. The next day the England and Wales Cricket Board, still fretting about England's fixture in Harare, padded up to discuss what they would do, or not do. Of the hundreds of thousands of words written about the most talked-about cricket fixture of modern times, these, taken from the Daily Telegraph's report of the ECB meeting, are perhaps the saddest: 'The England Cricket Board have consulted a leading QC in London and are engaging counsel in Cape Town. The Board's director of legal affairs, Mark Roper-Drimie, said: \"We reserve our position on the statement that the match was cancelled\".' Well played, sir! A magnificent piece of position-reserving. Right up there with the Prime Minister's off-the-record briefing - 'You mustn't play, but don't blame me' - in December. We're not so good at cricket, but the English are world class at calling in the lawyers and passing the buck. Nobody was prepared to take the decision, nor the blame, and it was always going to come to this: a hefty profit for the lawyers, and a far bigger loss for everybody else, from individual players to administrative bodies to international sport as a whole. Where will the next boycott be? The government first informed the ECB, privately, of their disquiet last summer, but when ministers started speaking openly in December, the sports minister, Richard Caborn, said: 'If all the conditions are right for the match to take place as far as the ICC are concerned, then they make the decision, not politicians.' A pity he did not reiterate that view in the past two weeks. Michael Ancram, the Conservative, disagreed with Caborn and said that Robert Mugabe, as president of the Zimbabwe Cricket Union, was 'in a position to take PR and financial advantage' from the match. Other Labour politicians agreed with Ancram, rather than Caborn. The Prime Minister let it be known that he was against, and Clare Short and Tessa Jowell urged the ECB to withdraw from their commitment. It became a truism that the game would 'give support' to Mugabe's regime. Only last week a Times columnist wrote: 'English cricket, by its presence, would have been shoring up the rule of a mass murderer.' Really? Since it was first aired last year, nobody seems to have questioned the 'support for Mugabe' view when the opposite was just as likely to be the case: playing the game would have provided an opportunity to highlight the problems in Zimbabwe to the wider world (or at least the part of it where cricket is newsworthy). Had England's cricketers travelled to Harare and made some sort of gesture against the regime, Mugabe would have been the loser by a distance. England could have competed with honour while dishonouring Mugabe. If the \u00a3500-an-hour legalspeak has been the low point, these words, also from the Telegraph , were more uplifting on Thursday: 'Holland have decided to go to Zimbabwe despite opposition by the Dutch government.' The president of the Dutch cricket board made a good point. If, say, a team were to boycott Zimbabwe, then every subsequent tour would imply they were condoning the host country's regime. 'What about Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka?' he asked. It is also worth recalling that England toured Pakistan, where the military had deposed the elected government, in 2001. The country had been suspended from the Commonwealth and accused by Amnesty International of horrific human rights abuse. WHO TO BLAME for the mess? The players dithered, camping on the moral high ground then bringing the argument down to one of personal security. At least they have been sincere, and one could argue that they have been morally courageous in boycotting Mugabe, and that others' refusal to follow makes their decision all the more praiseworthy. Conversely, one might say that they, and their foghorn spokesman Richard Bevan, should have taken a lead from the Zimbabwe captain. It would have contravened regulations, but better a bit of naughtiness on the pitch in Harare than no game at all. Bevan appears to have furthered his own cause within the players' union while getting up everybody else's nose with his bellicose pronouncements. We've heard enough from him. And nothing at all, sadly, from England's coach, the Zimbabwean Duncan Fletcher. The ICC have taken plenty of flak. The public face of the game's world body has been misleading: two Australian suits in front of the cameras. Of the 10 Test-playing nations, seven are from the developing world. Cricket is unique in this respect - England are unlikely to play football in Zimbabwe, or rugby in Pakistan. The majority are not inclined to see things from England's perspective, a reality that the English board, and players, seem unable to grasp, or accept. Social cricket is a wonderful part of English culture; our role in world cricket is an embarrassment. Why are English sporting bodies (and, often, the media) so insular, especially when it comes to the developing world? A year ago, Geoff Thompson, chairman of the Football Association, flew to Mali to address a gathering of Fifa luminaries on the eve of the African Cup of Nations, the continent's biggest football tournament. The night before the opening game, Thompson - with a chaperone, laughably - flew home. An honoured guest, a great chance to meet people... and straight from the microphone to the airport without attending a single match. Of course, the Africans were mightily insulted - not that anyone from the FA was aware of it. They probably still aren't, unlike the South African sports minister, who was in Mali and has been outspoken against the ECB in the Zimbabwe affair. And when South Africa and Zimbabwe say, as they have done, that they are worried about their cricketers' security in Britain this summer, it would be unwise to patronise them. They have a point - but so might any sportsman fear for his safety in any number of countries, which is why it is not easy to see this as a straightforward matter of security. The ECB have lacked leadership. England played in Zimbabwe 18 months ago without a problem. Tim Lamb, the ECB's chief executive, was among the ICC delegation that travelled to Zimbabwe only last November to report back favourably on the security situation. Lamb, admittedly an easy target, has looked weak, indecisive, and has been praised by nobody. While some can argue with hindsight, he is paid for his foresight. He has had none. His chairman, David Morgan, looked foolish when he said that throughout the affair the ECB had been 'trying desperately to keep the world of cricket united'. As for the politicians, are we to believe that, because of their moral values, Jowell and Short have all the answers? Why save all their outrage over Mugabe for a cricket fixture? There is a widely held view that sport and politics don't mix. They do: the problem is sport and politicians. The decision not to play sets an unwelcome precedent? The next boycott cannot be far away, for there are enough despotic regimes around the world to compile a league table. Mugabe's would be near the top, along with China's. Will the 2008 Olympics in Beijing take place? It's time for a government briefing about that. And the lawyers can start rubbing their hands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
