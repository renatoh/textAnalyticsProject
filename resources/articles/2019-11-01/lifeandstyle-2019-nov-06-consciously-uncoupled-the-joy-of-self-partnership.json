If we were lucky, they said, we would meet a prince or princess and live happily ever after. If not, we would tread a lonely road to the grave, with only cats to comfort us. But an increasing number of \u201csingle-positive\u201d people are rejecting the notion that true love is the only path to happiness. Just this week, the actor Emma Watson told Vogue how a \u201cbloody influx of subliminal messaging\u201d had left her \u201cstressed and anxious\u201d because she was heading into her 30s without a husband and baby. Now, however, she is \u201cvery happy\u201d to be single. \u201cI call it being self-partnered.\u201d The pop star Selena Gomez, meanwhile, whose single-positive songs include Lose You to Love Me and Look at Her Now, has been talking about the fun she has had as a \u201csuper, super single\u201d woman since splitting up with Justin Bieber two years ago. On Twitter, fellow singer Ariana Grande called the time since her split with Pete Davidson \u201cone hell of a productive, emotional, wild and yet ... happy! year\u201d. And as for Lizzo, currently touring the UK, she is proud to say she puts the \u201csing in single\u201d. As she put it in her 2017 hit Truth Hurts: \u201cI will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick \u2026 Ain\u2019t worried \u2019bout a ring on my finger.\u201d Nor is Abi Jackson, 37, who fell in love with the single life in 2015 after the end of a five-year engagement. \u201cFocusing on what you can gain from being single rather than what you\u2019re missing is extremely empowering,\u201d says the London-based writer. \u201cI took up cycling as a hobby and absolutely loved it, which I might not have discovered if I hadn\u2019t been single and pushing myself to try new things.\u201d She has more time to focus on relationships with friends and family, as well as community activities such as volunteering with the Scouts. \u201cWe need to start saying: \u2018You are enough as a single person\u2019, otherwise it can start to define you.\u201d Like a growing number of single women, Jackson says she takes herself out on dates. \u201cSome people seem to think going to the cinema or having dinner by yourself is weird, but it\u2019s brilliant. I dress up and really make the most of my night. I won\u2019t hide away in the corner or apologise for being on my own.\u201d Although she hasn\u2019t ruled out being in a relationship, Jackson says dating turned her into a caricature. \u201cIt felt like I was being reduced to funny anecdotes about bad dates and failed flings. It\u2019s easy to become hyperaware of that fairytale narrative, especially for women, but I don\u2019t think being single should be framed around looking for love. It\u2019s about developing a positive relationship with yourself.\u201d Having dabbled with dating apps since 2017, it\u2019s a feeling with which I\u2019m familiar. While it\u2019s easy to meet people online, I\u2019ve always found it hard to make a real connection. There are only so many times I can swipe left on men called Zed who pose topless in their nan\u2019s living room. Instead of sitting through another mediocre round of drinks with a teetotal accountant preparing for his next Tough Mudder, I would rather spend time doing the things I love. Whether that\u2019s going to the theatre, visiting the farmers\u2019 market or creating new recipes with my pretentious, overpriced vegetables, it feels more empowering to invest in your own passions. No one wants to end up like Bridget Jones, that vodka-slurping poster child for miserable spinsters. In 2018, the author Catherine Gray published a book about how her search for happiness had led her to take a year off dating. And what did she call it? The Unexpected Joy of Being Single. Danielle Wrate, 43, an editor and publisher, is also happy on her own. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve found a way to enjoy your own company and go out alone, it\u2019s liberating,\u201d she says. \u201cThe stigma of being out alone is dying out. I see lots of people doing things by themselves now. I travel alone and get the best of both worlds, because I can always join day trips when I want some company.\u201d Wrate is part of a local group called Sinkies, which stands for Single Income, No Kids. It was set up by a single woman who wanted to improve her social life; there are regular pub quizzes, hikes and Sunday lunches. \u201cThere are a lot of members and it\u2019s open to both sexes, but only women ever turn up.\u201d This is indeed a trend that is largely led by women. But Rob Smith, 36, who runs a property development business on the south coast of England, points out that maintaining a happy relationship with yourself is just as important for men. \u201cI\u2019ve been single for five years and I\u2019m very comfortable with it. I had a job that required me to travel frequently and I value my independence, freedom and flexibility,\u201d he says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been able to have a lot of the experiences I have had if I was in a relationship.\u201d However, when his family started making jokes about his single status and pressuring him to settle down, he began to internalise their negativity. \u201cI ended up going on a dating spree to try and find someone, which made me really unhappy.\u201d After some soul-searching, he came to the conclusion that he was happier alone than trying to force a romance out of thin air. \u201cI deleted all the apps and decided to go back to enjoying my single life.\u201d He confronted his relatives about the comments they had been making, and asked them to respect his decision to be single. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s as much pressure on men to settle down as there is for women, but it definitely exists. I\u2019m very happy with my life and I needed my family to understand that.\u201d Although he is open to the idea of having his own family in future, he says it will not affect his happiness. \u201cMen are lucky because they have the option of having children much later,\u201d he says. \u201cI suppose that might be an added challenge for women.\u201d According to Paul Dolan, a behavioural scientist from the London School of Economics, traditional benchmarks of adulthood such as marriage and children don\u2019t always correlate with increased happiness. In fact, research included in his latest book, Happy Ever After, shows that women who remain single and child-free actually live longer, happier and healthier lives. Yet negative stereotypes about single women in particular can be pernicious. \u201cLook at how Jennifer Aniston was portrayed for years,\u201d says Jackson. \u201cShe was on the cover of every magazine as the woman who couldn\u2019t get a man. The reality is she\u2019s beautiful, successful and has an incredible life. She never needed our pity \u2013 and nor do other single women.\u201d Kate Bolick, 47, author of Spinster: Making a Life of One\u2019s Own, couldn\u2019t agree more. Part memoir, part social history, the book follows the lives of five single women at the turn of the last century, including the social reformer Charlotte Perkins Gilman and poet Edna St Vincent Millay. \u201cThroughout history, whenever women have been allowed more educational, vocational and economic opportunities, they have delayed marriage or rejected it altogether,\u201d Bolick says. Marriage rates have certainly been dropping in the UK, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. In 2015 there were 239,020 marriages between opposite-sex couples, down 3.4% on the previous year. \u201cMany single women are fine the way they are,\u201d says Bolick. \u201cIt is important that we show this reality so that singles can be seen accurately.\u201d To reflect that reality, Nicola Slawson, 35, a journalist from Shropshire, set up the Single Supplement, a newsletter for single women. \u201cA lot of the content aimed at women is condescending and negative,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about what to do with your partner or how to get a partner if you don\u2019t have one. The assumption that being in a relationship is the norm is really infuriating. So I aim to write about the things that really matter to single women \u2013 everything from self-acceptance to practical issues like money management on a single income.\u201d Like Wrate, Slawson is an advocate of solo travel. \u201cI was advised against going to Morocco by myself as a single woman,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I went anyway and had one of the best experiences of my life. You have to be careful, of course, but don\u2019t let other people\u2019s assumptions and ideals put you off doing something you want to do.\u201d For others, a positive approach to singledom involves more than travelling alone or taking themselves out on dates. In 2015, Sophie Tanner, a digital consultant from Brighton, decided to embrace \u201csologamy\u201d, the act of marrying oneself. \u201cIt was a slightly tongue-in-cheek statement against the stigma of being single. But people were incredibly supportive and took it seriously.\u201d Tanner\u2019s spiritual ceremony, which was presided over by a friend, was followed by a reception with her friends and family. By prioritising her relationship with herself, she says, she has developed as a person and found greater self-acceptance and happiness. \u201cIt was great to celebrate, because unless you marry or have children, there are no opportunities to celebrate your own happiness in adult life.\u201d This year Tanner released her novel Reader, I Married Me, loosely based on her experiences of sologamy. \u201cIt\u2019s an anti-romcom, where the character embraces the power of being on her own,\u201d she says. Although she believes romantic love can bring happiness, Tanner maintains that having a positive relationship with yourself is more important. \u201cIt feels like there are more couples who are settling than those who are truly compatible. People could surprise themselves by realising how happy they could be on their own.\u201d In a world geared up for couples, it\u2019s easy to subscribe to the sad-single-female rhetoric that society thrusts in our direction. I was heartbroken when I split up with my last boyfriend after 16 months, but I quickly realised it saved me from the type of mediocre relationship that Tanner describes. Except for the days where I\u2019m waging a one-woman war against a fitted sheet, I\u2019m now much happier on my own. \u201cAs a society we are obsessed with finding the One,\u201d Tanner says. \u201cWe tend to believe we can\u2019t be fully happy unless we have that, which is just not true. It\u2019s not the norm for people to find their soulmate, but because we put so much pressure on the importance of being with someone, people lower their expectations or put up with average or even toxic relationships.\u201d Now 40, Tanner loves having time for her hobbies. \u201cI enjoy solitude; I love reading, writing and walking my dog by the sea.\u201d She doesn\u2019t get lonely. \u201cLoneliness is an emotional response to feeling unloved and unseen, which can happen in or out of a relationship. It\u2019s about feeling misunderstood or lacking connection. Happy solitude means you are comfortable in your own skin.\u201d She says she is not bothered by the thought that she may never have children. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have children to complete you, in the same way that you don\u2019t need a partner.\u201d All you need, in fact, is self-belief. \u201cI don\u2019t see the point in apologising for existing as a single woman or sitting around feeling like I am waiting for my life to start,\u201d says Slawson. \u201cI just want to get out there and live it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
