This delicious but uncomfortable truth echoes down the years to our own celebrity-obsessed and gossip-hungry times, in Natasha Betteridge's fine production that straddles the 18th and 21st centuries with louche ease. Sheridan's play can all too easily be a case of theatrical style over substance. On stage is a familiar stock of post-Restoration characters, from the elderly Sir Peter Teazle who has foolishly taken a young wife and is now being led a merry dance, to the apparently dissolute rake who turns out to be a fine chap. Too many fops gathered on one stage is commonly known as a flop. Or sometimes a panto. But Betteridge's production cleverly negotiates the pitfalls with a playful, high-spirited and stylish approach. It makes its points firmly but lightly as it reflects 18th-century society back upon ourselves through the prism of Sheridan's vicious wit. From the opening moments in which white-gloved fingers, seemingly unattached to limbs or torsos, are seen perusing copies of Hello!, we are in both past and present. Only those without a malicious bone in their bodies, and whose lips are permanently sealed against gossip, escape the finger of retribution. The evening has plenty of good funny business that adds to rather than distracts from Sheridan's own poisonous wit, and the only complaint you can make about some of the visual jokes is that they extend what is already a pretty long evening. But you certainly get your money's worth, not least from Sam Troughton's scheming Joseph, an angel with the dirtiest of souls. Patrick Toomy plays Joseph's brother Charles with easy charm and Susan Bovell's Lady Sneerwell is such a mad cow it is a delight to see her end up as Bovril. \u0095 Until October 6.
