Permira, whose chairman, Damon Buffini, became a hate figure for trades unions at the peak of the buyout boom two years ago, said it was making the reduction because falling markets and a drought of takeover prospects had prompted some investors to scale back commitments. The buyout industry has suffered a swift fall from grace as the value of many of the businesses it purchased during the stockmarket boom has plunged. Investors are also keen to pull back on commitments to buyout funds as they are forced by falling markets to raise cash. David Currie, chief executive officer of SL Capital Partners, which oversees about \u20ac6.3bn of private equity investments for the insurer Standard Life, said: \"They were doing some of the biggest deals around and there are going to be few, if any, of those deals in the next few years. \"They recognise the size of the fund is bigger than what they can deploy over its remaining life.\" Customers would cut their pledges to the fund by 40%, according to SVG Capital, Permira's biggest investor. The plan would reduce the fund to \u20ac9.5bn. Those accepting Permira's offer will forgo a quarter of the profit from asset sales but will still pay the fund's management fee in full. The firm has already spent half the fund's capital. Buyout firms have announced $201bn (\u00a3138bn) of takeovers worldwide this year, less than a third of the total in the same period last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
