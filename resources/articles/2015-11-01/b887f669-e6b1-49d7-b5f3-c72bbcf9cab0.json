Jennifer Lawrence recently publicly attacked the gender pay gap in the industry in an essay that went viral. And over the weekend, Sharon Stone recalled weeping over unequal salaries more than 20 years ago, following the release of Basic Instinct. On Sunday in Los Angeles, during a panel discussion dedicated to independent film at AFI festival, actor Olivia Wilde joined the chorus, recounting the hurdles she went through to get a female-led production financed independently. Wilde recently starred in Meadowland, a low-budget drama on which she also served as producer. The film, from first-time director Reed Morano (a well-regarded cinematographer who worked on Kill Your Darlings, Frozen River and The Skeleton Twins), centers on the self-destructive path a mother (Wilde) sets out on shortly after her child goes missing. It premiered at the Tribeca film festival in the spring to good reviews, and was released a few months later. Wilde said that despite her considerable clout as a star and Morano\u2019s promise as a film-maker, it was \u201cshockingly difficult\u201d to finance the film initially. \u201cMorano is just a rock star in the [film] world, so I thought it\u2019d be a breeze,\u201d Wilde said. \u201cIf I were investing in films, I\u2019d want to invest in a director who\u2019s worked on all these films, and really knew her way around on a set. \u201cIt was hard not to assume it had something to do with gender: we were [making a] female-directed, female-produced story about a female.\u201d Wilde said that financing only came together once she and Reed secured Wilde\u2019s male co-star in the film, Luke Wilson. Wilde is arguably the lead of Reed\u2019s film; Wilson, playing her husband, has considerably less screen time. \u201cAt the time I heard this shocking story that when Julianne Moore was getting Still Alice put together, she said: \u2018Don\u2019t bother going out for financing until you hire the male lead\u2019,\u201d Wilde added. \u201cI was shocked by that. I thought: that\u2019s Julianne fucking Moore!\u201d Moore won the Oscar for best actress this year for her performance in that drama. Wilde said the experience of getting Meadowland made served as a \u201creal education in indie film financing. \u201cI hope that because we made such a beautiful film, that it will encourage financiers to take that risk with a little less drama.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
