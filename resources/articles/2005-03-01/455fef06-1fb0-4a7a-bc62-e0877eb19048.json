Hellos are easy, goodbyes can be sad and clunky. Travel's about shuffling, spinning and chasing shadows, moving on. Communities are built on people staying put, doing the right thing. But it doesn't matter if you're a scout or teamaker, if you stick or run. We're all travelling in our own way. Yesterday I talked to a lady of 86. I was the first person she'd spoken to that day. That was her opening line. She was sitting, grey and old, on a chair, drinking from a cup, not quite invisible. We were at a swimming pool - or aquatic centre, as they're called here. It was big and new. Going for a swim? I asked. She shook her head, then said, No, but my late husband did. That's all she had to say. She'd travelled years and miles. I've had emails asking me to use bigger words, flossy, flowery, contorted-in-the-back-of-your-mouth words, words that show others how intelligent you are. I sent an email back saying I only had a vocabulary of 700, and like a poker player I shuffle the crumpled pack. Someone else wanted me to find out about Vietnam's GDP and the effects of Napalm. Another wanted the family to get rabies, didn't like what we'd written about dogs. But never get a dog-lover angry. You should see Billie's snarling teeth. Others, more generous, thanked me and made me feel oh-look-at-me-ish. What I do is thank you all. Thank you for reading, showing interest. I've been told it's a blog, so now I'm a blogger, not a fist-thumping monster, sitting in my black taxi box. Every day you find something new. Today it was a bird called the jabiroo. The Tasmanian Devil apparently eats its young if they annoy it. My guess is young Tazzies don't argue. Mine do, but we struggle on, pointing fingers, spitting, shouting, howling like dogs, but we laugh as well. Travel gets the juices running hot. We've shared it all. Etta's take I've enjoyed the trip so far, but I can never think about the next day. I wish I had written more, but I'm concentrating on the travelling. Because I might never get to do this again - well, that's what Mum and Dad say. Bye-bye, sweetie pies. Billie's take We're tracking people back, old friends who we haven't seen in years - well, some I've never seen. Thank you, my readers. I even get emails saying Dear Billie. I'm a star. But I want to go back to school now, back to a routine, back to my friends. Thank you thank you thank you very much, like Elvis said on the first day of our trip. This is the last - well, nearly the last. The last of writing for you lot. It's been a great trip, an experience. Like everyone says, you're so lucky. But it's just annoying when people ask, What's your favourite place? How can there be a favourite place? It's just different. Bye bye. Tracy's take Goodbye to you, whoever you are. Thanks for the feedback, good and bad. If I'd had more time I'd have replied, but we've been moving. We'll keep on moving. Next stop, New Zealand - then who knows? Does travelling without an itinerary make me itinerant? All of us have grown good at going with the flow, the girls can hang anywhere, make friends with strangers in strange places, map-read, spot sharks, rays, and sea turtles from clifftops, eat ice cream in many languages and communicate in all. I'm glad we came away. I hope we do it again one day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
