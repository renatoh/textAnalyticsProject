Gayle's disenchantment, in an exclusive interview with the Guardian in which he indicated that he could exist quite happily on a diet of highly lucrative Twenty20 cricket, has plunged Test cricket into a fresh crisis of confidence, with the England and Wales Cricket Board already bracing itself for one of the lowest opening-day Test crowds in modern times. There were calls from the Caribbean yesterday for Gayle to be replaced. Dr Julian Hunte, president of the board, also said that he would seek an immediate explanation. \"This is bound to have an effect on the whole spirit of the team,\" he said. \"It's an unfortunate development.\" Gayle, 29, was a chastened figure yesterday as he emphasised that his preference for Twenty20 above Test cricket was an assessment of his own career, which is now reaching its final years. He insisted that he had no immediate plans to abandon Tests or the West Indies captaincy and said there was no conflict within the team following his late arrival from the IPL only two days before last week's Lord's Test, lost by them in less than three days. Strauss needs no persuading of the superiority of Test cricket. When he readily agreed that he had \"a duty\" to protect the five-day game at a critical juncture in its history, as Twenty20 cricket threatens to sweep all before it, he might have been an ECB chief executive in waiting. \"I certainly feel that Test cricket is the primary format of the game,\" he said. \"The majority of cricketers around the world feel that and certainly all the cricketers in the England team feel that as well. \"I believe very strongly that Test cricket should continue to be the No1 format. It is the only game that really tests out your temperament, your technique, your hunger, your bravery \u2013 all those aspects of the game. And the fact that it is such a subtle game makes it, for me, a far better game to play in than the other formats.\" That the rewards of IPL will encourage players to retire from Test cricket earlier is inevitable, but Gayle's startling disregard for the longest form of the game might be the first sign of a deeper malaise among some of those who play the game. Strauss rejected any suggestion that the malaise has infected the England team. \"Test cricket is slightly vulnerable at the moment, when you look at the security system around the world,\" he said. \"It is important that we play good Test cricket to make people aware of what a good format it is and how entertaining it can be. From a players' point of view, we need to provide that entertainment and that means playing aggressive, positive cricket more often than not. \"It is not my job to convince anyone that plays the game about Test cricket. What is my job is to make sure that all 11 players are 100% focused and committed to playing in that format and I am convinced that is the case with the England team. I don't think there has been any talk within the England team of any format being more important than Test cricket.\" Strauss voluntarily conceded the England Twenty20 captaincy because the short form of the game is not his forte, and it was his implied criticism of Gayle's last-minute arrival before the Lord's Test that exposed the disillusionment of his rival captain. He laughed off Gayle's suggestions that he was obsessed with protecting Test cricket's future because it was the only form of the game that he could play. \"Maybe he is right about that,\" he said. \"He was playing in the IPL and being paid a fortune for it and I was back in England playing a four-dayer for Middlesex. But if Test cricket is the primary form of the game, I feel that it needs to get the attention it deserves in terms of preparation and my views haven't changed on that.\" Gayle was at pains to expand upon his views. \"Test cricket is always going to be there, but I don't see myself playing Test cricket for any long period of time. Twenty20 has come on board and has made a huge impact, and it's brilliant and games have been sold out. \"There is a lot of cricket being played and I'm starting to develop a lot of injuries. It takes toll on your body and your mental strength. When I can't get that passion about Test cricket, I will stop. But I haven't come across that feeling just yet. I shared my views and that's how it is. You only have one life. Everyone should respect how someone feels.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
