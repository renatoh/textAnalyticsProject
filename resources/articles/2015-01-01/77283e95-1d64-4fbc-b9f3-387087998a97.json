People say: \u2018She couldn\u2019t have run 2:15 clean\u2019 and I know I can be totally proud. I can\u2019t understand how other people who have cheated can stand there and look their competitors and family in the eye.\u201d Radcliffe is talking passionately \u2013 as always \u2013 about how a spate of high-profile doping cases among distance runners has seeded an even greater amount of doubt and suspicion in the sport she loves. Cases such as Liliya Shobukhova, the second-fastest women\u2019s marathon runner of all time behind Radcliffe, who was banned in 2014 because of irregularities with her blood passport. And cases such as Rita Jeptoo, the 2013 and 2014 Boston and Chicago marathon winner, who is one of around 40 Kenyan athletes who have been banned in the past two years. Then there were the stunning allegations about systematic doping in Russia, broadcast by the German TV station WDR, at the end of 2014 but denied by the Russian athletics authorities. \u201cYou knew there was some kind of problem but the scale of it was a shock,\u201d says Radcliffe. \u201cYou have to be careful because it hasn\u2019t been proven yet.\u201d The 41-year-old Radcliffe has been one of the strongest advocates for clean sport for more than two decades but such are the levels of distrust in the sport, she even hears whispers about whether her world marathon record of 2:15.25 was set cleanly. \u201cOn the one hand you can say: \u2018People can say what they want because I know inside\u2019 but still it\u2019s not nice to have people saying that,\u201d she admits. Does it get to her? \u201cYes. It does make you angry and it does make you think we have to put a system in place that protects those athletes. And also so that people watching can believe in it.\u201d As Radcliffe prepares to draw the curtain on her career she says she is willing to play a greater role with the IAAF or anti-doping agencies. \u201cYou can\u2019t just moan about something,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you are going to have strong views you might as well get involved in actually doing something proactively to back it up. \u201cAs an athlete you identify with what people are going through. There will be some Russians athletes who are not cheating, there are a lot of Kenyan athletes out there who are not cheating and they are all being lumped together. It spoils it so we have to do something to protect that and protect the sport.\u201d But Radcliffe says she will not be following the lead of the former sprinter Darren Campbell, who admitted this month that he would not encourage his kids to take up athletics because \u201cit was very hard to keep believing in the sport\u201d in the wake of the WDR documentary. She says: \u201cI want my kids to pick their sport but if they said it was athletics I would love it. I do think it\u2019s a beautiful sport and it\u2019s given me so much.\u201d Her seven-year-old daughter, Isla, is showing signs of promise, admits Radcliffe, although at this stage her preference is gymnastics. \u201cIt\u2019s funny because my husband, Gary, thinks I\u2019m a pushy mum so I asked Isla and she said: \u2018No you\u2019re not but you do make me do my homework a lot,\u2019\u201d she jokes. \u201cWith [her son] Ralph it is too young to tell but when he runs I can tell in his eyes it\u2019s just basic pure pleasure in running.\u201d It is a pleasure that Radcliffe, who will make her valedictory appearance at the London marathon in April, is able to feel again after partly recovering from a foot injury that left her unable to run competitively for two years. These days she admits that she will not be able to keep up with the elite runners in London but hopes to run a time of between 2:30\u20132:40 depending on the condition of her foot. \u201cI\u2019m not going in there thinking I am going to be competitive because I am not,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be realistic. It\u2019s just an achievement to be able to get round. When I\u2019ve done longer runs my foot is sore the next day but during the run it is coping with two hours-plus now which is good.\u201d Meanwhile Radcliffe also wants to put something back into the sport by mentoring ordinary runners for the Great Manchester Run in May. \u201cRunning is something that has given me a lot over the years, and I want to give as much as possible back,\u201d she says. Paula Radcliffe is searching for six women to mentor for the Great Manchester Run so if you think you\u2019ve got what it takes to be one of \u2019Radcliffe\u2019s Great Runners\u2019 visit www.greatrun.org/Manchester"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
