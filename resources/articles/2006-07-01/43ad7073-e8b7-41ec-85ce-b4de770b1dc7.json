Defendants who cooperate with the authorities and plead guilty would receive lighter sentences, particularly if they implicated others involved in the fraud. The recommendation comes in a wide-ranging review of fraud, a crime estimated to cost the country \u00a316bn a year, from a cross-departmental group of senior officials. The review, open for consultation until the end of October, points to huge savings in the US from plea-bargaining, described as the \"dominant force in US courtroom procedure\". About 95% of cases are resolved through its use. Under proposals in the review, those facing fraud allegations would be able to agree a deal with prosecutors even before charges were brought. It says the Sentencing Guidelines Council should be asked to issue advice which would assist plea bargaining in fraud cases by making sentences more predictable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
