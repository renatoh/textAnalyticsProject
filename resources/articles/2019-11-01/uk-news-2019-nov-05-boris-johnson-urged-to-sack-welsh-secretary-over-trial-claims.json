Last week, the Welsh Conservatives claimed Cairns was unaware of Ross England\u2019s alleged role in the trial before it had become public only days earlier. But, on Tuesday, BBC Wales published an email it said was sent to Cairns by his special adviser more than a year earlier, in which the latter wrote: \u201cI have spoken to Ross and he is confident no action will be taken by the court.\u201d The Guardian has not been able to independently verify the report. The email was sent on 2 August 2018, the BBC reported. Four months later, England was selected as the Welsh Conservatives\u2019 candidate for the Vale of Glamorgan for the 2021 Welsh assembly election. He was later suspended after being accused by a judge of deliberately sabotaging the rape trial. After he made claims about the victim\u2019s sexual history while giving evidence, the judge, Stephen Hopkins, told England: \u201cYou have managed, singlehandedly, and I have no doubt it was deliberate on your part, to sabotage this trial. \u201cMr England, as far as I am concerned, this matter so far as you are concerned isn\u2019t ended. I shall be writing personal letters to people who are politically close to you and I hope they take appropriate action. Get out of my court.\u201d The defendant, James Hackett, was later convicted of rape at a retrial. On Tuesday, the shadow Welsh secretary, Christina Rees, said: \u201cThere are no two ways about this: Alun Cairns has been caught brazenly lying about how much he knew of Ross England\u2019s appalling behaviour at a rape trial. \u201cThe secretary of state, special advisers and senior Welsh Tory officials knew what had happened. They chose to select Ross England anyway \u2013 and to mislead and obfuscate when found out. The decision is an error of judgment \u2013 the cover-up is unforgivable. Alun Cairns should go, as secretary of state and as a candidate.\u201d Plaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, also called for Cairns to be removed as Welsh secretary and withdrawn as a general election candidate. In a letter to the prime minister, she said: \u201cThe revelation that Alun Cairns knew about Ross England\u2019s role in this case before endorsing him as a candidate shows that Mr Cairns is unfit to hold public office. \u201cAt worst, Mr Cairns is complicit in the attempted cover-up of his former staff member\u2019s actions which collapsed a rape trial. At best, he has displayed gross incompetence in judgment, dishonesty and a lack of leadership.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Welsh Conservatives said: \u201cThere is no new information from this leaked document confirming an informal conversation which took place a considerable time after the trial collapsed and is consistent with statements made. \u201cThe full details of this case are still not known and we have taken action in writing to the court. All forthcoming information will be taken into account as the party conducts a thorough investigation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
