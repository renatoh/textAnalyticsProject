Not outsource it to us", "bodyText": "\u201cDemocracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard,\u201d said the American journalist HL Mencken, who died 60 years before the EU referendum but nonetheless seems to have known how things might play out. The British people have spoken and said \u2026 what, exactly? Last week\u2019s BritainThinks survey of today\u2019s attitudes found rampant pessimism, anxiety and gloom. \u201cI cannot recall a time when the national mood was more despairing,\u201d said the research firm\u2019s boss Deborah Mattinson. Now we learn that the government is going to give this participatory democracy idea another go, launching a citizens\u2019 assembly on the climate emergency later in the year. The catch is that, while a group of informed and motivated people will meet several times this autumn, its recommendations will be merely advisory and not binding. A spokeswoman for Greenpeace worried that the assembly might simply be a \u201cglorified public consultation\u201d. We have lived through a succession of outsourcing scandals and disasters in recent times. Carillion, Interserve, G4S, Capita, Kier Group and Serco have all made headlines for the wrong reasons. But what we are experiencing today may the biggest scandal of the lot \u2013 the outsourcing of the destiny of the nation to a confused, disgruntled and disillusioned population. Asking citizens to settle the complicated matter of our continued membership of the EU with a simple yes/no question was not one of David Cameron\u2019s better ideas. It bought him an extra year in office after the 2015 election, but has left his political reputation in tatters. He outsourced the government\u2019s responsibility for governing to the rest of us. Most sensible people probably aren\u2019t all that interested in politics much of the time. In the past Jim Messina, the US elections strategist, has argued that the average person may spend only four minutes a week really engaging with political issues. That was then. Since the referendum it has been impossible to hide from endless, noisy talk about hard and soft Brexits, the customs union, the single market, Norway plus, super-Canada, and all the rest of the joyous vocabulary of despair. And normal people\u2019s reaction to all this? I refer you to the findings of the BritainThinks survey. We\u2019ve had enough of it. We\u2019ve been forced to try to engage with obscure technocratic chat and the result is the gloom, anxiety and confusion which has shocked seasoned researchers. I was out buying a copy of Private Eye recently \u2013 the one with a blank cover underneath the headline \u201cTheresa May memorial issue: the prime minister\u2019s legacy in full\u201d. The shop assistant saw it, laughed, and then corrected herself. \u201cWell, they [Private Eye] have a go at everyone, don\u2019t they?\u201d she said rather hastily. This was how we used to discuss politics (if we did at all): tentatively, and with some care. Not knowing my personal views the shop assistant had rowed back a bit from her initial response. For all she knew I could have been a Theresa May supporter. It wouldn\u2019t do to get into a row about it. This great Brexit outsourcing calamity has turned us all into semi-informed pundits, required to have a clear view on issues that are complicated, mysterious and unknowable. It\u2019s like being trapped at a three-year-long dinner party with guests you don\u2019t know or particularly like. We\u2019re all thoroughly fed up with it and want to go home. Except that our former home seems impossibly out of reach. When I read in this paper that \u201cgovernments are going to have to embrace such innovations as citizens\u2019 assemblies and participatory budgeting\u201d, a voice inside my head asks: really? A citizens\u2019 jury sounds like a fine thing. But when called for actual jury service how do a lot of people react? They look for any reason to postpone it or get out of it altogether. There is, sadly, a lot more unpleasantness to get through before the Brexit disaster will be in any sense behind us. Paradoxically, we may need one more democratic moment \u2013 an election or a further referendum \u2013 to move on. But then perhaps, one day, we could go back to having politicians who do not shirk the duty of leadership, and a political system that has the confidence to operate more normally, without outsourcing its work to the rest of us. Of course, we still want \u201cgovernment of the people, by the people, for the people\u201d. We just need to find some better people to do it. Don\u2019t hold your breath. \u2022 Stefan Stern is co-author of Myths of Management"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
