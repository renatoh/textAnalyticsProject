The decisions over May\u2019s transgressions \u2013 one in each half \u2013 appeared, to the letter of the law, the right ones but that did not stop the Leicester head coach, Matt O\u2019Connor, calling for the relevant legislation to be revised. \u201cI would dearly love for the law-makers to look at it because it is never a red card,\u201d said O\u2019Connor, whose side have lost five in a row and face a trip to Exeter on New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cIt is tough but that is the way they are refereeing it and the way it is going.\u201d This was a chaotic if entertaining match, punctuated by repeated handling errors, an absorbing scrum tussle between Dan Cole and Mako Vunipola \u2013 won emphatically by the former \u2013 and the contrasting styles of George Ford and Owen Farrell, a battle edged by the latter. Leicester were left to lament May\u2019s knock-ons \u2013 the second coming when they were nine points down with 13 minutes remaining and ending any hopes of victory \u2013 and too many mistakes with ball in hand, not to mention their horribly sluggish start, having fallen 17-0 behind after 26 minutes. \u201c[There are] no question marks about the result,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cYou can\u2019t give Sarries 17 points and expect to pull it back.\u201d If this was a clash of two of England\u2019s heavyweights, it was won by the team that could less afford to lose. Saracens are the two-times European champions and had lost seven on the spin \u2013 defeat here would have been their worst sequence in the professional era \u2013 but now they are up to second in the table. \u201cLike I kept saying, we didn\u2019t think there was that much wrong,\u201d the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, said. \u201cI thought it was a confident display. We didn\u2019t look like a team drained of confidence. I think we got what we deserved today.\u201d Saracens\u2019 early dominance was such that they were 10 points and a man up before they had even made a tackle. May was sent to the sin-bin by the referee, Matt Carley, for his first deliberate knock\u2011on with Sean Maitland denied in the right corner. Saracens ought to have stretched their lead but poor final passes form Alex Goode and Chris Wyles proved costly. May returned but Jamie George was next on the score sheet. Vunipola produced one of those pullback passes that are swiftly becoming a trademark, with Farrell the recipient. His quick hands freed George to thunder in under the posts. With Farrell also having added an earlier penalty, Saracens were 17-0 up and coasting. The Tigers stirred, however, and responded through Mathew Tait after Adam Thompstone\u2019s dextrous inside pass. Ford nailed the tricky conversion and the Welford Road faithful roused themselves. There had not been a Christmas Eve fixture here since 1927 and until that point they were doubtless hoping for a similar wait for the next. Ben Youngs\u2019s neat grubber on his own 22 had the crowd on their feet. It led to a breathless passage of play \u2013 Farrell attempting to ignite a counterattack on Saracens\u2019 left before Ford followed suit. If England\u2019s No9, 10 and 12 were sparkling, however, the man many wish to see back in the No13 jersey continues to show signs of rust. Manu Tuilagi\u2019s first touch was a knock-on \u2013 it was not his last of those \u2013 and he was also penalised for crossing in the opening half. He was blowing as hard as anyone when the half-time whistle went \u2013 a Ford penalty bringing Leicester to within seven before Farrell put Saracens back into a 10-point lead shortly after the restart, extending it soon after with a sweetly struck drop-goal. Cue four Leicester scrums with Cole making mincemeat of Vunipola before Carley eventually awarded the penalty try. The Tigers were back to within six but again proved the masters of their own downfall, swiftly conceding a penalty which Farrell dispatched. Then came May\u2019s second transgression, the harsher of the two considering how close he was to Michael Rhodes when the Saracens replacement made the pass. To twist the knife, Farrell was on target again with the resulting penalty, and although Vunipola was shown a yellow card late on Saracens had by that stage made sure the rot had been stopped.
