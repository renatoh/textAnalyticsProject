Health worker at a regional trauma centre, 63 A: Novelist Tim Lott, whose latest book, When We Were Rich (Scribner, \u00a316.99), will be published on 27 June, writes: You do not want anything that requires too much mental effort. So avoid grabbing, if you possibly can, the nearest Thomas Pynchon or Virginia Woolf. On the other hand, something overly dumb or badly written is also off the cards as it can be too aesthetically upsetting \u2013 no Jeffrey Archer or EL James (or The Little Book of Calm for that matter). Historical fiction is a great way to de-stress. I read Golden Hill by Francis Spufford last year and as intelligent a book I have rarely read. Or try JG Farrell\u2019s great The Siege of Krishnapur. A short thriller is also a lovely way to relax \u2013 try Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter by Tom Franklin for a masterclass in absorption. And, of course, How to Be Idle by Tom Hodgkinson if you\u2019re in the habit of working too hard. I find short stories unsatisfying, so I stick to essays by Tom Wolfe or John Steinbeck for a brief dip before I fall asleep. Wolfe\u2019s Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers is my favourite, an extended essay way ahead of its time. Steinbeck\u2019s best collection is Of Men and Their Making. You could try laughing yourself back to sanity. Anything by PG Wodehouse, of course \u2013 The Code of the Woosters is as good as any, and early William Boyds are witty without being trite. Anne Tyler\u2019s The Accidental Tourist is a great book about recovering from trauma (if you think you\u2019ve had a bad day, you\u2019ve nothing on Macon Leary). If you want a new worldview to help you think about stress in the long term, read some Zen texts \u2013 Alan Watts\u2019s The Meaning of Happiness \u2013 is a masterpiece of de-stressing in 120 pages, and Lin Yutang\u2019s The Importance of Living has the advantage of being funny as well as wise.
