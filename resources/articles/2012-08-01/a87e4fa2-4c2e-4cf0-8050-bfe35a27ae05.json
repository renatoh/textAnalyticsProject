The computers quickly went from too weak to too strong. But for a span of 10 years these contests were fascinating clashes between the computational power of the machines (and, lest we forget, the human wisdom of their programmers) and the intuition and knowledge of the grandmaster.\" Oscar Pistorius is used to questions. In fact, he likes to encourage people to ask them. \"When I am at home I sometimes go to the shopping centre to get groceries after training in the evening, still in my athletics pants,\" he says. \"And I will see a kid staring at my legs, and immediately the parent will turn the child away and say 'don't stare, don't stare.'\" He understands why people react that way. They have, he says, been doing it for decades. But it still annoys him. \"That child has no preconceptions, no appreciation of the idea of disability, and all of a sudden they are learning to think 'OK this is something we don't do, something we don't talk about.' It forms a negative association,\" Pistorius explains. \"So I go up to that parent and child and I say 'Hi, my name is Oscar, and these are my cool prosthetic legs.'\" Usually he tells them that his other ones \"got bitten off by a shark\", unless, he adds with a sly grin, \"the mother is beautiful, then I tell them it happened because I didn't eat my vegetables. Then I always get a good thumbs up from her.\" It is not the everyday questions Pistorius is tired of, but the hypothetical ones. His career poses plenty of those too: Is Pistorius the first of many Paralympians who will be able to run, jump, and throw to a level that makes them able to compete in the Olympics? Or is he a one-off? In 1985, Garry Kasparov was able to play 32 simultaneous matches against the world's best chess computers and win every one. Twelve years later he lost his match against IBM's supercomputer Deep Blue. \"Today,\" Kasparov has written, \"for $50 you can buy a home PC program that will crush most grandmasters.\" That transition took a little less than 20 years. At the Olympics, 400m gold medallist, Kirani James, finished 15 places ahead of Pistorius, in a time that was 1.06sec quicker than Pistorius' personal best. In 20 years' time, however, will the Olympic champion still be so far ahead of Pistorius' own successors? Will technology have narrowed the gap, or even made it disappear altogether? That, funnily enough, was exactly the same leap forward that Pistorius mentioned in his pre-Paralympic press conference. \"Now,\" he said, \"the new debate in Paralympics is about developments in prosthetics: 'Do you think that in 20 years\u2026?'\" Pistorius is not interested in that question. He has spent too much time fighting to be able to use his own Cheetah running blades to worry about a future that does not affect him. \"Ultimately that doesn't matter,\" he says. \"The prosthetic leg that we have is the one that is deemed to be fair. I am not and I am sure a lot of my competitors aren't looking to make the improvements through technology. They are happy with what we have.\" Pistorius shies away from that question because he does not want people to make the mistake of thinking it is the technology that made him capable of running as fast as he does. He has spent enough time, energy, and money fighting that battle already, in press conferences, laboratories, and courtrooms across South Africa, Europe, and the USA. He rightly argues that his speed comes from a combination of dedication, professionalism, and talent. \"Paralympic athletes have been able to run in state and national events I have just been hard working and talented enough to compete on an international level,\" he says. \"It's not that I've done it to open the doors, the doors have always been open.\" That is not quite true. In March 2007, he ran the 400m in a new personal best of 46.56sec. Had it been almost any other runner, no one would have noticed. Because it was Pistorius the performance sent ripples all around the athletics world. Two weeks later the sport's governing body, the IAAF, introduced a special amendment to rule 144-2(e), prohibiting the use of \"any technical device that incorporates springs, wheels or any other element that provides the user with an advantage over another athlete not using such a device.\" There were motivated by the fear that Pistorius could be setting a precedent. In November of that same year, the Cheetah blades Pistorius uses to run on were made illegal in able-bodied competition. It took him, and his lawyers, four months to overturn that decision. \"As far as my prosthetic leg goes, the model that I have used has been made since 1996,\" Pistorius says. \"That prosthetic leg has been tested. That is the one with which we went to the Court of Arbitration for Sports hearing with. So that prosthetic leg is allowed to be used by any amputee.\" In fact Pistorius is so committed to his principles that at these Games, his rivals are using more up-to-date technology. Pistorius still uses a standard model, but the manufacturer, Ossur, has started to tailor blades to the requirements of individual athletes and events, so there is one set designed for running the bend, another for the straight, and another again for the long jump. The International Paralympic Committee, who must decide what technology is and is not permissible for use, has to ratify such advances. They are guided by the principle that all technology must be universally available and, crucially, must ensure that \"human performance is the critical endeavour not the impact of technology and equipment\". That, though, can be a hard line to draw. In coming years the IPC's technical committee can expect to be very busy indeed. Advances in prosthetic limb technology have been accelerated by the research and development done to improve the lives of amputees returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. The US military's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has been running a Revolutionizing Prosthetics program since 2006. \"The vision for the programme was to restore as much natural limb function as possible,\" explains Colonel Geoffrey Ling, the programme manager. Under Ling's guidance, DARPA has developed technology which enables \"direct brain-control-of-prostheses experiments with spinal-cord-injured patients\". They have been developing powered limbs, which can be controlled by thought. Richard Hirons, a clinical specialist who works for Ossur, says that \"In the normal arena of rehabilitation for amputees, the concept of replacing lost muscles, of providing powered prosthetics, isn't outrageous, it is fair. It is replacing like with like.\" Pistorius, Hirons explains, is essentially just using a \"simple curved piece of carbon fibre\" to run on. In the near future, however, the IPC will have to start making rulings on the legality of more complex prosthetics, the offsprings of those being developed now in DARPA's laboratories. Hirons describes it as \"augmented sport\". Hirons admits that now \"we are knocking on the door now in terms of exploring that technology for regular use, but as a concept I always say there is nothing to stop your imagination turning it up to 11 and saying 'can we better than the able-bodied at sport?'\" The answer, as Kasparov will tell you, is surely yes. It is simply a question of how long it will take."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
