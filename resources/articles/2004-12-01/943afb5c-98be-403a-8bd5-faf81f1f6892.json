The chief executive of the GMC, Finlay Scott, said he believed that it was the GMC's recent package of reforms, introduced in July 2003, which may have saved it from possible abolition. Speaking to SocietyGuardian.co.uk this afternoon, Mr Scott said he was \"genuinely glad\" that Dame Janet had \"recognised\" the steps which the GMC had undertaken to make the organisation more transparent and accountable. He said: \"She also recognised our willingness to work really hard to put patients at the centre of everything that we do. She didn't need to consider our abolition because the council had demonstrated its willingness to reform.\" Mr Finlay, who has been the GMC's chief executive for 10 years and is a former Department for Education and Skills civil servant, welcomed Dame Janet's commitment to keep a medical majority on the council. He said: \"She is not recommending a lay majority. She makes it quite clear in her report that the council should be dominated by medical members.\" Mr Finlay did however accept that Dame Janet wants to see changes to the way doctors are chosen to sit on the council. Under the present system, doctors are elected to the council by other doctors. She recommended that in future doctor members, as well as lay members, should be appointed by an independent process. Mr Finlay accepted the report's criticisms of the GMC. The organisation was described by Dame Janet as being \"fundamentally flawed\", and was guilty of \"looking after their own\". He said: \"In our evidence to the inquiry we acknowledged serious shortcomings so I wasn't surprised at the criticism. What is more challenging for us is how we respond to the changes - not about the past - but our reform programme.\" The chief executive however reiterated that the criticisms applied to the past, and did not take into account its raft of recent reforms which include increasing the council lay membership to 40%. He said: \"What I would say, and what I think Dame Janet is saying, is that there have been major changes to our organisation, and she is saying that she wants to see the evidence from that which I think is entirely right.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
