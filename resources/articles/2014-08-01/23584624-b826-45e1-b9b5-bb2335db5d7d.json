The top literary game has kept going at the Edinburgh international book festival in this very intense first week. Here\u2019s a round-up of what has happened in the last two days. George RR Martin, part II The creator of the Game of Thrones saga was in excellent form in both his events at the festival. He joked, gave quotes about sex, talked about the saga and gave insights into his writing life, influences and dreams. We already brought you everything that happened on his first talk \u2013 here is a recap plus all that\u2019s new: Listen to the books podcast about the author, with the best of his talks and interviews with his fans His second event: \u2018I can only write one word at a time, one book at a time\u2019 Catch up on the first event: GRRM reveals why there\u2019s no gay sex in Game of Thrones GRRM in quotes: \u2018I love writing about bastards\u2019 We went to the beautiful Letters Home Letters Home is a promenade performance of four epistolary stories commissioned by the festival, written by authors incuding Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Kamila Shamsie and performed in a series of rooms around Charlotte Square. Anxiety about new technologies and nostalgia for old ones have propelled letter writing to the centre of the literary stage, writes Claire Armitstead. Read the full review here. Do you hear voices? You are not alone We are continuing our special series about the experience of hearing voices and having conversations with one. Today our colleagues at Guardian Science have published this fascinating piece about the scientific side of auditory verbal hallucinations. Do share how you experience the characters in your head when you read in our open thread. Children\u2019s illustrators doodled beautifully for us We continued to ask children\u2019s books illustrators to make quick doodle for us \u2013 and kept capturing their every move. Here is Nick Sharratt (artist extraordinaire behind the Jacqueline Wilson books) drawing a hippo: And here is David Melling, who doodled a beautiful Hugless Douglass: Margaret Drabble spoke about her new novel The 75-year-old writer talked The Pure Gold Baby, her 18th novel. It took her five years of secret work, and it was a difficult book to write, she said, because it was based on a family she knew. Read Mark Brown\u2019s story here. Jackie Kay was... Jackie Kay It\u2019s no news that Jackie Kay has a magnetism, a charm and a soul that would drive the coldest person to tears \u2013 or laughter. Yesterday was no exception. The Scottish poet read beautifully a selection of poems and short stories \u2013 including the moving and uplifting Rose and Grace, about a lesbian wedding \u2013, managed to get two sing-alongs from the audience and moved just about everyone. Will Self talked about life and mental health What to say about Will Self that wasn\u2019t answered by himself on the webchat we hosted this week on the Guardian site? It turns out that the Booker-longlisted author\u2019s wit and capacity to surprise never end. One of the snippets from his event, where he delighted the audience with his characteristic snarky humour and talked about his new novel Shark with Stuart Kelly, is the following (successful) chat-up line he shared: \u201cI\u2019m jealous of your thoughts because they\u2019re inside you.\u201d In all seriousness, Self confessed that he is jealous of anyone\u2019s thoughts, because getting inside a human\u2019s mind would be fascinating. Self talked extensively about his family, the future of the novel and why he writes about mentally ill people: \u201cThey are a great challenge to our capacities for compassion. There\u2019s a duty of compassion.\u201d Richard Dawkins and his childhood fantasies Arguably the world\u2019s most famous biologist \u2013 definitely the most polemical \u2013, Richard Dawkins made an appearance this Wednesday, and talked about his childhood, literary career and, of course, his atheist arguments. Among the quotes he delivered was \u201cI don\u2019t mind disliked by complete idiots\u201d \u2013 referring to creationists \u2013 and he explained that at 13 he was \u201cbriefly seduced\u201d by religion, prayed every night and had the fantasy that if he went down to the altar in the middle of the night, and angel would show up. Read Mark Brown\u2019s story here. Two rising stars of international fiction from India and Iran Kader Abdolah was born in Tehran but emigrated to the Netherlands in 1988 where he has become a star of the Dutch fiction scene. In our books podcast, he explains how he used the storytelling traditions of ancient Persia to reclaim the 19th-century history of Iran from the European chroniclers of the time. Indian poet and activist Meena Kandasamy, meanwhile, presents a debut novel that investigates the limits of fiction in an account of a 1968 massacre in Tamil Nadu.
