He's tired. He has to get up early to face a grilling on the Today programme. And worst of all, he has to watch his package being picked apart by the policy wonks at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. By IFS standards, the pummelling given to George Osborne on Thursday was restrained. The thinktank was less critical about the shakeup to pensions and savings than some of the chancellor's critics in the financial services industry, who believe he is undoing all the good he has done by auto-enrolment. There were even things they liked, such as the changes to Isas and the scrapping of the 10% tax rate on savings. Even so, an IFS post-budget analysis would not be complete without a few tart words. Its main gripe yesterday was that the chancellor is getting into some bad habits, and that with polling day little more than a year away, this was more of a pre-election giveaway package than it looked at first sight. The IFS evidence for this was two-fold. First, it has problems with the way Osborne has made his sums add up. The tax cuts \u2013 worth almost \u00a35bn by 2018-19 \u2013 are set in stone; the tax increases and the spending cuts that are supposed to pay for them are, in some cases, more nebulous. A mini black hole could be opening up in the public finances, although the IFS could not say how big it might be. Take the decision, said the IFS's Gemma Tetlow, to allow workers approaching retirement to pay higher national insurance contributions to get a higher state pension. Over the next two years this will boost Treasury coffers but will eventually be matched by a longer-run flow of pension payments. Then there were the business measures. Here, the IFS noted that the annual investment allowance \u2013 due to be reduced from \u00a3250,000 to \u00a325,000 at the end of this year \u2013 had been doubled to \u00a3500,000 and extended until the end of 2015. The motivation doesn't take much explaining. After years of disappointing numbers, capital spending at last seems to have turned the corner and the chancellor wants to pull more investment forward over the next 12 months. The IFS also thought it a bit rum that a measure brought in only last year to boost investment in low-carbon energy \u2013 the carbon price support rate \u2013 had been watered down a year later. Seen in the light of the government's desire to encourage investment in renewables or nuclear, this sends out all the wrong messages. But the move will cut manufacturing costs in the short-term and makes sense if you are trying to secure better balanced growth before May 2015. Unsurprisingly, all this is not the way the Treasury sees it. Osborne's people say the budget accepted the need for further spending cuts and that, given his track record, nobody should doubt his determination to deliver. There was no question of the chancellor seeking to pull a fast one. In terms of its impact on spending, the IFS analysis suggests the budget will have only a modest impact. Everybody gains a little, with those in the middle of the income distribution gaining the most, but the giveaways are not enough to compensate for the losses that have been suffered since the start of 2010. Osborne is now seeking to make up for lost time. After the economic torpor of 2011 and 2012, he needs the economy to be firing on all cylinders in 2014 and early 2015. Modest tax cuts are designed to make consumer spending less dependent on a run down in savings; more generous investment allowances and help to exporters are there to ensure that the other engines of growth kick in. The message from the IFS is that life will get a lot grimmer after polling day. North Sea oil revenues are in long-term decline; the short-term fillip to investment will be removed; and \u2013 most significantly \u2013 there will be a second wave of cuts so big that no amount of smoke and mirrors will be able to disguise them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
