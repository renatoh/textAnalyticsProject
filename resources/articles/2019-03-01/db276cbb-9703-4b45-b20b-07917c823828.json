The special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential campaign, possible collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and the Russian government and whether Trump has attempted to obstruct the inquiry. Trump has denied wrongdoing and called the investigation a witch-hunt. Mueller is expected to send a report soon to the US attorney general, William Barr, outlining his findings, and any evidence of wrongdoing could prompt Congress to take action against the president. Several panels in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives are also investigating the president. Although Pelosi said she believed it would be too divisive to impeach Trump, she characterized the president as unfit to hold office. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s fit to be president of the United States,\u201d Pelosi told the Post, adding he was \u201cethically unfit, intellectually unfit, curiosity-wise unfit\u201d. Democrats face growing pressure from the left for impeachment, including a multimillion-dollar ad campaign from the liberal billionaire Tom Steyer to build support for action against Trump. Reacting to her comments, Steyer suggested Pelosi\u2019s stance was \u201cpolitically convenient\u201d. The House judiciary committee, which would lead an impeachment inquiry, recently launched a broad investigation of corruption, abuse of power and obstruction of justice allegations against Trump that could amount to impeachable offenses. The House judiciary committee chairman, Jerrold Nadler, has said he believes Trump has committed obstruction of justice, but that it is too soon to decide on impeachment. \u201cWe do not now have the evidence all sorted out,\u201d Nadler told ABC\u2019s This Week program on 3 March. He added: \u201cBefore you impeach somebody, you have to persuade the American public that it ought to happen.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
