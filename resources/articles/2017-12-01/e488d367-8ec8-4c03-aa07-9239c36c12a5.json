Damian Collins, chair of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport select committee, which is looking into so-called \u201cfake news\u201d, has given the companies until 18 January to correct their failure to hand over information he requested about Russian misinformation campaigns on their platforms. \u201cThere has to be a way of scrutinising the procedures that companies like Facebook put in place to help them identify known sources of disinformation, particularly when it\u2019s politically motivated and coming from another country,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThey need to be able to tell us what they can do about it. And what we need to be able to do is say to the companies: we recognise that you are best placed to monitor what is going on your own site and to get the balance right in taking action against it but also safeguarding the privacy of users. \u201cBut what there has to be then is some mechanism of saying: if you fail to do that, if you ignore requests to act, if you fail to police the site effectively and deal with highly problematic content, then there has to be some sort of sanction against you.\u201d Collins\u2019s intervention, the first concrete warning that sanctions could follow any failure to provide the information required, is likely to cause concern for the social media firms. Previously he had signalled his dissatisfaction in letters to the two companies without specifying the consequences of noncompliance. In a letter to Twitter this month, he wrote: \u201cThe information you have now shared with us is completely inadequate \u2026 It seems odd that so far we have received more information about activities that have taken place on your platform from journalists and academics than from you.\u201d Collins said his inquiry was looking at the question of what form sanctions could take. \u201cIn other countries they\u2019ve taken different positions. Germany has obviously gone furthest down this road.\u201d In mid-December, the German competition authority issued the country\u2019s latest rebuke of Facebook, accusing the company of violating European data protection principles by merging information gathered through WhatsApp and Instagram with Facebook user accounts. Collins suggested that one outcome of the inquiry could be social networks being hit where it hurts most: their revenue. \u201cOn the advertising side, what\u2019s important is, well, the extent of fake accounts. If you\u2019re selling advertising against those numbers, that cannot be ethical, and clearly that is something the advertising industry should be interested in.\u201d Collins would not have direct powers to punish Twitter and Facebook if they fail to cooperate more fully, but could ensure bad publicity for both if he continues to summon their representatives to face his committee. Meanwhile, ministers are understood to be concerned by the companies\u2019 attitude and could be sympathetic to any request for action. Collins\u2019s committee has asked Facebook and Twitter for a broad swath of information about Russian interference in the EU referendum, including details of the accounts and pages operated by Russian misinformation actors. Instead, in early December the two companies handed over a carbon copy of the information they had provided the Electoral Commission in response to a much narrower query about advertising spend from Russia during the six weeks leading up to the vote. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t expect was they would essentially completely ignore our request,\u201d Collins said, describing the companies\u2019 response as \u201cextraordinary\u201d. \u201cThey don\u2019t believe that they have any obligation at all to initiate their own investigation into what may or may not have been happening on the site \u2013 to look at the accounts that have been identified by the American authorities and say: OK, are there other accounts that share similar characteristics that could have come from the same source? They\u2019ve not done any of that work at all.\u201d In the information the companies handed over to the Electoral Commission, they identified small ad spends from previously known Russian actors. Facebook said just $0.97 had been spent on Brexit-related adverts by Russians that were seen by Brits, while Twitter claimed that the only Russian spending it was aware of during the period in question was $1,000 from the broadcaster RT. The Russian embassy in Britain seized on the initial figures released by Facebook to criticise media focus on misinformation operations. \u201cIt\u2019s [the Times columnist Hugo Rifkind] who holds British democracy in contempt by suggesting 52% voters can be bought for \u00a30.73,\u201d the embassy tweeted shortly after the exchange of letters between Facebook, Twitter and Collins. A few days later, the embassy shared a statement from the Russian foreign affairs ministry: \u201cUS &amp; UK financial elites controlling mainstream media are unleashing a campaign to put Facebook, Google, Twitter under strict control alleging they are used by extremists. Russia was targeted by social media fakes many times but it never curbed freedom of speech in internet.\u201d (In fact, Russian authorities have banned thousands of sites since Vladimir Putin\u2019s re-election in 2012, some for promoting \u201csocial ills\u201d, others for political dissent.) In the US, Facebook and Twitter carried out wide-ranging investigations that identified significant interference beyond simple ad spending. Facebook identified 470 accounts and pages run by the Russian Internet Research Agency, a St Petersburg-based \u201ctroll army\u201d, while Twitter provided Congress with a list of 2,752 accounts that it believed were linked to the organisation. \u201cI hope they realise that people\u2019s concerns about this issue aren\u2019t going away,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThey have an opportunity to be seen to be proactive. This is taking place in the context of the broader debate of their responsibilities.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
