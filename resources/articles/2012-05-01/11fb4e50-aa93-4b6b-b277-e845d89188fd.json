On its way from Worcester to Cardiff it will be taken across the rolling countryside of Monmouthshire before its journey into the old industrial highland around Brynmawr and Blaenavon. The turning point of the torch relay, from the gently bucolic to the industrially bruised, is the market town of Abergavenny and, above it, the 561-metre (1,841ft) Blorenge mountain. The contrast in the five miles that separate Abergavenny, picture-postcard pretty and home of the largest food festival in the UK, and Blaenavon, 91 metres down in a bowl on the other side of the Blorenge's summit, could not be starker. Blaenavon was a cradle of industrial revolution, once rich in the ore, coal and limestone that made it an iron town of 20,000 inhabitants. It is now less than a third of that size, but is a world heritage site and home of the Big Pit national coal museum. High on the moorland between the two towns is an outcrop of grey rocks, and set in the middle there is a green metal plaque marking the burial site of Foxhunter, the horse ridden by Sir Harry Llewellyn at the Helsinki Olympic Games of 1952. On 2 August that year, the day before the end of a Games during which Britain had not won a single gold medal, the pair went clear in the second round of the team showjumping, and the country had a winner at last. Wilf White, on Nizefela, and Duggie Stewart, on Aherlow, obviously played their part, but it was Foxhunter and Llewellyn who seemed to capture the public's imagination. Here was a tale of recovery, of converting 16.75 first-round faults into a clear in the second. Llewellyn had had success as an amateur jockey before the war, finishing second on Ego in the 1936 Grand National. But after the war \u2013 he ended it as liaison officer to Montgomery \u2013 he concentrated on showjumping. He bought Foxhunter as a six-year-old in 1946, and they won a team bronze at the London Games of 1948, and then the gold in Helsinki. Foxhunter's burial site between Blaenavon and Abergavenny is carefully placed. Llewellyn was born into a coal family, on the owners' side. His father, the chairman of Welsh Associated Collieries, took the baronetcy of Bwllfa, Aberdare in 1922. Llewellyn had the money to live elsewhere, down off the mountain in a beautiful home, Llanfair Grange, near Abergavenny. After nationalisation of the coal industry in 1947, he turned to other businesses, with interests in brewing and television. After 1952 he set up a chain of cafes called Foxhunter. The horse retired in 1955 and died in 1959. Llewellyn died in 1999 and his ashes were scattered around the horse's memorial. That is, between a coal town and the edge of the cliff that will look down on the Olympic torch, 60 years after Llewellyn and Foxhunter helped win Britain's one and only Olympic gold medal in the 1952 Games.
