We came upon several treasures in the undergrowth, but few things were quite as unbothered as a stand of peony that marked the site of a long-forgotten border. They seemed oblivious to shade from advancing saplings, the swell of bramble and 6ft nettles, and they dealt with the insidious creep of ground elder as if it was nothing. They were the old-timers, there to mark the incarnation of a previous garden, and they were staying put. The Paeonia officinalis \"Rubra Plena\" are nothing special as far as peonies go, but the beetroot spring growth and exotic frill of petals inspired a love of the group that has endured and continues to do so. My \"Molly the Witch\" are already over in the garden here, but for the week that they were out in May I was out there every morning to make the most of their fleeting presence. This is one of the first to flower, but the blooms are only the culmination of a fascinating awakening. The show is over before the longest day of the year, but it starts in March, with scarlet-tipped shoots which break to reveal smoky-purple foliage. The dark infusion fades to green as the buds swell and start to show yellow. Seedlings will take four years to flower, but you won't have to do any more than mulch and defend your clumps from inadvertent footfall when they are dormant and you are working the beds. They don't mind a little summer shade and will be happy to drop into the shadows for the second half of the summer. I have several peonies here that I like as much for their early foliage as I do their flower. Beth Chatto gave me \"Late Windflower\" and it has taken to the dappled shade under the Hydrangea aspera. The early foliage emerges like an insect, shining and meaty red-brown, but by the time the elegantly poised flowers are with us late in May it has greened up and handed the mantle over to the flowers. They are cherubic in bud, pointed like a lip kissing, but open flat to reveal a boss of yellow stamens. The flowers are a soapy white and unbelievably elegant, and several buds will relay to keep you in flower for more than a fortnight \u2013 Kelways of Langport supplies (01458 250 521). The shrubby P delavayi is also wonderful in leaf. It is a variable species, and I have three here that I raised from seed. The darkest has flowers the colour of dried blood, and the palest is apricot. P delavayi var \"Ludlowii\" is the largest-growing of them all, with golden king cups and pale green leaves that are architectural for the duration of the summer. Several peonies also produce fine autumn foliage, and I have woven a drift of the herbaceous \"White Wings\" into one garden for this purpose. The single flowers are aptly named and emerge with white foxgloves in the dappled shade of a nuttery, but the foliage colours crimson and tomato red and is as wonderful at the other end of the season. This year I am seeking out some of the best herbaceous peonies to get to know them better, to extend a cutting garden for a client. They will be flamboyant varieties, luxuriant and as delicate as tissue paper, and many will be scented. The Chinese and the Japanese revered the peony in whole gardens dedicated to their cultivation, and for a month we will be able to savour their blooms up close in a jar. It will take three years before they are strong enough to pick, and there will be a range of forms and colours so that you can change the mood according to what is cut. I will have \"Bowl of Beauty\", sugary and almost single but with an inner crest of petals like an exotic bird, and scented \"Duchess de Nemours\" to name just two, but there will be more in deep, bloody red and coral and cream. It will be nice to think that in 50 years' time they will hopefully still be going strong and inspiring another generation of gardeners.
