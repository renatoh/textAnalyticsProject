Musicals were born out of the working-class traditions of music hall and vaudeville. Opera was borne out the patronage of the noble and the moneyed. The concerns of each are directly influenced by those origins. Tom Service: All art forms, including opera, are for everyone According to your argument, plays, paintings, sculpture, architecture and other art forms with their antecedents in courtly patronage would bear the scars of exclusivity and toffitude. The best counterargument is simple: go to the opera in Glasgow or Cardiff, Leeds or London and talk to the audience. The toff-count, I promise, will be tiny. 2 JR: Opera's plots are a bore Being music that arises out of ancient courtly traditions, the standard opera plot draws upon classical Greek or Judaeo-Christian legends and myths. Which is just so yesterday. Oh sure, every now and then someone attempts to come up with something more relevant to contemporary life but it's a break with the mainstream. Musical storylines may be accused of sentimentality or melodrama \u2013 boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy and girl tap-dance into the sunset \u2013 but at least they have a relevance to their audience's lives. TS: In their day, opera's storylines were nothing short of incendiary Sure, myth was the dominant subject in the courtly operas of the 17th and 18th centuries. I rather like a good myth: Monteverdi and Gluck made living, breathing, sensual humanity from \"yesterday's\" stories. But then Mozart came along. He did something radical when he wrote The Marriage of Figaro in 1786, turning Beaumarchais's incendiary piece of pre-revolutionary upstairs-downstairs theatre into what's possibly the world's best-loved opera. That was just the start: Rossini's comedies, Verdi's prostitutes, Puccini's jilted lovers and murderers; they're basically all boy meets girl, girl dies of consumption/goes into the sunset (if she's lucky). Opera just got there before musical theatre, that's all. 3 JR: Opera is where lyrics go to die Nobody goes to opera for linguistic gymnastics. The old saw about singers repeating the same clumsy lines back and forth at each other is horribly true. The librettos are written with all the subtlety and wit of a naff greetings card. That's if you can understand what's being said, because most of the time they aren't in English. And don't tell me there are surtitles. If I wanted to read, I'd stay home with a book. Musical lyrics, on the other hand \u2013 I'm thinking Alan Jay Lerner, Stephen Sondheim or Cole Porter \u2013 are a true literary marvel. TS: The problem here is language There are some sublime couplets and rhymings in Lorenzo Da Ponte's librettos for Mozart, and there's some brilliant Teutonic wordplay in Wagner's music-dramas. It's just that nothing \u2013 even the best translation - can really live up to the originals: \"Non pi\u00f9 andrai, farfallone amaroso\" (\"You won't go any more, amorous butterfly\") sounds much better in Italian. So yes, to really appreciate all that, you're going to have to engage with the original. So why not use it as an excuse to learn a new language? 4 JR: It's a bloody racket Operatic singing may require vast reserves of technique and skill, but that doesn't make it a pleasure to listen to. The endless screech of even the best soprano in full throttle is like being caught downwind of a jet engine into which someone has maliciously thrown a spanner. TS: Opera is a glorious sound A mediocre opera singer may approach your description, but that's nothing compared to the vibrato-laden mediocrity of the pseudo-singers who prop up much of the West End and nearly every TV talent show. 5 JR: Opera singers can't act Oh sure, there are one or two who can give something approaching a performance, but for the most part you're watching a serious pair of lungs in too much taffeta, giving it wellie. But that doesn't matter because in opera the drama is an irrelevance. Everything serves the music. Musical theatre, by contrast, is a perfect amalgam of text, music and drama. TS: Opera's drama is unparalleled I can think of dozens of performances that are seared in my mind as the best dramatic experiences I've had in any theatre. John Tomlinson is responsible for quite a few of them, as the Minotaur in Birtwistle's opera and Gurnemanz in Wagner's Parsifal. And the reason singers such as Tomlinson are so great is because of what they do with the drama. You can't have one without the other. Composers were only ever inspired to write music because of the drama \u2013 because they wanted to tell a story through music. Which is the same as what George Gershwin, Stephen Sondheim, Leonard Bernstein, and even Andrew Lloyd Webber have always done. \"A perfect amalgam of text, music and drama\". Couldn't have put it better myself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
