Central to the package are proposals to ensure quality and fair play by injecting an additional \u00a3700m into the sector above existing government spending plans. The party wants to encourage universities to use the extra cash to improve pay and conditions and end the \"disgraceful gap\" between the pay of female and male academics. The party plans to end top-up fees and introduce a means-tested support grant along the lines of the system in Scotland, increase the threshold at which student loans are repaid and give greater financial incentives to recruit and retain students from under-represented groups. While the government has claimed that the introduction of tuition fees has not deterred students from applying to British universities, the Liberal Democrats claim their research shows this is not the case. Their leader, Charles Kennedy, said: \"Liberal Democrats are committed to scrapping tuition fees.\" The party's higher education spokesman, Evan Harris, added: \"Our carefully costed commitments will allow us to restore the principle of higher education free at the point of access, open up our universities to students from poorer backgrounds, remove some of the burden of student debt, abolish the disgraceful pay gap which exists for female academics and tackle the recruitment and retention crisis affecting lecturers and researchers.\" Last week the education and employment secretary, David Blunkett, issued an unexpected Commons statement ruling out the introduction of American-style top up fees which allow some universities to charge students as much as \u00a37,000 a year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
