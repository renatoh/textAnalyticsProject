Characterising the Polish film director as a \"twerp\", Edward Perlberg, 66, said his girlfriend, Beatte Telle, then a model with the Ford agency, had been so \"flustered\" by the director's advances that she immediately insisted they leave the restaurant. \"She arose and looked at me and said, 'Ed, we're leaving',\" Mr Perlberg told the jury. \"This was very unusual.\" Mr Perlberg was giving evidence on the third day of Polanski's libel suit against Cond\u00e9 Nast, the publishers of Vanity Fair over its allegation that in August 1969, shortly after his wife Sharon Tate's brutal murder by the Charles Manson famil cult, he had stopped off at Elaine's restaurant in New York and used his deceased wife's name as a \"tool of seduction\". Mr Perlberg said he had gone to Elaine's to dine with his friend, Lewis Lapham, then a rising New York journalist, when there was suddenly \"a kind of a strange quiet\". He said: \"I looked back and I saw Roman Polanski. I knew it was Roman Polanski because his picture had been in the newspapers due to the unfortunate happenings in the few weeks before that. Also I was a kind of film buff.\" He introduced himself to Polanski, who was standing next to Miss Telle, and the two men shook hands. The court heard that a little later, Polanski, without waiting to be invited, pulled up a chair from an adjacent table and inserted himself between Mr Perlberg and his girlfriend. Mr Perlberg told the jury that Polanski \"seemed most interested in Miss Telle\" and had \"kind of monopolised her attentions. \"And, as I was viewing this, I began to see that she was somewhat flustered,\" he added. He had not heard what Polanski had said to Ms Telle, but on the way home in a cab he asked her what was wrong and she explained how Polanski had touched her with his hand, and had added, \"I should come to Hollywood and he would give me a screen test and make another Sharon Tate of me.\" Mr Perlberg continued: \"I thought this was generally creepy and it bothered me. I said, 'You know, that's strange, but perhaps he could be excused because he just suffered such a massive shock', but that didn't seem to lessen her anxiety. We wound up agreeing that he had behaved improperly, and I think words that he was a twerp or to that effect were used.\" Earlier, Mr Lapham, the 70-year-old editor of New York's Harper's magazine, told the jury that he stood by the words attributed to him by AE Hochner, author of the Vanity Fair article, namely that Polanski told Ms Telle: \"I will make another Sharon Tate out of you.\" \"I was impressed by the remark, not only because it was tasteless and vulgar, but because it was a clich\u00e9,\" he said. Polanski, now 71 and living in France, from where he gave evidence by videolink yesterday, argues that Vanity Fair's article implies that he went \"on the pull\" after Tate's death, which, if true, would amount to a \"callous indifference\" to his wife's memory. Vanity Fair concedes that the conversation did not take place before Tate's funeral in California, as its article originally alleged, but on Polanski's return journey to London via New York. However, when asked whether he would apologise for this error, Mr Lapham insisted that the article as it stood was substantially true, saying: \"Well, certainly I would apologise for that. Would Mr Polanski apologise to me for calling me an abominable liar?\" The hearing continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
