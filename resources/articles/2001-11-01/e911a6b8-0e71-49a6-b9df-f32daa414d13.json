The bombardments hit a fuel and ammunitions dump north of the capital of Kabul, a garrison in northern Takhar province and reportedly a hydroelectric plant in southern Afghanistan. Today's raids came a day after the Pentagon admitted using B-52 aircraft to carpet bomb troop positions, and as Turkey announced it would send a 90-strong special forces unit to train the troops of Afghanistan's northern-based opposition alliance. Opposition fighters have been complaining for weeks that the American assaults are insufficient. Despite the fire power, there were no changes today in the front lines between the northern alliance and the Taliban, who are accused of harbouring the terrorists responsible for the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon. Taliban officials said their forces repulsed a three-pronged opposition assault yesterday after air attacks against Taliban positions defending another northern city, Mazar-i-Sharif. Northern alliance officials say they are gearing up for a major assault on Mazar-i-Sharif. Capturing that city would enable the alliance to cut Taliban supply lines to western Afghanistan and open routes to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the north. Abdullah Abdullah, the foreign minister of the opposition's government-in-exile, said the opposition will soon be able to begin breaking the Taliban's front lines around Afghanistan if the US maintains intense bombardments. He told reporters in the opposition-held town of Jabal Saraj that his troops would reach their \"highest level of preparation\" and were ready to break the Taliban front lines around Afghanistan \"within a few days\". Despite such optimism - and the reinforcement of alliance troops and weaponry near the front lines - the opposition still appears outmanned and outgunned in much of the country. The Taliban said the opposition's attack in the Dar-i-Suf district south-east of Mazar-i-Sharif failed despite American bombing. Taliban diplomats in Islamabad, Pakistan, said opposition fighters left bodies of their dead on the battlefield. The claim could not be independently confirmed. US attacks today around the Kala Kata garrison in northern Takhar province followed a day of intensified bombing near Bagram, 50km (30 miles) north of Kabul, where the B-52s joined the battle to dislodge the Taliban from positions blocking the way to the Afghan capital. Overnight, US jets struck a Taliban fuel and ammunition dump near the opposition-controlled Bagram air base on the Kabul front, according to opposition spokesman Waisuddin Salik. Three fuel tanks and two trucks were destroyed, he said. For the past 11 days, US air attacks have shifted away from high-profile urban targets in favour of Taliban front line positions north of Kabul and near the northern cities of Mazar-i-Sharif and Taloqan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
