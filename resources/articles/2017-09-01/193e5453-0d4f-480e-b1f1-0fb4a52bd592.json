I was in the studio when the winds started increasing around 1am, but it really started picking up drastically about 2am. By 4am the winds were so strong that the shutters were completely blown away. The men who were in the studio (a producer and a presenter) had to hold up a board in front of the window so that the pressure in the room would not get to the point where the window would explode. All the while we had to keep on announcing on air and taking 911 calls. One woman who phoned in said the pole outside her house was sparking and she was afraid that it would catch fire. One man said he had a baby in the room with him and he was not sure what to do. He was helpless, saying: \u201cHelp me, help me.\u201d I told him to get into the bathroom \u2013 that was the advice we were given. The pressure in the studio was similar to that in an airplane. You had to keep unlocking your jaw; you kept opening your mouth to release the pressure. The walls were vibrating. We had to put a garbage bag over the door to protect it. Then the system went down and we went off air and that\u2019s when I decided to share what was happening on Twitter. I got a voice message from my mother saying the hospital where she worked was flooding and the roof was being blown away and her voice was shaking so much. I called her and couldn\u2019t get a response. I was pacing the hallway trying to catch myself because I was so overwhelmed about what could have happened to my family, about the helplessness I was feeling when people were calling in with their emergencies and the tears they were crying. At one point I let out a yelp as there was a loud crash outside and I thought it was a projectile coming through the window. I was standing in front of an exposed window and, while there was someone with a board in front of the window, it was feeble. If something had decided to fly at that window there\u2019s no way we would have lived. You could see trees being flung from one point to another. My co-worker\u2019s car was moving across the parking lot to the grass, windows were smashed, things were flying. When I came out of the station there were no leaves on any trees. You could not recognise your own island. Everything was destroyed, everything was flattened. Galvanised roofs were blown out. There\u2019s an ABC supply store close by, a huge store, and the roof was torn off and everything was piled on top of everything else. It\u2019s a mess. When I walked around I started to cry because the hurricane has taken it all away. We\u2019ve just celebrated our 50-year anniversary and I feel like now we have to say: \u201cOK, we start again, we have to rebuild all of that.\u201d Right now it\u2019s just about survival. We do not have electricity and there is no running water. We have water and food, but we\u2019re not sure how long we will have enough. Listening to the chief minister on Radio Anguilla, he was saying the focus is not on the infrastructure, it\u2019s on the people who are homeless. People are stealing. There is looting going on, a lot of bad people are taking advantage of the weaknesses of others, but that does not represent the Anguillan mentality. The majority of people are mostly trying to come together to help each other out. So many people who have lost their homes now have to rely on a friend or relative just to find a place to sleep. A lot of people are willing to open their doors right now. People are in a panic here. Hurricane Jos\u00e9 is coming. Here, it has been officially downgraded to a tropical storm but it\u2019s still a category 4 and we\u2019re expecting it around 1pm today [yesterday]. We are afraid of the impact because we are starting from a point of weakness. We will mourn with our island, it\u2019s such a beautiful place and it gives us so much back. There are some people who are considering relocating, a lot of people who say they never want to experience this again and want to live in a part of the world that is not impacted by hurricanes. But that is what life is like here. Some people have to live with tornadoes. We live with hurricanes.
