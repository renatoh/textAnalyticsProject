The move was condemned by the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), which said it demonstrated an \u201cunwillingness to deal with bigotry seriously\u201d, while Labour said Johnson had \u201cbroken his promise in less than two weeks\u201d. In an interview with the ConservativeHome website, the Tory leadership frontrunner said he had agreed with Sajid Javid, the home secretary, who pushed for the Islamophobia inquiry, that it should instead have a broader focus. The idea was raised by Javid during a BBC leadership debate involving the candidates still in the race at the time \u2013 the others being Johnson, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove and Rory Stewart. Asked if he believed such an inquiry should be held, Javid said: \u201cYes I would \u2013 do you all agree, guys? Shall we have an external investigation in the Conservative party into Islamophobia?\u201d The other candidates all seemingly agreed, with none raising any objections. But in the ConservativeHome interview, when asked about the plan, Johnson said: \u201cWell, I took it up with Saj afterwards and he said that actually, if I understand it correctly, what we\u2019ve committed to is a general investigation into all types of prejudice and discrimination, including antisemitism.\u201d Asked if this would be an independent investigation, Johnson replied: \u201cYup.\u201d He added: \u201cSo yes, we\u2019ll have to study exactly what Saj has in mind, but it sounded like a sensible idea when he mentioned it.\u201d There was no response from representatives of Javid when asked to confirm that he had agreed to this plan. The apparent downgrading of the inquiry will disappoint anti-Islamophobia campaigners, who have repeatedly called for the Conservatives to tackle the issue. A poll of Tory members earlier this week found nearly half would prefer not to have a Muslim prime minister. The survey, carried out by YouGov for the anti-racism group Hope Not Hate, also found more than two-thirds of Tory members believe the myth that parts of the UK are under sharia law, and 45% think some areas are not safe for non-Muslims. Half the party\u2019s members think Islamophobia is a big issue, but only 8% believe it is a problem within the party, the survey found, while 40% of members wanted to see fewer Muslims in the UK. An MCB spokesman said: \u201cWe are disappointed to see that Mr Johnson has apparently reneged on his promise for an independent inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party. \u201cIt has become all too apparent that the Conservatives have a problem with Islamophobia, as evidenced this week with a damning poll revealing how rank-and-file Conservative party members hold conspiratorial views on Muslims. \u201cRowing back on the promise only demonstrates further unwillingness to deal with bigotry seriously. We expect nothing less than a full and independent inquiry into Islamophobia.\u201d Naz Shah, the shadow equalities minister, said: \u201cBoris Johnson has broken his promise in less than two weeks. Anything short of a full, independent inquiry into Islamophobia and racism in the Conservative party will be an insult to Muslim communities, and will compound the hurt and anguish that is already being felt.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
