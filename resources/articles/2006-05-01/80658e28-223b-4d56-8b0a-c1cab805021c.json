The thought of your punishment intoxicates me with joy.\" Many shared her view. Until a few days before his arrest, Robespierre had been one of the most powerful men in France, presiding over the most violent and repressive phase of the French revolution with a zeal that was part idealism, part crazed paranoia. He imposed press censorship, ruthlessly extinguished his enemies and instituted laws that enabled him to send thousands to their deaths without trial. Yet others just as sincerely mourned his death as the passing of the last pure defender of the dream of democracy. Years after his death one of his supporters wrote: \"I would have given my life to save Robespierre, whom I loved like a brother. No one knows better than I do how sincere, disinterested and absolute his devotion to the republic was.\" Robespierre is a puzzling, deeply troubling figure in the story of the French revolution, and at the outset of this marvellous biography, historian Ruth Scurr sets out the nature of this puzzle clearly. How did an unknown provincial lawyer rise so quickly to such prominence at the political centre of the revolution? How did a man who at one time vehemently campaigned for the abolition of the death penalty come to be a strenuous advocate of execution, not just for the French nobility and obvious political enemies, but for his own closest friends? How could a man who professed undying love for \"the people\" seem to care so little for individual lives? How are we to reconcile the wildly opposing views of Robespierre held both by his contemporaries and historians since? Was he a bloody tyrant, a monster, or a saint? In her account of Robespierre's rise and fall - he was just 36 when he died - Scurr for the most part lets events speak for themselves. The eldest son of a wastrel father, who abandoned his young family the moment his wife died, Robespierre was a sensitive, serious boy, with a long memory for personal slights and a fierce compassion for the vulnerable. Even as a child he had the ability to inspire strong devotion and, equally, hostility. His mother's death when he was six was a devastating event that pushed him further into himself. He never married or even formed a close romantic attachment. Many years later, when his close friend Danton quipped that he practised virtu with his wife in bed each night, prudish Robespierre did not appear to get the joke. The political ideals of the Roman republic, which he learnt at school, and his own reading of the banned but best-selling works of Rousseau, which argued for the inherent goodness of man and the malevolent influence of institutions, came together in Robespierre's mind to form a deep and enduring belief in the ideals of social equality and justice. As a young lawyer he defended the poor, often without payment, and spoke out repeatedly against the death penalty. But at the same time, as Scurr shows, he was ambitious and already had a high opinion of himself. In his inaugural speech to the Academy of Arras, he declared: \"A man of high principle will be ready to sacrifice to the state his wealth, his life, his very nature - everything, indeed, except his honour.\" Clearly, he thought he was just such a man. Big ideals - honour, justice, liberty, virtue, duty - were high on Robespierre's personal and political agenda from early adulthood. As revolutionary sentiments spread, aided by poor harvests and food shortages, they became his pass to political power. There is invariably a case of \"right time, right place\" in the story of how individuals rise to fame and Robespierre is no exception. The moment the Estates General was recalled in early 1789, he recognised and seized his moment. Like Hitler in 1930s Germany, his own private theme chimed perfectly with that of the times. His sense of grievance, his aversion to injustice, his sensitivity to inequality found their perfect public expression. From the day of his election to the Estates General, he scarcely paused in his political ascent. Scurr brilliantly evokes the sheer speed and intensity of change after the fall of the Bastille. She manages to be low-key but effective in recreating the fervid, volatile and bloodthirsty atmosphere that enveloped France and especially Paris between 1789 and 1794. At the heart of it all sat Robespierre, the Incorruptible as he was now known, constantly manoeuvring for his own safety and advancement, defending himself on the grounds of his love for the revolution and the people. \"In the realm of political action,\" wrote Isaiah Berlin, \"laws are far and few indeed: skills are everything.\" As Scurr shows, this was the fatal weakness in Robespierre: his reliance on the law in the absence of any real political sensitivity. He depended on lucky breaks, eloquence, staunch supporters and, above all, on his zealous adherence to principles and laws. Equality and liberty stood in for lack of real understanding of, or sympathy for, the complexity of human relations. He had none of what Berlin calls the gift for compromise that stems from that understanding, and which is essential in wise statesmanship. Instead, he used an increasingly fanatical idealism to justify the extermination of anyone who opposed his vision. He employed his considerable talent as a lawyer to protect his ideals in law, whatever the cost. There is an unmistakable irony in the fact that the same man who once vehemently argued for the abolition of the death penalty should only a few years later be imposing laws that deprived people of anything resembling a fair trial. The terrible Law of Prairial, initiated by Robespierre, meant that people could be sentenced to death merely on the suspicion of being an enemy of the revolution. \"Summary execution was the order of the day,\" writes Scurr. \"Robespierre and the republic became one and the same tyrant.\" Scurr's stated ambition to express \"neither partisan adulation nor exaggerated animosity\" is admirable and largely successful. I felt at times, however, that she has erred on the side of being too forgiving. The concluding chapters are weakened in some ways by her refusal to take sides in the long-running tyrant/hero debate. The psychological insights into Robespierre's character that make for such compelling reading in the early chapters are still implicitly present, but in the face of Robespierre's horrific conduct, could perhaps have done with a more strenuous reiteration. For Scurr, Robespierre's intense identification with the revolution remains sincere and credible, even if the actions this led to are not morally justifiable. I'm not so sure. Scurr's own account of the last two years of Robespierre's life provides ample evidence of a man who, however incorruptible in his private conduct, had become profoundly corrupted by power and by the mad workings of his own paranoid imagination. Consequentialist thinking is commonplace in political leaders in times of war - one thinks of Churchill imposing food sanctions on starving civilians in Europe or authorising the fire-bombing campaigns in Germany. But ends do not always justify means, and in the case of Robespierre, the frenzied idealism that so clearly preserved his own political safety seems far harder to condone. That said, Fatal Purity remains an immensely thought-provoking biography, not only of Robespierre the man, but of the revolution he became so identified with, both in his own mind and other people's. There is scarcely a single page that does not raise important and compelling questions about the dangers of unbridled idealism. This is not just a portrait of a complex historical figure, or the political upheaval in which he played such a decisive part, but a profound meditation on the fact that political change is always driven by individuals not just ideals, and how easily even the noblest of ideals can tip into lethal fanaticism. Above all, Fatal Purity is a timely reminder of just how perilous and fragile the journey from tyranny to political freedom has been, and indeed still is in so many countries today. \u00b7 Rebecca Abrams is writing a novel set in the 18th century.
