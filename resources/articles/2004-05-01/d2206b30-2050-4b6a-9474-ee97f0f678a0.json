Ciss\u00e9 scored 26 goals and was involved in all Auxerre's league matches. He is now on his way to Liverpool and is a fantastic buy. Young player of the year S\u00e9bastien Squillaci (Monaco) In a back four with an average age of 23, Squillaci was outstanding - so much so that Jacques Santini, the France coach, called him up this month for a series of physical tests in case of injury to one of his defenders before Euro 2004. Squillaci is destined for better things and possibly a move to England. Flop of the season Monaco Fabien Barthez's blunders in Europe for Marseille caught the eye but the collapse of Monaco in the final months of the season, comparable to that of Real Madrid in Spain, pushed them from title favourites to needing victory against Porto in tomorrow's final to avoid having to qualify for the Champions League. English lessons for Euro 2004 Santini has omitted the Lyon strikers Sidney Govou and Pegguy Luyindula from his squad, which should please England as they have been brilliant. Beno\u00eet Pedretti from Sochaux (on his way to Marseille) and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rothen from Monaco are midfielders who will harm England if involved - although Robert Pires and Zinedine Zidane stand in their way. French lessons for Euro 2004 Even though most of the French stars play abroad, the general feeling in the country is that France are too good to be beaten. But, then again, that was the feeling before the 2002 World Cup. If Zidane is not fit, if Thierry Henry and David Tr\u00e9zeguet do not play as team-mates, and if Barthez plays instead of Gregory Coupet, France will not win. Simple as that. Xavier Rivoire is French editor of Champions Magazine Germany Season in brief Champions Werder Bremen Champions League Bayern Munich, Bayer Leverkusen Relegated Eintracht, 1860 Munich, Cologne Player of the year Ailton (Werder Bremen) A ball-shaped joker but fast like a bullet, the Brazilian scored 28 goals in 33 matches. Reminds the Germans of their legendary striker Gerd M\u00fcller. Schalke 04 admire him so much they have signed him and doubled his salary. Young player of the year Lukas Podolski (Cologne) The 18-year-old striker was promoted to the senior team in mid-season, going on to score 10 times in 19 matches, one third of Cologne's goals but not enough to prevent relegation. Of the Germany team he said: \"If Rudi V\u00f6ller needs me in Portugal, I'm sure he will find out my number.\" One place remains in the squad and Podoski's phone is on. Flop of the season Tomas Rosicky (B Dortmund) The 23-year-old broke his arm, injured his back, underwent an appendectomy and achieved nothing. The Czech international scored twice and had no assists. Touted for a \u20ac25m move to Chelsea in January, he started the last two matches on the bench. English lessons for Euro 2004 Seven Bundesliga players will play for Croatia in Portugal but only the German-born Ivan Klasnic, who scored 13 goals for Bremen, really caught the eye. Similarly the France duo Willy Sagnol and Bixente Lizarazu were barely above average. The Swiss defenders Raphael Wicky and Bruno Berner were among the stronger players for Hamburg and Freiburg. German lessons for Euro 2004 For most national supporters the best news came when Carsten Ramelow retired. The 30-year-old Leverkusen defender has been blamed for the hesitant, ugly performances of V\u00f6ller's side. Oliver Kahn and Michael Ballack have not shone, although rising stars in the squad include Stuttgart's youngsters Andreas Hinkel, Phillip Lahm and forward Kevin Kuranyi. V\u00f6ller's selection of the striker Thomas Brdaric, who scored 12 goals for almost-relegated Hanover 96, suggests he has one eye on World Cup 2006. Italy Season in brief Champions Milan Champions League Roma, Juventus, Internazionale Relegated Modena, Empoli, Ancona Player of the year Francesco Totti (Roma) Italy's most talented player has enjoyed playing alongside Antonio Cassano, who finally seems close to unlocking his enormous potential, in Roma's attack. Totti scored a personal best of 20 goals, carrying Roma along on his back at times. Young player of the year Alberto Gilardino (Parma) Born on July 5 1982, the day Paolo Rossi scored a famous hat-trick against Brazil, Gilardino started the season as cover for Adriano in Parma's attack. The Italy Under-21 forward scored 23 goals in a variety of ways: with both feet and he scored a few headers. He is now considered the new Rossi. Flop of the season Pavel Nedved (Juventus) Juventus had a disappointing season and the Czech midfielder, who led them to the Scudetto and Champions League final the previous year, was unrecognisable. The 2003 European footballer of the year had his worst season in Serie A. English lessons for Euro 2004 The France striker David Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet had a troubled season with injuries and contract disputes but still managed 16 goals in 25 matches. Lilian Thuram was less brilliant than usual as Juve conceded 42 goals. The Croatian defender Igor Tudor struggled with injuries and the veteran forward Milan Rapaic scored four goals after joining Ancona in January. Italian lessons for Euro 2004 After an all-Italian Champions League final last season, Serie A fell back to earth with no teams reaching the semi-finals. The form of players like Totti and Cassano give optimism but key players like Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Del Piero and Christian Vieri had poor seasons and the Azzurri need them at their best in Portugal. Spain Season in brief Champions Valencia Champions League Barcelona, Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a, Real Madrid Relegated Valladolid, Celta Vigo, Murcia Player of the year Ronaldinho (Barcelona) The man Real Madrid deemed \"too ugly\" to be a gal\u00e1ctico has got Camp Nou purring again with his outrageous ability and fantasy flicks, his desire and commitment and child-like enthusiasm. Truly brilliant. Young player of the year Fernando Torres (A Madrid) It is easy to forget that Torres is only 20. With pace, skill and 19 goals, including an incredible Matrix-style flying volley, the Atl\u00e9tico striker has looked every inch the superstar. Flop of the season Ra\u00fal (Real Madrid) A lost soul, Ra\u00fal scored only twice in 2004 while contributing nothing of note. Slow, wasteful and drifting ever deeper, Madrid's captain had a desperate season. English lessons for Euro 2004 Good news is that Zinedine Zidane, looking physically and emotionally shattered, endured the worst season of his career. The bad news is that a break and a return to France is the fillip he needs. Spanish lessons for Euro 2004 Valencia's league win was based on a Spanish nucleus which will be well represented in Portugal. David Albelda and Rub\u00e9n Baraja are the country's best central midfield partnership, and the winger Vicente ran Ronaldinho close as player of the year. Tiredness will be an issue, especially among Real's burnt-out players Ra\u00fal, Ivan Helguera and Michel Salgado."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
