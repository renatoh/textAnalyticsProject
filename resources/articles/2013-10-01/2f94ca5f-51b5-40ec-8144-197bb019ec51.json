While these items may have a limited life span, the metals inside them don't, and when recycled properly can be used over and over in new devices. Currently, a half million tonnes of e-waste is discarded each year in India, but almost 95% is still recycled in the informal sector, according to recent estimates. Typically, the neighbourhood kabadiwala, the Hindustani term for junk dealer, collects the material. Then using crude extraction methods, such as acid stripping and open burning, workers recover small amounts of reusable metal. Anything left over is thrown in the local water stream or scrapyard. Not only is the process inefficient, it is harmful to the environment and to the people involved, mostly women and children who work with no protective gear. Recognising the opportunity to turn an environmental disaster into a business plan, Gupta and his brother launched Attero, Latin for \"waste,\" in 2007. Today, Attero is the leading e-waste recycler in India, according to Gupta, handling almost 500 tonnes of e-waste every month. The company's success is based on its widespread collection system, now operating in 22 states across the country, and its innovative, four-stage recycling technology, which recovers valuable metals \u2013 rare earths, precious metals and base metals \u2013without fouling the local environment. Its process is also cheaper than existing methods, says Gupta, so it can operate profitably in areas with limited amounts of recyclable material to feed the process. Beyond the innovative technology, a strong social mission also drives Attero. This year, the company partnered with the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group, to launch the Clean E-India Initiative, an effort to integrate informal waste collectors in an organised supply network. \"These people don't lose jobs, we don't displace them,\" says Gupta. Instead, \"The people who are being formalised end up making three times more than they were before.\" Attero also stages educational events at schools to raise awareness about the hazards of e-waste and organise collection drives. For electronics manufacturers, Attero offers a cheaper source of these critical metals compared with buying virgin metals extracted from mines. \"The cost of extraction of gold from e-waste is at least 40% less than the lowest-cost gold mine in the world, if you have figured out the technology,\" he notes. It appears, Attero has figured it out. Its revenues will reach about $27m this year and are growing quickly. The company's unique recycling process is currently patent-pending. Gupta and his brother have plans to expand operations to other developing countries and eventually to big markets such as the US. \"As the demand for electronics increases, so will the demand for these metals,\" says Gupta. \"A sustainable future is when a percentage of this demand is met with a recycled stream.\" Join the community of sustainability professionals and experts.
