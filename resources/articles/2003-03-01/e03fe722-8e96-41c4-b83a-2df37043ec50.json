Years of occasionally violent separatist campaigning against France, together with a proud and well-documented history of inter-family blood feuds, exceeding in ferocity even those of Sicily, combined to produce an air of menace. One result is that Corsica, one of the most stunning islands in the Mediterranean, has been largely spared the mass tourism that has ravaged so much of southern Europe. The combination of breathtaking beauty with emptiness is unnerving. I spent two hot June days with my family by the River Solenzara, just a few miles inland from the town of the same name on the east coast of the island. The river, bright blue as it tumbles between smooth, white boulders, sometimes slows into large pools wide and warm enough to make them perfect for a swim. In the background, serrated granite ridges give way to thick pine and chestnut forest. And yet, apart from goats clambering across the rocks and the fish which swarmed around our legs as we swam, we saw just two couples during the entire time, both of whom moved quickly on to find their own, undisturbed bit of paradise. Corsica fills up during the high season with French and Italian holidaymakers. But none of the resorts we visited in the southern half of the island displayed any of the scars of mass tourism. There are no high-rise developments along the coast. There is little of the concrete scurf of cafes and shops that disfigures so many Mediterranean beaches. During the June half-term holiday, the whole island seemed deserted. On our way from the airport to our resort, we had the roads that snake around the southern tip, from the city of Ajaccio to Porto Vecchio, almost to ourselves. The twisting routes between the coastal plain and the mountains that rear dramatically upwards into the centre of the island make travelling laborious, with journeys between coastal towns deceptively long. But the scenery is superb - from the deep fjords of the western coastline round to the stunning beaches on the eastern seaboard, through the maquis - the scrubland of thorns, rosemary, juniper and broom that covers the lowlands - to the range of jagged granite peaks that form the island's spine. Porto Vecchio has enough of its sixteenth-century Genoese port remaining to make it worth a visit, even if its surroundings are becoming marred by the kind of road junctions and industrial buildings which now ring so many mainland French towns. But its tiny shaded square and warren of narrow streets make it a fine base, with dozens of reasonable restaurants selling fresh seafood (the ubiquitous fish soup is a must) and pasta dishes, some offering views across the neighbouring salt flats to the port. The shops are fun too - my daughter spent hours (and lots of euros) buying minute glass animals made on the spot by a family of Italian craftsmen. We spent most mornings around the villa, set amid a sprawl of small stone holiday cottages spread across a hillside a few miles from the town. The villa was a modern, jumbled pile of pink concrete walls and marble floors with its own courtyard and tiny pool carved out of the hillside. The cottages were spartan, but shared a beautiful, large pool set among the pines and cork trees and enjoyed fabulous views across the hills towards the town. Just a few miles south of Porto Vecchio is the beach of Palombaggia, a gorgeous semi-circle of pale sand fringed by pine trees and curious pink rock outcrops. In July and August, the guides say, it is impossible to find space on the beach, considered the finest on the island - in June it was deserted. If there are few humans to spoil the spring beauty of Corsica, another creature is trying its hardest. At first the bugs that drop down from the trees act as an amusing diversion for the children. Then you realise that the whole tree above you is alive with tens of thousands of wriggling caterpillars, and that the rustling you can hear is the branches of the trees - many of them cork oaks, whose trunks have already been stripped to make corks for wine bottles - being denuded of their remaining leaves. Then you see that bright green foliage covering the mountainsides has been eaten away across great swathes of the southern half of the island. Locals shrug their shoulders and say that after a few seasons the insects will move to another region. In the meantime they make an eerie sight. A few hours' drive from Porto Vecchio is the Renaissance citadel town of Bonifacio, perched on top of a steep limestone peninsula that juts out into the sea from the southern tip of the island. The town is a fascinating jumble of cobbled streets, with views through the citadel's battlements across the sea towards Sardinia. The restaurants that line the southern fringe of the haute-ville are overpriced and ordinary, except in one stomach-churning respect - many of them overhang sheer white cliffs that plunge down hundreds of feet into the sea below. It is the hint of menace that you feel in the back alleyways of Bonifacio that gives a clue to one of Corsica's attractions. It is an edgy and untamed island, its gorgeous but wild mountain ranges and great deserted stretches of coastline in such stark contrast to the cultivated beauty of so much of the European Mediterranean.
