Lola, whose car Nigel Mansell drove to victory in the 1993 IndyCar championship, have designed a new carbon fibre bob which they believe to be the lightest ever built and hope will be much faster than the one Britain used at the 1998 Nagano Olympics, when they won the bronze medal in the four-man event. The bob will be tested in La Plagne, France, this weekend and then officially unveiled at Lola's headquarters in Huntington during a special ceremony on Monday. \"It's the technology which has proved so successful in motor racing superimposed on bobsleigh,\" said Chris Bibb of Lola. \"The bobs should provide our teams with a great advantage in Salt Lake City.\" Bobsleigh technology has hardly progressed during the last 20 years and many squads, including Britain, are still using machines designed by the former East Germany. Lola designed the bobs after the British team approached them for sponsorship. \"We thought using the technology we have at our disposal to help them would be much more beneficial than just giving them cash,\" said Bibb. It could be just the boost Britain's flagging team need to make an impact in the Olympics. The two teams, driven by Neil Scarisbrick and Lee Johnston respectively, have struggled to replicate the successes of four years ago. GB1's best performance so far this season was seventh in Lake Placid in November. Of the four-man team who unexpectedly finished third in Nagano in 1998 only Paul Atwood and Dean Ward will be among those competing in Salt Lake after the driver Sean Olsson was controversially left out. Among those also selected is the former sprinter Marcus Adam, the 1990 Commonwealth 200m champion. \"This is the start of a four- or five-year deal,\" said Bibb. \"There is a lot more that can be done but we've only had a limited time to work with the squads. But they will be testing their new machines at the weekend and then fine tuning things in Calgary.\" It is not the first occasion on which a motor racing manufacturer has applied its technology to another sport: the bicycle Chris Boardman used during his attempts on the world hour record were designed by Lotus cars. Meanwhile Alex Coomber, Britain's biggest hope of success in Salt Lake, has tried to play down her position as favourite in the skeleton bob after being crowned World Cup champion for the third consecutive season last week. \"I'm not even thinking about winning golds and what that might mean,\" said Coomber, a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force. \"The difference between success and failure over two runs of a mile can come down to a centimetre- and-a-half. \"I am going into the Olympics as the world No1 and I have beaten the best in the world but anything can happen on the day.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
