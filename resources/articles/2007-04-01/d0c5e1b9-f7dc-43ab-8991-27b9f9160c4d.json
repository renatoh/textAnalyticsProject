It is now, according to Oxfam, \"the greatest concentration of human suffering in the world\", and the Norwegian Refugee Council says Sudan has a larger number of internally displaced people than any other country. Oxfam yesterday launched a campaign to get more food aid to people in the camps, their numbers daily swelled by raids on what intact communities remain in Darfur and parts of eastern Chad. Two secretary generals of the United Nations have pleaded with the Sudanese authorities, with African governments, and with western states. The Sudanese government, fighting to control the south and reluctant to give up any instrument useful to that purpose, has neither reined in the militia groups responsible for the worst violence, nor permitted outside forces to enter the region in sufficient strength to do so. The Africans took a long time to reach a collective position, and even longer to come up with troops for a force which has nevertheless proved unequal to the task of restoring order. The US and other western states have also been reluctant to provide troops, or to tackle the difficult diplomatic task of persuading those in power in Khartoum that Washington's real purpose is not to bring them down. How much progress is represented by the agreement reached over the weekend on the implementation of a plan to reorganise international forces in Darfur is hard to know. The new force will be larger and better equipped, but still mainly African and commanded by an African soldier. That can be seen as concession to \"African sensibilities\" or to Khartoum's belief that it can manipulate and, if it wishes, obstruct African units more easily than non-African ones, or troops of any background with first-class equipment. Much of the argument since the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, and the Sudanese president, Omar al-Bashir, agreed on the expansion and strengthening of international forces in principle in March, seems to have revolved around the question of whether they could or could not have attack helicopters. Troops, whatever their numbers, are in any case only part of the solution in any overall strategy for a settlement, especially difficult because the rebels are now so fragmented. John Negroponte, deputy US secretary of state, was firm yesterday in Khartoum, saying Sudan faced further isolation if it did not change its policies. The tough approach is right, but only if the Sudanese can be convinced outsiders want to help them get out of the hole they have dug for themselves rather than to bury them in it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
