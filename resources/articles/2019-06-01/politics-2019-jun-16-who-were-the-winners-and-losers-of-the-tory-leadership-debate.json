They stayed mostly civil towards each other, but Jeremy Hunt called out Johnson\u2019s no-show and four of them ganged up on Dominic Raab over his openness to forcing through a no-deal Brexit without the permission of parliament. Jeremy Hunt Overall pitch Hunt stressed that he is an entrepreneur with the negotiating skills to get a better deal with the EU. Best line I just want to say: where is Boris? If his team won\u2019t let him out to debate with five pretty friendly colleagues, how is he going to get on with 27 European colleagues? He should be here to answer that question. Worst moment He laid on the reminders that he used to be a successful businessman a bit too thickly. Still in the race? It was a steady but not stellar performance from Hunt who is hoping to stay in second position and make the final two. He distinguished himself mostly by being the only one to call out Johnson for not turning up. Overall rating 4/5 Michael Gove Overall pitch Gove presented himself as a true Brexit believer for whom getting out of the EU is personal, but he also emphasised his history of delivering difficult political goals against the odds. Best line You must allow parliament to vote. You cannot leave unless parliament votes for it, Dom [Raab]. I will defend our democracy and you cannot take Britain out of the EU against the will of parliament. Worst moment Patronisingly ticking off Channel 4\u2019s moderator Krishnan Guru-Murthy and telling him now was the time for him to listen. There were also a couple of cringeworthy lines about looking for the treasure in everyone\u2019s hearts and wanting to make children his political priority. Still in the race? He is still in contention for second place on the shortlist opposite Johnson and he ratcheted up the passion about Brexit, but this was not a standout performance. His best moments were a fierce defence of Javid over the challenge that he was not a big enough figure to be invited to the Donald Trump state visit dinner, and an attack on Raab for suggesting he could deliver Brexit without the permission of parliament. Overall rating 3/5 Sajid Javid Overall pitch Javid set out the case that he is an outsider and not from central casting of the Conservative party as a working class son of a bus driver who has made it to home secretary. Best line We are not selecting a dictator of this country. We are choosing a prime minister of this country \u2026 You don\u2019t deliver on democracy by trashing democracy. Worst moment He stumbled over his words on a few occasions. Still in the race? Javid gave a strong answer on the need to defeat racism and embrace modern Britain. However, he is struggling to win over MPs despite his impressive back story and it does not feel like this performance will move the dial. Overall rating 3/5 Dominic Raab Overall pitch Raab\u2019s refrain is that he is the only candidate who can be trusted to take the UK out of the EU by the end of October. He said politicians need to keep their promises on Brexit and claimed to be the only one who would do so. Best line We\u2019ve got to show people who feel left behind that we\u2019re on their side. This is very tangible ... I want a fairer society, not just a fairer economy. Worst moment Accusing Stewart of wanting to turn the UK into Venezuela over his citizens\u2019 assembly idea was a low point. Still in the race? Raab spoke competently and delivered good answers on opening up education more but had no answer to how he would take the UK out of the EU with no deal without suspending parliament. Overall rating 2/5 Rory Stewart Overall pitch Stewart made the case that a no-deal Brexit is a complete nonsense and painted the other candidates as unrealistic. He also highlighted his efforts to listen to what people in the country during his walking tours of Britain as part of the leadership contest. Best line The fundamental issue here is there is a competition of machismo. Everyone is saying \u2018I\u2019m tougher\u2019. Every time I have this debate everyone is like, \u2018trust me, I\u2019m the guy, I can defeat the impossible odds\u2019. And I\u2019m accused of being a defeatist by trying to be realistic. It reminds me of trying to cram a whole series of rubbish bags into the rubbish bin \u2026 I was tempted to say believe in the bin, believe in Britain. It\u2019s nonsense. Worst moment He repeatedly urged Guru-Murthy and others to let him finish speaking, sounding petulant and wasting valuable debating time. Still in the race? Stewart is not expected to soar past the others into second place to take on Johnson. However, he had the best lines and gave the best challenge, grilling Raab on what the tariff on cheddar would be under a no-deal Brexit. Even though he is unlikely to make the cut, he was the most articulate of the five and got a lot of audience appreciation. Overall rating 5/5"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
