Or, you back the opponents of a Premiership side, hoping that they will be facing understudies, only to discover that they are confronted by the real stars. In the Carling Cup, it is essential to know how seriously a manager treats the competition. So who can be trusted to field a strong line-up and who cannot? Step forward the Aston Villa manager David O'Leary. Only once has O'Leary picked a player for the Carling Cup who would have been a surprise selection in the Premiership: Gary Cahill, a young left-back, was given his debut in this season's 8-3 victory at Wycombe. O'Leary knows that Villa will not win the Premiership, and that they are unlikely to win the FA Cup, which also tends to be dominated by the elite clubs - Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool. If Villa are ever going to win a trophy, their best chance is in the Carling Cup. It is worth the effort, because the winners go into the Uefa Cup. It is hard to understand why so many managers of other non-elite Premiership clubs adopt a completely different approach - selecting the weaker squad players for a competition in which they have the best chance of success. Step forward Fulham's manager Chris Coleman. The players who started Fulham's Carling Cup second-round tie at home to Lincoln have, between them, made eight starts this season in the Premiership. It is easy to understand why Fulham required extra-time for a 5-4 victory over some League Two also-rans. And it was not a one-off selection. The now-traditional selection of reserves by elite clubs is perfectly logical: they can expect to qualify for Europe from their league position.
