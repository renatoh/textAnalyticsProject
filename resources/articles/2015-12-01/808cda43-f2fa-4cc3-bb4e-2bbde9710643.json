William \u201cBill\u201d Lincoln, 60, who suffers from sleep apnoea, bladder problems and severe osteoarthritis which has led to him having a double hip replacement, denies taking part in what prosecutors called the biggest burglary in English history over Easter weekend. Asked where he was in the early hours of Good Friday, Lincoln told jurors on Wednesday he had been buying fish at Billingsgate fish market \u2013 as he did every Friday. Lincoln claimed that he remembered being at the market at around 5am on 3 April \u2013 the first night of the burglary \u2013 because data from his mobile phone shows he made a call to \u201cJimmy Two Baths\u201d. He had earlier promised to introduce his friend to the fishmongers at the market so he could buy his own seafood. Explaining who this was, he told jurors he met \u201cJimmy\u201d at Porchester Hall Steam Baths in Westminster where visitors would give each other baths. Lincoln said: \u201c[He\u2019s called] Jimmy Two Baths because he goes down twice.\u201d His barrister, Mark Tomassi, asked him: \u201cWere you involved in the burglary at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit?\u201d Lincoln replied: \u201cNo, sir.\u201d When asked if he was able to understand the charges against him, he said: \u201cI am not a divvo, but I am not the sharpest knife in the drawer.\u201d As a result of his ailments, the defendant is unable to work and receives disability living allowance and employment support allowance. Lincoln broke down in tears as he recalled an incident with his grandson \u2013 the \u201clight of his life\u201d \u2013 which saw him end up in an induced coma in hospital. The court heard he had been asked by his daughter to look after the youngster but he was unable to, and while under the care of someone else the then two-year-old suffered a head injury. Earlier on Wednesday, another of the defendants broke down in tears as his wife told the jury he was with her at home on the night the burglary took place. Carl Wood, 58, wiped tears from eyes with a handkerchief as his wife of 19 years, Paula, told the jury at Woolwich crown court that Wood was in bed with her on the night of 4 April. She told the court her husband had not spent a full night away from home since he was in his 20s. Wood is accused of being one of the men who broke into the safe deposit building on the night of 2 April. He is alleged to have returned on the night of 4 April, but walked away from the job after finding the fire escape door closed. Wood denies the charges and says he was at home. Dressed in a pastel-green woollen sweater, Paula Wood told the court that she and her husband had hosted a barbecue at their home in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, on 4 April but it was a \u201cflop\u201d after her daughter and Wood\u2019s friend Daniel \u201cDanny\u201d Jones had both pulled out. Jones, 60, has admitted his role in the burglary and hiding his loot in a cemetery. Wood, who suffers from Crohn\u2019s disease, had earlier repeatedly denied being one of the men who entered the vault at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit. Ringleaders Brian Reader, 76, John \u201cKenny\u201d Collins, 75, Jones and Terry Perkins, 67, have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary between 17 May 2014 and 7.30am on 5 April this year. Lincoln, 60, of Bethnal Green, east London, and Jon Harbinson, 42, of Benfleet, Essex, are on trial accused of the same offence. A fourth man, plumbing engineer Hugh Doyle, 48, of Enfield, north London, is jointly charged with them on one count of conspiracy to conceal, convert or transfer criminal property between 1 January and 19 May. He also faces an alternative charge of concealing, converting or transferring criminal property between 1 April and 19 May. One of the thieves, a red-haired man known only as Basil, has not yet been identified. The trial continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
