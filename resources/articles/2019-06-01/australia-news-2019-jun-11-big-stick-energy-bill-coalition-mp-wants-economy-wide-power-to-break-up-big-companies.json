The Queensland National, who has been one of the most vocal advocates of the \u201cbig stick\u201d legislation, which allows energy companies to be broken up if they engage in price gouging, says a power to break up big companies should apply right across the economy, not just in the energy sector. Asked whether he supported a proposal by the Centre Alliance to broaden the divestiture power, Pitt told Guardian Australia: \u201cI agree with them.\u201d \u201cThis has been the position of the Nationals and supported by Nationals members for a long time. It\u2019s been debated previously, and we know this type of legislation is in place in other major economies such as the United States and Britain and been very successful,\u201d he said. Asked whether he would support non-government amendments when the package is debated in the new parliament, Pitt said: \u201cI don\u2019t support anything I haven\u2019t seen and I\u2019m yet to read anything that\u2019s been put forward, but in terms of a general principle, I certainly support extending divestiture powers, particularly into areas like the supermarket duopoly, which we know has been detrimental to regional producers for a very long time.\u201d Given Scott Morrison post-election governs in majority, the government should be able to steer the package through the lower house without amendments, unless Pitt is joined by more Nationals colleagues in a concerted push to broaden the divestiture proposal in the current legislation. The package is also vulnerable during Senate debate in the event any Nationals decide to break ranks. Any effort by the Nationals to beef up the divestiture power proposed in the big stick package would prompt significant pushback from Liberals. Liberals have already forced changes to the government package on the basis they were philosophically uncomfortable with it, because breaking up private companies offends core liberal values. The government had to overhaul its original proposal last December because of concerns expressed by a number of Liberal backbenchers. The energy sector and major business groups are also vociferous opponents of the package and have engaged in a substantial lobbying effort to try to scuttle it. Fearing pre-election the package was going to be put on the go slow, Pitt was one of a group of Nationals including George Christensen, Michelle Landry, Ken O\u2019Dowd, Llew O\u2019Brien and Barry O\u2019Sullivan who put their leader, Michael McCormack, and the energy minister, Angus Taylor, on notice that the \u201cbig stick\u201d package needed to be passed as a matter of priority. The same group is also championing government underwriting for a new coal-fired power station in Queensland. Taylor has indicated the \u201cbig stick\u201d package will return for consideration when the new parliament reconvenes in July. At the end of May, the Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick told Guardian Australia he would look to \u201cbroaden the application of divestiture across all sectors of the economy\u201d once the divestiture package reached the Senate, because once the principle was accepted for one sector, it should be universally applied. Patrick also criticised the Morrison government for having a \u201chodgepodge\u201d energy policy, and he said Centre Alliance positions on energy matters would be determined \u201cin the context of providing clean, reliable and affordable power for Australians\u201d. Crossbench amendments are relevant if Labor continues to oppose the package, which it did during the last parliament. The new Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has so far declined to say whether or not Labor will maintain that position in the new term."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
