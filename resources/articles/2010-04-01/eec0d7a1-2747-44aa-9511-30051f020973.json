Dave Prentis's office has asked us to make clear that this is not the case. Labour has recruited one of Britain's most prominent Asian businessmen to launch a last-ditch appeal for general election funds, amid fears that it is facing a multi-million pound shortfall in donations. Sir Gulam Noon, the packaged food tycoon, has given up his non-domicile tax status and become an assistant treasurer of the party. Since taking up the post a month ago, he has personally donated \u00a3200,000 to the campaign and has raised a further \u00a3250,000 from other Muslim businessmen. The disclosures show that party officials are, at this late hour, still trying to raise enough money to run a competitive campaign against the cash-rich Tories. The decision to recruit a tycoon to woo other wealthy backers will be seized upon by critics as proof that the party's Obama-style strategy of seeking smaller donations from greater numbers of supporters has failed. Noon, known as the Curry King, said that he was approached last month by Ray Collins, Labour's general secretary, and asked to take up the new role. \"I have always been a Labour supporter and wanted to ensure that Gordon Brown was given an opportunity to finish off the job that we started under Blair so I accepted Ray's invitation,\" he said. He decided to give up his favourable tax status \u2013 to which he was entitled because he was born in India \u2013 so that he could join the campaign without causing any embarrassment to the party, he claimed. \"This country has been very good to me. I'm no longer a non-dom so I can take up a fuller role in its political and commercial life,\" he said, speaking from his office in St James's Park, central London. Noon is now one of four people who sit on Labour's board of assistant treasurers which was established last September to raise funds for the party. The other members are Jack Dromey, the party's lay treasurer, Nigel Doughty, founder of an equity firm, and Dave Prentis, Unison's general secretary. The Mumbai-born tycoon said that he has raised the money from 10 Muslim businessmen, and is planning to raise another \u00a350,000 by the end of the month. He declined to name the donors and said that he does not know if any of those giving money were domiciled abroad. Labour insiders said last night that the party is still \"quite a few million\" short of the \u00a318m maximum that can be spent on the general election campaign. The Tories are understood to have raised more than they can spend. The Guardian revealed in January that Labourt was then \u00a310m short and had devised a \"cascade\" campaign in which current supporters solicit more donations from contacts and friends. The aim was to build up an extensive network of people willing to give between \u00a310,000 and \u00a320,000. The Conservatives raised nearly double the money of the rival main parties, according to the last quarterly figures from the Electoral Commission. They received more than \u00a310m compared with Labour's \u00a34.9m and the Liberal Democrats' \u00a31m in the last three months of 2009. The figures revealed the gulf in party funding sources, with the Conservatives largely reliant on donations from the City and wealthy individuals and Labour increasingly dependent on the unions. Last week Lord Sugar, the enterprise tsar, donated \u00a3400,000 to Labour. His show of support came as many other business leaders publicly supported the Conservatives over their manifesto pledge to block most of Labour's planned increase in national insurance next year. Noon, 74, has given nearly \u00a3700,000 to Labour over the last 10 years but has not given a donation of more than \u00a35,000 since the last election. He was questioned under caution by police in 2005 as part of Scotland Yard's investigation into the alleged sale of honours in exchange for loans towards Labour's last general election campaign. It emerged that he had secretly lent \u00a3250,000 to Labour weeks before he was nominated by Tony Blair for a peerage. At the time he maintained that he was told by a senior Labour official not to declare the donation on a form submitted to the House of Lords authorities and was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing. Yesterday, he disclosed that he has since discussed the so-called \"cash-for-honours\" affair with Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, and said that both had regretted the way his name had been dragged into the inquiry. \"The last prime minister and the present prime minister have both said to me that I was not treated well during the cash for honours affair. But I did not blame anyone and I kept my counsel,\" he said. Noon is the second bigr Labour donor to give up his non-dom status. The move could increase pressure upon the Tories to explain whether Lord Ashcroft is going to maintain his non-domiciled tax status, after funnelling more than \u00a314m into the party.His decision follows that of Lord Paul, the steel magnate who is close to Gordon Brown. He said two months ago that he would also be giving up his preferential tax status."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
