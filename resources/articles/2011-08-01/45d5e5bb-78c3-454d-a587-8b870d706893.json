So seeing one crossing the road last week in the middle of the day was a surprise. It loped across seemingly unconcerned and, judging by its size, it could have been the smaller female. The colour is difficult to describe to give it justice, but I can say it was a rich chocolate brown with a conspicuous and contrasting creamy yellow throat bib. The long, bushy tail was also conspicuous and it was extended as if being used as a balance. Pine martens are normally nocturnal so it could had been disturbed, but if food was short for any kits it could have been hunting during the day. By coincidence, yesterday, there was a pine marten dropping near our house, which is not unusual, but there seemed to be something different about it. Then it dawned on us that it contained no signs of rowan berries. Normally at this time of year they are packed with the undigested remains of the berries and indeed this one was under a rowan tree. While pine martens have the reputation of preying on birds and mammals, these are only part of their diet. Other main foods in the Highlands are invertebrates, fruit and nuts and carrion. Even so they do like birds, as we know since they have taken our light Sussex hens and Indian runner ducks in the past. The reason for no signs of rowan berries, a quick survey showed, is because they are almost non-existent this year. The trees, which are scattered, should be hung with dense clusters of bright red berries but they are virtually bare. Other parts of the Highlands are the same. Why had we not seen this before? We wondered if we had simply not noticed and just accepted the berries would be there."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
