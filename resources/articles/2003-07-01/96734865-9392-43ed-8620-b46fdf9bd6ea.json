The plan was to discredit Haj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and a powerful force in the Middle East, by claiming he was in the pay of Italy - Britain's sworn enemy. Documents backing this claim were to be planted in the Western Desert, according to government files released by the national archives. But Whitehall backed out of the plot because it knew it could not create a paper trail to support the claims. Government documents from 1940 and 1941 show there was top-level interest in what they dubbed \"Action Against the Mufti\", which was to spearheaded by a whispering campaign. Anthony Eden, the then foreign secretary, agreed there should be a propaganda campaign, that had Colonial and War Office approval \"with which we could not be connected\", the documents show. Whitehall and military officials had already ruled out the \"forcible handling\" of the mufti in case it did the government more harm than good. The documents show that Mr Eden; the war secretary, Captain David Margesson; Sir John Dill, the chief imperial general staff; and Britain's highest ranking military officer, General Sir Archibald Wavell, the Commander-in-Chief in India; and Sir Harold MacMichael, the High Commissioner for Palestine, were all informed and asked for their opinions. Lord Lloyd, a military man attached to British headquarters in Cairo, was also contacted. He was considered an expert in the region having served in the Middle East in the first world war and in Egypt between the wars. And the government was also prepared for a row with the BBC over its coverage saying it had used a \"doubtful\" source to break a strict censorship ban throughout the Middle East on the mufti's movements, it emerged. In a document dated January 7 1941, Mr Eden backed the whispering campaign saying that \"urgent action is necessary\" to discredit the mufti in the Arab world. The machinery to carry out such a propaganda campaign was being \"overhauled\", he said, adding: \"Even if he is not a 'grave danger to our war effort' he is certainly an infernal nuisance.\" It was bad timing for an all-out attack on the mufti because the government knew it would have to produce the crucial document proving he was in Italy's pay. In addition the government had settled on the \"sound tactic\" of dealing with its enemies \"one at a time\" and disposing of Iraq's prime minister was a greater priority, Mr Eden said. In a December 1940 document, a Colonial Office official had already stated that \"the sooner, therefore, that we can start 'debunking' him [the mufti] the better\". The official added: \"We must avoid any propaganda reference to documents that do not exist and cannot be produced, and as Captain Margesson points out, if we claimed to have found documents which the Italians knew did not exist, we might compromise the source of our information. \"I feel that we must stick to our original plan of setting the ball rolling by a whispering campaign with which we could not be connected.\" Sir Harold considered the mufti was a \"really great danger\" to the war effort, adding: \"I regard his neutralisation as essential,\" according to a December 1940 telegram. He suggested a general broadcast announcing that Britain had recovered documents in Libya that the mufti was taking money from the Italians to \"raise trouble in Palestine\". Despite his doubts on how much damage the mufti could cause to Britain's war efforts, Gen Wavell also supported the plot. In a December 1940 document to the War Office, he said: \"We have, however, been urging for some time past that our knowledge of Mufti's intrigues with Axis should be used to discredit him and consider this to be absolutely necessary.\" He also pointed out: \"He has been in Iraq now for good many months intriguing his best and there has been little repercussion for Palestine. I believe high handed action for his removal would on balance do us more harm than good and he is possibly less nuisance in Iraq than elsewhere in the Arab world. \"Iraqis are thoroughly unreliable crowd anyhow and probably better he should continue corrupting them than start elsewhere.\" The whispering campaign aimed to undermine the mufti by claiming there were \"serious disputes\" with his supporters because he was in the Italian's pay. It was also to be suggested that there was \"much dissatisfaction\" with his \"autocratic methods\" and in order to strengthen his own position he refused to give any help to those who \"do not follow him blindly,\" the documents said. In Iraq it was to claim that he wanted to fulfil his personal ambitions by trying to persuade the Iraqi government to follow a policy of extreme pan-Arabism, which was contrary to Iraq's interests. This could help spread unrest among the Shias and Kurds because such a policy could make life intolerable for all but Iraq's Sunni element. By October 1941 a row between British officials in Cairo and the BBC was brewing after the corporation broadcast a German radio report of \"unknown authenticity\" that the mufti had reached southern Italy, according to a Foreign Office document. The following month Sir Harold complained internally that both the BBC and Reuters frequently referring to \"the Grand Mufti\". He added: \"The use of this high-sounding title is particularly undesirable as it sustains his waning prestige. \"Correct title is the Mufti of Jerusalem but I would prefer the use of the word Mufti to be dropped as far as possible since it indicates a post of considerable dignity which cannot fall into disrepute whereas Haj Amin can.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
