After Wednesday night\u2019s debacle at Anfield \u2013 the first time Everton have conceded five against Liverpool since Culture Club were No 1 with, aptly enough, Do You Really Want To Hurt Me \u2013 the writing wasn\u2019t so much on the wall as scrawled across the stratosphere in skywriting. From a blue perspective there\u2019s an unfortunate skewed derby dynamic on Merseyside these days \u2013 it\u2019s how Espanyol, 1860 Munich and Racing Club de Paris must feel \u2013 so there\u2019s no shame in being duffed up by this Liverpool side. But it\u2019s not really supposed to be this way, Silva having been furnished with well over \u00a3110m of fresh talent this summer and \u00a3100m-worth of the same in 2018, and his whole top-flight career is beginning to smack of the emperor\u2019s new clothes. Being charitable, Silva\u2019s Premier League win percentage (33.7%) with Hull, Watford and Everton puts him up there with stalwarts like Alan Pardew (34%), Ailsa from Home and Away (33.9%) and Chris Coleman (32.9%). On the other hand, Silva\u2019s Premier League win percentage (33.7%) with Hull, Watford and Everton puts him up there with stalwarts like Alan Pardew (34%), Ailsa from Home and Away (33.9%) and Chris Coleman (32.9%). What next for the Goodison faithful, then? David Moyes, who bid the club a tearful farewell in 2013 after 11 years at the helm and has since gone on to have a storied and glorious time with Manchester United (11 months, sacked), Real Sociedad (12 months, sacked), Sunderland (10 months, resigned) and West Ham (six months, \u201cWe feel that it is right to move in a different direction\u201d), is the frontrunner, which is something of a novelty for him.

But then he ran out in front of a line of traffic. He put his parts on the bonnet of the car next to me. I have never seen anything like it\u201d \u2013 a witness reports how traffic for the Merseyside derby got backed up when a naked man popped up on the West Derby Road before being detained by police. TOP 100! The countdown continues: from 100 to 11 on our 2019 list of the best female players in the world. FIVER LETTERS \u201cWhen Everton were formed in the 19th century, they were known as St Domingo FC \u2013 named in honour of the patron saint of astronomers. Rather appropriately, the bewildered Blues left Anfield seeing stars\u201d \u2013 Mark McFadden. \u201cIs Megan Rapinoe really sure she wants Cristiano Ronaldo involved in her fight against sexism (yesterday\u2019s News, Bits and Bobs)? It seems a bit like asking Boris Johnson to join your campaign to promote contraception, or the use of lie detector machines, or, well, anything really\u201d \u2013 Michael Hann. \u201cI see prize after prize being handed out for letters o\u2019the day and it makes me wonder how these \u2018lucky winners\u2019 actually receive their prizes. Who in their right mind would disclose their home address to Weird Uncle Fiver for delivery of the prize? Maybe a covert handover under cover of darkness at a dimly-lit service station on the M25 or the parking garage of Fiver Towers instead?\u201d \u2013 Lars Gaertner. \u201cRe: yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters and Johnny Mac\u2019s shameless yet successful plea to be awarded letter o\u2019the day in order to secure a Christmas gift for his long-suffering father (who I\u2019m guessing would probably prefer the Tin in any case). Can I ask not to be considered for letter o\u2019the day? I think both me and my old man treasure the moment every Christmas when I tell him I was going to get him something, but just didn\u2019t get round to it, and he tells me it\u2019s the thought that counts, son. Christmas is all about tradition after all\u201d \u2013 Mick Ward. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport.

In the face of universal condemnation, the paper\u2019s director Ivan Zazzaroni parped: \u201cIf you don\u2019t understand it, it\u2019s because you can\u2019t do that.\u201d The Football League insists it has sufficient evidence to charge Sheffield Wednesday with misconduct over the sale of Hillsborough, after the Owls claimed the charges were \u201cunlawful\u201d. Macclesfield\u2019s players and staff say Saturday\u2019s League Two match against Crewe will not go ahead. \u201cThis is down to the fact that salaries have not been paid for last month,\u201d read a statement. \u201cWe have not trained as a squad since last Thursday due to the fact we have no training ground but, most importantly, the game can\u2019t go ahead for the emotional and mental wellbeing of the players which is currently rock bottom.\u201d Andros Townsend has revealed he lost \u00a346,000 in one night while struggling with a gambling addiction. Virgil van Dijk reckons the five changes J\u00fcrgen Klopp made to Liverpool\u2019s XI for the Merseyside derby shows the squad is deep enough to cope with the rigours of the title race. \u201cLook at Divock, Shaqiri, they did fantastic,\u201d he cheered. \u201cEveryone is contributing and we need everyone.
