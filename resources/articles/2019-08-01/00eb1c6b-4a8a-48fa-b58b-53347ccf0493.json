The organisation\u2019s public funding \u2013 for measures to reduce pollution flowing to the Great Barrier Reef \u2013 has been called into question after the group began promoting lectures by the controversial academic Peter Ridd, who argues farm run-off is not damaging the reef. The overwhelming scientific consensus, supported by governments and the foundation, is that water quality is one of the most significant threats to the health of the natural wonder. In April, the foundation awarded $1.4m to Canegrowers \u2013 one of the first grants issued under its $443m partnership with the federal government \u2013 to continue a program managed by external behavioural consultants called Cane Changer. Cane Changer is partly designed \u201cto improve recognition\u201d of growers \u201cfor their long history of environmental stewardship\u201d and the organisation has said the program will \u201cset the record straight\u201d. It also works with farmers to promote voluntary \u201cbest management practice\u201d measures. The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson has this week written to the foundation to question the award of the grant. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cHow is it that the foundation has given a grant to improve water run-off to an organisation that is now involved in a speaking tour questioning whether run-off matters?\u201d Whish-Wilson asked. \u201cI am writing to ask you what steps the foundation takes to ensure that the recipients of grants are not supporting or involved in activities that aim to discredit the scientific community or promote the denial of anthropogenic climate change. \u201cHas or will the foundation terminate this grant and take steps to recover funds already granted? \u201cIt is paramount that the foundation do everything it can, and be seen to be doing everything it can, to support the scientific community and defend the evidence regarding the impact of climate change and agricultural run-off on the reef.\u201d The foundation\u2019s managing director, Anna Marsden, said it funded \u201corganisations that contribute to \u2026 collective efforts to save the reef. \u201cFunds have been provided to Canegrowers to support on-ground work with cane farmers to encourage positive change and stewardship, with the goal of improving land management practices and ultimately reducing pollutants going to the reef,\u201d Marsden said. \u201cThe grant continues a successful project previously funded by the Queensland government. \u201cThe use of funds by Canegrowers is closely accounted for, with all funding required to be used solely for the ultimate purpose of improving the water quality of the reef.\u201d Canegrowers says its statewide organisation manages state and federal grant funding and \u201cremains committed to managing the impact of farming on the waterways that feed into the Great Barrier Reef\u201d. It says district branch companies have made individual decisions about promoting or supporting Ridd\u2019s controversial lectures. The speaking tour coincides with a likely vote in Queensland parliament this month on reef regulations, which would set pollution limits for sediment and chemical discharge from farms into the reef catchment. \u201cCanegrowers is very concerned that the provisions within the reef bill currently before the Queensland parliament will act as a disincentive to growers continuing with the excellent engagement they have given to water quality and farm practice improvement programs by implying that no matter what they do, it will never be enough and the goalposts will keep on shifting,\u201d the organisation said in a statement. \u201cThe campaign against the reef bill is against the ramping up of the existing regulations on cane farming, adding more bureaucracy with no clear benefit to growers or water quality.\u201d The state environment minister, Leeanne Enoch, defended the measures this week and said they were based on scientific advice. \u201cFor the last decade, the Queensland government has supported agricultural industries to voluntarily improve their practices. However, uptake has not been fast enough, so water quality has continued to decline.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
