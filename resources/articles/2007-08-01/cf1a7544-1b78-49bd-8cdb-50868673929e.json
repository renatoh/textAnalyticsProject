The Shergar Cup organisers have been somewhat wrong-footed by the presence of lightly weighted runners in the opening race and, as Turner is the rider who can do the lowest weight, she has been allocated Relative Order, set to carry just 7st12lb. \"We had no choice,\" said event manager Alistair Haggis. \"Hayley may put up a couple of pounds overweight, but it was the only thing to do with top jockeys involved. Martin Dwyer will ride Dalkey Girl, who has 8st3lb. Next year we will have a review of how the races are framed.\" Apart from the opening race, jockeys in the Shergar Cup were last night being allocated mounts by a predetermined formula designed to give the riders an even spread. \"Hayley will get first or second pick in later races,\" added Haggis. \"We are delighted to have her in the Cup again and she is thrilled. She rode very well last year, when she was beaten a short-head in the Mile.\" The British Horseracing Authority yesterday dismissed Seb Sanders' appeal, the jockey's first in his 17-year career, but returned his \u00a3500 deposit. Ron Cox's tip of the day Amalfi Coast 5.30 Sedgefield Moderate on the Flat, Amalfi Coast has shown a measure of ability in three runs over hurdles which suggests he may have got in lightly on his handicap debut here. Trained by Ronnie Barr, who has been in form with his Flat string lately, Amalfi Coast would not have been suited by the drop in distance when fifth over 2m1f here last time. He looks capable of better over this extra half-mile."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
