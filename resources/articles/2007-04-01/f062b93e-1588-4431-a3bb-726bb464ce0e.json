Prolonged drought has reduced Australia's rivers to a trickle, forcing many cities and towns to impose drastic water restrictions as reservoirs dry up. A contingency plan prepared for the government said that unless water catchments across the country received heavy and widespread rainfall before mid-May, allocations for irrigation would be stopped, presenting a threat to farmland in the critical food bowl of the Murray-Darling river basin. \"It is a grim situation and there is no point in pretending to Australia otherwise,\" said Mr Howard. \"We must all hope and pray there is rain,\" he told reporters at Parliament House in Canberra. \"If it doesn't rain in sufficient volume over the next six to eight weeks, there will be no water allocations for irrigation purposes in the basin [until May 2008].\" Parts of Australia have been in the grip of drought for a decade and the dry spell is expected to wipe up to 1% off the A$940bn (\u00a3391bn) economy in 2006-07. Australians could face big food price rises if no water is allocated to Murray-Darling basin farmers, irrigators warned. The drought has already severely reduced production of irrigated crops, including cotton lint, wine grapes and rice. Australia may not have a rice crop at all this season, Laurie Arthur, president of the Ricegrowers Association, told Reuters. \"If it stays dry, there will potentially be catastrophic losses,\" he said. Mr Howard said he did not want to talk in \"apocalyptic terms\" about whether towns would run out of water completely. \"The longer it goes on, the harder the impact. These are just stark facts,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
