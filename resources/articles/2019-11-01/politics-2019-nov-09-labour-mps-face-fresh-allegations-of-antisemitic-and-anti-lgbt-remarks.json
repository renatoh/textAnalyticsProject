Daniel Carden, the acting shadow international development secretary, is accused by BuzzFeed of singing an adapted version of the song while on a trip from the Cheltenham festival to London. Conor McGinn, a former Labour whip who is standing for re-election as MP for St Helens North, is reported by the website to have repeatedly called another colleague a \u201cpoof\u201d during the same journey on 15 March 2018. Carden, the Labour candidate for Liverpool Walton, denied the allegations, tweeting: \u201cThis was a coach full of journalists and MPs. If anyone genuinely believed any antisemitic behaviour had taken place, they would\u2019ve had a moral responsibility to report it immediately. \u201cYet this allegation is only made now when a general election is imminent. I stand by my record as an antiracist campaigner. I would never be part of any behaviour that undermines my commitment to fighting racism in all its forms.\u201d The allegations follow comments by the former home secretary and Labour peer David Blunkett\u2019s that antisemitism and \u201cthuggery\u201d within the party made him despair. Blunkett urged moderates to \u201cstay and fight\u201d to ensure the \u201cvoice of reason\u201d prevailed following Tom Watson\u2019s decision to stand down as deputy leader. A spokesman for Carden told BuzzFeed he would never intentionally engage in racist or antisemitic behaviour. The spokesman said: \u201cDaniel Carden has been a committed campaigner in support of LGBT rights and against all forms of racism and hatred, his entire political life. As a homosexual man he would never intentionally engage in homophobic, racist or antisemitic behaviour. Had there been genuine concerns as to Daniel\u2019s behaviour then those concerns should have been raised at the time rather than some 20 months later on the eve of a general election.\u201d A spokesperson for McGinn said: \u201cConor\u2019s record as a staunch supporter of the LGBT community speaks for itself. As an MP he led the campaign which delivered a monumental and historic change in the law to finally extend equal marriage to the whole of the UK.\u201d Mark Tami, who is standing for re-election in Alyn and Deeside, said: \u201cI was on the bus and didn\u2019t hear any singing of this nature.\u201d Another person from within Labour also told Sky News he was on the coach with Carden and did not hear those words being uttered. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, described the allegations as \u201cdisgusting\u201d. She tweeted: \u201cAt a time when the Jewish community feels under threat due to rising antisemitism, politicians have a duty to stand with them, not mock them.\u201d When asked about the allegations during his visit to Leeds, Jeremy Corbyn, said: \u201cDan Carden has emphatically denied that. It is an awful story and if it\u2019s true it is utterly and totally unacceptable. I am looking into it.\u201d Corbyn also responded to Blunkett\u2019s remarks. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that David Blunkett has chosen this time to say that,\u201d he said. \u201cI lead a party that is huge. It\u2019s half a million members. I lead a party that\u2019s very determined to tackle inequality, poverty and injustice in this country.\u201d The Labour leader was asked about a letter from female Labour MPs urging the national executive committee (NEC) to block Kate Osborne from becoming the party\u2019s candidate in Jarrow after she allegedly posted an image of Theresa May with a gun. Corbyn said: \u201cShe is going through a process. A panel will be conducted over the weekend to select a candidate for the Jarrow constituency and no doubt all those questions will be put to her as any question will be put to any of the candidates.\u201d Labour has faced fresh antisemitism claims this week after Gideon Bull, a parliamentary candidate, withdrew from standing in the general election following accusations he used the term \u201cShylock\u201d at a meeting where a Jewish councillor was present. He denied any intention to insult and has apologised for making the remark. Bull, a councillor from the London borough of Haringey, was intending to stand in the Essex seaside town of Clacton. Labour blocked the leftwing campaigner Chris Williamson from standing as a candidate in the general election after he was suspended over accusations he had downplayed antisemitism in the party. Williamson, the former MP for Derby North, was one of three Labour candidates told they would not be allowed stand following a day-long meeting of the party\u2019s ruling body. Zarah Sultana, a Labour general election candidate for Coventry South, apologised earlier this week for saying she would celebrate the deaths of world leaders including Tony Blair and Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. She said she had been \u201cexasperated by endless cycles of global suffering, violence and needless killing\u201d. Sultana also wrote of her support for \u201cviolent resistance\u201d by Palestinians in 2015, the Jewish Chronicle reported. She told the BBC the tweets were from a \u201cdeleted account dating back several years from when I was a student\u201d. \u201cI do not support violence and I should not have articulated my anger in the manner I did, for which I apologise,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
