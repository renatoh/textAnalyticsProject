Dyer's Burgers has been frying paper-thin burgers in the same seasoned grease recipe for 101 years \u2013 the grease is changed regularly, however. The patties are carefully scraped off a marble countertop, laid into an over-sized skillet of grease and pulled out just as they begin to float. Burgers are served as singles, doubles and triples, all with or without cheese, and garnished traditionally with a simple combination of mustard, pickles and onion. It's melted perfection on a burger bun. As Beale Street winds down late at night, that's when a Dyer's Double Double is truly at its best.
