Tony Cottee Former England player As far as midfield is concerned, the door is open for Owen Hargreaves and I think he'll be more than capable of filling that role.Cole will add something different on the left side, an unpredictability that opponents won't like.I'd fill the right-back slot with Sol Campbell:it's not his natural position but it would free up a central berth for big Martin Keown. Ron Atkinson TV pundit A 3-5-2 would give England more security and enable David Beckham to play in the centre of midfield.Nicky Butt would do the holding job, while Beckham and Paul Scholes control things.Owen Hargreaves can play right wing-back.People might say it's too late to change but don't forget we got to the semi-finals in 1990 after switching formation. Alan Green Commentator Radio 5 Live I think this is almost exactly the team Eriksson will choose for the Sweden game, although Mills could come in for Brown.I'm not sure that Mills is a good enough defender.He's had four suspensions this season so he's a risk, and if we could take a risk on him then why not on Graeme Le Saux, who is the best English left-back there is. Alec Stewart Surrey and England cricketer With Heskey and Owen up front you've got strength, pace and the Liverpool connection.I'd have had Le Saux in my team and otherwise I think this is almost exactly the team Eriksson will choose for the Sweden game, although Mills could come in for Brown.I'm not sure that Mills is a good enough defender.He's had four suspensions this season so he's a risk. James Brown Editor of Jack magazine It's basically the best English players who play for Leeds, and some others.Other than Woodgate and Bowyer, who should have been in the squad, I think Sven's done the best job he could, but I don't understand why he's overlooked Le Saux, who's played really well this year.Bowyer would be great for England - he scores goals in important games. Chris Waddle Former England player I would play a diamond in midfield with Beckham and Murphy tucking in on either flank, allowing Scholesy to play in the role that suits him best just behind the two strikers.The defence picks itself, with Wes Brown more than used to playing at right-back now that Gary Neville is unavailable.Teddy Sheringham would add a bit more guile off which Owen can feed. David Pleat Director of football at Spurs You would have to change the shape of the side, but you'd have to keep that strong defensive triangle of Seaman, Campbell and Ferdinand together.The two full-backs may be inexperienced, but they've got tremendous energy and, in Ashley Cole, terrific pace. Martin Keown would play a holding role in front of the back four and allow Beckham and Scholes to tuck in."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
