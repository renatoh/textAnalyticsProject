The Stop Sign!! by TISM \u2013 a metaphor for our collective mortality", "bodyText": "There can be no more difficult musical task than writing songs that successfully tell stories while also including gags that avoid landing with a loud clanging noise. And no Australian act has ever achieved this feat with the same strike rate as This Is Serious Mum (TISM). TISM formed in 1982, playing their charismatically named the Get Fucked Concert the following year. But it was their 1995 song Greg! The Stop Sign!! that first turned my then young head in their direction. It was one of those rare moments where after hearing one song, you know you\u2019ve got to seek out everything in the artist\u2019s back catalogue. A postmodern take on the Dead Man\u2019s Curve-style \u201cdeath song\u201d, Greg! The Stop Sign!! uses the tragic fate of a carload of fictional teenagers as a metaphor for our collective mortality via a tribute to a series of road safety ads. In our current, media-saturated environment, it\u2019s difficult to remember how shocking those ads were back then. In typical TISM fashion the accompanying video attempts to torpedo any hope of chart success by opening on the baffling sight of AFL players Shane Wakelin, Chris Hemley and Justin Peckett earnestly riding exercise bikes in St Kilda\u2019s Moorabbin Oval gymnasium while Josh Kitchen works the heavy bag. TISM were Sainters from way back, but how were those of us just coming on board supposed to know? All I saw was that for the first time Australian music was more than Daryl Braithwaite and his bloody Horses. It could also be thrillingly bizarre. During their career TISM obsessed over death at considerable length and in Greg!\u2019s lyrics \u201cwe get to do the driving, don\u2019t choose the direction we travel\u201d you find the song\u2019s key contention: that whether you\u2019re the most popular kid in school or the one who chooses to \u201cgraffiti the Dandenong line\u201d, death is inevitable. It was hardly going to be played at your local Blue Light disco, but at the same time you can\u2019t fault their logic. Who else could merge rock-solid philosophy with some of the greatest punchlines in Australian music history? Such timeless wisdom as: \u201cSometime in the next 10,000 years a comet\u2019s going to wipe out all trace of man / I\u2019m banking on it coming before my end-of-year exams\u201d spoke to me as a 14-year-old who would do anything to get out of going to school. It is a song that burns less successful attempts at humour off at the lights. Lyric like \u201cThe rich kid becomes a junkie, the poor kid an advertiser / What a tragic waste of potential (being a junkie\u2019s not so good either)\u201d would die a thousand deaths in the hands of the Offspring. One of TISM\u2019s most endearing features was their refusal to go all-out for world domination. Had they been offered the choice to write a risible hit like Offspring\u2019s Why Don\u2019t You Get A Job? or a song like The TISM Boat Hire Offer,with lyrics like \u201cBon Scott would be alive this week if he just went fishing from Mordialloc Creek\u201d, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d have chosen the latter, and if they\u2019re not richer for it, the world of music certainly is. It wasn\u2019t all jokes; in Greg! we\u2019re also treated to one of the all-time great skewerings of consumerism in eight lines so perfect that I expect to see them in Russell Brand\u2019s next revolutionary manifesto: Bought a car just the other day Man could that baby run! But you know what they always say There\u2019s always a better one Got a tumour in my brain It\u2019s creeping to my lungs And I\u2019ve searched around in vain Can\u2019t find me a better one. In a track that demands repeat listens to enjoy its subtleties, they are the lines that should be cut out and inducted into the Aria hall of fame. The point is that while he who dies with the most toys wins, we\u2019re all equal while six-foot under. A final furious monologue takes us home with the reminder that \u201cgrowing up\u2019s not a matter of choice, it\u2019s a matter of wait and see\u201d. And then the neatest balance of comedy and gruesome death ever written closes on the titular vehicular tragedy that is playing out in front of us: \u201cI thought I heard a semitrailer. Greg! You missed the stop sign!!\u201d This in a year where Australians were too busy flirting with Coolio to notice the song failed to chart (albeit entering the Triple J Hottest 100) \u2013 but that was this country\u2019s loss. Anonymity might have always suited TISM well, but there was no need to look to Los Angeles when all the best wisdom was coming from Melbourne\u2019s suburbs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
