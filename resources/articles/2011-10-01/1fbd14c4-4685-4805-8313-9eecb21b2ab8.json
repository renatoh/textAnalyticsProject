It's all about \"riding\" with your \"boo\" (getting in the car to go to Sainsbury's), \"all up in the store\" (stopping off in Superdrug) and \"grinding up on him\" (but wait 'til you're past the checkouts, Bey). Bruno Mars It Will Rain (Atlantic) It's the first single from the Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part One soundtrack and like, oh my god itz sooo deep. Bruno wants morphine if you walk away from him. IT WILL RAIN. Which (we think) is a metaphor for depression. \"I'll never be your mother's favourite/ Your daddy can't even look me in the eye,\" he sings, which is, of course, a lie, because everyone seems to love Bruno Mars. He could kick your TV in, shit on your cat and you'd still hear Amazing as the first dance at the next six weddings you go to. Cher Lloyd featuring Mike Posner With Ur Love (SyCo/Sony) Can we introduce you to a new Cher Lloyd? She's cute, she's sweet, she smiles and in the video she has two mates \u2013 and they're girls! Although someone may have told them she'll smell fear like a piranha smells blood. Even creepy voiced Mike Posner pops up in the \"necessary for the American market\" cameo at the end of the song to inform us he'll be touching Cher's tits sometime this week (\"First date/ First base/ Second date/ Second base\" \u2013 no thanks to a third date, Mike, unless you start washing your hands more often), but as this new Cher drums the hook into your head, you're left thinking: hang on? Did that annoying one off The X Factor just make one of the catchiest pop songs of 2011? The Ting Tings Hang It Up (Columbia) The most underused vocalist in a band since Lee from Steps, Jules (the boy) gets a chance to shout over guitars during Hang It Up. Good for you, Jules! It sounds like the Ting Tings had a nice long holiday listening to old Beastie Boys albums, realised they're due to release a song and shoved out Hang It Up. It's That's Not My Name, as if it were performed on The X Factor's Rock Week. Icona Pop Nights Like This (Mercury) Normally, a Casio keyboard on the \"accordion\" setting would be unwelcome in a pop song \u2013 thrown on the scrapheap along with the flute from Britney Spears's Criminal single and David Sneddon. But in Nights Like This, it cheerily skips along, making you think most songs need a bit thrown in. The Drugs Don't Work? Bit miserable. Get some keyboard in there. I Am The Resurrection? Put a donk on it with a Casio. Don't Look Back In Anger? Accordion remix! Indie guitar bands? Solved."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
