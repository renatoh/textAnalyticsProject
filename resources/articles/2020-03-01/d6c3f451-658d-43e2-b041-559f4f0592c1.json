Moon-faced and wide-eyed, she plays the Dickens hero as a lip-reading innocent. If Oliver lacks agency in the novel, he is even more adrift here where, without even BSL in his armoury, he has few means to express himself. But who needs speech when Melvin is so mesmerising? At large in a Victorian London made cruel by poverty, Oliver is at the heart of a politically astute adaptation. If you thought the crime, penury and violence of the novel were bad, imagine how much worse things would be if you were deaf at that time. In a production excellently directed by Amy Leach for Ramps on the Moon, a conglomerate of theatres committed to \u201cnormalising the presence of deaf and disabled people across the theatre industry\u201d, the colourful cast of characters are excluded twice over: once by poverty, once by disability. Bryony Lavery\u2019s adaptation incorporates this theme as skilfully as the production integrates signing and captioning. Forty years after the novel\u2019s publication, an educational conference in Milan declared signing was an inferior language and should be discouraged. In this version, Jack Lord\u2019s Brownlow is an early adopter of this exclusionary belief and duly dismissive of Oliver. All Melvin can do is blink back. The choreography of the ensemble\u2019s signing is as beautiful as the filmic surtitles, creating a celebration of community that contrasts with the story\u2019s dog-eat-dog individualism. The underworld characters have few redeeming features, yet the production\u2019s big-picture perspective never lets us think them entirely to blame in a society that criminalises people because of their poverty. Read my lips: it\u2019s a great show. \u2022 At Leeds Playhouse, until 21 March. Touring until 6 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
