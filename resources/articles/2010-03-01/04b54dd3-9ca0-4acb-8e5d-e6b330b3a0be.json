Portsmouth's manager had threatened to field a dummy side in protest at the decision to dock his club nine points for going into administration, but the Israeli relented and instead deployed a team who gave Hull an untimely demonstration of a quality first named by Dowie \u2013 completing a comeback with two goals in the dying minutes is surely the textbook definition of 'bouncebackability'. Dowie was not a popular appointment, but he was beginning to look an inspired one as Hull headed for their first away win in more than a year thanks to two goals from Caleb Folan, a player who had fallen out of favour under Phil Brown but, following injuries to Amr Zaki and Jozy Altidore, was recalled by Dowie to make his first appearance for the club since August. \"I had a feeling about Caleb,\" said Dowie. \"I thought he looked powerful in training, so I put him in and he responded in great fashion.\" Dowie, who holds a masters degree in engineering, did not radically restructure Hull, but his few alterations seemed set to succeed. As early as the fourth minute Kevin Kilbane, another player restored to the starting line-up, clipped a dainty cross to Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink, but the Dutchman's header bounced off a post. A defence featuring Paul McShane in the centre \u2013 Dowie's third change \u2013 restricted the hosts to shots from long distance, a fact that pleased the manager, who has made it plain that shoring up Hull's defence, the most porous in the league, is a prerequisite for survival. In the 27th minute, Dowie's mood was lifted even higher when a Jimmy Bullard corner was cleared to the edge of the area and Craig Fagan cracked a hopeful low shot goalwards. It skimmed through a slew of players and into the net via a slight touch from Folan. Then reality bit. Ten minutes later, Portsmouth equalised, as Hull failed to repel a Jamie O'Hara corner and Tommy Smith scuffed the ball over the line from close range. Midfield skirmishing characterised the remainder of the first period, as a lack of class was clear on both sides. Portsmouth improved in the second period and dominated possession, but Boaz Myhill was seldom troubled due to determined defending. In the 70th minute Dowie introduced Richard Garcia for Vennegoor of Hesselink and again the manager's move paid dividends, as three minutes later Garcia's pass split the home defence, leaving Folan to slot the ball past the out-rushing David James. Hull's wretched run on the road seemed over, but in the 88th minute the ball was rolled to O'Hara from a free-kick and he curled it into the net from 25 yards. Less than a minute later Hull fell behind, Nadir Belhadj hurtling down the left and crossing to the unmarked Kanu, who stabbed into the net from eight yards. \"When that happens, it feels like there's a big void opening up before you,\" said Dowie. \"But I saw enough spirit to be positive. Our shape was right and for long periods they didn't hurt us, but we didn't pass the ball well enough. But I've got to keep the players believing. We can take inspiration from Portsmouth.\" Grant agreed, and insisted the league's authorities should be grateful his players did not let their will to win be diluted by their disgust at the deduction. \"We're doing a great favour to the Premier League,\" he said. \"If we had played like others expect us, with the head down, the fans would turn off and that would be bad for the league. But despite the wrong decision against us, we decided to play until the end in the spirit of the game.\" THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT GLENN DUGGAN, Observer reader Portsmouth fans are always perplexed about Avram Grant's selections. We always knew Kanu would torment Hull, but he was left on the bench. And Basinas is quality on the ball but he was also warming his backside. We deserved to win. They were lucky with their goals; their second one deflected off the ref and went to a Hull player who scored. The ref just shrugged his shoulders. When we went 2-1 down, Grant changed it to a 4-3-3. Mokoena going off is a great sight for us because it means Kanu or Basinas is coming on. What this team has done is remarkable. The fans enjoy them. The fan's player ratings James 5; Mullins 6, Rocha 6 (Basinas 84 n/a), Hreidarsson 6, Belhadj 7; Wilson 8, Mokoena 4 (Kanu 57 7); Owusu-Abeyie 3(Webber 82 n/a), O'Hara 8, Smith 7; Piquionne 6 BILL DAVIES, Observer reader Totally gutted. We were doing OK at 85 minutes. We scored twice, which we don't often do, and almost all our players did well; they seemed to be really up for the fight \u2013 eager to please the new manager. But Dowie's decision to play Kilbane in midfield backfired. He's really slow and not much use these days. I blame Phil Brown. It's because of his efforts that our players show such a lack of confidence away from home. Marney was decent, Caleb \"Offside\" Folan did all right but his attitude is poor, always flapping around. On a positive note, things can only get better for Dowie \u2013 I hope. The fan's player ratings Myhill 5; Mendy 4, Mouyokolo 7, McShane 4, Dawson 4 (Garcia 70 4); Fagan 7, Kilbane 2, Bullard 5, Marney 4; Folan 7, Vennegoor of Hesselink 5 (Barmby 66 5) TO TAKE PART IN THE FANS' VERDICT, SPORT@OBSERVER.CO.UK"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
