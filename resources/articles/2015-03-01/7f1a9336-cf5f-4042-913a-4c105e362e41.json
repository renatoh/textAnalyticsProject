We need our own news to stay informed", "bodyText": "Angela Davis, the inspirational black American activist once said \u201cIf they come for me tonight, they\u2019ll come for you in the morning.\u201d Those words were ringing in my ears after the revelation that SBS Television is planning to axe the National Indigenous Television\u2019s landmark nightly national news service. Like all communities in Australia, news is not just important to Aboriginal people. For reasons that should be obvious, an Aboriginal person, by force of national interest, is also an activist. Our rights are not respected in this country, and so we must stay informed not just about the nation, but most crucially about our own mob. That\u2019s why NITV national news is so important. Put simply, there is no other service like it. It tells our stories in a language and perspective that we understand. The proposal by SBS to replace the nightly news with a panel discussion show a couple of days a week \u2013 a \u201crepackaging of news\u201d as they call it \u2013 is an outrage. It will not service the needs of my community. What SBS is doing is silencing our voices, a modern-day version of the banning of our languages on missions, when our people were forced to speak English under threat of punishment. That\u2019s always been one of the most commonly used tools of colonisation \u2013 to deny us a voice. Without one, we lack information, the main currency of today\u2019s power. NITV national news plays a pivotal role in delivering that information and without it, our communities are poorer and less powerful. I have great admiration for people like Stan Grant and Karla Grant, two stalwarts of Aboriginal news programming. I would hope that they don\u2019t stand idly by and allow their employer to get away with this. Equally, I would hope that they don\u2019t allow the spin from SBS to stifle debate on such an important issue. Claims by SBS that they\u2019re simply trying to repackage Aboriginal news to improve ratings, and respond to audience feedback, are demonstrably false. SBS has no idea how its audience consumes NITV, because that research does not exist. Managing director Michael Ebeid conceded as much to media website Mumbrella in November last year, acknowledging that research was difficult to conduct on Aboriginal viewership \u2013 for example no ratings boxes exist in the Northern Territory, a crucial part of the NITV demographic. Equally, where are the ratings boxes in Aboriginal homes in Brisbane, Redfern, Melbourne and country areas? I don\u2019t know a single black family with one \u2013 does Ebeid? What he and his spinners are actually saying is that non-Aboriginal people \u2013 the only demographic they can monitor \u2013 appear not to be consuming Aboriginal news. So what? New Matilda journalist Amy McQuire reported that, in February, Ebeid told staff: Do I think we should be wedded to a half hour news bulletin that looks and smells and sounds like every other news bulletin. No. I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s necessarily important. What\u2019s interesting about this statement is the SBS\u2019s news programming across every other community \u2013 from its mainstream news, to Chinese, Greek and Turkish news \u2013 looks and sound like every other news service. There\u2019s a simple reason for that \u2013 a nightly news format works, and draws in viewers. Why does Ebeid think that the consumption patterns of Aboriginal people are any different? Again, where is his evidence? In November last year, he also told Mumbrella that NITV\u2019s operations were \u201cnot about chasing numbers and ratings\u201d. What has changed? As a lifetime activist for black rights, I understand the importance of being informed, and staying connected with our mob. I also understand the importance of media, which is why, a few decades ago, I served on the SBS Indigenous advisory board, when Sir Nick Shehadie was chair of the organisation. At the same time, I worked on Icam, an SBS Indigenous current affairs programme which grew to become Living Black, an important source of news and inspiration for our people. I\u2019m reminded that when I first got involved with the Indigenous Cultural Affairs Magazine programme on SBS, Icam, it was directly funded by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander commission. SBS weren\u2019t motivated enough to service the needs of the Aboriginal community off their own bat, they needed a sweetener from government to provide Aboriginal specific programming. SBS also receives a substantial amount of funding to host NITV \u2013 more than $12m a year from the Australian government. And people say the Aboriginal community is always waiting for a hand out! Where is this money going? How is it than an experienced broadcaster of news can\u2019t produce a nightly news service with access to this level of government assistance? SBS has been a part of the \u201cAboriginal industry\u201d for a long, long time. It\u2019s high time they started giving something back. I hope that the decision by SBS to axe the nightly NITV national news programme is met with outrage by the Aboriginal community. It is an enormous betrayal of my people by an organisation that has long held a special relationship with my community, and a position of trust. I urge the SBS board to reconsider. I also urge all Australians \u2013 in particular migrant communities who are well serviced by SBS - to let their views be known. You might not rely on NITV national news like my mob does, but if you sit idly by and watch SBS diminish the Aboriginal voice \u2013 the First Voice of this nation \u2013 then you shouldn\u2019t be surprised if one day they diminish yours as well."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
