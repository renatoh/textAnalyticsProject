And so it must be for our chancellor, George Gideon Osborne, who has had a rough time since that pension-raiding budget. He's feeling bruised about it even now, according to insiders quoted in the weekend papers. It can't help that the likes of our own Steve Bell will mock and mock, with those horrible cartoons depicting the chancellor in a gimp suit, or with nose grotesquely drawn to look like a posterior. And it can't help to know that when Bell depicted a vile and bloated Osborne, covered in rolls of fat, stark naked save for socks and boots with only a magician's hat to cover his modesty, the cartoon was snapped up by the chancellor's mother, Lady Felicity. She can see his flaws, like everyone else. \u2022 For he's a transparent kind of guy. There's George, sitting pretty at No 6 in the latest cabinet rich list compiled by renowned wealth researchers Wealth-X. Inheritor of a fortune worth \u00a34.5m. But then the richest member of the cabinet, Lord Strathclyde, has \u00a39.5m. And then there's Andrew Mitchell, the international development minister, accorded \u00a32.2m. So all income levels are represented. \u2022 At long last we heard from Tony Blair about his relationship with Rupert Murdoch. And characteristically, after a day of interrogation at the Leveson inquiry, he left us none the wiser. If he didn't make any deals, offer any favours, beg any favours or feel any obligation towards Murdoch, why was he so willing to cosy up to the media magnate? Was he just an upmarket groupie? Surely not. But there was something. This weekend, writing in the Sunday Times and reviewing Ian Robertson's new book The Winner Effect: How Power Affects Your Brain, Dominic Lawson shares the Foreign Office assessment of Blair's tendency to gravitate towards the brightest light. \"He's the girl who wants to be at the best dances,\" observed one mandarin. Couldn't help himself. And no one threw a better party than Rupert. \u2022 A misfortune of being abroad for in past days was that the Diary missed the conference of the Association of Chief Police Officers in Manchester. Always a repository of progressive thinking. And usually a chance to meet some of the big beasts in policing. Such as Adrian Lee, the chief constable of Northamptonshire, who chaired the debate \"An ethical police force \u2013 a non-negotiable requirement\". He's the expert: Acpo's lead on ethics and policing. He is also one of four senior officers facing investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission over allegations of misconduct, arising from a murder inquiry during their service in Staffordshire. Still, like any other citizen he is innocent until judged otherwise. Thus he was, Acpo tells us, just the man to lead the discussions. Anyone sniggering should look at themselves. \u2022 Meanwhile, as communities the length and breadth prepare for jubilee parties at the weekend, one wonders if any leading media will have the nerve to oppose the entire jamboree. Seems unlikely. But it wasn't like that the last time, for then there was Reynold's \u2013 the bestselling, robustly republican Sunday paper, which took a dim view of the jollity surrounding Victoria's diamond jubilee in 1897. It reprinted, in full, an anarchist leaflet describing Victoria as a \"fat old lady\", and gave readers the theological dimension as conveyed by a like-minded vicar in Durham. He said the existence of the royal family was delaying the arrival of the kingdom of heaven. \u2022 Finally, unkind it was of Stephen Moss, who served here with such distinction for two weeks past, to let the cat out of the bag on Friday re the Diary's rebranding exercise. These things require discretion. Our plan to reappear as Hibu (High-Boo) has already been leaked and stolen by Yellow Pages. Everywhere, betrayal. So it's back to the drawing board, not least because the best alternative title we now have is Sladder \u2013 which apparently means gossip in Norwegian. Until some bright-spark reader does better \u2013 collecting as reward perhaps, a bottle of champagne \u2013 the title stays the same.
