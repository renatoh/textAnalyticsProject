It's not a wide gap but it's plenty deep, and those on opposite sides of the chasm still, 28 years later, stare across it at each other in profound mutual bewilderment. I was 14 in 1977, too young for sex and drugs and all of life's impending bounty, but already too old, too sceptical, too horny and hormonal for light-sabre fights (which were called \"sword fights\" back when I was a stupid kid) or for mooning over Carrie Fisher's square-looking intergalactic Annette Funicello, a goddess-in-the-making for the still pubeless geeks coming up behind me. I was already reading dirty books and foreign ones. I'd already seen beheadings and examples of violent overkill in movies and, I confess, they kinda turned me on. Punk was in the air - an incitement to behavioural excess that proved hard to shake as the years advanced - and girls were in the offing. What did I want with Chewy and Han Solo? I could only identify with the weirdos in the space cantina - another foretaste of things to come. But the gap is defined by more general phenomena than mere personal experience or taste. If you're about my age, you were among the last people to reach maturity in the pre-digital age. We did our maths O-level with a slide-rule; the next year had calculators. Kids younger than us would become familiar with computers in school and with computer games at home. We thought Pong and Pac-Man were for suburban dumbasses and pub drunks. We grew up at the tail-end of Butskellism and the gridlocked, grey-shaded age of consensus; the next generation grew up amid the monochrome platitudes of Reagan and Thatcher who claimed that, yes, everything was exactly this simple and black-and-white. And none of us registered Star Wars as a seismic event. And more fool us, I suppose, because if our generations had a beef over Star Wars, then my team lost and the war was won by the idolators of George Lucas - whose profound conservatism was already evident in American Graffiti. Star Wars was tailor-made for Reagan's bumpkin certainties and cowboy worldview: \"Star Wars Missile Defence\", \"The Evil Empire\" - two phrases by which the gipper and the geek will forever be linked. Four decades after young Americans went to a meaningless war with heads full of John Wayne anti-commie bullshit, we're now sending kids who were raised with Lucas's new creation myths to Iraq, albeit with unbattle-worthy light-sabres. Lucas is only a symptom of all this idiocy, but a highly potent one, as his myths - not Shane or High Noon or The Searchers - are now definitively the nation's. We have long since gone over to the Dark Side. And don't get me started on how Star Wars killed 1970s cinema. If only he'd never made it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
