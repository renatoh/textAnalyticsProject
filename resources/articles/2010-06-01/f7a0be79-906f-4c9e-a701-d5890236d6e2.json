Neil Jacques, 52, said Bird had paced up and down on the night before the murders, repeatedly saying that a Revenue and Customs investigation into his finances would land him in jail. \"I told him to get his head together because he wasn't thinking straight,\" said Jacques. The disclosure came as police revealed that they had tried to call Bird, 52, on his mobile telephone as he sought out family members, rivals and strangers in the winding lanes of Cumbria. Bird did not respond. In another day of dramatic developments as police attempt to piece together a possible motive for the Cumbrian massacre, detectives also revealed that: \u25a0 The body of Bird's twin brother David, his first victim, was found in his bedroom and there was no signs of a forced entry, indicating that Bird was either allowed in or that he had his own key. \u25a0 A third licensed firearm, another shotgun, has been seized from Bird's home, but no suicide note has been found. \u25a0 Bird's mother Mary, 90, who is suffering from ill health, has been told one of her twin sons has murdered the other. As detectives attempt to gain more understanding of the events that pushed Bird over the edge, officers began scanning paperwork and computer hard drives taken from Bird's home in the village of Rowrah. Earlier, Cumbria police confirmed that Bird was the subject of an investigation by the taxman. Intrigue still surrounds a mysterious \u00a360,000 that Bird told a friend he had in his account. The killer also admitted to fellow taxi driver Mark Cooper that he feared going to jail over the issue. It has also emerged that the will made by Bird's father, Joe, revealed that his brother David had received a \u00a325,000 payout but that the killer had been ignored. Police are understood to have questioned members of Bird's family as they try to ascertain what may have prompted the shootings. Among them is his 47-year-old ex-partner, Linda Mills, the mother of Bird's two sons, Graeme and Jamie. Mills left Bird and moved to the Cumbrian village of Lamplugh with Graeme in early 1994, around the time she gave birth to Jamie, now 16. Less than a fortnight ago, Bird became a grandfather for the first time after Graeme, 28, had a boy called Leighton. Meanwhile, close friend and neighbour Jacques has shed light on Bird's emotional state on the night before the killing began. Bird left Jacques's home at 12.30am on Wednesday after spending six hours with him, saying that he would be going to a meeting with his solicitor, Kevin Commons. Neither man had been drinking alcohol, it is claimed. A post-mortem examination will be carried out to establish whether Bird was under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the shootings. \"I wished him good luck in the meeting. He mumbled something and walked out,\" Jacques said. A few hours later, Bird murdered David before seeking out and killing Commons. Police believe Bird deliberately targeted some of his victims and indiscriminately shot at others during his 45-mile rampage, and are pursuing a number of theories relating to motive. The senior investigating officer, Superintendent Iain Goulding, said: \"Detectives are working to verify suggestions that Bird was involved in personal disputes with fellow taxi drivers, or others. We have also been reviewing his finances and investigating issues of taxation. \"While we continue to investigate these issues, we may never fully understand what could have driven Bird to commit such atrocities.\" Elsewhere, the Observer has learned that police and doctors have \"agreed\" a pioneering system whereby doctors are notified of patients who own firearms. The system is designed to provide police with an early warning system should doctors conclude that a gun owner's mental health is deteriorating. The British Medical Association (BMA) and the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) held several meetings last year discussing whether GPs could place tags on medical records indicating whether a patient held a gun licence or had applied for one. Although doctors have been cautious about becoming involved in firearm licensing procedures, a source at Acpo said yesterday that an \"information sharing\" system had been agreed, though details of its implementation have yet to be revealed. A spokesman for the BMA said: \"Updated ethical guidance from the BMA reflects our view that such a system can be appropriate, provided it is used as part of the ordinary care given to a patient. It can, for example, be a useful aide-memoire to remind doctors that the patient has, or may have, access to a firearm.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
