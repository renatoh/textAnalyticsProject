A third of those aged 16 and over who left care did so before their 18th birthday, contrary to the government\u2019s expectation, according to a report by the National Audit Office (NAO) released on Friday. It concludes that services have deteriorated for seven consecutive years. Cuts and poor management from central and local government have resulted in many young people leaving care early, it finds. They often struggle to cope with the transition to adulthood and many experience social exclusion, unemployment and health problems or end up in custody, the report notes. Only eight of 151 councils in England know where young people who have left their care are living. It is understood that councils with poor services for care leavers include Rochdale, Birmingham, Devon and Somerset. In an unusually strong statement, Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said stronger central and local leadership is urgently required to \u201cget a grip of the problem\u201d. He said: \u201cThe cost of [young people] not moving into adulthood successfully is high. The government has made a commitment to improve the support for these young people, but the outcomes for many have been deteriorating over the past seven years.\u201d Care leavers shared harrowing stories of neglect with auditors. One said the struggle to cope after leaving care had defined their unhappiness for many years. They said: \u201cThere\u2019s been all these fractured parts of myself that I have had to reconnect with ... but if that had happened when I was leaving care at 18, perhaps I\u2019d have had a chance then to have had a family, a relationship.\u201d Cuts in local mental health services have also affected care leavers disproportionately, the report finds. It highlights the testimony of one person, whose risk of self-harm was overlooked by a social worker. The interviewee said: \u201cI was telling my social worker time and time again like, I\u2019m not okay \u2026 and she was just kind of like ... oh \u2026 you\u2019ve been to CAMHS [Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services]. Things got so bad, I ended up in A&amp;E.\u201d Every year, about 10,000 16- to 18-year-olds leave foster or residential care in England. Children in care must leave local authority care by their 18th birthday, but should be given support until they are 21. The Department for Education sets the overall framework of support for care leavers but most services come from local authorities. The report finds that in 2013/14, 10,310 young people aged 16 and over left care in England \u2013 a 50% increase in a decade. Of those, a third were under 18 and many were highly vulnerable. In 2013-14, 41% of 19-year-old care leavers were not in education, employment or training, compared with only 15% of their age peers. Auditors concluded that that the cost of not moving into adulthood successfully is likely to be high to care leavers and the public. Local authorities spent \u00a36,250 on average for each care leaver in 2013-14, ranging from an estimated \u00a3300 to \u00a320,000. But auditors found little correlation between local authorities\u2019 reported spending and the quantity and quality of their services. Efforts to improve the situation are being hampered by a lack of reliable data about how the lives of care leavers developed over time, the report adds. Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, said it appeared that some local authorities were \u201cturning their back\u201d on care leavers. She said: \u201cMany young people in care have had difficult lives and face challenging social problems on leaving care. The least these young people should expect after receiving local authority care is to feel supported as they start living independently.\u201d A Department for Education spokesperson said the government has introduced a comprehensive series of reforms to help care leavers, including changing the law so young people can live with their foster family after they turn 18. The spokesperson said: \u201cWe are also investing more than \u00a3100m through the innovation programme to support vulnerable children, and funding programmes to get more care leavers into apprenticeships.\u201d Separately, the NAO has refused to sign off the Department for Work and Pensions accounts because of an \u201cunacceptably high level of fraud and error\u201d in welfare payments. While overpayments were down from 2% the previous year, this was \u201cnot a statistically significant change\u201d, an NAO spokesman said. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 July 2015 to clarify that the government expects children to remain in care until they are 18 rather than imposing a legal obligation that they do so."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
