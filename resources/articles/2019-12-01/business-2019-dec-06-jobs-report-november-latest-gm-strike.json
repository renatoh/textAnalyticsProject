Economists had expected job growth to 187,000 in November, up from 128,000 in October and boosted by the return to work of 48,000 GM workers following a 40-day strike. Manufacturing employment rose by 54,000 in November, following a decline of 43,000 in the prior month. Healthcare added 45,000 jobs. The impressive headline growth rate was compounded by upward revisions for earlier months. The labor department revised October\u2019s jobs growth to 156,000, up from 128,000 originally and September\u2019s was revised up to 193,000 from 180,000. There had been some fears that the US\u2019s record streak of jobs growth was coming to an end. Friday\u2019s report follows a lackluster survey of private sector hiring. On Wednesday ADP, the US\u2019s largest payroll provider, said the US has added just 67,000 new jobs in November. Economists had been expecting a number closer to 156,000. Some 6000 jobs were lost in both Manufacturing and construction. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, said the job market was \u201closing its shine\u201d. \u201cManufacturers, commodity producers, and retailers are shedding jobs. Job openings are declining and if job growth slows any further unemployment will increase,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
