Yes, it is a bit 1960s office blockish from the outside. The ground floor used to be a men's clothing shop and the two floors above that are still IBM offices. The 175-room hotel consists of the converted ground floor with lifts that whisk you up to the six floors which have been built on top of IBM as the hotel. The Nordic Light's cheaper sister hotel the 367-room Nordic Sea opposite is a converted police headquarters. And why the funny name? The big attraction of the Nordic Light is, er, the lighting. Interiors are minimalist (not bare) thanks to the talents of 'lighting architect' Kai Piippo who decides each month where the subtle, spiky illumination goes according to season and amount of light outside - remember there's only three or four hours a day in winter. With Midsummer this week (longest day on 22 June when it hardly darkens at all), they won't be needing much artificial stuff. The hotel is cosier than your standard minimalist hotel such as St Martin's Lane or the Hempel in London, probably because of the clever lighting. What are the rooms like? Bare wooden floors, a black, white and grey colour scheme with splashes of red for the curtains. Really comfortable mattresses, very limited choice of English-speaking channels on TV. Lots of angular furniture. But the best thing about the Nordic Light and sister hotels is the choice of rooms. It's a bit like choosing clothes - they have singles not much bigger than ship cabins (ask for XS), rising through S, M, L and XL. And the food? Scandinavian buffet breakfast is included in the price - a table laden with pickled herrings, freshly baked breads and salads if you like that type of thing as well as sliced hams, cheeses and mini tubes of caviar. It's on the ground floor next to huge windows - none of this stuffing the breakfast room in the dark basement, a particular pet hate of mine. The room-service food (or rather the dish I chose) was appalling. Chilli con carne consisted of a huge pile of fatty, dryish mince without a kidney bean in sight! The problem with a lot of these cool hotels is that the service is ice cold. Not here, though. The staff are really friendly - no 'you're not trendy enough to be here' dirty looks or bouncers on the door and they don't have a problem with practicalities such as cots or pushchairs. Any other special features? Across the road in the Nordic Sea is a new vodka Ice Bar - where everything from the counter and walls to the glasses are made of ice. It's so cold in there (minus six degrees) management supplies boozers with fur-frilled anoraks and matching silver mittens. \u00b7 The Nordic Light Hotel, Vasaplan, Stockholm, Sweden (00 46 8 50 56 30 00).
