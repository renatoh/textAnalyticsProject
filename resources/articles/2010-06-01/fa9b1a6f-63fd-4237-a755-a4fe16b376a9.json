The squad is now older, slower and dependent on barely fit players. The group is tough, and coach Pim Verbeek is more journeyman than miracle worker. I can't see us going beyond the group stage, but the national competitive character is intact, so who knows? The players will relish the challenge of Germany, be relatively unafraid of Serbia, but probably lack surety against Ghana. Men to watch: Mark Schwarzer and Tim Cahill: Cahill is the only Australian capable of providing the X-factor. Weakest link: The midfield engine of Marco Bresciano, Vince Grella and Jason Culina, which delighted in 2006, is running on fewer revs now. There are big problems at the back, and, up front, beanpole J-leaguer Josh Kennedy is a one-trick pony. But the biggest joke is headless chook Brett Holman. He's all about reckless speed and vigour at the expense of touch, elan, passing, movement or finishing. Him making the squad ahead of playmakers like former Crystal Palace midfielder Nicky Carle has eaten up terabytes in Aussie blogs. The coach: Verbeek stubbornly maintains a stultifying 4-5-1 \u2013 fatally one-dimensional against better teams. Best chant: Desperately trying to get away from the brain-gnashing \"Aussie Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi Oi!\" Least-liked opponents: USA and New Zealand's Rory Fallon: a big mouth and a big chip on his shoulder. TIPS Winner: Spain: way above the rest. Golden boot: Lionel Messi (Argentina). England: Semi-finals. Close but no cigar. A strong team and for once a manager seemingly devoid of self-destructive tendencies. Egos relatively intact, they might even win a shoot-out this time around.
