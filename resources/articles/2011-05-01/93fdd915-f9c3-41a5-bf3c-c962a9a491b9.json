We try to quieten those who would sully this momentous event. But they will not listen. Such a coup, they say, to elevate the man credited with co-authorship (with the late Sir Keith Joseph) of a masterwork attacking the notion of equality. Hats off. Never mind his failed attempt, acting for the last government, to suppress information in the Binyam Mohamed torture case. And when will the cleverest man in Britain take up his new position? Not for a while. First he is expected to conclude his very lucrative star turn as brief for Roman Abramovich in the tycoon's legal battle with the oligarch Boris Berezovsky. It doesn't even start until October and is set down for at least 12 weeks. The Lawyer magazine reckons Sumption's fee hovers around the \u00a33m mark; little wonder that he's keen to get the job done. Still, he'll be a fine new addition to the court of courts, so it's definitely worth the wait. \u2022 Just three weeks ago we outlined the natural order of things. Britain's Got Talent has the Hoff, we said. And at the Daily Telegraph, they have the Heff. But now they don't have the Heff, for yesterday the venerable Simon Heffer \u2013 columnist, upholder of tradition, chief constable of Her Majesty's grammar police \u2013 departed, \"by mutual consent\", to pursue interests academic. Free to purge the next generation of any radical tendencies they may exhibit. Free to ensure they accord the correct titles to all members of the aristocracy. Much sadness at Telegraph HQ but little surprise, for many wondered how long Heffer could survive, given his uneasy fit with the current regime and his implacable hatred of all things Cameroonian. It's \"The Telegraph's anniversary gift to David Cameron: Simon Heffer has written his last column for the newspaper,\" tweeted the man from ConservativeHome. They will not see his like again. At least, that's the hope. \u2022 And as the military steps up its effort to level Tripoli and to \"engage with\", that is level, Col Gaddafi himself, interesting to know how his unlovely regime was regarded before levelling became a necessity. Those eager to know more about the Col and our previous relationship with his administration have been flocking to buy Seeking Gaddafi, a book of inquiry and personal reflections published last year by the Tory MP for Shrewsbury and Atcham, Daniel Kawczynski, chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on Libya. Some of what they read seems quite surprising. Saif Gaddafi emerged as the best frontman for his father's brutal resistance. Kawczynski, however, saw him as one who had \"carved out a public role for himself as a reformer, with the desire to work for progressive change in both politics and economics\". Hmm. Still, Kawczynski was always for engagement. \"There is money to be made,\" he said, and \"Britain is well placed to benefit from Libya's revival.\" There are ethical issues, for sure. \"But what is the alternative? Removing ourselves from Libya means that we lose our chance to be part of rebuilding the economy of a really important oil producing state.\" And of the greatest potential? Construction. With bombs raining down, that must be right. \u2022 Here we are, meanwhile, blessed with a coalition moulded in the national interest. But the glue's pretty watery; of that there is no doubt. What was that Big Dave said at Prime Minister's Questions yesterday? There's only one party you can trust on the NHS,\" he said. \"And it's the one I lead.\" Chew on that, Lib Dems. \u2022 Finally, the hunt is on. Who was the boorish MP, said to be a Tory, who apparently rounded on Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, and a guest, in a lift at the House of Commons? Refused to believe that she was an MP and not a mere slip of a girl. He \"came storming in and said neither of us could read as it was a lift for wheelchair users &amp; MPs only\", tweeted Creasy afterwards. \"He just started ranting.\" Arrogant, childish, aggressive, muddle-headed. How to whittle down the list of suspects?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
