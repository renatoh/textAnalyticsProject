He is also, he says, inspired by a self-imposed obligation to the people of the Easterhouse housing estate in Glasgow, who once jibed that as soon as he drove away he would forget his now legendary visit. Instead, it is the sense of the injustice of their lives that lies behind his determination to transform the benefit system. He has taken on the biggest non-economic political challenge today, the more difficult because it is undertaken against a background of scepticism. Is this reform, or just another way of cutting? If Mr Duncan Smith needed reminding of the perils of reform and benefits when uttered in the same breath, they were all about him yesterday as the prime minister scrambled to recover the position on withdrawing child benefit for higher rate taxpayers without seeming to backtrack in the face of overwhelming criticism. But just because reform of the welfare system is a politically fraught and technically difficult project does not mean it cannot be made to work. It deserves to succeed, for a simpler, more transparent system could genuinely transform lives. At the heart of Mr Duncan Smith's proposals is what he calls a universal credit that will replace all the separate elements of the current system \u2013 from jobseeker's allowance and income support to housing benefit. It is a familiar concept to a generation of welfare reformers who have grown old struggling to end the poverty trap, in which taking a job leads to such a steep drop in benefit income that the claimant is left worse off. But finding a single solution to balance the variables of moving out of unemployment and into work is a complex task. Gordon Brown's tax credits, introduced in 1998, were the most effective response so far to the problem, but they brought a whole new type of complication to the tottering structure of benefits. A succession of name changes and a rotating-door policy for secretaries of state (11 in 13 years) added to the sense of a system living on borrowed time. This sense prompted both James Purnell and his successor, Yvette Cooper, to examine possible reforms. The first challenge is untangling the detail of a system whose complexities are not the result of political whimsy but of the reality of the way people live. It is a political certainty that there will be losers, and equally certain that the winners will not be easily found. The cap on housing benefit is already one hostage to fortune, and replacing the system of direct rental payments is another. Temporary work, part-time workers and self-employment will all pose specific problems. Devising a system that can also embrace the needs of the long-term sick, the disabled and their carers will be even tougher. The technical difficulties are daunting, but with determination they can be resolved, at least as long as Mr Duncan Smith is allowed to continue to focus on the job. The political difficulties are another thing altogether. From 2013, when the first switch-over is scheduled, the Treasury has to be persuaded to finance, in effect, two welfare systems at the same time. The drive to use reform to make cuts might be irresistible, but it would jeopardise the project. In particular, it might make it impossible to achieve or sustain the cross-party support that is indispensable to its success, for this is a two-parliament task that demands a measure of time and patience. Understandably, the opposition is nervous of the underlying philosophy of a government that has already made tax credits less generous and capped housing benefit. And the greatest challenge of all is the recession. For every job vacancy, there are five jobless. It relies on economic recovery that is far from certain. Yesterday IDS promised to make welfare more fair. He was talking about the balance between taxpayers and claimants. But those who cannot work are also owed fairness, and sometimes it has to be uncoupled from the taxpayer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
