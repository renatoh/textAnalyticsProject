Tony\u2019s Chocolonely is a big noise here because this is where its business all started and where its HQ is based. Like many responsible chocolate manufacturers, it aims to make its chocolate slave-free. There are flavours available that you can\u2019t get in the UK yet and I spend some time on a translation app trying to work out what is what. Later that day I head to Puccini Bomboni, where the chocolates (\u2018our chocolates are seen more as dessert\u2019) are massive and gorgeous and sold by the gram. The gianduja alone is palm-sized. I want to buy an assortment, but seeing the man in front of me spend \u20ac60 on what is scarcely 16 pieces, I settle on just one: a walnut square, thick with nutty ganache and crowned in chocolate curls. Puccini\u2019s walls are lined with boxes of prepacked chocolate products and there are mini flakes (\u2018bark\u2019) in higher cocoa-content chocolate - something I\u2019ve never before found on my travels. I buy a box, which, once tasted, has to be replenished. Before you hate me: Puccini ships abroad. Walking home we spy a 300m queue outside a tiny shop: Van Stapele. It sells only one product: a Valrhona dark chocolate cookie with a white chocolate heart. Supplies are rationed to no more than seven per customer and they make only 3,000 a day: when they sell out they shut. There is a charming \u2018minder\u2019 on the door. We promise to try one if the queue ever shortens. On the last day, it does. We buy one and then immediately return for a glorious box of six."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
