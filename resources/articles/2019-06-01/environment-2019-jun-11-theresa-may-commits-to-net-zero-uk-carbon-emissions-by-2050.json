The commitment, to be made in an amendment to the Climate Change Act laid in parliament on Wednesday, would make the UK the first member of the G7 group of industrialised nations to legislate for net zero emissions, Downing Street said. Environmental groups welcomed the goal but expressed disappointment that the plan would allow the UK to achieve it in part through international carbon credits, something Greenpeace said would \u201cshift the burden to developing nations\u201d. Last week No 10 dismissed claims from the chancellor, Philip Hammond, that such a target would cost \u00a31tn and could thus require spending cuts to public services. With May departing as prime minister next month, as soon as her successor is chosen, she has stepped up efforts on policy areas sidelined by Brexit, including new spending commitments, efforts to tackle modern slavery and the environment. The 2050 target, in an amendment being put down as a statutory instrument, meaning it does not require a vote of MPs, will be one of the most ambitious such goals set by a major polluting nation. France proposed net zero emissions legislation this year, while some smaller countries have gone for dates before 2050, such as Finland (2035) and Norway (2030), though the latter allows the buying of carbon offsets. While the 2050 date was recommended by the UK\u2019s official Committee on Climate Change (CCC), May has rejected its advice on international carbon credits, whereby a country can pay for cuts elsewhere in lieu of domestic emissions. John Gummer, the CCC chair, said last month it was \u201cessential\u201d that such credits were not used. Doug Parr, the chief scientist for Greenpeace UK, said the target was \u201ca big moment for everyone in the climate movement\u201d and a legacy May could be proud of. However, he said the \u201cloopholes\u201d of allowing international carbon credits would need to be unpicked and the target date moved forward. \u201cAs the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, it is right that the UK is the world\u2019s first major economy to commit to completely end its contribution to climate change, but trying to shift the burden to developing nations through international carbon credits undermines that commitment,\u201d he said. \u201cThis type of offsetting has a history of failure and is not, according to the government\u2019s climate advisers, cost-efficient.\u201d May, who will mark the target on Wednesday by meeting science and engineering students, said it was \u201cthe time to go further and faster to safeguard the environment for our children\u201d. She said: \u201cThis country led the world in innovation during the Industrial Revolution, and now we must lead the world to a cleaner, greener form of growth. Standing by is not an option. Reaching net zero by 2050 is an ambitious target but it is crucial that we achieve it to ensure we protect our planet for future generations.\u201d The plan was endorsed by the CBI\u2019s head, Carolyn Fairbairn, who said such efforts \u201ccan drive UK competitiveness and secure long-term prosperity\u201d. She added: \u201cSome sectors will need clear pathways to enable investment in low-carbon technologies, and it is vital that there is cross-government coordination on the policies and regulation needed to deliver a clean future.\u201d Downing Street poured scorn last week on Hammond\u2019s warnings, disclosed in a leaked letter, saying the supposed \u00a31tn figure ignored both the economic benefits of action and the costs of not doing anything. A Treasury source said Hammond fully backed the 2050 net zero target but had pushed for a full costing of the plan to make sure it did not negatively impact on other areas of public spending. May has rushed through the legislation with one eye on her legacy after being effectively forced out of office before doing everything she wanted to in terms of domestic policy. Downing Street sources said implementing the target before she leaves No 10 in a few weeks\u2019 time was extremely important to May. It is understood she also reminded her colleagues in cabinet on Tuesday morning that she wanted them to make sure they did not forget about dealing with the fallout from Grenfell Tower after she leaves office."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
