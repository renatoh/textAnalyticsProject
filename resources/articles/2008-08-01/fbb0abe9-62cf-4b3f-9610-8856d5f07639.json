Man On Wire A mesmerising account of Philippe Petit's death-defying tightrope walk between the Twin Towers in 1974, perfectly capturing both the vertiginous terror and poetic beauty of this meticulously planned event. WALL-E Robots have feelings too. In fact, they possess more humanity than the humans in this delightful animation, which dresses its risky dystopian themes in slapstick comedy and wondrous visuals. Summer Hours Effortlessly affecting family drama of the type the French seem to make once a year and the British once a generation. Juliette Binoche and Charles Berling lead a bittersweet sibling fallout. The X-Files: I Want To Believe OK, so it's not the big-screen update it might have been, but hardcore fans of the series will appreciate the oldschool chills as Mulder and Sculder investigate a missing FBI agent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
