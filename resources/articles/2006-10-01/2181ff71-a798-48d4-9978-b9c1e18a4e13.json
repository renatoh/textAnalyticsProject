The British No2 had served for the match before losing the Masters Series encounter 6-2, 2-6, 7-5 after which Nalbandian said to Argentinian TV: \"All this selling himself as a gentleman just isn't true - he is the worst rubbish.\" The world No4 had just escaped from 3-5 down in the final set of an encounter Henman often dominated, but was struggling at 5-5 and 15-30 on his serve, when a three-way theatre of the absurd ensued. Nalbandian thought his first serve, which had been called a fault, was good, and after achieving no reprieve by tackling the umpire, wandered up to the net and tried at length to negotiate the decision with the Briton. \"He said to me 'how was it?'\" Henman said. \"And when I said I thought it was in, he said, 'Give me a first serve?' \"And I said, 'I give you a first serve at 5-5, 15-30, when I think it was in?'\" Henman questioned with sarcastic emphasis. \"Then he starts questioning my sportsmanship, and there's only one winner in that debate.\" The Briton denied the incident stuck in his mind, though the furiously creative way he played and won the next point suggested it might have been affecting him during that particular rally. There was not much he could do as his opponent showed wonderful control to save the two break points which followed, and Nalbandian raised his standard remarkably during the last four games. But it was still a frustrating finish for Henman, who did not serve quite so well at 5-4 as at 4-3 and 3-2, but who nevertheless served up lively mixtures of chip-and-charge, serve-and-volley, and truculently struck counter-hitting ground strokes which induced insecurity in Nalbandian. Indeed, there was a truculent quality to Henman himself. Perhaps this was exacerbated by being scheduled to an outside court, which was distinctly slower than the main stadium and had no Hawkeye to sort out the disputes. Once, after conceding the break which cost the first set, he smote his racket with an echoing crack on the ground; on another occasion, when battling to consolidate a second-set break, he hit a ball against an advertising hoarding in temper. Later, before breaking for 3-2 in the final set, he mocked the umpire, saying: \"Let me hear when you are saying, 'It skids' - I love that one.\" And just after Nalbandian broke back for 5-5, Henman exhaled the F word so loudly that almost everyone heard. Though not the umpire, apparently. Henman will not play the last Masters Series of the year, at Paris in a fortnight, which means that Basle next week is his last event of the year. This adds a further hint of regret, because although his ranking could rise to the mid-30s next week, Henman will not finish as high as his best tennis suggested he could. Nalbandian now faces Russia's Marat Safin. Tomas Berdych served 23 aces to beat the No6 seed Andy Roddick 7-6, 6-3. The 11th-ranked Czech had the only break of the match in the sixth game of the second set, hitting a winner after Roddick had received treatment on his left ankle, the same one that forced the American to withdraw in the first round at the French Open although he does not think it will keep him out of the Paris Masters as he looks to clinch his spot in the Masters Cup. \"I'm in pretty good shape right now - I think I'm close to being confirmed,\" Roddick said. \"But the priority now is to get healthy because I'm not sure what the upside to playing in Shanghai on a bum ankle is.\" The previous night David Beckham dropped by and was chivvied into making complimentary remarks about Henman and Murray, though he could not say much else even though he had really come to watch Rafael Nadal. Apparently Beckham is not the only Nadal fan in the Real Madrid dressing room as Ra\u00fal recently sent him a card describing the Majorcan as the best player on the planet. When Nadal pointed out that he is only the world No2, Ra\u00fal insisted on his opinion by saying \"Federer is a Martian\". Yesterday, however, Federer was a mini-break down in both tie-breaks before struggling through 7-6, 7-6 against Robin Soderling of Sweden. Sometimes it is good for us all to be reminded that really he is just another Earthling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
