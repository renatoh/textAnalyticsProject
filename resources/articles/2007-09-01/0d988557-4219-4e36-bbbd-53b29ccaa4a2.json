Years ago I invented a Liberal campaign against the menace of cocktail sticks which lurk inside snack sausages and club sandwiches, and can cause horrible damage to people's mouths. I forgot all about it. Then recently I went to a reception with a buffet. On the table was a little notice saying: \"Warning! Food contains cocktail sticks.\" So even the Lib Dems' fantasy campaigns work in the end. No other party can make that claim. Yesterday, for instance, they had a debate on excess packaging. They devoted quite some time to toothpaste cartons. One man said he had invented a toothpaste tube which didn't require a carton, yet had just bought one - in a carton! He was outraged. Why stop there? Why does toothpaste need a tube? Can't we buy it loose? In future we may be called on to recycle our toothpaste, spitting it out for re-use the next day. Only then will the planet be safe. They discussed that same topic yesterday afternoon. Normally this would be a signal for someone to warn that if we didn't make the entire world carbon-neutral within seven years we would all be doomed and our children would inherit a spinning ball of dust. Satisfactorily spooked, everyone would then drift off for a drink. Yesterday they were more optimistic. Change was on the way. All over the country, Chris Huhne MP said, Lib Dem councils were adopting \"exciting, innovative\" schemes. So that's a good slogan: Vote Lib Dem and save two billion lives! Or as the chairwoman summed it up, \"Distributive power distributes power!\" No one knew what she meant. But it sounded thunderously liberal. There were other fine Lib Dem moments. I liked the touch of rueful realism from Crispin Allard, who said in the debate on reforming government: \"These are good, intelligent arguments. They work with Liberal Democrats, but they are likely to fail with the people we are trying to reach.\" Ah, yes, the party's fundamental problem. They then moved on to a longish discussion about whether the next - indeed the first - Liberal Democrat government would hold a referendum on whether they should draw up a written constitution before they write the constitution and then hold a referendum on that. It was a little like watching the Flat Earth Society debate whether it should recognise New Zealand. A man called Paul Baron called for the restoration of the hereditary peerage in the House of Lords, \"because they are landowners, and it would be very difficult for corporate lobbyists to corrupt them\". Nobody booed or jeered or even appeared to notice. If he had demanded the return of hanging for sheep thieves, they would probably have coughed politely."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
