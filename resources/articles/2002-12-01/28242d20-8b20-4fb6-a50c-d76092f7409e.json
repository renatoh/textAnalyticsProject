The former This Morning presenter has been bailed until January, the police have confirmed. He was arrested at lunchtime today after voluntarily presenting himself for questioning. After leaving the station, Leslie sped off in a BMW people carrier pursued by several press photographers. Earlier today his spokesman reiterated previous complaints about a trial by media and protested Leslie's innocence publicly for the first time. The presenter was sacked from his job on ITV's This Morning in October after he failed to respond to a frenzy of press reports about his private life, prompted by the publication of Ulrika Jonsson's autobiography. Leslie has always denied the allegations in private but today made his first public rebuttal through his solicitors, Finers Stephens Innocent. They said the TV presenter \"strenuously denied\" all the allegations, would continue to deny them and had not been charged with any criminal offence. It is one of the very few public statements Leslie has made since he was named as the TV presenter at the centre of allegations in Jonsson's book. His solicitors said today was the first time Leslie had been given details of the allegations made against him. The full statement issued by Leslie's solicitors read: \"We can confirm that Mr Leslie attended voluntarily today at a London police station and for the first time, after some weeks of media speculation, he was provided with details of certain allegations that have been made. \"He strenuously denies all these allegations and intends to continue to do so but he will assist the police with their inquiries. At this time, Mr Leslie has not been charged with any criminal offence.\" The statement was issued around 3pm - two hours after it emerged Leslie had been arrested by police."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
