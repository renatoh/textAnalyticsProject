Presidential hopeful and Kentucky senator Rand Paul and Idaho congressman Ra\u00fal Labrador joined a number of senior Democrats at the Howard University panel convened in the wake of a string of controversial shootings, most recently in Charleston, South Carolina, and Tulsa, Oklahoma. Though shying away from commenting on the cases directly, both prominent Republicans said they were hopeful that broader legal reforms designed to reduce discrimination against African Americans were now gaining traction at both ends of the political spectrum. \u201cOne of the most exciting things in Congress is the right and the left \u2013 what I call the \u2018wingnut coalition\u2019 \u2013 is working together to improve justice in America,\u201d said Labrador. Asked whether other Republicans would join his calls for sentencing reform and police body cameras, Paul added: \u201cMore Republicans are coming on. This is becoming a right [and] left thing.\u201d Elijah Cummings, a leading African-American congressman who convened the meeting to address the \u201ccriminalisation, imprisonment and deaths\u201d of Americans of colour, said: \u201cRight now the nation is listening. Right now we have a moment to do a lot.\u201d But whether the unusual alliance of libertarian-leaning Republicans and the Democratic black caucus can overcome congressional inertia is far from certain. Others on the panel questioned why the deaths of black Americans \u2013 whether as victims of crime or at the hands of police \u2013 did not attract more outrage across the US. \u201cSome lives are more valuable than others,\u201d said Stacey Plaskett, congresswoman for the US Virgin Islands and a former New York prosecutor. \u201cThe urgency does not seem to be felt in this country to deal with ugliness that does not have to be,\u201d added New Jersey senator Cory Booker, who called for a national movement to match the suffragette and civil rights struggles. \u201cChange does not come from Washington; it comes to Washington,\u201d he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
