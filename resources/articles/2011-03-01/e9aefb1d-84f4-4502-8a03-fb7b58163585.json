Not that I'm implying that this Vaccines show was anything but spontaneous, you understand. Oh no. That a massive AOL Music banner had been erected, live-streaming was in effect and a T-Mobile promotional campaign was underway (more gigs should involve queuing punters being invited to test out the new Galaxy handset - it embodies the very spirit of rock'n'roll) was simply testament to how on-the-ball these company's can be. Ahem. Anyhow, let's talk about the Vaccines, a band who I've been slightly sniffy about in the past. Sniffy because when they try to rock out it all looks a bit contrived. Why watch mild-mannered lads go gonzo through Wreckin' Bar (Ra Ra Ra) when we've already got the Ramones and a million of their far more reckless descendants? Thankfully, though, this was a gig that overcame my cynicism through sheer force of melodies - there were more hooks here than with the former bassist of New Order on a fishing trip (I'm available to hire for weddings, bar mitzvahs etc). The Vaccines are at their best when they slow things down a tad to deal with messy relationship problems \u2013 see the chugging Post Break-Up Sex and If You Wanna. Half the songs sound identical but, when the song in question is this good, I've got no problem with that. You see, unlike this whole pop-up gig set-up, the Vaccines' shtick is gloriously throwaway. \u2022 Read all our latest coverage of SXSW music at theguardian.com/sxsw/music.
