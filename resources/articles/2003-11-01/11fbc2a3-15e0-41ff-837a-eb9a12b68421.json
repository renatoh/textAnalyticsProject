HSBC, Britain's biggest bank, was one of the targets and its share price dropped 1.3%. In volatile trading, the FTSE-100 closed down 19.4 points, or 0.5%, at 4,308. The blast destroyed the front of the modern HSBC office block and TV pictures showed bodies in front of the building. HSBC, which promotes itself as the \"world's local bank\", opened its first office in Turkey in 1990. Since, then the world's second-biggest bank has steadily expanded its presence in the country, catering for retail and corporate customers. In October 2001, HSBC acquired Demirbank TAS, the fifth-largest private bank in Turkey, and its wholly-owned stockbroking and fund management subsidiary, Demir Yatirim. That deal gave HSBC a network of 157 branches throughout the country and, in August last year, it agreed to acquire Benkar Tuketici Finansmani ve Kart Hizmetleri, a consumer finance and card services company. Hours after the blast at HSBC, Aviva, Britain's biggest insurer, announced the temporary closure of one of its offices close to the bank's Istanbul headquarters. Aviva said none of its 400 staff in the city had been injured, but added that it was reviewing the situation. \"We have contingency plans in place, and are now reviewing what further action we need to take in the light of today's tragic news,\" Aviva told Reuters. \"Our head of security in Turkey is reviewing our plans.\" Aviva has both a life and general insurance operation in Turkey, employing 1,600 people. As well as shares in HSBC, those in travel firms also fell, hit by concern about the impact of the attacks on international travel. Hilton, a hotel chain with eight hotels and more than 2,000 bedrooms in Turkey, tumbled 4%. Intercontinental Hotels dropped 2.9%. \"Just as the industry travel numbers were picking up, they have taken another hit. Business travel has fallen off, and this is another incentive to stay at home,\" Hilary Cook, director of investment strategy at Barclays Stockbrokers, told Reuters. Wall Street's fall was muted, with the Dow Jones average down some eight points by the London close, providing some relief to the London market after an earlier evacuation of the White House caused stocks to tumble."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
