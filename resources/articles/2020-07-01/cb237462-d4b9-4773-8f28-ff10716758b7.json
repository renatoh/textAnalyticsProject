The 21-year-old was injured by a dangerous tackle from the St-\u00c9tienne captain, Lo\u00efc Perrin, in the 26th minute. The lunge led to angry protests and tussles between both sets of players, with Mbapp\u00e9 leaving the field in tears as he was replaced by Pablo Sarabia. Perrin was sent off after a VAR review, with Mbapp\u00e9 later returning to the touchline on crutches and wearing a protective sleeve on his right ankle. The forward stayed on the field at the Stade de France for the trophy presentation, and was overheard talking to the French president, Emmanuel Macron. \u201cIt went crack,\u201d Mbapp\u00e9 said during the trophy presentation, before adding that he \u201cdidn\u2019t think\u201d he had broken any bones. Mbapp\u00e9 will have a scan later on Friday with the PSG coach, Thomas Tuchel, admitting he is \u201cworried\u201d by the injury and attacking St-\u00c9tienne\u2019s physical approach in his post-game interview. \u201cIt was complicated with all the fouls to Thilo Kehrer, Neymar and Mbapp\u00e9,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cIn the last three matches against St-\u00c9tienne they get a red card in the first 30 minutes. I don\u2019t know what is being said in their dressing room. It is horrible, I can\u2019t understand it.\u201d Claude Puel\u2019s underdogs hit the post in the fifth minute through Denis Bouanga, but fell behind nine minutes later when Neymar\u2019s shot crashed in off the underside of the bar. Puel may have feared a thrashing when Perrin was sent off but Les Verts, who finished 17th in Ligue 1, continued to pose a threat. PSG struggled to find any attacking fluency in the first competitive game in France since the coronavirus pandemic took hold in March. Neymar\u2019s goal proved enough to add one cup to their title, which was awarded on a points-per-game basis. They face Lyon in the last-ever League Cup final next Friday, aiming to complete a domestic Treble. Tuchel\u2019s immediate concern will be the fitness of Mbapp\u00e9, with the Champions League quarter-final against Atalanta coming up in Portugal on 12 August. The Italian side have been in free-scoring form since Serie A returned and even threatened a late surge towards the title \u2013 but those slim hopes were ended by a 1-1 draw at Milan on Friday. Hakan Calhanoglu\u2019s superb dipping free-kick put the hosts in front after 14 minutes at the San Siro, before Duv\u00e1n Zapata slotted home his 18th league goal of the season in the 34th minute. Neither side could find a winner, leaving Atalanta five points behind leaders Juventus with just two games left to play."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
