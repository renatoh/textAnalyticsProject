Among LA\u2019s right-leaning residents are the Daily Wire\u2019s Ben Shapiro, the political commentator Dave Rubin and the blogger Bill Whittle. There\u2019s also the former members of the defunct Friends of Abe, a secretive group of Hollywood conservatives that fractured in 2016 over the candidacy of Donald Trump. \u201cSilicon Valley has long despised the American right and it\u2019s beginning to flex its muscles against us,\u201d said Michael Knowles, an LA-based podcaster for The Daily Wire, referring to a lawsuit filed by conservative media site PragerU against YouTube for allegedly \u201ccensoring\u201d conservative videos. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of the time that Peter Thiel is heading down here because there\u2019s been a conservative renaissance in Los Angeles,\u201d Knowles said. PragerU\u2019s chief marketing officer, Craig Strazzeri, added: \u201cIt\u2019s both astounding and sad \u2013 but unfortunately not surprising \u2013 that there are parts of this country where you are socially and professionally shunned if you support the duly elected president of our country. That might be changing in Los Angeles.\u201d PragerU is one of a cluster of LA-based digital media organisations in the conservative movement that have, according to Knowles \u201ca disproportionate amount of influence on the right\u201d. This makes it the perfect place for Thiel to build his new right-leaning media business, first reported by BuzzFeed in January. The plan is to create a cable news network that would compete with Fox News and \u201cfoster discussion and community around conservative topics\u201d, according to the Wall Street Journal. According to the Journal, Thiel, who backed Trump\u2019s presidential campaign but describes himself as a libertarian, will move into the home he already owns in Hollywood and shift Thiel Capital and Thiel Foundation into new headquarters in the City of Angels. Thiel\u2019s decision to move to LA comes at a time when conservatives in the Bay Area are feeling increasingly squeezed by what they perceive to be liberal groupthink. \u201cSilicon Valley is a one-party state,\u201d said Thiel at Stanford University last month. \u201cThat\u2019s when you get in trouble politically in our society, when you\u2019re all in one side.\u201d The firing of James Damore by Google in August last year amplified conservative fears that Silicon Valley companies had become ideological echo chambers intolerant to their viewpoints. Thiel\u2019s decision to support Trump was unpopular among many of his progressive peers in the technology industry, with some calling for him to be dumped from the Facebook board. Although the social network\u2019s CEO Mark Zuckerberg disagreed, the Journal reports that Thiel \u2013 one of Facebook\u2019s earliest investors \u2013 has discussed resigning. \u201cSilicon Valley has become less tolerant and that\u2019s very troubling,\u201d said Garrett Johnson, co-founder of conservative think tank Lincoln Network. \u201cThere\u2019s a trend of monoculture and closed-mindedness.\u201d Others are far less troubled by Thiel\u2019s departure. \u201cI will choose to take this as a positive indicator that the movement of folks who care about equity in the tech sector is gaining some traction,\u201d said Catherine Bracy, the co-founder of TechEquity Collaborative. Maciej Ceg\u0142owski, a prominent San Francisco web developer and leader of the grass-roots activist group Tech Solidarity, agreed, but expressed surprise that \u201cin his search for safety\u201d Thiel wasn\u2019t fleeing to his adoptive home of New Zealand. \u201cThey were so eager to make him a citizen, and he\u2019s already got a bunker there,\u201d he said. \u201cOverall, I believe him leaving the Bay Area is a win. More young blood for the rest of us,\u201d he added, in reference to Thiel\u2019s alleged interest in injecting himself with young people\u2019s blood. For Joelle Emerson, the CEO of Paradigm, a company that helps tech companies diversity their workforces, Thiel\u2019s departure highlights the broader issue of people \u201cclaiming they are being silenced based on their conservative views\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to distinguish being silenced and being challenged,\u201d she said. \u201cLeaders in Silicon Valley who believe in building a diverse, equitable industry have not only a right, but an obligation to challenge others in positions of influence who undermine those goals.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
