Subs: Basinas, Chalkias, Dabizas, Georgiadis, Goumas, Kafes, Katergiannakis, Lakis, Nikolaidis, Papadopoulos, Tsiartas, Venetidis. Spain: Casillas, Puyol, Helguera, Marchena, Bravo, Etxeberria, Albelda, Baraja, Vicente, Morientes, Raul. Subs: Alonso, Aranzubia, Canizares, Capdevila, Cesar, Gabri, Joaquin, Juanito, Luque, Torres, Valeron, Xavi. The Ref: Lubos Michel (Slovakia) Pre-amble: You'll have noticed I'm late, so let's keep this simple. Whoever wins today can guarantee a place in the quarter finals and, quite possibly, a game with England. Greece were more impressive than Spain in their opening game, and I've sweepstake money riding on them. So if it's impartial coverage you're after, you may like to do one now. More pre-amble: Alas, no Torres in Spain's starting line-up, so no cheap shots at his ridiculous fairground tinker's mullet. But he's on the bench so all's not lost. 3 min: Lively start, end to end stuff, there be goals etc. and so on. 6 min: Katsouranis dumps Raul on the turf and sees yellow. The pattern appears set. 9 min: Dangerous ball in from the right is hammered behind for a corner, from which the ball floats agonisingly over Nikopolidis, the Greece goalkeeper, and just eludes several sweaty Spaniards at the back stick. Spain have started brightest. 12 min: \"Why have you posted a photo of Barry Glendenning on your report?\" asks Pete Baker, who appears to be monopolising tonight's report. Fair point, only Barry's mullet is several feet longer. More Spain pressure, by the way, and Nikopolidis looks hapless in the air. Goals I tell you. 15 min: Raul Bravo, the Leeds reject, is stopped in his plodding tracks by a superb Chalkias tackle. He would have been clear on goal otherwise so, erm, well done and so on. It's one-way traffic so far and the sweepstake housekeeping's not looking good. 16.5 min: Yellow for Marchena, who kicks Karagouni up in the air and concedes a free-kick on Greece's right. It amounts to nothing. 19 min: Look up and you'll see my email address has finally been added, heads are rolling and swingers being bruised as we speak. On the field, it remains all Spain, but they seem intent on walking the ball in. 22 min: Dass Agathangelou has asked me to point out that unless Greece made an early substitution, Chalkias couldn't have tackled Bravo in the 15th minute. Obviously I meant Charisteas, and now it all somehow feels complete. Thanks Dass. Really. 25 min: Now it's a yellow for Giannakopoulos, who clatters into Puyol, who completes 27 rolls for an impressive 9.5 mark. From the free-kick, Helguera directs a goal-bound free-kick away from the goal. Soon after, Karagounis knobbles Etxeberria and will miss their final game with a yellow of his own. GOAL!! Spain 1 - 0 Greece: 29 mins Mistake by Kapsis, losing control to Raul, who back-heels Morientes in on goal. He makes no mistake, burying it low and hard past Nikopolidis. It's been coming, and that's just what the game needed to bring Greec out a bit more. 33 min: It's all Spain, wave after wave of red, but they're still opting for the pretty pass. They could and should be further in front. 36 min: Brian Hennigan would like to point out that \"Fairy liquid also brings Greece out more.\" Do you see what he's done there, readers? Helguera's just been booked for kicking Vryzas, then stamping on his heel. And he then has the bare-faced cheek to make that I-went-for-the-ball motion thing footballers seem to enjoy. 39 min: A rare foray into Spanish territory for Greece there, but Charisteas takes a shambolic tumble in the box and normal service is resumed. 43 min: Greece are enjoying more possession but to little effect. In fact, dullards and social misfits might like to know the breakdown is 59%-41% in Spain's favour. Thanks to our man Sean Ingle for that. Half-time: Spain 1 - 0 Greece That statistic won't have changed much in the last two minutes. It's been a lively first half and Spain have definitely impressed more, but there's plenty left in this one. Oh, and two things. The Greece sweepstake is for the whole effing tournament, and no, I'm not taking the picture down, even if it is making you all nauseous. Back soon. 46 min: Joaquin's on for the second half, I think for Etxeberria. Otherwise it's as you were. \"I recently saw the film Troy, which was quite good,\" says Sam Knight, \"But I found the Greeks, with that horse, a little sneaky.\" Rest assured, Sam, the Greeks have no horse on the field today. Several donkeys, yes (honk!), but no hoss. 47 min: Snapshot from 25 yards by Zagorakis has Casillas sprawling, but it hits the side-netting. 49 min: \"Arsene Wenger wears a wig,\" suggests a man/woman/beast going by the name of Oates Oates.\"Discuss.\" 52 min: Without so far testing Nikopolidis this half, Spain are again controlling things and could have had a penalty when Vicente tumbles theatrically in the box. Never a penalty. Karagounis has gone off, Tsiartas is on. My guess, however, is that you're not really that bothered by such detail. 55 min: Raul heads over with a free header from eight yards out. Moments earlier, Zagorakis warmed the palms of Casillas again from distance. 58 min: The pedant that is Dass Agathangelou would like to point out that the use of sneaky horses (46 mins) is not exclusively a Greek trait. \"Did you see the Germany Holland match last night,\" he asks. And yes it's cheap, but we can certainly do cheap. 61min: Joaquin takes the most ridiculous tumble in the box and is lucky to have escaped a card. He then does that Italian hand thing, pleading his innocence. Moments later, former Leicester water carrier Zagorakis crunches into Morientes and the ref flashes yet another yellow. 64min: Corner to Greece. Mild excitement. Casillas comes and flaps and breathes a relieved sigh as the ball sails over the bar. Meanwhile, Valeron is on for Morientes. GOAL!! Spain 1 - 1 Greece, 66 mins: Oh dear, oh dear. Charisteas runs from deep and takes advantage of a missed header by Helguera to hammer home through Casillas' legs. Didn't really see that one coming. 71min: \"Troy was only enjoyable at one specific moment,\" reckons Bas Droesen. \"When hearing many 'ooh's' of surprise from viewers when the horse turned out to contain hidden soldiers.\" He watched it in America, I'm guessing. 73min: Joaquin stays on his feet long enough to hammer a shot narrowly wide of Nikopolidis' right-hand post. Close, but he's not smoking a fat Cuban cigar. And neither am I, our more regular readers might like to note. Eh, hombre? 76min: A brilliant twisting run from Joaquin wins Spain a corner. He takes it himself and, from five yards, Helguera heads his cross straight into Nikopolidis' midriff. Unbelievable miss. 79min: Next, Joaquin cuts in brilliantly for a clear sight of goal, then scuffs the ball hopelessly wide, giving the impression his left foot is clad in a welly. Or a clown's boot. Raul's done one, replaced by fairgraound tinker Fernando Torres (pictured right). 82min: \"You should know by now that Barry has cornered the market on freebies,\" notes Pete Baker. I am afraid I have no idea what you are talking about, Mr Baker. Freebies, you say? 84min: One-way traffic, mainly involving the aforementioned Joaquin, who Jon Boon believes is the flamenco dancer who went out with Naomi Campbell. Hmm, no. 86min: Someone on, someone off for Greece. A defender is all I know: fill in the dots yourself. 88min: The Spain threat has been snuffed out due to the fact there are three burly Greek lads breathing down Joaquin's neck. 90min: Torres has not had a kick since coming on, but his hair looks nice. Speaking of which, Puyol has his shirt pulled and wins a dangerous free-kick on the right edge of the Greek box... 90+min: ...from which they win a corner which comes to nada. Nice Spanish touch there. I'm trying, readers, really I am. FULL TIME - Spain 1 - 1 Greece: And that, as the heading suggests, is that. An unlikely point for Greece against snazzy but toothless opponents. I'm now off to smash some plates. I suggest you do likewise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
