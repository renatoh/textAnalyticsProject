Six days after losing the FA Cup final to the same opponents, however, the Gunners viewed their post-match celebrations as less than full compensation for what was the only defeat they have suffered in 11 FA Cup finals. \"Winning the league partly makes up for losing the final,\" said the manager, Laura Harvey, \"but we're still hurting from seeing someone else with the Cup. We went to Blackburn on Thursday and should have won the league there but we had the hangover from hell and had to settle for a draw. So playing Everton today was the best game we could have had and I'm delighted we've got the title again.\" Harvey, appointed manager in February but only until the end of the season, is hoping her efforts will gain her the job on a permanent basis. \"Winning the League and Cup double would obviously have given me a great chance but we came very close in the Cup final and hopefully I've proved myself. I'll be speaking to Vic [Akers, the general manager] shortly and things should be firmed up then.\" Harvey's opposite number, Mo Marley, has been in charge of Everton since 2002 and is still trying to wrest the \"best team in the country\" tag from Arsenal. Though they have beaten the Gunners in the League Cup as well as the FA Cup this season, they have lost both of the league games between the clubs and Marley said: \"Our problem is that we can do it in one-off games but not over the course of a season. That's why Arsenal are league champions and not us.\" In today's other league games Chelsea beat Blackburn 3-0, Sunderland won by the same scoreline at Nottingham Forest and Watford drew 1-1 with Bristol."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
