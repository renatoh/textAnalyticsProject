While Ruud van Nistelrooy implored the club to withdraw from transfer negotiations with Chelsea, making it clear that the players vehemently opposed the move, it also transpired that Veron had told his team-mates he wanted a \"new start\" at Old Trafford. That may still not be enough to persuade Sir Alex Ferguson and the United directors to turn down Chelsea's \u00a315m bid but Veron, having apparently accepted that the club were trying to sell him, seems to have used the perceived slight on his ability as the motivation to prove he can still justify his \u00a328m price. He was exceptional in United's hugely impressive 4-1 defeat of Juventus in Giants Stadium on Thursday night, earning the most-valuable-player award. And rather than fly to London this weekend, as had been widely expected, he should line up against Barcelona tomorrow as Ferguson's players open the Philadelphia Eagles' new stadium while hoping to show Ronaldinho he was wrong to turn them down this summer. Ferguson's judgment will be based on legitimate concerns about Veron's form over the past two seasons rather than a pre-season tour. However, the United manager must have been impressed by the Argentinian's performances in the US and the players believe he will begin the season as a United player. \"I'm happy for Seba because he's going to stay,\" said Van Nistelrooy. \"We've spoken about the situation and everything that has happened over the last few weeks but I think that is already in the past for him. \"He wants a second chance. He's told us he's trying to make a new start and I feel good for him. If you ask all the players not one of us would want him to leave. We all want him to stay and I think he will now.\" Despite his agent Fernando Hidalgo flying from Argentina into London for talks with Chelsea this week, Veron also reiterated he wanted to stay: \"I still have a lot to think about it, but my mind is clear.\" \"We are waiting for the decision of Alex Ferguson and Peter Kenyon,\" said Hidalgo. \"I would not have spoken to Chelsea without Manchester United's authorisation but if they want to keep Veron now we are happy with that.\" If that is the case, Ferguson must hope Veron keeps up this level of performance through an entire season rather than a series of matches that count for nothing other than pride. It was noticeable that Ferguson went to the touchline to applaud the midfielder after substituting him late in the game and also the affection with which his team-mates congratulated him on his part in two of United's goals. \"He controlled the game,\" said Van Nistelrooy. \"He is playing as though he has a point to prove. The players know what he can do because we see him in training every day, but he wants to show everyone how good he really is. He's the only player in the world who can pass like he does. He's in his best ever form and I've not seen him looking as determined as this before.\" Veron, indeed, showed the remarkable range of passing that makes him unique at Old Trafford, setting up Paul Scholes and Van Nistelrooy for two wonderfully taken goals at the start of the second half. Ryan Giggs had given United the lead with an exquisite free-kick and, with Pele among the 79,005 crowd, Van Nistelrooy's chest-down and volley, \u00e0 la Marco van Basten, was the highlight of a mesmerising performance. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made it 4-1 after Pavel Nedved had scored for Juventus. Marcello Lippi, the Juve coach, was so outraged that he substituted nine players immediately after Van Nistelrooy's goal. Ferguson could also reflect on a competent debut from Tim Howard, who on this evidence has quick reflexes and athleticism, and with Fabien Barthez out of favour it is reasonable to assume the American will begin the season as United's first-choice goalkeeper."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
