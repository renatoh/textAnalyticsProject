Ofcom officially takes over as the regulator for broadcasting and telecoms on December 29 and its chief executive, Stephen Carter, said a review of public service TV would be a priority. It will be overseen by Ed Richards, a senior partner on the Ofcom board and a former BBC strategy wonk and special adviser on media to Prime Minister Tony Blair. \"If PSB is to survive and thrive over the next 10 years and beyond, all of it needs a written constitution. Surely sound bites from the 1930s will no longer suffice,\" Mr Carter told the Royal Television Society Cambridge convention today. \"People have been trying to define public service broadcasting since God was a boy. For the first time [the new communications act] requires an independent regulator - not the government, not the BBC - but an independent regulator to take a holistic view across all the public service broadcasters, including the BBC. So, therefore, must our definition,\" he added. \"There is a trade-off in the price of the spectrum and the social benefits from the delivery of public service broadcasting. Our review will make this trade-off much more explicit and enable it to factor in the cost of ITV and Channel Five's licences and what Channel 4 currently gets for free. \"And, of course, the review will, as the secretary of state said yesterday, set the context for the BBC charter - what they are expected to deliver and the means they are given to do so.\" Mr Carter added that the communications act already laid down some elements of what public service television should deliver, including peaktime national and international news and current affairs, original UK production, and regionally and culturally diverse programming in a wide range of genres. He added that the PSB TV review would be broken down into three stages and look ahead at how it might develop over five years. The first stage will begin next month, with an assessment of the current state of public service broadcasting on the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Five. This is due to be completed by spring 2004 with a report, followed by a public consultation. Stage two will look at the prospects for the future and run from spring to summer next year, while the final phase of the review will focus on recommendations and is due to be finished by autumn 2004. Also on the agenda for the first year of the new regulator are a consultation on the introduction of a trading market for wireless spectrum and on working with Oftel on the introduction of new EU regulations for the UK telecoms industry, with a particular focus on broadband. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
