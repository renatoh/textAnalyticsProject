Meanwhile, Cara and Janine are the house's first same-sex couple. Despite a Tudor theme, their nuptials are surprisingly emotional for a quickie TV ceremony. One bride cheats and brings her own outfit. If you're going to be churned out of the Wedding Factory, you should use their packaging or have a proper wedding without the cameras. Still addictive though. JNR Whites 9pm, BBC2 Like the culinary artists it satirises, Whites is a sitcom that blends ingredients that are sometimes traditional, often subtle, but are increasingly surreal. Tonight's episode finds Roland, sous chef Bib and new arrival Skoose balancing a number of different plates. Bib has a narrow window in his schedule to deliver an offering to the fertility clinic, only to be thwarted by ducks crossing the road. Skoose lets power go to his head. Roland, meanwhile, finds he is headed for disaster when he dates a powerful woman, who has a disability (that he hasn't yet noticed). JR Jane Goodall: Beauty And The Beasts 9pm, BBC4 A young British woman called Jane goes into the African jungle, meets loads of chimpanzees and gets really famous: now where have we heard that story before? The life of Jane Goodall, a secretary from Bournemouth who ventured into the Tanzanian jungle in 1960 to study chimpanzees feels like something out of a kids' book. Beauty And The Beasts is not the most elegantly put together documentary but it serves as a great introduction to Goodall's life and work, which forever changed the way we see primates. AA Community 10pm, Viva Another double helping of this fledgling comedy show and already it's becoming apparent that it's the characters and not the plots that matter. Tonight's first deals with Abed's love of film and TV and how it protects him from real world disappointments; it's a pretty old comedy routine but brilliantly played with a payoff that's emotive without being sentimental. We also get some hilarious mix and matching of the cast as dim-bulb sports star Troy is mentored by Chevy Chase's older (and no wiser) Pierce. More cast jumbling in the second helping as Jeff finds an ally in gossipy single-mum Shirley \u2013 a mercilessly funny start to the series. PO'N Lip Service 10.30pm, BBC3 The first episode of this six-part \"relationship drama\" sets up its soapy stall with a pacey mix of sex, friendship and unsatisfying employment. So far, so This Life, but this Glasgow series is almost entirely about lesbians rather than lawyers. One of its strong points is a sense of humour, and though tonight's episode is a touch cheesy, it settles down quickly, which, appropriately, is the punchline to many a lesbian joke. RN Tom Daley: The Diver And His Dad 10.35pm, BBC1 The unnervingly youthful and prodigiously talented Tom Daley has become a household name and a byword for diving, especially useful in the discussion of footballing gamesmanship \u2013 although his best days, including hopefully the 2012 Olympics, are doubtless ahead of him. Jane Treays' film profiles him as he struggles to juggle his athletic training and his GCSE studies, as well as his relationship with his father Rob, who has maintained strong support despite his own struggle to beat cancer.
