It came as the duke and duchess launched a campaign to celebrate Black British \u201ctrailblazers\u201d with the Evening Standard to recognise \u201ca group of notable leaders whose influence is making a positive and lasting impact on British culture\u201d. The list includes the disability campaigner Danielle Oreoluwa Jinadu, the poet Henry Stone, and Liv Little, who founded gal-dem magazine. In a video interview with the newspaper, Meghan said: \u201cTruth be told \u2013 and I was in the UK for a few years until we moved back here \u2013 I didn\u2019t realise there was a Black History Month in Britain, and so to have that brought to our attention was really exciting from a standpoint of everything that is going on in the world.\u201d The couple called upon high-profile Black British figures who inspired them, including the Vogue editor, Edward Enninful, and the rugby star Maro Itoje, to each nominate one black person for their contribution to British society. In a separate article for the newspaper, the couple said: \u201cAs long as structural racism exists, there will be generations of young people of colour who do not start their lives with the same equality of opportunity as their white peers. And for as long as that continues, untapped potential will never get to be realised.\u201d In the piece they said: \u201cIf you are white and British, the world you see often looks just like you\u201d and spoke of the importance for young people of seeing role models and leaders who share their skin colour. They concluded the article by saying: \u201cWe cannot change history, nor can we edit our past. But we can define our future as one that is inclusive, as one that is equal, and one that is colourful.\u201d In the video, Prince Harry, sitting beside the duchess in their home in California, said he had recently become more aware of racism. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve had an awakening of such of my own because I wasn\u2019t aware of so many of the issues and so many of the problems within the UK and also globally as well. I thought I did, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d He added: \u201cYou know, when you go in to a shop with your children and you only see white dolls, do you even think: \u2018That\u2019s weird, there is not a black doll there?\u2019 \u201cI use that as just one example of where we as white people don\u2019t always have the awareness of what it must be like for someone else of a different-coloured skin, of a black skin, to be in the same situation as we are where the world that we know has been created by white people for white people.\u201d He said he wanted to use his platform to raise awareness of the \u201cmassive\u201d contribution that the black community makes to the UK. He described Black History Month as a month of celebration. Meghan added that the month reminded people of \u201cour shared humanity\u201d. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s educational, but it\u2019s also really exciting just to find more people in the community that are inspirational.\u201d When asked about whether she had any reflections on the Black Lives Matter movement in the UK, she said: \u201cThe impetus is from a place of recognising equality.\u201d She said she had the opportunity to speak to one of the founders of the movement in the US and described peaceful protests as a \u201cbeautiful thing\u201d. The couple also discussed the dance group Diversity\u2019s performance on Britain\u2019s Got Talent, which sparked thousands of complaints. Prince Harry said: \u201cWe spoke to Ashley Banjo a few weeks ago, straight after the Britain\u2019s Got Talent situation. And that in itself, I am sure even me talking about it will be controversial, but the reality of it is, he and his team of guys put on the most amazing display.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
