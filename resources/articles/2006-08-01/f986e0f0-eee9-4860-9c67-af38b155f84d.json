Mike Parton, who earned roughly \u00a38m in share options while boss at Marconi, is expected to collect a pay-off when he leaves Telent at the end of October. He also has 420,000 \"free\" Telent share options, currently worth more than \u00a32m. He was reported to be in line for \u00a35m through the sale of the business to American bidder Fortress Investments.
