In the midst of the England team's cricketing triumph, there has been an almighty fuss over the sport's defection to pay TV. Meanwhile, amid talk of the national game losing its lustre, the Premier League and the European Commission have been at loggerheads over football's next TV rights deal with the usual diplomatic briefings dissolving into bitter public sniping. Add to that the hullabaloo surrounding London's successful Olympic bid and there has been more than enough to keep sport on the front, back and financial pages. Roger Mosey spent this supposedly quiet summer, with no major international football tournament or Olympics, studying the form in his new role as director of sport. When he succeeded Peter Salmon, the former head of TV news was not universally welcomed. There were dark mutterings that cast him more as destroyer than playmaker, brought in to implement Mark Thompson's cost-cutting plans. For Mosey, a Bradford City fan and rugby league enthusiast, the motivation was simple: \"I do love sport, I loved the time I was on 5 Live and it's a fantastic thing to do. It's a job anyone would jump at.\" Others who remember his stint as controller of Radio 5 Live, during which it was named station of the year in 1998, believe that he favoured news over sport. In his defence, he cites a bitterly cold night watching Hearts play Celtic as part of a campaign to secure Scottish football rights. In many ways he moved at a good time and, in his first interview since taking the job in August, is in bullish mood. Salmon is generally considered to have left BBC Sport in good shape, tying up flagship events such as Wimbledon, the rugby union Six Nations, the World Cup and the Olympics until the end of the decade and beyond. Thompson, while not as much of a sports fanatic as his predecessor Greg Dyke, recognises its public-service value, particularly during big events such as the Olympics and the World Cup, and frequently makes great play of its ability to bind the nation together. But there was a period when it looked as though Sky would hoover up the rights to every sport going, and Mosey remembers \"a very real worry that we would end up losing everything to this gradual erosion\". Now the rights market has reached some kind of equilibrium. Broadly, the BBC has settled for the big one-offs - European Championships, Olympics, Six Nations, Wimbledon, international football - that bring a large live audience and appeal to a broader range of viewers. In the past couple of weeks, the corporation has also tied up new deals for formula one on radio and the World Championship snooker. It is also believed to be close to announcing that it will screen Liverpool's trip to Japan for the World Club Championships. Meanwhile, Sky has concentrated more on exclusive rights to the Premiership and a host of other sports that justify an annual subscription for enthusiasts. But the uncertainty over the next Premier League contract, combined with bad feeling over cricket rights, is going to upset that uneasy alliance. As things stand, the Premier League has offered to guarantee at least a sixth of live games to a second broadcaster other than Sky. EC competition chiefs want at least half of the matches to go to other broadcasters, destroying the model on which Sky Sports has built its business. While Mosey is far too canny to reveal his hand now, it appears clear that the BBC will bid for live games, as the basis on which it will make its case for a free-to-air presence. \"Everyone wants there to be a market. I don't think anyone would dissent from the view that a diversity of supply is probably good.\" Mosey will also point to the way the FA Cup appeared revitalised on the BBC last season when a concerted effort was made to promote it across the portfolio. \"The BBC should argue what it can offer through its range and depth.\" Match of the Day may not be the vital Saturday night post-pub tradition of yore, but Mosey insists it still performs a vital role and it is likely the BBC will bid for highlights. More than half the population tune in at least once during the season, he claims. With cricket, unsurprisingly, he is unequivocal that live Test rights should be placed back on the \"crown jewels\" list protecting them for free-to-air broad- casters. Having recently agreed a highlights deal for the 2009 World Cup, he says the BBC will return to the crease next time round. \"If we can solve the scheduling issue and if it's a market which is fair, which we think is probably best guaranteed by having cricket back on the list of listed events, then we absolutely would want to bid,\" he says, although rights may not come up until 2010. Research has shown, he says, that viewers can be divided into three categories - those who fanatically follow sport, those who come in for the big events and those who don't watch it at all. \"It's a question, which is true of a lot of sports, of public accessibility. All those people in the middle tier, those who are interested in sport but not fanatical about it, they're the people who are not going to pay \u00a3408 a year for a Sky Sports subscription and so next time won't be able to watch the climax of the Ashes. That's where there's a risk that cricket will lose out,\" he warns, pointing to the example of the Six Nations which decamped to pay TV before coming back to the BBC. There is also a question mark over finding space in the schedule for sports in what he terms \"the middle ground\". With the shift to digital, more and more highlights will end up available on demand. \"My hunch is that what you'll see is big events becoming bigger. The real question is that middle ground - some of those sports will have to fight quite hard to maintain their viability [in the schedule],\" says Mosey. But equally, fans of minority sports will be better catered for than ever before by \"a mix of interactive applications and broadband\". As such, the long-running debate about whether the BBC should launch a dedicated sports channel will become largely redundant, he believes. Outside of rights concerns, the other big question concerns the department's proposed move to Manchester. Salmon was supposed to be leading the project, a role that has now been assumed by director of nations and regions Pat Loughrey. Mosey, inevitably, backs the idea. \"The first question I was asked in my interview was whether I'd move to Manchester,\" he says. \"As a Bradfordian, I think the BBC should be around the UK. There's absolutely no doubt about that,\" he says. But with no ultimate decision set to be made until the licence fee settlement is agreed next spring, his staff are in a curious period of stasis. \"The challenge for me is that I don't want to bus a load of solemn, recalcitrant people up the M6 to Manchester. It's got to be a place they want to work.\" Mosey, a former Today programme editor whose sharp intellect is softened by an outwardly friendly charm, also plans to build further bridges between his former department and his new berth. There is a gap, he believes, for more intelligent analysis of big sports news stories.\"The first note I got from John Motson said it was really important we had journalism in sport, and that's true on every level. Football Focus, for example, has become more journalistic. But I would like to bring the approach of Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek to television,\" he says, adding that he is looking at commissioning a dedicated sports news programme. \"It's a multibillion pound industry that has to be held up to the kind of scrutiny that people expect.\" It's all change onscreen too. Mosey's arrival has coincided with the likely departure of one of BBC Sport's longest serving presenters. Steve Rider is about to jump ship for ITV, a bigger pay packet and a slot presenting its formula one coverage. \"In terms of what Steve was asking in terms of money and duration of contract ... we absolutely couldn't meet the demands he made and we will build and bring new people through,\" he says. The early signs are that Mosey will favour respected sports journalists and homegrown talent over arrivistes from elsewhere. \"I never entirely saw the characterisation that BBC Sport was taken over by moppets from Casualty,\" he says, but nails his colours to the mast by revealing that John Inverdale will take over Rider's berth presenting live Six Nations coverage (Gary Lineker will replace him as golf presenter). The key thing, he says, is that onscreen presenters have to be know- ledgeable and taken seriously whatever their background. \"I don't want people who are amateurs. Gary [Lineker] is a fantastically good presenter, Alan [Hansen] is terrific. Some of the critics think that bringing anyone from sport in is a bad thing. Absolutely not.\" In the longer term Mosey is clear about the direction in which he wants to travel and, the diplomatic facade slipping for a second, can't resist a little dig at Sky: \"I want the BBC to be a major player in national sport. Delivering sport in a way that people want when they want it. I don't think that involves trampling over genuine competition and free markets. I think we're a hugely important part of sports broadcasting but we're not in the business of world domination - which others might be.\" With all to play for in the tussle for Premier League rights, we're barely into the pre-match build up.
