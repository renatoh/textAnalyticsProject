A man called Dave and other blokes", "bodyText": "In the end it was pretty much business as usual. The first flush of Sky Sports' post-sexism-apocalypse reconfiguring \u2013 otherwise known as Ford Football Special live from The Hawthorns \u2013 looked an awful lot like the old Sky Sports, albeit with a few fresh faces (all male) and no immediate indications of a gender-politics awakening. Wigan Athletic's visit to West Bromwich Albion was Sky's first live Premier League match since the high\u2011profile departures of Richard Keys and Andy Gray. This was also, perhaps, a chance to draw a line in the sand, to illustrate emphatically the truth of the claim made by Sky's chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, that thick\u2011necked, oleaginous men talking about \"smashing it\" is \"against everything Sky Sports stands for\". With this in mind the choice of the first new\u2011era presenting team seemed quaveringly important. Who would Sky plump for in these first gasping, delivery-fresh moments of their post-sexism rebirth? Gloria Steinem? Wonder Woman? Any one of the impossibly glamorous radical feminist media-grrrls currently staffing the Sky Sports News desk? A man called Dave? In the event Sky plumped for a man called Dave. Dave Jones it was who loomed into view in the executive swivel-chair after an intro-segment that featured a series of quotes from Confucius, Socrates and, weirdly, the obscure ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus. Was this a statement? Were we about to witness a new fiercely cerebral Sky Sports, infused with the wisdom of the ancients? Perhaps not, but we did get the wisdom of Cyrille Regis and Arjan De Zeeuw, a pair of club-specific occasional pundits and politically neutral choices first up in the post Keys\u2011Gray-era studio pundit role. As was Dave himself, who is clearly seen as a safe pair of hands: today Sky announced that he will also helm the forthcoming football-coronary of Chelsea v Liverpool this coming Super Sunday, the kind of A-list gig that would generally have Keys and Gray stomping all over it like a pair of prime alpha silverbacks vandalising a banana tree. He seems nice enough, perhaps a little serious, with the open, pale, tremulous face of the kind of schoolboy who lives in constant fear of losing his favourite Biro. And so the guys chatted on in a neutral, rambling kind of way, perhaps attempting to defuse any lingering sexism-expectation by appearing almost completely chemistry-free and banter-neutral. \"Roberto is a great man manager,\" Cyrille opined at one point and this was about as gender\u2011specific as things got, although there was a strangely wince-inducing echo when Alan Parry on commentary blurted something out about \"smashing it into the net\". If you really wanted to you could point out that it took over an hour for the first woman to appear on screen (a crowd shot), what with Dave and the boys, and Alan and Martin up in the box, and the only bird on show anywhere the throstle on the West Brom badge. But this is the way of TV football and while it would have been a little jarring for Sky to parachute in a statement-woman it would still have been fun and also pleasingly penitent. Sexism aside, the issue of the new presentorial A-team is yet to be resolved. Does Jones really have the TV-biceps \u2013 not to mention the big square, flat-nosed TV-screen head \u2013 to fill the chair? Jeff Stelling is perhaps the popular choice, and he would be a good one. He may not be a woman, or even a compromise-metrosexual, but Stelling is a genuine departure from Keys and Gray in that he seems genuinely nice, something not even the staunchest, pro\u2011smashing it sex-caveman could seek to pin on Sky's departed headliners. Interestingly, Gray's voice, the voice of Sky for two decades, was absent from the usual goal-montage head-to-head round-up that preceded this game. Are Sky going to do this to their whole back catalogue? Are Gray and Keys being edited from their history so thoroughly that we will never hear \"Teek a boo son!\" or even \"And it's live!\" ever again? Post-sexism, the Sky studio did seem a little under-done and charisma-neutral. But at least, finally, you could just get on with watching the football."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
