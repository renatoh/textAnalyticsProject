The officer took the sign away, saying Harrison was entitled to his beliefs but that the US secret service \"could construe this as a threat against President Obama\". A spokesman said a supervisor realised the officer's decision to take the sign was an error and returned it after Harrison called the police department. Following a search of his home, secret service officers decided Harrison was not a threat to Obama's safety. Were Harrison's first amendment rights violated or was the police officer correct to confiscate the sign? Share your thoughts by sending us a response on our GuardianUS Twitter page.
