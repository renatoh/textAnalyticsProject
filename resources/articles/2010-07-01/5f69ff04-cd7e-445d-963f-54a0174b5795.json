Election fallout, part 3. The rest of this column is given to long-overdue tying up of loose ends from the general election and its aftermath: \u2022\u2008Labour \"just held Rochdale\", said a piece. Actually, Labour won it back from the Liberal Democrats, by 889 votes (Immigration minister: our policy was right, we just didn't tell people, 19 May, page 6). A panel in a final edition wrongly said Labour regained Norwich North from the Conservatives (Clark loses seat, 7 May, page 2). A corrections column \u2013 12 May, page 32 \u2013 said that a results map in our How Britain voted supplement (8 May, pages 6-7) should have shown Finchley and Golders Green in London as a Tory win from Labour, not a Tory hold. As a reader noted, the seat in its old boundaries was held by Labour, but when reconfigured it was deemed notionally Tory, so \"hold\" was acceptable. \u2022\u2008A story reported criticism of the chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, for treating his London flat as a second home in parliamentary allowance claims, yet later paying no capital gains tax when he sold it (Danny Alexander in spotlight over tax loophole, 31 May, page 6). But we described the mechanism incorrectly \u2013 implying that, to the taxman, Mr Alexander had designated his London and Scottish homes simultaneously as his main residence. In fact, the London property was sold as a secondary residence; when this is done within 36 months of a place becoming the secondary home, no CGT is payable \u2013 as long as it was the main home at some point during the time Mr Alexander owned it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
