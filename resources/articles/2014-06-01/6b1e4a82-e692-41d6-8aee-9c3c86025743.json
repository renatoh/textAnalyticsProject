Retired ACC Duncan McCausland strongly denies any wrongdoing in the way contracts were given to supply the PSNI with vehicles. McCausland, one of the PSNI's most famous senior officers over the last decade, was arrested at his home on Tuesday morning. PSNI detectives were given an extra 24 hours on Wednesday to question McCausland and four other people about the contracts. A solicitor for McCausland said there was no need to arrest him as he had volunteered to assist the investigation, and strongly denies the allegations against him. A civilian worker with the PSNI who was being questioned has been released pending a file being sent to the Public Prosecution Service. He has been suspended from duty. McCausland was later released. Four other people are still in custody including another police officer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
