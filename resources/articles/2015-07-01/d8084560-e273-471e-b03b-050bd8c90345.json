It was the first time the grieving parents had visited the unremarkable fenced off pathway, behind an auto repair shop and next to a busy highway, where their son died three months ago. Cicadas buzzed and cameras clicked. Judy Scott\u2019s sobs were, at times, audible over all else. Behind the chain-link fence was the spot where Walter Scott, 50, was shot from behind by North Charleston police officer Michael Slager on 4 April. The officer claimed Scott had grabbed his Taser. But eyewitness video emerged showing Scott was unarmed and running away from Slager when the officer opened fire. The incident commanded global headlines and Slager was charged with murder. On Thursday, however, as members of Scott\u2019s family, including his 24-year-old daughter Samantha, congregated at the site, they were unable to pick out the precise spot where he fell. A shrine that once marked it \u2013 a small crucifix, flowers and pebbles \u2013 had been removed. \u201cWhy they did that, I have no idea,\u201d Anthony Scott, Walter\u2019s 52-year-old brother, said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was right. I think this spot should remain that way and I don\u2019t think nobody should mess with it.\u201d Scott questioned whether the memorial had been removed by the city. A spokesman for the North Charleston city council said later it had not been their decision to remove it, and said the responsibility law with a private landowner. \u201cThe worst thing you can do is forget about somebody, and we\u2019re not going to let that happen in this situation,\u201d the Scott family attorney, Chris Stewart, told reporters in discussing the shooting. \u201cIt\u2019s a situation that should have been prevented. Officer Slager\u2019s actions before this should have been better monitored. This never should have occurred.\u201d After Scott\u2019s death, it emerged, through documents obtained by the New York Times, that Slager had used his Taser 14 times during his five years as a North Charleston police officer, prompting suggestions of a routine overuse of force. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re going,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cNot just with officer Slager but the people who were responsible for him and that type of environment where you would feel comfortable enough to shoot a man in the back that poses no harm. You have to have learned that somewhere.\u201d Slager awaits trial in an isolation unit at the Charleston County detention centre. The same unit holds 21-year-old Dylann Roof, who is accused of shooting dead nine black churchgoers at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church a few miles down the road. Anthony Scott passed condolences on to the grieving relatives of those killed in the massacre last month. \u201cThe pain is the same,\u201d he said. Stewart also compared Walter Scott\u2019s death to those at Emanuel AME. \u201cIt [Scott\u2019s life] was just taken carelessly\u201d he said, \u201cjust like the shooter at the church [did]. So coming out here today, with everything that was going on lately, was important for the family.\u201d Anthony Scott also used the day to welcome the news that the Confederate battle flag that has flown over the South Carolina statehouse grounds in Columbus was due to be removed on Friday. \u201cOn behalf of the family I just want to say that we\u2019re holding on and we\u2019re going to remain strong and continue to believe in God,\u201d he said. \u201cGod is going to bring us through and hopefully the family is going to receive justice at the end of the day, because that\u2019s exactly what we want. It\u2019s really a sad thing be here today, but we\u2019re going to be OK.\u201d Judy and Walter Scott Sr did not speak at all. Holding hands, they continued to gaze through the fence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
