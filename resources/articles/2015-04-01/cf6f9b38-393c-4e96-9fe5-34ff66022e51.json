State premiers and chief ministers began the Council of Australian Governments (Coag) meeting with the prime minister in Canberra on Friday morning. Tony Abbott said he wanted the focus of the meeting to be measures to address domestic violence, national security and illicit drugs. While state and territory leaders have applauded the decision to prioritise the domestic violence issue, they were agitating for a discussion about health and education funding. Premiers of all political stripes have demanded Abbott acknowledge that the $80bn in cuts to projected long-term funding for health and education foreshadowed in last year\u2019s budget left the states in an unsustainable financial position. \u201cThe biggest issue here is the health and education funding,\u201d said the New South Wales premier, Mike Baird, on his way in to the meeting. \u201cWe got to the position where we woke up [to the federal budget] and saw that the long-term funding of health and education had been shifted back to the states. That\u2019s not sustainable. That has to be dealt with.\u201d Other states and territories have echoed those calls about health and education funding. But on the distribution of GST revenue the Western Australian government has found itself isolated. WA has criticised the system and called for a greater share after the Commonwealth Grants Commission recommended it receive only 30c in every dollar that people in the state paid in GST next financial year. The treasurers of all states and territories except WA wrote to the federal treasurer, Joe Hockey, saying it would be \u201cunacceptable to make significant one-off changes to address an issue for a specific state at the expense of all others\u201d. On his way into parliament for the Coag meeting, Barnett said he was \u201cextremely disappointed ... that both Liberal and Labor governments around Australia should gang up on one state government\u201d. \u201cI have never in my experience seen the other states and territories gang up against a single state,\u201d the WA Liberal premier said. \u201cWe are the state that is funding them and largely funding the commonwealth budget, because of the strength of the mining industry over recent years. I was just absolutely disappointed in those governments and individuals involved in that. That is not the way we should be doing business.\u201d Baird rejected Barnett\u2019s characterisation of the other states \u201cganging up\u201d on WA. Baird said states were simply arguing against a \u201cknee-jerk\u201d change to a long-established system that was \u201cnot perfect\u201d but had worked reasonably well for a long time. The letter from the seven treasurers warned against moving away from horizontal fiscal equalisation - the principle guiding GST revenue distribution. The principle is that states should receive adequate funding that allows each state to have the capacity to provide services to a similar standard. \u201cThe adoption of the commission\u2019s independent recommendations, in line with historical practice, is the only equitable option, and we are unable to support any alternative distribution method,\u201d treasurers said in their joint letter to Hockey. \u201cIf external assistance is necessary to tackle Western Australia\u2019s budget challenges, we call upon you to pursue such solutions outside of the GST distribution system.\u201d That final statement left the door open to a one-off payment of the kind advocated by the federal opposition leader, Bill Shorten, so long as it did not come from the GST revenue pool. The South Australian Labor premier, Jay Weatherill, said WA\u2019s demands were a \u201cpantomime\u201d. The Tasmanian Liberal premier, Will Hodgman, opposed \u201ctinkering\u201d with the system. \u201cIt should be a very short conversation today about the GST,\u201d he said. The Queensland Labor premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said everyone should \u201caccept the independent umpire\u201d on the distribution of GST revenue. She would \u201cnot cop\u201d Queensland losing hundreds of millions of dollars in a revision to the distribution. Palaszczuk said she was keen to use her first attendance at a Coag meeting to push for the federal government to \u201caccelerate some of their money towards the states\u201d for the national disability insurance scheme. In his opening remarks to the Coag meeting, Abbott said the challenge was for everyone in the room \u201cto be national leaders\u201d and \u201cwrestle with the national problems which are a challenge to all of us collectively\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some big reform issues that we will be dealing with today and for quite some time to come - the big issues of our federation, the big issues of tax - but there are some particularly pressing problems that we also want to deal with today,\u201d he said. One of those topics - domestic violence - was the focus of a pre-Coag breakfast attended by Australian of the Year Rosie Batty and former Victoria police chief Ken Lay. State and territory leaders voiced optimism about progress on the issue, including a national domestic violence order scheme to ensure such orders were recognised across borders. The Victorian Labor premier, Daniel Andrews, said family violence was a \u201cnational emergency\u201d and Abbott should be congratulated for putting the issue on the national agenda. \u201cHopefully we can get some national agreement on things like intervention orders that can apply everywhere,\u201d Andrews said. Michaelia Cash, the minister assisting the prime minister for women, told Sky News it might be \u201cthe one issue today where we will see furious agreement\u201d from all states and territories and the commonwealth. She said it was unacceptable that domestic violence orders were not recognised across jurisdictions. The Coag discussions would canvass the changes required to ensure such orders had legal standing in each state and territory, Cash said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
