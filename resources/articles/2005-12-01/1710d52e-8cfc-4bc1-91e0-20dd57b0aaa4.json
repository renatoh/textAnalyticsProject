Newcastle were only two places above the Tykes and that fact was mirrored in the character of the game. Only three points separated the teams at half-time and the second period was such a tight affair that it yielded no points at all. Leeds had more ball and carved out more openings but lacked the patience and composure to turn them into points. \"We created enough chances to win two games let alone one,\" said Phil Davies, the Leeds director of rugby. \"If we ever needed four points, we needed them today.\" Leeds enjoyed much of the play in the opening 15 minutes but could not crack the Newcastle defence. After soaking up the pressure, the Falcons responded when Mathew Tait collected Toby Flood's delicate grubber kick to score the opening try. Matt Burke converted from the touchline and although Gordon Ross reduced the deficit with a penalty from wide out, Burke replied with one from the halfway line to make it 10-3. It seemed that Leeds would never break down the solid Newcastle defence but a brilliant pass over his shoulder by Justin Marshall paved the way for Stuart Hooper to put Andre Snyman in at the corner. Ross levelled the scores with the conversion but just before half-time another long-range penalty from Burke nudged the visitors ahead. The second half produced few clear-cut scoring opportunities with the Tykes producing the best effort only to be denied by a forward pass. Rob Andrew, Newcastle's director of rugby, summed things up when he said: \"It was a massive game in the context of the season. It would have spoiled my Christmas [had we lost]. It was always going to be tough but I think we just about deserved it. It's the best we've defended all season. We didn't do a great deal in attack, it was just a case of us holding our nerve. Burke's goalkicking was top class.\" Newcastle's home game with Worcester on Sunday could see the return of Jonny Wilkinson. \"We're going to have a look at him on Thursday and Friday,\" said Andrew. \"He was pretty close today, so if he's right for Sunday he will play some part in the game.\" Leeds must pick themselves up for the journey to Gloucester, but Davies is not too downhearted. \" I'm disappointed but not too emotional about it,\" he said, \"but we can't afford too many more bad days at the office.\" Newcastle Falcons: Burke (capt); Shaw, Noon, Mayerhofler, Tait; Flood (Williams, h-t), Grindal; Ward (Williams, 50), Long (Thompson, 62), Morris, Perry, Grimes, Finegan (McCarthy, h-t), Harris, Charvis.
