He's now a grandfather but in London at the weekend he was mobbed by still loyal fans - presumably waving their walking sticks - at a signing of his top 10 LP Love Songs of the 70s, where the venue's switchboard was apparently jammed by callers. The last time he had an LP this high in the UK charts Ted Heath was prime minister and we were all brushing our teeth in the dark. Jane Austen had it right: a lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love.........in a moment. As proof, Anne Hathaway, star of the new film in which she plays the novelist, told the Radio Times she could not trust anyone who doesn't love Austen: \"It's like people who don't like dogs. It's like: 'What are you thinking? Who are you? Why are you evil?'\" Hathaway, you have delighted us long enough. That least Austenish of authors, Stephen King, would understand such sentiments. Well, the evil bit. He has announced plans to enter a new literary genre: comic books. A picture version of his series The Dark Tower is looming. \"I am a big fan of the medium. It's like being a kid with a chemistry set. It asks something more of the reader.........you have to learn how to read it and find out you're going to be challenged. It's a little like a tour of your own imagination.\" Duh, yeah, as Miss Austen would say. Cardinal Giacomo Biffi, former archbishop of Bologna, has been on appropriately biffing form in a series of Lenten sermons to Pope Benedict XVI. The 78-year-old cardinal, well-known for his brilliant wit and conservative views, says the Tablet, startlingly denounced Christians who idolise relative modern values such as \"solidarity, love for peace and respect for nature\" as representatives of the anti-Christ. This effectively puts him in league with certain American fundamentalists who believe the Pope fits that bill. Biffi has long held such views: in 2000 he predicted the anti-Christ would be \"an admirable philanthropist, a committed active pacifist, a practising vegetarian, [and] a determined defender of animal rights\". Hard to know where to turn. Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas (incidentally also a committed Catholic and member of the Christian Right) hit the campaign trail for the presidency at the weekend. The long march began with a single step...-...in his case to speak at a pizzeria in Orange City, Iowa. \" I really like him,\" one of the diners told the New York Times, \"He's very common.\" Well, it's a start. stephen.bates@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
