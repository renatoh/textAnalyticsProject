On the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A, Joyce said he didn\u2019t like the changing of party leaders \u201cby the intrigue of the party room\u201d. \u201cBut it\u2019s part of the process and now we work with the process. To be honest, these sorts of occurrences don\u2019t bring out the best in characters, they bring out the worst, because it becomes a world of intrigue \u2026 now I want to make sure that we get back to business and work as hard as we can.\u201d Joyce said he didn\u2019t think it was right to launch leadership coups but that the conventions of Westminster parliamentary democracy allow it. He said he always felt in the Coalition cabinet \u201cthere were two giants in the room\u201d. \u201cWe had Abbott, now we have Turnbull.\u201d \u201cWhat would have been better, to be honest, is if Tony had stepped down. It was becoming quite clear that the polls were saying it would be unlikely he would be able to win. I don\u2019t think Tony would have taken us over a cliff. \u201cI think the proper process would have been Tony stepping down. Malcolm has always been the obvious heir apparent, and that would have been the preferable path.\u201d Joyce said there would no new breakaway conservative political party formed from within Liberal ranks, previously mooted as being led by the rightwing South Australian senator Cory Bernadi, and last night mocked by host Tony Jones as \u201cBernardi\u2019s Golden Dawn\u201d, a reference to the ultra-right Greek political party. While the Coalition has enjoyed a significant boost in the polls with the change of leadership from Abbott to Turnbull, Labor\u2019s shadow health minister, Catherine King, said the government\u2019s policies were unchanged."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
