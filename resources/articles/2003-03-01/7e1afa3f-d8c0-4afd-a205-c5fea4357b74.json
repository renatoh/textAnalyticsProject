Supporters of Arsenal or Chelsea face a 400-mile round trip to Manchester to take on Sheffield United in a 1pm kick-off at Old Trafford on April 13, while Southampton and Watford will head north for a 4pm start at Villa Park in Birmingham. The FA cites inadequate facilities in London as the reason behind making a decision it knows will be unpopular with fans. They discussed the possibility of Southampton and Watford playing at Arsenal's Highbury stadium or Chelsea's Stamford Bridge. However, the Metropolitan police are reluctant when they have to handle the London marathon on the same day. Crowd segregation was high among the issues worrying the FA, who say they had to ask the two clubs to play at Villa Park, a 280-mile round journey from Southampton and 230 from Watford. Villa Park was the FA's original choice for the Sheffield United game but that has had to be switched to Old Trafford, a move that will hardly go down well with the London-based supporters of either Arsenal or Chelsea. The FA has exacerbated the travelling problems by sanctioning an early kick-off so the match can be shown live on the BBC. If Arsenal beat Chelsea in their quarter-final replay at Stamford Bridge, it will be the third successive season their fans have had to decamp to Manchester at this stage of the competition. Last night the FA defended the decision, saying it was unlikely London will host a semi-final until a new national stadium was erected. Sheffield United will view yesterday's draw as a dubious reward for extinguishing Leeds United's hopes in Sunday's quarter-final at Bramall Lane. \"I don't think anyone will have their money on us, but I don't think it is beyond us to beat either of them,\" the Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock said after they were given the draw they least wanted. Warnock's disappointment was in stark contrast to the mood of the Watfordmanager Ray Lewington. \"We have to be happy to avoid Arsenal and Chelsea and I'd imagine Southampton will be pleased about it, too. But we've caused a few shocks so there might be another one.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
