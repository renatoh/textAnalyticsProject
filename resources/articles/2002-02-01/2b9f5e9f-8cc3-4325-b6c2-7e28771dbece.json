The point salvaged in Istanbul on Tuesday when they deserved all three left Phil Thompson's side adrift in Group B and cursing their inability to see off the Turks. \"Our performance was of high quality but we need to be more ruthless in front of goal,\" said a baffled Thompson, who watched aghast as John Arne Riise, Vladimir Smicer and even Michael Owen were thwarted by Ali Mondragon, Galatasary's outstanding goalkeeper. Similar profligacy in Barcelona in a fortnight's time will extinguish all remaining hope. \"I would be more disappointed if we weren't creating anything, but the biggest thing the Champions League has taught us compared with the Uefa Cup is that you have to take your chances when they come,\" Thompson added. \"We've seen teams lose out on the amount of possession they have but they snaffle an opportunity and win 1-0. I think we've got the players to do it. We've got to be more clinical.\" The Reds are suffering from a common complaint. Sir Alex Ferguson pointed to a blunt edge when Manchester United slipped out of Europe in the past two seasons and promptly bought Ruud van Nistelrooy. He has plundered eight goals in this year's competition; Liverpool have managed nine in 10 games, with Owen scoring only twice and Emile Heskey breaking his duck in Istanbul. \"It is harder to score in this competition,\" said Owen in the build-up to the trip. \"The quality of the defenders is so much better and you don't get as many chances, so when they do come along you have to make sure you take them.\" In the end the underused Jari Litmanen, given a rare cameo from the bench, found time enough to create the decisive opportunity for Heskey, though the Finn must be finding life hard on the sidelines. At least the creativity of Danny Murphy, an inspiration on the night, offers a glimmer of hope for qualification. \"Maybe four points from our last two games will be enough to get us through,\" he said. \"Barcelona may be a little overconfident after their win at Anfield. But we went to the Nou Camp and did well [0-0 in last season's Uefa Cup semi-final] and we won't be fazed. It's still in our own hands.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
