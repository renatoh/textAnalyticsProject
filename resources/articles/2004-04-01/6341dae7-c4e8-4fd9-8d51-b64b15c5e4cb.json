Keane, the former Republic captain, has not played for his country since his highly publicised row with former international manager Mick McCarthy shortly before the start of the 2002 World Cup finals. The 32-year-old, who has won 58 caps, announced his retirement from international football soon afterwards. However, Kerr took over from McCarthy at the end of that year and kept in contact with Keane, culminating in the player declaring his intention to play for Ireland again. Keane - who perhaps feels he has some unfinished business in international football - is expected to go straight into the squad for the friendly international away to Poland on April 28. More importantly, however, he will be available for Ireland's World Cup qualifying campaign which begins at home to Cyprus in September. European Champions France are also in Ireland's qualifying group. Keane's return was welcomed by Kerr, who told the Press Association: \"Since our initial meeting following my appointment 15 months ago, when the player had clearly indicated his desire to play for Ireland, we have been in occasional contact. \"The issue for him was establishing a basis by which his club, Manchester United, would facilitate that desire. Roy Keane had to resolve that problem himself. \"A number of weeks ago, I spoke about the fact that there were some Irish players playing at the top level who had chosen, for a variety of reasons, to retire from international football. \"Playing for the international team is demanding. It involves hard work when you are free of your contractual obligations with your club. \"It involves working with a different management team that has set ideas which may well be different to those which you experience at the club. \"To represent your country is, however, to my judgement, the greatest honour any athlete can experience. It was for that reason I wanted all those players who had retired early to know that it would be possible to make themselves available again in the event that they ever had a change of heart. \"I am glad that one of the greatest players ever to play for Ireland has chosen this path. It cannot have been an easy decision for him but his desire to represent his country is immense. We met last week and discussed everything about his decision in great detail. \"He had addressed the issue with his club before that meeting and they are aware of his decision to make himself available for international duty with immediate effect. \"I look forward to working with Roy Keane. He brings quality and experience to a potentially excellent squad of players whose sole focus is the World Cup qualifying matches next autumn.\" FAI chief executive, Fran Rooney, also welcomed Keane's return and added: \"We look forward to Roy Keane playing for Ireland again. It is important that we should have all our top players available for the forthcoming World Cup campaign. \"Roy's decision to return is evidence of the new professionalism within the FAI and of Brian Kerr's professional approach within the squad. \"Ireland faces tough opposition in the World Cup qualifiers and Roy's presence will be a huge boost in our quest for qualification.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
