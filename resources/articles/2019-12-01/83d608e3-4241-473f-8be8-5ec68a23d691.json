Amid the festive cheer of the first ever such event \u2013 where Khan helped serve a three-course lunch of smoked salmon, roast turkey and pear tart before many took to karaoke \u2013 people spoke of their struggles accessing services and the omnipresence of drugs, as well as opportunities to gamble, on the streets. \u201cYou\u2019re made to scream for help and unless you do that it doesn\u2019t come,\u201d said Scott, a 45-year-old who slept in a park for a year. \u201cYou have to fight tooth and nail for what you are entitled to.\u201d Now, however, he has his own flat \u2013 after being helped by the charity St Mungo\u2019s. \u201cI was lucky,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes most people about four years, if at all. We definitely need more social homes built. They want to move you on from the hostels but they can\u2019t.\u201d Cherelle, 30, explained how she was evicted from her housing association home for falling into rent arrears while she was sectioned, and lived in a cupboard at a housing block before being forced to move on. \u201cThere was no safety net, being mentally ill and addicted to drugs, it\u2019s a double-edged sword,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re always fighting a battle. You\u2019ve got to be at rock bottom before someone says here\u2019s a hand. Rather than being able to ask for help before you get to that point.\u201d She is now living in one of the St Mungo\u2019s accommodation centres, along with many others of those at the event \u2013 none of whom is still sleeping rough. However, some have had to move to other boroughs away from their support networks to get a roof over their head. Almost 9,000 people were seen sleeping rough in London by outreach workers last year, more than double the number in 2010-11, according to the mayor\u2019s office. Rough sleeping has also more than doubled across England and Wales over the last decade, and there is growing public concern. Churches, libraries and other buildings in Bradford, Newcastle upon Tyne, Derry and elsewhere were opened on Tuesday to provide Christmas dinners for homeless people. Next to the River Thames at City Hall, while people watched the seasonal film Elf and played Jenga, Khan called on the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to work with him to end rough sleeping. \u201cI don\u2019t pretend today is going to solve all these problems, it\u2019s about giving some vulnerable Londoners a special experience at this time of year to raise awareness about these issues, and to give people hope that we can end rough sleeping once and for all,\u201d he told the Guardian. The mayor said he has persuaded councils to provide shelter to all rough sleepers when temperatures approach zero in any borough in London. Downing Street has announced an extra \u00a363m in funds to help tackle homelessness, but Labour said it was \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d. Khan blamed a lack of social housing, an unfit-for-purpose private rental market and social care cuts as well as the \u201cdisastrous\u201d universal credit system for helping to drive increased homelessness. \u201cI say merry Christmas to Boris Johnson, congratulations on the general election victory, but let\u2019s work together to solve this,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we are judged as a society by how we treat the most vulnerable and we\u2019re letting them down.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
