Here's the 2010 Christmas reading list, compiled by you. Christmas verse was popular with many of you, with \"A Child's Christmas in Wales\", Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and \"The Night Before Christmas\" all receiving mentions. PMakar explained why her vote went to Dylan Thomas: \"'A Child's Christmas in Wales' is my favorite. No preaching; no sentimentality. But real feeling, wonderful humor, and beautiful language.\" As with the Books desk's choice of favourite Christmas tales, children's books dominated the nominations. natalie1 and galfriday nominated Dodie Smith's The Hundred and One Dalmations, while Rachelthedigger, seconded by Garkpit, suggested JRR Tolkein's Letters from Father Christmas. Many of you agreed with Sarah Crown and chose the The Dark is Rising, Ianmark declaring it \"perfect from first word to last. Not just one of the best Christmas books, but one of the finest novels ever written for children.\" But, it was John Masefield's The Box of Delights with seven nominations, and Dickens's A Christmas Carol with eight, that proved the most popular festive tales. As Dowland says: \"A Christmas Carol. Much imitated. Never bettered (except by the Muppets...).\" In no particular order, here are some of the most voted for Christmassy reads: A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens The Box of Delights by John Masefield The Dark is Rising by Susan Cooper Children of Green Knowe by Lucy M. Boston Letters from Father Christmas by JRR Tolkien A Child's Christmas in Wales by Dylan Thomas The Gift of the Magi by O. Henry The Hogfather by Terry Pratchett The Night Before Christmas by Clement C Moore Sir Gawain and the Green Knight Simon Armitage's translation The Hundred and One Dalmations by Dodie Smith A Christmas Memory by Truman Capote The Christmas Mystery by Jostein Gaarder"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
