But I did alright, physically. At the beginning of the match I was apprehensive about playing a long match, you pace yourself. You do that as a junior when you come into the seniors.\u201d Murray, who was beaten in five sets by Roberto Bautista Agut at the Australian Open in January 2019 before undergoing a hip resurfacing operation that kept him out of action for more than a year, was a shadow of his former self in the opening two sets and survived a match point in the fourth before eventually winning 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, (5) 7-6, (4), 6-4 in four hours and 39 minutes. \u201cOnce I got two sets down, I had to put the after-burners on, and I managed to come through,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to start striking the ball better. I was hitting it late and was a little bit tentative. Then I went and took too many chances and made too many errors. I didn\u2019t have the balance.\u201d Murray added: \u201cMy body hurts. I need to recover as best as possible. I need an ice bath now, but they stipulate you can only have one if it\u2019s an emergency. I\u2019d say this was an emergency, so I\u2019ll go and see if I can have one here straight away, before I go back to the hotel. That was by far the most tennis I have played since the 2019 Aussie Open against Agut.\u201d Murray next plays the 20-year-old Canadian Felix Auger Aliassime, who had to fight for three hours and 51 minutes to overcome the Brazilian world No83 Thiago Monteiro, 6-3, 6-7 (7), 7-6 (6), 7-6 (6), while British No1 Dan Evans advanced in straight sets against Thiago Seyboth Wild. Contemporaries who have known Murray all his career, and had seen many such comebacks from him, were none the less as stunned as the loser watching his performance. \u201cAbsolutely remarkable,\u201d said Tim Henman. \u201cAfter four hours and nearly 40 minutes, it\u2019s going to be tough. The recovery in the next 36 hours is going to be very important and we\u2019ll just have to see how he copes. \u201cWhat got him through that was his heart. You can look at his performance and the first two sets were very ordinary. Nishioka hasn\u2019t got a big serve but he\u2019s awkward. Murray was only able to break him three times in five sets. That was part of his conundrum. He had to find a way. But, as is the case when you are that big a competitor, it doesn\u2019t necessarily what parts of your game are firing, you\u2019ve got to find a solution. And Andy Murray did that again.\u201d If Murray and Evans win on Thursday, they will meet in the third round \u2013 a proper Battle Of The Brits."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
