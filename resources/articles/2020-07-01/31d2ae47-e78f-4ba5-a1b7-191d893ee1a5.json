Andriy Yarmolenko\u2019s late goal secured a priceless victory for West Ham after Willian had scored twice for Chelsea, ensuring David Moyes\u2019s side moved three points clear of the relegation zone. But having defeated Manchester City to crown Liverpool as champions and also beaten Leicester to reach the FA Cup semi-finals, Lampard admitted this setback was an indication of how far his team must progress if they are to challenge for the title next season. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of where we are \u2013 we have a lot of hard work to do to get to where we want to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason the rest of us are chasing Liverpool and Man City is because of the consistency they have developed so that is what we have to work towards. It\u2019s obviously frustrating but if we are in that position it\u2019s how you bounce back and move forward.\u201d Poor defending from Chelsea allowed West Ham to go ahead thanks to goals from Tomas Soucek and Michail Antonio before Willian\u2019s equaliser from a free-kick. Yarmolenko\u2019s goal in the 89th minute means Chelsea still trail Leicester by a point after their defeat to Everton, with Manchester United and Wolves two points behind Lampard\u2019s side. He refused to blame his players for their first defeat since the restart and said they must look ahead to Saturday night\u2019s game against Watford at Stamford Bridge. \u201cI\u2019ve not been let down by my defenders \u2013 we\u2019ve made mistakes in the buildup to the goals, not just defenders, which cost us the game,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a wake-up call because every game is different. This wasn\u2019t a huge surprise \u2013 if you know the Premier League and you make mistakes, it can happen. We have to accept it and move on.\u201d West Ham\u2019s victory was their first since the restart and Moyes said it was fully deserved after Soucek\u2019s goal had been controversially ruled out for VAR in the first half. \u201cOne win is not enough \u2013 we have to win more if we\u2019re still going to be a Premier League club,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after the performance that we saw Chelsea put in against Manchester City, it was an outstanding result for us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
