The 23-year-old jockey, who has spoken with disarming frankness about his struggles with addiction that led to a positive test for cocaine, added that he was particularly grateful to his weighing room colleagues for the warmth of the welcome he received when returning to work at the weekend, and even more so to the trainer Charlie Hills, who has been extremely supportive as the rider works hard to leave his old habits behind. \u201cIt was amazing,\u201d Shoemark said in reference to his win aboard Heroic. He had made the two-hour journey from Lambourn to Lingfield for the one ride and it proved to be entirely worth it when Heroic held off the odds-on favourite by a neck. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s only natural to get a bit nervous beforehand. There was a lot of relief but I was absolutely buzzing at the same time.\u201d When a jockey makes a winning comeback, punters tend to suspect it is the result of a long and cunning plan, but Shoemark says he had expected to be making his return at Doncaster on Saturday. \u201cI was only swapped over to go to Lingfield at the last minute. Someone was looking down on me. \u201cIt feels really normal again. When I went racing again at Nottingham the next day, it was like I hadn\u2019t ever been away. Everyone\u2019s been great, coming up and shaking my hand. I\u2019ve had a lot of support.\u201d Shoemark is now fully back in the old routine, riding at Wolverhampton on Monday and Lingfield on Tuesday night. Wednesday will take him to Kempton, Thursday requires a journey up to Ripon. \u201cCharlie\u2019s been fantastic. He\u2019s putting me on the majority of his runners just now. Things are going really well. I\u2019ll keep looking for the next winner.\u201d Hills\u2019s two stable stars, the sprinter Battaash and the Classic winner Phoenix Of Spain, have established links with other jockeys but Shoemark hopes to be aboard other runners for the stable when Royal Ascot comes around. \u201cCharlie always seems to have a lot of runners going to Ascot each year, always a few in the handicaps. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be there but I wouldn\u2019t know what horses yet.\u201d Regular AA meetings are, the jockey says, part of his life now and he finds he is able to fit them into his routine, along with riding out and travelling to the races. \u201cI\u2019m taking everything day by day and enjoying it.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s best bets Shoemark has a chance at Kempton aboard the interesting Penrhos (6.45). A respectable third on both starts at Newbury, in September and then again last month, he can be a bit sharper this time in a more winnable contest. When last seen, he chased home an exciting prospect and a horse who has since won at Pontefract. He\u2019s 8-1 because the market likes Land Of Legends but that one regressed from his first run to his second and Saeed bin Suroor\u2019s yard is not firing like it could be, with two beaten at odds-on in novice races in the past three days. Superb Story (8.15) is really interesting in the staying handicap. You\u2019ll remember him as a County Hurdle winner with Dan Skelton three years ago but he\u2019s unraced for two years and has now joined Harry Fry. This is a long break to overcome but he has been best fresh in the past and he looks very well handicapped on the Flat, relative to his hurdles mark. He has to prove he can do it in this sphere but he did win on the Flat in France as a three-year-old. I\u2019m happy to take a chance on him at 7-1. Moon King (2.35) is napped at 11-8 at Nottingham as he seeks a third win of the year for the in-form Ralph Beckett. At Ripon, Polybius (8.00) is still 16-1 after a couple of significant non-runners. From the David Simcock yard that is hitting its stride, he\u2019ll be sharper for a reappearance run, this is more his trip and the hood comes off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
