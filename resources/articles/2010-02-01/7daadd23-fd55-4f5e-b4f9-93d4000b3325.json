The 40-year-old would have been 15 at the time Blakelock was hacked to death in Tottenham, north London, in 1985 during some of the worst inner-city riots experienced in Britain. The suspect, who has not been named, was questioned for four days in connection with the unsolved murder after an apparent breakthrough in the ongoing inquiry into his death. Detectives from the Metropolitan police's homicide and serious crime command reopened the Blakelock murder inquiry in 2003. In the intervening years they have received fresh intelligence and submitted Blakelock's uniform for forensic tests to see if any DNA could be extracted from it. But it is understood the latest arrest is not as a result of a forensic breakthrough. Scientists are understood to have exhausted their tests on Blakelock's uniform and other material without any important evidence emerging. Investigators have repeatedly said people in the area have information about the identity of the killers which they have not shared with police. Police sources said the arrest, last Friday, of the man, who was originally from Tottenham, north London but has moved to Suffolk, was \"significant\". The suspect was taken to Bury St Edmunds police station following his arrest. After being questioned at length he was released on bail today to return to a police station in May. Blakelock, a father-of-three, was hacked to death as police officers were attacked during rioting in October 1985 on the Broadwater Farm estate. The violence erupted after the death of Cynthia Jarrett, who collapsed and died after a police raid on her home in Tottenham. Blakelock was stabbed 42 times when his unit was ambushed during the riot. Another officer, PC Richard Coombes, was also attacked that night but survived. Winston Silcott, Engin Raghip and Mark Braithwaite, were convicted of the murder in 1987 but cleared by the court of appeal four years later over allegations that the police officers fabricated interrogations. New scientific tests meant that Silcott's alleged confession could no longer be replied upon. There were no eyewitnesses and no forensic evidence against the men. Silcott was jailed solely on the weight of an unsigned, uncorroborated statement police took in the absence of a solicitor. Two of the investigating police officers were prosecuted for fabricating evidence but acquitted in 1994. Three juveniles, aged 13-15, were also charged in connection with the murder but the judge threw out the case against them. Scotland Yard would not comment on whether the individual who was arrested has ever been questioned or charged before. Blakelock's widow, Elizabeth Johnson, had been informed of the latest development, police said. Yard officers have spent years sifting through 10,000 statements and resubmitting exhibits for forensic testing in an attempt to find a breakthrough in the case. In 2004 specialist officers excavated a rear garden at an address in Tottenham, believing crucial evidence was buried there. Police launched a fresh appeal in 2005 when they released graphic images of the dead officer's blood-stained overalls which revealed the dark blue uniform was ripped in several places. Detectives arrested a man in 2005 in connection with the murder but he was later released with no further action. Scotland Yard said: \"Officers from the Metropolitan police service's homicide and serious crime command arrested a 40-year-old man on suspicion of the murder of PC Keith Blakelock in Suffolk on Friday 5 February. \"The man, originally from Tottenham, was taken to Bury St Edmunds police station where he was questioned. \"This year marks the 25th Anniversary since PC Blakelock was murdered during the Broadwater Farm Riots on 6 October 1985. \"Police would like to reassure anyone who has information regarding those involved in the murder of PC Keith Blakelock or the attempted murder of PC Richard Coombes, who was also attacked that night, that they can contact the incident room in confidence on 020 8733 4613.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
