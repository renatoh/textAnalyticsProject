Places with high levels of deprivation such as Liverpool, Blackpool and Birmingham have lost much more of their budgets to prevent problems such obesity and smoking than better-off areas. One pound in every \u00a37 of the \u00a3871.6m that has been cut from Whitehall\u2019s public health grant to local councils in England over the last five years has been taken from budgets in the 10 poorest areas of the country. In contrast the 10 wealthiest places have lost public health funding equivalent to just \u00a31 in every \u00a346. Overall the most deprived areas have lost \u00a3120m while the least deprived have seen their budgets contract by just \u00a320m. The findings are contained in an analysis by the IPPR thinktank of government spending data, looking at which councils have borne the biggest share of the \u00a3871.6m reduction since 2014. It prompted warnings that the trend would widen the already stark differentials in life expectancy between those in well-off and poor areas. People in the latter are already more likely to develop and die from killer conditions such as cancer, lung disease, obesity, diabetes and liver disease. \u201cThese cuts have had the perverse effect of hitting the poorest the hardest,\u201d said Chris Thomas, the IPPR research fellow who undertook the analysis. \u201cThis means the health and wellbeing of the most vulnerable people in our country has been put at risk, and puts unnecessary strain on the NHS.\u201d Councils use the public health grant to encourage smokers to quit, promote healthy lifestyles to tackle obesity, provide sexual health services and treat addiction to drink and drugs. But they have been forced to reduce the number and range of services they provide in recent years owing to austerity-driven cuts to their funding from Whitehall. That has led to a contraction in stop-smoking services, sexual health provision and the number of people being treated as inpatients for addiction. Dr Peter English, chair of the British Medical Association\u2019s public health medicine committee, said: \u201cFundamental flaws in the way the government allocates funds to local authorities for public health ... exacerbates the effects of already damaging cuts and widens health inequalities by hitting the poorest hardest.\u201d Shirley Cramer, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health, said the cuts were \u201cshort-sighted\u201d and urged whoever forms the next government to boost public health spending by \u00a31bn. \u201cContinued cuts in public health and local government funding ... limit access to vital services for the most vulnerable, potentially fuel the rise in preventable diseases, and ultimately compound already unacceptable health inequalities,\u201d she said. NHS England plans to put more than \u00a31bn by 2023 into efforts to promote the prevention of ill-health in the poorest areas to bring down rates of avoidable death as part of its long-term plan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
