As a psychotherapist I am more interested in its psychology. If the charges prove correct, what on earth compelled President Bush's most senior aide to blatantly break the law by \"outing\" an active CIA agent? It certainly would be no surprise to find Rove leaking sensitive information to his buddies in the media. Aides, even senior ones, are employed in order to practice just such skulduggery. And they do not become so important to their political masters by being pernickety about the proprieties. Leaking has always been a minefield, even without grand jury subpoenas and cc'd emails. I know from my time in politics that confidences are betrayed and rules routinely bent and broken in an effort to \"get out the message\", especially in a time of supposed crisis. The simplest form is the anonymous leak. Sensitive papers are really purposefully left on photocopiers to be found by opposition researchers. But with anonymity comes decreased credibility. That is one reason why leakers often resort to direct contact. But you have to really trust your chosen recipient. It's not just explicit discretion - that's usually gladly offered. The story must be written in a way that doesn't finger you. I remember a New Labour mate leaking a story about the Transport Union. The paper needed a photo of a TGWU membership card to illustrate their story. He let them borrow his: in the papers the next day his name could clearly be read. He was sacked within hours. But there is a flipside to hard-earned trust. Politics is a small world and eventually journalists and their \"usual sources\" get linked. Then it becomes obvious who is behind what story. My old boss Peter Mandelson once started cosying up to a journalist, who normally wouldn't have been seen as New Labour. For six halcyon weeks he could slip him stories undetected to the consternation of Westminster. Then they were spotted having lunch, and the secret was out. I now know that blowing your cover isn't down to carelessness or stupidity (though there are often some of both at work). Deeper psychological forces are at work. The frequency with which the briefer makes the headlines is, I believe, down to something that even the protagonists themselves aren't conscious of: a secret desire to be recognised and seen to be important. I have rarely known a back-room boy (or girl) who didn't want to be recognised - not necessarily walking down the street but certainly by their peers. That is why, so often, the spinner becomes the story. Derek Draper Mail@derekdraper.net Mind your language It's time to stand up for 'Strine Australia is currently gripped by a debate on the future of their native tongue, known as Strine, under threat by the rampant spread of Americanisms. Can the \"dunny\" survive the onslaught of the \"washroom\"? Here, one writer fluent in Strine offers his verdict: On ya bike, Seppos*. I don't give a tinkers about your jibber. Not that I reckon you're all gallahs. That Pamela Anderson could horse-and-cart in my swag and I wouldn't chuck a wobbly. But when I'm out the back of Bourke, I don't want some drongo of a tin lid calling me \"Dude\" or \"Buddy\" or \"Pal\". And if I'm at my rubbety-dub in Steak 'n' Kidney, knockin' back a dog's eye with dead horse and sinkin' a tinnie with me china plates, buggered if I'll be shouting Budweisers for some bludging blow-in from Baltimore. Streuth, I'd rather be on my pat in the dunny! You see cobbers, I'm filthy with the States. They're makin' a dog's breakfast of me 'Strine, and I'm gonna kick up a stink about it. When I switch the tele on, I wanna have an Uncle Merv at ripper sorts almost starkers, like in Summer Bay (still, I'll turn it up if I ever get a gander at Alf Stewart in his budgie-smugglers). But, strike me pink, all I'm seein' lately are whingin', in-bred, drop-kicks - like Tasmanians, but with fatter dates - bluein' and screamin' \"Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!\" Where's the \"Oi! Oi! Oi!\"?! The wireless is going down the gurgler, too. Once, I'd hear corkers from the Oils, INXS and, you bloody beauty, Rolf. Now it's some dingbat called 50 cent and Destiny's flamin' Child. What happened to Waltzing Matilda (a rip-snorter about a sheep nickin' tea-leaf who chucks himself in the drink)? Oops, I did it again? If that's culture, it's all gone to the thunderbox. And let's get a bit fair dinkum. Britney's no Kylie. So, true-blue Australians, put down your stubbies and get on your plates of meat quick-sticks - it's time to knock up a plan. Those ratbags in Canberra won't get stuck in, they're a bunch of Barry Crockers. No, it's up to us good, ridgey-didge Ockers to tell those Seppos to rack off. My plan? Sick Rolf on 'em. Once they've copped the wobble-board, they'll be Garry Gonners. Then she'll all be apples again.

In the dock Trial and trial again If hell is other people, perhaps jury service is the hellmouth. Separated from the outside world and, at crucial times, their families too, jurors do not have it easy. Then they have to come to a decision - and even that is not always guaranteed. This week Sion Jenkins was told he may face a third trial for the murder of his foster daughter Billie-Jo. Originally convicted in 1998, his appeal for a retrial was accepted six years later on the grounds that new evidence had come to light. But, thanks mainly to doubts over forensic evidence, the jury was unable to come to a verdict. After the recent collapse of the \u00a360m, 21-month Jubilee Line Extension fraud case, the government began to ask if juries are, in some cases, more trouble than they're worth. But in this instance the more pertinent question seems to be: how many times can one man be tried for the same crime? The answer is that, despite centuries of British jurisprudence, no one really knows. In Jenkins' case, his retrial jury was disbanded this Monday with a view to drafting in a fresh dozen. Juries are expected to reach a unanimous verdict; what makes Jenkins' trial so unusual is that the presiding judge, realising that there was no chance of agreement among the jurors, told them to at least take a majority vote. Even more surprisingly, they then reported back that there was no chance of that either. Perhaps in the hope that he would never work with them again, the judge told them they were retired and exempt from jury service for life. A decision on a retrial has been referred upwards to the Crown Prosecution Service. The CPS is fairly sure that there aren't any statutory limits to how many times you can be tried for the same crime when juries fail to deliver. So long as it is satisfied that there's a case to be made, it will continue to prosecute. \"We just have to decide whether there's a realistic possibility of conviction,\" says the CPS's Ann Collins. \"And we have to think if it's in the public interest.\" Since the public's interest can drift from the crime to the cost after a relatively short period (see Jubilee Line above), the cynical might argue that even the Jenkins trial has a time limit. Rosie Anderson Innovations Drink pink It is probably the best gay fizzy drink in the world. It is certainly the only one. Later this month, Norwegians will be the first to discover the fresh taste of Homo Light, a pink carbonated drink that is out and proud. \"We recommend you drink a half-litre: you will not turn gay, but you will become more tolerant,\" explains \u00d8ystein Mauritzen, the man behind the tipple. \"It is better than a straight drink.\" What is it that makes a drink gay? Is it the colour of the liquid? The flavour inside (in this case pear and passionfruit)? A gay drink, according to Mauritzen, is one that turns you into a more cheerful person, someone who can truly appreciate the good things in life. \"To me, it tastes of summer and happiness,\" says Mauritzen. \"When I drink it, I think, 'Oh my God, the sun is shining, I'm so lucky'.\" Homo Light will get its first outing later this month, at a food fair in Stavanger on Norway's west coast. At the gay stand, two air stewards will serve the bright pink soda with a multi-coloured pasta salad. \"It's a bit of fun, but we want to promote higher tolerance of gay and lesbian people,\" says Mauritzen, whose day job is with Norway's National Association for the Liberation of Gays and Lesbians. \"If you drink Homo Light, you drink acceptance.\" In truth, Norway is already one of the most advanced countries in the world when it comes to gay rights. Civil partnerships have been legal since 1993, while a gay or a lesbian person has been able to adopt a partner's children since 2002. The fact that the chancellor of the exchequer, the Conservative Per-Kristian Foss, has contracted a civil union with his long time-boyfriend barely causes anyone to bat an eyelid. What's more, the power of the pink krone is strong. According to the gay magazine Blikk, 66% of its readers earn more than 300,000 kroner (\u00a326,000) per year. They have mountains of pocket money to spend too, with 58% of their income available after paying all the bills. That's not to say that discrimination doesn't still exist. \"There are cases of young sporting talents who quit early because they can't take the pressure of coming out of the closet,\" says Jon Reidar \u00d8yan, national leader of the LLH. Perhaps a glass of Homo Light is in order. Gwladys Fouch\u00e9"}, "isHosted": false}}}
