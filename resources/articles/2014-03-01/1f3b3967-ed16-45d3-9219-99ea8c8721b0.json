That the final is at Manuka at all tells you all you need to know about a competition pushed to the summer\u2019s margins and a match that was once a showpiece this time of year but is now, in the wake up of Australia\u2019s sensational run, little more than an afterthought. This year, however, it has been been trumped by a Big Bash League that saw six rounds of the Shield jammed into just 42 days between 30 October and 11 December and another four into 30 days after Christmas. And then, of course, there are the other football codes, and indeed American sports too. The AFL\u2019s protracted first round concludes during the final, while NRL enjoys its third and Super Rugby its sixth round this weekend. At the SCG, where the final should rightfully be taking place, the LA Dodgers will take on Arizona Diamondbacks in Major League Baseball. To top it all off, an Australia squad containing six players who would be playing in this match will play Pakistan in the first match of the World T20 on Sunday. In light of all this, and with no more than the Shield\u2019s usual splattering of fans expected, it seems a shrewd move from Cricket Australia to offer free entry at Manuka. For all this, the game itself caps a fine summer of Shield cricket. The finalists, New South Wales and Western Australia, played out a pulsating, fluctuating match at the same venue just last week and possess a number of striking similarities. For starters, both NSW and WA, prior to this season, had fallen on hard times on the field and off, the latter for a decade and a half, the former since its last Shield win in 2007-08. Each possess young sides. The average age of both squads for the final is 25 and only seven players \u2013 four Blues and three Warriors \u2013 have Test experience. Both have made varying contributions to the revival of the national team, NSW through the expected absence of six of the sensational summer\u2019s Test regulars and WA through a certain Mitchell Johnson. Both are staging revivals not dissimilar from the Australian team, with old hands \u2013 Adam Voges, Steve O\u2019Keefe, Marcus North \u2013 shining alongside the country\u2019s best young talent in the shape of Josh Hazelwood, Jason Behrendorff and Sam Whiteman. As a result, both are symbolic of the new-found depth in Australian cricket. Perhaps the most striking similarity, however, comes at the top of each team\u2019s order, where Marcus North and Ryan Carters, at the opposite ends of their careers and with the entire 1980s separating their births, have enjoyed remarkable seasons that few can have predicted. On Wednesday, North was named Shield player of the year, while Carters tied with Queensland\u2019s James Hopes in second place. Both have three centuries, both have undergone reinventions after a difficult 2012-13 and both are red-ball specialists who looked uncomfortable during the BBL. For both, victory in Canberra would represent an appropriate completion of individual and cricketing circles of varying lengths. Carters has been the rock around which the Blues\u2019 batting has been built as they chase a record 48th Shield title. A year ago, studying for an arts degree at Melbourne University, he sat behind Matthew Wade and Peter Handscomb in the Victorian keeper-batsman pecking-order and made just 36 runs in two first-class appearances. In four years, he managed just 11 first-class appearances for the Vics. Now, with his studies following him to Sydney, he\u2019s enjoyed a breakthrough season at the top of the order, without the gloves, scoring 789 Shield runs at 56, kickstarted by 94 and 40 against England in November. The 23-year-old\u2019s simple, uncomplicated batting has caught the eye, of that there is little doubt. His red-ball form has been brilliant either side of Christmas but in between he endured a disappointing BBL, where the 42 runs he scored in eight innings were eclipsed by his impressive exploits off the field. Carters organised Batting for Change a charity that received $1,337 for every six struck by Sydney Thunder. Had the Thunder been a little better at cricket, Carters\u2019s admirable act would have raised more even more than the $30,751 (three classrooms at a school in Nepal) that their 23 maximums managed. As a Canberra native, the Shield final sees Carters return to where it all began after a miserable time in Melbourne and a superb summer in Sydney. As the West\u2019s star has risen, with a BBL win for the Scorchers and a first Shield final in 15 years, so has the form of North, who endured a 2012-13 so dismal that many had written him off for good. Then captain, he was dropped after six Shield games with more ducks than fifties and just 185 runs at 15 (47% came in one innings). A season with Glamorgan, the veteran\u2019s sixth English county, was equally unproductive as he managed a solitary 50 in 10 matches. Heading into 2013-14 aged 34, North\u2019s goose looked cooked. Like Carters, however, a switch to the top of the order produced instant returns, with three tons in the first four matches and a total of 884 at bang on 68. North has been back in the nick that once saw him burdened with that heaviest of albatrosses \u201cfuture Australia captain\u201d around his neck; fortunately, that handsome cover drive is back, as is the swivelling pull shot. Shield victory for North would be deeply fitting on two fronts, both personal and professional. Not only has he been burdened by the tragic passing of his brother Lucas in November but Shield victory would represent the completion of his career\u2019s work. When North debuted in late 1999, WA had won the last two Shields, been finalists in the two before that and won 14 in 32 years. 14 seasons on, a combination of mismanagement, unruly players and misfiring stars has led to a generation of underachievement that make this North\u2019s first Shield final. The Shield has been sidelined to the point that runs in the competition are no longer a pre-requisite for Test selection. In such an unfashionable competition, it\u2019s heartening to see a pair of unlikely cricketers revitalised \u2013 one starting out, the other winding down. As the show rolls round to the capital, one will have the perfect curtain call to a season neither player will soon forget."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
