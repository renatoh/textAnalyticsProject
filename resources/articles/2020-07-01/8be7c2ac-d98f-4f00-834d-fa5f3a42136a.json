PNG\u2019s pandemic response controller, David Manning, said a dedicated isolation unit established in the capital Port Moresby to treat Covid-19 could soon be overwhelmed if current infections trends continue. The largest number of infections are of healthcare workers who have been working in a Covid-19 testing lab, and have been exposed. \u201cThe capacity at the [capital\u2019s] emergency ward for isolation is 70,\u201d Manning said, \u201cand with the current rate of infection per day and using increased testing modelling, this has the potential to be reached by the end of this month.\u201d The PNG government has asked the WHO for help, saying there was \u201can urgent need\u201d for emergency health workers to assist the country in managing a forecast surge in cases, and to administer isolation facilities. \u201cWe are also discussing with the PNG defence force to assist... the health department. We have always said we don\u2019t have adequate facilities,\u201d Manning said. The governor of Port Moresby, Powes Parkop, told Australia\u2019s ABC that the capital faced \u201ca situation that we dreaded, simply because of the impact of the virus and also our capacity to respond\u201d. \u201cWe simply don\u2019t have the capacity, we don\u2019t have enough space in isolation facilities, in the hospital, we don\u2019t have enough medical officers and we don\u2019t have enough equipment,\u201d he said. By global standards, PNG\u2019s known Covid-19 infections remain low - with just 32 confirmed cases, but it has nearly trebled in just over a week - up from 11 on 16 July. There are also significant concerns that infection rates are far higher than reported, because of low testing rates, particularly in remote areas. Manning has conceded, outside of Port Moresby, testing has been \u201cvery limited\u201d. A nationwide testing sweep during the country\u2019s declared state of emergency found at least 300 people with Covid-19 antibodies: it appears they have had the disease and recovered. Covid-19 has been linked to only one death in PNG, that of a 48-year-old woman suffering stage four cancer. Doctors said she died with the novel coronavirus and her death \u201cmay have been complicated by Covid-19\u201d. PNG had gone more than a month without reporting any new cases of Covid, before two major clusters, first at the country\u2019s military headquarters, Murray Barracks, and then at Port Moresby general hospital. Eight of the country\u2019s cases are healthcare workers at the hospital laboratory where tests are conducted, while a further eight are the family members and close contacts of those workers. Prime minister, James Marape, has ordered an inquiry into why so many healthcare workers were becoming infected. \u201cAll healthcare workers are supposed to be equipped and all health facilities have been supplied with personal protective equipment. Something went wrong somewhere and they became exposed.\u201d Marape announced masks would be compulsory outside the home in Port Moresby, a city where more than half of the nearly 500,000 population live in densely crowded unofficial settlements where social distancing is difficult. \u201cThe national government will partner with the national capital district commission and the churches to ensure all our city residents are supplied masks for use when they are moving around,\u201d Marape said. He said officials were \u201cnot playing games or fun, neither politics nor business\u201d and that the global outbreak \u2013 already surpassing 15m infections, and 600,000 deaths \u2013 was \u201crising every day\u201d. \u201cCoronavirus is present in the country, more so our nation\u2019s capital city and we must be careful. It is the most infectious of diseases and can be easily transmitted so all persons living in PNG must join in this fight to stop Covid-19 from spreading.\u201d Manning has also announced new social distancing restrictions under the controversial National Health Emergency Act, which gives the government sweeping powers to restrict movement and activity. The latest tranche has imposed an immediate ban on gatherings of over 100 people, and the closure of all nightclubs and sporting clubs. Religious services are allowed to continue but must comply with health protocols."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
