The work they have done during the first six months of the season has all-but guaranteed Wigan a play-off semi-final spot but, if there is to be any silverware at the end of it, some improvement is surely required in the coming weeks. It should not be forgotten that a heroic defensive effort from Widnes went a long way to earning them their second win at Wigan this year \u2013 most teams do not even win here once \u2013 but the Warriors\u2019 attacking play, or lack thereof, was also exposed on Thursday night in brutal fashion. Questions have lingered about Wigan\u2019s ability to score points this year and here, with a barrage of possession, 20 penalties in their favour and with Widnes down to 11 men at one point, they could still muster only one try. That is a clear indicator that the Warriors have to sharpen up before the Old Trafford run-in. Wigan\u2019s three remaining league fixtures \u2013 they travel to the two sides above them, Hull and Warrington, before a home tie with fifth-placed Catalans \u2013 will now go a long way to dictating whom they face in the semi-finals: as well as whether they can remain in the hunt to finish on top of the pile. \u201cIf we win and the other two lose (Hull and Warrington) this weekend we\u2019re level at the top; let\u2019s be real here, Christ,\u201d said Shaun Wane, the Wigan coach, in defence of his side. \u201cI\u2019m obviously angry and disappointed. I\u2019ve told the players to get ready, we\u2019ll sort this in the morning.\u201d But poor as Wigan were in attack, the Vikings\u2019 defensive efforts were just as influential in the final outcome. Their top-four hopes ended some time ago but two wins at Wigan inside one season confirms that this has been another season of improvement for Widnes under Denis Betts. \u201cThis is a place where you have to fight hard to win; we had 11 men and we turned up for each other,\u201d said Betts. \u201cWe worked hard and it was a great effort. I\u2019m so proud of the players. You look at the team and you look at our character and see what\u2019s there within this group.\u201d They went ahead after 10 minutes when the wing, Corey Thompson, took a magnificent cross-field kick from Kevin Brown to touch down but it was the Vikings\u2019 defence which was the standout aspect of their play all night. To a man they were near-faultless, and they made Wigan pay for yet more insipid attacking play on the half-hour when Thompson again crossed, this time from a wonderful pass from Joe Mellor to make it 8-0. The withdrawal of George Williams midway through that first half did little to aid Wigan\u2019s attacking fluidity, yet even with the half-back returning to the field as the second half kicked off, the Warriors\u2019 frustration in attack continued. Time and again they were rudderless close to the Widnes line, but four sets in succession would finally prove the forerunner to breaching the Vikings\u2019 line as Liam Farrell crossed after an overlap to the left. That looked likely to turn the game on its head but not even an extraordinary run of indiscipline from the Vikings could provide the necessary spark for Wigan to take the lead. Twice the Vikings were placed on team warnings by the referee, Phil Bentham, and for a brief spell they were actually down to 11 men after Connor Farrell was sin-binned in the 10-minute period Widnes were also without Jack Buchanan. Yet the Vikings held out. Ryan Sutton broke from a great Williams pass before Stefan Marsh denied him with a wonderful tackle; John Bateman charged clear late on before losing the ball and after the Warriors rejected two late chances for a penalty which would have levelled the game, their evening was summed up in the final moments as Anthony Gelling hurled a loose pass into touch.
