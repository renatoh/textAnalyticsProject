Hospital bosses say that such a massive increase in England is a realistic prospect, given so many people have been unable to have surgery and crucial diagnostic tests in recent months while the NHS\u2019s main priority has been minimising the damage from Covid-19. The total number of people waiting to undergo a procedure in a hospital in England such as a hernia repair, cataract removal or hip or knee replacement stood at 4.4 million before the pandemic. It then fell to 4.2 million because in March GPs referred fewer patients for care to help hospitals tackle the pandemic and also because some patients were reluctant to risk getting infected by going into hospital. However, the NHS Confederation estimates that it is likely to reach 9.8 million by the end of the year as a result of staff shortages and hospitals having to cap the number of patients they can treat at any one time because of strict physical distancing rules that reduce the number of beds available. In a \u201cpessimistic\u201d scenario \u2013 which would result if a second wave of the virus emerges \u2013 the waiting list, comprising people who are meant to be treated within 18 weeks, could hit 10.8 million. And even under the confederation\u2019s best-case \u201coptimistic\u201d scenario about 8.1 million people would be waiting. Any of those three totals would be far in excess of the record 4.5m number of people who have ever been on the referral to treatment waiting list, and they pose problems for ministers. Boris Johnson and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, have made clear that they want NHS services to get back to providing the normal pre-coronavirus range of diagnostic and treatment services as soon as possible now that the worst of the pandemic appears to be over. But the confederation\u2019s chief executive, Niall Dickson, has warned the prime minister in a letter that, while hospitals are keen to restart services, this will take time, partly because of enforcing social distancing in the NHS and also because many staff are \u201cexhausted and traumatised\u201d. He said: \u201cIt will not be possible simply to \u2018switch on\u2019 NHS services.\u201d Dickson cites a number of \u201coperational challenges\u201d, including the need for the new test and trace programme to identify and isolate carriers of the virus to be working well and for NHS personnel to have enough personal protective equipment to be able to work safely while the virus is still circulating. A Royal College of Nursing spokesman pointed out that the NHS in England was short of about 40,000 nurses, adding: \u201cFor burnt-out nursing staff on short-staffed wards, care homes or clinics, it will be a struggle to restart services. The legacy of this pandemic is yet to dawn. The professionals are still focused on the here and now.\u201d Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: \u201cMinisters need to take heed of these warnings from NHS leaders now. \u201cIt is inevitable that the Covid-19 pandemic will impact our health service in the months ahead but it is vital that ministers begin to address this backlog of delayed treatment and rising clinical need.\u201d Steven McIntosh, the director of policy, campaigns and influencing at Macmillan Cancer Support, said action was needed to enable cancer patients to get care. \u201cCoronavirus has created a ticking timebomb of undiagnosed and untreated cancer in the UK, which is leaving many people living with cancer feeling desperately anxious and alone. \u201cWe need urgent action to address the uncertainty of delayed cancer services and prevent coronavirus resulting in a serious spike in cancer deaths. All UK governments must rapidly restore cancer care and deal with the backlog in treatment whilst keeping staff and patients safe during the pandemic,\u201d he said. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cThanks to the hard work and dedication of NHS staff, hospitals were not overwhelmed during the peak of the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cGuidance has already been issued to the NHS on how they should start to restore urgent services in a safe way.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
