Ostensibly, Farah will be talking about Sunday\u2019s Birmingham Grand Prix, where he is due to compete in the 1500m. There are unlikely to be many queries about his form. Instead the questions will centre on whether Farah is about to ditch Salazar, who has coached him to double Olympic glory as well as three world titles since taking charge of his training since 2011. Salazar, who has also been a consultant to British Athletics since 2013, is alleged to have given Farah\u2019s friend and training partner, Galen Rupp, the banned steroid testosterone when he was only 16. Questions will also be asked \u2013 as they have been for days \u2013 over whether British Athletics will continue its relationship with Salazar. Perhaps, finally, we will get some answers. There was at least some welcome directness on Friday from one British athlete, the world indoor 60m champion Richard Kilty, who will be competing in the 100m at Birmingham. Asked directly whether British Athletics should establish some distance between itself and Salazar, Kilty hesitated before answering: \u201cI\u2019ll probably get in trouble for commenting. That\u2019s down to those guys to decide what they want to do. But maybe it would be the right thing.\u201d Kilty also admitted he would be happy if athletes\u2019 therapeutic use exemption forms (TUEs) were made public. \u201cI would have no problem with that,\u201d he said. \u201cI have nothing to hide and I am sure the majority of athletes wouldn\u2019t either. I don\u2019t have any TUEs, apart from seasonal asthma, so I\u2019d be happy.\u201d The UK anti-doping chief executive, Nicole Sapstead, has suggested that such a policy would embarrass athletes who had private health issues unrelated to their performance \u2013 menstrual issues, for instance, or erectile dysfunction \u2013 but Kilty disagreed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think many young athletes would have that problem, maybe a few would be embarrassed,\u2019 he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t got that problem.\u201d Kilty, who has established a reputation for his straight-talking, admitted he had been surprised by the revelations in the Panorama documentary, adding: \u201cYou can\u2019t avoid it. It\u2019s been everywhere. Since the programme you\u2019re getting texts, people ringing and everyone you see is talking about it. It\u2019s unavoidable at the moment.\u201d And so is Justin Gatlin. Kilty shrugged his shoulders when asked about another thorny issue in what has been a difficult week for athletics \u2013 the performance of the controversial American sprinter, who has been twice banned for doping offences. Gatlin stormed away with the men\u2019s 100m in the Diamond League meeting in Rome on Thursday night in a time of 9.75sec \u2013 only 0.01sec outside his personal best set last month at the age of 33. \u201cHe\u2019s flying, isn\u2019t he?\u201d he said. \u201cThe vibe is that no one wants to see him winning.\u201d Kilty, though, is hopeful that athletics can still put on a brighter face in Birmingham. \u201cHopefully there can be some really great performances which will try to blow away the shadow that programme has caused.\u201d But Kilty will face a strong field in the men\u2019s 100m that includes five athletes who have gone under the 10 second barrier in 2015, including the Frenchman Jimmy Vicaut, the American Mike Rodgers and the evergreen Kim Collins. Britain\u2019s CJ Ujah and the European 200m champion Adam Gemili are also in the field. So far 99 men in history have run sub-10 seconds for 100m, but Kilty admits he is unlikely to take the 100th spot in Birmingham. \u201cI\u2019ve had a tough training week,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could happen but my body will be more primed to do that come the start of July. That said, I have run 10.09 already, so who knows? Fast times can happen in that field and I think it will take a sub-10 to win.\u201d Meanwhile, Dina Asher-Smith, who faces the four-times Olympic champion Allyson Felix over 200m on Sunday, said the Fifa revelations showed that athletics was far from alone in its troubles. \u201cEvery sport and every industry has difficult weeks,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you look at football, it\u2019s had a hard week too but at the same time there are millions of football fans that still love the game. I\u2019m still happy, I\u2019m still smiling.\u201d It remains to be seen whether Farah will be too when he faces the camerason Saturday. While there is no suggestion that he has done anything wrong, an abrupt clarity over his relationship with a coach who is now mired in controversy is certainly long overdue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
