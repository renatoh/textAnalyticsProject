He is right to call on us all to challenge this. It was therefore shocking to see Marina Hyde (Of all the hills to die on, why on earth has Labour chosen Chris Williamson?, 29 June) use \u201cslithered\u201d to describe Chris Williamson\u2019s return as a Labour MP. Steve Quinn Salford \u2022 In her piece, Marina Hyde hasn\u2019t written what Williamson actually said: \u201cThe party that has done more to stand up to racism is now being demonised as a racist, bigoted party. I have got to say, I think our party is partly responsible for that. In my opinion we have backed off far too much; we have given too much ground; we\u2019ve been too apologetic. We\u2019ve done more to address the scourge of antisemitism than any other party.\u201d The party is in a state of fear that legitimate criticisms of Israel\u2019s government will cause it to be called antisemitic, and if it defends Williamson it will unfairly be given this most insulting of names. Cath Ryde Bolton \u2022 It\u2019s hard to tell from Michael Segalov\u2019s accusation of \u201ca litany of unacceptable behaviour\u201d by Chris Williamson if the MP is in the dock for an opinion he expressed in Sheffield (shared incidentally by many rank-and-file Labour members), if he\u2019s \u201cguilty\u201d of something else, or if the attack on him is simply part of the anti-Corbyn bandwagon (theguardian.com, 27 June). As a lifelong opponent of racism, I know that I\u2019m not alone in being highly dubious about the regular claims in the media of Labour\u2019s alleged antisemitism problem.
