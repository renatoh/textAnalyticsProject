Ultimately, the Celtic manager gained at least some salvation in otherwise troubled times from a fourth-round Scottish Cup win over Morton. Mowbray's men were far more workmanlike than inspired against a side from Scottish football's second tier, Niall McGinn the player his manager has to thank for averting a crisis. Amid a personnel shortage and a league run which has seen Celtic fall nine points behind Rangers \u2013 who tonight needed extra-time to overcome Hamilton 2-0 \u2013 Mowbray seemed to take solace that a place in the fifth round is secure. \"Cup football is all about getting to the next round,\" he said. \"We managed to do that. We were not as fluent as we have been in recent months but that was never going to be the case; this was a tough match at a tough place for us.\" First Division survival is Morton's main aim this season but they remain one of Scotland's traditionally bigger clubs; the rare visit of a top side to a packed Cappielow was one they were sure to relish. They may harbour a touch of regret that they did not put a shaky Celtic defence under more concerted pressure. Celtic's Darren O'Dea had already been slightly fortunate not to concede a penalty for a tug on Brian Wake's shirt by the time Morton forced Artur Boruc into the first save of the game, 18 minutes in. Defensive woes aside, wastefulness in front of goal has been Celtic's other fatal flaw of late. McGinn, handed a rare start by Mowbray, could hardly be accused of that as he sent the visitors in front with their first meaningful attack, 11 minutes before half-time. Marc-Antoine Fortun\u00e9 was the creator, McGinn fiercely dispatching a cut-back from 12 yards. A tame effort from the Celtic winger Aiden McGeady was the sum of the third quarter of the game, a matter which would surely have boosted Morton. The hosts, though, were patently lacking in attacking punch. The closest Morton came to increasing Mowbray's state of angst was through Wake, whose shot was blocked by Lee Naylor. Georgios Samaras had a Celtic \"second\" ruled out for handball while Naylor volleyed against a post. Neither moment was as definitive as McGinn's strike was for Mowbray's immediate future. For now his attentions can turn to improving his squad, though he played down rumours that Philippe Senderos is on his way to Celtic from Arsenal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
