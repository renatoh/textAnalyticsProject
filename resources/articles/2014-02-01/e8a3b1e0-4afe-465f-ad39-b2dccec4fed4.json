Banners were unfurled calling for Farina to be sacked during Sydney\u2019s defeat to Adelaide last weekend, and the coach had a drink thrown at him by a fan. The players\u2019 union has also warned of legal action after two senior players were excluded from training with the rest of the squad. However, in a blogpost titled \u2018What I\u2019m Thinking\u2019, Farina cited a football career in which he \u201cwon four championships in two countries \u2026 and coached around 275 games\u201d in response to criticism over his leadership at Sydney. \u201cYou might disagree with what I do, but one thing I\u2019m not is \u2018clueless\u2019 when it comes to football,\u201d Farina wrote. \u201cI\u2019m happy to talk about what we\u2019re trying to do \u2013 not that anyone has actually asked.\u201d Farina also responded to criticism of the management structure at the club. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in many clubs and environments in football, and Sydney FC is one of the more professional organisations I\u2019ve experienced,\u201d he wrote."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
