Shevchenko dropped deep or drifted wide in search of the ball but was well shepherded by Micah Richards Bernardo Corradi Manchester City Booked for late foul on Paulo Ferreira and sent off for one on Michael Essien. Half of a pedestrian partnership with Georgios Samaras, but one nice touch put Trevor Sinclair through Ousmane Dabo Manchester City Was sacrificed as City introduced Paul Dickov's much-needed pace early in the second half. His contribution was otherwise limited to being booked for upending Essien 20 yards from goal Mark Gonz\u00e1lez Liverpool Introduced as a first-half substitute and immediately injected some life into Liverpool with his pacy runs on the left flank. Might have scored but slipped at the crucial moment Fabio Aurelio Liverpool Switched to left-back after John Arne Riise's injury and was clearly at home there. Confident, but spoilt an otherwise impressive display by failing to track Rob Hulse for the Blades' goal Didier Zokora Tottenham Lacks Michael Carrick's attacking flair and passing ability but once the Ivory Coast international settles he should help protect the centre of Tottenham's suspect defence. Unlucky to be substituted Dimitar Berbatov Tottenham The Bulgarian striker tended to sit too deep, diminishing his chances of scoring, but had little support. Was given little room by Bolton's new centre-half signing Abdoulaye M\u00e9\u00eft\u00e9 Benni McCarthy Blackburn Blackburn are looking to McCarthy and Jason Roberts to form a telling partnership this season. On this form the former Porto Champions League winner will have to step up his game a little Luis Antonio Valencia Wigan Promising debut from the Ecuador midfielder who turned 21 a fortnight ago. Despite not being fully fit, Valencia was comfortable on the right in attack and defence despite a booking just after half-time Denny Landzaat Wigan Arguably Wigan's best player, Landzaat appears to have immediately acclimatised to the Premiership. Thoughtful in possession, Landzaat was careful but strong in the tackle. Paul Jewell should be well pleased with his 30-year-old recruit from AZ Alkmaar"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
