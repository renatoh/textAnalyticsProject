But yesterday's race was one the Italians, trailing 3-0, could have won. Their skipper, James Spithill, claimed the normally favoured right-hand side at the start and the first wind shift put the Italians in the lead. They moved 100 metres clear but failed to consolidate it by crossing ahead. When the boats came together for a second time Luna Rossa's afterguard decided to tack early, a fundamental error which their tactician, Torben Grael, will long regret. The Kiwis took advantage of the oscillating wind and, once ahead, protected and gradually extended their lead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
