As votes were being counted on Thursday afternoon in the final ballot of MPs for the Tory party leadership, a member of Johnson\u2019s inner circle was upbeat but still on edge. As he paced the Commons corridors he knew Johnson would come top by a mile and reach the final two candidates \u2013 but there was no way he would lower his guard. Asked how it was all going, he replied: \u201cYes, well, thanks. But you never know what can happen next, do you?\u201d With Boris Johnson, no one knows what is round the corner. In campaigning terms he is ranked a grade one liability. Affairs, gaffes, diplomatic blunders have marked his career at every turn. That is why his advisers have gone to such lengths over recent weeks to keep him off the television, and minimise the opportunities for him to commit indiscretions. Since the balloting of Conservative MPs began last week, Johnson has been constantly visible in the Commons \u2013 but at the same time completely off limits for any informal chat. His team have wanted him \u201cout there\u201d and on show but on a leash and silent, except in meetings with those whose support he has sought, behind closed doors. Whenever he has conducted Commons walkabouts of late, Johnson has been granted a personal minder shadowing him on his strolls, often in the person of the former Tory MP James Wharton, a key member of his team. On numerous occasions Wharton has been seen physically tugging him away from potential conversations that might be overheard by a member of the press, or, just as dangerous, someone from a rival campaign. But not even Lynton Crosby, the veteran mastermind of Tory campaigns, who is now advising team Johnson, could have planned for Friday evening\u2019s revelations in the Guardian. The news that police had been called to the flat Johnson shares with his partner Carrie Symonds, after neighbours had rung 999 having heard a row in the early hours, was a real-life campaign nightmare. Despite repeated requests for comment over several hours on Friday, Team Boris were stumped and had nothing to say at all. Shortly before the story broke, the Back Boris press operation had been \u201con grid\u201d, putting out a release of comments he had made to Conservative councillors headlined, somewhat eerily as it turned out, \u201cThe Hour is Darkest Before the Dawn\u201d. It carried parts of a speech he had made saying the party had to improve its fortunes after the low ebb of the local and European elections. \u201cWe can turn this thing round,\u201d Johnson had told his audience. Whether the late-night argument damages Johnson and turns out to be his \u201cdarkest hour\u201d \u2013 and whether he can now \u201cturn things round\u201d and put the campaign back on track \u2013 are now the big questions in the battle for No 10. Too much is unknown about Johnson for any of his supporters to be comfortable. There are issues relating to his private life that are known to worry his campaign team and some of those closest to him, questions about previous relationships, the number of children he has fathered, and even the durability of his current relationship with Symonds. On another front altogether \u2013 the serious business of his programme for government \u2013 plenty of Johnson backers among MPs suspect his plans on Brexit lack depth and credibility and represent little more than \u201ccake and eat it\u201d rhetoric that could be exposed as such in coming weeks. His plans to cut taxes for the best-off have also caused disquiet among some who support him. His biographer Sonia Purnell, who worked with Johnson as a journalist in the 1990s, said the next 48 hours could prove crucial in determining whether the ex-foreign secretary remains the hot favourite among Tory members, or whether the contest turns in favour of Jeremy Hunt. Purnell said she was \u201cshocked but not surprised\u201d by the story about his row with Symonds: \u201cI have seen his temper and I do not want to see it again. It is really quite scary.\u201d A key factor, she told the Observer, would be whether Johnson and Symonds are seen together \u201call smiles and supportive\u201d in the coming days. Yesterday she did not accompany Johnson at the first hustings with party members in Birmingham, where Johnson refused to answer any questions about their late-night shouting match. Purnell says there has been talk among those close to the family that all is not well in the relationship and that Johnson has found it difficult to accept that his marriage with barrister Marina Wheeler, with whom he has four children, is over. Some close to Johnson had worried that he might not be emotionally strong enough to run a leadership campaign, given the recent traumas of his family life. \u201cThere have been suggestions from his circle that he has not fully come to terms or accepted that his marriage is finished,\u201d Purnell said. \u201cThere is also the question of the divorce. We have not heard news of that and there is no explanation of why it has not come through yet.\u201d While Hunt will steer clear of Johnson\u2019s private issues, he can maximise his discomfort subtly in other ways, nonetheless. \u201cIf you want the top job you\u2019ve got to turn up for the interviews,\u201d the foreign secretary said on Saturday. Some of Hunt\u2019s supporters felt able to go rather further. Mark Garnier MP, former minister of international trade, who backs Hunt, replied when asked if he thought his man would benefit from Johnson\u2019s local difficulties: \u201cOn the one hand you think, this is bollocks, people have arguments. My wife and I have ding dongs every now and then like all couples - although the line \u2019get off my fucking laptop\u2019 does make you wonder if she was checking his browsing history (I\u2019m just putting that out there).The other side of this is that he has fucked up on the very first evening. \u201cMy good-natured instinct is that we would not want to capitalise on this, of course not. But you have to say this is the type of attention that Boris attracts. He has the capacity to be front page news for this kind of thing. Obviously I know Boris well, and I would be perfectly happy with him being prime minister, I just think Jeremy would be better. I don\u2019t want to get into an argy-bargy about his character. We want to win this on policy.\u201d On Saturday the pro-Johnson lobby was out in force, arguing that Johnson\u2019s and Symonds\u2019s neighbours who leaked the story of the row to the Guardian were politically motivated and that Tory members in the shires would see that the whole fuss was about nothing more than a red wine induced tiff, whipped up deliberately by \u201clefties\u201d. A Tory MP who does not back Johnson said he feared that, as usual, he would ride the story out and that his backers would somehow turn it to his advantage. \u201cIf Boris was not acceptable to Conservatives we would know by now. You can never be sure but I don\u2019t think a row with his partner will harm him when no end of far worse things have not.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
