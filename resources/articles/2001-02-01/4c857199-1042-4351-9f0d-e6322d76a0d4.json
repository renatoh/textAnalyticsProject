Consider also the Michael Owen goals that earned England draws against Brazil and France in between. The very thought of his being ignored by club or country might seem ridiculous. Yet two months past his 21st birthday Owen finds himself guaranteed nothing. Neither at Anfield nor with England can he count on a place in the side. Forced to watch from the bench as Liverpool, led by Emile Heskey and Robbie Fowler, won the Worthington Cup on Sunday, he can expect more of the same against Spain tonight. Even more galling, Heskey and Fowler are blocking his path again. On the basis of statistics he should be the first forward on Sven-Goran Eriksson's team-sheet. His strike rate of a goal every three games for England (from 24 caps) is matched in this squad only by Paul Scholes and is beaten by no one. Andy Cole and Kevin Phillips have yet to find the net for their country; Heskey has one goal from 11 internationals, Fowler three from 15. With Eriksson having announced yesterday that he will play with split strikers, Owen's chances of starting look slim. He was relegated to the bench when Kevin Keegan played Teddy Sheringham behind Cole in France last September, coming on to equalise. It is pace, direct running and instinctive finishing which mark Owen out, more than an ability to hold play up and work with his back to goal. But he feels he can adapt to whatever Eriksson requires. \"You have got to be ready for any system,\" he says. \"He has said he prefers a back four and it could be fighting for one place or it could be fighting for two. \"I don't think many teams in the Premiership play with two out-and-out strikers. At Liverpool one of us has always got to drift off, so a striker could play in that position in behind as well.\" As a fierce competitor who cannot sit still for more than half an hour and almost never watches a film all the way through, being stuck on the bench must be unbearable. With G\u00e9rard Houllier's rotation system, though, he is there regularly at Liverpool. In the squad 30 times this season, he has played all through only six games. Three days after his match-winning brace in Rome he found himself back on the bench for Liverpool, and despite missing from the spot against Roma at Anfield he craved to be part of the shoot-out and all that went before in Cardiff. \"Football's like that,\" he says. \"You're on top of the world one minute and not playing the next. Emile Heskey was the opposite way round: he never played in Rome and played in the final. Obviously I wanted to play on Sunday but I've played in some big games and missed some, and so has everyone else.\" What he did not miss were the Worthington Cup celebrations: \"At the hotel we had a buffet and a bit of a disco. It was the first thing most of us have won so it was a good night.\" Owen feels he is coming back to his best after having his season interrupted by a freak head injury in October. Before that he had scored eight goals in 11 games, and the self-belief remains undented. \"If I'm fit and training every day,\" he says, \"I've no doubt I will be in the Liverpool team and playing for England.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
