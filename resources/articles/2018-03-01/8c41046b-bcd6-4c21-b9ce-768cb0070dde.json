But there\u2019s no time to take it! The referee blows up for full time: Vincenzo Montella and Wissam Ben Yedder have done a number on Jose Mourinho and a very ponderous United. Expect questions to be asked about United\u2019s approach to this tie over both legs. They weren\u2019t at the races at all tonight. Mourinho walks off, a study in frustration and disappointment. But take nothing away from Sevilla, who performed one of the great smash-and-grabs, and make the quarter finals of the European Cup for the first time since 1958, and for the first time ever in the Champions League era. They were by far the better side tonight, and celebrate on the Old Trafford pitch accordingly. United now have to concentrate on cementing second spot in the Premier League, and taking a tilt at the FA Cup. 90 min +3: Mercado drives down the right wing. Rashford chases him, and clips him over in frustration. A booking, and a free kick that\u2019ll further run down the clock. 90 min +2: Martial crosses from the right. Smalling launches into a diving header. The ball sails harmlessly wide right of goal. 90 min +1: Pogba plays a simple pass out of play on the right. The crowd give him what for. Sevilla go upfield and set Ben Yedder clear! He should complete his hat-trick, but scuffs a dreadful effort straight at de Gea, who kicks away. 90 min: Sarabia is booked for some timewasting jazz. There will be four minutes of added time. 89 min: Correa is replaced by Geis. Sevilla are running down the clock in the professional style. 88 min: Correa chases the ball down the left. Bailly beats him to it. Correa clips him to the floor. That\u2019s a yellow card. 87 min: Rashford flashes a header wide left of the goal from six yards. Rico had it covered. Vazquez is replaced by Pizarro. 86 min: Lukaku makes a nuisance of himself down the inside right. He reaches the byline and fizzes low into the centre. Rashford is there, but Kjaer sticks out a foot and stabs the ball to his keeper. Rico gathers. United want a free kick for the backpass, but they\u2019re not getting it. 85 min: Sarabia crosses deep from the right. Ben Yedder meets the dropping ball just inside the United area. He looks to volley into the bottom right, but sends it miles wide. Mata works hard down the right. His cross is put out for a corner on the left. The set piece is flicked on at the near post by Matic, and Lukaku twists his body to slam a volley home from close range! They couldn\u2019t, could they?! 83 min: Correa is given the run of the left flank again. He strides into the United box and shoots straight at de Gea. 82 min: Chances at either end. From the corner. Lenglet heads inches wide right from the penalty spot. On target, and that was three. United go up the pitch, Mata dribbling hard down the right. He crosses for Lukaku, who hoicks over the crossbar under pressure from Lenglet. 81 min: United\u2019s defence is all over the place as they push forward in desperation. Correa dribbles hard down the left. His low centre finds Ben Yedder at the far post. That would be his hat-trick, were it not for a stunning slide from Smalling. Corner, though. 80 min: United now need three goals to reach the quarters. You could hear the air being sucked out of the stadium as the shock of that second goal hit home. United try to respond, Young swinging a free kick into the Sevilla box from the left. It ends up evading the outstretched leg of Smalling at the far post. Goal kick. Corner for Sevilla down the left. Correa, on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box, flicks it on. Ben Yedder, on the right-hand corner, heads it towards the top right. De Gea tips the ball onto the underside of the crossbar, but comes down and spins over the line. 77 min: Mourinho takes one last roll of the dice. He takes off Lingard and Valencia, and throws on Martial and Mata. 76 min: That\u2019s stunned Old Trafford all right, though the travelling fans are giving it plenty now. 75 min: United now need two goals, or they\u2019re out. We can\u2019t have extra time now. What a substitution! Ben Yedder runs at the Untied defence again, taking possession of a Serabia slider down the middle. He takes a touch to the right, then slams a low shot into the bottom right from 12 yards! De Gea had no chance! 73 min: Ben Yedder comes on for the dismal Muriel. He\u2019s immediately in the action, chasing after a long Sarabia pass down the middle. The ball\u2019s just too far ahead of the sub, and flies through to de Gea. 72 min: The United fans voice a little displeasure with their team\u2019s stuttering performance. Pogba responds by trying a low curler from 25 yards on the right. It\u2019s inches wide of the bottom left, though Rico probably had it covered. 70 min: Correa is sent into space down the left. He can\u2019t get a shot away, but the ball\u2019s worked to Vazquez, who fizzes one low, across the face of the six-yard box. De Gea drops on it like a comfort blanket, with Muriel not really lurking. 68 min: It\u2019s catching. Smalling bundles Sarabia over. A free kick for Sevilla out on the right. Sarabia floats it to the far post. Nobody in black bothers to run for it. De Gea ushers it out with a yawn. Goal kick. 67 min: United load the box. They needn\u2019t have bothered, because Rashford suffers a massive rush of blood to the head and attempts an ambitious whip into the top right. It flies miles over the bar. What a waste. 66 min: Rashford sashays inside from the left and draws a foul from Mercado, just outside the Sevilla area on the left. A free kick in a very dangerous position. 65 min: Pogba\u2019s first act of the evening is a dreadful crossfield pass in the midfield, straight to Correa. Fortunately for United, the visitors haven\u2019t committed anyone else upfield and a quick break upfield is beyond them. 64 min: Old Trafford is quiet, the tension palpable. United stroke it around the middle, but don\u2019t really go anywhere. Lukaku tries to spark something with some determined bustle down the middle, but his team-mates don\u2019t respond. 62 min: Sanchez curls one into the box from a deep position on the left. Lukaku holds off Lenglet and hammers a shot from a tight angle. Again Lenglet takes one for the team to block. The resulting corner doesn\u2019t clear N\u2019Zonzi. 60 min: Fellaini has been decent tonight, but his race is run. Pogba comes on in his stead. 58 min: It\u2019s end to end now. Sarabia bustles down the right and whips a low cross into the United six-yard box. Muriel extends a toe to it, but can\u2019t poke goalwards. Goal kick. Up the other end, Fellaini wins the ball amid a melee outside the Sevilla area. He looks for the top left but the shot is all over the place. 57 min: Sanchez rolls another pass wide right for Rashford, who enters the box and tees Sanchez up. Sanchez cracks one goalwards, but Lenglet spreads himself and bravely takes one in the fruit bowl. What a block! 56 min: Lukaku looks in the mood again. He enters the Sevilla box down the left and diddles Lenglet with a quick pullback and forward burst. He fizzes a low one towards the near post. There\u2019s a slight deflection off Lenglet, but Rico snaffles well at the near post. 54 min: Sanchez sends Rashford skittering down the right with a delicious crossfield pass. Sevilla are light at the back. But then there\u2019s a rare mistake by the brilliant young striker, who shanks a shot-cum-cross out of play for a goal kick. 53 min: Correa dances in from the left, evading three challenges with his twinkling toes. He enters the United box and curls low towards the bottom right. It\u2019s always dribbling wide, and de Gea ushers it out of play without drama. There\u2019s already been more action in the first eight minutes of this second half than the whole of the first. 51 min: Lukaku carelessly loses the ball in the midfield, but makes up for it spectacularly by winning it back and bursting down the right. He slips a ball inside for Lingard, who takes a touch to the right before smacking a low shot across Rico and towards the bottom left. It\u2019s a fine effort, but the keeper gets a hand to it and the ball\u2019s cleared to the left. Rashford delivers it back into the six-yard box, but there\u2019s nobody following up. Much better from United, and fine work by Lukaku. 50 min: N\u2019Zonzi slides in to win the ball over a meandering Sanchez, 40 yards from the Sevilla goal. It looks a fair tackle, but the ref thinks about it awhile, and blows for a slightly generous free kick. Young loops it towards the right-hand post. It\u2019s dealt with easily enough by the visitors. 48 min: N\u2019Zonzi sends Sarabia away down the right. Sarabia curls into the box, and for a second it looks as though Correa is going to take up possession on the penalty spot, on his own! He miscontrols, which allows Bailly to slide in and hook clear as Correa desperately tries to work space for a shot. Vazquez slashes the rebound high and wide. United so close to conceding a vital away goal! 46 min: Correa has a little probe down the left; Lingard has a direct dribble at the Sevilla defence. Neither move goes anywhere special. But it does perhaps show that both teams have been given a little half-time rocket by the boss. And we\u2019re off again! United have only drawn 0-0 after two legs in Europe once in their long, storied history on the continent. That happened in the first round of the 1992-93 Uefa Cup against Torpedo Moscow. They went on to lose 4-3 on penalty kicks. No changes for this second half. The visitors get the party restarted. Half-time entertainment: In which sports marketing executives around the world are given an elegant shoeing. And that\u2019s that, the end of a pretty poor first half. United have been ponderous in attack; Marcus Rashford and Marouane Fellani have been the exceptions to that. Unless one of these teams gets their gamefaces on, we\u2019re 45 minutes away from extra time. 45 min: N\u2019Zonzi has a shy from 30 yards. It flies 30 yards over the bar. 44 min: The set piece is cleared easily enough. Sevilla tear up the other end, United very much on the back foot. Muriel has the opportunity to release Correa into the box down the left, but clanks a dreadful pass straight at Smalling. Muriel has been awful in both legs. 43 min: Rashford slips a lovely ball down the inside-right channel to release Lingard into the Sevilla area. His low cross is deflected out for a corner. 41 min: Fellaini\u2019s at it again, winning a ball down the left and setting Young off into space. Young\u2019s cross breaks back to Fellaini, who nearly bursts the ball while shooting from the edge of the box. Banega bravely gets in the way, and the pressure\u2019s released on Sevilla as Lingard clumsily kicks the leg of Escudero instead of the ball. 39 min: The corner isn\u2019t all that. Sevilla clear the danger. Say what you will about Fellaini, his street hustle nearly led to the opening goal in this tie, and really got the crowd going. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a bit of old-school determination sometimes. 38 min: United finally work the Sevilla keeper! Fellaini barges Escudero off the ball, 30 yards from goal. He turns, one-twos with Sanchez, and breaks into the area. He\u2019s got space on the left, and smashes a rising shot towards the top-left corner. Rico gets a strong hand to the ball, turning it round the post for a corner. 36 min: Sanchez once again tries to get something going down the left. He sails a high ball into the area, but that\u2019s easy pickings for Rico. 35 min: Banega shoots from distance. He\u2019s looking for the top-right corner of the goal; he finds the top-right corner of the stand. The home fans weren\u2019t particularly happy that the United midfield seemed happy to let Banega chance his arm. Not much in the way of closing down going on. 33 min: Lingard loops the ball from the left to Fellaini, just inside the Sevilla box on the right. The big man wins his header, and flashes the ball into the mixer, but there\u2019s nobody in red there. Sevilla go up the other end, Muriel romping in from the left, shoogling his hips, and sending a weak dribbler into the arms of de Gea. That\u2019s an awful shot from a good position; it\u2019s also the first shot on target tonight. 31 min: Rashford skates past Escudero and Banega with some lovely ball-glued-to-toe skill down the right. He eventually runs into trouble, but what a fine high-speed dribble, one that got the Old Trafford crowd on its feet. What a talent Rashford is. 29 min: Muriel\u2019s near miss has shocked United into action. Rashford very nearly releases Lukaku into the area with a long precision pass down the inside right; not quite. Then Sanchez dribbles in from the left but can\u2019t set a team-mate up on the edge of the area. 27 min: Banega nearly opens United up with a clever sliderule pass down the inside-left channel. He\u2019s trying to release Vazquez into the area, but Correa gets in the way and flicks it out of his team-mate\u2019s path. Sevilla come at United again, Sarabia bursting down the same channel and slipping Muriel into the area. Muriel tries to curl a low one into the bottom right, but only manages to fire it across goal and out for a goal kick. 25 min: Young cuts in from the left and lays off to Sanchez, who floats a cross to the far post in the hope of finding Rashford. Escudero eyebrows the danger out for a corner. The set piece isn\u2019t anything to write home about. 23 min: Mourinho stands on the touchline shaking his head sadly. It\u2019s a response to a common-or-garden free kick conceded in midfield, but could stand as criticism of this match so far. It could do with a goal all right. 21 min: And here it comes, as Lukaku creams a pass down the right for Rashford to hare after. Rashford reaches the ball and whips it into the centre. The cross is cleared, but that\u2019s much better from the home side, who have been pretty quiet for the last ten minutes or so. 20 min: United haven\u2019t been rocking, exactly, but their passes haven\u2019t been sticking or flying with any fizz. They take a couple of minutes to stroke it around the back and take a little of the wind from Sevilla\u2019s sail. It\u2019s good game management. It just needs something in attack now to give the crowd some voice. 18 min: Sevilla are in the ascendancy right now. They\u2019ve enjoyed 55% of possession so far, which only tells a story if you factor in their slow start, but still. 16 min: Sevilla are getting used to taking potshots at the United goal now. Vazquez has another whack; another ball flies high into the Stretford End. \u201cI see Jose has gone for that classic tactic on a big European night and quietened the crowd,\u201d quips Gary Naylor. 15 min: Mourinho is concerned enough with United\u2019s sudden passivity to make his way to the touchline and issue a few bollockings. Sanchez tries to pick up the pace with a dribble down the left but runs into trouble. 13 min: Correa has a shot from distance that is not much more than OK. Then Bailly gifts possession to Sevilla with a dreadful pass straight to Vazquez; Muriel tries to curl one into the top right from the edge of the area but leans back and gets it all wrong. Sevilla have grown in confidence, assisted by some shaky United play at the back. 12 min: Sevilla have worked their way into this tie. Correa busies himself down the left and pulls one back for Vazquez, who shoots for goal, just inside the box. Bailly spreads himself and blocks brilliantly. 11 min: N\u2019Zonzi slides a pass down the inside-left channel for Escudero, who briefly threatens to break into the United box but is eventually unceremoniously barged to the ground by the shoulder of Rashford. Nowt wrong with that, even though Sevilla want the free kick. They\u2019re not getting it. 9 min: The first corner of the match is earned by Vazquez down the left. Banega floats it to the near post, where Correa flicks a header over the bar. Close. That was a decent effort that could have flashed past de Gea were it on target. 8 min: Sevilla haven\u2019t done much so far, but Valencia shanks a simple clearance straight to Escudero, and suddenly United are on the back foot. Escudero should release Muriel into the United box down the left, but clanks a simple enough pass into the nearest red shirt. Valencia breathes out again. 6 min: Banega is booked for a late and fairly crude tackle on Sanchez, who was bursting through the middle. Studs on knee, more clumsy than spiteful, but still. You\u2019ve seen referees get really irritated with that sort of nonsense. But yellow it is, and Banega will miss the first leg of the quarter final should Sevilla make it. Rashford takes the free kick, 30 yards out, and, full of confidence, belts it towards the bottom left. Rico is behind it all the way. 5 min: Sevilla\u2019s fans are giving it plenty, though their team haven\u2019t got going yet. A few passes are strung together in the United half, but Muriel needlessly wanders out of play. United sashay up the other end, Lingard crossing from the left and nearly finding Lukaku at the near post. Kjaer clears. 4 min: United are looking very slick in these early exchanges. Fellaini, Lukaku and Sanchez combine as the ball\u2019s shuttled in from the left, eventually ending up at Rashford\u2019s feet just inside the Sevilla box on the right. He drops a shoulder with a view to cutting back in and curling one goalwards, but is blocked out of it. A brisk start from the hosts. 2 min: Brilliant by Lukaku, who chases after a long ball down the left and bullies Kjaer out of the road. He cuts inside and plays a ball down the inside-left channel for Lingard, who immediately pulls it back and tees it up for the big striker. Lukaku has space to hit the target from the edge of the box, but blazes high and wide right. That was more than half a chance spurned, though to be fair it was all his own work. And we\u2019re off! United get the ball rolling. Sevilla will be kicking towards the Stretford End in this first half. The teams are out! Manchester United wear their world-famous red shirts and white shorts, while Sevilla sport their third-choice black kit. There\u2019s a cracking atmosphere at Old Trafford as you\u2019d expect on such a big European night. The teams swap pennants, shake hands, and engage in pleasant small talk with the officials. Zadok the Priest is butchered by the Uefa bureaucrats. And that\u2019s about that for the Champions League pre-match rituals. We\u2019ll be off before you know it! Jose Mourinho speaks to BT Sport\u2019s Des Kelly, and is asked whether this is the biggest game of Manchester United\u2019s season so far. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I heard so much before we played Liverpool, that in spite of this being a Champions League knockout, that\u2019s the biggest match for the United family. For us as a team, I think so, and again next Saturday [against Brighton in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup] because it is knockout. We win, we go through; we don\u2019t win, we watch the quarter finals on TV, simple. We have a good squad; when people are available we have different options. We believe Marouane\u2019s qualities are important for the way we want to start the game. We have to win, it\u2019s a very dangerous result, the one we had away. I am sure Sevilla will be alive in the tie until the end. I do not see a big result happening. It is a game of huge pressure for both teams. Home advantage played for them very well in Sevilla, and hopefully our people will give us a little push.\u201d Manchester United: de Gea, Valencia, Smalling, Bailly, Young, Fellaini, Matic, Lingard, Sanchez, Rashford, Lukaku. Subs: Romero, Lindelof, Pogba, Mata, Martial, Darmian, McTominay. Sevilla: Sergio Rico, Mercado, Kjaer, Lenglet, Escudero, Nzonzi, Banega, Sarabia, Vazquez, Correa, Muriel. Subs: Soria, Ben Yedder, Geis, Pizarro, Pareja, Nolito, Guilherme Arana. Referee: Danny Makkelie (Holland). United make two changes to the XI selected for the Liverpool game last Saturday. Juan Mata and Scott McTominay drop to the bench, with Jesse Lingard and Marouane Fellaini taking their places. Lingard is the only United player walking a disciplinary tightrope tonight; one yellow card and he\u2019ll miss the first leg of the quarter final, should United get there. Also on the bench, returning from injury: Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial. Some bench United have tonight. Sevilla also make two changes from their weekend line-up. Of the XI named against Valencia on Saturday, Nolito drops to the bench, while Miguel Layun is cup-tied. Simon Kjaer comes into the centre of the defence, while Joaquin Correa will patrol the left flank in the progressive manner. Manchester United may not have been at their sparkling best at the Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n three weeks ago. But a draw away in Europe is a draw away in Europe, and here\u2019s how the prevailing mood music can alter perceptions of a result. Three weeks ago, that first-leg 0-0 came during a stodgy run that included defeats at Tottenham and Newcastle, and few had any kind words to say about it. But now, United are coming off the back of three wins over Chelsea, Crystal Palace and arch-rivals Liverpool, and suddenly seeing off Sevilla at home doesn\u2019t look such a big issue at all. That first-leg 0-0 looks fairly handy now. It should have looked that way from the start, if we\u2019re being honest, because United have won 17 out of 20 games at Old Trafford this season. The only teams to come away with the sort of result Sevilla need tonight are Manchester City, who won 2-1 in early December, and Burnley, who drew 2-2 on Boxing Day. Tottenham, Chelsea and Liverpool have all been dispatched without too much fuss. Any sort of score draw will see Sevilla through, United having failed to get an away goal in Spain, but that\u2019s easier said and done if the Old Trafford form book is any sort of guide. Sevilla aren\u2019t going into this match in the best of nick, either. Since the first leg, they\u2019ve lost a couple of big games at home - a 5-2 thrashing by Atletico Madrid, and a 2-0 reverse to Valencia - that make Champions League participation next season look unlikely. The history books aren\u2019t their friend either: they\u2019ve never made it past the Round of 16 in the Champions League era, their latest failure being last season\u2019s capitulation at Leicester City. And they\u2019ve never won in England. Having said that, they did force a 2-2 draw at Liverpool in this season\u2019s group stage, and that sort of result would be enough to get them over the hurdle this time. The three-time European champions, and reigning Europa League winners, are favourites going into the game. Can they reach their first Champions League quarter-final for four years? Or will the five-time Uefa Cup and Europa League champs make it through to the Champions League quarters for the first time at their fourth attempt? It\u2019s going to be a blast finding out. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 7.45pm in Manchester."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
