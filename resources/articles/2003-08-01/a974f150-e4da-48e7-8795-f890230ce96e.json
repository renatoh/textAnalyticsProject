In response the club's chairman Terence Brown released an official statement, claiming the club had to find \u00a328m in savings after being relegated from the Premiership. \"Those who say we should have shown more ambition and kept the whole squad together [with \u00a330m at stake if we are promoted] need to understand that by November we would have run out of cash and any cheques drawn by the club after that time would have bounced [including wage cheques],\" he insisted. One suspects that will not be enough to stop further demonstrations during the Hammers' First Division match against Sheffield United on Saturday. In the meantime at least West Ham can fantasise about a cup run thanks to their strike force of Jermain Defoe and David Connolly. For 15 minutes they were rampant, racing to a two-goal lead. Defoe scored the first, tapping home from six yards after Bill Turley could only flick Connolly's 20-yard chip on to the bar. Soon afterwards Connolly, given a start in place of Neil Mellor after his weekend tirade, increased the Hammers' lead, weaving through an accommodating defence before flicking the ball home. But then West Ham stopped playing and allowed the visitors into the game. Onandi Lowe's 25-yard free-kick left David James staring at his top corner in disbelief before Connolly settled matters late on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
