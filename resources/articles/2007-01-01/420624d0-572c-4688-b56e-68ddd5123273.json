Executives at British utilities say Gazprom is considering buying minority shareholdings in UK groups Centrica and National Grid in a move designed to thwart any attempt by the London-based companies to ally with competing groups. Centrica, for instance, has been cited as a possible merger partner for Gaz de France. The executives say Russian officials believe a move by Gazprom to buy stakes in European groups would prepare the ground for building up bigger holdings later, or even launching takeovers. Action could be taken by Gazprom in conjunction with long-term supply agreements with target companies. The Russians currently supply 2 per cent of the UK's gas via continental pipelines, but have ambitions to increase this to 20 per cent in the coming years. In the City, it is widely thought that Centrica will clinch a supply agreement with Gazprom before the summer. Analysts say Gazprom could then build up a small stake, in much the same way as Malaysian company Petronas bought 4 per cent of Centrica after agreeing to supply the British with liquefied natural gas. On Friday, Alexander Medvedev, deputy chairman of Gazprom's executive board, said: 'We are not in talks with Centrica's management or shareholders.' But he did not rule out future interest. Russian officials have told executives at British utilities that after President Vladimir Putin steps down, they are hopeful that a new government would be willing to sell down its 51 per cent holding in Gazprom. This would make an alliance or merger with Centrica or National Grid more palatable to politicians, who have been rattled by the willingness of the Russians to use Gazprom as an arm of the state, threatening to cut off supplies to former Soviet republics which refuse to accept steep price rises. Centrica, which reports results next month, is expected to announce double-digit price cuts following steep falls in wholesale prices over the past six months."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
