Good news: the number of graduate jobs offered by the top 100 employers should increase by more than 10% this year. According to the Graduate Market in 2007 - a survey by High Fliers Research - published yesterday, more than 80% of these firms plan to hire at least as many, or more, graduates than last year. Recruitment at the top accounting firms and investment banks remains buoyant, but the fastest growing sectors are in IT and telecoms, with vacancies up by 47.8%. ... while City bankers enjoy the top salaries Researchers also found that the average starting salaries for the Class of 2007 will increase by \u00a31,700 to \u00a325,500. However, a quarter of the surveyed firms expect to offer graduate wages closer to \u00a330,000. You don't need a degree in maths to know where the top earners (law, consulting and oil and energy firms) and where the lowest ( retail and the public services) will be found. But the real high fliers will undoubtedly be in City investment banks. These firms may not publicise graduate packages, but employees could find themselves in the highest tax band. Graduate demand outstrips supply Of course, it can't all be good news. While the increase in vacancy numbers is clearly welcome, researchers have warned that the growth in graduate programmes has failed to keep pace with the huge rise in students going to university over the past 10 years. Some 265,000 (almost 10,000 more than in 2005) graduates are expected to leave university this summer, so competition for some of the most prestigious graduate programmes is likely to be fierce. Some employers said they expected to receive 50 applications for each vacancy. Not only that, more than 90% of the top 100 firms are recruiting graduates to work in London and the south-east of England this year, and less than half have vacancies in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Health service posts still hard to find None of this will offer much comfort to the scores of recently graduated physiotherapists and nurses in England who have yet to secure their first job. This week, the government was accused of wasting a huge resource after the health minister, Andy Burnham, told the Commons that 40% of graduate nurses had yet to find work. He said the situation was improving, but added that the government was \"working with the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy to address local recruitment problems\". The shadow health minister, Stephen O'Brien, said that graduate unemployment levels of physiotherapists stood at 68%, which was \"a waste of nearly \u00a340m on training\". Loans system could improve access to Bar Geoffrey Vos, QC, new chairman of the Bar Council, has promised to do all he can to make the bar more representative of society during his time in office. He told the Lawyer magazine this week that he looked to a loan scheme to encourage poorer students to become barristers - making access to the Bar \"a level playing field\" for all students. \"Since the introduction of top-up fees, students from poorer social backgrounds end up with about \u00a340,000 of debt after completing their Bar Vocational Course, which is an insuperable hurdle,\" he says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
