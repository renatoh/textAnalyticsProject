In 4 Little Girls he explored the church bombings in Alabama that claimed the lives of four young black girls; When the Levees Broke explored the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina that left many in New Orleans asking whether the Bush administration cared if they lived or died. With Michael Jackson\u2019s Journey from Motown to Off the Wall the MO endures, with Jackson\u2019s evolution from child star to solo pinup drawing Lee\u2019s gaze. Format-wise, Lee isn\u2019t reinventing the wheel. He opts for smile-inducing stock footage of Jackson and his brothers becoming the Jackson Five and then managing the transition into the (edgier) Jacksons \u2013 renamed for legal reasons after they left Motown. The story is told by talking heads including David Byrne, Rosie Perez, Philadelphia soul production unit Gamble and Huff, Lee himself, Kobe Bryant and John Legend. Lee reminds us that Michael Jackson as a solo prospect wasn\u2019t the dead cert you\u2019d imagine in the 70s: he was seen as child star whose flame might have burned out. Could this spotty, insecure tween really become a global megastar? It\u2019s that journey from boy to man that interests Lee and he makes the case that there were a few crucial moments in that evolution. The first was his move with four of his brothers from Motown to Epic (Jermaine couldn\u2019t join them as he was married to Motown mogul Berry Gordy\u2019s daughter). That saw them pair with Gamble and Huff, who\u2019d established themselves as the Jam and Lewis of the 70s \u2013 producing hits for the O\u2019Jays, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes and MFSB, as well as developing the \u201cPhilly sound\u201d, which set the template for the decade\u2019s best disco. The second came when Jackson ventured to New York City and spent time in Studio 54, absorbing the dance moves and the music. The third was Jackson himself becoming more confident and outspoken (in a letter he wrote on tour he outlines his desire to become the \u201cgreatest\u201d and to be known henceforth as \u201cMJ\u201d). There\u2019s also the endless work he put into his singing and dance moves, taking inspiration from Gene Kelly\u2019s \u201cstreet style\u201d (and white socks), as well as riffing on the moves of Fred Astaire and Sammy Davis Jr. It\u2019s a point hammered home by Bryant, the former LA Lakers point guard who was the subject of his own documentary last year, and who revelled in his selfishness and control \u2013 he makes the point that many of the greats share that trait, including Jackson. It\u2019s a brazen celebration of Jackson, which unlike Lee\u2019s other documentary work doesn\u2019t look under the hood to tell the whole story and examine some of the more uncomfortable inner workings. The patriarch Joseph Jackson appears, but there isn\u2019t a second spent on his abusive treatment of Michael or his siblings, which drove them to heights he couldn\u2019t achieve himself. Due to the parameters set by the film there\u2019s no time spent on Jackson\u2019s troubled later years or indeed his actual evolution into a global megastar which came with his next album, Thriller. Lee delivers what the title promises, but it feels very much like a film that\u2019s been made to coincide with an album reissue. In a period of top quality, inventive music documentaries (Amy and 20000 Days on Earth, Montage of Heck et al) this feels like late-night BBC4 fare or for those in the US, something Showtime would broadcast \u2013 and indeed the cable channel has bought it and is showing it on Friday 5 February at 9pm ET."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
