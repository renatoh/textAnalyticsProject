Up to that point, we had been talking, affably, about drug addiction, paganism and the likelihood of a volcano in the area blowing any time soon, before moving on to his enthusiasm for Donald Trump. Now he looked at me suspiciously. The question, he knew, contained an accusation within it, as did my follow-up about Hillary Clinton. \u201cI would love to see a female \u2013 a black female! \u2013 be president,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cJust not her.\u201d He was, of course, right to be cautious: I was prodding him to say something deplorable. This man, who must have been in his middle to late 40s, was a recovering meth addict who lamented the death of local newspapers and thought Christianity had a lot to answer for, which is to say he didn\u2019t quite fit into my preconceived notions. Nonetheless, he liked Trump because, he said, \u201che isn\u2019t a politician\u201d, \u201ccan\u2019t be controlled by the bureaucracy\u201d and \u201clooked out for our people\u201d, by which he meant Americans. The only thing he disliked about the president was \u201cthe way he makes fun of people. You don\u2019t have to make fun of people to get your point across.\u201d I can never decide, in these encounters, where the line falls between humouring, pandering and drawing someone out to see how they think, nor to what extent my condescension is readable. It\u2019s a mode I fall into \u2013 a kind of simpering half-agreement characterised by the sound \u201chmmm\u201d \u2013 that, by forestalling conflict, potentially invites someone to keep on hanging themselves while ruling out the possibility of frank discussion. It would be nice, I sometimes think, to be the sort of person who robustly attacks those with differing political opinions, passionately disagreeing with them. But my inclination, at least with those to whom I\u2019m not close enough to be irritated, is to smile and make nice. I do it with cab drivers. I do it with family members who voted for Brexit \u2013 bright smile, \u201chmmm!\u201d \u2013 and with acquaintances flogging what I consider to be wrong-headed opinions. It\u2019s partly laziness. Most of us could go around fighting all day if we felt so inclined, particularly if we spend time on Twitter. I tell myself that the need to win an argument with a stranger is an odd form of narcissism that gets you nowhere closer to learning how other people think. But the nod and smile leaves a bad taste, too. I felt some sympathy for the guy in the hotel, and then \u2013 a sign of the times \u2013 wondered if this amounted to collaboration. \u201cThis is redneck country,\u201d he said sardonically and for a second it seemed as if we had broken the fourth wall to acknowledge the narrow labels we apply to each other. The moment passed and I went back to judging. This person felt weak and admired Trump, claiming him as a tribal affiliate because he aligned with his idea of what it is to be strong. The question of whether his life had improved in material terms under the president was irrelevant. What Trump stood for was all that mattered. \u2022 Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
