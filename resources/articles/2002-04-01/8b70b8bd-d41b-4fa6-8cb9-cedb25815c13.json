Higgins, whose 14 centuries in winning the title in 1998 remains a record for any single tournament, also had runs of 79, 72 and 62 as he drove towards a prospective quarter-final against Matthew Stevens. Stephen Lee, who has won two of the season's previous eight world-ranking tournaments, made significant progress towards a quarter-final against Ronnie O'Sullivan, the defending champion. Lee arrived at his 7-1 overnight advantage over Quinten Hann with a run of 270 points unanswered but for the single red Hann fluked by smashing the pack indiscriminately with his break-off shot in the sixth frame. Breaks of 68, 64, 136 and 73 underlined the possibility that if a new name is to be inscribed on the 75-year-old trophy, it is most likely to be Lee's. Ken Doherty, the 1997 champion, prevailed 13-12 over Mark King on Saturday and expects Stephen Hendry to be his quarter-final opponent, the Scotsman currently leading Anthony Davies 6-2. Peter Ebdon, the 1996 runner-up, closed out Joe Perry 13-7, while the 2000 champion Mark Williams trailed Anthony Hamilton 5-3 going into their session last night. \u00b7 Kelly Fisher won the women's world title for the fourth time in five years by beating Lisa Quick 4-1 to complete an unprecedented grand slam of the women's world-ranking events."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
