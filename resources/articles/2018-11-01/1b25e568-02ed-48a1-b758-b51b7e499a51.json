Renault\u2019s board promoted Thierry Bollor\u00e9 to deputy chief executive to head the company, but said the appointment was only made on a \u201ctemporary basis\u201d in Ghosn\u2019s absence. Ghosn, the head of the Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi car manufacturing alliance, is chairman and chief executive of Renault. He is also chairman of Nissan and Mitsubishi. The actions of Renault\u2019s board stand in stark contrast to those of its partners in the alliance, both of which quickly said they would remove Ghosn from their boards after Nissan said he had understated his income on financial statements. In a statement following the board meeting, Renault said: \u201cThe board is unable to comment on the evidence seemingly gathered against Mr Ghosn by Nissan and the Japanese judicial authorities.\u201d Renault asked Nissan to share all of the evidence against Ghosn \u201con the basis of the principles of transparence, trust and mutual respect set forth in the Alliance Charter\u201d. Bollor\u00e9 had written on Tuesday morning that Ghosn still had the \u201cfull support\u201d of senior executives in a memo to staff published on an internal website. Nissan said Ghosn was exposed by a whistleblower in a development that shocked the automotive industry. A highly influential figure in the sector in recent decades, the French-Brazilian executive forged an alliance between France\u2019s Renault and Japan\u2019s Nissan and Mitsubishi that created the world\u2019s second largest car manufacturer. Ghosn\u2019s arrest in Tokyo prompted calls for his replacement. Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, said Ghosn had to step down from the French carmaker, in which the French state holds a 15% stake, as doubts rose about the ability of the alliance to survive without the unifying presence of its architect. \u201cCarlos Ghosn is no longer in a position where he is capable of leading Renault,\u201d Le Maire told France Info radio. \u201cRenault has been weakened, which makes it all the more necessary to act quickly.\u201d Osamu Masuko, Mitsubishi\u2019s chief executive, said on Tuesday he thought the three companies in the alliance would appoint separate new chairs because there was no executive of Ghosn\u2019s calibre who could take on the combined role. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anyone else on earth like Ghosn who could run Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi,\u201d Masuko told reporters in Tokyo. The split between the alliance partners will raise questions about whether the companies will continue to pursue closer integration. The Financial Times reported on Tuesday that Nissan board members had tried to block a plan, recently pursued by Ghosn, to merge fully. Renault said it remained \u201cparticularly focused on the consolidation of the Renault Nissan Mitsubishi alliance\u201d. Ghosn\u2019s downfall was expected to trigger a battle between Japan and France for control of the alliance, which has an unorthodox governance structure. Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan, while Nissan owns 15% of Renault and 34% of Mitsubishi. Hiroto Saikawa, Nissan\u2019s chief executive, has previously expressed his opposition to a full merger between his firm and Renault. Saikawa appeared to distance himself from Ghosn\u2019s reign in a press conference announcing his arrest on Monday. Bollor\u00e9 is perceived by analysts as a capable replacement for Ghosn at Renault, although it remains unclear if he will lead the alliance. Bollor\u00e9, a 55-year-old French national, started his career in 1990 at tyre maker, Michelin. He joined Renault in 2012, and was appointed chief operating officer in February this year. Shares in Nissan plunged in Tokyo on Tuesday, ending down almost 5.5% and pulling the Nikkei index to a three-week low. Renault shares fell another 1.2%, after losing more than 8% on Monday. Japanese prosecutors confirmed on Tuesday that they are investigating whether Ghosn and another senior Nissan executive, Greg Kelly, understated Ghosn\u2019s income over five years from 2010. They are accused of reporting only half of his actual salary of almost 10bn yen (\u00a369m) during the period. Ghosn is also accused of personal use of company assets. Japan\u2019s public broadcaster NHK reported that Nissan paid \u201chuge sums\u201d to buy luxury houses for Ghosn in four cities around the world. The properties, in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam, were acquired \u201cwithout any legitimate business reason\u201d, it claimed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
