The City manager has a tendency to downplay his side\u2019s chances of conquering the continent. A 12-point deficit to Liverpool had been reduced to nine and Chelsea\u2019s early lead overturned on Saturday when Guardiola drew on context to suggest his champions are outsiders now. \u201cLiverpool look unstoppable,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it\u2019s far away with these numbers. My teams always try but we accept other teams can be better. So [if] we are going to lose the Premier League, we are going to try the next season. It\u2019s not the first time Manchester City in 100 years of history lose the league.\u201d It is a mantra of Guardiola\u2019s that his side are alone in retaining the title in the past decade. He feels expectations are exaggerated. He gazed across the sporting landscape to cite his friend, the Ryder Cup golfer Tommy Fleetwood, whose first win of 2019 came last week. \u201cIt looks like if we won the last two Premier Leagues we have to win seven Premier Leagues in a row, you have to win 200 points every season,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not work [like that] at a high, high level. Tennis players lose games. In golf, Tommy Fleetwood does not always win the tournament.\u201d If Guardiola has been theatrical in his reactions of late, especially the defeat to Liverpool, he is attempting to be philosophical in his title bid. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do it, I\u2019m not going to retire but I\u2019m going to be disappointed,\u201d he said. Guardiola took solace from City\u2019s spirit against Chelsea. It was the second time in November alone that they had come from behind to win. Yet whereas his teams are natural frontrunners who tend to control campaigns as well as games, Saturday\u2019s frenetic effort seemed significant. If it was testament in part to Chelsea\u2019s ambition and excellence, they may have been encouraged by City\u2019s frailties. Kevin De Bruyne remarked afterwards that City are always expected to have 70% possession. They actually registered a record low for a Guardiola team, just 46%, and the policy of playing out from the back threatened to backfire. Once again, they were grateful to the resilient, redoubtable Fernandinho, who produced a goal-saving intervention to deny N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 in a defiant display. Few other midfielders could, at 34, transform themselves into the outstanding available centre-back at an elite club, and if that is an indictment of John Stones and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi, it is proof of Fernandinho\u2019s adaptability. \u201cHe can play there,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cHe was incredible at Anfield. He was incredible today.\u201d Three years ago, Guardiola said Fernandinho could play in three positions; now he could benefit from three Fernandinhos, two in defence and one in midfield. As long as Aymeric Laporte is sidelined, the plan is to retain the Brazilian in defence. \u201cI like Fernandinho in that position, with the problems that we have,\u201d Guardiola said. Managing problems are becoming a theme; it is less about perfectionism than the pragmatism of making do in the circumstances. Already shorn of their premier specialist defender, City now look set to be without their best striker. Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s muscle injury was assessed on Sunday and while he was able to stay late at the Etihad to watch the Copa Libertadores final, the fear is it will sideline him for some time. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good,\u201d Guardiola said. His answer, once again, lies in a Brazilian. While Raheem Sterling could slot in as a centre-forward, Guardiola confirmed Gabriel Jesus will deputise. \u201cHe is going to play there, sure,\u201d he pledged. An extended opportunity could come in a Manchester derby and meetings with Arsenal and Leicester as City may face a defining December without their record scorer. Should Jesus require a role model, he need only look at City\u2019s right flank on Saturday. Riyad Mahrez probably owed his place to a tweet Bernardo Silva posted in September. The Portuguese\u2019s belated suspension allowed Mahrez to sashay through the Chelsea defence for a classy winner. At \u00a360m, the Algerian is a deluxe stand-in, just as Silva was when he helped City to win the league in the injured De Bruyne\u2019s absence last season. Theirs is an enviable, expensive form of adversity but if City face the hardship of finishing second, they promise to do so in the right way. \u201cThis team never gives up,\u201d Guardiola said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
