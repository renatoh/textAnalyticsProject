Even without the Test-match drama, The Oval next week would be an overblown state occasion thanks to Fred's swan song, without the tumult that would greet Mark Ramprakash on the ground from which he has extracted hundreds as routinely as would a dentist teeth in Sweetieland. On rumbles the debate over whether Batsman should take a call from Commissioner Miller and agree to save the world. But there will be no return. It just won't happen. Ever since England's middle order was bowled out in such insipid fashion at Headingley, the knees of the quick-fix sack-'em-all merchants have been jerking away. Their solutions range from the untried and untested at one end of the scale to the very tried and extremely tested at the other. Some advocate recalling Marcus Trescothick for a last tilt but, terrific player that he remains, with an outstanding international record, he is a man with clinical depression who has found peace and \u2013 it is hard to state this any clearer \u2013 really doesn't want to be bothered anymore. It just goes to show how crassly insensitive can be people who would not entertain the idea of inviting, say, a recovering alcoholic to a stag weekend in Riga. So please, get off his case. Ramps is different. It remains one of cricket's great conundrums that the most prolific county batsmen of the modern era, Ramprakash and Graeme Hick, have scored 244 first-class centuries between them but only eight have been in Test matches. It is quirky too that they made their England debut on the same Headingley day 18 years ago, Hick with expectation unparalleled, such had been his scoring while qualifying, Ramps with a great gift and a reputation for intensity and a short fuse. It ought to have heralded a golden age of England batting. But some saw part of the outcome. The late John Thicknesse, of the Evening Standard, struck one of the great bets by saying that Hick would make a century of centuries but no more than six would be in Tests. If public expectation seemed to weigh on Hick, it was his own that appeared to hold back Ramprakash. Both might have benefited from a central contract. The use of sports psychology, mainstream now, was regarded with suspicion almost two decades ago, its use an indication of mental weakness rather than a path to improvement. Rarely did Ramprakash feel able to express himself at the crease. Yet against Australia, the biggest test, he averaged 42. That is not earth-shattering but is better than many. It might have been considerably more, had he had a lower order with the resolve of those currently playing. Certainly he should have been in the last Ashes series in Australia. Elsewhere, on some of the pitches and against some of the attacks encountered by England in recent times, he would probably have been immense. That he is in the frame now though is largely media-driven. Yesterday, even the Guardian leader page had a go. That is more than it would do for Ian Bell. Geoff Miller, the national selector, refused to rule out Ramprakash on the grounds that he has never retired from Test cricket. He probably did so to stop being pestered, but it was not an endorsement. Ramprakash's own PR machine has cranked into action \u2013 he would \"cherish\" the opportunity. An argument says that far from being under pressure, it would be the opposite. Were he to fail, his reputation would not be diminished. Succeed and he would be a hero. But the selectors are in a different position. If he got runs, they would be asked why he had been ignored for so long. If he failed, they would be accused of romanticism and lack of judgment. It is the fear of the unknown that gets them. The final Test of an Ashes series, with all to play for, is no place for a debutant unless everything \u2013 technique, temperament, reaction to pressure \u2013 is apparent. But equally there is no hard evidence that Ramprakash's batting for Surrey is the product of anything other than a massive comfort zone in which he plays at a level well below his own. It may be that he has changed, not least as a result of his reality-show success, where he placed himself in the spotlight, open to potential ridicule, and came out on top. Yet that may seem an odd qualification for facing Mitchell Johnson with the Aussies in your ear. The stakes are too high for a real gamble. I like Ramps a lot and I have always been a great admirer of his batting. I'd love him to play and prosper. It might be argued that he could do no worse. But we are seeking someone to do much better. This just looks too rose-tinted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
