The prime minister\u2019s senior adviser left Downing Street with his belongings in a cardboard box on Friday evening. Lee Cain, Downing Street\u2019s director of communications, was also told to leave. Johnson held a meeting with Cummings and Cain to discuss their \u201cgeneral behaviour\u201d where he is understood to have accused his aides of briefing against him and his partner. The prime minister also accused the pair of destabilising the government in the midst of Brexit negotiations ahead of a crucial phase in talks in Brussels next week, the Financial Times reported. Government sources have denied the fractious talks took place. Cummings told the Telegraph that claims the prime minister had accused him of briefing against him as \u201can invention\u201d and said: \u201cWe had a laugh together.\u201d However, the tenor of Cummings\u2019 dramatic ousting by Johnson will raise fears that the adviser may not display the discretion expected of a former aide. A government insider told the FT: \u201cI won\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s an explosive stunt between now and Christmas.\u201d A colleague of Cummings said: \u201cIt\u2019s not Dom\u2019s style just to quietly drift away.\u201d Conservative officials said Cummings and Cain would continue to be employed by No 10 until mid-December but were expected to work from home. Cummings\u2019 \u201cwork from home\u201d project is expected to focus on Covid-19 mass testing for the next six weeks. Cummings\u2019 theatrical exit on Friday through the No 10 black door, having formally resigned on Thursday, came despite his office being at 70 Whitehall. Downing Street said that Cummings\u2019 departure would not impact Brexit talks. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman, James Slack, insisted suggestions the government could compromise on key principles in the wake of Cummings\u2019s decision to leave were \u201csimply false\u201d. Cummings was widely perceived as the mastermind behind the victorious Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum. Sources told the Daily Telegraph that Cummings told allies that the prime minister was \u201cindecisive\u201d and that he and Cain had to rely on Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, for leadership. Johnson\u2019s allies accused Cummings of \u201ctrying to blame everyone but himself\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
