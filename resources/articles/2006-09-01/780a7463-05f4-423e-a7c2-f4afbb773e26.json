The conventional thing to say on such a landmark date in a child's life is that it seems like only yesterday that it was begotten, in this case by George Bush. Truthfully, though, the day on which this war on an abstract noun came kicking and screaming into the world seems very long ago indeed, which is possibly why the US president attempted to rename it \"the long war\" last year. Though this was an improvement on co-parent Donald Rumsfeld's desire to rebrand it \"the global struggle against violent extremism\" - surely the equivalent of calling it Moon Unit or Apple - the nominal confusion might have precipitated a crisis of identity in the already troubled kindergartener. But then, Dubya has a fairly inconsistent approach to parenting. On the one hand, he comes from the tough love school. It was not all that long ago that the president and his wife were asked by a soft-soap TV interviewer whether he believes in smacking, which, as has been noted, seems a faintly idiotic inquiry of a man who believes in executing people with a mental age of seven. On the other, Mr Bush is the kind of cash-rich, time-poor modern parent prone to seeking self-absolving diagnoses for his progeny's behaviour, and in the case of his unruly five-year- old it is this indulgent approach that seems to have won out. Like so many western youngsters of its age, the war on terror appears to be suffering from attention deficit disorder. Myself, I would long ago have been tempted to dismiss this excuse for its failure as cod psychology, and introduce Supernanny-style routines to curb its most disruptive excesses. Until it had tidied up in Afghanistan, it would not have been allowed to play with Iraq. Similarly, any Iranian outing would have been contingent on the obedient restoration of at least Iraq's basic utilities to the toy box. I realise this is an unfashionably brutal and uncaring approach, and it is entirely to his credit as a forward-thinking creationist that George Bush has rejected it utterly, and instead given the war on terror the political and military equivalent of Ritalin, allowing it a halcyon, glazed-eyed childhood zonked out in front of Fox News, its every whim indulged. And so it is that it approaches its fifth birthday as bloated and unfocused as one of the 12-stone infants one can see throwing tantrums at Disneyworld. Let freedom reign, and all that. Alas, there are those who whisper behind their hands that this child is not right, that its parents should have taken a firmer hand with it, and thus it falls to all lovers of freedom - and indeed those who have had more than a hand in its upbringing - to accentuate its positives. And who better, this weekend, than the rapidly drifting prime ministerial hopeful, Gordon Brown, who this week took to a Scottish lawn for his interview with Andrew Marr, possibly to demonstrate that a few windswept trees will still tolerate being in the same postcode as him. Gordon, as he was at great pains to stress, is completely obsessed with children. Since starting his own family, the chancellor cannot look at a neglected child without feeling it is a \"stain on the soul\", so doubtless every time he passes through one of the PFI hospitals to which he is so blindly devoted, and notices a surgeon having to dash down several floors - as the result of a multimillion-pound design fault - to get to a child in emergency theatre, he whips out the Vanish in the ministerial Jag on the way back to London. But the war on terror is the child with which we are concerned today, and in his chat with Marr, Gordon was at last moved to turn his thoughts to Iraq, an adventure to which he signed up most emphatically, and whose hideous fallout he has hitherto managed to dodge only by a combination of craven silence, disingenuous sleight of hand, and demented posturings in other areas. Unsurprisingly, the chancellor believes that whoever conceived Iraq's economic policy wasn't much cop. \"The lesson of Iraq,\" he explained, \"is that the economic improvements should have been more widely spread across the population.\" Something there to ponder, certainly, for a people whose social justice aspirations are currently limited to not being blown up on the way to the emergency water tap. In fact, listening to Gordon drone on, it has never felt more right that we should still be affecting to lead these benighted nations by example. For some, there comes a point when Voltaire's maxim \"I disagree with what you say but will defend to the death your right to say it\" has been so roundly misused that you scarcely believe in your own right to say it; but only a cynic could have failed to be inspired by statements emanating yesterday from \"friends of Tom Watson MP\". The protagonist of Gordon's hilariously botched coup attempt moved swiftly and edifyingly to dismiss the suggestion that his visit to the chancellor's home on the eve of last week's push featured one syllable of political discussion. The two men had \"watched Postman Pat on a DVD and played with their [three] babies\". Will there come a time, one wonders, when democracy in Iraq is so successful that journalists will not simply be able to operate without fear of internet-screened decapitation, but will be able to pose reasonable questions to two elected representatives, who will in turn have the sublime respect for the voters to pretend that they passed an afternoon captivated by the goings-on in Greendale, pausing only to debate the effect of the Post Office's new size-pricing system on Mrs Goggins' business? One can but live in hope. This, presumably, is the sort of golden democracy for which George and Tony and Gordon are fighting to the death. Or rather not they, but young men and women, and if that bright dream does not crystallise the minds of the off-message insurgents, or whatever they have now been rebranded, then heaven knows what will. Until then, all that remains is to wish the war on terror a happy fifth birthday, and remember that however tricky a child's first years seem, they are nothing compared with what happens when it hits its teens. This week Marina watched Tom Stoppard's Rock'n'Roll at the Duke of York's Theatre. \"An amazingly, compellingly brilliant play. Having cried through most of the second half, and all the way home, I am by no means ready to give my infinitely dispensable view on it, other than to say that I was glad the British journalist character was utterly ghastly. Quite right.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
