On Tuesday Guardian Australia revealed the incident, along with several others, which raise serious concerns medical practitioners could be at risk of further assaults, fraud and unauthorised access to their personal data. In a further case an Ahpra employee who was also a midwife used her access to medical records to look up details of a complaint that had been made against her in July 2014 and then used the information in separate court proceedings. The national health practitioner privacy commissioner and ombudsman, Samantha Gavel, has been examining the breaches after being notified by Ahpra. A spokesman for the privacy commissioner said: \u201cThe national health practitioner privacy commissioner has been made aware of these matters by Ahpra and is engaged in ongoing dialogue with Ahpra. \u201cThe office of the national health practitioner privacy commissioner meets with Ahpra every month where matters such as these are discussed and reviewed.\u201d The response is the first official acknowledgment that the data breaches have occurred. Ahpra declined to comment on a series of detailed questions from Guardian Australia. A spokeswoman said that \u201cWe are not able to comment on individual matters for privacy reasons.\u201d The organisation has been the subject of continuing scrutiny over its performance and is facing a Senate inquiry into its handling of medical complaints sparked by the independent senators John Madigan and Nick Xenophon. Madigan told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe latest revelations about Ahpra add to the growing body of evidence that our national health regulator is out of control. \u201cWhile Ahpra is a classic case of systemic regulatory failure, unfortunately it is not unique. In recent times there has been an explosion in regulatory agencies of this type.\u201d He said these agencies were granted \u201cextraordinary coercive powers\u201d but operated with little oversight. \u201cWe need to look at the multitude of agencies and commissions currently operating, and the extent of their powers,\u201d he said. The vice-president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Stephen Parnis, said any Ahpra staff member who misused privileged information \u201cshould be subject to the full force of the law\u201d. But he stopped short of calling for tighter security on Ahpra databases, or for the security of databases to be reviewed. Database breaches were a result of criminal activity by individuals, he said. \u201cAccessing databases without authority to do so is a criminal offence and requires zero tolerance,\u201d Parnis told Guardian Australia. \u201cAhpra has been in place for more than five years and is subject to incredible levels of scrutiny. It has come a very long way in that time. We work with them closely as, clearly, the medical profession is subject to regulation and oversight by Ahpra and anytime their processes are being scrutinised, we will put in a submission. \u201cThe bottom line here is the data must be kept confidential. We would expect that all the processes of the law are put in place when that confidentiality is breached.\u201d Ahpra was established in July 2010, when medical registration processes in the states and territories were rolled into one national accreditation scheme. The list of health professions Ahpra has oversight of has expanded since then and includes more than a dozen professions including Chinese medicine practitioners, occupational therapists, and chiropractors, as well as doctors and nurses. This regulation of multiple professions has seen Ahpra left managing an increase in applications for registration and a rapid growth in complaints against health practitioners, all requiring investigation. It has, at times, left Ahpra struggling for resources, an issue acknowledged in its annual reports."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
