Not only have their grand stadium designs been scaled down amid a struggle to secure funds for whatever might materialise in Stanley Park in 2011 but the gagging order imposed on Rafael Ben\u00edtez is not as watertight as they had thought. The Liverpool manager left his recent meeting with the Americans acutely aware that further public criticism of their stewardship would end the job he cherishes. It is not a risk he is prepared to take. However, there are limits to the camouflage over a fundamental division between a manager with lofty ambitions and owners anxious to minimise spending while they concentrate on stadium plans for the future. The comfortable trouncing of Portsmouth exposed as much. Here was a victory that illuminated Liverpool's place in the Premier League order under Ben\u00edtez. With an average team performance they convincingly defeated a Harry Redknapp side that arrived at Anfield with the best away record in the division. With a superior display the previous weekend, Liverpool took nothing but d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and despondency from Manchester United's visit. How to remedy this repetitive malaise remains the Liverpool manager's fiercest challenge. Ben\u00edtez's solution revealed why he remains a thorn for Gillett and Hicks, irrespective of the \"misunderstanding\" buried in the Anfield boardroom last weekend. \"The difference when you talk about United and Chelsea is top-class players - all of them,\" he explained, after Fernando Torres destroyed a threatened Portsmouth revival to aid Liverpool's recovery from defeats by United and then, in the Carling Cup, Chelsea. \"Tactically they were more organised. Physically, technically and tactically they are really good and that's a big difference. We know that, if we want to be closer, we have to do everything almost perfectly because there's a big difference. When you talk about spending \u00a320m on Torres, how many \u00a320m players do United have? Four or five. Why do you pay \u00a320m? Because they are players who can change games. If you have one or two and they have four or five, that could be the difference.\" It over-simplifies Liverpool's predicament to suggest money is the only cause or cure for their title aspirations, particularly when compared with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's lack of \u00a320m recruits, but this was a crucial win that came as a result of Portsmouth errors but mostly through ambition in the transfer market. Torres applied gloss to the result and his name to the headlines with his 13th and 14th goals of the season and gave Sol Campbell a more torrid afternoon than any terrace taunts could. Yet another top-price player was more influential, Javier Mascherano, and it is the price of the Argentinian that continues to test the Americans' promise to sustain success at Anfield. Unlike the \u00a326.5m Torres, Mascherano is not tied to a six-year contract at Liverpool and an agreement to complete his \u00a317m permanent signing before last month passed without resolution. The on...#8209;loan midfielder wants to stay on Merseyside but, with his future undecided and rival clubs interested in his rare qualities, Ben\u00edtez can only hope for a deal to be completed. \"I really don't know,\" he said. \"The situation is we are working together on a lot of issues and we just have to wait. It's always better to get it done as soon as possible. We're just waiting. I have confidence he will stay with us.\" After Torres had exploited the absence of the injured Glen Johnson to ravage Portsmouth's right flank and enable Harry Kewell to cross for Yossi Benayoun to open the scoring, Mascherano came to the fore. An interception began the move that finished with a ludicrous own-goal from Sylvain Distin and, after Benjani Mwaruwari had reduced the arrears and unnerved Liverpool, a piercing through-ball from the midfielder resulted in Torres' clinical and invaluable finish for the third. The striker's late volley from a Steven Gerrard header polished an impressive result from an otherwise flat game and atmosphere. It was Mascherano's destructive quality that truly damaged Portsmouth, however, with one flying leap across Pape Bouba Diop reminiscent of a cheetah felling an antelope. \"Mascherano is the kind of player you want as a holding midfielder,\" added Ben\u00edtez. \"He doesn't need to score a lot of goals, just give balance for the rest of the team.\" And a headache to Gillett and Hicks. Man of the match Javier Mascherano Distribution is one part of the Argentinian's game that can still be improved but two assists were a fine complement to a dominant midfield display.
