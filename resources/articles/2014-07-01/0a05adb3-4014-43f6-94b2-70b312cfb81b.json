Early 80s pointers (Musical Youth, the miners' strike) are trowelled on to a formulaic plot: the school's cup final coincides with not just a major exam but Busby's birthday to boot. Cox's guardedly avuncular turn might have sustained a more rigorous endeavour, but the attempt to evoke the trauma of the Munich air disaster is rendered wholly insupportable by the trifling hooey around it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
