Gilligan, the BBC Radio 4 Today programme's defence correspondent, emailed two members of the foreign affairs committee, Liberal Democrat MP David Chidgey and Conservative MP John Ottaway, suggesting they question Dr Kelly about his contact with the Newsnight science editor, Susan Watts. But Mr Davies told the Hutton inquiry he did not see how Gilligan could have known at the time that Dr Kelly was Watts' source. \"I personally believe that it is wrong for any journalist to divulge the source of another journalist's work. I don't know how Mr Gilligan could have done that because he didn't know Susan Watts' source. That puzzled me. Maybe there was a misunderstanding there,\" Mr Davies said. \"I would say Mr Gilligan at this stage was under enormous pressure and perhaps felt the FAC was trying to discredit him as a journalist and perhaps felt he needed to take steps to counter that. \"But, of course, I enormously regret anything that happened at this stage which may have increased the pressure on Dr Kelly.\" The BBC is understood to planning to investigate Gilligan's emails once the Hutton inquiry has concluded and Mr Davies' comments represent the first open criticism of the reporter from the corporation. Mr Davies said he believed Gilligan, the reporter at the heart of the corporation's row with No 10 over whether it inserted the 45-minute claim into its September dossier on Iraq's weapons, was submitting another witness statement to the Hutton inquiry concerning his emails to the FAC. He also said it was \"something the [BBC] director general may wish to look at\". Watts, who gave evidence to the inquiry earlier this month, said the report that arose from her conversation with Dr Kelly, originally broadcast on Newsnight on June 2, differed in important respects from Gilligan's Today story on May 29. Mr Davies said: \"I think the interpretation that individual BBC journalists put on their reports is entirely for them. She's entitled to come to her views. I don't share them. \"In particular I think there are greater similarities between the broadcasts than Ms Watts does but she's entitled to her views.\" The BBC chairman also denied Watts' claim that she was put under pressure by the BBC to tie in her report with that of Gilligan. He said he never noted, and was never party to, any such pressure. \"The BBC was under pressure to ensure the stories were valid and were well sourced and under those circumstances I think it was entirely legitimate for the director of news to press the editor of Newsnight and the reporter on whether their sources were credible,\" Mr Davies said. Richard Sambrook, the director of news, asked Watts if she was willing to name her source but, when she refused, sent an email saying he entirely understood her position. Mr Davies continued: \"There were clear similarities between the two news reports. One was under enormous scrutiny on the grounds of, perhaps, misreporting. \"I think it was reasonable of Mr Sambrook to ask questions about the circumstances to elucidate whether it would have helped him to make a judgemnt on the reliability of the Today report. \"He did not pressurise or bully anybody. Mr Sambrook was under considerable pressure from myself and the director general to ensure these reports were reliably sourced. \"It is fair to say I did regard Ms Watts' conversations as reported on Newsnight as broadly corroborative evidence for Mr Gilligan's report. I did not regard them as identical.\" Mr Davies described to the inquiry how he concluded a meeting with the prime minister on July 7 thinking the BBC should adopt a more conciliatory stance. \"I think we both left the conversation feeling we should put calming pressure on our respective organisations to try to move the decibel count significantly lower and I made steps to do that in the next 24 hours,\" Mr Davies said. He added that on the same day, following publication of the FAC's report, the No 10 communications chief, Alastair Campbell, put out a statement Mr Davies considered to be \"a good deal more measured\" than his public tone had been up until that point. Mr Davies felt the BBC should reciprocate \"with a notable toning down of rhetoric\". The next day the director general, Greg Dyke, addressed a radio conference in Birmingham, where he thanked Mr Campbell for his statement and said the government and the BBC would probably have to agree to disagree. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
