In a report that generally avoided identifying culprits, the Commons public administration committee said there was a general need for Whitehall officials to present statistics in a more reliable manner. \"Producers of government statistics do not always present their figures in the clearest way, sometimes going too far to create a newsworthy headline, when the true story is more nuanced,\" the report said. It added: \"Government statistics press releases do not always give a true and fair picture of the story behind the statistics. We recommend that press officers and statistics producers work together much more closely to ensure that press releases give an accurate and meaningful picture.\" Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative MP and committee chair, said they were given examples \"where the changes in one month's figures, on say trade, or unemployment, would generate the headline, but where the trend over the year, a far more significant indicator, is ignored\". The committee said Jil Matheson, who is the national statistician, \"should raise her public profile to promote statistics and their value without fear of appearing politically compromised\", and that other government statisticians should do the same."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
