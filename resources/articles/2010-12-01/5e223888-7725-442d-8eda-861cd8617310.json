And as this set proves, he deserves a wider audience. He's an impressive singer, songwriter, and a multi-instrumentalist who switches from bouzouki to melodeon, banjo, dulcimer and \"feet\" (he's a good, percussive dancer), and can handle anything from traditional ballads to comic material. Many of the best songs here are bleak, supernatural traditional ballads such as Fair Margaret and Sweet William or The Wife of Usher's Well, in which his no-nonsense storytelling is matched against his solo banjo work. He switches styles for a gently jazz-edged, clarinet-backed treatment of Cyril Tawney's bitter-sweet Monday Morning, a stirring, brass-backed American spiritual, Light from the Lighthouse, or a live folk-club recording of his own witty The Sound of Hohner, an ode to his melodeon that parodies early Simon and Garfunkel. The best track is his fresh, emotional treatment of Byker Hill, the mining song popularised by Martin Carthy and Dave Swarbrick, here treated to a rousing arrangement with fiddle and brass, and new lyrics lamenting the closure of the mines in the 80s."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
