In a televised address from Wilmington, Delaware, Biden told reporters that he would not yet declare victory, but he believed he would hit the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. \u201cMy fellow Americans, yesterday once again proved democracy is the heartbeat of this nation,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m not here to declare that we won, but I am here to report that when the count is finished, we believe will be the winner,\u201d Biden said. \u201cSenator [Kamala] Harris and I are on track to win more votes that any other ticket in history,\u201d Biden said, referring to his running mate, who stood next to him at the podium wearing a face mask. He said only three presidential campaigns had won against an incumbent in US history. \u201cWhen it\u2019s finished, God willing, we\u2019ll be the fourth,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a major achievement.\u201d The race for the presidency remained too close to call on Wednesday afternoon \u2013 a far cry from the landslide that some pollsters predicted. Democrats down the ballot had not pulled off the upset in the Senate they were aiming for, and had not made the gains in the House that had seemed on the cards. The Biden campaign insisted the veteran Democrat appeared on track to oust Trump, as hundreds of thousands of outstanding mail-in votes continued to be counted in key battleground states. In the face of Trump\u2019s false claims of victory and efforts to launch legal battles to the curtail the vote counting, its messaging became defiant. \u201cNow every vote must be counted,\u201d Biden said in Wilmington. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to take our democracy away from us \u2026 We the people will not be silenced. We the people will not be bullied. We the people will not surrender.\u201d Trump\u2019s re-election campaign said it would call for a recount in Wisconsin, which was declared a win for Biden on Wednesday. It also said it had filed a lawsuit to \u201chalt counting\u201d in Michigan, where Biden was also declared the winner on Wednesday, and in Pennsylvania, where counting was expected to last until Friday at least. The Biden campaign began a fresh fundraising effort on Wednesday for \u201cthe largest election protection effort ever assembled\u201d. \u201cTo make sure every vote is counted, we\u2019re setting up the largest election protection effort ever assembled. Because Donald Trump doesn\u2019t get to decide the outcome of this election \u2013 the American people do,\u201d Biden tweeted. If Biden does ultimately emerge victorious, he will probably not have a Democratic-controlled Senate to help move policy priorities into law. As with states concerning the presidency, key Senate races had not been called on Wednesday, but Democrats were on track to fall short of the net three seats they needed to flip the Senate from Republican control in the event of a Biden victory. But the sobering truth on Wednesday was that Democrats were on track to lose seats in the House of Representatives, contradicting widespread predictions that Democrats would reinforce their majority in that legislative chamber. And Republicans looked on track to very narrowly retain control of the Senate. Together, those outcomes suggested two years of legislative gridlock, even with a president like Biden, who has predicted that bipartisan agreements are still in reach. \u201cI think one of the things that Democrats have to pay attention to is that we\u2019re likely to win the presidency,\u201d said Democratic strategist Dan Sena, who ran his party\u2019s congressional campaign arm when Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in 2018. \u201cBut along with that we have now inherited in some ways the similar challenges we had after 2016 without the benefit of going into the election cycle where you don\u2019t control anything. So the lessons have to be both \u2018how does Biden try and unite the country?\u2019 and then \u2018how do we deal with some of the same problems we had in 2016 that we now have in 20?\u2019\u201d Sena pointed to the House Democrats who just lost their seats, noting that they \u201cprobably outperformed the president in their districts\u201d. In other words, the landscape has not shifted dramatically in Democrats\u2019 favor. Hard-fought victories will still be hard-fought. Likewise, Democrats now have to grapple with the reality that in the best-case scenario for them of Biden winning the presidency, all the previous hurdles for legislative or electoral victory will still be there. Similarly, exit polling suggested that Republicans and Trump made some gains among women and Hispanic voters, a warning sign that Democrats did not in fact have a monopoly on those demographics as some pollsters had suggested. \u201cWe inherit the benefits of hopefully winning the presidency but now you also have the same challenges of 16 with \u2018how do you build a larger coalition, how do you defend this?\u2019\u201d Sena said. \u201cAnd what are the lessons that we really need to learn? I think those are going to be some tough questions.\u201d Still, despite falling far short of the loftier hopes Democrats entered election night with, Biden and his team wanted to retain a high sense of optimism. Outstanding states like Wisconsin and Maine were called for Biden on Wednesday, while Nevada seemed favorable for him. The front of the Biden campaign\u2019s website read \u201ckeep the faith\u201d. \u201cYou know how hard it is to beat an incumbent president,\u201d said the former Michigan Democratic party chairman Lon Johnson, stressing an effusive level of optimism. \u201cIt looks like by all measures he\u2019ll have won the popular vote and this\u2019ll be the most votes of any presidential candidate in the history of America. Are you kidding me? I\u2019m not a doom-and-gloomer here. We\u2019ve won.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
