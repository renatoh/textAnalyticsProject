Proposals for a 26,000 capacity stadium to be built alongside a Tesco supermarket were scrapped last week when the developer, Sterling Capitol, withdrew after the council decided to submit the plans to a government inquiry. Now Caisley claims the council has informed the Bulls that it will do no more than the \"bare minimum\" for the remaining 16 years of their lease at Odsal, which will mean the only covered stand will have to close in two years and the capacity will fall to 14,000. \"The record of the council in dealing with one of its prime assets, Odsal Stadium, has been abysmal,\" Caisley said in a statement. \"Instead of steadily improving the stadium year on year and earning income from it, the council has allowed it to fall into disrepair, like many other parts of the city. \"We are now being told that instead of a fabulous new sta dium, which was supposed to be a major plank of the city's bid for Capital of Culture status [in 2008], the stadium will be slowly left to rot and become an eyesore, that its capacity will be reduced to 14,000 and that the club and its supporters will just have to lump it. It's amazing how this sort of news is always released when the local elections are out of the way. \"Such a course of action could well result in the club losing its Super League status and would certainly cause us to suffer considerable losses, which we would be obliged to reclaim from the council.\" But Ian Stewart, the council's chief executive, insisted: \"We remain committed to finding a solution to the future of the site which meets the needs of the Bulls, their supporters and the regeneration of the area. The council has worked extremely hard with Sterling Capitol, Tesco and Bradford Bulls to make a strong case for the redevelopment of Odsal and we share the disappointment of everyone involved.\" The Bulls have been tenants of Bradford City at Valley Parade on the other side of the city for the past two years, supposedly to allow the redevelopment of the vast Odsal bowl in time to return at the start of next season. Their agreement with Bradford City expires at the end of this season but the Nationwide League club are currently in administration and Abi Ekoku, the Bulls' chief executive, said: \"We don't yet know who the new owners of the stadium will be and whether they will want to share it with us.\" The council has commissioned a report outlining the repair and safety works that will be needed for the Bulls to return to Odsal next year, and will consider it next Tuesday. But Caisley wants further talks with the council \"urgently\". Hull Kingston Rovers, who are still waiting to hear whether Cumbria police will pursue allegations that Alex Godfrey was racially abused in last Sunday's game at Whitehaven, suffered another blow yesterday when their other wing Craig Farrell was ruled out for at least a month with damaged ankle ligaments. Rovers' coach Gary Wilkinson, already looking for two signings to strengthen his squad before the Northern Ford Premiership play-offs, has been linked with the Salford wing Nick Pinkney, who is from Hull. Huddersfield have suffered an unwelcome disruption with their coach Tony Smith being linked with West's Tigers and St George-Illawarra Dragons in his native Sydney."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
