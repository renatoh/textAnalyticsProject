In the fruit-machine world of sprint handicaps, though, your turn tends to arrive if you can only feed the money in for long enough, and yesterday as the St Leger meeting got under way it was a seven-year-old gelding called Halmahera for whom the spinning reels at last fell into place. The punters who backed him down from an early price of 12-1 for the Portland Handicap knew the risk they were taking. Halmahera needs to strike late, which is never easy in a big field of handicappers. Try to force your way into a tube station at rush-hour if you want to know how it feels. From the Stewards' Cup to the Ayr Gold Cup via the Wokingham, Halmahera has threatened to get there but never quite made it. Yesterday, though, nothing crossed his path in the last 100 yards, Darryll Holland roused him for one last effort, and an irresistible burst of speed carried him past Injaaz one stride from the line. \"I have never lost faith in him and I was sure there was a big race in him,\" Kevin Ryan, Halmahera's trainer, said. \"I paid 40,000gns for him at Newmarket last October, and that does not look expensive now. He has been called a lot of names over the years, but never by me and now that he has won a race like this I am sure it will not be long before he does it again.\" It might, in fact, be as little as 10 days, as Halmahera will now go to the Ayr Gold Cup on Saturday week with a 7lb penalty to add to his 8st 5lb in the original handicap. Hill's cut him to 10-1 joint-favourite (with Torosay Spring) for that race, although 14-1 is widely available elsewhere, while Injaaz, who will not be burdened with a penalty, is generally a 12-1 chance. Canada, and the EP Taylor Stakes at Woodbine early next month, is the next appointment in the diary of Alexander Three D, who was another winning favourite in the Group Three Park Hill Stakes over the St Leger trip. The punters' streak continued as Maghanim impressively won the juvenile conditions race over seven furlongs, and was cut to 25-1 for next year's 2,000 Guineas. \"I would think that he would not run more than once more this season,\" John Dunlop, his trainer, said, \"and maybe we shall look at the Royal Lodge and the Dewhurst. I shall also be keen to see what happens when Almushahar, who beat him first time out, runs in the Champagne Stakes on Friday.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
