It's a question supporters all over the Caribbean are asking themselves as they prepare for what would have been unthinkable in the past: losing all four Tests of a home series - and to England at that. In Barbados last weekend I met a lot of very disappointed people. Friends I have known for years looked almost ashamed and many did not want to talk about the situation. Those who did had their own ideas on the reasons for their decline from world champions to the present sorry state. According to who you listen to, it's either the West Indies Board of Control to blame, or team management, individual discipline, the captaincy or even satellite television. To the outsider, it seems likely to be a combination of those factors, plus one or two others. No one single fault but a number of minor niggles and complaints all pulling in the wrong direction and feeding on each other to create a bigger problem. When the team is losing the traditional rivalries between the different islands start to surface. There are suspicions about motives; there is bickering. Certainly, to my eyes, the West Indies board seems to be short of players with Test experience, but how big a factor was that when the team was the best around? The captain, Brian Lara, is also finding his tactics under the spotlight. True, he has made one or two strange decisions in the series, but would even Clive Lloyd have been able to do better in the circumstances. Great captains tend to captain great sides. The only theory I don't agree with at all is that US television has got all the local youngsters interested in basketball and no one wants to play cricket any more. Kids may be spending more time indoors watching the box generally and they also have computer games that were not around a generation ago, but it's the same all over the world and I don't see it having a big effect on the game in Australia. There is no shortage of talent in the West Indies. On paper the two sides in this series were evenly matched: an attacking opener each, three solid and experienced middle-order batsman, four young fast bowlers and no outstanding spinner. The difference has been how England have applied themselves to the task. There can be no better example than Graham Thorpe's century. The West Indies bowling quartet have been impressive, but overall England have shown better discipline throughout the team. They have been more professional and that probably comes from playing county cricket. The great West Indians of the 1970s and 1980s all learnt their trade in England, but of the present side, only Lara has experience on the county circuit, and then only for a couple of seasons. Another accusation is that the present squad don't know the meaning of hard work. While England practice sessions last four or five hours, the West Indies are starting to pack their kit after half that time. There really is no excuse for that. It never ceases to amaze me that teams of mostly intelligent young men can see themselves being beaten by a side that spends twice as long in the nets and still think it's a coincidence. Some of the younger England players were guilty of this in the past, but they are now pulling together more as a unit and seem prepared to work harder to get things right. It's a very promising sign. Taking nothing away from England's performance - that has been excellent - when it comes to training and fitness, the West Indies are certainly missing Dennis Waight, the Australian physio who kept the 1980s team in tip-top shape. Maybe they could do with another outsider to help sort things out now; an overseas coach, perhaps, who could walk in with a clean slate and say: 'Do you want to play for me, or not?' I can see that happening. In the end, though, it is the players who have to carry the can. They need to work hard as a team under Lara. In Fidel Edwards and Tino Best they have promise for the future and, with the right application, the outlook could be very different in a year's time. But I don't see any way they can turn things around before the summer series in England. You've read the piece, now have your say.
