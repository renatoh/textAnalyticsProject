The mission travelled 3.5bn km to get there. Why? (a) It flew twice around Venus, came back to Earth, and visited Jupiter just to get up speed. It still took seven years to get to Saturn (b) The flight path was a daring new manoeuvre: an extended ellipse almost to the orbit of Uranus before swinging back to approach Saturn from its dark side (c) It got lost and had to come back to Earth and start again 2 Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695)... (a) worked on the inverse square law of gravity (b) ground lenses and built pendulum clocks (c) spotted the first moon of Saturn in 1655 (d) all of the above 3 Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712)... (a) was really called Luigi Giuseppe Cassini (b) wrote a treatise on the flooding of the River Tiber (c) spotted a gap in Saturn's rings (d) all of the above 4 Titan is covered in clouds because (a) it is hot and steamy (b) its freezing atmosphere is thick with hydrocarbons (c) as a rocky satellite, it \"drags\" gaseous material from Saturn 5 The Huygens space probe will (a) deliver 80,000 messages and four pop songs to Titan (b) continue touring Saturn's moons for another four years (c) bring back samples of Titanic rock to Earth for laboratory analysis (d) collect three hours' worth of data during its descent, land and then die 6 How many space agencies are involved in Cassini-Huygens? (a) Just one: ESA (b) Just two: Nasa and ESA (c) Nasa, ESA and ASI, the Italian space agency 7 This year, what dogged the landscape of Mars? (a) Beagle 2 (b) a rover (c) two rovers 8 What began 2004 with a dusty encounter? (a) Stardust, which sailed through the coma of Comet Wild-2 (b) Eureca, which vacuumed up micrometeorites in low Earth orbit (c) Lunar Prospector, which crashed into the dust of the moon with the ashes of a famous scientist 9 What will mark July 4 2005 with a bang? (a) A space shuttle launch to head off an asteroid (b) A meteorite called Armageddon that will be a hit on Independence Day (c) A spacecraft called Deep Impact that will blast a hole in a comet 10 What will launch the sail of the century? (a) A Russian nuclear submarine in the Barents Sea will launch Cosmos-1, the first solar sail (b) A new lunar lander on the Sea of Tranquillity will revisit Apollo 11's touchdown site (c) Nasa will send a fleet of Viking probes to Mars 11 What hit Utah with a thump in September? (a) The solar panels of the Russian spacecraft Mir (b) Genesis, with a handful of stuff from the sun (c) The payload from Stardust, back from a date with Wild-2 12 What went up to find if space is really a drag? (a) An Israeli communications package called Dana International (b) A test of Einstein's predictions called Gravity Probe B (c) A British countryside spy satellite whimsically known as Foxhunter 13 White Knight gave a lift to what, and how high? (a) The Red Queen, on her high horse, in a space pageant at Farnborough (b) SpaceShipOne, to 100km and a $10m prize in California (c) Black Arrow, from Woomera to low Earth orbit, to put Britain back in the space race 14 Why must a few European women put their feet up? (a) To simulate a two-month space mission (b) Because they've earned a rest after all that astronaut training (c) Because they really do seem to be different from chaps 15 What made a rare appearance for six hours of daylight on June 8, 2004? (a) Toutatis, the \"killer asteroid\" (b) The Aurora borealis, over the Derbyshire peak district (c) Venus, in transit across the sun 16 What can you say about Sedna? (a) It is ever so small and far away (b) It is the coldest object in the solar system (c) It is a planet. Or planetoid. Maybe (d) One or all of the above 17 What puffed into the moonlight? (a) The Lunar Society of Birmingham (b) A prototype inflatable aircraft designed for silent night flights from Heathrow (c) Smart-1, a tiny test bed for the ion drive, went into lunar orbit 18 What is Swift and why is it looking for something really flash? (a) It's a bright idea by a team from Mensa to capture the new X-prize (b) It's a spacecraft launched to track down gamma-ray bursters, each brighter than a million trillion suns (c) It's a Nasa acronym for something that is neither swift nor very bright: Solar Wind Initial Force Test 19 What arrived by express route at another planet last winter? (a) Europe's Mars Express (b) Europe's Venus Express (c) America's Federal Express 20 The European Space Agency's mission control for Huygens is in (a) Taranto, Italy (b) Darmstadt, Germany (c) Pasadena, California, USA And the answers are: 1. (a) The other two are ridiculous. 2. (d) Seventeenth-century astronomers were game for anything. 3. (c) only. He was really called Giovanni Domenico, and his hydraulic treatise concerned the River Po not the Tiber. But he did spot four more moons and the Cassini division. 4. (b) 5 (a) and (d). It is the mothership Cassini that will tour for another four years. 6. (c) Yes, the Italian space agency is a major player. Other European nations are involved through ESA. 7. Two Rovers. Nasa's Spirit and Opportunity each sent a message back. If Britain's Beagle 2 got there, it sadly remained silent. 8. (a). Stardust flew through the coma of Comet-Wild-2 on January 1. Eureca really happened, but in 1993. Gene Shoemaker's ashes were scattered on the moon in 1999. 9. (c). A Nasa spacecraft called Deep Impact will fire an object into Comet Tempel-1. There was a meteorite movie called Armageddon, but shuttles can only function in Earth orbit. Independence day was a film about aliens. 10. (a) Cosmos Studios and the Planetary Society plan to launch Cosmos-1, the first solar sailing craft, on March 1 2005 from a submerged submarine in the Barents Sea. 11. (b) Genesis should have gently dropped instrument package, to be caught by helicopter. Alas, the parachute failed to deploy. Some of the payload may be recovered, however. 12 (b) Gravity Probe B will orbit the Earth, measuring the distortion of space over the course of a year, as a test of general relativity. Dana International, the drag artist, won a Eurovision song contest. There is no British global positioning satellite. 13 (b) Burt Rutan's SpaceShipOne lifted the weight of three people to the edge of space twice in two weeks. The White Knight and Red Queen are in Alice in Wonderland. Black Arrow put Britain into the space race (briefly) more than 30 years ago. 14 (a) with a touch of (c). European Space Agency doctors want women volunteers to lie down for two months to monitor muscle wasting, bone loss etc expected on a Martian mission. They have some data for men, but mesdames, non! 15 (c) the transit of Venus happens only four times every 243 years. 16 (d) Sedna is an object 800 miles across, and in an orbit up to 84 billion miles from the sun. It was dubbed Planet X, but may be a Kuiper Belt object. 17. We are just giving this one away. It's (c). The Lunar Society of Birmingham hasn't met for 200 years. 18 It's (b). Forget all the others. 19 (a). Venus Express is for another year. Federal Express is still terrestrial. 20 (b) And the winners are: Tim Husband from Surrey and Ian Gordon from Carlisle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
