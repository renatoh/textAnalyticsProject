The west London club, which were at home to Charlton Athletic at Loftus Road yesterday, saw total debts rise from \u00a386m to \u00a3107m last season, according to accounts filed at Companies House. The figure beats Manchester City's \u00a360m liabilities, and even stricken Leeds United's \u00a380m mountain of debt. Fulham, though, may not be set to suffer too badly. It has a rich benefactor in chairman Mohamed Fayed and, while it is planning to return to its Craven Cottage stadium next season, Fulham still hopes to realise \u00a335m from the eventual sale of the club's ground. Pre-tax losses last season fell from \u00a334m to \u00a321m. The club has since sold star striker Louis Saha to Manchester United for \u00a312m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
