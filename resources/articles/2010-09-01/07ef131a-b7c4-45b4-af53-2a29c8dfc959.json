The numbers are much smaller, as the Ofsted report refers to School Action \u2013 the lowest tier of special needs \u2013 and says that as many as half of all children in that tier would not be identified as having special needs if schools focused on better teaching for all children (Half of special needs children misdiagnosed, 14 September, page 1). \u2022 In a story examining the background to the murder of 10 aid workers who were members of the International Assistance Mission, in northern Afghanistan in early August, we said that Tom Little, the leader of the IAM team, was expelled at gunpoint from Afghanistan with other members of the NGO after an incident in 2001. IAM was expelled but not at gunpoint, and without Tom Little, as he was not in the country at the time but returned later. In addition we incorrectly stated that members of IAM had been placed on trial in 2001 for trying to convert Muslims to Christianity, when it was members of Shelter Now International who were put on trial (Soft target? The Christian charity accused of spreading the word, 9 August, pages 6-7). \u2022 We used the wrong picture of a mushroom in yesterday's paper (Fruits of the forest, 16 September, page 7, G2). The photograph was not, as the caption stated, of the death cap, Amanita phalloides but of the false death cap, Amanita citrina. The advice is the same \u2013 don't pick or eat either, as the first is deadly poisonous and the second is horrible to eat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
