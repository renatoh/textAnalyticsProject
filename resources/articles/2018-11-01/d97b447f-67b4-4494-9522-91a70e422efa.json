Denmark had already won the group. It\u2019s 396 minutes since Ireland\u2019s last goal. No wonder they finished bottom. Anyway that\u2019s all from me. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye. That was quite funny. Germany were vastly superior for most of the match and looked to have salvaged some pride after their relegation to Division B, only for the Netherlands to wipe out their 2-0 lead with late goals from Quincy Promes and Virgil Van Dijk, whose equaliser takes the Dutch into next summer\u2019s finals. The Nations League, bloody hell. Has there ever been such a dramatic competition? Virgil Van Dijk\u2019s last-minute equaliser means the Netherlands finish with seven points from four games. They take first place off France because of their superior head-to-head record and will join England, Portugal and Switzerland at next summer\u2019s finals, which will be held in Portugal in June. That\u2019s it! The Netherlands have fought back from the brink and have earned the point that sees them snatch the final spot at next summer\u2019s Nations League finals! 90 min+3: This is hilarious. The Dutch have been terrible. 90 min+1: There will be four added minutes. The Dutch fans, decked out in orange, are finally making all the noise. The Netherlands decide it\u2019s time to go long in search of an equaliser. Virgil Van Dijk, up from the back, makes a nuisance of himself and wins the first header. Hummels heads it away, but Vilhena collects on the right. He makes room for a cross and when it\u2019s flicked on at the near post, Van Dijk\u2019s waiting in the middle to cushion a firm volley past Neuer! The Dutch are going to the Nations League finals! They\u2019ve done it! Incredible! 87 min: Goretzka combines with Reus, who plays a brilliant pass to Kehrer with the outside of his right foot, only for the wing-back to drag a tame effort wide. Leon Goretzka gets caught trying to play out from the back, allowing the Netherlands to press on the edge of the area. De Roon finds Quincy Promes, who shifts the ball on to his right foot before shaping a fine effort to Neuer\u2019s left from 18 yards. The Dutch have at least five minutes to find a goal that would take them into the Nations League finals! It\u2019s not over yet! 81 min: Schulz sees his goalbound volley deflected wide. 80 min: Leon Goretzka replaces Leroy Sane. 78 min: Depay surges down the left, skips round Hummels and lets fly with a shot that Neuer saves at his near post. Corner. 74 min: \u201cHolland are playing this as if it\u2019s a meaningless friendly,\u201d Kari Tulinius says. \u201cSomehow that this is at least notionally meaningful and they seem to have given up with more than twenty minutes to go makes it worse than watching a meaningless friendly.\u201d 72 min: Muller clips a lovely pass over the top to Reus, completely slicing the Dutch defence open. It should lead to a third goal, but Reus\u2019s ball into the six-yard box is behind Sane, who can\u2019t sort out his feet in time. 68 min: Kimmich picks up a booking for dragging back Promes. 67 min: Serge Gnabry makes way for Thomas Muller, who\u2019s on for his 100th cap. 66 min: Diloresen, who replaced the injured Babel, is limping now. On comes Luuk de Jong. 63 min: Marco Reus replaces Timo Werner. 62 min: Germany clear Depay\u2019s free-kick and launch a speedy counterattack, Gnabry releasing Werner. The striker\u2019s through on goal, but he scuffs wide of the left post. 60 min: Tonny Vilhena replaces Georginio Wijnaldum. 59 min: Hummels lose out to Depay, but Sule steps in to stop the striker just inside the Germany area. The Romanian referee sees nothing wrong with the challenge. 56 min: Promes cuts inside from the left and shoots straight at Neuer from 20 yards. At least Germany\u2019s goalkeeper has made a save. 55 min: Neuer decisively punches Depay\u2019s free-kick away. 53 min: Werner tries to run at De Ligt on the left, but the defender stands up and forces the Germany striker to take the ball out of play. 51 min: Kroos pulls Depay\u2019s shirt on the halfway line. That\u2019s a yellow card. 48 min: It\u2019s all Germany. 46 min: The Netherlands get the second half underway. They need two goals to make the finals. But they make a sloppy start, giving the ball away far too easily straight away. They breathe a sigh of relief when Werner shoots straight at Cillessen from the right of the area. That was a good chance. The first half ends with Germany in control thanks to excellent goals from Timo Werner and Leroy Sane. As it stands France will be going to the Nations League finals instead of the Netherlands, who have been a massive disappointment. 45 min: Babel limps to the touchline and makes way for Javairo Dilrosun. 43 min: Sane somehow wriggles along the right goalline, the ball glued to his twinkling feet, but he can\u2019t quite tee up Gnabry. Up the other end, Babel goes down with a hamstring injury. It looks like his night\u2019s over. 40 min: Werner feeds the overlapping Schulz on the left, but Gnabry glances the wing-back\u2019s cross wide at the near post. 39 min: Toni Kroos has been magnificent so far. 37 min: The ball runs to Sane on the edge of the area after a turn from Gnabry. The Netherlands are in trouble again. Or so it seems. Sane\u2019s shot is blocked. Moments later Wijnaldum\u2019s booked for barging into Kimmich. 36 min: Ronald Koeman won\u2019t be pleased with how easy it\u2019s been for Kroos and Kimmich to run the show in midfield. His players haven\u2019t been close enough to them. \u201cNot just the pettiness of getting one over on their rivals that\u2019s at stake for Germany tonight, but also seedings for the Euro 2020 qualifiers,\u201d Simon Cook says. \u201cLose tonight, and as one of the relegated teams with the worst record in the competition, they\u2019d probably miss out on being seeded for the qualifiers, which would make them a dangerous floater in Pot 2.... so to speak.\u201d 34 min: Blind curls in a cross from the left and the stretching Sule, trying to stop it from reaching Depay, steers a header against his own bar and over for a corner. An escape for Germany. They have luck on their side tonight. 32 min: The Netherlands piece together a neat move down the right, prompting Schulz to pull Tete down. Depay\u2019s free-kick is a waste of time, though. 30 min: Gnabry shoots straight at Cillessen from 18 yards. 29 min: De Roon wins a corner for the Netherlands on the right. It leads to nothing. Neuer hasn\u2019t made a save yet. 28 min: \u201cI always loved that Van Basten goal to beat Germany in Euro 88,\u201d Niall Mullen says. \u201cHe always seemed so elegant and totally in control that he made a sliding finish like that into a thing of beauty that has stayed with me for 30 (thirty) years.\u201d 25 min: The Netherlands look shocked at the moment. It\u2019s been a disaster for them so far. They could hardly have made a worse start to such an important game. 23 min: As it stands, the Dutch are totally effed. Under little pressure, Toni Kroos is allowed to look up on the halfway line and send a lovely pass over the top of the increasingly dismal Dutch defence. Leroy Sane\u2019s peeled behind De Ligt, who doesn\u2019t know whether he\u2019s coming or going, and the Germany winger\u2019s allowed to take the ball down, turn and shoot with his left foot from 18 yards. His effort skids off Tete and that\u2019s enough to take it skidding into the bottom left corner, leaving the Netherlands with a mountain to climb. Germany are back. 18 min: The pitch is very bad. The ball is bouncing around all over the place. 15 min: The ball\u2019s on the right of the D. It looks like it\u2019s there for the left-footed Daley Blind to hit, only for Depay to whip a disappointing effort straight into the wall. 14 min: Kroos concedes possession with a poor pass inside his own half. Hummels panics and scythes Promes down on the edge of the Germany area. He\u2019s booked. 13 min: A free kick to the Netherlands on the right, Schulz conceding it. Sule heads De Jong\u2019s dangerous delivery behind for a corner. Nothing comes from it. 11 min: As it stands, France are going to next summer\u2019s finals instead of the Netherlands. The Dutch will finish second unless they score. This is outstanding from Timo Werner! Toni Kroos zips a pass to Serge Gnabry, who flicks the ball on to Werner. The striker struggled so much at the World Cup, but this is a demonstration of what he can do. He nods the ball into his stride and then, with the Dutch defence all over the place, slams a low, bouncing drive to Jasper Cillessen\u2019s right from 25 yards! Germany have the lead and the Netherlands are up against it now. This is a magnificent goal! 8 min: The visitors, remember, don\u2019t need to win. They\u2019re happy enough not to commit too many men forward at the moment. 7 min: Germany try to counter, but De Roon cuts out a long ball to Sane, who would have been away. 5 min: Kimmich advances down the right and finds Kehrer, who wins Germany\u2019s first corner. Van Dijk heads Kroos\u2019s cross away. 4 min: You\u2019ll remember that Germany lost 3-0 in Amsterdam last month. It really hasn\u2019t been their year. 2 min: Germany are playing a back three tonight. Don\u2019t they know England have gone back to 4-3-3? Keep up, lads. Peep! Germany, in white shirts and black shorts, get the game underway. They\u2019re kicking from left to right in the first half and they\u2019re quickly on the front foot, Werner turning cleverly and freeing Kehrer on the right. The right wing-back has space in the Netherlands area, but he fires high and wide. We\u2019ve had the anthems. We\u2019ve had the handshakes. We\u2019ll have some football! The teams are out. Time for the anthems! PREVIOUSLY Germany: Neuer: Rudiger, Hummels, Sule; Kehrer, Kimmich, Kroos, Schulz; Gnabry, Werner, Sane. Netherlands: Cillessen; Tete, Van Dijk, De Ligt, Blind; De Jong, De Roon, Wijnaldum; Promes, Depay, Babel. Referee: Ovidiu Ha\u0163egan (Romania). Hello. Some people say that football is all about glory and honour. Those people are wrong. Because the human race is a terrible species, the unspoken truth is that football is really all about making your enemies as miserable as you are. There\u2019s no problem that can\u2019t be solved by ruining someone else\u2019s fun, just for the sheer hell of it, which is why Joachim Low\u2019s ailing side can go a long way towards repairing their standing in the eyes of the German public by stopping the Netherlands from snatching the final qualifying spot for the Nations League finals tonight. It\u2019s not that beating the Dutch would make all of Germany\u2019s problems disappear at once. This has been a year of unprecedented incompetence for Die Mannschaft. As if crashing out of the first round of the World Cup for the first time since 1938 wasn\u2019t bad enough, now they\u2019ve gone and been relegated from Division A of the Nations League with a game to spare! It\u2019s been quite the fall from grace for the 2014 world champions, whose fate was sealed when the Netherlands beat France on Friday night. This evening, however, they can put all the arguments about their worrying slide to one side. Germany are playing for something more important than pride. This isn\u2019t about finishing 2018 on a high: it\u2019s about the pettiness of getting one over on one of their fiercest rivals. For the Netherlands, the thought of partying on German soil is almost too good to be true. They\u2019re on the up again after missing the last two international tournaments and Ronald Koeman\u2019s resurgent side are a victory away from reaching next summer\u2019s festivities in Portugal. They were deserved winners against France in Rotterdam three days ago, defeating the world champions thanks to goals from Georginio Wijnaldum and Memphis Depay, and a draw will be enough for them to join England, Portugal and Switzerland at next summer\u2019s finals. The only thing that can stop them \u2013 and send France to Portugal instead \u2013 is a Germany win. The potential for immaturity is clear.
