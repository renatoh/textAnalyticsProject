The system, introduced to cricket by Channel 4 last May, is still in development but ITV Sport will use it at up to 80 of its live Nationwide games, the intention being to provide 3-D verdicts of contentious issues. ITV Sport tested the system in match conditions for the first time at last week's Wolves v Liverpool friendly and intend to use it for Worthington Cup and Champions League games. It involves six cameras - one behind each goal and two in each half - and uses technology similar to that used for tracking missiles and guiding brain surgeons' scalpels."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
