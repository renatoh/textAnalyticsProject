The dark\u2011haired boy from Belgrade was two months short of his 13th birthday when he turned up at Pilic's tennis academy in Germany, accompanied by his father and one of his two brothers, ready to demonstrate his gifts to a distinguished coach. \"A friend had told me that he was talented,\" Pilic recalled on the phone from Munich on Monday, less than 24 hours after Djokovic had achieved the feat of beating Rafael Nadal in a clay\u2011court final for the second tournament in a row. \"We started to play, and after a relatively short period of time I noticed that he had an incredible will.\" When they came off the court, Pilic and his wife, the Serbian actress Mija Adamovic, sat down and talked to the boy. \"The answers he was giving surprised us,\" Pilic said. \"He was talking about some guy who was beating him back in Serbia. My wife said: 'Jesus, Niki, he's talking just like you.'\" Pilic, who is now 71, had his own distinguished career on the professional circuit before starting his academy, which has put 40 players into the top 100 in the past 28 years. A tall left-hander, he lost the 1973 French Open final to Ilie Nastase and later became the first man to captain three nations \u2013 Germany, his native Croatia and Serbia \u2013 to victory in the Davis Cup. The most recent success, last year, came with a Serbia team including Djokovic, the conquerors of France in the final. But it was in the preceding round, against the Czech Republic in front of a fervently patriotic Belgrade crowd, that the young man produced a performance typifying what Pilic sees as his extraordinary mental strength. \"We were 1-2 down and he had to play Tomas Berdych. He had a stomach problem and he couldn't even warm up. But he went out there \u2013 in front of 18,000 people, with all that pressure, not feeling good \u2013 and he won.\" Following his success in the Rome Masters on Sunday, Djokovic has now won 39 singles matches in a row and is closing fast on Guillermo Vilas's all-time record of 46. There was another sign of that mental strength in Rome, where he left the Foro Italico after midnight on Saturday, following his semi-final defeat of Andy Murray, before returning a few hours later to beat Nadal, the clay-court master, in straight sets. Ah, Murray. It would be easy to say that Djokovic is everything the Scot \u2013 his friend and contemporary \u2013 has yet to prove himself to be, in other words a player who can translate talent into achievement and become a serial winner at the very highest level. Easy, but not without a measure of truth. \"Andy Murray is a very good player, no doubt,\" Pilic said, \"but he's had a lot of ups and downs. Sometimes he doesn't look like he's enjoying himself, like he's tired of tennis. It could be that Nole [Djokovic] also gets tired of tennis. But I don't think so.\" Perhaps it's easier to retain your enthusiasm when you're winning, although there have been times in the past four or five years when Murray, who turned 24 on Sunday and is the elder of the two by seven days, appeared to be on a faster track to the top. But now the Serb has won two of his four grand slam tournament finals, while Murray has reached three and lost them all. More remarkably, Djokovic appears to have ended an entire era, the one dominated by Roger Federer and Nadal, who convinced the world that they were the best tennis players ever born. He has met them both in finals this year, four times against Nadal and once against Federer, and won every time. If he has done so without sending spectators into the sort of raptures inspired by the Swiss player's creamy inventiveness or the Spaniard's jaw-dropping athleticism, then it is probably worth remembering that his idol was Pete Sampras, whose goal was to play winning tennis. \"Nole was always very coachable,\" Pilic remembered. But Djokovic also had what it takes in the places that no coach can really reach: in the heart, and in the head. Clenbuterol cloud hangs over Contador \"My legs exploded more violently than the [expletive deleted] volcano we were racing up today,\" Mark Cavendish tweeted from the Giro d'Italia on Sunday night. A long, steady climb up the baking and airless slopes of Mount Etna had proved a desperate ordeal for virtually every member of the peloton. Just about everyone, that is, except Alberto Contador, who attacked with 7km to go, lifting himself out of the saddle with that characteristically upright and supple pedalling action, and rode to victory pursued only by the diminutive Venezuelan climber Jos\u00e9 Rujano. It was difficult to know how to feel about the sight of Contador looking like a man on a Sunday club run while his rivals sweated and strained in his wake. Next month, just in time for the start of the Tour de France, Contador should hear the result of the world governing body's appeal against the decision of the Spanish federation to clear him of the test which revealed traces of clenbuterol during his victory in last year's Tour. In the meantime, you rather wish he had stayed at home. Gunners face civil war Alisher Usmanov, the Uzbek billionaire who owns 27% of Arsenal's shares, wants Stan Kroenke, the American sports tycoon who recently expanded his holding to 62%, to allow him a greater say in the running of the club \u2013 something the previous administration firmly resisted. Given the fragile state of the team's morale, there could hardly be a worse time for a civil war to break out at the Emirates Stadium. Assuming Manchester City are about to challenge for a permanent place among the Premier League's top three, with a resurgent Liverpool possibly on their heels, something has to give \u2013 and Arsenal look the most vulnerable. Not my kind of team Every baseball fan knows the Chicago White Sox threw the 1919 World Series at the behest of a gambling syndicate. But now there are suggestions that the Windy City's other team threw the previous year's contest, in which the Cubs lost to Babe Ruth's Boston Red Sox by four games to two. The evidence amounts to an overheard conversation in which a member of the Cubs' roster spoke of the team being offered $10,000 to lose, a series of errors by normally reliable players, and the economic pressures of wartime. Once again, with feeling: say it ain't so."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
