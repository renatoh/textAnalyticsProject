They seemed almost surprised to find themselves doing so, but results are beginning to demand it. Eriksson's Leicester side have now picked up three wins and a draw in four games and have dragged themselves away from the foot of the Championship. Andy King's cracking early strike and Steve Howard's second-half penalty were enough to secure home victory. It takes Leicester to the heady heights of 16th, four points from the play-offs. Granted, only five points separate them from the bottom three, but it is a huge improvement from the rock-bottom position the club were in at the time of Paolo Sousa's dismissal in late September. \"We had to be 100% to beat them,\" said Eriksson, who can now add an East Midlands set-to to his personal list of derbies, which includes those in Lisbon, Manchester, Genoa and Rome. \"If you don't do it, you don't win in this league. It's tough.\" Since his stream of early achievements around Europe dried up \u2013 the Serie A title with Lazio in 2000 is his most recent honour \u2013 Eriksson has at least developed an ability to land on his feet. A difficult spell at Notts County was followed by a lucrative World Cup with Ivory Coast and the squad he has inherited at Leicester is a strong one, and last season made the play-offs under the sound stewardship of Nigel Pearson. While Sousa was sacked after his side conceded 10 goals in two games, Eriksson has brought solidity to the team. Three high-quality loan signings in the back four \u2013 Kyle Naughton from Tottenham, Greg Cunningham from Manchester City and Curtis Davies from Aston Villa \u2013 certainly help, and Yuki Abe here provided a roving roadblock in defensive midfield. For the most part, it was a wall that Nigel Clough's Derby struggled to break down after King's early opener, the young midfieldercalmly slotting home after Howard had robbed Shaun Barker. But the psychological scars of that miserable start to the season seem yet to have fully healed. Nerves jangled furiously in a second half in which the visitors should have equalised before the Foxes pulled away. Paul Green was the chief culprit, heading wide from close range on the hour. Howard's penalty, after Kris Commons had tripped Naughton, sealed victory. While this was Eriksson's first taste of a derby in this neck of the woods, his opposite number is part of the first family of East Midlands football. Disappointingly, Clough Sr never crossed swords with Eriksson while the pair were leading Nottingham Forest and Gothenburg on European adventures in the early 1980s, and Clough Jr's side, thus far the Championship's surprise package, were well beaten in the end, despite their chances either side of half-time. A louder chorus of the home manager's name came from behind the goal as the seconds ticked down, the fans warming to the theme. \"If we go on as we have today, the future looks very good,\" said Eriksson. Hard to argue with that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
