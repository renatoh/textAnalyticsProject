Within minutes, the 23-year-old, a teenage prodigy turned cricketer and turned back into a tennis player again, was busy trying to share the glory with those she feels have helped her along the way. From her family \u2013 her parents and her two sisters \u2013 to her team, and coach Craig Tyzzer, Barty almost always speaks of \u201cwe\u201d when it comes to describing her exploits. She may be a grand slam champion for the first time, but as far as she is concerned, it has been a team effort. \u201cI\u2019m extremely lucky to have a team around me that love me for Ash Barty the person, not the tennis player,\u201d she said, sitting with the Coupe de Suzanne Lenglen within reach, just an hour or so after her 6-1, 6-3 triumph over the Czech teenager Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1. \u201cI\u2019m extremely lucky to have an amazing family, a truly amazing family that no matter, win lose or draw, the text messages and the facetiming is the same. It\u2019s just a really good group of people around me that make the tennis very easy.\u201d If it wasn\u2019t already clear, Barty is a hugely popular player, as evidenced by the outpouring of congratulations on social media, and directly to Barty via texts and instant messages. From Petra Kvitov\u00e1 to Nick Kyrgios and from numerous players and coaches on both the ATP and WTA Tours, Barty\u2019s achievement was hailed by her peers. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly kind, especially from your peers, I suppose,\u201d said Barty, who shared a handshake and hug with Rod Laver after the match. \u201cAnd people that you see every single week and most weeks of the year, it\u2019s very kind of them to compliment [me], my game. But I think it\u2019s also a compliment to my team. It\u2019s just been an incredible journey, the way we have tried to work and develop and grow this game that I have and this game style and kind of Ash Barty brand of tennis, I suppose. It\u2019s amazing. I haven\u2019t seen any of it yet. It\u2019s just been nice to take a minute or two with my team and celebrate what we have achieved.\u201d There have been some tough days for first-time finalists here at Roland Garros over the years, from Natasha Zvereva being double-bagelled by Steffi Graf in 1988 to Elena Dementieva\u2019s 6-2, 6-2 defeat by Anastasia Myskina in 2004. Barty and Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 were both appearing in their first grand slam final but while the Czech failed to produce her best, Barty was close to perfect in her execution of her game. And hers is a game to bring a smile to the face of anyone who loves to see variety on the court. Compete, enjoy and try to do the best you can \u2013 that\u2019s her mantra \u2013 and the way she plays, with slice, power, angles, drop shots, volleys, kick serves, everything you can imagine, is a joy to watch. As Kirsten Flipkens, the Belgian player, tweeted on Saturday evening: \u201cJust love to watch her play (with a gamestyle similar to mine, just 20 times better. Slice for life! Impressive, Kiddo\u201d. Three years after she returned from an almost two-year hiatus from the Tour, Barty has a grand slam title to her name, a surprise only in the fact that the first one should come at Roland Garros, rather than, say, Wimbledon, where her style of play would seem to be perfectly suited. It was at Wimbledon where she won as a junior, aged 15, but her ability to hit every shot, as encouraged by her first coach, Jim Joyce, means she is a threat on every surface. Barty will rise to world No 2 on Monday, only a handful of points behind Naomi Osaka, and she admitted that reaching top spot was a goal. Her win will inspire a generation of Australian girls to play tennis and as an Indigenous Australian, just like the 1971 champion, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, Barty\u2019s influence is even greater. \u201cI think the pathways and progress we\u2019ve made for Indigenous youth in Australia has been incredible,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there have been more opportunities, there\u2019s more publicity, people are actually aware that there is a pathway for Indigenous youth, not only in tennis but in all sports. But tennis is now becoming a nationwide sport for Indigenous youth. It\u2019s incredible to know what Evonne has done and how passionate she is about it. If I can have any small part in that, that would be incredible.\u201d Barty will celebrate with her family when she heads to the UK for the grass-court season, building to Wimbledon, where she will be a big threat for the title. It\u2019s entirely possible she will be the world No 1 before the summer is out, but whatever success she has, she will ensure her family and team share the credit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
