But new research suggests the management of breast injuries for athletes in these contact sports needs to catch up, particularly as more women and girls enter the game. When PhD candidate Brooke Brisbine took to the road, visiting over 30 training sessions across Victoria, NSW, the ACT and Queensland, she surprised a lot of the female athletes and staff. \u201cIt was quite nearly the first time that any of these players had ever been asked about a breast injury,\u201d Brisbine says. \u201cAnd certainly the first time a vast majority of them had ever said anything about it at all.\u201d In person and online, working with the University of Wollongong and Australian Institute of Sport, Brisbine surveyed almost 300 athletes and close to 250 coaching and medical staff to investigate the occurrence and perception of breast injuries in women\u2019s AFL, rugby sevens, league and union. Fifty-eight percent of players reported experiencing a contact breast injury during training or a game, and almost half of those, more often sub-elite players, said the injury had affected their performance. However, coaches and medical staff were often unaware of the problem and underestimated the occurrence of breast injuries for their players. In the study, most staff estimated fewer than 5% of players had sustained such an injury. Brisbine says this is not surprising considering so few players are reporting their breast injuries. \u201cNo one\u2019s been asking them about it. No one told them that it\u2019s important to report it,\u201d she says, adding that women playing at the community level represented the bulk of her data. According to Brisbine, a lot of female athletes felt they would not be taken seriously if they reported the injury or were unsure if it could be treated. \u201cBreasts are still a bit of a taboo topic, especially in female sports,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a tendency in elite sport to play through the pain.\u201d \u201cWomen are taking the game as seriously as men,\u201d says Deirdre McGhee, research supervisor and co-director of UOW\u2019s Breast Research Australia. \u201cThey\u2019re athletic, but [their bodies] are not exactly the same so we need to pay attention to the differences.\u201d With more and more women and girls participating every year, the research comes at a critical time. Identifying the problem is the first step towards developing strategies to prevent and treat breast injuries to enable women to perform at their best. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying that this is happening to a lot of women. But we\u2019ve identified a problem that has very poor awareness. Girls are not reporting [their injuries], and therefore we are managing it very poorly,\u201d Dr McGhee says. Already players learn to protect themselves from injury with correct technique but with more research to understand the incidence of breast injuries in each code and how they occur, effective preventative strategies can be developed for each game. Retired rugby league player Joanne Barrett understands the differences in physical contact between the rugby codes, having also played a bit of rugby union in her time. \u201cI\u2019ve been a forward and a back in both codes and it is really different types of contact,\u201d she explains. \u201cIn league, there\u2019s a lot more run up, there\u2019s a lot more one-on-ones, as opposed to union.\u201d Barrett played in eight State of Origins for Queensland , the team she now manages, and represented Australia in two World Cups. While she never recalls a breast injury in her playing career, Barrett says we can always do more to improve awareness and proactive strategies to prevent injuries, and thinks the research follows the natural progression of the women\u2019s game. \u201cI\u2019ve often thought until we have some stats and experience and some history in the game, it\u2019s hard to [manage injuries],\u201d Barrett says. \u201cYou need the facts before you can progress.\u201d Club rugby union player and University of Newcastle researcher Sarah Kennedy, who was not involved in the study, says the research findings have already started a good conversation: \u201cEspecially [in female codes] where there are a lot of male coaches and support staff involved [who] may not know how to begin the conversation around reporting of and avoiding these types of injuries.\u201d Kennedy has played club rugby for over a decade and expects the number of reported breast injuries would increase should female players be educated about what constitutes a breast injury, which may be dismissed as bruising. Bruising is certainly a symptom of soft tissue injuries, along with swelling and pain, but as sports physician Sharon Stay explains, after a traumatic breast injury, the fatty fibrous tissue may change. \u201cWe call it fat necrosis. This can be painful, and can distort the shape of the breast,\u201d says Dr Stay who works with Queensland Rugby Union, Netball and Cricket. Head coach of the Brisbane Lions AFLW team Craig Starcevich says he also has not encountered any breast injuries amongst his players, but agrees that technique has a major part to play in injury prevention, particularly at a junior level and for any new player to the sport. \u201cHow we teach players to tackle and mark the ball, those things are probably relevant\u2026 [and] encouraging the athletes to be open and honest with their reporting,\u201d he says. Kennedy, whose own research aims to equip adolescents with the necessary skills to be physically active throughout life, believes education needs to begin at the club level. \u201cIt needs to start from grassroots so that players are coming through with the correct training to avoid injuries in the first place, but also to ensure that those reporting protocols are in place across the board.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
