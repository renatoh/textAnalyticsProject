Trump\u2019s exceptionally turbulent week prompted even some Republicans to utter the word \u201cimpeachment\u201d. But Democrats \u2013 and progressives \u2013 are being warned to be careful what they wish for. If Mike Pence took over, could he actually do more damage to progressive causes than Trump, whose frequent clashes with his own party limit his effectiveness? \u201cWe must focus on what is best for the American people, not on what is worst for our so-called president,\u201d writes Jeff Alson at In These Times. Leading a rallying cry for impeachment could be a strategic blunder for Democrats with long-term consequences. \u201cDemocratic ownership of impeachment would also cement the loyalty of working-class Trump voters to the Republican party,\u201d writes Alson. World to Trump: \u2018Go back to your country!\u2019 Trump\u2019s first overseas trip \u2013 to Saudi Arabia, Israel, Belgium, Italy and the Vatican \u2013 is expected to be besieged by protesters. Tens of thousands of people are expected to attend a \u201cTrump not welcome\u201d protest in Brussels on Wednesday 24 May. Protesters say they are \u201cunited in saying \u2018No!\u2019 to Trump\u201d, who they say has spent his past months \u201cdividing and excluding people, denying climate change, intimidating the media [and] phasing out solidarity\u201d. Trump is visiting the Belgian capital for the Nato summit; a day earlier he\u2019ll be in Vatican City to meet the pope. Rome-based activists are planning a protest there too. PS One of the ring leaders works in your bank! What is it with New Jersey\u2019s Republican congressmen? Last week Tom MacArthur was the focus of the Garden State\u2019s ire after the alleged moderate managed to get the Republican healthcare bill passed. This week the 22-year incumbent Rodney Frelinghuysen, of New Jersey\u2019s 11th district, has been criticized for a dastardly scheme of his own \u2013 \u201couting\u201d a progressive (and anti-Frelinghuysen) activist to her employer. Frelinghuysen, whose district was only narrowly won by Trump in 2016, sent a boilerplate fundraising letter to a board member of Lakeland Bank in March. Attached was a news report on the activist group NJ 11th for Change, which has been pestering Frelinghuysen to hold a town hall. Frelinghuysen, who hasn\u2019t held an in-person town hall for four years, wrote at the bottom of the article: \u201cPS One of the ring leaders works in your bank!\u201d Saily Avelenda, the \u201cring leader\u201d in question, told the Guardian she was subsequently confronted with the letter by her boss. She resigned four weeks later. A couple of positives for the group: an ethics complaint has been filed against Frelignhuysen, and NJ 11th for Change \u2013 a group which \u201cwas barely making any news\u201d, according to Avelenda \u2013 has had its name spread far and wide. Onward together! (With Hillary Clinton) On Tuesday, Hillary Clinton sprung back into the public consciousness to launch \u2026 a progressive activist organisation! Onward together \u2013 not the most inspiring of rallying cries \u2013 \u201cwill encourage people to get involved, organize and even run for office\u201d, Clinton said. According to the organization\u2019s website: \u201cOnward Together will advance progressive values and work to build a brighter future for generations to come.\u201d There isn\u2019t a huge amount of information about Onward Together yet \u2013 but part of the focus will be donating funds to other groups. Color of Change, Indivisible and Swing Left have already received donations in the \u201clow six figures\u201d, according to Elle. What we\u2019re reading The label \u201calt-left\u201d, increasingly applied to progressives by Republicans and commentators, is both a slur and inaccurate, writes Bhaskar Sunkara. The Democratic party isn\u2019t \u201cleft\u201d itself, Sunkara says, so \u201cwho are we the \u2018alt\u2019 to?\u201d In any case, the attention being paid to progressives by mainstream politicians shows that it looks \u201cincreasingly like modernity\u2019s (and democracy\u2019s) only hope\u201d. Health tip of the week People marching, rallying and generally spending energy resisting the government\u2019s agenda should be careful. According to Donald Trump, exercise drains the human body\u2019s \u201cfinite energy resources\u201d. \u201cOther than golf, he considers exercise misguided, arguing that a person, like a battery, is born with a finite amount of energy,\u201d the New Yorker wrote.
