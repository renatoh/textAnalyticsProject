However, the former Aston Villa goalkeeper will forever be remembered for another kind of delivery: the second goal in the second-city derby of December 2002, a throw-in which rolled right under his foot. Villa went on to lose that match 3-0. That clanger was awful for Enckelman but hilarious for everyone else, and has become the defining moment in the recent history of the derby. This might seem odd given the significance of the fixture, but it is not entirely out of keeping with its spirit. This is a match with confused alliances, unlikely heroes and vegetable\u2011based banter. And it resumes on Sunday lunchtime in the first league encounter between the sides for five years. Steve Bruce remembers the Enckelman game well because it was the now Aston Villa manager\u2019s first derby in charge of Birmingham City. Bruce has spent much of this week discussing his history on the other side of the city, a history that includes periods as both player and manager at St Andrew\u2019s, and which lasted a decade in all. It was Bruce who took City to the Premier League for the first time and, in so doing, rekindled a rivalry that had lain dormant for too long. \u201cThere hadn\u2019t been a derby game for 17 years: it was a fabulous occasion and the result went their way,\u201d Bruce said of the Enckelman match, indulging in the convolutions his position makes necessary. \u201cEnckelman makes a mistake but who can forget it. It was that little bit of luck. What we talk about in these games is mistakes, a bounce of the ball, a touch of genius, a bit of indiscipline. That\u2019s what makes the difference. It\u2019s what playing in the derby is all about.\u201d Bruce describes his 2002 side as a \u201cbunch of pirates\u201d for whom a black away shirt was an appropriate uniform. They were a side who knew how to get a rise on their more illustrious rivals. It was the defender Olof Mellberg\u2019s throw in that went under Enckelman. \u201cI have definitely never been involved in a game such as the first match at Birmingham,\u201d the Swede said, two years later. \u201cI don\u2019t particularly like Birmingham City after the four games we have played against them in the Premiership.\u201d Bruce duly used those lines as his pre\u2011match team talk and Birmingham defeated Villa again 2-1. Nowadays Bruce is known by Blues fans as Mr Potatohead (he has encouraged them to come up with something more original this weekend). Inevitably Robbie Savage, who was part of Bruce\u2019s Birmingham midfield and lost only once against Villa in his career, has also been stirring it up this week, trying to rekindle the spirit of the noughties. \u201cMan for man Villa [were] better,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, \u201cbut we had a team spirit, desire and belief that made us play above ourselves in those games!\u201d The Birmingham manager, Gary Rowett, will be looking at the fixture this week and hoping he can conjure up a similar response. The urbane Rowett (he is a wine connoisseur and confesses to drinking a glass of fine rioja before a match) has also had issues of affiliation to resolve. Since taking the reins at St Andrew\u2019s in 2014 he has faced questions over whether he was a childhood Villa fan. This week he put the speculation to bed with an impressively lawyerly answer. \u201cAs a kid I had plenty of teams that I liked and they were one of the teams,\u201d he said. \u201cI openly admitted when I came here that I followed some of their results but hadn\u2019t actually gone to Villa Park as a kid. \u201cHaving played at St Andrew\u2019s for two years and been here as a manager for two years, I would like to think people will understand that I am thoroughly Blue \u2013 and a Birmingham City fan.\u201d Rowett\u2019s Birmingham are a physical side who can also play and they sit one place outside the Championship play-offs. But they come into the derby in dwindling form having won only two of their past six matches. They were roundly outplayed in their last fixture, a 2-0 defeat at Burton Albion. Villa, meanwhile, are unbeaten under Bruce and looking to extend back\u2011to\u2011back victories, the last of which \u2013 a 1-0 win against Fulham \u2013 was achieved with a late Bruce tactical switch. The derby is, lest we forget, just another three points, but Bruce believes the result could be important for the rest of the season. \u201cIt will certainly help if you can get the result,\u201d he said this week. \u201cTwo weeks ago we were in the bottom three. If we do manage to turn them over we\u2019d be three points behind them and sitting outside the play-offs. That\u2019s got to be the long-term game and if we do make it three wins out of four it would be a smashing achievement for what we\u2019re trying to achieve.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
