Several other British publishers were trying to do the same. There was a widespread belief that in the attics and bottom drawers of Moscow and Rostov, precious manuscripts, masterpieces in the tradition of Bulgakov or Solzhenitsyn, lay waiting for the end of censorship. For several weeks, working with translators, we sifted the stories that were emerging to the west, some from authors \u2013 Viktoria Tokareva, Lyudmilla Petrushevskaya \u2013 who had already been signed by agents in New York and London. Most of these stories, inevitably, were a disappointment. They were heavy with opaque metaphor or clunky satire, or written with a kind of dreamlike density or self-absorption that was hard to fathom. However, from among that pile of manuscripts, I recall the excitement of reading for the first time one that had a sharply different tone from the others. The manuscript was not fiction at all, but a series of first-person narratives from bereaved relatives and survivors of the long war in Afghanistan that had brought Soviet power to its knees. In contrast to the more baroque takes on totalitarianism these stories built to something that was startling in its clarity of voice, and powerfully moving in its observed detail. The stories were collected under the title Zinky Boys \u2013 the bleak name that widows and mothers had given to husbands and sons returning from the war in zinc-lined coffins. The stories had been collected and written by a woman from Minsk in Belarus called Svetlana Alexievich. I didn\u2019t know anything about her \u2013 and in those pre-internet days could not fill any blanks \u2013 but over a week or two editing and revising the translations for publication, I got to know quite intimately the cadence of her testimonies, which were a masterclass in shaping raw experience to fit a couple of pages. As anyone who has ever tried to transcribe interviews knows, there is a sort of omnipotence to the process, cutting and arranging while staying faithful to the quoted words. The recollections of survivors or those living with grief are different to other voices in this regard. The traumatic experiences they describe have long been in the retelling as the brain tries to hold them in the frame of normal human experience. Their contours have been smoothed and polished over lifetimes, like stones turned over in old pockets. The trick, then, is to listen for the telling detail, knowing where to begin and what to leave out. Alexievich\u2019s ear seemed uncannily pitch-perfect in this regard. She knew what resonated. Over the years since, as her other books have emerged in the west, she has provided a micro-commentary on the great bloody forces of war and revolution and repression that shaped the world she was born into; the view from the ground. Her oral history, Chernobyl Prayer, gathering testament from survivors of that cataclysm was the primary resource for the acclaimed recent TV drama Chernobyl; writer Craig Mazin said: \u201cI drew historical fact and scientific information from many sources, but Ms Alexievich\u2019s book was where I always turned to find beauty and sorrow.\u201d In 2015 Alexievich became one of the most inspired and inspiring of all Nobel prize winners, a genuine bearer of witness. As is often the case with translated Nobel laureates, her books have appeared in somewhat random order. This latest \u2013 which brings all of her books into print in English \u2013 documents the memories of children who survived the sieges and deprivations of the long struggle against Nazi invasion on the eastern front of the second world war, and was first published in 1985. It was a companion volume to Alexievich\u2019s The Unwomanly Face of War, which told the story of that terrible conflict in the voices of women. The books were both bestsellers in the Soviet Union, in the first years of glasnost. They were also a passport for Alexievich to tell the more subversive stories of the Russian present, of Afghanistan and Chernobyl, that followed. Last Witnesses, like all of her books, works by accretion. There are more than a hundred accounts of childhood, each told with a familiar, blunt poignancy. Recollections of unimaginable terror \u2013 of the bombing and desolation that left 15 million civilians dead \u2013 are told in a kind of relentless clamour, each voice given its due. There are stories of Volodia Korshuk, son of a partisan, later a professor of history, who at seven witnessed his mother murdered by the Nazis; or of Varya Vyrko, later a weaver, who recalls how they were forced to bury their grandfather in the garden; or Volodia Ampilogov, later a locksmith, who was rounded up for a concentration camp, but escaped the train when it was bombed; or Maria Puzan, who witnessed her parents burned in barn, and who recalls being given a lovely orange frock with pockets at the orphanage she was sent to and saying: \u201cIf I die, please bury me in this dress.\u201d And always, through repetition, the themes of displacement and long roads and rubble and chaos of \u201cthe inexplicable war\u201d. It is tempting to compare Alexievich\u2019s work to that of the great oral historians, such as Studs Terkel \u2013 a closer cousin is John Hersey\u2019s indelible account of the survivors of Hiroshima \u2013 but there is a special sort of clear-eyed humility to her reporting. She apparently gets entirely out of the way of her subjects and lets them do all the telling. She resists any editorial comment. Her only preface here is a pointed quote from Dostoevsky asking if ideology, revolution, war, ever justifies the tears of even one child. Alexievich\u2019s life\u2019s work, as an attentive listener to all the collected sorrows and stubborn survival of her homeland, quietly, unflinchingly and unforgettably serves to answer that question in the negative. \u2022 Last Witnesses: Unchildlike Stories by Svetlana Alexievich (translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky) is published by Penguin Classics (\u00a312.99).
