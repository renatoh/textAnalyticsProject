They will co-develop and market HuMax-CD20, an experimental antibody treatment for CD20 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is also undergoing phase 2 clinical two trials for rheumatoid arthritis which, if successful, could raise the value of the deal. Genmab will receive a licence fee of \u00a352m and milestone payments of up to \u00a3800m. GSK will buy 4.5m Genmab shares for \u00a3183m. Julia Kollewe Vodafone sells back stake in Swiss mobile company Vodafone has sold its 25% stake in Swisscom Mobile back to Swisscom for Sfr4.25bn (\u00a31.78bn). The deal had been widely expected but the price is above expectations and is roughly the same as Vodafone paid five years ago. Swisscom, majority-owned by the Swiss government, already owns the remaining 75% of Swisscom Mobile. Vodafone's chief executive, Arun Sarin, said: \"Vodafone and Swisscom have enjoyed an excellent relationship since we acquired our 25% stake. We do not, however, see ourselves as the most appropriate holder of this minority stake in the longer term.\" Fiona Walsh US rate fears as rise in prices hits 32-year high The sharpest rise in US factory gate prices for 32 years and a bounce-back in housing starts have severely dented hopes of an early cut in US interest rates. Data released in Washington yesterday showed producer prices rose by 2% in November and by 1.3% on the \"core measure\", which excludes food and energy costs. A rise in oil prices has been one factor pushing up the US production costs but analysts said the rise in \"core inflation\" would worry the US Federal Reserve. Producer prices are an early warning of inflationary pressure, indicating cost pressure at the start of the supply chain. Larry Elliott January deadline set in \u00a34.9bn battle for Corus The Takeover Panel has set a January 30 deadline on the \u00a34.9bn bid battle for the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus. Last week Corus accepted a 515p-a-share bid from the Brazilian group CSN, which launched its offer just hours after its Indian rival Tata Steel had raised its own bid from \u00a34.3bn to \u00a34.7bn. Tata, which kicked the battle off on October 5, is considering its position. The panel said yesterday that following talks with both bidders, it had set a final date of January 30 for Tata and CSN to put in a revised offer. Shares in Corus are still ahead of the CSN terms, closing at 531.5p, up 3.5p yesterday. Fiona Walsh House prices defy rate rises but pace set to slow House prices rose for the 13th consecutive month in November, though the pace has stabilised, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said in a report yesterday. A spokesman, Jeremy Leaf, said: \"The Bank of England's rate rises have failed to dent the housing market's armour.\" RICS predicts prices will rise by 7% in 2007 following a jump of about 9% this year. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight, said the data was still very strong overall, \"but there are tentative hints that activity may have peaked and house prices will gradually lose momentum\".
