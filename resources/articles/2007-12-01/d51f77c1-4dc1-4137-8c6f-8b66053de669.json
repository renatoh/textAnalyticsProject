His name is Manchung. Fellow OzBuser Natasha's glossy black stallion gallops into the distance, but Manchung remains slowly clop clop clopping along, led on a rope by his minder, Sandy. Forgive me my lack of daring, for I have steered clear of all things equine since an unfortunate donkey ride along Blackpool sands aged eight. Manchung and I are heading for the live volcano, Mount Bromo in East Java, Indonesia, which churns smoke into green valleys. There, I brave my own two feet for the hundreds of steps up to the summit, where eerie plumes of sulphurous smoke rise menacingly from the crater. Legend has it that a 15th-century princess sacrificed her child here and that its voice can still be heard, though the only sound I can hear is my own gasping for breath. Since I left you last week, we have crossed so much space in so little time. My last dispatch ended on a cliff - or road - hanger in Bukittinggi after the road ahead had been washed away. The group plotted various escape routes until we were offered a flight to Yogyakarta, via Jakarta, saving 50 hours of road travel. From Yogyakarta, we visited the great stone Borobudur temple with its headless Buddhas, stopping en route to be taunted by the hidden gem of a hotel, the Amanjiwo, beloved of millionaires and honeymooners. Onwards to that spectacular, terrifying drive up to Bromo, scene of the horse-riding, or horse-plodding in my case. We stayed at Bromo's Lava View Lodge guesthouse with its snug little bungalows and hawkers flogging woolly hats. But all too soon it was time to leave and rejoin the bus at the crack of dawn, destination: Bali. \"You wanna come to my room?\" purred the pretty woman in tight dress and red devil ears in the beach resort Kuta. \"I promise sexy lady dancing in my room. You wanna come ...\" she began again with the automatic repetition of a mechanical doll. The many who walked on by didn't, evidently, wanna go to My Room, which turned out, when I investigated the next day, to be a spacious, stylish new bar on a seedy street in Kuta Beach teeming with men offering marijuana and cheap motorbike rides. Many of the group did fancy going to the nearby Bounty's nightclub, Paddy's Bar and the Kama Sutra club, in order to peek at the people painted in compromising positions on the ceiling. And I wanted to go to the Hard Rock Cafe Hotel, if only to flirt with the idea of plunging into the largest swimming pool in Asia. Soon enough, we awoke to our last sunrise in the Far East. The bags were padlocked, the visas printed out. The muddy shoes scrubbed to a gleam to avoid quarantine in Darwin airport. Prime Minister Howard has just been booted from power. The plane zoomed into the night, a great cheer rose - never have meat pies brought so much glee, and we finally touched down at 2.40am, in our final continent, yet to be conquered. \u00b7 oz-bus.com."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
