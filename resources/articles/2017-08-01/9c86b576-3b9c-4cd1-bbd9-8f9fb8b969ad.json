After failing to cut into them, the veteran Great British Bake Off judge rises from his seat, stacks my desserts on the floor and steps on them to prove that even a boot would fall short of dismantling them. It seems a tad harsh, even for a man known for his steely looks and severe put-downs on screen. But Hollywood is not one for pulling punches when it comes to his culinary criticism, and he has strong words for those who questioned his decision to remain with GBBO after Channel 4 controversially poached the programme from the BBC last year. \u201cI question those who have criticised me for staying with Bake Off,\u201d Hollywood says from the set in Welford Park in Berkshire on a rainy afternoon in mid-July. \u201cI\u2019ve just stuck with my job, because I love it. Why would I leave my job? It\u2019s everyone else who has left.\u201d Channel 4 will air the highly anticipated first episode of the The Great British Bake Off on 29 August. With 14 million viewers watching its most recent final, the show\u2019s relocation prompted a backlash from fans and members of the cast. Presenters Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc cut ties with the show, as did Hollywood\u2019s co-judge and national treasure, Mary Berry, who is returning to her role as a judge on a new BBC cooking programme. In their place, Channel 4 has brought on Prue Leith as a judge and Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig as presenters. The programme is still based at Welford Park, the country house and private estate, famous for its display of snowdrops, and once used by King Henry VIII as his personal hunting lodge. Welford Park has been the site of the Bake Off tent for the past four years. But for the first time, producers have opened the doors to newspaper journalists, who have the opportunity to have their baking critiqued by Hollywood and Leith. The cabbie who drove me to the site from Newbury told me he was strictly forbidden from talking about the show, and that all the taxi drivers who took people to the location had to sign a contract. \u201cI find it quite amusing,\u201d he said, joking that I would probably have to produce my fingerprints on arrival. While I didn\u2019t have to do that, I was required to sign a non-disclosure agreement and refrain from taking any pictures or tweeting about the day. The machinations of Bake Off, it appears, are as classified as those of Area 51, and one producer quipped that whenever she brings family and friends to the set, it feels \u201ca bit like they\u2019ve won the golden ticket to see Willy Wonka\u201d. With this air of mystery, can viewers expect a different show to the one they have grown accustomed to? \u201cWe\u2019ve got different hosts and a different judge, that\u2019s the only difference,\u201d Hollywood says. \u201cThe feel of the show is exactly the same as it\u2019s always been. \u201cOnce people watch it they\u2019ll understand that the format is what it\u2019s all about. The main picture has always been the bakers, and the standard has been borderline professional this year.\u201d \u201cI really think if you give it one minute\u2019s thought,\u201d Leith says, \u201cChannel 4 paid a lot of money for a product: they\u2019re not then going to change that product, they\u2019re buying what was hugely successful.\u201d Last month, Channel 4 boss, Jay Hunt, suggested the new series would be given a \u201cmodern\u201d revamp, and Fielding and Toksvig are expected to help deliver this. \u201cI think if you put Noel Fielding into a show, he\u2019s going to make it a bit cool,\u201d Leith says. \u201cModernisation is probably the wrong word,\u201d Hollywood says. \u201cThere\u2019s a change in dynamics with Noel and Sandy, because they\u2019re not Mel and Sue, who have been together for 150 years or something. Noel and Sandy\u2019s comedy is different to theirs. But it\u2019s really funny, and together it\u2019s hilarious because it\u2019s so starkly different.\u201d And do Hollywood and Leith share a chemistry and sense of humour? \u201cIt feels like I\u2019ve been working with Prue for years. She reminds me of my mother-in-law, in a good way,\u201d he says. \u201cWe met at one of the tests, and as soon as we started chatting, in my head I went, \u2018yep, that\u2019s it\u2019.\u201d \u201cWe both laugh at the same things, but Paul is wicked,\u201d Prue says. \u201cI mean, he is absolutely wicked. When I was really nervous on the very first day, I walked into the tent, and we had to learn the names of 12 people we\u2019d never clapped eyes on. I couldn\u2019t remember one contestant\u2019s name. I asked Paul, \u2018that\u2019s Harry, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 He said, \u2018no, that\u2019s Tom.\u2019 So I said, \u2018Tom, tell us about your signature bake,\u2019 and everyone laughed. Cut. He was lying and landed me bang in it. I thought, \u2018okay, I\u2019ve got your measure.\u2019\u201d Though she was brought on to replace Berry, Leith, cool and collected, explains she feels no pressure about having to step into her predecessor\u2019s shoes. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be Mary. She stood there, tasted the cakes, said what she thought about it \u2013 I do exactly the same. It\u2019s just that I have a different personality \u2026 Presumably they hired me because they think I can do the job. I\u2019m doing the job, I\u2019m enjoying it \u2013 I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s going wrong.\u201d While praising the \u201cstrongest characters\u201d in the show\u2019s history, the judges refuse to pick a favourite, claiming the only thing that will impress them is what\u2019s on the plate. \u201cWe won\u2019t remember your face but we\u2019ll remember your brownies,\u201d Leith says in a further vote of confidence. Past contestants, she says, \u201call hugely admire Paul, and I\u2019ve noticed that some of them will still text him if they need help or advice.\u201d \u201cWhat? The bakers here, text me? When?\u201d Hollywood asks in horror, before saying: \u201cNadiya [Hussain] texted me and said, \u2018are you going to a demo this weekend?\u2019 Candice [Brown] texted because I got a copy of her new book, which I thought was amazing. Nancy [Birtwhistle] came on my tour, she\u2019d just won by about two months, so she texts me occasionally. Prue is making out like the bakers here text me: it\u2019s certainly not every day.\u201d So no WhatsApp thread? \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t message them going, \u2018hi guys, how are you getting on today, you winners?\u2019\u201d Leith comes to the rescue. \u201cWhat I meant is Paul has this exterior of being tough as old boots, but ask him for some help and he\u2019ll give it to you,\u201d she says. \u201cI am sure there are past bakers who feel that their career has been helped by him.\u201d Unfortunately, it seems there won\u2019t be any help for my baking career. Even though I make my excuses \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve only baked twice before\u201d and \u201cit was short notice\u201d \u2013 Hollywood is having none of it. The only sage words of advice are that they could always use me on set as a handyman and my brownies as bricks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
