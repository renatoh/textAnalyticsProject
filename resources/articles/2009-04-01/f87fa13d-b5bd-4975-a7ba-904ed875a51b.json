Ronaldo's manager felt the Ballon D'Or winner did not put himself out enough for his team-mates in the first leg at Old Trafford that ended in a 2-2 draw. That was one of the reasons Ronaldo was asked to play a more central role at the Estadio do Dragao, leaving Wayne Rooney and Ryan Giggs to do the hard yards down the flanks in the 1-0 win by United. Ronaldo acknowledges the importance of his boss's opinion. \"It is not a problem,\" he said. \"I always respect the manager and coaches because I want to learn. \"If he says that it is because he thinks it is true. But I think I have been playing well and I have scored a few important goals.\" The close bond between Ferguson and Ronaldo is one of the reasons United feel so bullish about the player staying at Old Trafford. Manchester United have reacted with their usual disdain to comments from former Real Madrid president Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n that Ronaldo will leave for the Bernab\u00e9u this summer, It seemed there was no chance of the 24-year-old remaining at Old Trafford last summer, only for him to renew his pledge to the club following a face-to-face meeting with Ferguson, who flew out to meet the player immediately before United's summer tour. Ferguson declared 'he would not sell them a virus' when it emerged just before Christmas that the Real hierarchy felt Ronaldo's transfer was in the bag. The removal of Calder\u00f3n has seen a reduction in the number of Ronaldo reports coming out of Madrid but the ex-president told RMC: \"Anyone who becomes the next president will have at his disposal one of the best players in the world, who is already formally committed to Real Madrid. \"I cannot give any names, but all I can say is that thanks to the difficult and laborious work that I did last year, he is already formally a Madrid player, subject obviously to him being able to sign the relevant contract.\" United last week revealed debts in excess of \u00a3650m and some will claim the club's owners have a vested interest in selling if the price reaches \u00a375m. The reaction from United insiders to Calder\u00f3n's comments was akin to 'we have heard it all before'. Ronaldo's goal was enough to earn United a Champions League semi-final with Arsenal. Before that United must tackle Everton in the last four of the FA Cup before playing Portsmouth and Tottenham as part of a Premier League title race they are still leading after winning their last two games. \"We have an opportunity to win everything and we are very confident that we can,\" said the Portuguese international. \"We did not play fantastic in the last five or six games but we expect the next ones will be better because of what we did last night.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
