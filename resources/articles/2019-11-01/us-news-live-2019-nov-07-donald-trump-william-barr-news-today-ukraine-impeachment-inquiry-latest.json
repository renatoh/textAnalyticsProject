An aide to Mike Pence testified in the impeachment inquiry. Jennifer Williams, who attended a closed-door deposition as planned, was among the officials listening to the July 25 call between Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky. Former New York governor and billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg is reportedly preparing to join the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries. Progressive frontrunners Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders responded to the news with some light trolling. Former attorney general Jeff Sessions has entered the US senate race, vying to retake his former seat as Alabama senator. Trump was fined $2m for misusing charity funds to boost his presidential campaign. The Washington Post has obtained an advance copy of the book by an anonymous writer who describes themselves as a senior official in the Trump administration. Here are some key excerpts: \u201cIt\u2019s like showing up at the nursing home at daybreak to find your elderly uncle running pantsless across the courtyard and cursing loudly about the cafeteria food, as worried attendants tried to catch him\u201d the author wrote. Trump allegedly attempted a Hispanic accent to mock migrants attempting to cross the US-Mexico border: \u201cWe get these women coming in with like seven children,\u201d Trump said, according to Anonymous. \u201cThey are saying, \u2018Oh, please help! My husband left me!\u2019 They are useless. They don\u2019t do anything for our country. At least if they came in with a husband we could put him in the fields to pick corn or something.\u201d Trump apparently wanted to get reduce the number of federal judges: \u201cCan we just get rid of the judges? Let\u2019s get rid of the [expletive] judges,\u201d he reportedly said. As anticipated, the former attorney general has announced that he\u2019s running to retake his former role as a senator from Alabama. Sessions, who earned Donald Trump\u2019s ire for recusing himself from Russia probe, remains a frequent punching bag for the president. In a statement posted on his campaign website, Sessions appears to anticipate blowback from the president with fawning praise for Potus. \u201cHave I said a cross word about President Trump? No.\u201d Sessions said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you why: first, that would be dishonorable. I was there to serve his agenda, not mine. Second, the President is doing a great job for America and Alabama, and he has my strong support,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs everyone knows, President Trump and I have had our ups and downs. But here\u2019s the important part: the President is doing great work for America.\u201d Trump has said that naming Sessions as the attorney general was the \u201cbiggest mistake\u201d of his presidency. John Kasich said he won\u2019t challenge Trump in the 2020 presidential race In a series of tweets, John Kasich said won\u2019t running for president. The Republican former governor of Ohio said, \u201cAt this point, I continue to believe that, for me, there\u2019s no clear path to prevail that I can see.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to push my supporters, my friends, my family to do something that I don\u2019t think will result in success at this point,\u201d he said. Kasich ran against Trump in 2016. When he dropped out of the race then, he refused to endorse Trump and declined to attend the Republican National Convention that year. Some moderate Republicans had wondered whether he\u2019d pursue a rematch. Donald Trump responds to $2m fine: \u2018No wonder why we are all leaving!\u2019 The president, and now ex-New Yorker was ordered by a judge to pay $2m in damages for illegally diverting funds from his charity to his 2016 presidential election campaign. Still, per his statement, Trump will be complying. In a statement, he said he\u2019s \u201chappy to donate $2 million\u201d to \u201cworthy charities\u201d. This is exactly what Justice Saliann Scarpulla ordered the Trump family to do as part of a settlement with the New York state attorney general\u2019s office after \u201cpersistent\u201d violations\u201d of law and \u201crepeated and willful self-dealing\u201d. Bernie on Bloomberg: \u2018The billionaire class is scared\u2019 Like fellow progressive 2020 candidate Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders has responded to news the Michael Bloomberg may be entering the 2020 race with a bring-it-on attitude. Sanders\u2019 campaign manager Faiz Shakir also said, in a statement: \u201cMore billionaires seeking more political power surely isn\u2019t the change America needs.\u201d It\u2019s still unclear whether the former New York mayor and billionaire businessman will enter the 2020 primaries. He\u2019s expected to file paperwork this week to enter the primary in Alabama, which has an early deadline. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Warren has upped her trolling. Her tax calculator for billionaires now features quick links for Bloomberg as well as Bill Gates and Leon Cooperman. The Guardian\u2019s Tom McCarthy (my live-blogging buddy today) has some more in-depth analysis from the testimony of State Department official George Kent. Kent, who was responsible for Ukraine policy, provides new details on the reactions inside the State Department to Rudy Giuliani\u2019s meddling: Trump told Zelenskiy on the phone in late July that he wanted him to pursue investigations of his political rival Joe Biden and a 2016 election conspiracy theory, according to a call summary released by the White House. But by early September, after a creep down what another witness has described as a \u201ccontinuum\u201d of \u201cinsidiousness\u201d, the demand had grown more specific. Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, told fellow diplomats at the time that \u201che, Gordon, had talked to the President \u2013 POTUS in sort of shorthand \u2013 and POTUS wanted nothing less than President Zelenskiy to go to a microphone and say \u2018investigations\u2019, \u2018Biden\u2019, and \u2018Clinton\u2019,\u201d Kent testified, according to the new transcripts. Elizabeth Warren welcomes Michael Bloomberg to the 2020 race, with the utmost sincerity: George Kent, the senior State Department official responsible for Ukraine policy testified that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani \u201chad been carrying on a campaign for several months full of lies and incorrect information,\u201d and his \u201cassertions and allegations against former\u201d Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch \u201cwere without basis, untrue, period\u201d. According to the testimony released today, Kent unsuccessfully pressed the State Department to issue a \u201cclear statement of support for Ambassador Yovanovitch\u201d after a series of \u201cfalsehoods\u201d and \u201ctweets by members of the Presidential family.\u201d Yovanovitch, who was herself deposed in the House democrats impeachment inquiry, said she ambassador Yovanovitch says she was told to tweet praise of the president to save her job. Bloomberg is preparing to enter the Democratic presidential primary, the New York Times reports. He\u2019s expected to file paperwork designating himself as a candidate in Alabama this week. From the Times: Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and billionaire businessman, has been privately weighing a bid for the White House for weeks and has not yet made a final decision on whether to run, an adviser said. But in the first sign that he is seriously moving toward a campaign, Mr. Bloomberg has dispatched staffers to Alabama to gather signatures to qualify for the primary there. Though Alabama does not hold an early primary, it has a Friday deadline for candidates to formally enter the race. The billionaire businessman with centrist politics has \u2014 like some other billionaire businessmen \u2014 expressed skepticism at the policies of progressive front-runners Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: A judge in New York orders Donald Trump to pay $2 million for misusing his charitable foundation. In testimony newly released Thursday, longtime foreign service officer George Kent said Trump wanted the Ukrainian president to say three words \u2013 \u201cinvestigation\u201d, \u201cBiden\u201d and \u201cClinton\u201d \u2013 to hold up Ukraine\u2019s end of a bargain whose terms were unclear to Kent. A senior aide on the campaign of billionaire Tom Steyer in Iowa has been offering money for endorsements, the AP reported. Intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff told Republicans they have until Saturday to suggest impeachment witnesses. Schiff laid out \u201cinquiry parameters\u201d that read to some like draft articles of impeachment. No 1: \u201cDid the President request that a foreign leader and government initiate investigations to benefit the President\u2019s personal political interests in the United States, including an investigation related to the President\u2019s political rival and potential opponent in the 2020 U.S. presidential election?\u201d Former national security adviser John Bolton did not show up for a scheduled deposition before the committees. Trump repeatedly attacked reports that attorney general William Barr refused his request to go on television and say there was nothing illegal about a July call between Trump and Ukraine. Donald Trump has been talking with his TV producer pals about life after the presidency and there might be an Apprentice: White House. Pence aide Jennifer Williams, who testified earlier today, told impeachment investigators that she found a 25 July call between Trump and the Ukrainian president to be \u201cunusual because it was political in nature,\u201d according to a CNN report citing two sources familiar with the testimony. But Williams did not shed light on what Pence might have known about the Ukraine plot, CNN reports: She was asked by lawmakers in her closed-door deposition what Pence knows and she testified that she never heard him mention anything about investigations of the 2016 election, Burisma -- the Ukrainian natural gas company on whose board Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter say -- or the Bidens. Yes, that gentleman who accompanied Pence aide Jennifer Williams to her deposition earlier was in fact exceptionally tall, the internet reveals: Kent\u2019s testimony nails down the broad planks of Trump\u2019s plot in Ukraine familiar from previous testimony: Giuliani and diplomats, especially Sondland and Volker, were chasing Ukraine to announce investigations into Biden, the discovery of which shocked career diplomats as much as did the announcement that \u201cthe acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, at the direction of the President had put a hold on all security assistance to the Ukraine.\u201d Notably, Kent turned on his boss, secretary of state Mike Pompeo, after Pompeo sent what Kent thought was an inaccurate letter accusing Congress of attempting to bully, intimidate, and threaten career foreign service officers. \u201cAnd I was one of two career foreign service officers which had received letters from the committees, and I had not felt bullied, threatened, and intimidated,\u201d Kent said. He notified top state department lawyers and the director of the foreign service that what Pompeo said was wrong. Finally, Kent documented the Trump plot unfolding in Ukraine at the time, with a 16 August memo. \u201cI wrote a note to the file saying that I had concerns that there was an effort to initiate politically motivated prosecutions that were injurious to the rule of law, both Ukraine and the U.S,\u201d Kent said. Here are top lines from the Kent testimony, as selected by the committees: Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was recalled because Rudy Giuliani, Lev Parnas, Igor Fruman, and others \u201cstarted reaching out actively to undermine Ambassador Yovanovitch.\u201d Yuriy Lutsenko made a private trip to New York to meet with Rudy Giuliani in order to \u201cthrow mud\u201d at State Department officials, including Mr. Kent and Ambassador Yovanovitch. Mr. Giuliani was \u201calmost unmissable\u201d as the \u201ccampaign of slander\u201d against Ambassador Yovanovitch and others unfolded in Ukraine and the United States. The State Department reached \u201cthe breaking point of our disillusionment with Yuriy Lutsenko,\u201d the Ukrainian prosecutor general, when they discovered he was \u201cessentially colluding with a corrupt official\u201d to undermine a legitimate investigation into fake passports. Mr. Kent unsuccessfully pressed the State Department to issue a \u201cclear statement of support for Ambassador Yovanovitch\u201d after a series of \u201cfalsehoods\u201d and \u201cTweets by members of the Presidential family.\u201d Ambassador Gordon Sondland suggested that Ambassador Yovanovitch \u201cdo a video or tweet declaring full support for the foreign policy of President Trump.\u201d The United States \u201chad our Ambassador just removed through actions by corrupt Ukrainians in Ukraine as well as private American citizens back here.\u201d Rudy Giuliani \u201chad been carrying on a campaign for several months full of lies and incorrect information,\u201d and his \u201cassertions and allegations against former Ambassador Yovanovitch were without basis, untrue, period.\u201d After Rudy Giuliani attacked Ambassador Taylor, Under Secretary of State David Hale warned him to \u201ckeep my head down and lower my profile in Ukraine.\u201d Ambassador Kurt Volker, Ambassador Sondland, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry asserted that they \u201chad the mandate to take the lead on coordinating efforts to engage the new Ukrainian leadership.\u201d Ambassador Volker had a private discussion with President Zelensky \u201cto underscore the importance of the messaging that Zelensky needed to provide to President Trump about his willingness to be cooperative.\u201d Ambassador Volker said \u201che planned to start reaching out to\u201d Rudy Giuliani because \u201cit was clear that the former mayor had influence on the President in terms of the way the President thought of Ukraine.\u201d Ambassador Volker was \u201cthinking tactically\u201d about interacting with Rudy Giuliani, but Mr. Kent was \u201cconcerned strategically.\u201d There was \u201cgreat confusion\u201d during a call on July 18, 2019, when an OMB official announced that \u201cthe acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, at the direction of the President had put a hold on all security assistance to the Ukraine.\u201d After the call between Presidents Trump and Zelensky on July 25, 2019, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman was \u201cuncomfortable\u201d and said \u201che could not share the majority of what was discussed because of the very sensitive nature of what was discussed.\u201d In August 2019, Mr. Kent had \u201cgrowing concerns that individuals were pushing communications with Ukrainians that had not been discussed and endorsed in the formal policy process.\u201d With respect to President Trump\u2019s request that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Biden, Mr. Kent stated: \u201cI do not believe the U.S. should ask other countries to engage in politically associated investigations and prosecutions.\u201d Asking Ukraine to investigate someone for political reasons \u201cgoes against everything that we are trying to promote in post-Soviet states for the last 28 years, which is the promotion of the rule of law.\u201d After Ambassador Volker raised with a senior aide to President Zelensky that President Trump and Rudy Giuliani were interested in initiating investigations, Mr. Kent said, \u201cthat\u2019s wrong, and we shouldn\u2019t be doing that as a matter of U.S. policy.\u201d In August 16, 2019, Mr. Kent memorialized these conversations in a memorandum, in which he expressed \u201cconcerns that there was an effort to initiate politically motivated prosecutions that were injurious to the rule of law, both Ukraine and U.S.\u201d In September 2019, according to Ambassador Sondland, \u201cPOTUS wanted nothing less than President Zelensky to go to microphone and say investigations, Biden, and Clinton.\u201d Ambassador Sondland was \u201cpushing\u201d for President Zelensky to \u201csend a public signal of announcing a willingness to pursue investigations\u201d in order to \u201cclear the way for both the White House visit as well as the resumption or the clearing of the administrative hold on security assistance,\u201d despite claims by Mr. Morrison and Mr. Sondland that they did not believe the issues were \u201clinked\u201d. The State Department delayed in issuing internal instructions to collect documents in response to the Committees\u2019 September 9 or September 23 letters, or the September 27 subpoena. On October 1, 2019, Mr. Kent alerted the Director General of the Foreign Service and the Acting Legal Adviser of the State Department that Secretary Pompeo\u2019s letter to the Committees, sent earlier that day, was inaccurate. On October 3, 2019, Mr. Kent raised concerns with State Department officials about their delay in responding to the Committees\u2019 subpoena and inaccuracies in Secretary Pompeo\u2019s October 1, 2019, letter to the Committees. Mr. Kent produced all relevant documents in his possession to the State Department. Schiff says Kent corroborates \u201cnumerous\u201d other accounts... and he documented it. The impeachment committees have released a transcript of the deposition of George P Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state who was nominally in charge of Ukraine policy under Trump, but who soon found himself sidelined. Kent is said to have objected strongly to the attack on ambassador Yovanovitch and to the use of an irregular policy channel led by Rudy Giuliani to lead US policy in the region. The transcript is here. We\u2019re reading it now. CNN is reporting on an impeachment timeline that\u2019s shaping up in the House. Looks about right to us: NB: Bill Clinton was impeached on 19 December 1998. Donald Trump might have failed to drag Matt Bevin over the line in Kentucky. But he darn well helped Sean Spicer get into the quarterfinals of this season\u2019s Dancing With the Stars. Spicer, a bald liar who used to be the press secretary, has just sent out an email announcing the big news. As Spicer competed \u2013 can we use that word? \u2013 on Monday night, Trump tweeted to ask people to vote for him. It worked, apparently. Or maybe it was the dancing. Williams, the Pence aide, is done testifying, The Hill reports: A judge in New York orders President Donald Trump to pay $2 million for misusing his charitable foundation, the AP reports. In December 2018, a second New York judge signed off on a deal to shut down Trump\u2019s personal charity after a lawsuit exposed a \u201cshocking pattern of illegality\u201d. Trump had used the charity to pay off legal settlements within his business and even to buy a painting of himself to hang in one of his golf clubs. UPDATE: From a press release from the New York attorney general: The award is part of Attorney General James\u2019 lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation and its directors \u2014 Mr. Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump... Chiefly, Mr. Trump admits to personally misusing funds at the Trump Foundation, and agrees to restrictions on future charitable service and ongoing reporting to the Office of the Attorney General in the event he creates a new charity. The settlements also include mandatory training requirements for Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Finally, the settlements name the charities that will receive the remaining assets of the Trump Foundation as part of its dissolution. \u201cThe Trump Foundation has shut down, funds that were illegally misused are being restored, the president will be subject to ongoing supervision by my office, and the Trump children had to undergo compulsory training to ensure this type of illegal activity never takes place again,\u201d said Attorney General James. \u201cThe court\u2019s decision, together with the settlements we negotiated, are a major victory in our efforts to protect charitable assets and hold accountable those who would abuse charities for personal gain. My office will continue to fight for accountability because no one is above the law \u2014 not a businessman, not a candidate for office, and not even the President of the United States.\u201d Read further: Election Day 2019 is over, but Michelle Obama is still trying to get out the vote, reports the Associated Press: The former first lady announced that Selena Gomez, Liza Koshy, Shonda Rhimes, Megan Rapinoe, Tracee Ellis Ross and Kerry Washington have signed on as co-chairs of the national organization When We All Vote . Obama is already a co-chair, along with Lin-Manuel Miranda, Faith Hill, Tom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson, and basketball star Chris Paul. When We Vote bills itself as a nonpartisan group dedicated to increasing voter participation. The announcement Thursday marks a year until the date of the 2020 elections, which includes the presidential race. The organization was founded in 2018. Hanks said \u201cregistering new voters is an act of hope and taking part in the American idea.\u201d He added that voting guarantees the blessings of \u201cliberty for the grandkids.\u201d Andrew Yang: parent, patriot, not a politician. The longshot Democratic presidential candidate has a TV ad out. Come for the helicopter shots of the Golden Gate bridge, stay for the villain cameo by Mark Zuckerberg; The impeachment witnesses continue to review their depositions. There are enough memories jogging in DC this week to start a track club. Desperate to ensure the flow of military aid from the United States, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had decided to go on CNN and announce the investigations Donald Trump wanted, but at the last minute the plan was cancelled with the exposure in the United States of the Trump plot, the New York Times reports, drawing on Ukrainian sources: Finally bending to the White House request, Mr. Zelensky\u2019s staff planned for him to make an announcement in an interview on Sept. 13 with Fareed Zakaria, the host of a weekly news show on CNN. Though plans were in motion to give the White House the public statement it had sought, events in Washington saved the Ukrainian government from any final decision and eliminated the need to make the statement. The report adds: In Kiev, there is still a debate about whether Mr. Zelensky caved or held out. \u201cThe Zelensky team was ready to make this quid quo pro,\u201d said Mr. Burkovskiy, the analyst. \u201cThey were ready to do this.\u201d But Pavlo Klimkin, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister until a change of government on Aug. 29, said there was no telling what Mr. Zelensky would have ended up saying in the interview, as there were so many versions of a statement under negotiation. An entertaining outtake from last night\u2019s Trump rally in Louisiana: Law prof and impeachment expert Ross Garber points out that Schiff\u2019s statement of the parameters of the inquiry, mentioned earlier, read a lot like draft articles of impeachment: Washington Post editor Marty Baron has replied to an attack by Trump on reporters who wrote a story about the attorney general refusing a Trump request to go before cameras and say Trump\u2019s Zelenskiy phone call was totally copacetic, law-wise: Did you catch Donald Trump Jr shilling for his new book this morning on The View? A top aide to Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer in Iowa has privately offered campaign contributions to local politicians in exchange for endorsing his White House bid, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the conversations, the Associated Press reports: The overtures from Pat Murphy, a former state House speaker who is serving as a top adviser on Steyer\u2019s Iowa campaign, aren\u2019t illegal \u2014 though payments for endorsements would violate campaign finance laws if not disclosed. There\u2019s no evidence that any Iowans accepted the offer or received contributions from Steyer\u2019s campaign as compensation for their backing. But the proposals could revive criticism that the billionaire Steyer is trying to buy his way into the White House. Several state lawmakers and political candidates said they were surprised Steyer\u2019s campaign would think he could buy their support. Tom Courtney, a former Democratic state senator from southeastern Iowa who\u2019s running for reelection to his old seat, told The Associated Press the financial offer \u201cleft a bad taste in my mouth\u201d: Murphy didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Alberto Lammers, Steyer\u2019s campaign press secretary, said Murphy was not authorized to make the offers and that the campaign leadership outside of Iowa was unaware that he was doing so until the issue was raised by The Associated Press. Courtney declined to name Murphy as the Steyer aide who made the offer, but several other local politicians said they received similar propositions, and all confirmed the proposal came from Murphy himself. Most requested anonymity to speak freely about the issue. Another, Iowa state Rep. Karin Derry, said Murphy didn\u2019t explicitly offer a specific dollar amount, but made it clear Derry would receive financial support if she backed Steyer. \u201cIt was presented more as, he has provided financial support to other downballot candidates who\u2019ve endorsed him, and could do the same for you,\u201d she said. Courtney described a similar interaction with Steyer\u2019s campaign. \u201cTom, I know you\u2019re running for Senate. I\u2019m working for Tom Steyer,\u201d Courtney recalled hearing from the aide. \u201cNow you know how this works. ...He said, \u2018you help them, and they\u2019ll help you.\u2019\u201d \u201cI said, \u2018it wouldn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re talking monetary, there\u2019s no amount,\u2019\u201d Courtney continued. \u201cI don\u2019t do that kind of thing.\u201d Lammers, Steyer\u2019s campaign press secretary, said the candidate hasn\u2019t made any individual contributions to local officials in Iowa and won\u2019t be making any this year. In an email, Lammers said Steyer\u2019s endorsements \u201care earned because of Tom\u2019s campaign message,\u201d and distanced the candidate from Murphy. \u201cOur campaign policy is clear that we will not engage in this kind of activity, and anyone who does is not speaking for the campaign or does not know our policy,\u201d Lammers said. The overtures do not appear to have made much of a difference for Steyer. Aside from Murphy\u2019s support, Steyer has received the endorsement of just one Iowan since entering the race in July \u2014 former state Rep. Roger Thomas. In compliance with rules passed last week by the House, Intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff has notified Republicans of a Saturday deadline \u2013 11:20am Saturday, to be exact \u2013 to suggest witnesses to participate in public impeachment hearings starting next week. There is plenty of reason to expect that Republicans will seek to call witnesses designed not to illuminate the inquiry but to create a public circus. Trump champion Jim Jordan, who does not sit on the relevant committee (yet), told reporters he wanted to hear from the whistleblower, who was not a direct witness to the alleged misconduct, but who is the target of an attempt by Trump to cast the inquiry as partisan. But in compliance with the rules, Schiff has now informed Republicans that each witness request \u201cmust be accompanied by a detailed written justification of the relevance to the inquiry of the testimony of each requested witness.\u201d Here are the inquiry\u2019s parameters as laid out by Schiff: Did the President request that a foreign leader and government initiate investigations to benefit the President\u2019s personal political interests in the United States, including an investigation related to the President\u2019s political rival and potential opponent in the 2020 U.S. presidential election? Did the President \u2013 directly or through agents \u2013 seek to use the power of the Office of the President and other instruments of the federal government in other ways to apply pressure on the head of state and government of Ukraine to advance the President\u2019s personal political interests, including by leveraging an Oval Office meeting desired by the President of Ukraine or by withholding U.S. military assistance to Ukraine? Did the President and his Administration seek to obstruct, suppress or cover up information to conceal from the Congress and the American people evidence about the President\u2019s actions and conduct? The House intelligence committee has released a statement saying that former national security adviser John Bolton, a no-show for testimony today, informed the committee that he \u201cwould take us to court if we subpoenaed him.\u201d \u201cThe White House instruction that [Bolton] not appear will add to the evidence of the President\u2019s obstruction of Congress\u201d, the intelligence committee said in a statement obtained by BuzzFeed. But the overarching question of whether the impeachment inquiry will feature a Bolton cameo does not appear to be resolved yet. Bolton informed the committee he would be willing to testify if a court clears the way, the Washington Post reports, citing \u201cpeople familiar with his views\u201d: It remains unclear how quickly that could happen \u2014 and whether it would be in time for Bolton to be called as a witness in the public House impeachment hearings, which are scheduled to begin next week. Previous witnesses have testified that Bolton strongly objected to the mixing of US national security objectives in Ukraine with Donald Trump\u2019s domestic political objectives in 2020. Here is a juicy line from the Post report: if he testified, Bolton \u201cis expected to confirm their statements and describe his conversations with Trump.\u201d This public airing of his willingness-in-principle to confirm the most damning testimony against Trump, juxtaposed with his not actually appearing before congress today, scans like a not-so-subtle demonstration by Bolton to Trump of the power Bolton holds here. But what does Bolton want... Facing a crisis of faith in his leadership in the state department after his perceived failure to protect career diplomats from attacks by the president, Rudy Giuliani and others, secretary of state Mike Pompeo has denied a claim by his former aide that he ignored a request for a statement of support for ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Former Pompeo adviser Michael McKinley testified on 16 October that he had approached Pompeo three times about a statement of support for Yovanovitch, who was the target of a smear campaign in Ukraine led by Giuliani, and who was also singled out by Trump in his 25 July phone call with the Ukrainian president. Here\u2019s a snippet of McKinley\u2019s testimony including a brief Q&amp;A: In presenting my resignation, I made clear that I was looking to leave the Department, I wasn\u2019t looking to create any news story out of it, but that he should be aware that, of course, part of the reason, people were very aware that I was concerned about what I saw as the lack of public support for Department employees. ... Q: And what was the Secretary\u2019s response when you said that? A: On that subject, he did not respond at all, again. Pompeo, who is in Germany, has just flatly denied McKinley\u2019s sworn testimony, the Washington Post reports: Pompeo has a history of misleading statements in the impeachment inquiry so far. When first asked about the Trump-Zelenskiy call, which he had listened to, Pompeo feigned ignorance. Trump is still rage-tweeting about the Washington Post scoop that attorney general William Barr refused a Trump request to go on TV and say a call between Trump and the Ukrainian president definitely, positively did not rise to the level of criminal conduct. \u201cWe both deny this story, which they knew before they wrote it,\u201d Trump tweeted. Barr appears not to have denied the story, except in the dreamscape of Trump\u2019s Twitter, where anything truly is possible. Here\u2019s more than six minutes of footage of vice president Mike Pence officially throwing Donald Trump\u2019s name in the hat for reelection in New Hampshire. \u201cFour more years,\u201d chant the crowd: A no-show on Capitol Hill this morning: John Bolton, the former national security adviser. Bolton\u2019s testimony was requested though not subpoenaed by congressional committees leading the impeachment inquiry. Other witnesses have told the impeachment committees that Bolton vocally objected to the mixing of US national security priorities in Ukraine with Donald Trump\u2019s political priorities in 2020. Bolton ended one meeting with Ukrainians and ambassador Gordon Sondland abruptly, saying \u201cWe don\u2019t do politics here,\u201d according to testimony. He has been quoted as calling Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s emissary, a \u201chand grenade\u201d, and the plot Giuliani advanced a \u201cdrug deal.\u201d In which Hillary Clinton twice in a row does not say she\u2019s not running for president (and then tweets the footage): She does not even say the line about \u201cwe\u2019ve got a really deep and talented field\u201d. Senator Sherrod Brown, seemingly one of the few Democrats who chose not to run for US president, insists he has no regrets but offers a pointed critique of the candidates. Brown told the Guardian on Wednesday: \u201cI think every one of the Democrats running falls short in talking about the dignity of work and honouring and respecting work and looking at the campaign through the eyes of workers and planning to govern through the eyes of workers, and contrasting that with a president who betrays workers every single day, fighting the minimum wage, fighting the overtime rule, appointing judges putting their thumbs on the scale in support of corporations over workers, and that the White House looks like a retreat for Wall Street executives.\u201d Brown was speaking at a Capitol Hill screening of American Factory, the first Obama production to premiere on Netflix, which is set in Ohio, a state that has voted for the eventual presidential winner in every election since 1944 except one (1960). Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton there by eight percentage points but Brown, who represents Ohio, argues that it remains within Democrats\u2019 reach. \u201cI think Ohio is absolutely in play, in part because the president\u2019s made all kinds of commitments to Ohio and he\u2019s betrayed workers day after day after day,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump voters see that, young voters that may not have voted or are just becoming 18 see that in increasing numbers. So it\u2019s a real race in Ohio.\u201d It\u2019s here! It\u2019s here! Emmanuel Macron has said Nato is in the throes of \u201cbrain death\u201d and European countries can no longer rely on the US to defend its allies. \u201cWhat we are currently experiencing is the brain death of Nato,\u201d the French president told the Economist in an interview. \u201cYou have no coordination whatsoever of strategic decision-making between the United States and its Nato allies. None. You have an uncoordinated aggressive action by another Nato ally, Turkey, in an area where our interests are at stake.\u201d Asked whether he still believed in the \u201ccollective defence\u201d stipulations of article five of Nato\u2019s founding treaty, under which an attack against one member is considered an attack against all members, Macron answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Nato \u201conly works if the guarantor of last resort functions as such. I\u2019d argue that we should reassess the reality of what Nato is in the light of the commitment of the United States,\u201d he said. Macron\u2019s questioning of Nato\u2019s effectiveness and suggestion European countries in the 29-member alliance should reassess their situation comes ahead of a key summit with leaders including Donald Trump in the UK early next month. Read the full piece here: Will Gordon Sondland \u2013 the former hotelier who donated $1m to Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, and subsequently was made ambassador to the European Union \u2013 fit under a bus? Defenders of Trump have been testing for the better part of a week now whether they can make Sondland the fall guy in the impeachment probe. A National Security Council official, Tim Morrison, proposed in testimony last week that Sondland\u2019s efforts to extort Ukraine for bad news about Joe Biden were all Sondland\u2019s idea. \u201cI hoped that Ambassador Sondland\u2019s strategy was exclusively his own and would not be considered by leaders in the administration and Congress, who understood the strategic importance of Ukraine to our national security,\u201d Morrison said. But can Sondland be successfully painted as the nefarious mastermind who was behind the \u201cirregular channel\u201d guiding US policy in Ukraine? The notion has been credulously reported in the media. And Senator Lindsey Graham gave it a crack on TV last night: Political strategist Liz Mair notes that Graham is running for reelection in 2020 in a staunchly pro-Trump state. Pence aide Jennifer Williams arrived on schedule this morning for her deposition before the impeachment committees. What did Pence know and when did he know it? He attended a 1 September meeting in Warsaw with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which Zelenskiy immediately brought up suspended military aid, according to testimony, and after which EU ambassador Gordon Sondland, by his own description, pounced on a Zelenskiy aide to say the military aid was not likely to come without an announcement by Zelenskiy of investigations into Biden. Pence, who of course would prefer not to be linked to what John Bolton called a \u201cdrug deal,\u201d has dodged questions about the quid pro quo. What will Williams, a career foreign service officer who also listened to the 25 July phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy, have to say? Before Jeff Sessions jumped into the Alabama senate race this week, Trump sent word to him \u201cthrough allies that he would publicly attack him if he ran,\u201d the New York Times reports. Trump blames Sessions, his first attorney general, for the two-year Russia investigation concluding with the Mueller report, from which Sessions recused himself, properly most analysts believe since Sessions was a top adviser on Trump\u2019s presidential campaign which was under investigation. But Sessions has jumped into the senate race anyway. He happily held an Alabama senate seat for 20 years before his ill-fated turn in the Trump administration. And the race to unseat incumbent Democratic senator Doug Jones in 2020 is wide open on the Republican side. Will Trump make good on his threat to attack Sessions? What will Mitch McConnell advise? Republicans would very much like to regain the Alabama senate seat, which could end Democratic dreams of retaking the senate next year. Donald Trump has been talking with his TV producer pals about life after the presidency and what it could hold, the Daily Beast reports. With Trump\u2019s regular attacks on free and fair elections, the rule of law, executive branch norms, the separation of powers and the free press, not to mention his megalomania, it can seem at times as if he has no intention of ever leaving office \u2013 or at least not on account of paltry details such as an election loss or term limits. But the Beast cites \u201cthree people with knowledge of the situation and another source close to Trump\u201d to report: One of the ideas kicked around by Burnett and the president was shooting a new version of the Trump-branded Apprentice, tentatively titled The Apprentice: White House, and to produce it shortly after the president leaves office. This time, however, the TV program would be explicitly politics-themed and take full advantage of Trump\u2019s status as a former president of the United States and a newfound Republican kingmaker. Read further: Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders unveiled a plan to create \u201ca welcoming and safe America for all\u201d on Thursday morning, promising that on his first day as president he would \u201coverturn all of President Trump\u2019s actions to demonize and harm immigrants on the first day of his presidency.\u201d The plan calls for the breaking up of customs and border protection (CBP) and customs enforcement (ICE). Sanders is the first 2020 candidate to take that stand as part of his official campaign platform. The Sanders plan also calls for a moratorium on deportations, stopping \u201call construction of the racist and ineffective wall on the U.S.-Mexico Border,\u201d overturning \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s racist and disgusting Muslim ban,\u201d and ensuring \u201call children who were separated from their families by the United States government are reunited swiftly.\u201d Sanders would also focus on improving labor conditions in agriculture, food service and other industries that depend on an immigrant workforce. Read all about it. A public defender in the Bronx gives it two thumbs up: The president is laying down fire on Twitter in response to reports that he wanted attorney general William Barr to hold a news conference to say Trump\u2019s 25 July call with the Ukrainian president was not criminal by any stretch. Trump has sent out a pair of tweets claiming that \u201cthe degenerate Washington Post MADE UP the story.\u201d He does not mention the Times\u2019 corroborating report. Now Trump is going on about the whistleblower whose complaint the White House fought for six weeks to prevent Congress from obtaining \u2013 because Trump had done nothing wrong? \u201cRead the transcript,\u201d Trump concludes, referring to a partial transcript of his call with Zelenskiy in which Trump said \u201cthe United States has been very very good to Ukraine\u201d then asked for the \u201cfavor\u201d of investigations into Joe Biden and 2016 election tampering. Evidence that Trump used the power of his office to solicit Ukraine\u2019s interference in the 2020 election goes well beyond the record of the call. That evidence includes the testimony of more than a dozen witnesses before Congress and public statements by Trump, his lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. But also: Read the transcript! Hello and welcome to our politics live blog coverage. Attorney general William Barr has done a lot for Donald Trump. He pre-baked the Mueller report. He is hard at work on a report that is expected to attack the work of US intelligence agencies on which that report was built. He did not recuse himself from a justice department review of a phone call Trump had with the Ukrainian president, despite being mentioned himself on the call. The review, perhaps not surprisingly, found that the call was, legally speaking, peachy. But there are lines, apparently, that even Barr will not cross. The attorney general refused a request by Trump to hold a news conference and declare that no laws were broken in the call, the Washington Post reported late Wednesday in an account backed up by the New York Times. (Correction: we originally had those news organizations reversed; it was a Post scoop.) Trump is a big believer in the power of press conferences. In 2017 he pressured then FBI director James Comey to go on TV and declare he was not a target in the nascent investigation of Russia and the Trump campaign. Comey likewise refused. At the heart of the impeachment inquiry is a demand by Trump that the Ukrainian president \u201cgo to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of [Joe] Biden and 2016 election interference.\u201d Elsewhere, it looks like the congressional committees pursuing an impeachment inquiry against Trump will wangle their second witness of the week today \u2013 out of about a dozen subpoenas and requests on the week. Scheduled to testify is Jennifer Williams, a national security aid to vice president Mike Pence who listened to the 25 July call between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Also invited to testify today, but apparently not planning to appear, is John Bolton, the former national security adviser.
