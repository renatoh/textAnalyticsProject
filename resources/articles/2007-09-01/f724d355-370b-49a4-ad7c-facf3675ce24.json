At least it reassured me the matches I've been watching on BBC2 for the past week were not a figment of my imagination. Should we be surprised so many young women drop out of sport early on? Better coverage of match results would help combat the myth that only men \"do\" football and would say more than dozens of worthy articles telling us we need to take more exercise.
