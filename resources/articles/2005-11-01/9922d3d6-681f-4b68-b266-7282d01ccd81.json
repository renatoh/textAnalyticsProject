Get Me Out Of Here starting on ITV1 tonight, those who envy the 'stars' who humiliate themselves on camera in hotter climes will welcome a new travel concept of 'reality holidays'. The Reality Village, part of the Bravo Club Stintino (www.bravoclub.it) resort in Sardinia, offers a 'reality television experience adventure holiday' to those who want to feel like celebrities without appearing on TV. Teams of guests are filmed facing tasks such as cookery and making a naturist calendar, and the day's winner is rewarded by spending the night in a luxury suite with a chosen contestant."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
