The UK\u2019s largest car manufacturer and Germany\u2019s BMW said they would work together to develop electric motors, transmissions and power electronics in the latest industry alliance formed to address the challenges posed by electric and driverless cars. The two companies would jointly invest in research and development, engineering and procurement to support volume production of electric cars, allowing consumers to shift away from petrol and diesel cars. Nick Rogers, JLR\u2019s engineering director, said the partnership would be mutually beneficial at a time when the car industry was facing \u201cthe greatest technological shift in a generation\u201d. He added: \u201cThe pace of change and consumer interest in electrified vehicles is gathering real momentum and it\u2019s essential we work across industry to advance the technologies required to deliver this exciting future. \u201cWe\u2019ve proven we can build world beating electric cars but now we need to scale the technology to support the next generation of Jaguar and Land Rover products.\u201d Jaguar Land Rover is cutting 4,500 jobs from its global workforce as part of \u00a32.5bn cost-saving programme amid falling sales in China and Europe and record losses of \u00a33.4bn in the last three months of 2018. BMW, meanwhile, is trying to cut costs by \u20ac12bn and has warned that profits will fall this year. The huge costs to carmakers of developing electric vehicles come at a time when regulators are tightening the rules on emissions. Last month Fiat Chrysler and Renault announced plans for a \u20ac33bn merger in a move that would create the world\u2019s third-largest carmaker, saving the companies the billions needed to fund the race to make electric and autonomous vehicles. BMW was one of the first major carmakers to launch a fully electric car, with the i3 hitting the market in 2013. JLR also has an electric car, the Jaguar i-Pace, and both companies have a range of plug-in hybrid models. Klaus Froehlich, a BMW board member, said: \u201cTogether, we have the opportunity to cater more effectively for customer needs by shortening development time and bringing vehicles and state-of-the-art technologies more rapidly to market.\u201d Engineers from JLR and BMW will work together to design the components, which will then be made at their manufacturing sites. For JLR, this will be at its engine plant in Wolverhampton, which employs 1,600 people."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
