John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, announced proposals for an unprecedented expansion of the central bank\u2019s role at the heart of policymaking, with officials at Threadneedle Street supporting the Treasury in checking on progress towards carbon targets. McDonnell said the Bank\u2019s governor would also join the next Labour chancellor on a sustainable investment board to oversee lending to British businesses with the aim of boosting productivity. Speaking to City executives in central London on Monday, McDonnell said Labour planned to conduct a review of City practices and how investments could be directed to promote technologies that cut carbon emissions. The review would focus on the shadow banking sector, where borrowing and lending takes place beyond the oversight of regulators. It will report by October as part of Labour\u2019s plans for a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d. McDonnell said: \u201cI am setting up a review group to overview the financial system as it currently relates to the climate emergency, in terms of both where and how it is causing or exacerbating the problem of climate change and where and how it could be providing solutions to problems.\u201d He repeated his warning that firms listed on the London Stock Exchange that failed to meet environmental targets risked being denied access to the main equity market, forcing them to become private businesses or list in other jurisdictions. \u201cThis means that when we delist companies that fail to meet environmental criteria from the London Stock Exchange, investors can be confident that their money is not going on making the world uninhabitable for their children,\u201d McDonnell said. Labour has already set out wide-ranging plans for a network of regional banks and an enhanced post office network to promote investment. McDonnell said these institutions would be given the dual role of increasing investment in green technologies and making a profit. The shadow Treasury team has already met representatives from Extinction Rebellion, the radical environmental protest group, to hear their ideas for addressing the climate crisis. Proposals from the independent Committee on Climate Change, headed by the former Tory minister John Gummer, and from the National Infrastructure Commission have already played a large part in Labour\u2019s thinking, McDonnell said. However, while Labour has committed to the target of reducing carbon emissions to net zero by at least 2050, in line with the government\u2019s aim, there are few policy details to say how it would get there. The review of the City would include commercial banks, investment banks, pension funds, hedge funds, private equity and asset managers to cover areas of the City that often escape scrutiny. Labour has put together a panel to review how the government and the Bank\u2019s new responsibilities can be implemented, including the former head of the civil service Lord Kerslake and the prominent City lawyer Peter Rice. \u201cThe UK is and will remain a hub for finance,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cThat gives us all the more responsibility to make sure that the lending that takes place here aids the tackling of the climate crisis rather than fuelling it.\u201d Labour plans to offer a mix of stiffer regulation and tax incentives to promote \u201clarge-scale beneficial investment\u201d to support growth. \u201cBut we will also fulfil our responsibility to ensure adequate policing of investments using the mechanisms available to us to require companies to live up to their climate change responsibilities,\u201d McDonnell said. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee currently sets Britain\u2019s interest rates while its financial policy committee and the Prudential Regulatory Authority oversee the financial stability of the banking sector and City firms. An expansion of the bank\u2019s role to encompass promoting investment and higher levels of productivity while separately supporting Labour\u2019s decarbonisation of the economy would make it the most powerful independent central bank in the developed world. Responding to questions about Labour\u2019s stance on Brexit, McDonnell said he would prefer to campaign to remain in a referendum or general election despite representing a constituency that voted to leave the EU."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
