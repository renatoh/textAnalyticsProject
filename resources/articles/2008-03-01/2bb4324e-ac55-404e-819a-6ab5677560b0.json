It's not been a secret: because it involved choosing a 6 megapixel machine rather than the 10MP D40x, I wrote a column about it: It pays to think big with digital camera sensors. One reason I didn't hang about was that I was going to Microsoft's TechFest 08 in Redmond, and my first Nikon D40 image appeared in the printed paper on Thursday, with a brief report: It's GeoLife, Jim, but not as we know it. The picture is not on Guardian Unlimited, but it's the one at the top of this post, full frame. In the column, writing about the difference between the 10MP and 6MP versions of what are essentially the same camera, I observed: \"You should see a difference if you print pictures bigger than 11 x 8 inches, but you won't see it on screen or in the Technology section.\" I guess I was right in this case. The printed image was cropped to one inch wide and less than an inch deep, providing an available resolution of 1,000 pixels per inch! In the picture, Feng Zhao is holding up the circuit board from one of the sensors he's using in sensornets -- small web-based wireless sensors that work together using mesh networking. They could also be used for home automation -- attached to or built into windows, smoke alarms etc -- to make the world greener while also providing Microsoft Live services with a way to make money without having users click adverts. (Though I should also add that this is research: there are no such Live services and there may never be any. OK, it's speculation.) Microsoft Research has a lot more projects that don't actually need new sensors, they are based on using mobile phones. The GeoLife mentioned in the title is one example: it can trace someone's route across Beijing. (That's where the server is; it would work anywhere.) Another project we didn't have room for is using software to exploit the tiny accelerometers built into a growing number of handheld devices. Ramachandran Ramjee and Prashanth Mohan from MSR Bangalore were demonstrating their prototype using a radio-controlled car and HP iPaq-3's. The handheld screen told you when you braked or hit a pothole in the road, for example. I had to ask the obvious: \"If I've braked, I don't need my phone to tell me that, so what's the point?\" Well, having a record could help me plan future routes, and the anonymised data can be used to annotate a map for social purposes. It could, for example, highlight bad bits of road and chaotic junctions, of which Bangalore apparently has many. Also, \"In the future, phones might be able to detect pollution and other things that we could incorporate,\" said the researchers. I suggested they walk the 3 yards to where Feng Zhao was showing Tiny Web devices that could be built into cars or scattered around the environment...."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
