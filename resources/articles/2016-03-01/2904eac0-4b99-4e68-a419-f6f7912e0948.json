Don\u2019t read on if you haven\u2019t. Every episode of The Night Manager has had its moments of admirable tension, but in this one you realise: tension is not the same thing as fear. Or cruelty. Or horror. And finally, we\u2019re face to face with them all. Until now, the balmy climate and glamour has masked the evil of what Richard Roper\u2019s doing: we\u2019ve been shielded from its full ugliness, so we\u2019ve been seduced in the same way Pine has been, enjoying the spoils of war without having to look at any of what war spoils. Lists of weaponry are intriguing when you\u2019re sat by the pool, but you can always just go for another dip. Now we\u2019re near the Turkish border with Syria, surrounded by refugees; Susanne Bier has replaced the pastel postcard tones of Mallorca with a grimier palette. And at long last Hugh Laurie, whose charm seemed to be bottomless, has lost interest in making us like him. Roper is showing his teeth. The real Roper He comes out in increments. First on the private jet, letting Pine know that he thinks there\u2019s a mole, assessing his new confidant with the practised skepticism he might apply to a fresh batch of cluster bombs: not predisposed to ditch them, but certainly not sentimental enough to do anything else if he finds a flaw. \u201cAnyone can betray anyone, Jonathan,\u201d he says. \u201cYou should know that.\u201d At this point I\u2019d just take my chances and jump out at 30,000ft, but Pine is made of sterner stuff. On we go, then, to the Haven, Roper\u2019s military \u201ckingdom\u201d, as Sandy puts it, where he explains away his philanthropic cover without the slightest hint of self-deception or humanity, and states his radical capitalist worldview in the bluntest possible terms: \u201cWhen a continent enters into chaos, that\u2019s when opportunities open up.\u201d Then it\u2019s the fireworks show, a display of military might so improbable and overdone that it ought to be absurd \u2013 a fleet of remote control warplanes would surely be more sellable than the munitions he uses to destroy them \u2013 except that Roper\u2019s face, lit up by the explosions, takes on a kind of messianic peace. \u201cNothing quite as pretty as napalm at night,\u201d he says \u2013 but because this pseudo-affable tone is filtered through the poolside bonhomie we\u2019re accustomed to, you find yourself wondering if this isn\u2019t an ironic mode at all \u2013 if he really means it. As the villages burn below, it all looked quite plausibly like hell, the ringmaster puffing away on a cigar up above. Worse remains. His assault on Jed, and the suffocating embrace that follows, remind us that his love will never snuff out the possibility of ruthless violence. As he holds her close in the moonlight, something in the way it\u2019s shot makes it seem as if he\u2019s resting his gaunt face on the shoulder of a skeleton: not for the first time, I thought of Dorian Grey, or Faustus, the bon vivant, the cost of whose misdeeds can be hidden but not erased. And, as ever with Roper, the worst of all was enacted under his command but never in his presence \u2013 the murder of a bereaved father and son. \u201cSome local issue had to be dealt with,\u201d Frisky tells Pine. \u201cChief\u2019s orders. He doesn\u2019t like to leave traces.\u201d There is a trace, though, on Pine, who tried to stop it, and Jed, who had to hear it. Roper seems entirely unsullied, playing golf in his dressing gown and desert boots under the Turkish night sky. Moron seeks a mole There is, still, one glitch in our vision of Roper as the worst man in the world, which is this: put him in a kitchen with a puppy and a ravaged steak and I suspect that he would blame the chef. I KNOW WE HAVE TO GO WITH IT and this is said from a place of affection, but come on! He knows he has a mole, and he knows the mole started to do its work since he hired a man he knew only from a hotel lobby and an incident in which his son was apparently being abducted. Faced with this man, two long-standing confidantes steeped in blood and his wide-eyed girlfriend, and he decides they are all equally suspicious. When the new guy bludgeons the man who had until recently been his closest lieutenant to death (so long, Corky, you will be much missed), he takes the survivor\u2019s uncorroborated word about how the fight went down. For a man who is only sentimental about his darling son, he appears oddly unalive to the idea that the dashing young buck might be more appealing to his girlfriend than his old bones are; and when the surprise armament switcheroo transpires, he sees nothing amiss in this young buck\u2019s blatant show of dismay. Two possibilities remain. Roper, for all his wickedness, is also incredibly stupid, at risk of losing his steak to a puppy because he doesn\u2019t have the stomach to drown it; or he is smarter than everyone, playing a long game that will only become clear in the finale, and knowingly using Limpet\u2019s investigations to his own advantage. I hope it\u2019s the latter. If not, my recollection of his most fantastically sinister lines will always come in the voice of Bertie Wooster. Back to Cairo Slow-witted though he may have been in this regard, you have to hand it to him: in every other respect, Roper\u2019s victory in this penultimate episode has been complete. For a moment, had you not known there was an episode more to come, you might have thought that Pine would prevail and spirit Jed away, that Burr would emerge victorious over Roper and watch from afar as American soldiers exposed his convoy of weaponry for what it was. But those prospects were simply dangled before us so that they might be more agonisingly snatched away. And it only appears to be getting worse. With satisfying circularity, Pine is being taken back to Cairo and to the Nefertiti hotel; as he stood in the lobby and wondered whether he might bump into any old friends, I felt a sympathetic vein in my forehead throb at the stress of it. At long last Samira\u2019s ghost haunted him again, raising troubling questions about Jed\u2019s prospects for survival. (They remain disappointingly interchangeable figures, never really more than pawns in the violent games of the men who lust after them.) Before long we will be back in the company of Freddie Hamid. Will Pine be able to gain absolution without another traumatic loss? Will Burr succeed in tearing the British establishment down? Will Roper turn out to be quite as dense as he currently appears? The questions that the Night Manager has been painstakingly teeing up for weeks are finally on the verge of being answered, and I have faith that the conclusions will be as explosive as this unsettling, unlikely, sexy and endlessly riveting story deserves. Notes and observations The Burr household was a nicely withheld location: I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve visited an ordinary domestic environment before. And if her dozing husband did ruin my fairly implausible theory that she and Roper were Le Carre\u2019s answer to the Macbeths, it was a nice touch that he was reading Robert Harris\u2019s Fatherland: not a bad thriller writer, sure, but he\u2019s got nothing on the master. You don\u2019t hear the word \u201contology\u201d enough in primetime drama. It took me a minute to work out what on earth Dromgoole was talking about, but I\u2019m glad his no-doubt-grand education didn\u2019t go to waste. I have nagging questions about Jed. A bit like the way Roper\u2019s blindness makes you hope for a grand twisty justification in the finale, I wonder if she\u2019s going to turn out to be a proper spy herself, maybe for David Harewood\u2019s Steadman. The question of why she was snooping in Roper\u2019s office herself, after all, has never been satisfactorily answered. Nice to see that the Duchess of York has found work as a Limpet agent! One of my favourite lines belonged to Sandy, when he was congratulating Roper on the decoy run at the Syrian border: \u201cYou are a very bad man!\u201d It was said like a joke, accompanied by a feeble high five \u2013 one public school boy to another, deploying a tone of camp distance to make their mundane exploits seem more exciting. Except \u2013 Roper is a very bad man, and Sandy knows it; this tone is the way he can tell the truth without really stopping to think about it. I really like how the show repurposes the ironies of ordinary life as a straightforward account of something much worse.
