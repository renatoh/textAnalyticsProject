But there is a touch of sour, which is nice. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Sainsbury's Basics Full Flavour Cheddar \u00a37.29/kg The sourness is there but it's lacking any real flavour. Although it's less salty than the others, which is good. \u2605\u2605 Waitrose Essential English Cheddar 180g, \u00a31.59 This is too salty, so salty that it's by far the strongest flavour that's coming through. \u2605\u2605 The Co-operative Simply Value Mild White Cheddar 800g, \u00a35.88 Definitely a mild cheddar. It's too mild though, so there's not nearly enough flavour. \u2605\u2605 Tomato soup Waitrose Essential Cream of Tomato Soup 400g, 59p Oh this is nice! It's very rich and tastes like it has butter in it. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Sainsbury's Basics Creamed Tomato Soup 400g, 24p A velvety smooth soup. I can actually taste the tomatoes in it too. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Tesco Everyday Value Tomato Soup 400g, 24p This one has a lovely smooth texture but I'm not really getting much of the tomatoes coming through. \u2605\u2605 Morrisons M Savers Tomato Soup 400gp, 30p This one has a good flavour but unfortunately it's far too sour. \u2605\u2605 Sausages Tesco Everyday Value 8 Pork Sausages 454g, 61p These are well-seasoned so have a really rich flavour. They also have a chewy outside, which I like. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Morrisons M Savers 20 Thick Sausages 1kg, \u00a31 These are very nice. There's not as much flavour but they have a lovely texture. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Budgens Daily Basics 8 Sausages 454g, \u00a31.09 Not much flavour going on here but with a bit of ketchup you'd never know. \u2605\u2605 Waitrose Essential British Pork Sausages 454g, \u00a31.39 Salty, far too salty; it's all I can taste. Not good. \u2605 Strawberry jam Waitrose Essential Strawberry Jam 454g, 80p I really like this one: it's fruity, rich and not too sweet. BEST BUY \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Tesco Everyday Value Strawberry Jam 454g, 35p This isn't bad \u2013 you can actually taste the strawberries. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Sainsbury's Basics Strawberry Jam 454g, 29p This is both sweet and sour. Would be good with pork, I'm not sure about on toast though. \u2605\u2605 Morrisons M Savers Strawberry Jam 454g, 60p Super sweet, and not in a good way. Not sure there's any fruit going on in here. \u2605 Baked beans Marks &amp; Spencer Simply Value Baked Beans 410g, 41p Definitely my favourite. The sauce is nice and rich and the beans aren't too grainy. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Tesco Everyday Value Baked Beans 420g, 28p These aren't quite as tomatoey as I would like but the beans are OK. \u2605\u2605\u2605 The Co-operative Simply Value Baked Beans 410g, 28p The beans are a lovely texture but they are pretty flavourless. \u2605\u2605 Sainsbury's Basics Beans in Tomato Sauce 420g, 28p The beans are bigger, which is good but the flavour is bad, and tastes slightly astringent. \u2605 Sliced bread Waitrose Essential White Medium Sliced Bread 800g, 80p Best of a bad bunch, only because it's less salty, but none of these loaves really seem like bread to me. \u2605 Sainsbury's Basics White Sliced Bread 800g, 50p Completely tasteless, though no more than the rest of them. \u2605 Tesco Everyday Value Sliced White Bread 800g, 47p The dough is awful, sour and claggy. no stars Morrisons M Savers White Loaf 800g, 50p This is horrendous. I don't know what else to say. no stars Lorraine Pascale's Fast, Fresh and Easy Food (RRP \u00a320) is available for \u00a316 with free UK p&amp;p fromthe Guardian Bookshop"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
