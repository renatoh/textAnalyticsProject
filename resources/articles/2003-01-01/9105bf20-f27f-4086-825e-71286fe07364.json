He also showed a prototype of the new Media2Go platform -- multimedia 20GB handhelds (of the sort Apple didn't launch) which will be made initially by Sanyo, Samsung, ViewSonic and I-River -- and he played Xbox Live against Shaq O'Neal. Ashley Norris reports for the Guardian here. AP and IDG News also have reports. Microsoft has posted a transcript of the speech, so you can get more of the flavour. Gates also did a short interview with Business Week on SPOT."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
