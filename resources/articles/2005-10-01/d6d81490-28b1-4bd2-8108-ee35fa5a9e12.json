The gap between his salary cheques as a computer programmer widened. Result? He went into the red by some \u00a3300 for three weeks at Abbey National in late 2003. The bank's result? It took \u00a31,491 from him over the next 13 months in penalty payments. But now he's back in the black, having forced the bank to refund all the penalties. \"They took \u00a3500 in the first month, and the debt just ran into each new month so there were more fines,\" says Dave, 32, from Tonbridge, left. \"I was fined for each payment from the account. I have a \u00a33 a month standing order to the Children's Society. \"The Abbey bounced that, costing me \u00a332. Then they paid it but charged me \u00a330. So the charity got \u00a33 and Abbey \u00a362.\" Dave then challenged similar charges from HFC Bank which backed down after pressure from the ombudsman. \"After that, I could not believe Abbey had the right to do this. I investigated punitive charges on the net and found \"bankchargeshell.co.uk\" he says. He twice wrote to Abbey saying the charges were unenforceable at law. Abbey disagreed. Then he paid \u00a3220 for a small claims court summons. Abbey's eventual response was to state the charges were a reflection of administration costs and not punitive. The bank pressured him to drop the summons. He held firm: \"I dropped my statutory interest demands to help them save some face.\" The bank finally agreed and, earlier this month, sent him \u00a31,711 in full and final settlement just days before the court hearing was due. \"They relied on me rolling over. They wanted a confidentiality agreement. I refused. I also got \u00a3180 back from Smile using the same tactics.\" Abbey told Guardian Money: \"We assess each case on an individual basis.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
