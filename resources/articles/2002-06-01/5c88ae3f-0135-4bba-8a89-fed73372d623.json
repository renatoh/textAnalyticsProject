Had the impact been a few inches further back, he might have lost a rear wheel and with it victory, but instead he lurched on to the road and his barren 12-month spell was ended with the first Acropolis rally hat-trick by any driver and a share of the record of 24 world championship wins. It was achieved under considerable pressure in Itea, a town 120 miles north of Athens. Peugeot's Marcus Gronholm tore chunks from McRae's lead on the first two of yesterday's four special stages. But McRae kept the Finn at arm's length and the 25 seconds between the two was the time Gronholm lost when he skidded into a field on Friday. McRae admitted he had been lucky. Apart from bouncing off the tree, he was making no impression on his team-mate Markko Martin until he collected a puncture on Saturday. \"We really needed to win and it came at the right time,\" McRae said. \"It's nice to have the most wins, but the championship points are far more important.\" McRae was indebted to Burns. The world champion lost second place when his rear suspension collapsed, but by pulling over he made sure McRae was not held up. It was a sporting gesture, but although Gronholm is a team-mate, Burns will not object to the Finn's championship lead being cut."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
