Mr Hampton's tour of the big City institutions could begin as soon as this week and is thought to include new pay deals for all the top executives as well as store managers. The new schemes are intended to link pay closely to performance and provide a major incentive to more junior levels of management. The remuneration of Justin King, the new chief executive, is believed to be only one component of the schemes which are thought to have been devised by Carol Arrowsmith, the head of Deloitte &amp; Touche's executive remuneration advisory team. Ms Arrowsmith sorted out the pay row at GlaxoSmithKline. She was brought in by Mr Hampton after his appointment as chairman. He replaced Sir Peter Davis who was ousted over a \u00a32.3m bonus which shareholders did not believe he was entitled to. The row over Sir Peter's pay also led to a shake-up in the boardroom and Bob Stack, the new head of the remuneration committee and a Cadbury Schweppes executive, is now expected to play an important role in discussions with investors. About 28% of Sainsbury's shares are held by members of the eponymous family and only a handful of City institutions hold sizable stakes, such as Legal &amp; General and Barclays Global Investors. US investor Brandes is the largest holder outside the Sainsbury family with more than 9% of the shares. The nature of the Sainsbury shareholder register has led to some concerns that investors will find it difficult to influence the company. However, one said: \"The corporate governance debate in this country has shown that investors will stand up if something needs to be done.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
