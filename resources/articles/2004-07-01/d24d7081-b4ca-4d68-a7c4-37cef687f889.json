Travelling with Mr Jenkins, who both the American and the North Korean governments allege deserted in January 1965 while on patrol on the border between North and South Korea, were his daughters, Mika, 21, and Belinda, 18. His wife and their mother, Hitomi Soga, was kidnapped by North Korea in 1978 and was not allowed to leave until May 2002. She was waiting for them at a secluded corner of the runway at Jakarta's international airport. The unlikely venue was chosen because Indonesia has no extradition treaty with the US. Mr Jenkins, 64, had said he feared arrest and deportation if he went to Japan. His family claims he was kidnapped and brainwashed. The reunion, which took place at the bottom of the steps of the aircraft that the Japanese government had chartered to take the three out of North Korea, began with Ms Hitomi giving her husband a passionate kiss and then a long hug. She then turned to her daughters, who were in tears as they came down the steps, and embraced them both. Earlier, as she watched them leave Pyongyang on television, she said, according to a Japanese embassy statement, that her husband \"looks more cheerful than I thought\". Her daughters, she was quoted as saying, \"appear more fashionable now because they're wearing earrings\". The first taste of the outside world for Mr Jenkins and his daughters was a two-hour crawl through the Jakarta evening rush hour to a five-star hotel. There they were greeted by 200 journalists and dozens of well-wishers. Dressed in a dark grey suit, Mr Jenkins strode purposefully into the lobby. He said he was \"very happy\" to be in Indonesia. When asked what he felt about leaving North Korea he said: \"I can't ... there's no comment.\" Mika and Belinda had spent the flight from North Korea watching first a video message from their mother, which they found \"deeply moving\" according to a Japanese embassy official, and then cartoons. Mr Jenkins reportedly ate little as he is suffering from a stomach complaint which has caused him to be hospitalised several times in the last few years. During most of his almost 40 years in North Korea he taught English. He also appeared in several propaganda films, starring as an American spy. His daughters looked overwhelmed by the attention on their first trip outside North Korea. Mika snapped out of her stupor when they were each presented with a large bouquet of tiger lilies by Indonesian children. She bent down, and gave the little boy a kiss on the cheek and a big smile. There is no word on how long the family will stay in Jakarta or where they will go next. A Japanese embassy official said Ms Soga, who arrived from Japan on Thursday, was \"travelling light\" and hoped to return with her family to Japan. That is unlikely to happen any time soon, however, because, according to the official, the negotiations between Tokyo and Washington to ensure Mr Jenkins is not arrested are \"in diplomatic deadlock\". The family's plight has gripped Japan. Ms Soga was one of numerous Japanese abducted by Pyongyang to teach its spies Japanese. She was one of five abductees who returned to Japan in 2002 after the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, won them a temporary trip home during a visit to North Korea."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
