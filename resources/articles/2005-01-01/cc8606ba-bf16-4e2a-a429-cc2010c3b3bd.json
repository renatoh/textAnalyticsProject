There are only four pages dedicated to the carnival, but then there's lots to cram in to just 264 A6-sized pages. It doesn't allow space for much detail, which means all you get on recommended bars and restaurants is the name, address, telephone number, price bracket and a few well-chosen words. It's enough to get an idea, though. There's a handy two-page language glossary and 10 pages of easy-to-follow maps at the back, also more detailed sections dotted about on subjects from favelas (city slums) to essential Rio beach kit. According to the latter, if you want to do it the Brazilian way, guys should be sporting nothing but a sunga, a tiny piece of square Lycra, and ladies need to invest in a tanga, a minuscule bikini. Be warned, however, that if you are brave enough to dress as skimpily as the bronzed and buffed locals, you won't have anywhere to carry your guide - even a handily pocket-sized one like this! \u00b7 Footprint Rio de Janeiro is published by Footprint Books."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
