An FA spokesman said Giggs and Ronaldo had been found guilty of improper conduct and fined \u00a37,500 pounds and \u00a34,000 respectively. Both players escaped bans, although they were warned over their future conduct. Last month the FA fined Arsenal and several of their players a total of \u00a3275,000 for their involvement in the incidents on September 21, which flared up after Ruud van Nistelrooy missed a controversial late penalty in the 0-0 draw at Old Trafford. Four Arsenal players - Patrick Vieira, Martin Keown, Ray Parlour and Lauren - also received suspensions totalling nine games. Following the punishment of Arsenal, United manager Alex Ferguson suggested that the London club had done \"a deal\" with the FA to avoid the possibility of a points deduction. Ferguson, who was also handed a two-match touchline ban and \u00a310,000 fine in October for abusing a match official in the game against Newcastle United in September, was subsequently asked to explain his comments to the FA. United defender Rio Ferdinand also faces misconduct charges at an FA disciplinary hearing on December 18-19th following his failure to turn up for a routine drugs test at the club's training ground on September 23rd."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
