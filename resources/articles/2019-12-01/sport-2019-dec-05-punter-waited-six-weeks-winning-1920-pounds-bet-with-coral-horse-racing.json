The punter understood that he had placed two bets, both for \u00a350 each-way, on Keith Dalgleish\u2019s filly Ventura Destiny at 14-1 before a race at Newcastle on 25 October. A unique \u201creceipt ID\u201d appeared alongside each stake in his betting history, along with a record of the time when it had been placed via the Racing Post\u2019s mobile app. Ventura Destiny won at 16-1, and since the punter\u2019s account receives the \u201cBest Odds Guaranteed\u201d concession, the bets should have returned \u00a31,920 in winnings. However, the money was not credited to his account. The punter then received an email from Coral three hours after the race which stated both bets had been refused by Coral\u2019s traders due to their size. When the punter complained to Coral, he says that he was told he would receive a response in 14 days. That deadline was subsequently extended three times by Coral, which had still not resolved the punter\u2019s complaint when contacted for comment by the Guardian on Wednesday. On Thursday afternoon, however, the punter received an email informing him that the bet would be paid in full. Simon Clare, PR director for Ladbrokes Coral, said on Thursday: \u201cWe are investigating the matter and it does look as if a technical error in the Racing Post App bet acceptance process has led to the customer being sent a bet receipt as if the bet has been accepted, when in fact it has not been accepted in the system. \u201cWe will this afternoon be contacting the customer directly to resolve the issue and make payment of the returns for the bet that he believed had been placed. The investigation into what caused this scenario is continuing, and if we find other customers that have been affected, we will make similar resolution.\u201d Ibas, the Independent Betting Adjudication Service, has still to rule on a number of cases brought by Ladbrokes customers following a series of complaints involving \u201ccancelled\u201d bets in 2018. All the cases involved bets which were assigned a unique receipt number, while the balance of the punter\u2019s account was apparently debited by the correct amount. The bets, which had been referred to the trading department for approval, were then listed as having been \u201ccancelled\u201d rather than simply refused or declined. Ladbrokes conceded in December 2018 that a \u201ctechnical glitch\u201d had affected a number of its customers and made payments \u201cas a gesture of goodwill\u201d to some of those whose cancelled bets would have been winners. The Guardian also disclosed last year that the firm had reached out-of-court settlements with at least four clients who has encountered the same issue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
