But he implies that the new code has added to the \"cat's cradle of confusion\". The purpose of a code of conduct is to reinforce public trust in public institutions, such as government, and so to help counter the cynicism that can be so corrosive to the political process. It does this in two ways. It tells every public office-holder the standard of ethical behaviour to follow. Equally important, it tells members of the public the standard of behaviour which they can expect from public office-holders. The committee has emphasised that for codes to be successful, there need to be adequate compliance mechanisms, if public confidence is to be maintained. For special advisers, there is specific guidance. It makes clear that responsibility for dealing with any alleged breaches lies with the departmental minister and the permanent secretary. The key questions are whether those procedures operate in a way that maintains public confidence; and if not, what should be done about them. When the committee published the stock-take of the committee's past seven reports on September 10, I said that - amongst other things - the committee would want to think about whether the new code on special advisers and the newly revised ministerial code went far enough. In doing so, we shall certainly pay attention to the adequacy of the processes for dealing with alleged breaches. Nigel Wicks Chair, committee on standards in public life \u00b7 On Sunday, a Labour minister dares take on the shareholders of Railtrack by standing up for the public interest. By the end of the week, after a series of leaked accusations, he is fighting for his political life. A chance connection? I don't think so - its always worth asking exactly whose interest is served by such leaks, and time for people, especially those who claim to be on the left, to work out whose side we should be on.
