Clown, hero, braggart and battering ram are just a handful of the commonest. Given his volatile personality and the fact that Russia's first elected president played so dominant a role in his country's path from communism, it is time he received more weighty treatment. Timothy Colton, professor of government and Russian studies at Harvard University, certainly has the credentials. His book is backed by a tremendous amount of research, including declassified material from the Soviet archives. With his outward bluster, mood swings, speeches and three autobiographical memoirs, Yeltsin was never an easy person to interpret. In abandoning the Communist party and building Russia up against the Soviet Union, was he motivated largely by grudges - particularly as a result of insults he felt he had received from Mikhail Gorbachev - or did he have a sustained vision of reform? Vanity always seemed to push him to emphasise status over substance, so was he a one-man band who operated largely by instinct or did he consult advisers and plan his tactics? Colton provides plenty of evidence on these issues, including Yeltsin's two flirtations with suicide, his frequent lengthy disappearances into depression and melancholy, and of course his drunkenness. He describes Yeltsin as a man who never broke from his background as a provincial party boss, finding it hard to make and keep friends, listen to colleagues or discuss alternative courses of action with them. He had come to Moscow in 1985 \"with a two-ton chip on his shoulder\" because the party leadership had not offered him a better job. Colton quotes Andrei Sakharov, the nuclear physicist who became Russia's great human rights activist, as describing Yeltsin as a man \"of a completely different [lesser] calibre than Gorbachev\". Later, Sakharov softened his view: \"I don't understand how Yeltsin arrives at his decisions, but he usually arrives at the right answer.\" That quotation is an apt summary of this book. Colton's researches end with no firm conclusions on how Yeltsin made his choices and what the debates in his entourage were. There was controversy aplenty among those whom the decisions affected, yet we get little flavour of the anger or excitement which raged in Russia's parliament and the media, and of course on the street. Colton sides with Yeltsin on most issues; he minimises the massive TV bias and use of bribes and pressure on local get-out-the-vote politicians which gave Yeltsin victory in the 1996 election. He writes from a top-down perspective, showing no feel for the huge social and economic changes which impoverished millions of Russians before the oil price went up in Putin's time. The narrative is curiously flat. The two most dramatic episodes in Yeltsin's career are hurried over. His use of tanks in 1993 to storm the Russian parliament, which he had unconstitutionally disbanded, is dealt with in just two of the book's 456 pages of text. Even what is usually considered Yeltsin's finest hour - mounting a tank and defying the plotters who had put Gorbachev under house arrest in August 1991 - gets no more than six pages. The most interesting element in Colton's treatment of the August drama centres on the plotters. While they planned the coup, Vladimir Kryuchkov, the KGB chief, thought he could convince Yeltsin to join them. When the coup was launched, an order was made for Yeltsin's arrest. Kryuchkov then revoked it after Anatoly Lukyanov, the Soviet parliament's chairman, who had sided with the coup, gave his view that Yeltsin would discredit himself in the eyes of the public if he opposed the coup's \"imposition of order\". Their judgment turned out to be dramatically wrong, but it was based on a sense that Yeltsin's credentials as a democrat and a reformer were ambiguous. On the key question of what motivated Yeltsin to embrace the \"Russia-firstism\" and the \"parade of sovereignties\" which undermined the Soviet Union, Colton rejects the view of Gorbachev's supporters who say it was a device to oust Gorbachev by shooting his horse from under him. Colton sees the trend as due in part to \"contagion from nationalist movements in the Baltics and elsewhere\". He reminds us that, paradoxically, it was the communists in the Russian parliament who first proposed a motion to declare sovereignty. There was xenophobia all round. Yeltsin's behaviour on this issue followed a familiar pattern. He was not so much a man who created historic opportunities as one who exploited them. It was Gorbachev who opened the way to contested elections for parliament. Yeltsin grabbed the chance, and saw how becoming a populist could make him a public star and a political force. It was nationalists in the Baltics who first raised the banner of sovereignty. Yeltsin saw it as a stepping stone to power. Of course he also felt both changes would make people's lives better. Perhaps the most accurate verdict on Russia's two big men is that events were moving so fast that neither was in control. Yeltsin was just a better surfer than Gorbachev when the breaking waves loomed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
