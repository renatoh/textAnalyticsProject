I think Joe went to the first one in 1971, and he used to go most years, long before I met him. He just loved it for the spirit - it was the music, obviously, but he just loved meeting people. He was always a bit of a hippy. His idea of heaven was to stump around and talk to people at campfires, or invite them to his, and just talk. He used to look after people - he was very good at bringing in the strange-looking or the lost. He would come back and write - it was incredibly inspirational for him. He didn't really like to play Glastonbury, for the simple reason that he loved it as a festivalgoer. And Glastonbury was something that he looked forward to every single year. The preparation that would go on beforehand - the tent-buying, the poles, the flags ... everything was like a military operation. I was just so touched that Michael [Eavis] wanted to do the memorial stone for Joe. I think it's beautiful. Joe adored the stones there, he has always enjoyed standing stone circles, wherever. He knew an awful lot about them, he was just fascinated by them. So it's wonderful that Michael's done this. His stone is in the Lost Vagueness field, which was Joe's favourite field at Glastonbury. There's a lovely old man there, who he spent a lot of time with last year. He turns up with an old wind-up gramophone that plays jazz records and 78s. Joe would just spend hours talking to him and sitting with him while he played his music. There are wonderful moments at Glastonbury when you just look round the campfire and see an incredibly eclectic mix of people there. Everybody's half asleep because it's dawn, and there's Joe still up, putting pillows under people's heads and running off to get breakfast and a flagon of pear cider to keep everybody going. Joe never had the sort of fame of someone like Bono - Bono could never walk through Glastonbury without being mobbed. Joe could - but the people that recognised him never intruded on his privacy. He had the freedom to walk all over the campsite and just talk to people. I guess it meant he could talk, learn and listen - and that was what Glastonbury was for him. He genuinely loved Glastonbury and wanted everybody else to."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
