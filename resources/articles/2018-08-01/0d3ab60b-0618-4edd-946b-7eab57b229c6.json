World Vision, alongside more than 30 other organisations and advocacy groups, has called for parliament to bring the more than 120 children and their families to Australia or settled in a safe third country by Universal Children\u2019s Day on 20 November. It follows a unanimous motion passed by the Australian Medical Association\u2019s federal council on Saturday, calling for the government to \u201cact urgently to guarantee the health and wellbeing\u201d of the children and their families. The coalition includes World Vision New Zealand, the Australian Council for International Development, the Refugee Council of Australia, St Paul\u2019s Anglican Cathedral, the Anglican Diocese of Sydney, Australian Lawyers Alliance, and the Australian arms of Save the Children, Oxfam, Amnesty International and Plan International. \u201cWe are calling for common sense, for courage, for compassion and for leadership from our political leaders to resolve this situation,\u201d World Vision Australia\u2019s chief executive Claire Rogers said in Canberra on Monday. \u201cThis harmful, secretive, and dysfunctional system of detention must end.\u201d \u201cWe abhor any form of unfair vulnerability created by a situation and this is actually of the Australian parliament\u2019s making,\u201d Rogers told Guardian Australia. \u201cThere\u2019s a quite clear contravention of the refugee convention, and also we believe very strongly a breach of the rights of the child.\u201d The campaign highlights a number of children, including three-year-old Melanie*. \u201cIt is so difficult to live in Nauru,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI wish on nobody that they are stuck here like us.\u201d There is growing alarm at the mental health and wellbeing of children on Nauru. The Australian immigration minister, Peter Dutton, has repeatedly denied them access to healthcare in Australia, despite medical advice that it is a matter of life and death. Dutton has repeatedly been taken to court over these decisions, and lost, with at least 12 children so far brought to Australia for care under court order. Some have attempted suicide multiple times. Guardian Australia reported earlier this month on the case of a girl suffering a severe major depressive disorder and resignation syndrome, a medical condition observed mainly among refugee children in Sweden but now found in several children on Nauru. Children suffering the condition \u2013 a reaction to extreme trauma \u2013 withdraw from interaction, refusing food and water and communication. It is potentially fatal. Rogers said there was no \u201ceasy answer\u201d but the coalition wanted the situation resolved to ensure they \u201chave an opportunity to grow up with hope\u201d. \u201cThese children are caught between a desire to stop deaths at sea, which we absolutely don\u2019t want to see an increase in, but there\u2019s no justification for locking children up to create that outcome, that\u2019s not the solution,\u201d said Rogers. Chief executive of Oxfam Australia, Helen Szoke, said Australia had a strong economy and a proven history of managing resettlement effectively, and needed to increase the number of refugees it assisted. \u201cAs humanitarian organisations we are seeing first hand that across the world an unprecedented number of people have been forced to flee their homes,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the end of 2017, 68.5 million people were displaced, by wars and crises, like those in Syria, Yemen and countries I\u2019ve visited like South Sudan.\u201d There are also around 40 children born in detention during the past five years who have never known another life. Many have witnessed or been subjected to abuse or harm, including but not limited to the hundreds of incidents documented in the Nauru Files, published by Guardian Australia in 2016. Rogers has been at the helm of World Vision Australia for around 18 months, and said one of the challenges was realising she would be advocating for children in her own country, not just those in the developing world. \u201cAs the largest humanitarian organisation in the world focused on child wellbeing and in particular, vulnerable children, we felt it was most appropriate for us to recognise we have vulnerable people on our own shores,\u201d Rogers said. Dutton has maintained the children on Nauru are not in detention because those who have not moved from the centre into community accommodation are free to come and go, and that the Coalition government has technically closed both offshore detention centres, as well as 17 onshore. \u201cWe know from many psychological studies over many years, at least 100 years, that human response to stress and lack of autonomy is quite profound psychologically,\u201d Rogers said in response. \u201cThis is not a normal environment for children, particularly these children. While the Nauruans also live on the island, they\u2019re free to come and go as they wish, and they\u2019re living with their families and their extended families, which is a very different situation to these children.\u201d The Australian Medical Association president, Dr Tony Bartone, said the children and families held indefinitely on Nauru must be given urgent access to appropriate healthcare, transparently. Bartone said while International Health and Medical Services staff were \u201cdoing their best in trying conditions\u201d, the Australian public needed to be informed. \u201cThe AMA repeats its call for a delegation of independent Australian health professions to be allowed to visit and examine the asylum seekers \u2013 adults and children \u2013 and report their condition to the Australian parliament and the Australian people,\u201d said Bartone. \u201cIt is our responsibility to care for these people. It is all about human rights. It is the right thing to do.\u201d On Monday morning, Labor\u2019s spokesman for immigration, Shayne Neumann, said the Australian government should take up New Zealand\u2019s offer of resettling some refugees, given it had managed to do it with the US."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
