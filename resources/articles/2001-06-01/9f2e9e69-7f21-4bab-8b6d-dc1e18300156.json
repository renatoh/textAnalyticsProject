According to research carried out by ICM Research on behalf of financial technology provider, Fiserv, one in five voters in the general election will base their decision on personal finance and tax policies. The poll, which surveyed more than 1,000 people, found that those aged between 25 and 34 were most concerned about personal finance and tax issues, with almost a third citing this as the biggest influence on their decision. Twice as many men will base their vote on financial criteria than women, according to the survey. Women, on the other hand, are 34% more likely to choose between the parties on health and education issues than men. And while personal finance is of more importance to certain social classes, regional differences don't seem to exist. One in five voters in the north, south and Midlands all agreed this was the most influential issue in determining their voting decision. The survey found pensioners are among the least likely to take party political stances on these issues into account. This will not be welcome news for the Conservatives and the Lib Dems, who have concentrated much of their campaigning on what they say is Labour's disregard of pensioners' needs during its time in power. \"Personal finance is a key influencer for marginal voters. The Tories have been quick to recognise this with an election pledge to cut tax by \u00a38bn over three years. Labour's adverts have also picked up on this issue,\" said Phil Alcock, senior vice-president, international market development at Fiserv. \"UK consumers are much more financially savvy than they were at the last election. If the take-up of new services such as internet banking, online share trading, and investment in Isas are any gauge, then finance policy will be a key election battleground. This could be good news for voters' pockets,\" he added. All three parties have spent a considerable part of the campaign highlighting their stance on tax and pension policies as well as long-term care and savings. Analysts have been divided as to which party voters will be better off under in terms of personal finance issues.
