Gibson is the leader of the rightwing activist group Patriot Prayer and the suit is one of a proliferating set of legal efforts associated with Gibson\u2019s activities in Oregon and Washington throughout the Trump era. The violent incident, which was captured on several videos made by Gibson associates, took place during a rally staged by Patriot Prayer in support of Professor Bret Weinstein, who was at the center of national controversy over his opposition to a day of absence for white staff and students at the college. The suit has been brought by Washington state civil rights lawyer Larry Hildes on behalf of his client, Joseph Robinson. It alleges WSP officers collaborated with Patriot Prayer members in the illegal arrest and detention of Robinson at the College. In a phone conversation, Hildes said that the aim of the suit was to \u201cget the state patrol reined in\u201d and to encourage policy changes. In relation to Patriot Prayer, Hildes said: \u201cI want to shut them down.\u201d \u201cI want them out of business,\u201d Hildes said of the far-right protest group. \u201cI want them out of existence as an entity.\u201d Patriot Prayer\u2019s incursion on to the campus on a rainy afternoon was counter-protested by anti-fascist activists, students and staff. Over a number of hours, Patriot Prayer and anti-fascists exchanged blows and pepper spray. Gibson and others were covered in silly string by antifascists, and Gibson at one point sustained a facial wound. A large number of WSP riot police struggled to contain the melee. The suit focuses on one incident in which it alleges WSP and rightwing demonstrators collaborated in violating Robinson\u2019s civil rights when he was allegedly grabbed by Patriot Prayers members at the direction of Gibson, and then handed to the police, who arrested him \u201cwithout asking any questions\u201d. \ufeffVideo of the incident shot by Gibson-aligned videographer Robert Zerfing shows Robinson being dragged by the neck with a bandana he had been wearing as a mask. After Robinson was arrested, he was jailed and charged with disorderly conduct. A criminal case was pursued against him for 11 months before being dropped by the Thurston county prosecutor. Hildes\u2019s complaint alleges that WSP\u2019s posture effectively \u201cauthorized Patriot Prayer\u201d to make arrests. \ufeffThe suit is one of many arising from Gibson\u2019s street protests, and his conflicts with leftists in Washington and Oregon. Contacted by phone, Gibson said he had not previously heard about the suit. Asked generally about the range of legal actions and prosecutions against him, Gibson said: \u201cThey\u2019re just trying to silence me. We\u2019ve just got to push through.\u201d \ufeffA WSP spokesman said via email that \u201cit would be unfair to all concerned to comment on until resolved in court\u201d. Gibson and other associates are also defendants in a suit brought by Cider Riot, a Portland cidery popular with the city\u2019s radical left that was the center of a violent brawl in May this year, after Gibson and his associates made their way there, some armed with bricks, batons and chemical weapons. The cidery\u2019s owner, Abram Goldman-Armstrong, is seeking $1m from Gibson and his co-defendants."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
