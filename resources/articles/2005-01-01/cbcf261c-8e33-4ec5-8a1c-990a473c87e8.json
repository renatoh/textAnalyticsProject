The Brazil midfielder is out until at least April with a back injury and tests will determine whether he needs even longer to recover. Gilberto suffered a fractured vertebra in mid-September and Arsenal are waiting to find out whether the injury has healed. If it has, the Brazilian will still need 10-12 weeks to recuperate. If it has not, he will be ruled out for the remainder of the campaign. A worst-case scenario would then see him need surgery, though Ars\u00e8ne Wenger would be keen to avoid that. The Arsenal manager is hopeful that Gilberto will get the all-clear this week but knows the 28-year-old midfielder would not be back to his best until the final few weeks of the season. \"The news I had from the specialist he has seen was rather good,\" Wenger said. \"But we want to check that with our own specialist. We have to consider that the best of Gilberto could happen in mid-April if it is positive.\" Wenger's problems in midfield are exacerbated by the uncertain future of Edu, who is expected to join Valencia this month or in the summer. The manager is keen to strengthen in that area and Lyon's Mickael Essien is on his list of targets. The French champions would want about \u00a310m for the 22-year-old Ghanaian defensive midfielder. \"Essien is a player Arsenal have been following for quite some time - since before he was at Lyon,\" said the player's agent Fabien Piveteau. \"But he has already played in the Champions League this year, so he is not eligible to play for Arsenal. We don't think there is anything possible for the January window but we will await what happens in the summer.\" According to reports from Italy, Arsenal's chief scout Steve Rowley was monitoring the performance of Milan's reserve goalkeeper Christian Abbiati in the Italian Cup game against Palermo last night. The 27-year-old Abbiati has fallen out of favour at San Siro after the Brazilian Nelson Dida established himself as the first choice. As a consequence Abbiati has also lost his place as Gianluigi Buffon's cover in the Italian national team and has not been included in Marcello Lippi's squad since August 2004. The highly rated goalkeeper, who would also be eligible for the Champions League having not appeared in the competition with the rossoneri , would like to change environment in order to relaunch his career but Milan are not willing to let him go, at least until June, as they want two top-level goalkeepers. \"Abbiati is one of the goalkeepers in Arsenal's list but Milan will not sell him if they don't find a good replacement first,\" said Abbiati's agent Claudio Vigorelli. Southampton are interested in buying Jason Euell from Charlton but have been told that the 27-year-old will be made available only if Charlton can first line up a replacement. The Saints manager Harry Redknapp has also inquired about taking Nigel Quashie from his former club Portsmouth, though he would not be allowed to sign the midfielder cheaply and would need about \u00a32m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
