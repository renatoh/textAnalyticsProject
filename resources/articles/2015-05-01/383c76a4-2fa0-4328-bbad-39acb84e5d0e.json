Carmody claimed the public revelations of \u201cdisharmony between me and some judges \u2026 shine a light on serious cultural and structural problems within the judiciary\u201d. The chief justice, whose only move towards legal reform to date has been to set up a committee to examine televised court cases, has tied his offer to quit to obtaining a government commitment to a broader reform agenda. This includes the establishment of a judicial commission which would be instrumental in appointing and disciplining judges - and which senior legal figures said would ironically would have prevented Carmody\u2019s own appointment. Carmody claims in a statement that he was the target of a campaign to oust him by other judges who resisted \u201cchange and modernisation\u201d. \u201cThese problems had their origins and were festering long before I was appointed to bring in needed reforms,\u201d he said. \u201cThose resistant to change and modernisation have made it their primary goal to force me out, seemingly at all costs. \u201cI am willing to resign on just terms, not for them, not because of them, but to break the impasse we now find ourselves at. My giving up the role won\u2019t solve these problems. I offer it in the hope to refocus the conversation on the real issues.\u201d Carmody promised a detailed reform agenda upon his appointment but so far had only flagged the televising of court proceedings. He set up a committee to examine the change but then shortly after resigned, citing other commitments. This left the related research and publications to other judges including appeal court president Margaret McMurdo, who now refuses to sit on any case with Carmody after his ill-fated role in the Cowan murder appeal. Senior legal figures, including McMurdo, supported the call for a judicial commission, which prompted attorney general Yvette D\u2019Ath to reveal her department was investigating the option. Before January\u2019s election, Labor ruled out the creation of an independent commission, committing only to a new \u201cprotocol\u201d around judicial appointments. Carmody told the Australian it had become \u201cimpossible\u201d to do his job amid soured relations with other senior judges and that his departure would appear to be a \u201cnet gain to the people of Queensland\u201d. \u201cI have one senior judge who won\u2019t sit with me on any cases. I have another senior judge who secretly records a conversation with me. That makes governance and my ability to do my job impossible.\u201d His announcement comes after he took medical leave from court work for at least a month, citing the effect of medication for an ongoing back problem. It also comes a day before the expected release under right to information laws of his conversation with John Byrne, in which Carmody purportedly describes his colleagues as \u201cscum\u201d. Guardian Australia revealed that Carmody, days before taking leave, had a private dinner with Campbell Newman, the former premier who controversially handpicked the chief justice amid strong opposition from judges and senior legal figures. Carmody has faced ongoing scrutiny over his performance in cases, his work rate, and his dramatic falling out with his colleagues since he took the role in July 2014. The chief justice, who earns $461,000 a year, is three years away from qualifying for a judge\u2019s pension. Judges in Queensland can only be forced from office for serious misbehaviour or incapacity and after a parliamentary vote. Carmody said he would on Friday \u201cpresent a clear vision for change and a pathway to a transparent, trustworthy, accountable 21st century court system we can all be confident in\u201d. Carmody is scheduled to give an opening address at a legal conference at a luxury resort on Hamilton Island, one of the \u201ccivic and administrative\u201d engagements he had committed to while on medical leave from court duties. Carmody\u2019s announcement was welcomed by both sides of politics and senior legal figures. Queensland council for civil liberties president Michael Cope said while Carmody\u2019s decision was welcome \u201che should never have been appointed\u201d and the former Newman government was to blame. \u201cMr Carmody was disqualified from holding the office by his blatant political comments and conduct whilst chief magistrate,\u201d Cope said. He noted Carmody\u2019s comments around financial compensation \u2013 being three years away from a judicial pension \u2013 and said the government should be prepared to negotiate with Carmody around that as his ability to practice as a lawyer after resigning as chief justice would be limited. Prominent solicitor Bill Potts said it was ironic that under a judicial commission Carmody is calling for, he would never have been appointed. \u201cThe whole idea of a judicial commission is this: when you go for a role such as chief justice \u2026 it should be free of political favour, interference or patronage \u2026 [and] it ought to be merit based,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe simple reality is the Carmody experiment \u2026 has failed comprehensively. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a matter of squabble between the so called legal elite. It\u2019s also been about a person who unfortunately signally failed to inspire, lead and work at the same level as other judges, and that has been a great pity and a disappointment.\u201d Potts said it was \u201c(also) ironic that the chief justice, at the moment he is appearing to place the integrity of the courts ahead of his own interest, is putting a price on it\u201d. Retired judge and judicial ethics expert Jim Thomas said Carmody\u2019s resignation was \u201cthe best thing to happen to the courts in 10 months\u201d. It was the right thing to do \u201cbecause he is plainly in the wrong job\u201d, Thomas told ABC. He rejected the suggestion Carmody had been \u201cbullied\u201d by other judges who had \u201ckept the court running when a person wasn\u2019t showing any leadership and wasn\u2019t doing his share of the work\u201d. Thomas said Carmody emerged \u201cin a very poor light\u201d after his role on the appeal case of Daniel Morcombe\u2019s murderer Brett Cowan, where \u201cinstead of writing a judgment he was out meeting a lobby group\u201d. His conduct during the Cowan case, from which he recused himself before an application for bias could be heard, was \u201carguably \u2026 getting towards misconduct\u201d that could remove him from office. Attorney general Yvette D\u2019Ath said the move, which Carmody flagged with her last month, was a \u201csignificant gesture\u201d towards resolving issues publicly played out in the judiciary. D\u2019Ath said the saga had tainted \u201cthe public\u2019s view of the integrity of our courts\u201d. She refused to be drawn on the conduct of any of the judges including Carmody but said \u201cthe whole judiciary needs to think about the way they\u2019ve conducted themselves with the media\u201d. Despite Labor rejecting calls for a judicial commission before the election, D\u2019Ath said her department was now examining interstate models. She told the ABC that Carmody had not specified a date of resignation but was welcome to commence negotiating terms with her office. Shadow justice spokesman Ian Walker said it was a \u201cgracious and generous offer\u201d that gave an opportunity to resolve the situation. Walker told ABC he had discussed Carmody\u2019s appointment with former attorney general Jarrod Bleijie but refused to detail their exchange, except to say he was sure that Bleijie shared his endorsement of the chief justice\u2019s offer to provide a circuitbreaker to the impasse in the judiciary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
