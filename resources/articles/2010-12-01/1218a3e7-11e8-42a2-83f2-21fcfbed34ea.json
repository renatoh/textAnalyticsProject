And so it may seem to him: with an act like this, he's unlikely to attract intellectuals. Jefferies is a successful standup with a burgeoning career in the US. Perhaps they have more patience Stateside for macho comedy in which every other sentence starts, \"Sometimes, when I fuck a chick ...\" When he's not squiring \"chicks\", Jefferies is snorting coke or wanking. Judging by tonight's fare, there's little time left for anything so cissy as writing jokes. There's nothing wrong, of course, with off-colour comedy. But tonight, Jefferies isn't good enough to redeem the standard-issue Madeleine McCann gags and graphic misogyny. A Jerry Sadowitz or Doug Stanhope creates a persona to contextualise those jokes, or offsets the cynicism with linguistic or comic ability. Jefferies is a bland phrase-maker and a so-so joke-writer, who says of one \"fat\" admirer, \"She was the type of girl who might have a personality, but \u2013 who cares?\", then pauses for a laugh. Notwithstanding the odd half-assed effort to distance himself from these sentiments, Jefferies comes across as proud of his grim worldview. One looks in vain for subversion or surprise. Apparently we're meant to take at face value these tales of spit-roasted hookers and pornstar girlfriends scorned. Some may see Jefferies as fearlessly honest about the male psyche. Maybe so, but he's also highly selective about it. Curiosity and compassion, love and silliness have been edited out. Thankfully, a big proportion of the world isn't thick, and wants more from its comedy than priapic misanthropy. I'm one of them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
