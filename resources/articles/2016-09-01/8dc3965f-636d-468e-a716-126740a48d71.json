The Newspoll, published in the Australian on Thursday, showed Baird\u2019s approval rating had fallen from 61% to 39% and his dissatisfaction rate has more than doubled. Two party preferred support for his government dropped from 56% to 51% while Labor had a five points gain to 49%. Baird has suffered the biggest fall in his net satisfaction rating of any state premier in the history of Newspoll, going from positive 39 points in December to negative seven points. His satisfaction rating has fallen from 61% per cent in December to 39% and his disapproval rating is 46%. The premiers of Queensland, Victoria and South Australia are all now more popular than Baird in satisfaction ratings. The ban on greyhound racing is being blamed for the fall with 51% of those polled believing the government should have given the industry a chance to reform itself and 41% thinking the ban was fair. Baird has faced fierce criticism from the greyhound industry and sections of the National party for his decision to ban racing after a damning review into the industry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
