Charlie Brooker scooped the TV award for his role on Channel 4's satire show 10 O'Clock Live, as well as for his dystopian drama Black Mirror. Stewart Lee won best standup DVD for the second series of Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle. His former comic partner Richard Herring won the internet award for a prolific output on his website, including a surreal podcast based on imaginary snooker matches and a frequently updated blog. The shortlist was drawn up by a panel of critics, with users of Chortle, a comedy website, voting for the winners. Given that only two female comics had been nominated out of 54 possible slots, the chances of a woman winning were slim. In the end, however, rising star Susan Calman took the prize for best compere. The other female nominee, Dana Alexander, lost out to Alun Cochrane in the best club comic category. Dylan Moran won best tour, beating Jerry Seinfeld and Stephen Merchant. Tim Key took the award for best show for his critically acclaimed Masterslut, which combines poetry with comedy. Simon Munnery won the award for innovation for La Concepta, a pop-up restaurant for four diners with non-existent dishes, described as the \"fringiest fringe experience of 2011\" by Guardian critic Brian Logan when it was staged at the Edinburgh festival. Chortle's editor Steve Bennett said: \"We had an eclectic range of winners tonight, from old hands known for their grumpiness, to the smart comedy of Tim Key or the science-based radio show Infinite Monkey Cage, to those such as The Rubberbandits, Tony Law and newcomer Patrick Cahill who revel in the absurd. I think that's a good reflection of the great diversity on the British comedy scene, which is by far the most vibrant in the world.\" When a Guardian article pointed out the lack of women on the shortlist when it was announced last month, Bennett responded: \"Although I can't speak for all the panellists, I do know that the gender of any potential nominee never entered the discussion, and I don't think the lack of women on the final list crossed any of our minds. We were looking for the funniest people, simple as.\" He added that there were fewer women \"on every rung of the comedy ladder\". Calman, who is a regular panellist on Radio 4's News Quiz and is set to star with Jennifer Saunders in a new sitcom called Dead Boss, once organised a photoshoot of 80 female comedians at the Edinburgh festival to \"empirically prove\" that there were women doing standup. She recently told the Guardian: \"Some people do not like female comics ... the only thing I can do is work as hard as I can until people can no longer ignore me, turn up for everything I'm booked for and do it to the best of my ability.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
