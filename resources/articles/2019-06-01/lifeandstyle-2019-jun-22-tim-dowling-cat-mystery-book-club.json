The day before book club I receive an email from Uber, thanking me for my recent journey from King\u2019s Cross to Acton. I have not left the house in four days. I find the middle one at the front door, back from university with approximately a third of his worldly possessions. \u201cUber mentioned you might be here,\u201d I say. \u201cYeah, hi,\u201d he says. My wife comes down the stairs. \u201cDid you take a taxi?\u201d she says. \u201cI strongly disapprove of that.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why I use his account,\u201d the middle one says, pointing at me. \u201cDo you want to come over the road to see the kittens?\u201d she says. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t come back with one,\u201d I say. On the day of book club, I flip through the book \u2013 I finished it over a month ago and remember little about what happens. I am reminded that the main character is called Tim, and that he is also sort of a jerk: aloof, diffident, boring, emotionally unreachable. Yeah, we get it, I think. That afternoon my wife tells me that Kate from over the road isn\u2019t coming to book club. \u201cWhy not?\u201d I say. \u201cBecause of the cat,\u201d she says. She explains that the previous day Kate\u2019s cat got out through an open window and disappeared, leaving behind a litter of week-old kittens. \u201cHarsh,\u201d I say. \u201cBut then today it snuck back in and made off with one of the kittens,\u201d she says. \u201cKate\u2019s beside herself.\u201d \u201cI can see that\u2019s bad,\u201d I say. \u201cBut not missing-book-club bad.\u201d My wife goes over the road with the middle one. An hour later she returns without him. \u201cSo, the cat\u2019s now grabbed a second kitten,\u201d she says. \u201cNo one knows where she\u2019s taking them.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s awful,\u201d I say. \u201cOn the other hand\u2026\u201d \u201cOn the other hand, what?\u201d she says. \u201cKeep the window open, cat takes all the kittens away, the end,\u201d I say. \u201cProblem solved.\u201d It has been raining on and off all day. As we leave for book club, it is on again. Kate is keeping lookout on the corner while the middle one climbs over a garden wall. \u201cWe think they might be back there somewhere,\u201d Kate says. \u201cYou\u2019re both going to get arrested,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Kate says. At book club, my wife explains the reason for Kate\u2019s absence. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible,\u201d Nicky says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Problem solved\u2019,\u201d I say. No one speaks. Everyone else arrives, and we sit down. I usually have a lot to say at book club, but tonight I find myself preoccupied. It\u2019s raining harder than ever, and getting dark. Halfway through the evening, my wife\u2019s phone pings. She looks at the screen. \u201cOh!\u201d she says. \u201cWhat?\u201d I say. She shows me a long text message from Kate, recounting how the middle one, after crouching in the rain for hours, managed to track the cat to a secluded spot in a stranger\u2019s back garden, where, in the dark, he gathered up the missing kittens in his jacket. Cat and kittens were now reunited, and safely home. \u201cAw,\u201d says everyone. Not for the first time, I am reminded of the simple spirit of kindness that resides in every human heart except mine. After a few minutes looking at pictures of kittens on my wife\u2019s phone, we return to the book. \u201cSo,\u201d Emma says, \u201cdo we like Tim?\u201d \u201cNot really,\u201d Sash says. \u201cWere we supposed to?\u201d \u201cHe was sort of meant to be inadequate, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d Nicky says. \u201cEmotionally deficient,\u201d Emma says. \u201cOf course he was,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s called Tim.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t really like the book, to be honest,\u201d my wife says. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re all called Tim,\u201d I say. On the way home, my wife takes me to see the kittens. They are smaller, and frailer, than I could have possibly imagined."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
