A relative handful of supporters, chanting behind a blue-and-white banner outside Stamford Bridge and a few tears shed by Didier Drogba. Despite the expected outcry in the media and a murmur or two at Old Trafford on Sunday, this was about the sum of the anger, outrage and resentment expressed immediately after the parting of Chelsea and the finest manager they ever employed. The manager who guided them to back-to-back league titles and had masterminded the winning of six trophies, mostly endearing himself to the public despite an inclination to attract deserved criticism through a series of unpleasant incidents. A few chants and a trickle of tears? Call that a protest? I'll give you a protest and it is offered with no apology for once more mentioning the name of my dear friend Brian Clough who, you will remember, with his assistant, Peter Taylor, steered unfashionable Derby County to the championship in 1972 only to resign in high dudgeon 18 months later. By comparison the Chelsea protests look no more intimidating than grandma's final wave through the window as the 5.30 express pulls out of St Pancras. Allow me to take you back to those unforgettable days in the autumn of 1973 when, for days on end, the street outside Derby's ramshackle Baseball Ground was jammed with media and fans. The place was under siege while, inside, the players were seriously planning a sit-down strike - a blank refusal to take part in a home match against Leicester scheduled for the Saturday. I was among a handful of newspapermen privileged to report the revolution from inside the premises where the players stormed through the place yelling their dissatisfaction and demands that Clough be reinstated. The former England winger Alan Hinton appeared from the kitchen, holding aloft a tea urn and predicting: \"This, gentlemen, is the only bloody silverware we'll ever get our hands on from now on.\" Clough, who was behind much of the protest without exactly orchestrating it, eventually persuaded the players against the strike which, by now, had made the front pages. He, too, turned up on the Saturday but only to wave to the masses with their scores of banners pleading for \"Clough in, Longson out\" - a reference to the belligerent old chairman Sam Longson with whom Clough later offered to bury the hatchet, \"right in the back of Sam Longson's head\". The inevitable victory did not quell the mood of fans or players - or the town itself, through which thousands marched for the official protest movement which held countless meetings and recruited the enthusiastic support of the Labour MP Phillip Whitehead. Now that's what you call a protest. Even when Longson and friends let it be known that Dave Mackay was to be installed as Clough's successor the anarchy raged on. The lights, cameras, microphones, notebooks and fans converged on the ground and jammed the street again, tipped off that the players were against Mackay's appointment despite him being a former team-mate of several. They threatened a sit-in and their mood was such that the club secretary and a director locked themselves in the boardroom where, too afraid to sneak to the toilet, they peed into an ice-bucket - probably the one in which they had chilled the title-winning champagne the previous year. I read at the weekend where Mourinho had reportedly mentioned the attitude of the captain, John Terry, as a contributory factor in his departure. Hardly a parallel with the furore at Derby where Roy McFarland - like Terry, the club skipper and England's centre-half - telephoned Mackay and warned him not to take the job, saying: \"There's a lot of turmoil and we think we can get Cloughie and Taylor back. We don't want you here.\" Being Dave Mackay, of course, he took no notice. He stuck out that barrel chest, threatened to play the reserves instead and went on to shape Derby's next league title triumph two seasons later. All this, remember, was about a manager who had not been fired or ejected with that curious excuse of \"mutual agreement\" but who had voluntarily walked out on a newly signed four-year contract. As Clough later observed: \"Things blow over - even turmoil on such an unprecedented scale. Eventually players realise they have enough on their plate keeping fit, getting in the side and staying there and looking after the money they make from doing it.\" Times do change, though, and perhaps there is a reason why the Chelsea protests were so low-key. Perhaps the fans are fearful of driving away the billionaire who made all things possible. And perhaps there is less opportunity for complaint when players receive in excess of \u00a3100,000 a week and live in a mansions with Ferraris at the bottom of the garden."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
