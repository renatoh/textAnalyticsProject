With round-the-clock broadcasting, the image, featuring Hersee's seven-year-old daughter Carol and Bubbles the clown playing noughts and crosses, can now be seen only in the very early hours of the morning on BBC2. George was born in Sussex and educated at Chichester boys school. He specialised in electrical engineering at Southampton university and joined the BBC's engineering planning and installing department, which fitted the technical equipment, in 1949. He worked for the corporation on broadcast engineering for some 30 years. I first came into contact with him when we met as junior professional engineers in the early 1950s, when we were members of a large group of technicians in the department. Life was very hectic in those days. Television was in its infancy and broadcasts, lasting little more than four hours a day, were often live, and not yet available nationwide. Our task was to plan and provide, with considerable urgency, new studios to meet the requirements of this rapidly growing monster, television. Our initial work involved the re-equipment of 405 line black and white TV studios to operate on 625 lines, the provision of new 625 line black and white studios, and then the design and provision of new colour TV studios in London and all the regions of the BBC. The work in London was centred on studios at Lime Grove, Riverside, the TV Theatre and Television Centre. While George was initially involved in general project work to meet these requirements, he gradually became more specialised. The design of television cameras was in its infancy then, but developing rapidly. The need soon became apparent for a suitable test card to be placed in front of a camera, which would enable assessment of the technical performance of the colour TV chain - from broadcast camera to viewing receiver. A number of TV test cards had been in use by the BBC since pre-war days and some devised immediately post-war. George became the expert in, and made his name by, the provision, in collaboration with other BBC engineering departments and the industry, of BBC Test Card F. Although now adapted for wide-screen television, the design that is in use today is the same as originally conceived. In addition to the need to check all the precise engineering parameters of the system by the use of a test card, it was thought to be necessary in checking colour pictures to have the picture of a model as part of the card, to enable flesh tones to be subjectively assessed. While professional models were considered for this, George proposed that a child should be used and his seven-year-old daughter, Carol, was eventually photographed and her picture became part of BBC Test Card F. Little did he know what fame and recognition would follow, for both him and his daughter. The picture of Carol has spent more than 70,000 hours on the BBC airwaves and must have been seen, at sometime or another, by most of the population of the UK. The basic test card, as originally devised, has been used by all broadcasters in the UK and is also known worldwide, where it has been taken up by many other broadcasting organisations, albeit adapted, in so far as the picture content is concerned, to meet local population preferences. The girl and the clown were not playing noughts and crosses merely for effect. The technicians wanted a marker to indicate roughly the centre of the card for static convergence tests, and so the X appears in the centre of the screen. George retired from the BBC in 1979, and continued work in his field with a private engineering company. In retirement, he lived near Bournmouth, where he initiated a talking newspaper in his area. After leaving the BBC, he maintained contact with his former engineering colleagues and was prominent at BBC reunion gatherings on which he worked tirelessly until his death. He leaves a wife Audrey, who he met at the BBC, and his two daughters Carol and Gillian. \u00b7 George Hersee, television engineer, born December 29 1924; died April 11 2001"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
