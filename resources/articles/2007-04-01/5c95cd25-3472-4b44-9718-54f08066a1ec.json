Probably, despite all the chatter about high-profile foreign coaches, it was always meant to be, as part of the England and Wales Cricket Board's \"succession planning\". No one else, it seems, was approached, so one of the highest-profile jobs in the game went unadvertised with a straightforward promotion from the ranks. There was always an imperative for the ECB to produce its own man, rather than scour the globe, and not just to ape the Australian system that successively has seen Bob Simpson, Geoff Marsh, John Buchanan and now Tim Nielsen, himself as with Moores, promoted from the National Academy. Fletcher, in the eight years of his employment, with Rod Marsh of course, has helped to set up not just the academy itself but an elite programme to produce coaches of the highest possible credentials. It was from this background, for better or, more likely, worse, that Kevin Shine arrived as Troy Cooley's replacement, where a failure to do so would have reflected badly on the effectiveness of the programme. So it is with Moores. What, the critics would ask, is the point of having elite coaches of your own if, when the time comes, they are ignored for the sake of a profile? Moores' promotion has come rapidly, however. He has run the A team and been involved at the academy for two years but six months or so actually in charge is scarcely enough time to assess what sort of a job he is making of that, despite Morgan's ringing endorsement. It is also something Moores himself would recognise, for by repute he is meticulous by nature and reluctant to start a project without seeing it through. It would be in character for him to have sought reassurance that this was not a case of him being hustled into a job for which he might not be ready simply to satisfy the decision of his employers to make a clean break with Fletcher as soon as the World Cup was over. Against that, however, it will be recognised that Fletcher himself, the most successful and innovative coach England have had, came not from an international background, or even an academy, but from the domestic game in South Africa and South Wales. Moores' success with Sussex, once uncompetitive but transformed by his nous in administration and nurturing of talent, will stand him in good stead. To understand quite what Moores, in one of Fletcher's favourite phrases, will bring to the party, it is necessary to explain the function of head coach. Team manager or facilitator best describes the role. No man in charge of an international side has the qualification to deal with all the technical minutiae that cricket at that level demands. But the best men, as in any walk of life where expertise is called for, know where to go for help. Fletcher gathered round him a coterie of support, increasing with his influence on affairs and the availability of funding, so that batting, bowling, psychology, nutrition, fitness and technical analysis were all catered for. He brought in Matthew Maynard, whom he knew from his time at Glamorgan, and, after the disastrous loss of Cooley, Shine too. But these were his men. When John Carr, ECB director of cricket operations, was asked about the terms of the support staff contracts, he prevaricated. But unlike Fletcher, a permanent ECB employee, they are likely to be on temporary contracts and, as such, liable to have them terminated. It is unlikely Moores would have taken the job without ascertaining the status of those who initially will be working with him. It is equally unlikely that he would have agreed to keep all of them regardless. All the main support staff - Maynard as batting coach, Shine as bowling coach and the fitness trainer, Nigel Stockhill - will be vulnerable. Replacements could include the former Zimbabwe captain Andy Flower, whose batting seminars at the academy are highly regarded. Moores is his own man. He is following an impressive fellow but has seen how even the best can fall on hard times. Decisions must be made whether to make the inevitable changes gradually or cut losses. He might begin with the status of the captain, who has already been installed for the Test series against West Indies despite being no closer to showing form or batting fitness than he was at the start of the year. Michael Vaughan will try to form a bond but Moores might challenge that. There will be an imperative to focus more on one-day cricket, where England have been found wanting for so long, but not at the expense of Tests which remain a strength to be preserved. Things have been stagnant for too long."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
