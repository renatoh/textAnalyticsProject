That Lord's victory was only Hampshire's second win in the competition that has now become the Friends Provident, but the way they held their nerve suggests another promising day ahead, especially against a side with even less experience of the big occasion. However, a comfortable win by 40 runs with more than six overs to bowl looked a distant prospect as Hampshire made hard work of the first part of the task. Their innings was a pudding of an affair, the main ingredients being a slow wicket with a good spicing of suicidal tendencies, and once John Crawley had run himself out for 65 attempting a second to Heath Streak's arm - the first of two run-outs - it was a struggle for Nic Pothas and Dimitri Mascarenhas to ease them past 200. Kevin Pietersen, brought south by helicopter from the final Test at the England and Wales Cricket Board's expense, maintained a taste for aerial routes, living a dangerous life even before he mishit the gentle medium pace of Tim Groenewald - another Maritzburg College old boy - to mid-on for 18. Sean Ervine, the hero of the 2005 final, made only 12 before he was undone by a clever slide and throw from Groenewald. That was one of the closer judgments made by the busy video umpire, Rob Bailey, who probably found it even more taxing when three appeals came off one ball faced by Mascarenhas. Groenewald's shout for lbw was rejected by Peter Hartley, Neil Mallender at square leg turned down a stumping appeal from Tim Ambrose, and finally Warwickshire's captain, Darren Maddy, asked for the initial appeal to be referred, albeit in vain. By comparison the first 27 Warwickshire overs were calm as they held the asking rate to about 4.5 despite losing three wickets - two of them to catches by Crawley that tipped the man-of-the-match award firmly in his favour. His leap high to his left at gully, to get rid of Ian Westwood, seemed to surprise even a player in his 18th season. However, with the target nearing 100 Jim Troughton heaved Warne into the deep and the nerves began jangling as the wickets started falling. Kumar Sangakkara, a model of calm as he drove and pulled his way to 44, was dropped by Ervine off Warne but three balls and one run later he was gone. The Zimbabwean had barely finished apologising to his captain for the miss at slip when the Sri Lankan mispulled Ervine to square leg and was heading for the pavilion at the head of a Warwickshire rush. Alex Loudon went to the fifth ball of the same over and Streak misjudged a Warne top-spinner to be lbw for a single, and at 119 for seven the game was effectively over. Dale Steyn, playing his last game for Warwickshire, had a swing of the bat but Stuart Clark wrapped up the innings, bowling Steyn for 14 and then Ambrose, who managed to make a patient 41 when the mayhem was going on all around him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
