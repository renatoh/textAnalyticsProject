After 53 days Cheyenne has less than 2,400 miles to go to the finishing line off Ushant. The record stands at 64 days 8 hours and to beat that Fossett needs only to nurse a little more than seven knots from his craft. Cheyenne is regularly achieving 400-mile days, aver aging almost 17 knots, which if continued would see the giant catamaran slide across the finish in under 60 days some time next Tuesday. However, Cheyenne recently suffered damage to the forward beam that links the hulls and to which the leading forward support of the mast is anchored. Her rigging was also damaged on two occasions, but after the crew eased back to effect repairs they were able to push hard again. Currently Fossett and his crew are skirting the North Atlantic high-pressure zone in brisk easterly breezes which should soon swing into the south-west for the last two thousand miles. In Paris, Philippe de Villiers, the president of the Vend\u00e9e region, announced the format of the Vend\u00e9e Globe, the single-handed non-stop race around the world. The 2004-05 event will start from Les Sables d'Olonne on November 7. More than \u20ac4.5m (\u00a33m) will be spent organising this race."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
