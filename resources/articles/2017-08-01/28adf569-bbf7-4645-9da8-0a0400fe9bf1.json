The move signals the start of a much wider battle \u2013 to see who will be the king of online retail in America. Walmart, America\u2019s second largest bricks and mortar retailer, was slow to develop its online retail offer in the face of Amazon\u2019s growing dominance over the last 10 years. However, more recently it has been trying to play catch-up with significant investment in its digital operation. This culminated in Walmart\u2019s purchase of online retailer Jet.com for $3bn. This set the battle for the country\u2019s biggest online retail war, and it was only a matter of time before Amazon responded. That happened two months ago when they bought Whole Foods. Today\u2019s announcement is a sign that the battle has taken off in earnest. Items that will see the first price cuts on Monday include Whole Trade bananas, organic avocados, organic large brown eggs, kale and other organic food. The online retailing behemoth said it hopes to give Amazon Prime members special savings and other in-store benefits, including lockers where they pick up and drop off items. The company also said the 450 new physical locations it acquired in the deal for Whole Foods should help it speed up its grocery delivery capability. \u201cThis is just the beginning \u2013 we will make Amazon Prime the customer rewards program at Whole Foods Market and continuously lower prices as we invent together,\u201d said Jeff Wilke, CEO of Amazon Worldwide Consumer. \u201cThere is significant work and opportunity ahead, and we\u2019re thrilled to get started.\u201d Though Walmart lags way behind Amazon it has begin to make some progress \u2013 it now sells 67m items a month, up from 10m early last year. Amazon, however, sells hundreds of millions of items. Amazon\u2019s move on price is a direct attempt to attract Walmart customers who will have been put off by Whole Foods\u2019 high prices. At stake is an enormous online retail market which Amazon not only want to protect, but grow. The move also comes a day after Walmart announced a partnership with Google where the search giant will start offering Walmart products to people who shop on Google Express, the company\u2019s online shopping mall. As the New York Times reported: \u201cIt\u2019s the first time the world\u2019s biggest retailer has made its products available online in the United States outside of its own website.\u201d Amazon\u2019s announcement also comes just one day after Walmart announced it will expand its grocery delivery service with ride-hailing service Uber. The moves are clearly designed to help begin to remake Whole Foods\u2019 image for being overly expensive \u2013 \u201cWhole Paycheck\u201d as it is derisively known \u2013 and to position it ahead of an anticipated war with chains like Walmart, the largest US grocer, also looking to expand their reach in the food sector. The company said Whole Foods Market will continue to operate under its 365 brand name and pledged to \u201cpreserve its high standards and commitment to providing the finest natural and organic foods\u201d. Also on Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission said it won\u2019t investigate or try to stop Amazon\u2019s $13.7bn takeover of the food retailer. \u201cWe have decided not to pursue this matter further,\u201d the FTC said in a statement. Whole Foods co-founder John Mackey, who is staying on as CEO, said the company\u2019s core mission \u2013 \u201cto bring the highest quality food to our customers\u201d \u2013 remained intact. He anticipated the Amazon-Whole Food hook-up would enable the company to \u201clower prices and double down on that mission and reach more people with Whole Foods Market\u2019s high-quality, natural and organic food\u201d. Mackey added: \u201cAs part of our commitment to quality, we\u2019ll continue to expand our efforts to support and promote local products and suppliers. We can\u2019t wait to start showing customers what\u2019s possible when Whole Foods Market and Amazon innovate together.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
