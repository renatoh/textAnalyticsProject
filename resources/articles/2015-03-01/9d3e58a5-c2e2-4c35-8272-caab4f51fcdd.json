In emotional testimony that brought tears to the eyes of several jurors in the ongoing trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev \u2013 the survivor of two brothers accused of perpetrating the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing \u2013 Richard described the day he and his family shared, before the blast that left him half-deaf, his wife half-blind, his daughter maimed and his youngest son dead. \u201cIt was just something we did as part of living in the city,\u201d he said. \u201cWe loved living in the city; loved participating.\u201d His children \u2013 two sons, Henry and Martin, and daughter Jane \u2013 took part in the youth relay on Saturday, and they all caught the red line train on Monday to watch the kids\u2019 coach run in the main race. They were running late, Richard told the court. Hustling to leave the house, grabbing snacks and duffel bags. By the time they got to Hereford street, they had just missed seeing the lead runners go by. \u201cWe were unlucky that day,\u201d he told the court, and smiled sadly. They walked up toward Boylston Street, and stopped in Ben and Jerry\u2019s for ice cream. \u201cI can even remember everything we ordered,\u201d Richard said, his voice flat, his eyes far away. \u201cIt was a beautiful day.\u201d The court was shown a picture, in which Tsarnaev was visible, wearing a white cap, peak-backward, behind where Richard and his family were standing. \u201cHave you ever seen this person before?\u201d asked Nadine Pellegrini, the assistant US attorney, for the prosecution. \u201cUntil today? In person? No,\u201d answered Richard. When the first bomb went off, Richard said, he thought it was a sewer explosion. He tried to get his family over the barriers into the street. That\u2019s the last thing he remembered. The second bomb went off just beside him with what he described as an \u201cear-piercing\u201d noise, blowing him into the street, severing Jane\u2019s leg and killing Martin. The last time Richard saw Martin, he said, he knew from the colour of his skin that he was going to die. At the hospital with Jane, he said it was \u201clike a scene from the movies\u201d. \u201cYou know it\u2019s not good when you can see the look of horror on doctors\u2019 faces,\u201d he said. Later, he said, when he saw his wife again in hospital, she told him Martin was dead. \u201cI said, I know,\u201d he testified. The bomb blast also damaged Richard\u2019s hearing, giving him tinnitus and partial deafness. But, he said: \u201cI can still hear you. I can still hear music. I can still hear the beautiful voices of my family.\u201d Tsarnaev sat impassively throughout the testimony, his lawyer Judy Clarke \u2013 who has declined to cross-examine any of the prosecution\u2019s 19 witnesses so far \u2013 by his side. After testimony finished for the day he stood for the jury\u2019s exit, his hands clasped, staring down at the desk in front of him. It was a day in which the prosecution strove to bring the full horror of the attack home to the jury. Jeff Bauman, who lost both legs in the attack, testified in the morning that he thought he was going to die, and said he could see his \u201cbones and flesh sticking out\u201d. Bauman also testified that he saw Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the elder of the two accused of perpetrating the bombings, who was killed after a days-long manhunt, before the blast. The court was also shown previously unseen footage from the security camera in the Forum restaurant, outside which the second bomb \u2013 the one which killed Martin Richard \u2013 detonated. The video, which included the moment of detonation, showed the full harrowing extent of the carnage. It caused an gasp of horror in the courtroom. But it was the quiet pathos of Richard\u2019s testimony of the moment he saw his youngest son alive for the last time that provided the most emotional moment of the day. Pellegrino asked the final question: \u201cHow old was Martin when he died?\u201d \u201cHe was eight years old,\u201d Richard replied. The trial continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
