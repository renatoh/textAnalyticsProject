This resolve went in a flash last Tuesday when I saw Brockle Crag in bright sunshine following a month of overcast days. Brockle Crag is a dome of grass with a dazzlingly white quartzite streak tumbling down its chest, grey with rocks and appearing as a crag face from the distant track to Dash Falls behind Skiddaw. In a trice, both the Dash - and my bionic hips - were forgotten, and I made a beeline for this sash of white gold exerting such a siren's call from across the fields. At a seemingly gentle angle, surely there was no risk? I was to be rudely corrected in such misplaced optimism. Within moments of reaching up the first quartz step, as white as Kendal mint cake, I was repulsed to land on the ground with a thud. Careful! It is better to draw a veil over the resulting ascent, half on steep grass - lethal for trainers - and on the quartz with its small, incut holds speckled with lichen. Forty feet up, I became cragfast, unable to go up or down. Providence prevailed. A desperate reach to a grass tuft let me step up, heart-in-mouth, and reach a marble-like \"jug-handle\". The scramble up blocks to the final tower was something of a relief, before turning the ivory buttress to its right via bleached-white slabs to the top of the dome. Safe at last. Ahead was the wild, open expanse of Great Cockup, which in my instance could have been so aptly-named; behind lay the shining waters of Bassenthwaite Lake in one direction, and silvery skein of Dash Falls in the other."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
