It is a wild garden, for among all the flowers and shrubs there are \"weeds\": white dead-nettle, stinging nettle, dandelions, wood woundwort, sweet rocket, cow parsley, cranesbill, brambles, thistles, daisies and buttercups. So lots of food plants and nectar plants bring in lots of insects, which in turn attract lots of birds. Today I am searching for shieldbugs, and there they are sunning themselves on the wood woundwort. There are five singletons and two couples of woundwort shieldbug, which are quite small and rather drab \u2013 though the sun makes the dark spot on their back shine ruby-like \u2013 with a ruff of lace around their shoulders. Turning over the leaves I discover five nests of tiny white eggs. There is also a small nymph, which is black and cream, and an adult pied shieldbug, which is black and white: it is as if it is watching over its offspring \u2013 tiny orange-coloured nymphs that are in the flowers of the white dead-nettle. However, there is another name for these shieldbugs and that is stink bugs, because they emit quite a foul smell when disturbed, and that is what I can smell now. As I turn away from the smell, an insect whizzes past me and lands on the leaf of a laurel bush nearby. It is yet another shieldbug, this time a larger one, green with red markings, the more familiar hawthorn shieldbug. As its name suggests, it is commonly found on hawthorn, but it can be found on other trees or plants. Clouds have rolled on in, hiding the sun, and the insects slowly head for shelter under the leaves before the rain starts to fall and drenches them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
