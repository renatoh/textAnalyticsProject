The move will see Southgate link up once more with Ugo Ehiogu with whom he formed a successful central defensive partnership at Villa Park. \"A deal has now been agreed with Middlesbrough and all that remains now is for Gareth to agree terms and pass a medical,\" Villa's deputy chief executive Mark Ansell announced on the official club website. The former Crystal Palace defender asked for a move just before Euro 2000 and has been trying to leave the club ever since. However, there were no takers at Villa's \u00a310m asking price. Southgate said that he wanted to leave because he felt Villa were no longer one of the Premiership's elite and showed no sign of recovering that status. How this ambition squares with a move to Middlesbrough, who finished six places below Villa in the Premiership last season, is not immediately clear. But Boro have an apparently unlimited budget and an ambitious new manager in Steve McLaren and they will at least offer Southgate a refuge after a difficult year. Since he made his transfer request, he has had fans turn against him, received hate mail and had his car vandalised."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
