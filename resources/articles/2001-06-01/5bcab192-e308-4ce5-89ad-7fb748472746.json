Retail sales figures, published this morning by the Office of National Statistics (ONS), show the highest level in annual growth since 1997. The volume of retail sales was 6.4% up year-on-year, while month-on-month sales rose 0.8% - the highest since September 2000. The figures were above City expectations: analysts had predicted a 5.6% rise year-on-year and a 0.4% rise month-on-month. The ONS said there was strong growth in all sectors in May, but particularly in food sales. This had been boosted by the good weather, as people stocked up on food and drink to make the most of the hot bank holidays. The sales figures provoke fresh concern that consumer demand could push up prices, thereby raising inflation above the Bank of England's target 2.5%. This, coupled with a raft of data from the last two days, means the likelihood of a rate cut by the Bank in July is looking increasingly unlikely. Yesterday's data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) showed that average earnings growth rose to 5.2% in the three months to April from 5.1% in three months to March. This rise was well above the Bank of England's desired 4.5%. Figures on Tuesday also showed that inflation is up higher than expected at 2.4% - only just under the 2.5% Bank of England target."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
