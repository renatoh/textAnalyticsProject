The 30-year-old, who looked lean and mean in advance of next month\u2019s controversial WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight title rematch with Ruiz in Saudi Arabia, also denied claims made by the former champion David Haye that his sparring before the first fight with the Mexican-American had been too soft. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything differently mentally,\u201d said Joshua. \u201cI am a champion. I walked into a boxing gym and three years later I was Olympic champion. I have had one loss but I am not about to become a pussy overnight and not be able to fight.\u201d As for Haye\u2019s comments, Joshua was almost as forthright. \u201cMy sparring has always been technical and he has never been in my camp,\u201d he replied. \u201cI only needed 16 fights to become champion of the world, I have always been a fighter. I have not been protected, Rob has not had me sparring anyone with one arm behind their back.\u201d Joshua also laughed off criticisms from Tyson Fury, who said his rival did not look like he wanted to be in the ring against Ruiz before he was stopped on his feet in the sixth round. \u201cOf course I wanted to be there,\u201d said Joshua. \u201cTyson is at a different stage in his career, he would never understand what I\u2019m going through. I was ready, I was in a good place.\u201d However, Joshua conceded he would be much better prepared this time having originally expected to meet Jarrell Miller in June before the American failed a drug test and Ruiz stepped in. Joshua confirmed he had brought in a number of top-quality sparring partners to test him \u2013 including the former world title contenders Dereck Chisora and Bryant Jennings \u2013 as well as the cruiserweight Andrew Tabiti to try to replicate Ruiz\u2019s style. \u201cI am doing more shadow boxing in the mirror than I did before. And just more boxing, I did a lot of boxing in my break,\u201d added Joshua, who refused to say whether he planned to enter the ring considerably lighter than in the first fight to neutralise Ruiz\u2019s speed. \u201cI am not really focused on my weight, I am just focused on my sparring. Everyone in the team has different opinions on my weight but I like going off of my sparring. \u201cI could weigh anything but it just comes down to how I perform in the ring. I am not interested in getting down or up to 110kg and then thinking I am fit. If I am sparring 10 or 15 rounds at 120kg then I am good. The sparring gives me all the information I need.\u201d His trainer, Rob McCracken, said that Joshua had enjoyed \u201creal good sparring\u201d with partners who had pushed him hard. He added: \u201cSince Josh has been a professional, sparring partners have always come here to try to rip his head off and make a name for themselves. This group of sparring partners has done really well and pushed him every step of the way and we still have three very important spars ahead, where our fight strategy is going to be carried out.\u201d Amnesty International is among those to have warned that the Saudi authorities are attempting to \u201csportswash\u201d their human rights record by bringing the fight, billed as the \u201cClash of the Dunes\u201d\u201a to Diriyah on 7 December. However, Joshua and his promoter Eddie Hearn claim they are trying to increase boxing\u2019s global profile."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
