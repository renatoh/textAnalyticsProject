Analysts, and some of the retailers themselves, say they are still as profitable as before Amazon\u2019s \u201cunderwhelming\u201d launch \u2013 for now. On the stock market, where investors tend to have one eye firmly on the future, it\u2019s a different story. On Monday, high-performing local retailer JB Hi-Fi released a half-yearly update: growing profits, a steady market share, a drop in profit margins and disappointing results in New Zealand. As a result, its stock dropped 7.5% in the first three hours of trading \u2013 the company\u2019s biggest volume of stock traded since 2016. The day illustrated the fears investors have about the Amazon effect, despite the resilience of local retailers\u2019 sales figures. Kim Do, a senior industry analyst at Ibisworld, said the global giant had not yet actually affected retailers, with an undeveloped supply chain holding prices high enough to keep customers away. Amazon launched just three months ago and has only one fulfilment facility, or warehouse, in Dandenong in Victoria. \u201cAmazon is not directly affecting retailers as yet,\u201d Do said. \u201cWe believe that it can hurt share prices more than earnings performance.\u201d She said the threat of Amazon\u2019s growth in the future was spooking investors and dampening stock prices, while not affecting sales. On Monday, JB Hi-Fi announced its net profit grew 21% over the six months between July and December last year, with online sales surging 40%. But its chief executive, Richard Murray, said the company was consciously discounting its products in order to stay competitive with Amazon. As profits rose in total, the profit margins dropped 20 basis points, which Murray said was a result of selling more low-profit items such as computers and phones and less high-margin DVDs, CDs and software. \u201cThere is a lot happening in our market, so we just want to make sure we\u2019ve got the firepower to remain competitive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of Amazon and others and what they\u2019re doing in the market and we want to put our best foot forward.\u201d Do said this had caused the slide despite JB\u2019s good performance. \u201cThey\u2019ve been employing a discounting strategy to continue growing at the pace they\u2019re at. This may concern some investors who might believe this is not a sustainable way to grow.\u201d JB Hi-Fi\u2019s stock dropped to a low of $25.86 on Monday, before recovering slightly. However, the stock had risen 16% since Christmas after strong holiday sales. In the hardware sector, the Australian reported on Monday that suppliers currently tied to Bunnings Warehouse were asking the company if they could also begin supplying Amazon. The chief executive of Bunnings, Michael Schneider, told the paper he \u201cwelcomed\u201d the \u201chighly competitive environment\u201d. \u201cWe view our supplier relationships as a partnership \u2026 we appreciate and understand they have their own business plans and respect any decisions they make as part of this.\u201d Do said the future impact of Amazon was difficult to predict, due to how little time it had spent in Australia, and hinged on its ability to set up supply chains. \u201cThe biggest challenge will be adapting to the Australian market in terms of distribution,\u201d she said. \u201cOur population is very dispersed, unlike the home market in the US, where distribution costs are much lower. \u201cIt\u2019s really uncertain at the moment. We are expecting them to open a lot more fulfilment centres by mid to late this year.\u201d Amazon told Guardian Australia it could not provide any figures for the company\u2019s current market share, sales or profits in Australia, or plans for the future."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
