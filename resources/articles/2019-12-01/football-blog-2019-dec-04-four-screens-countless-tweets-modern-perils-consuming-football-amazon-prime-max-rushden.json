Primed for prime on a Tuesday night \u2013 waiting like all other broadcasters who hadn\u2019t been asked to take part to see if it fell apart. A centre-forward relies on the service from the wide men. Here Gabby Logan and friends depended on the service of your broadband. And I had no complaints. It ran smoothly and the football happened. Like it always does. The football, of course, wasn\u2019t the important bit. What mattered was how well social media performed over the course of the evening. I\u2019d already lined up a zinger of a tweet. \u201cVery much hoping, as Chris Wood scores a last-minute winner, the Amazon Prime commentator says: \u2018Add that to your basket and check out.\u2019\u201d One hundred retweets and 1,000 likes. It didn\u2019t land like Andy Ruiz Jr on Anthony Joshua. But it wasn\u2019t a bad start. It would get worse. Just the three retweets for \u201cI\u2019m afraid Sakhos are no longer in stock. #crybou #amazon\u201d after he careered into Adam Smith. It would get worse. It turns out Amazon\u2019s major selling point \u2013 that you can watch all the games \u2013 is the worst thing about it. You CAN watch all the games. You CAN watch Crystal Palace v Bournemouth. Any other year, we would have been blissfully unaware of such an offering. Two minutes at the end of Match of the Day when you\u2019ve stopped concentrating. A three paragraph report in a paper to be skimmed over. But I watched every minute of that half. Or more accurately, every minute of that half was broadcast into my living room. As soon as my concentration lapses in any game \u2013 a break in play, or even just a throw-in \u2013 I turn to the second screen. Here was my tactical setup. Mamadou Sakho\u2019s red card happens on Mrs Rushden\u2019s laptop which is placed on my lap. She hadn\u2019t used her free Amazon Prime trial. I have Twitter open on my laptop on the sofa to my left. In between my failed attempts to tweet amusing things about the football, I\u2019m engaged in the first ever polite conversation about antisemitism with a man called Ben, who\u2019s reacting to something I sent about tactical voting five hours earlier. At the same time, Jack has tweeted to point out the comedian and Guardian Football Weekly contributor Elis James is doing the voiceover for a BBC Four documentary about a farmyard. I turn the telly off mute and listen to his soothing voice. Elis informs me about roosters while the Aberystwyth brass band serenade a herd of cattle. I get my phone to WhatsApp Elis his narration back to him. And this is how I consume football. Four screens. Three conversations. Two with people I have never met, while a Welshman is telling me about bumble bees in the background as I\u2019m telling that same Welshman he\u2019s telling me about bumble bees. Perhaps if Palace v Bournemouth had been more interesting, I\u2019d have confined myself to just one other screen. And perhaps I\u2019m the only idiot incapable of concentrating on one thing at a time. But I doubt either is true. And this isn\u2019t confined to the armchair. Every other fan in the ground is on their phone \u2013 either checking a refereeing decision or filming another free-kick from behind the goal. This could be the one that goes in and we can get a point-of-view shot of an iPhone being smashed on the floor. Ten minutes into the Burnley v Manchester City game and people are complaining about buffering. How can we possibly be expected to watch a game a minute after it is really happening? Are we not owed real-time footage from Turf Moor piped into our living rooms? If we are 60 seconds behind, what\u2019s the point? We put a man on the moon FFS. I bet Neil Armstrong wasn\u2019t on delay. Buffering gives me yet another opportunity to tweet. I make up that Manchester City have taken the lead in the 22nd minute. \u201cCity 1-0. Great finish from Sterling.\u201d In come the replies. \u201cYou can\u2019t report this quick when we\u2019re streaming.\u201d The more perceptive: \u201cAre you lying?\u201d Then in the 24th minute, before I\u2019ve finished explaining I was kidding, Gabriel Jesus scores with a great finish. So instead of gently winding up a few people concerned by a small delay in the broadcast, now I look like a massive racist, as is pointed out to me by just a couple of people. I\u2019m lucky it doesn\u2019t blow up. Perhaps it\u2019s fate\u2019s way of telling me to just watch the game. And so Amazon\u2019s problem isn\u2019t Amazon\u2019s problem at all. It\u2019s our problem. During rare moments of reflection, I close my laptop and hurl it to the other end of the sofa \u2013 out of reach. Within seconds I sneak my phone out of my pocket. I forget who came up with the phrase \u2013 when you get bored of the big internet so you check the smaller internet to see what\u2019s up. It\u2019s almost as if the world will stop if we don\u2019t comment on everything. After Unai Emery was sacked, I found myself arranging my condiments on the kitchen table, cutting a speech bubble out of the back of an envelope, finding some Sellotape and sticking it to the salad cream with the phrase \u201cArsenal talking to Allegri\u201d, just so I could tweet: \u201cThis is what my sauces are saying about the next Arsenal boss.\u201d The worst part of that is I was quite pleased with it. I am a 40-year-old man. I have interests. All that for 32 retweets. In the last decade I have sent more than 63,500 tweets. I could have written a book. I am taking steps. I leave my phone downstairs at night \u2013 but there are times when I just stare at it thinking of something to say. When I sat in the Junior U\u2019s enclosure at Cambridge United in the 90s, the half-time entertainment was the Tannoy man giving us the latest scores from around the country. It was genuinely thrilling. When a game was on the TV, I watched it. I concentrated. I fell in love with that. I want to go back to that \u2013 but I\u2019m not sure I can."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
