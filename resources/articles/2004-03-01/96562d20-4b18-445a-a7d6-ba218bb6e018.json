Dill Faulkes said spending a few million pounds making science and maths in schools more interesting would have much more effect on children than spending money on truancy measures. With the Astronomer Royal, Sir Martin Rees, he today launched the Faulkes telescope project involving two robotic telescopes located in prime astronomical observing areas close to the world's most powerful professional telescopes. Because the telescopes are located in different time zones schoolchildren in the UK will be able to use them in daytime classroom hours. The telescopes are robotic and will be controlled over the internet. A webcam will show how the telescope is being controlled to focus on a selected object and the resulting images will be returned to schools in a matter of minutes. Schools simply book their timeslot; plan the work they want to carry out and take control of the telescope. Mr Faulkes, who attributes his own success in the software businesses to the state education he received in maths and science, became concerned about the decline in interest among schoolchildren in these subjects. \"The idea of giving British youngsters access to a world-class telescope immediately appealed to me. I could see that spending a few million pounds making science and maths in schools more interesting would have much more effect on children than spending half a billion on truancy measures,\" he said. The telescopes were built in Birkenhead by Telescope Technologies Ltd, a spin off company from Liverpool John Moores University. The Faulkes telescope project has received additional funding of approximately \u00a3750,000 from the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council and funds from the Department for Education and Skills. It is part of the National Schools Observatory's programme of making professional telescopes available to schools."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
