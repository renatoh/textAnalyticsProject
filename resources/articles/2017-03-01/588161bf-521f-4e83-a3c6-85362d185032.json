He handed his electronic diary to Mark Dreyfus, the shadow attorney general, late on Friday. It took three years for him to release his diary after Dreyfus made his original freedom of information request. The move came a week after Dreyfus threatened Brandis that he would push for contempt of court proceedings if Brandis did not release the diary immediately. \u201cThree years since the original freedom of information (FoI) request was made, and thousands of taxpayer dollars later \u2013 George Brandis has finally handed over his diary,\u201d Dreyfus said on Monday. \u201cWhile the capitulation represents a victory for common sense, transparency and the principles of FoI, it is also ridiculous that it took such lengths to force the attorney general to comply with an act that sits within his own portfolio. \u201cIn order for the attorney general to fulfil a simple request, it has taken an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, a hearing in the full court of the federal court, and the threat of contempt. \u201cIt is absurd, and it shows once more Senator Brandis\u2019s unsuitability for the role of attorney general and his contempt for the rule of law. Labor has been seeking Brandis\u2019s diary since February 2014 to discover what consultation he held before cuts to his portfolio in the 2014 budget. Dreyfus lodged an FoI request to inspect Brandis\u2019 electronic diary from September 2013 to May 2014. The Labor frontbencher has had a string of legal wins, with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal rejecting Brandis\u2019s refusal of the request in December 2015 and finding it had to be processed. In September 2016 a full federal court decision upheld the tribunal\u2019s ruling. But less than two weeks ago, Dreyfus\u2019s lawyers wrote to the Australian government solicitor accusing Brandis of \u201ccontinued avoidance of his obligation to process\u201d the FoI request because he still hadn\u2019t released his diary. The letter said that Brandis had had six months since the full federal court decision to process the request but \u201chas continued to behave in a manner that is contemptuous\u201d of the decision and the FoI Act. It threatened if Brandis did not process the request by 20 March, Labor would seek a court order to set a deadline for the attorney general, after which it could begin contempt of court proceedings. \u201cNo explanation for this delay has ever been proffered nor have we been given any reasons why the application has not been processed,\u201d the letter said. On Monday, Dreyfus said the saga \u2013 which cost taxpayers tens of thousands of dollars \u2013 had been a \u201cmonumental waste of everyone\u2019s time\u201d. \u201cWhat a waste of of taxpayers\u2019 money, of public servants\u2019 time, of the court\u2019s time just because of \u2013 apparently \u2013 the attorney general\u2019s vanity,\u201d he told ABC radio. He said it was notable there was no evidence in the diary that Brandis had met with legal assistance services, including Environmental Defenders Offices and Community Legal Centres, before cutting their funding in 2014. A spokesman for Brandis said Dreyfus had been told some meetings would not have appeared in the diary because they were scheduled at short notice. \u201cProcessing Mr Dreyfus\u2019s request was a long and exhaustive task and had to be done on top of the attorney\u2019s ministerial and other responsibilities,\u201d the spokesman told the ABC. \u201cAppropriate redactions had to be made to the diary before it was released. Many meetings or appointments happen spontaneously or at short notice.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
