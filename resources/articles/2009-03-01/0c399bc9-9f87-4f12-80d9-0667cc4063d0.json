From tomorrow, the Hearst Corporation daily becomes an online news outlet. It's by far the largest American newspaper to take the leap. You can see the announcement to staff by publisher Roger Oglesby here on the paper's website plus a brief thank you to staff by managing editor David McCumber. Their upset is plain to witness, along with the strained faces of staff in the background. The P-I, as it is called, will have a news staff of about 20 people, rather than the 165 it has had. There will be some original reporting but the site will consist mostly of commentary, advice and links to other news sites. It has recruited some current and former government officials to write columns, and it will keep some of the popular columnists and bloggers who already work there, in addition to the large number of unpaid local bloggers whose work appears on the site. The P-I already has about 1.8m unique visitors a month, according to Nielsen Online. Its print demise has been anticipated since Hearst announced on January 9 that they would put the paper up for sale for 60 days. If no buyer emerged it would be closed. I reported on the web-only likelihood here 10 days ago. Finding a buyer was always considered a long shot. Newspapers across the US are reeling as advertising revenue plummets. The P-I lost $14m last year, according to Hearst, and its transition to an all-digital product will be closely watched in an industry that is fast losing revenue, is casting around for a new economic model and still relies on print for about 90% of its revenue. The P-I was founded in 1863 and acquired in 1921 by William Randolph Hearst. Its most recent circulation figures show it selling 127,000 on weekdays and 420,000 on Sundays. It is not known whether the the rival paper, The Seattle Times, will benefit. It may pick up buyers but it has long enjoyed a joint operating agreement with the P-I, so it will have to fund all its overheads in future. It is one of the few big city papers independently operated and owned by a local family (the Blethens).
