The side rallied yesterday to equalise spectacularly and then hit the woodwork on two occasions in stoppage-time, but Manchester United, glancing over their shoulder, have to peer a little further than expected to make out their nearest pursuers. Should the champions overcome Newcastle United, who are unbeaten in eight games, on Wednesday, they will still be five points adrift of Sir Alex Ferguson's team. Arsenal were opponents of substance yesterday and, in their Champions League system, tamed the match for extended periods. Chelsea were subdued in a commonplace first-half and the increasing difficulty of retaining the title removes much of the manager's room for manoeuvre. Mourinho had stated that Andriy Shevchenko is not one of the \"untouchables\" when it comes to picking the line-up. That remark was a warning, but if the Ukrainian heeded it he could not act upon it against Arsenal. In addition to performing moderately the \u00a330m signing has necessitated a switch in tactics. The system, with two strikers, has certainly been productive on occasion, but the improvement was radical when Mourinho took off Shevchenko so that he could have two wingers, in the substitutes Shaun Wright-Phillips and Arjen Robben, on either side of Didier Drogba. That 4-3-3 formation had width and penetration to bring down havoc on Arsenal's heads. Mourinho's scope could be limited, though, if a scan on Drogba's hamstring sees him ruled out of the Newcastle game. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side have cause to be pleased with themselves. A fairly young Arsenal line-up, lacking Kolo Tour\u00e9 and William Gallas, might have smuggled a win out of Stamford Bridge, although it would not have been merited. As it is, they rue a foul by their former left-back Ashley Cole on Alexander Hleb that went unnoticed in the build-up to the 84th-minute equaliser. Whatever consolation exists is to be found in the fact that the goal truly rested on magnificent technique and dynamism. Robben and Frank Lampard combined before Michael Essien smashed a swerving drive into the top corner of the net from more than 30 yards. By then, it had appeared Arsenal were equipped to survive. Johan Djourou came through the afternoon well in the callow back four and while Philippe Senderos did have flashbacks to previous traumas inflicted by Drogba, there was no collapse. In front of the defence, the captain, Gilberto Silva, was crucial in making Chelsea's build-up seem ordinary. That durability depended, too, on the free-running of Emmanuel Adebayor that stopped Chelsea from enjoying total security as he set up half-chances for team-mates including Cesc F\u00e1bregas. So close a contest between these clubs spawned irritability that assumed comic form in an incident between Jens Lehmann and Drogba. The goalkeeper believed the forward had dived when tackled by Senderos and the Ivorian bristled in response. It would be doing them too much credit to argue that they exchanged genuine shoves. Perhaps Alan Wiley actually booked the pair for bringing themselves into disrepute with such simulation. More often, the competitiveness was genuine. Only with Mourinho's first home Premiership defeat in sight were Arsenal beleaguered and it had never looked inconceivable that they could open the scoring. After 78 minutes, Mathieu Flamini slipped the ball wide to Hleb, took the return pass and shot home. The goalkeeper Hilario, deputising for the injured Carlo Cudicini, got his hands to the ball and should have stopped it reaching the net, confirming the feeling that he is an unsatisfactory alternative while the club continues to miss Petr Cech badly. Hilario can be glad that he was not put to the test all that often by Arsenal. The visiting fans crowed all the more at the goal because it had been Cole, funnelling in the middle, who had allowed Hleb such latitude. Chelsea's defence, involved only sporadically, was vulnerable to that kind of lapse and the Arsenal back four were more often on the alert. In the 18th minute, Drogba headed on a throw-in and Lampard sent a left-footed effort against a post. Chelsea's metabolic rate quickened noticeably following the substitutions. With 71 minutes gone, Senderos swiped horribly to send the ball out to Robben and the Dutchman went through for a drive that cannoned off Lehmann. Gilberto was sharp to stop Drogba from snapping up the loose ball. Two minutes into stoppage-time, John Terry met a corner and Essien, contorting himself to reach the knock-down, struck the bar. Later still, Lehmann let a Robben effort slip from his grasp, only for Lampard's attempt to squeeze the ball home to be thwarted as a faint touch from the studs of the covering Flamini eased it on to a post. Chelsea were deflated at the end, bemused that for once they had not quite imposed their will. Manchester United are starting to imagine that they can compel the champions to get even better acquainted with disappointment.
