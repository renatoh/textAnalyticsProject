The results, coupled with Warrington\u2019s defeat at home to St Helens on Thursday, means the top three Super League sides are separated by one point. Castleford boosted their outside chances of making the play-offs against a jaded-looking Hull side, continually catching the hosts napping from dummy half to exploit openings on both wings and reach the break 20-0 up. Hull\u2019s coach, Lee Radford, said: \u201cOne team rolled their sleeves up and turned up the tempo and the other team didn\u2019t. Whether that\u2019s a physical thing or a mental thing I don\u2019t know. It might have been a bit of both.\u201d His side fell behind in the fourth minute when Greg Minikin scored in the left-hand corner, ducking under a weak Carlos Tuimavave tackle following Denny Solomona\u2019s powerful break downfield after gathering a high kick deep in his own half. After an unusual four interchanges in the 17th minute Ryan Hampshire scored the first of his two tries, cutting back on the inside in the right-hand corner through a gap left by the ragged Hull defence. The coach, Daryl Powell, said: \u201cI thought that making four changes at that time could give us an advantage and it did.\u201d Luke Gale made it 10-0 with his first successful conversion of the night and he was quickest to a loose ball to dive over for a simple try. Worse was to come for Hull as a try disallowed for offside after Carlos Tuimavave took a skied ball from an offside position was immediately followed by Luke Dorn dummying extravagantly at the other end to bamboozle a tired-looking defensive line. Gale\u2019s conversion completed the scoring before the interval. A superb Rangi Chase offload close to the line sent Hampshire careering over for his second try of the night, before Hull had another disallowed when Steve Michaels\u2019 trailing leg was found by the video referee to have brushed touch before he grounded the ball. However, Michaels finally got his side off the mark in the 63rd minute, the start of a flurry for his side that briefly threatened to set up a lively finish. Danny Washbrook added a second and an outstanding Frank Pritchard charge and offload set up Jamie Shaul by the posts, easily converted to make it 24-16 with 13 minutes remaining. However, the scoring was rounded off by Castleford\u2019s Adam Milner, who walked through in the final minute to leave his side in sixth, seven points outside the top four to compound Hull\u2019s misery and leave his side seven points behind the top four. Meanwhile at the DW Stadium Wigan bounced back from their Challenge Cup disappointment against Hull to blitz a depleted Wakefield. The Wigan full-back, Sam Tomkins, scored two of his side\u2019s 11 tries, taking his total for the club to 150, as they ended their three-match losing run in style. The Wigan coach, Shaun Wane, said: \u201cI\u2019m very pleased but I\u2019m not getting carried away. We tweaked a few things in training and it just clicked. We saw a different class of attack tonight.\u201d It was sweet revenge for Wigan\u2019s humiliating 62-0 thrashing by Wakefield in April when Wane\u2019s side were badly hit by injury and illness. This time Wakefield went into the game with 13 senior players on the injury list and were forced to hand debuts to the teenagers Judah Mazive and Frazer Morris. The home side were in charge of a massively one-sided match from the fifth minute when the stand-off George Williams broke the visitors\u2019 defence with a jinking run to score their first try and his half-back partner Matty Smith kicked the first of his three goals. Four minutes later the Wigan hooker Sam Powell forced his way over from dummy half and, before Wakefield had time to regroup, the centre Oliver Gildart followed up Williams\u2019s grubber kick to send the left-winger, Josh Charnley, over. On 27 minutes Tomkins dummied his way over before Wakefield briefly hit back through the centre Joe Arundel, who crossed for their only try of the first half. But second-row John Bateman went on a weaving run on the last tackle to earn his first try for three months while a barnstorming charge from the recent signing Frank-Paul Nuuausala created the position for Gildart to go over. After the break Dom Manfredi plucked a Miller pass out of the air to sprint 90 metres for a try to set the scoreboard ticking again. The substitute Jake Shorrocks took over goalkicking duties after failures by Smith and Charnley and scored his first points for the club with the first of five conversions. Williams jinked his way over for his second try and the impressive Bateman sliced through Wakefield\u2019s defence to send the centre Dan Sarginson and Tomkins over. An interception try from the Wakefield winger Craig Hall briefly halted the one-way traffic but Wigan had the final say when Bateman dribbled the ball through before sending Smith over for the game\u2019s final try. Mazive was praised by his coach, Chris Chester, after being pressed into action shortly after returning early from the England academy tour of Australia due to the death of his father. \u201cHe trained with us during the week and we just wanted to see what his state of mind was like. He\u2019s a nice kid and a tough kid. He gave it a real go tonight. He\u2019s certainly been through a lot this last couple of weeks and he\u2019s a credit not just to himself but to his family as well.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
