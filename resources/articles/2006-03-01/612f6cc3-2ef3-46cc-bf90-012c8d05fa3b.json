Speculation has grown in Westminster tonight that Ms Jowell will be cleared by the cabinet secretary, Gus O'Donnell, after \"senior sources\" briefed journalists including the BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, that the culture secretary had not breached the ministerial code. The terms of Sir Gus's investigation, which may produce a report as early as tomorrow or Friday, are a \"matter for him,\" No 10 said. \"But I would be very surprised if he did not take into account the fact that there has been a categorical denial from the Home Office\" - which has not been challenged - the Downing Street spokesman said. In answer to Tory MP Richard Bacon, who asked about claims of Home Office obstruction, Mr Blair told MPs that \"we will of course examine any allegations that are made\". By that he meant future challenges - not ones that have already been denied - No 10 told political reporters. The Home Office responded to media reports by saying there was nothing abnormal in the way it responded to the Italian prosecutors inquiry - in replying via the Italian government even though its head - Silvio Berlusconi - stood to be involved in the case. If individual prosecutors could obtain extradition of individuals from another country it would soon lead \"to circumstances no one would tolerate,\" No 10 said. Mr Blair retains \" full confidence\" in Ms Jowell, the spokesman added. Tonight the shadow home secretary, David Davis, wrote to Sir Gus to ask for his judgment on the accusation by Italian judicial authorities that actions of the Home Office in the Italian extradition request caused \"blatant\" damage to their investigative secrecy. In his letter, Mr Davis wrote: \"If true, this action by the Home Office meets neither the letter nor the spirit of proper practice. Accordingly it is either at best incompetent or at worst improper. I would be grateful for your judgement on this\" Cameron ups pressure Earlier the Conservative leader, David Cameron, piled on the pressure on Ms Jowell with his first intervention in the row over her husband's business relationship with Mr Berlusconi. He said: \"We have an inquiry going on under Gus O'Donnell; I think that inquiry needs to be widened to cover some of the allegations that are in the newspapers about the Home Office blocking extradition and things like that.\" Downing Street insisted that ministers had not been in anyway involved in the Italian extradition request. The latest twist in the complex saga of Mr Mills' financial transactions saw newspapers today claim that the Home Office undermined the secrecy of their investigation into Mr Mills by passing written evidence relating to his extradition to the Italian justice ministry. \"This was handled in the normal way,\" the PM's official spokesman said. \"I think the criticism would have been if we had handled this in any other way. \"This was dealt with official to official. Ministers were not consulted. \"The Home Office could not have been clearer in saying that normal procedures were followed. These are internationally accepted normal procedures.\" 'Maverick prosecutors' The spokesman said that the procedures had been agreed internationally in order to prevent \"maverick prosecutors\" seeking the extradition of individuals from another country. He added: \"In this country the tradition is that someone is innocent unless they are proved guilty. Because the Italian justice system operates in a different way that doesn't mean that we will deviate from that nor should we.\" With storm clouds gathering over Ms Jowell's career - she signed a joint mortgage statement which allegedly may have helped her husband release money to reinvest payments he received - the PM's spokesman said that he was not aware that Ms Jowell had at any stage offered her resignation over the matter. The vice-chair of the Tory party, Nigel Evans, declared he would be formally writing to the Home Office to ask about its role in the Italian investigation, calling the convoluted affair \"murkier and murkier and all we're getting is smoke and mirrors\". \"I would like to know from the Home Office what they have done in their dealings with Italian prosecutors,\" he said. The MP for the Ribble Valley said Ms Jowell's position was \"untenable\" if she did not answer outstanding questions about how she paid off her mortgage. \"If she doesn't answer the questions and she doesn't answer them properly, her position is untenable,\" he said. \"Did she know about the 'gift' and if she knew it wasn't from Berlusconi, does she know its provenance? \"Did she register the 'gift' with the permanent secretary as she is obliged to do under the ministerial code? Did she register the 'gift' with the Inland Revenue? \"It gets murkier and murkier, and all we're getting is smoke and mirrors.\" Mr Mills is facing questions over an alleged \u00a3350,000 bribe from Mr Berlusconi, which Italian prosecutors claim was a payment for helping the premier escape corruption charges. He has denied the money came from Mr Berlusconi. Home Office denial The Home Office insisted last night that no ministers were involved in any of the decisions relating to Mr Mills. In a statement it said: \"In late 2004 the Serious Fraud Office received a request from the Milan prosecutor for legal advice about the circumstances in which David Mills could be extradited under UK law, based upon possible charges against him. The request was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service who took legal advice which was passed by the Home Office to the Italian embassy in May 2005 since extradition requests are normally handled on diplomatic channels.\" Ms Jowell denies any impropriety or that the money came from Mr Berlusconi. Mr Mills today insisted there was nothing suspicious about his mortgage arrangements. And he dismissed as \"bollocks\" claims that he had suborned his wife into assisting in the processing of a bribe. Mr Mills told the Daily Telegraph that he wanted to scotch the rumours that he was using the mortgage to launder money. Wrong man for the job Today, Lord Armstrong, the former cabinet secretary who served Margaret Thatcher in the 80s, said that, as a civil servant, Sir Gus should not be asked to investigate the allegations. \"It seems to me that in these matters the role of the cabinet secretary should be above all to advise the prime minister privately and in confidence and then for the prime minister to make his judgment,\" he told BBC Radio 4's the World at One programme. \"I don't myself feel very comfortable with the idea that the cabinet secretary is used as a kind of public auditor on these matters. I think it puts him into an invidious and difficult position. \"In past times it has very often been done by a senior minister or by the chief whip. I think that is a better way of dealing with it in that the politician would then be judging the politicians.\" \"In past times it has very often been done by a senior minister or by the chief whip.
