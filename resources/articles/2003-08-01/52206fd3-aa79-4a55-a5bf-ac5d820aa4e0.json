It is easy to see what he has in mind. The trouble is that, in practice, questions about the economy lead to other than economics answers. (This is quite different from economists, who try to explain everything in the world within the framework of neo-classical economics. Most of what they have to say at best throws little light on anything, and at worst is pure garbage.) In trying to explain economic development, for example, it is interesting to note, after much sophisticated theory coupled with state-of-the-art econometric examination of the economic data, how attention is then concentrated on so-called institutional factors to explain why some countries grow faster than another. This is especially so when it comes to trying to account for the economic failure of much of sub-Saharan Africa. But it also occurs when we try to explain what has happened to inflation at home in the past eight to 10 years. Attention is paid to the precise policies pursued, but we also point to the setting up of the MPC five years ago. Presumably, both views must be part of the truth. It must be sensible to emphasise the role of the policy instrument in keeping the rise in aggregate demand in line with aggregate supply over the medium term at a level of capacity utilisation broadly equal to full employment. But it is also sensible to stress the value of setting up an institution that is required to do this, and is separate from government. If institutional reform is an essential prerequisite of our inflation policy success, would the same be true if our objective were to improve our ability to operate fiscal policy, both in the short and medium terms? And if the answer is yes, what effect does that have on government in general, and fiscal policy in particular? There is no space to answer here, but it is something the Lords committee might examine next year. Instead, I want to show how the same question arises in the context of economic development. The Economic Affairs committee spent last year looking at globalisation. What emerged is that concentrating on economics as a discipline designed to explain economic events did not work. No matter what our inclinations in favour of concentrating on economic forces, we were driven inexorably to the institutional structure in which they were played out. We were given a vast amount of evidence about the role of market forces, the need for openness, free trade in goods and services of all kinds, fiscal balance, monetary discipline and everything found in an economics textbook. From this, it appeared that there was no secret about what is required for economic success, and how poor countries can become richer. In this connection we were most impressed by Paul Krugman's proposition: 'All of the success stories are export-led growth. All of them are by getting into the global economy.' The difficulty we had was when it came to explaining why some countries were more successful than others, and some were not successful at all. The answers we were given then rapidly moved away from economics, and involved other disciplines, chiefly the most basic of all, ad hocery. We were referred to cultural problems, lack of an entrepreneurial tradition, no proper financial system, unstable government, a dishonest legal set-up within which contracts cannot be enforced and so on. Nicholas Stern put all this as clearly as possible. 'It is important to ask why [sub-Saharan Africa] has suffered. I do not think it has much to do with openness to trade, although they are, in fact, quite open to trade. It has more to do with governance issues, with conflict, with weakness of infrastructure, corruption the tragedy of HIV/Aids, malaria, TB and so on.' He is not alone in saying this, and nobody would suggest he is entirely mistaken, although corruption was part and parcel of the early stages of development both here and in the US. My concern is with economists who, when they run into trouble, say that the remedies are perfect, if only the people would take them. The analogy is with the compliance problem in medicine, except that the drugs themselves have been rather better tested, and are based more solidly on serious science. Apart from waving our arms, if compliance is of the essence in economic policy, whose job is it to solve the problem? Is it the job of economists to adapt our recommendations to cultural, institutional and political constraints, at least until someone tells us how to overcome them? Obviously, in some cases such as North Korea, the relevant comparison is with Jehovah's Witnesses and blood transfusions. They make their choices, and, while the position is hopeless, there is nothing we can do. But when it comes to sub-Saharan Africa, I simply do not believe in the inevitability of extreme poverty and economic failure. And I certainly do not follow the racist line that the inhabitants of those countries lack the ability to run a modern country. Something more is required than all the clever stuff in a report such as ours, and all the good will of the major international institutions and non-governmental organisations. I just wish I knew what it was. Returning to our own economic problems, what do we make of the MPC at the start of a new era? It is bound by law as to what it must and may do, and by implication what are its limits. There are also the obvious constraints determined by what we know as economists, the state of the economy and the availability of data. What now needs thinking about is, first, whether what has been achieved could only have been done by the MPC, and, second, whether the actual MPC has qualities that are specially helpful to what it is trying to do. Current thinking is that what really matters is independence, but there are several ways of establishing that. As a close MPC watcher, I would argue that the institutional form is better than most. The MPC has kept out of the political arena, and has not set itself a starring role, not even for the Governor. Its structure suits us better than would something like the Federal Reserve, and is infinitely superior to the European Central Bank, not least when it comes to transparency and accountability. Its economic analysis is less doctrinaire and ideological than its counterparts. Altogether, it has done pretty well. On membership, from the outset the Lords committee has rejected the method of appoint ment, and argued that the Chancellor should adopt the Nolan principles, notably of openness. The ludicrous way the most recent appointment was made reinforces that. That has nothing to do with the merits of the person, but simply that this is no longer suitable for modern government. But there is something else that is now worth thinking about. Does it really matter who is appointed? At any moment there must be well over a hundred people from industry, commerce and the academy who are good enough. Given the constraints, and bearing in mind that it is a committee decision, what difference would it make if the choice were made at random from a broad list? I, for one, doubt very much whether the individual appointed makes much difference. Someone like Keynes possibly might, but there has been no one of that quality for decades. My procedure would be for a joint Lords and Commons committee to be entrusted with the task of setting up and maintaining the list of potential members of the MPC, and, when needed, a new member would be drawn by lot, the whole exciting business being shown on television!
