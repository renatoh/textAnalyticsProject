In that time there have been multiple meetings between newspapers, ministers and civil servants but no agreement on the future shape of press regulation. This unsatisfactory state of affairs now threatens to scupper the one opportunity in a generation of sorting out Britain's dismal libel laws \u2013 as well as derailing other bills close to the government's heart. The problems started with the instant political response to the Leveson report. The Liberal Democrats and Labour insisted the judge's recommendations be adopted in full. The prime minister rejected the statutory back-up proposed by Lord Justice Leveson, thereby opening the door for bipartite discussions between Conservative ministers and newspapers. But David Cameron was unable to deliver the concessions he offered during these private talks. Meanwhile, those excluded from the negotiations grew understandably sceptical \u2013 and some felt forced to use guerilla tactics to implement Leveson by means of amendments to other legislation, including the defamation bill. Tuesday's meeting is therefore aimed at what Mr Cameron should have done earlier: establishing common ground between the political parties. But is there common ground with the press? Mr Cameron's big idea was to get round the \"statutory\" element of Leveson \u2013 such as it was \u2013 by the use of a royal charter to establish a panel to kitemark the workings of an independent regulator. This is itself, of course, a form of statute \u2013 but it is via the back door of Buckingham Palace rather than the front door of Westminster. The proposal met with support \u2013 albeit reluctant \u2013 from several corners of Fleet Street, including the Daily Mail and the Times. But Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg \u2013 and a significant number of Tories \u2013 want to ensure that a royal charter could not be unpicked by ministers of the day. For them, it would be better to have a statutory clause requiring a two thirds majority in parliament before the charter could be amended or withdrawn. To some in the press this is quite unacceptable. They genuinely believe that, by agreeing to even the most limited clause of this nature, they would cede a significant element of control over the press to parliament. In the most apocalyptic version of this, we are at a historic moment where editors must stand and fight, or else surrender 300 years of press freedom. Some go further and want to have the right to veto any independent members of a future regulator. This is a high stakes game in which the assumption is that, as always in the past, the politicians will blink first. But what if they don't? A clause underpinning a royal charter to establish a recognition panel for a press regulator does not, to our minds, amount to statutory control of the press. We do not see it as a threat to press freedom. If we're to have a backdoor constitutional fudge over press regulation, it's better that it could be amended only in the open with the agreement of an overwhelming majority of parliament. A royal prerogative that can be unpicked by ministers in private does not feel like a solid bastion of free expression. The press finds it difficult to report on its own affairs \u2013 hence the curious silence over the past few months, as its representatives have tried to negotiate an agreement with one party in government. This is now bound to change. To be clear, we are strongly opposed to some of the measures being proposed by politicians \u2013 such as the threat of exemplary damages to news organisations that remain outside regulation. At the same time we don't believe a press veto on appointments could be acceptable to MPs or to an independent appointments panel. But a public inquiry demands a public response and a public debate. The derailing of parliamentary bills through Leveson amendments is clumsy and blunt \u2013 but it is forcing the issue into the open where it belongs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
