A Fifa spokesperson said: \u201cPlease note that Fifa is currently looking into the matter at this stage. Further updates will be provided in due course.\u201d The Guardian understands that as part of the investigation Fifa is looking into all aspects of Cameroon\u2019s behaviour and the allegations and comments made by the players and the manager, Alain Djeumfa. Reports from the match officials and the match commissioner, Alexandra Benado of Chile, are being compiled. Usually, action cannot be taken unless there are recommendations for it in either report. However, article 72 of Fifa\u2019s disciplinary code states: \u201cIn certain circumstances, the jurisdiction of the judicial bodies may apply.\u201d Article 77 says the disciplinary committee is able to sanction \u201cserious infringements which have escaped the match officials\u2019 attention\u201d, rectify \u201cobvious errors in the referee\u2019s disciplinary decisions\u201d and pronounce \u201cadditional sanctions, such as a fine\u201d. These rules mean that Fifa does potentially have the power to step in and retrospectively sanction Alexandra Takounda\u2019s late stamp on Steph Houghton, the incident when Augustine Ejangue seemingly spat on the outstretched arm of Toni Duggan and Yvonne Leuko\u2019s early elbow in the face of Nikita Parris. \u201cIn theory, yes we can do it,\u201d a source said. Fifa officials are thought to be furious at complaints that the flag went up for offside before Ellen White took her shot for England\u2019s second goal, with video footage clearly showing that she was still celebrating before the flag was raised. Had it gone up before the shot, the goal would not have stood because VAR could not be used. It is also believed Fifa has officially adjudged the performance of the referee, China\u2019s Qin Liang, as good and found \u201cevery decision and the use of VAR was correct, using the protocols\u201d and were applied to the letter. Officials also think Qin did all she could to ensure a prompt restart after the VAR delays. It is understood that Fifa accepts mistakes do happen and the referee\u2019s decisions to overrule VAR advice on Fran Kirby\u2019s penalty appeal and a possible Takounda red card incident late in the game were the best ways to make certain the game came to a conclusion with both teams on the pitch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
