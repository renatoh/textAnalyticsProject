People were still talking about City going through the season unbeaten when Chelsea won 2-0 at Stamford Bridge in December. A raft of speculative features about who could possibly stop Pep Guardiola\u2019s winning machine suddenly became redundant when Crystal Palace and Leicester added their names to the list in the same month. City have steadied the ship since the turn of the year, getting away with a lapse at Newcastle thanks to Liverpool failing to cash in against Leicester and West Ham, but Chelsea arrive with their own need for points, having had the assumption of a top-four finish challenged by Manchester United\u2019s revival. Maurizio Sarri\u2019s side had something of an aberration, too, when attempting to play Eden Hazard as a central focus of attack, but have signed Gonzalo Higua\u00edn since and are ostensibly stronger than they were a couple of months ago. \u201cHigua\u00edn is a striker of exceptional quality, the type of guy who doesn\u2019t need too much to score a goal,\u201d Guardiola said. City have one or two players of their own who fit that description, though Sarri does not believe it will be a game of many chances and reckons it might not be decided by the forwards. \u201cThe midfield of Manchester City is one of the best in the world,\u201d the Chelsea manager said. \u201cNot only Fernandinho but also Kevin De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, David Silva. Technically there is nothing better in Europe, so it will be really difficult to be in control of the match, but I think that is the area that will decide the game, more than the strikers. They are still able to play if you manage to stop Fernandinho, we are able to play if you stop Jorginho. We have options in midfield, but maybe they have more options than us.\u201d Guardiola encountered Sarri in Champions League group-stage games against Napoli last season and is an admirer of both his old team and his new one. \u201cI liked watching Napoli and I can see what he is trying to do with Chelsea,\u201d the City manager said. What Sarri is principally trying to do with Chelsea is earn enough points to guarantee Champions League football next season. Like City, Chelsea cannot afford many more slip-ups, which is one reason Guardiola has referred to Sunday\u2019s game as a cup final. While that might be overplaying it slightly, bearing in mind that the same teams meet in a real cup final in two weeks, there is no doubt that it comes at the end of a demanding and significant week. Guardiola has preferred not to dwell on what Liverpool have been doing, but if City are able to take all nine points from playing Arsenal, Everton and Chelsea in the space of eight days it will magnify the potential importance of points lost by their rivals in recent matches. That is not Guardiola playing mind games, that is simply what the Premier League table has to say. Were the City manager interested in making Liverpool feel more jittery he would have been pointing out how tough it is to go out in front and stay there. Instead he has kept a consistent focus on his own team\u2019s performances. \u201cIf we win against Chelsea I am sure we will be fighting to be champions again at the end of the season,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cThis season is a bit different from the last two or three, it might be a battle right to the end. That is what I like about it. People say we underestimated Newcastle, or opponents in Europe, or whatever, but I say we are in the Carabao Cup final and still fighting in all the competitions. We don\u2019t underestimate anyone. \u201cIn the last five or six years no English champion has managed to put up a decent defence the following season, but we intend to do so and we are not giving up.\u201d That seems to have been noticed on Merseyside, though Guardiola is dismissive of suggestions that after 29 years in the title wilderness Liverpool lack the winning mentality necessary to become champions. \u201cI\u2019m not buying that at all,\u201d the City manager said. \u201cThis is a team that went all the way to the Champions League final last season. Maybe Leicester and West Ham just did a good job. I don\u2019t think Liverpool dropping points had anything to do with their mentality. It is easy to drop points in this league, as we know, but all I can say is that when you are seven points behind you are under pressure to reduce that lead. \u201cWe have done that, we have had two tough games in a week and the important thing is that we did not lose those games. If we get through the next one we will have a gap of six days to recover, and we will probably need it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
