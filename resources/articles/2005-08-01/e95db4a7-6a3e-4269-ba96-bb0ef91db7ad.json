A source close to Media Sports Investment, the consortium headed by the Iranian-born businessman Kia Joorabchian, confirmed last night that significant moves are expected \"in the next couple of days\". MSI has already held talks with the West Ham board in London this month, when it was quoted a price of \u00a360m for the club's equity, according to Joorabchian, MSI's chief executive. Added to that would be the club's declared debts of \u00a330m and investments in its infrastructure and team. However, MSI feels the price is reasonable. \"You have to look at what is available on the market,\" said the source. \"Chelsea is not for sale, Aston Villa are talking about \u00a378m, Newcastle would want \u00a3200m to take the club private, Tottenham also want \u00a3200m and Arsenal would be \u00a3400m at least.\" MSI is seeking a foothold in Europe after bringing Corinthians to the top of Brazil's national championship since buying the club last year. The takeover caused controversy in Brazil, where there was speculation, denied by Joorabchian, that the Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and his fellow Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky had funded MSI. Joorabchian, a 34-year-old British passport holder, had had no previous experience in football. The Sao Paulo club has built its on-pitch success this season with the influx, at considerable expense, of some of South America's finest players, including the Argentinians Carlos T\u00e9vez and Javier Mascherano. Corinthians have signed a Brazilian-record sponsorship deal with Samsung - whose mobile-telephone arm is Chelsea's title sponsor - and gates have increased threefold this season. Last night Joorabchian said that if MSI did proceed with its offer for West Ham, it would not take control until January at the earliest. \"If there is any bid made, it will only be for next year. But if next week the board of directors decides that they want to start to make a bid to take over in January, then we may do that.\" Joorabchian added the caveat that if a better proposition emerges - and Aston Villa are understood to be available - MSI may look elsewhere. \"We are still going to look at one or two other clubs at least to see what is going on,\" he added. Joorabchian is, however, believed to be eager to own a club in the capital, and one of significant status. West Ham's heritage, with three FA Cup wins and a European Cup Winners' Cup in 1965, makes them a marketable commodity. Promotion to the Premiership in May added to the attraction but, ironically, it was relegation two seasons before that displayed West Ham's suitability for Joorabchian. \"The consortium wanted a London club,\" added the source, \"and something like Fulham will never be a big club. But West Ham were attracting crowds of 30,000 when they were in the Football League. Those fans are amazing.\" West Ham is owned principally by a small group of shareholders, including the chairman Terry Brown, and two families that have long-term stakes in the club, the Cearns and the Hills. Brown has indicated he would consider any bid, with a likely prerequisite being the transfer of funds to a neutral account as proof of financing. \"As yet we have received no creditable bids,\" said Brown in his programme notes to the 3-1 win over Blackburn on Saturday. \"A short-term gain could be long-term pain, but any serious proposition will be carefully studied. I am not about protecting my position. I know I am a mere custodian of the club.\" The exact provenance of the investment fund's finances is unclear, but any fears Upton Park crowds may have for their club's future would soon be mitigated by Joorabchian's stated intention to invest \u00a350m once he takes control."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
