The former vice-president\u2019s abrupt announcement that he now opposes the Hyde amendment, just days after his campaign had announced his support for it, confirms \u2013 if anyone doubted it \u2013 that abortion is on the ballot in 2020. Despite the conventional wisdom, which holds that abortion only motivates voters on the right, history suggests otherwise: boldly supporting a woman\u2019s right to legal abortion is a winning strategy for Democrats on the road to the White House. When the issue of abortion is activated during a presidential campaign \u2013 like it was in 1992 and 2012 \u2013 it results in big wins for Democrats. Just as the 1992 presidential campaign was heating up, the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the supreme court sparked national debate about abortion. His confirmation \u2013 despite Anita Hill\u2019s credible testimony about sexual harassment \u2013 tipped the bench to the conservatives. Roe looked doomed. But in a June 1992 ruling, three Republican appointees joined the court\u2019s liberals to reaffirm women\u2019s constitutional right to legal abortion. Seven weeks later, an unpopular president, George HW Bush, surrendered the Republican convention to the only people he thought could keep him in power \u2013 the anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ, radical religious right. The platform, over Bush\u2019s personal objection, called for banning abortion from the moment of conception. From the stage, rightwing leaders denounced \u201cabortion on demand\u201d, \u201chomosexual rights\u201d and \u201cradical feminism\u201d. Bush\u2019s gambit with the religious right backfired. Bush was crushed by a counterforce galvanized by Republican attacks on reproductive freedom and women\u2019s rights. In the spring, upwards of 1 million people marched in Washington in the nation\u2019s largest ever demonstration for reproductive freedom. In November, a record number of women were elected to Congress \u2013 most of them backed by the pro-choice group Emily\u2019s List. Bush received only 37.5% of the popular vote. 1992 went down in history as the (first) year of the woman. To be sure, 1992 deserved its Clintonworld moniker: \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d The poor economy was the No 1 issue for the majority of voters. Yet Bill Clinton had also campaigned as a champion of reproductive rights, and that paid off. Post-election analyses showed that support for legal abortion had the second strongest effect of any issue on vote choice. In addition, for a quarter of all voters, abortion \u2013 not the economy \u2013 was the No 1 issue. Republicans were on the wrong side of public opinion on abortion, and that proved enormously costly for Bush. Support for legal abortion in all circumstances reached a then record high of 61%, with two-thirds of Democrats and independents \u2013 and even a majority of Republicans \u2013 holding pro-choice views. Altogether, according to a study by the political scientist Alan Abramowitz, Bush lost one out of six Republicans over the GOP\u2019s opposition to abortion, as pro-choice Republicans defected to Clinton or Ross Perot. 2012 featured a similar \u2013 if more surprising \u2013 showdown over women\u2019s reproductive rights. As Republicans began casting their primary votes, the GOP House convened all-male hearings to denounce the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that health insurance cover birth control. Over the course of the campaign, the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, called Roe v Wade \u201cone of the darkest moments in supreme court history\u201d, published an op-ed against the birth control mandate and pledged to \u201cget rid of\u201d Planned Parenthood. Meanwhile, Republican-controlled states were passing a wave of invasive and unnecessary restrictions on abortion care. For good measure, Republican Senate candidates floated outrageous theories about rape and pregnancy. In 2012, as in 1992, vocal support for reproductive freedom helped elect a Democratic president and Senate. Barack Obama, like Clinton before, leaned into the fight. A post-election study by scholars Melissa Deckman and John McTague found that the birth control mandate was overwhelmingly popular. They concluded it \u201cwas a winning issue for the Democratic party\u201d and particularly decisive in Obama\u2019s whopping 7.5m vote margin with women. In short, in two of the most consequential elections of recent years, Republicans\u2019 anti-abortion extremism galvanized a pro-choice majority to give Democrats control of the White House and Senate. 2020 looks to repeat that history \u2013 unless Democrats nominate someone out of step with their voters\u2019 views. Someone who, say, supports the Hyde amendment. Support for access to legal abortion remains strong and stable nationwide, with two-thirds of Americans opposed to overturning Roe v Wade. Even in Georgia, where one of the most restrictive bans was enacted, 70% are opposed to overturning Roe. Likewise, recent elections provide compelling evidence that defending legal abortion is still a winner. In 2018, following the Kavanaugh hearings, which injected the fate of Roe and the issue of sexual assault into the campaign, exit polls showed 66% of voters favored keeping Roe as is. Democrats won seven in 10 of those pro-Roe voters. Democrats flipped two Senate seats, four governorships and 23 House seats with proudly pro-choice female candidates. (And that\u2019s not even counting the many pro-choice men who also won.) Looking ahead to 2020 and the key pickup states, the advantage lies with those who support legal abortion. In the \u201cblue wall\u201d states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Minnesota, more than 54% think abortion should be legal in all or most cases \u2013 by a 12- to 18-point margin over those who think it should be illegal in all or most cases. It would be a mistake for Democrats to stay quiet or support middling positions on abortion. To their credit, most of the Democratic presidential candidates have condemned the recent abortion bans, called for the repeal of the Hyde amendment, and proposed protections for women\u2019s reproductive health access. And the female candidates have plans. The takeaway is clear: recent history tells us that when access to legal abortion is openly threatened by politicians beholden to the right, outspoken pro-choice Democratic candidates have the advantage.
