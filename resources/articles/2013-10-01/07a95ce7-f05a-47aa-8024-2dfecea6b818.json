An alcoholic, she had raised seven other children and had suffered domestic violence at the hands of the father of her children, Aftab Khan. The family was known to police and social workers; the children attended school from a home of extreme squalor but action had failed to materialise. Judge Roger Thomas QC described Hutton, arguably mentally unsound, as \"wicked\". Also last week, a serious case review of the death of two-year-old Keanu Williams, beaten to death by his mother, Rebecca Shuttleworth, concluded that Birmingham city council, in spite of 20 reviews of child deaths undertaken in the past seven years, still does not do enough to protect the city's children. Alarmingly, Peter Hay, strategic director for children, young people and families, could offer no assurances about adequate protection in future. \"The situation\u2026 is very serious and very frail,\" he said. His honesty is to be commended but it raises a profoundly disturbing concern both about children at extreme risk and those in families who are just coping. Again and again, we are told that lessons have been learned. These invariably include the impact of generations of abuse and deprivation; the consequences of a high number of social work vacancies; social workers who are inexperienced and with too heavy a caseload; a lack of co-ordination among professionals and sheer inertia. The persistence exercised by police community support officer, Jodie Dunsmore, who, in the case of Hamzah Khan, refused to go away, is rare. If lessons are learned but the outcomes remain the same, then surely it must be time to ask if it is the way that the learning is applied that is at fault? Brigid Featherstone is professor of social care at the Open University. Next year, she and her colleagues Sue White and Kate Morris will publish Reinventing Child Protection: Towards Humane Social Work. Drawing on years of experience, they argue that the current dominant model of social work geared to crisis intervention, hampered by bureaucracy and form filling and with a continuous turnover of staff, won't do. What they propose is teams of social workers embedded in local communities who are more proactive, working with the dynamics of the whole family, not just a mother or a child in isolation. This approach requires professionals with a different ethos who are trained to work with families, over time, tackling difficult and complex questions \u2013 for instance, about the impact of domestic violence; the role of fathers and what the horrendous scapegoating of one child, a terrible repeat pattern, says about maternal ambivalence and how it may be countered. Featherstone et al's work echoes that of Participle, an organisation that redesigns public services in collaboration with service users and staff. For one project, Participle spent more than two years with Ella and her family. They were visited by an endless stream of different professionals, 86% of whose time was spent on systems-driven tasks, otherwise known as red tape, and only 14% in direct contact with the family. \"[Such] families do not feel properly listened to or understood,\" Participle's principal partner Hilary Cottam has written. \"Asked to change, the families have no lived experience of what this might feel like and, worse still, they know that these commands are accompanied by the dead weight of expectation that they can't change\u2026 The system is a costly gyroscope that spins around the families\u2026 [who are] stuck exactly where they are.\" \"Stuck\", as we know, carries a dangerous rate of attrition. Fortunately, in areas of the UK such as Cambridge, Derbyshire and Gateshead, different approaches are being tried. The poorly named Troubled Families programme is also attempting pioneering techniques. They all deserve more resources and greater acknowledgement. The public rarely hears of the benefits of successful social work but it can be of incalculable value, not least to those children who, as a consequence of positive support, unlike the tragic cases of Jasmine Beckford, Daniel Pelka, Baby P, Hamzah Khan, Keanu Williams and too many others, know what it means to be cared for and loved, the right of every child."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
