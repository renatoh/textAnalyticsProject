The first drew a larger audience than Mad Men and was the subject of feverish discussion among fans who greeted each new instalment with the kind of desperate relief more usually seen at the dispensing counter of a methadone clinic. At 10 episodes, the new series is half as long as the original but, on the evidence of last night's double helping, twice as complex. Whereas the plot first time around was an elaborate but essentially linear whodunnit, this time it involves a much wider conspiracy that touches on the \"war on terror\", Afghanistan, Islamist militants and Danish politics. But much else remains the same. For a start, almost every scene is once more shot in the sort of spectral darkness that will have newcomers vainly reaching for the brightness control. There's the sizzling sound of Danish to savour all over again \u2013 a wonderfully incomprehensible noise reminiscent of heavily slurred Scouse. Most of all, of course, there is asocially intense Copenhagen detective Sarah Lund, played by the brilliant Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l, and her equally celebrated co-star, a thick-knit woolly jumper. Some viewers may have been shocked to see that it is no longer the cream patterned number in which Lund set a world record for continuous wear, and which can lay strong claim to be the most famous piece of detective's clothing since Sherlock Holmes hung up his deerstalker. Instead she favoured a red version that was, if not quite the colour of blood, then certainly of foreboding. In all other respects, Lund remained captivatingly muted. And she had much to be muted about. Her life has taken several unhappy turns since the conclusion of the last series, wherein she managed to solve the crime but at the expense of dissolving most of her ties to humanity. Transferred to a lonely border posting, she is living apart from her teenage son and her relationship with the Swedish boyfriend is now as dead as her late colleague Meyer. All in all, she looked in need of a pick-me-up. Fortunately her former boss had just the thing: a woman had been savagely murdered and her body left bound to a pole in a park. Before you could say \"Holy fictional Scandinavian serial killer!\", another corpse was found. And try as she might, Lund was powerless to resist the call to return to frontline homicide work. There was a nice shot of her tormentedly deliberating over whether to pick up the phone, like a lover hopelessly pulled back to a dysfunctional relationship. But like Lucian Freud studying a canvas or Garry Kasparov contemplating a chess move, there is something magnificent and magical about Lund casing a crime scene. She stalks the room in an eerie trance, as though her neck hairs were picking up signals from outer space, and then, without a word, furrows her brow and zooms in on a tiny but critical detail that has eluded the rest of the Danish constabulary. She knew instantly that the prime suspect for the park murder \u2013 the woman's blood-soaked husband \u2013 was the wrong man. Indeed there was a cursory, throat-clearing quality about the manner in which the first red herring was chucked back in the water. In the first series, each false lead was explored with gripping relish, but in this more compressed format there seems to be less adventure in the misadventures. The other missing ingredient is grief. The first series was effectively made up of three elements: the police, the politicians and, most memorably, the bereaved family of the victim. Seldom if ever has television been witness to such an intimate and moving portrait of familial desolation. An enthralling crime procedural also became an affecting investigation into what it means to lose a child. With such powerful emotional realism, the scriptwriter, S\u00f8ren Sveistrup, provided the dramatic ballast to prevent the storyline from ballooning too far off into the realms of the absurd. The closest corollary in last night's first two offerings \u2013 a disturbed ex-soldier and his estranged family \u2013 will struggle to fill the psychological void. Equally, the national politicians have yet to rival the curious charm of their local counterparts in the opening series, and, despite his name, Lund's new partner, Ulrik Strange, isn't quite the abrasive match that made the much missed Meyer such a perfect sidekick the first time around. These are all, however, no more than minor quibbles. For the great and abiding pleasure remains Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l's gloriously inscrutable expression in one of the finest ever demonstrations of undemonstrative acting. Who cares who the killer is? Lund still knocks us dead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
