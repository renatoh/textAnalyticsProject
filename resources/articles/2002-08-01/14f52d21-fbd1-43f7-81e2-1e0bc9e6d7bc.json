That's what has transpired with me. \"I still need Butch, yes, but not as much as I used to because I've got a better understanding of my own game, of the faults that I have and how to fix them. Ball flight, for instance, never lies. \"I know what the cure is for a lot of my faults that I have while I'm playing and that's the whole idea. But Butch, he's got a great eye for the swing, there's no denying that.\" Woods and Harmon have won eight major titles together, starting with the 1997 Masters, Woods's first major as a professional. Now Harmon, who has many top clients including Darren Clarke, will take a back seat. Woods struggled all week at Hazeltine with the driver and the three-wood, and hit only 70% of the fairways. What the statistics do not show is the margin by which he missed some of those fairways, and had he been playing a course with proper rough he would have lost balls and probably missed the cut. In the final round, for instance, he played the short par-four, 357-yard 14th with a four-iron off the tee. That was at a point when he needed desperately to attack because the winner, Rich Beem, was getting away from him. Woods, with a driver, could have driven the green - several players did during the week - and he could have got very close with his three-wood. But he did not dare take either of them, he dropped a vital shot at a vital time, and if the relationship with Harmon really is cooling then it could be the joint failure to work out what was going wrong off the tee last week that caused it. On the other hand, it could be natural causes. Very few golfers stay with one teacher all their careers and Lee Westwood, for instance, recently stopped seeing Harmon to return to his original guru, Pete Cowen. Woods seemed to be signalling that he will still use Harmon from time to time, and that would be wise. He is hugely respected for his knowledge of the game and if they are having differences it is far more likely that it is Harmon who has got it right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
