The Australian Local Government Association is calling on state governments to stop treating hundreds of millions of dollars in landfill levies collected when rubbish was dumped as general revenue, and to instead invest it in long-term recycling and other sustainable waste solutions. On Wednesday Ipswich city council in Queensland announced it would no longer send kerbside waste to be recycled due to skyrocketing costs. The mayor, Andrew Antoniolli, said the cost of recycling in recent contract negotiations had increased fivefold and would have required the council to charge ratepayers an extra $2m a year. On Friday Max Spedding, from the National Waste and Recycling Industry Council, warned that Australia would run out of space to store recycled waste in just a few months. He said three months\u2019 worth of waste had already been stockpiled after China changed its standards for imported waste. Recycling costs have increased since January when China signalled it would not accept shipments of some categories of contaminated waste, with warnings consumers would carry the cost. Ipswich council said it hoped to eventually replace recycling with a waste-to-energy project, announcing a call for tenders. On Friday the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, said he was keen to see waste-to-energy projects developed. \u201cI think this is a very prospective area and it\u2019s one that I\u2019m focused to see projects rolled out across the country,\u201d he told the ABC. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation has committed up to $100m to an new equity fund that aims to create bioenergy and energy from waste. The Australian Council of Recycling and the Waste Management Association of Australia has called on federal and state governments to spend $150m to \u201creboot\u201d the recycling industry by developing infrastructure needed to process recyclable waste domestically. Frydenberg said recycling would be top of the agenda at next week\u2019s meeting of state and territory environment ministers.

The Australian Local Government Association president, David O\u2019Loughlin, said China\u2019s decision had effectively withdrawn the demand for 30% of Australia\u2019s plastic recycling waste. He said in time it would affect every council across the country. He said China had effectively introduced a ban on accepting plastics for recycling under another name by tightening the allowed contamination rate to an unachievable level. He said the association would raise the issue with the trade minister, Steve Ciobo. \u201cWe have trade arrangements with China and there are trade implications here that I think the Australian government should be mindful of,\u201d O\u2019Loughlin said. \u201cIf it could be part of a trend that should at least raise concern. What if they changed contamination standards for coal, iron ore and wheat to a point where ships were turned around at port?\u201d O\u2019Loughlin said the government might need to consider whether it accepted from China new plastics that were costly or difficult to recycle, or placed conditions on how they would be recycled before they were brought into the country. At a domestic level, he said he planned to raise the issue of how landfill levies are spent at next week\u2019s meeting of environment ministers. He said New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia had raised hundreds of millions in levies that were largely not returned to councils or spent on recycling on other sustainable solutions. NSW and Victoria have offered recycling rescue packages worth $47m and $13m respectively to cover increased costs but O\u2019Loughlin said they would need to do more to establish a long-term solution. He said landfill levies were designed as a deterrent to waste going to landfill but that worked only if there was an alternative. \u201cIn the absence of these levies being used to increase recycling in another way it\u2019s just a tax on households,\u201d he said. O\u2019Loughlin\u2019s call follows the Queensland environment minister, Leeanne Enoch, blaming the federal government and former LNP state government for Ipswich council\u2019s decision. \u201cThe decision of China is at a federal level,\u201d she told ABC radio on Thursday. \u201cWhere is the federal leadership on this? It is affecting all of Australia.\u201d Enoch said NSW and Victoria were able to assist with millions of dollars because they had money saved from a waste levy, whereas Queensland\u2019s had been abolished by the former premier Campbell Newman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
