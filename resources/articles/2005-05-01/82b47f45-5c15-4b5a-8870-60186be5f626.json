They also urged the government to build on its work in music education designed to engage all young people in music-making, which included the launch, last year, of a music manifesto and the appointment of a music tsar. The umbrella group Conservatoires UK (CUK) - which represents the seven conservatoires in England, Scotland and Wales - has teamed up with the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) to offer an online application system which they claim is simpler, more transparent and more accessible than the current paper-based one. They hope it will break down the barriers that prevent talented youngsters from applying to study on their over-subscribed undergraduate and postgraduate courses. The link with Ucas and funding from the Higher Education Funding Council for England will also, for the first time, mean that the colleges' track records on widening participation will be made public. Launching the scheme at the Royal College of Music in London, Edward Gregson, chairman of CUK and principal of the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, said there was a perception of conservatoires as \"very middle class and elitist\", and added: \"We are elitist about talent, wherever talent comes from.\" He said that conservatories had a good track record of attracting \"a very wide social strata\", but could do more, while the government had an important role to play too. \"One of the things we have all seen has been the demise of music education in schools. The last government tried to improve the situation with its music manifesto, launched last summer. \"But we need to do even more so that the talented inner-city Salford kid who really wants to be a saxophonist can do that. Although universities now offer a wide range of music undergraduate and postgraduate courses, the long-established conservatoires have a reputation for offering more practical courses geared to needs of aspiring professional musicians.\" The Conservatoires UK Admissions Service is available from this month and is designed for undergraduate and postgraduate applicants who are looking for places on courses starting in 2006 at: Birmingham Conservatoire; Leeds College of Music; Royal College of Music; Royal Northern College of Music; Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama; Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama and Trinity College of Music."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
