Subs: Dreher, Sforza, Fink, Tarnat, Jancker, Zickler, Linke. Man Utd: Barthez, Irwin, Blanc, Brown, Gary Neville, Fortune, Veron, Keane, Beckham, Scholes, van Nistelrooy. Subs: Carroll, Butt, Phil Neville, Chadwick, Yorke, Solskjaer, Silvestre. Referee: A Frisk (Sweden) 1 United, playing in white, get the game underway. Probably the most important match of Sir Alex Ferguson's and United's season so far. 3 Fortune with the early running when he takes on Sagnol on the edge of the Bayern area; Sagnol re-adjusts to usher Fortune wide. Firecrackers and flares at the game have left the pitch shrouded in mist. 5 Salihamidzic sets off down the Bayern right but Brown does well to cut him off and hoof the ball back up the line. 6 Sagnol with a cross to the far post - too long, goal-kick. 8 Dangerous moment for United when Sagnol launches a raking cross towards Elber on the six-yard line; Neville the man in the way. 12 Neville finds Beckham down near the corner flag; Beckham whips in a cross but van Nistelrooy cannot reach it. 14 Even Stevens so far, with more of the half-chances falling to Bayern. Veron playing well up, almost alongside Scholes. 17 Pixarro with a dangerous cross into a packed United area for Blanc to clear. 19 Blanc does a boo-boo on the edge of his own area when he tries to clear with his head but only succeeds in finding Hargreaves to his right. Hargreaves hesitates too long and United clear. 21 Corner to Bayern; Effenberg takes, comes to nothing. 23 Another corner to Bayern; Salihamidzic at the near post with a header that Blanc, on the goaline, guides behind. Second corner comes back out for Hargreaves to shoot from distance; fast and low, but too many legs in the way. 31 Barthez, Barthez, oh dear. Referee Frisk didn't like the way Barthez was holding on to the ball (well, he had hold of it for a good 15 seconds) and awards Bayern an indirect free-kick 16 yards out. Scholes pelts out as soon as the ball is touched and blocks the shot. Barthez off the hook for now. 35 Free-kick to United; Beckham, from out on the right, towards the far post for a head of indeterminate nationality to head just wide of said upright. 37 Irwin crosses from the left but Kovac gets to it first. 38 Bayern free-kick 35 yards out - fired in towards the six-yard box for Kuffour to head over. 40 Effenberg with another Bayern free-kick; decides to go for goal but the effort is blocked. 45 Free-kick to Bayern; Effenberg wafts it around the wall with Barthez left stranded as Salihamidizic just fails to make contact at the far post. Half-time. Sound half from United. Not much created but they've held firm and pushed up when they have had the chance. 46 Substitution Silvestre on for Irwin. Bayern get the second 45 underway. 48 Bayern floating a few long balls through for Barthez to kick clear, which provokes a flutter of nerves among the travelling United fans. 50 All Bayern so far as Salihamidzic tries to find Elber near the United touchline; Brown gets their first to shield for a goal-kick. 52 van Nistelrooy outnumbered on the edge of the Bayern area and is unable to turn and shoot after a short and sharp pass from Scholes. 54 Neville concedes a corner under pressure from Sergio; Effenberg takes and the ball comes out for Hargreaves to blast high and wide from 25 yards. 57 Good period of possession for United ends when Veron passes for Keane to shoot high from 30 yards even though he had three United players ahead of him. 60 United playing much higher up the field now as Veron and Scholes try to feed a succession of passes throgh to van Nistelrooy lurking on the edge of the area and Fortune out on the left. 64 Good work by Silvestre and Fortune on the left sends Beckham away but the but David's cross is straight at keeper Kahn. 67 Substitutions Jancker on for Elber, Sforza on for Effenberg. 69 Best chance for United this half; Fortune crosses for Beckham to head wide of the right-hand upright. 70 United nearly caught when Neville is burgled 25 yards out; only Jancker in the box for Lizarazu's cross however. 73 Substitution Zickler on for Salihamidzic. 74 GOAL: Bayern Munich 0 - 1 Man Utd Silvestre, away in space on the left as United charge up in numbers, crosses for van Nistelrooy to prod home with his left foot from all of five yards. Ferguson bounces up from the bench in rapture. 78 Corner to Bayern; Hargreaves takes, comes to nothing. 81 United look in no mood to now sit back and defend; they took their chance and now look happy to seek odut another. 84 Free-kick to Bayern just over 20 yards out on the right; Sagnol takes, Scholes heads clear. 85 Yorke on for van Nistelrooy. 86 Silvestre again the catalyst on the left; his cross goes behind Yorke but is retrieved by Beckham and laid back for Keane to rattle the crossbar from 25 yards. 87 GOAL: Bayern Munich 1 - 1 Man Utd Silvestre missed a through pass to Sergio on the edge of the area; Sergio accepts the offer to bring the scores level with a shoot across Barthez to the far post. 90 Booking Sergio. Two minutes to play. United free-kick 30 yards out; Beckham has a pop straight at Kahn. Hairy moments for United as Blanc is tugged down on the edge of the area and the ball ends up dribbling just wide of Barthez's right-hand post; corner comes to nothing. Full-time. A decent result could have been a great result for United but for the slip by Silvestre that allowed Sergio in for the equaliser."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
