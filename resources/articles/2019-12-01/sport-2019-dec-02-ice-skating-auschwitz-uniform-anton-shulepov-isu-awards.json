This year, Russia\u2019s Anton Shulepov has competed in the free skate program to the theme from Schindler\u2019s List, wearing a costume that uses elements of prisoner and guard uniforms from Auschwitz, where more than one million Jews, Poles, Roma and prisoners of war were killed by the Nazi regime during the second world war. Some skating fans had already raised concerns when Shulepov wore the costume in early November at the Internationaux de France event. However, the criticism stepped up when Shulepov was nominated for costume of the year. One user on Twitter said \u201cthe horrors of genocide [are] not entertainment.\u201d In a statement to the Guardian, Jonathan A Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, was also critical of the nomination. \u201cWhile we understand the need for skaters to be creative in their choice of costumes, Anton Shulepov\u2019s apparent decision to evoke painful Holocaust imagery as part of his routine was insensitive and offensive. We are surprised that the International Skating Union initially posted a picture of this costume as a nominee for \u2018costume of the year.\u2019 Yellow Stars of David or other concentration camp imagery have no place in figure skating.\u201d By Monday morning, Shulepov\u2019s nomination had been changed to his outfit for the short program \u2013 a plain blue costume that did not reference Auschwitz. The ISU said the nomination had been made in error. \u201cThe ISU regrets that by error the wrong costume (Free Skating instead of Short Program costume) of Mr Shulepov has been presented for voting,\u201d read a statement posted to the organisation\u2019s official Twitter account. \u201cThis error has been corrected and the ISU sincerely apologizes for this mistake and the bad sentiments it has caused.\u201d The Guardian has approached the ISU for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
