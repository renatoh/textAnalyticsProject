Allardyce severed ties with the Football Association on Tuesday by mutual consent after the 61-year-old was filmed making inappropriate comments to undercover reporters from the Daily Telegraph, including appearing to offer advice on how to circumvent the governing body\u2019s rules on player transfers. The FA, whose chairman Greg Clarke has indicated are intent upon appointing a manager with Premier League experience, are expected to explore the possibility of luring Ars\u00e8ne Wenger away from Arsenal, as they did in the summer, as they seek a long-term replacement. The Frenchman admitted he was flattered to be linked to the role on Wednesday night. \u201cBut my priority has always been this club,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil the end of this season I\u2019m here. And I am completely focused on that.\u201d Asked if his commitment extended only to the end of the season, he added: \u201cThat\u2019s not decided. My priority is always Arsenal Football Club and I have to assess how well I do until the end of the season.\u201d Gareth Southgate has stepped up from his position with the Under-21s to oversee the national side\u2019s remaining matches this year: next month\u2019s World Cup qualifiers against Malta and Slovenia, then the game against Scotland and the friendly against Spain in November. He will be assisted by Steve Holland, the Chelsea coach who had been working alongside Southgate with the juniors, with Sammy Lee and the goalkeeping coach, Martyn Margetson, retained on the senior staff. No decision has yet been made on the future of Craig Shakespeare, who had been combining his duties with those as No2 at Leicester City. Allardyce, who has left for a break abroad \u201cto chill out and reflect\u201d with his wife Lynn while the FA\u2019s governance and regulatory department scrutinises the transcripts of his comments to the Telegraph\u2019s reporters, spoke to reporters outside his home in Bolton on Wednesday and, while he acknowledged he had been foolish, suggested he had been the victim of entrapment. \u201cI think that, on reflection, it was a silly thing to do, but just to let everyone know I sort of helped out somebody I\u2019d known for 30 years [the agent Scott McGarvey, who had been at the meeting with the reporters posing as far east businessmen],\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, it was an error of judgment on my behalf and I\u2019ve paid the consequences. Entrapment has won on this occasion and I have to accept that. \u201cThe agreement was done very amicably with the FA. I apologise to all concerned in this unfortunate situation I\u2019ve put myself in.\u201d Asked if the England role would be his last in football, he added \u201clet\u2019s wait and see\u201d, though it is understood he is set upon resuming his club career in an attempt to redeem his reputation. The former Bolton, Blackburn, Newcastle, West Ham and Sunderland manager will consider any opportunities that open up for him over the course of this season. Southgate had warded off the possibility of being offered the senior position as an interim in the summer by making clear he had no interest in the post, and has since reiterated his belief that he lacks the experience to take on the role on a permanent basis. However, he recognised the urgent situation in which the FA found itself in accepting the post for the remainder of the calendar year. He described the job as \u201ca huge responsibility and a huge honour\u201d and will name his first squad on Sunday evening. That group will include Marcus Rashford, who scored a hat-trick for the under-21s against Norway this month. Wayne Rooney is expected to be retained as captain if he has recovered fully from the back injury which has rendered him doubtful for Manchester United\u2019s Europa League tie against Zorya Luhansk on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously been a difficult situation for the FA, but it was important that there was some stability and continuity for everybody,\u201d said Southgate, who has 57 caps. \u201cSo, from my point of view, it was important to step forward and give us the best possible chance to win these games. The fact that I know so many of the support team and the players already is really important, given the time that we have to prepare for these matches. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult circumstance for me, because we\u2019ve lost two senior coaches in the last few months who have both been very good to me, so that complicates my feelings. I certainly wish them both all the best for the future. But I\u2019m a passionate Englishman and I think people know where I stood on the long-term role in the summer. With my experience with the Under-21s in international football, and having worked with so many of the players who have moved up to the seniors as well, then I think we are in a good position to prepare for these games. \u201cThe focus now has to be on playing football, putting in good performances and getting results, starting with Malta at Wembley. These are four big games for us as a country, I\u2019m looking forward to the challenge and I\u2019m confident that we can get good results. We have an excellent group of players and the future is certainly bright for this England team.\u201d Southgate\u2019s Under-21s can qualify for next summer\u2019s European Championship if they win in Kazakhstan next week, with that game likely to be overseen by the Under-20s manager Aidy Boothroyd."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
