The Celtic striker Chris Sutton was also targeted but missed by a missile thrown from the crowd. Lothian and Borders Police detained a man who was later released due to a lack of evidence but Taylor insists the governing body will do all it can to root out those responsible for such incidents. \"That sort of crowd misbehaviour is something we need to look at very seriously indeed and the SFA will be looking at it. \"The clubs have the primary responsibility for the behaviour of their own crowds and match organisation but sometimes you can't stop idiots doing something like that. \"We need to support the courts in terms of sentencing and making sure all possible measures are taken by clubs so that the chances of this happening again are remote.\" The Bank of Scotland Premierleague chairman Lex Gold has also pledged his support. He said: \"It was a form of lunacy. Throwing coins like that could really damage someone badly; it could damage their eyesight. It's something that we need to stamp out. We have a very good record in terms of safety of players and it's one that we're very keen to protect. \"I would hope this isn't something that's going to become a problem. We agreed with Hearts and the SFA that the SFA will investigate the incident and they will form a judgment. \"We have a very good record and this is one incident but it's one that we have to follow up on and we're going to do that.\" The SFA is still waiting for a report from the match official Kenny Clark."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
