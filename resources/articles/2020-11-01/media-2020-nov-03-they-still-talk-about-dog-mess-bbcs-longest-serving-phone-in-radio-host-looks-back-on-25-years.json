Twenty-five years on, they still talk about dog mess. They talk about rubbish collections, the closure of public toilets on a popular beach, street lighting, pot holes \u2026 \u201d \u201cPutting Covid aside, it has always been the little things that impact people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Reed, 64, as he prepared to sit behind the microphone on his award-winning show for the last time. \u201cI can talk about Donald Trump, and maybe I get one or two callers. I talk about dog mess on the beach, and you get loads.\u201d On air five days a week, taking some 5,000 calls a year over 25 years, Reed has been a constant presence in Cornish homes; a combination of agony uncle, consumer affairs champion, counsellor, friend, and \u2013 crucially, he says \u2013 entertaining agent provocateur. After announcing his last show would be on Friday 6 November, the phones rang off the hook, with many in tears at news of his imminent departure. \u201cThey\u2019ve heard me talk about my children, my marriage, my divorce. They have lived and breathed my life, and I\u2019ve become part of their family,\u201d he said, admitting it was the hardest decision to hang up his headphones and take redundancy. The former mobile DJ began hosting the phone-in show five years after joining Radio Cornwall as a roving reporter, travelling his patch in his old Ford Escort with his huge, first generation mobile phone squeezed between two seats. Since then he has been uniquely placed to chart the temperature of Cornwall for decades. And, dog mess aside, has noted some major changes in his audience. \u201cMore recently, due to the presence of social media, we are appealing to a younger audience. They phone in about university stuff. They have been phoning in about Covid, and the perception that youngsters aren\u2019t taking it seriously and are spreading it. They come on, and they fiercely defend themselves. It\u2019s great. They are very politically astute, very switched on,\u201d said Reed. With social media also come the so-called \u201ckeyboard warriors\u201d. The shouty brigade, used to hammering out their opinions on Facebook and Twitter. His job has been to persuade them to go on air, then open up the phone lines to let other callers challenge the more crank, conspiracy theories they espouse. If they are too shouty, he said, \u201cthey know they will get short shrift.\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t censure anyone. They may have outlandish views, but what we\u2019ll do is get others to criticise that view. You get a wonderful tapestry of opinion, with four phone lines open at the same time.\u201d The internet means the programme\u2019s reach is now global. \u201cExpats, who\u2019ve left Cornwall for Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, New York \u2026 they all tune in. They are missing Cornwall, and it\u2019s their window to Cornwall.\u201d One memorable call was from a terrified musician from Cornwall, caught up in Hurricane Irma in 2017 on the Caribbean island of St Martin. \u201cThe hurricane was raging, there was no electricity, no power, people were going around looting. He was in tears, and he thought he was going to die. And his first thought was to phone me to try and help him get off the island. I kid you not, it was a powerful call.\u201d Reed had the local MP on the programme within minutes and 24 hours later the musician was rescued. He recently won a prestigious award for his mental health phone-ins. He recalls an incident in Penzance, a couple of years ago, when a woman who was a complete stranger, approached him. \u201cShe said: \u2018Thank you. You\u2019ve saved my life. I was suicidal, I listened to the programme and through that I got help.\u2019 Then she just walked away.\u201d \u201cIt made me realise that you have a responsibility, an absolute responsibility, to get it right. If we don\u2019t, the impact would be horrific.\u201d Some calls worry him so much, he feels compelled to contact the caller to check on them in a personal capacity after he has left the studio.\u201d Some radio stations believe phone-ins are \u201cold-fashioned\u201d, he said. He thinks it\u2019s \u201ca wonderful opportunity\u201d for the person on the street \u201cto quiz people in power\u201d. He\u2019s had every prime minister since Margaret Thatcher at the mercy of his callers. Looking back on 25 years, he feels \u201cexhausted\u201d. But he came close to dying from sepsis last year, is still trying to regain his strength, and feels this is the time to swap the studio for the gym, the tennis court, and the bike saddle. \u201cI\u2019ll be listening from somewhere. I will be pumping iron going \u2018what are they saying!!\u2019\u201d he said. So, will he call in himself? \u201cI am not so sure about that,\u201d he laughed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
