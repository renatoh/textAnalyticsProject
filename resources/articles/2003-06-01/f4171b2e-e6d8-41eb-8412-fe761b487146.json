First Eclipse was headed by Lady Sunset in inside the final furlong, but the former was rallied in good style by Balding's son-in-law Jason Edmunds to get back up on the line. However, having anxiously waited for the result of the photograph, Balding then had to endure an objection by the runner-up's rider, Fergal Lynch, who claimed that First Eclipse had \"bumped and unbalanced his horse about one out.\" However, the stewards were unimpressed by Lynch's opinion and, having decided that no interference had taken place, they concluded that there were no good and reasonable grounds for the objection and fined the jockey \u00a375. Balding, who gained his biggest success when Matty Tun won the \u00a350,000 Scottish Sprint Cup at the course last month, said: \"Jason rode a cracking race, First Eclipse is not an easy ride.\" Paul Hanagan was seen to good effect on Richard Fahey's Market Avenue who defied top weight in the Forth 2 Handicap and he heads south today hoping for a first success at Royal Ascot. \"I ride Cape Royal for Lynda Ramsden in the Balmoral Handicap, said Hanagan. \"Every race takes a lot of winning down there, but he is a very nice horse and there should be improvement in him.\" Ian Semple was on the mark with Lion's Domane, who landed the Gilbert Associates Claiming Stakes despite hanging badly left in the straight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
