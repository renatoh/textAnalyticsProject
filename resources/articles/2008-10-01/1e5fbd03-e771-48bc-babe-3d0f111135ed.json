Grandet's wealth is legendary and, inevitably, when Charles, his elegant, foppish nephew from Paris, turns up, Eug\u00e9nie, accustomed to her father's spartan frugality, is hopelessly smitten. But marriage is out of the question. Charles's father is bankrupt, so the young dandy must go to the West Indies to seek his fortune (Grandet offers to pay his fare as far as Nantes), and poor trusting Eug\u00e9nie vows to wait for him. A sombre cautionary tale read by Peter Joyce with apt darkness and dignity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
