In turn, smokers' risk of developing the disease is three times greater than those who avoid cigarettes. Age-related macula degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of partial blindness in the western world, and the risk of developing it normally rises after the age of 60. It is caused because of the degeneration and loss of photoreceptor cells in the retina at the back of the eye, particularly in the central, densely-packed, section used to pick out detail in a scene. The result of the disease is a blind spot in the centre of the field of view. John Yates, a medical geneticist from Cambridge University, was studying the genetic factors behind AMD when his team found the link with smoking. \"As well as looking at the genetic factors, we wanted to quantify the effects of smoking as accurately as we could,\" said Prof Yates. \"In collecting samples from patients we also asked about their smoking history and that's where this research has come from. Several studies in the past have just compared smokers with non-smokers to see if ever having smoked was a risk factor. What we've done is quantified the amount that people have smoked and it turns out that that is really what determines your risk.\" Looking at a group of 435 people that had AMD and 280 people who lived with them, Prof Yates's team found that the more a person smoked, the greater their chances of developing the eye disease. Smoking a packet of 20 cigarettes a day for more than 40 years tripled the risk of developing AMD compared with non-smokers. Passive smokers, defined as those who had lived with someone who smokes for five years or more, were found to double their risk. There was no difference between men and women. The researchers said that the mechanisms at work behind the increase in risk are related to oxidation damage of the cells at the back of the eye. \"Experimental evidence suggests that smoking impairs retinal pigment epithelium function (RPE), resulting in a build-up of waste products at the RPE/retinal interface,\" they say in a paper to be published in next month's issue of the British Journal of Ophthalmology. This build-up leads to damage to the membranes in the eyes, allowing the growth of new blood vessels. Additional damage may be also caused by the direct effect of nicotine in the tobacco."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
