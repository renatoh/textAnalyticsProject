He would never have fitted in with the old guard Unionists who treated the party, and the province, as if they were personal property to be handed down generation to generation. But he was a perfect fit with the new Unionism which emerged after the Stormont provincial government was swept into history by the introduction of direct rule from Westminster in 1972. The party, splintered and bloodied by factionalism, was rescued by veterans like James Molyneux and a younger generation - like current leader David Trimble - which recognised the need for internal change, as well as a new relationship with London. Maginnis slotted in nicely between the two, exuding stalwart conservatism but combining it with a shrewd political instinct. A bluff, genial and articulate man, he was often tipped as a potential party leader, and described as the Unionists' most gifted strategist. Never frightened of a scrap, either verbal or physical, he had occasional bruising rows with colleagues - and several brushes with death at the hands of would-be republican assassins. Maginnis's Unionism is informed by a passionate dislike for paramilitarism in general, and the republican sort in particular. A schoolmaster by training and manner, he joined the part-time Ulster Defence Regiment early in the Troubles; an experience which marked him deeply. One of his regimental colleagues was Cormac McCabe, a fellow teacher and a Roman Catholic. In 1974 he was dining in a County Tyrone hotel with his wife and physically handicapped daughter when IRA gunmen arrived, hauled him out and shot him dead. McCabe was just one of the \"decent, dependable\" fellows who served with Maginnis in the UDR, and paid for it with their lives. Their deaths are at the core of what the MP calls his \"deep, deep bitterness about the IRA\". Yet for all his visceral passion for law and order, Maginnis always saw that if Ulster was to have peace, it would have to made with republicans. With evident distaste but with characteristic doggedness, he became a leading supporter of the Good Friday process, denouncing what he saw as its flaws but insisting that it was the best hope on offer. He has been a tower of strength to party leader and first minister David Trimble, at a time when the party is threatened again with severe internal strains between the pragmatists and hardliners. (It was not always thus: in the mid 1980s, when all shades of Unionism were vehemently opposed to the Anglo-Irish agreement, he believed Trimble was flirting too closely with militant factions and said so, scathingly). There is no indication of disillusion in Maginnis's decision to step down. He is 62, in good health, and has hinted that he will not altogether retire from the public stage. But he is known to be exasperated with the slowness of the peace process, and with the constant carping attacks from the no-surrender brigade. His decision poses an electoral dilemma for all the big political parties in Northern Ireland. Maginnis has held the seat for 18 years; no mean feat in a constituency almost equally divided between Protestant and Catholic voters. Crucially, he achieved his majority of 13,688 in 1997 because the nationalist vote was split between the Social Democratic and Labour Party, and Sinn Fein. Maginnis, who is an immensely popular and hard working constituency MP, was the only mainstream unionist candidate. That could well change drastically, if the nationalist parties can put aside their differences to field a single candidate, and if Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists decide to challenge the traditional local suzerainty of the Ulster Unionists. There is also likely to be a bruising contest within Trimble's party for the nomination, between loyalists who support the official line on power-sharing and the rest of the peace accord, and the minority of hardliners who oppose it in its present form.
