This latest setback to the cash-strapped industry came as Ericsson of Sweden and Sony of Japan announced a mobile phone joint venture, to be based in Britain, with the aim of cutting losses and boosting market share. Launch of the world's first 3G network had been scheduled for the end of May but NTT DoCoMo has delayed the start date until the beginning of October, blaming technical problems. European operators could have benefited from the experience of a Japanese launch ahead of the rollout of their own next generation services - not least in gaining experience of the extent to which customers would be prepared to move to 3G and which services met the popularity test. Kurt Hellstr\u00f6m, the Ericsson chief executive, shrugged off the Japanese decision. \"It doesn't mean much in terms of sales and orders,\" he said in Stockholm. \"It is an introduction of a new technology and it is good to test it well before it is launched.\" Lauri Kivinen, chief executive at Nokia, was equally sanguine. \"We don't see any change in the 3G schedule on a global scale.\" Investors were more interested in the Ericsson/Sony joint venture, which saw Ericsson shares initially marked up 9%. Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications, based in London, will develop a range of devices from October to eventually replace the companies' own-brand handsets. Ericsson, the world's third-largest supplier of mobile phone handsets, is under pressure to bring the business back into profit. It has already announced heavy jobs cuts and is outsourcing manufacturing to a Singaporean firm, Flextronics, while retaining research and development and sales and marketing in-house. \"By combining the complementary strengths of Ericsson and Sony the new company is uniquely positioned to be a world leader in telecommunications as the industry moves rapidly towards mobile internet,\" Mr Hellstr\u00f6m said. Analysts remain concerned as to whether the combination of Ericsson and Sony will have the critical mass to make money in the face of tough conditions and Nokia's increasing dominance. Ericsson and Sony have about 11% of the global market, compared with Nokia's 32%. Meanwhile, Deutsche Telekom reported first-quarter losses o 400m euros, compared with a 500m euros profit in the same period last year. Heavy spending on new mobile licences and networks hit the results but performance should improve as the German mobile phone market moves closer to saturation, cutting customer acquisition costs and boosting revenues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
