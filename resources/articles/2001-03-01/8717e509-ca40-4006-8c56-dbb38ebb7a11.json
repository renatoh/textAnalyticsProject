In an editorial written by the paper's editor David Yelland in the wake of Wednesday's budget, the Sun declared on its front page that the election was in the bag for Labour, and Tony Blair would have the newspaper's support. Privately, senior Conservatives regard the loss of the Thatcherite flagship paper as inevitable and claim it was dictated for commercial reasons by the proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, over the heads of the paper's political staff. Some Tory MPs ruefully admitted that Mr Murdoch, not known for backing the losing side, had long ago decided that Labour would win the election at a canter. Trevor Kavanagh, the Sun's political editor, has for many months been dropping broad hints that his paper would be giving Labour a second chance. The move now raises the prospect that only the Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail of the national daily press will back William Hague. A central office official said the Sun's repeat of its 1997 defection, when it backed Labour in another front page endorsement at the start of the election campaign, was \"always coming\". He drew comfort from the fact that the paper was still being relatively complimentary about William Hague. \"They did not put the boot into William,\" he said. Officials also hoped that Mr Kavanagh, a fan of Lady Thatcher, will still be free to express his opinions. But Tories were angry that the Sun had earlier attacked William Hague's speech at the party's spring conference in Harrogate, when he warned Britain would look like a foreign land after four years of a second Labour term. Mr Hague's speech called for tough action against asylum seekers, including detention camps for all applicants, and it might have been tailor made for the white van man, the Sun's latest version of Essex man. Instead the Sun attacked the speech on the grounds that it could be misconstrued as racist and anti-foreign. \"It flirted with extremism and left a nasty taste in the mouth\", said the paper. Deploying some of the pioneer spirit of early America, the Sun argued that Britain needed more immigrants to boost the workforce. The same point has been made by the government in a series of speeches by Barbara Roche, the immigration minister. Adopting a policy that left central office in a state of puzzled despair, the Sun argued in an editorial the day before it finally endorsed Labour: \"If these immigrants are just here for the benefits they should be sent home. But if they want to work, they should be allowed to stay.\" Mr Kavanagh in a signed article urged the Conservatives to adopt a bold policy of \"barring new arrivals from all forms of welfare for a year until they prove they are genuinely looking for work\". Pressed on the Sun's attitude decision yesterday Mr Portillo said: \"I thought the Harrogate speech was a very good speech and a speech in normal times that talked about the dangers of the euro would have been a speech that the Sun would have applauded because the sentiments expressed were so much in line with the policy of the Sun.\" Tories argued their approach to asylum was much closer to the views of the Sun readership than Labour. There has been a long academic debate about the extent to which newspapers can influence the voting habits of their reader, although many. believe the influence of newspapers has been diluted by the dominance of TV during elections. The Sun's influence can be exaggerated. In 1979 a third of the Sun readership on the weekend after the election thought the paper had backed Labour when it had in fact supported the Tories. The Sun nevertheless claimed that \"it was the Sun wot won it\" for John Major in 1992, after front page attacks such as \"Will the last person to leave Britain turn out the lights?\" on polling day ridiculed Labour's competence. The then Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, came to believe that the tabloids killed off his chances. Equally the defection to Labour in 1997, carefully prepared by Alastair Campbell and Tony Blair, was seen as decisive by the Sun and significant within Downing Street. Bob Worcester, chairman of opinion pollsters Mori, argues the Sun's readership's politics precisely reflects that of the British public. A Mori poll in January showed Sun readers as 50% Labour supporters, 33% Conservative and 12% Liberal Democrat. The same poll nationally showed Labour on 50%, Conservatives on 31% and Liberal Democrats 14%. Mr Worcester argues that with about 20% of the electorate determinining the outcome of each election, the Sun can have an important influence. He said: \"The Sun newspaper represents 17% or 18% of the electorate, and if they move just 1% of the marginal voters, it's the same as if they are moving 5% of the total electorate.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
