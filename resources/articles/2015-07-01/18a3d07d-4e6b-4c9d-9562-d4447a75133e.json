Finkel (played by Hill) is shown getting fired for inventing parts of a story about the modern slave trade in Africa. The scandal makes him pretty well unemployable. Then he finds that a mass killer called Christian Longo (Franco) had taken his name and identity while on the run in Mexico, where he was finally arrested. Intrigued \u2013 and clearly seeing a career-resurrection, although that obvious reality is downplayed in this solemn drama \u2013 Finkel visits Longo while in prison, and develops a relationship with him. The significance of Longo using Finkel\u2019s name is overplayed, the supposed bond between the two men is dramatically inert and the idea that Finkel has reached some kind of redemptive self-knowledge in realising how he has been manipulated is unconvincing. Rupert Goold, the brilliant stage director who did great work on the BBC\u2019s Hollow Crown Shakespeare miniseries, is not well served by this material."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
