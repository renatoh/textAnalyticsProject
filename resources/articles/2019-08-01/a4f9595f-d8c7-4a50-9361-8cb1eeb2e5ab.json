In a report on the likely lead-up to the UK\u2019s departure, the Institute for Government said that MPs merely expressing opposition to no deal would not necessarily be sufficient and that there were limited parliamentary manoeuvres open to them to force the issue. With the exit date now less than 12 weeks away, should the government reach a new accord with the EU there would only be a slim parliamentary window in which to pass the necessary legislation. Even bringing down the government would be unlikely to see an election take place in time. \u201cMPs looking to force the government into a change of approach face a huge challenge when parliament returns,\u201d said Joe Owen, the Brexit programme director for the institute. \u201cEven if they can assemble a majority for something, they may find few opportunities to make their move \u2013 and time is running out.\u201d The thinktank\u2019s report \u2013 titled Voting on Brexit: Parliament\u2019s Role before 31 October \u2013 noted that more than three years on from the referendum, the UK\u2019s options remained the same: leaving with a deal; leaving without a deal; seeking an extension; or revoking article 50. But while no-deal Brexit would happen by default, and the government has said it does not need to pass any more primary legislation before 31 October for it to happen, a new deal would require Boris Johnson\u2019s government to seal this with the EU over the summer and begin parliamentary work after the Commons recess in September. Even if this happens \u2013 and Johnson is currently declining any new talks with the EU without a commitment from Brussels to ditch the Irish backstop border insurance policy \u2013 the current Commons schedule would leave just 22 sitting days to pass the new withdrawal deal. The report said that while a majority of MPs appeared to oppose no deal, they would \u201cneed new tactics\u201d to actually block it, given the lack of Brexit-related legislation on to which to tack amendments or new motions, unlike when Theresa May was seeking to pass her deal. Simply passing motions opposing no deal would not be enough, the report argued, as Johnson\u2019s government has indicated it will not be bound by these. Amending primary legislation would carry more weight, but this would depend on bills being brought to the Commons, which might not happen. Even what the report called the \u201cnuclear option\u201d of a no-confidence vote against Johnson\u2019s government might not block no deal, the report said, as Johnson could sit out the 14-day period dictated if he lost such a vote, even if a new government seemed viable. The report said that if an election was called, given a five-week campaign period and a possible week needed to finish parliamentary business before dissolution, it would be very tight to arrange before 31 October. Such a timetable \u201cwould raise big questions for the civil service\u201d, the report added. \u201cAlthough it could continue to prepare for no deal, as it would be seen as being \u2018in the national interest\u2019, it would be restricted in how it communicated about it. It would also make it a more challenging choice for businesses considering investing in no-deal preparations as they may want to await the outcome of the election.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
