Thus it proved to be last week, as far as the Gladiator was concerned. His judgment and timing were nothing short of contemptible and the troop sniggered with derision at his self-inflicted plight. The market, for a brief period, looked as though it would react positively to Colin Powell's UN address. Shortly afterwards it became apparent that there was insufficient irrefutable evidence to convince the world to proceed with immediate military action against Iraq. The Gladiator took the opportunity of closing out his 'upbets' on three severely thrashed Nasdaq stocks. Lucent Technology bought at $1.95 in \u00a325 per point, Norfolk Southern bought at $19.50 and Oracle at $11.75, both in \u00a310 per point, were all sold on Wednesday morning at $1.67, $19.87 and $11.90 respectively - an overall loss of \u00a330. The troop was arrogant enough to think that a good result had been achieved and that the Dow would inevitably fall during the rest of week. By Thursday evening it had not done so. So the troop took its punishment on the chin, when buying the Dow back at 7978, having sold it last Friday at 7900, a loss of \u00a3780 - arrogantly unnecessary proportions. The Gladiator needed to restore his tarnished reputation. It's Friday - the US employment data was good. No one believes a word of it. However, banks have been severely hammered in recent weeks. The 'bank reporting season' starts next week. Lloyds TSB and Barclays may announce huge provisions for bad debts and pension shortfalls. That news could already have been discounted, so the troop strode into the ring and bought both stocks at 395p and 350p in \u00a325 per point. Morgan Stanley was also purchased at $36.65 in \u00a310 per point to balance the portfolio up. Gold saw some heady heights last week but went into reverse on Thursday. The opportunity was not lost on the Gladiator, who bought Asa Inc at $40.65 in \u00a310 per point. \u00b7 The Gladiator is the nom de plume of a professional spreadbetter"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
