But during his first visit to his family in Wembley in two years, Zed is struck down by a degenerative disease, which robs him of virtually everything but his voice. First-time feature director Bassam Tariq, who co-wrote the screenplay with Ahmed, inventively uses Zed\u2019s illness as a jumping-off point to explore cultural identity, family and the long shadow cast by Partition. This is abrasive, confrontational film-making, with a machine-gun assault of ideas and influences. Spoken-word poetry jostles against the writing on Partition of Pakistani essayist Saadat Hasan Manto; painful family history blurs with hallucinatory memories from Zed\u2019s childhood. And Ahmed, himself a rapper, makes sure that every line lands like a punch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
