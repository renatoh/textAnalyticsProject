He says an election is only considered \"free and fair\" when the winning party leans in the direction of Washington or Brussels. This claim is somewhat undercut by the fact that the OSCE's initial findings are published immediately after polling day, sometimes before the winning party or coalition has become clear. Moreover, the OSCE's reports are scrupulously confined to the election process, never commenting on or legitimising the result. But leaving inconvenient facts aside, his insinuation that the reports are tailored to serve one capital or the other is a slur on the dedicated work of thousands of monitors, several hundred of whom have spent much of the last few weeks methodically observing elections in Belarus and/or Ukraine. The OSCE preliminary findings report on Belarus has been available for over a week and speaks for itself www.osce.org As for Ukraine, Sunday's parliamentary election, which is widely expected to have produced a Moscow-orientated government, has just been adjudged by the OSCE (reporting on Monday) to have \"consolidated democracy\". To quote the American head of the observation team: \"These elections can only be described as free and fair, and so it is the Ukrainian people who are the real winners.\" That doesn't quite seem to fit in with Mr Clark's neat conspiracy theory.
