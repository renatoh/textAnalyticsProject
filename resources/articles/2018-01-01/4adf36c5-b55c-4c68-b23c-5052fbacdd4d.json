To the tune of Power by the British girl band Little Mix, each of these \u201chostesses\u201d \u2013 clad in a short, tight black skirt and high heels \u2013 made their way to one of 24 tables, where about 360 men had squeezed into their tuxedos and were awaiting the arrival of dinner. On the menu that night was Scottish smoked salmon, 34-day-aged Angus beef fillet and a variation on a black forest g\u00e2teau, all of which was followed by some groping, lewd comments and requests for the women to join diners in their hotel bedrooms. Welcome to the Presidents Club charity dinner \u2013 an event that has raised more than \u00a320m during its 33-year history but has largely been a closely guarded affair. At least it was until this year\u2019s event, where two of the hostesses happened to be undercover reporters from the Financial Times. Among the clutch of bankers, property tycoons, entrepreneurs and celebrities, the journalists reported being sexually harassed themselves and witnessing much, much more \u2013 although the small number of attendees who are willing to talk publicly expressed their surprise at the reports. Still, somebody did see much of this coming. The brochure for the dinner warned male guests against \u201charassment and unwanted conduct\u201d, while upon arrival the hostesses were handed a five-page non-disclosure agreement to sign, although according to the FT reporters they were not given a chance to read its contents or take a copy with them after signing. Caroline Dandridge, the founder of the Artista agency that provided the hostesses for the evening, also gave a few clues during her pre-dinner pep talk about what her employees could expect. Dandridge told her staff that the men might try to get the women \u201cpissed\u201d, and just before they were sent out into the ballroom they were told that if any of the guests became \u201ctoo annoying\u201d the hostesses should alert the boss. Or, to put it in the words of one of the guests: \u201cDown that glass, rip off your knickers and dance on that table.\u201d The evening was hosted by the television personality and author David Walliams for the third year running, with the auction hosted by Jonny Gould, presenter of Channel Five\u2019s baseball coverage from 1997-2008 and a near ubiquitous presence at London charity fundraising dinners. \u201cWelcome to the most un-PC event of the year,\u201d Gould bellowed. The lots included a night at the Windmill strip club in Soho, which is facing closure over \u201cserious breaches\u201d of its licensing conditions after concerns the dancers regularly broke the no-touching rules. There was also a course of plastic surgery, along with the tagline \u201cAdd spice to your wife.\u201d One 19-year-old hostess recounted to the FT a conversation with a guest nearing his 70s, who asked her if she was a prostitute. She was not. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this before, and I\u2019m never doing it again,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking scary.\u201d Aside from the men, also on the hostesses\u2019 backs that evening was the Artista \u201cenforcement team\u201d, which consists of suited men and women circling the ballroom and cajoling less willing hostesses to interact with the diners. Outside the women\u2019s toilets a monitoring system was in place to ensure that the young women didn\u2019t spend too long away from the tables. A security guard at the door was on hand, keeping time. It was claimed the women were paid \u00a3175 \u2013 plus a taxi home \u2013 for a six-hour shift, although that did not include any time spent at the event\u2019s after-party. Dandridge told the FT: \u201cThis is a really important charity fundraising event that has been running for 33 years and raises huge amounts of money for disadvantaged and underprivileged children\u2019s charities. There is a code of conduct that we follow. I am not aware of any reports of sexual harassment and with the calibre of guest, I would be astonished.\u201d The Dorchester told the FT that it had a zero-tolerance policy regarding harassment of guests or employees. \u201cWe are unaware of any allegations and should we be contacted we will work with the relevant authorities as necessary,\u201d it said. Before it announced this year\u2019s event was to be the last, the Presidents Club said: \u201cThe organisers are appalled by the allegations of bad behaviour at the event asserted by the Financial Times reporters. Such behaviour is totally unacceptable. The allegations will be investigated fully and promptly and appropriate action taken.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
