This could change at the weekend if results go their way [They didn't \u2013 Knowledge Ed]. Can any other team top this?\" Before we look into this, here's Malcolm Warburton with some important clarifications: \"Rochdale won the Lancashire Combination in 1910-11 and 1911-12. On the first occasion they finished seven points ahead of reserve teams from Everton, Bolton Wanderers, Liverpool and Blackburn Rovers, but these all left, together with nine other reserve teams, to become founder members of the Central League. The second time they won by six points from St Helens Recreation before themselves joining the Central League, which at that time was a sort of Greg Dyke-style mixture of reserve and first teams. But when Third Division North was founded in 1921 all the first team members became founder members of that division. In 1913 St Helens Rec switched from association football to rugby league, performing creditably until folding in 1939. \"Rochdale have also won the Lancashire Senior Cup on three occasions (1949, 1971 and 2005), although that is a reserve team competition.\" Glad that's clear. Other than that, there are no teams currently in the Football League who have never won anything, even if it is \"just\" a Division Three here or an FA Trophy there. Shrewsbury haven't won much but do have a long and curious record in the Welsh Cup, despite being, as the geography scholars among you may have noticed, not in Wales. Indeed, that particular pot has been lifted 21 times by English clubs, until they were cruelly booted out in 1995. In terms of clubs now in the top flight, Hull have the longest drought, having left the trophy polish alone since winning the 1966 Third Division, and while Newcastle's recent fan protest centred around them not lifting a thing since 1969, they at least have second tier wins in 1993 and 2010, and of course the 2006 Intertoto Cup, to dry their eyes on. Can you suggest a team who has gone for longer without winning anything? THE GAPS BETWEEN GONGS \"With the sad passing of Sandy Jardine recently, a show on BBC radio noted how Sandy won the Scottish Football Writers Player of the Year award in Scotland in 1974-75 and 1985-86 - a gap of 11 years,\" writes Paul Dixon. \"I remembered that you recently did a listing with Team of the Year nominees, but I didn't see that any of those players won an individual award with such a large time gap. Can anyone top Sandy's achievement?\" Yes indeed Paul, and it's a relatively obvious candidate. Stanley Matthews won the inaugural Football Writers' Player of the Year award in 1948, and was voted top again in 1963, 15 years later. Given Sir Stan was playing in the Second Division that year and was on the verge of retirement, there was more than a whiff of sentiment about that one, mind. There hasn't been a particularly big gap between PFA player awards, although Ryan Giggs had to wait 17 years after being voted their Young Player of the Year in 1992 before he won the 'grown-up' crown, in 2009. Meanwhile, Tom Aldous has a nomination from a little further afield: \"In response to the question about Sandy Jardine and longest gaps between winning a player of the year award there was also an 11-year gap between Enzo Francescoli's 2 South American player of the year awards.\" SPECIALISTS IN FAILU... COMING SECOND \"I noticed the other day that Graham Taylor has a history of finishing runner-up,\" begins Jeremy Orbell. \"He's done it in the top three divisions with Watford and top two divisions with Aston Villa. While he did manage two fourth tier championships in three years in the 70s he lost out again in the FA Cup Final in 1984. A couple of questions spring to mind: Has anyone come as close to winning all four divisions and can anyone better the list for coming second in domestic and European competition? Avram Grant had a good stab with Chelsea in 2008 if I recall.\" Tim is straight in with a few suggestions: \"Claudio Ranieri deserves a mention. He has finished second in the Premier League with Chelsea in 2003-4, second in Serie A with Juventus in 2008-9 and Roma in 2009-10, and this season he will complete his hat-trick by finishing second in Ligue 1 with Monaco. On top of that, he lost the final of the FA Cup with Chelsea in 2002 and the Coppa Italia with Roma in 2010. All of those came at the hands of just three managers: Wenger, Mourinho, and Blanc. \"Klaus Toppm\u00f6ller didn't finish top of anything with Bayer Leverkusen in 2002, when they blew the league to finish second and were the runners-up in both the cup and Champions League. Jupp Heynckes repeated the Treble in 2011-2 when Bayern were runners-up in the same three competitions. \"J\u00fcrgen Klopp also deserves a mention. Dortmund were runners-up in the Bundesliga, DFB Pokal and Champions League last season, and this season they could well finish up as the runners-up of both the Bundesliga and DFB Pokal. Being the runner-up five times in two seasons has to hurt...\" An excellent list. It's worth adding Jorge Jesus to that as well, who rather heartbreakingly led Benfica to three runners-up spots last season. They were top of the league until the penultimate weekend of the season but lost the key game to Porto with a stoppage time goal, they were winning the Portuguese Cup final until the 79th minute before Vitoria de Guimaraes scored twice, and of course lost the Europa League final to Chelsea, a Branislav Ivanovic header in the 91st minute sealing their fate there. Oh, and they lost on penalties in the semi-final of the Portuguese League Cup. Luckily, with the league and the league cup already in the bag, and the finals of the Europa League and the cup to come, not to mention making Tim Sherwood very cross, Jesus will redeem himself this season. DRAWTASTIC (2) \"Following the topic of teams drawing more than winning and still succeeding, Internazionale went the whole 2004-05 season only racking up two defeats, but could only manage third in the league,\" wrote James Tennant last week. \"Has any team ever lost fewer games but still finished lower than third in a season?\" As usual with any question about football, attention turns to Sri Lanka, where in the 1998-99 Bristol League (no idea), Jupiter SC managed the impressive feat of going the whole season unbeaten. However, remarkably their record of 11 wins and eight draws was only enough to finish fifth, and therefore miss out on the end of season playoffs. Also, in San Marino in 1989-90, Tre Fiore went unbeaten throughout the season and the rather complex double-elimination playoffs systems, and ended up ranked fourth. Their regular season record of seven wins and 11 draws put them second in the table, they drew both their playoff games and lost them on penalties. BAD DEFENCE, GOOD TEAM Last week Steffan John pondered: \"This season, Rayo Vallecano have conceded more goals than any other team in La Liga, yet they're in the top 10. Is this the highest that a team with the league's worst defensive record has achieved?\" The Knowledge yields the floor to Mr Bart van Hoof. Take it away, Bart: \"Well ... funny enough but in the 2001-2002 season in both the Primera Divisi\u00f3n and Segunda Divisi\u00f3n in Spain the team with the worst defence finished in ninth place. Those teams were Athletic de Bilbao with 66 goals against and a +/- of -12, and Racing de Ferrol, in the 22 team second division, with 60 goals against and a +/- of -2.\" Bart then offered a whole raft of other numbers that we frankly didn't understand. Sorry Bart. This worst defence/top half combo has never occurred in the Premier League era, although in 1992-93 Norwich came third having conceded 65 in 42 games, the fourth-worst record in the division, while Tottenham finished eighth with the third-worst. Indeed, the last example of this occurring in the English top flight was in 1955-56, when Sunderland came ninth having let in 95 goals, the worst record in the division. Before that, Manchester City finished 11th (in a 22-team division) while conceding 71 in 1923-24, sixth-place Aston Villa had the joint-worst defensive record in 1911-12 and Wolves came eighth in 1903-04 having let in 66. Can anyone beat that? PLAYERS EATING MID-MATCH (3) Last week we reported the story of Neil Tolson eating a Mars Bar mid-match while playing for Hyde United but couldn't nail it down as truth. Now we can. The Knowledge got in touch with the man himself, and he confirmed that he did indeed enjoy a little nougat and soft caramel smothered in milk chocolate. \"It's true, away at Fleetwood,\" he said. \"I had one in my hand when I scored.\" KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \"Seeing Newcastle's moustachioed-til-they-win quartet reminded me of Romania's bleached-hair World Cup 1998 squad,\" mused Simon Thomas back in 2010. \"Are there any other instances of players opting for an appearance style en masse?\" There are indeed, Simon, although our first example contains two conspicuous absentees from trips to the barber shop for very different, but equally sensible reasons. \"At the close of the 2000-01 season, all of Leeds United's squad decided to participate in a mass head-shaving,\" writes Andy Brook. \"The notable exceptions were Ian Harte, who was getting married the following weekend, and Lee Bowyer, who was maintaining a respectable appearance due to a certain infamous 'out-of-stadium' appearance \u2026 at Hull crown court.\" Kjetil Njoten writes in with the story of SK Brann, who \"scraped through the first round of the cup against amateur side Voss in 1988. Norwegian journalist Davy Wathne said in a scathing match report he would walk from Bergen to Oslo, 600 miles away, if Brann made it down to the last two. In response to the had-to-be-read-to-be-believed slaughtering he handed out to the shambolic side, the team vowed en masse not to shave until they got knocked out of the cup. Fast forward five months and the hairiest first XI since the viking era lost 2-0 to Rosenborg in a replay. In a heart-warming gesture Davy Wathne proved as good as his word and did indeed walk to the game, raising over \u00a3100,000 for a cancer charity.\" For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive. Can you help? \"Southampton's pitch at the weekend was a sight to behold,\" reckons Lee Anderson. \"Are there any other examples of inventive grass-pattern designs?\" \"Following on from your 3 October 2007 piece on footballing twins,\" asks Sam Holden. \"I notice that the Bulgarian national football team often features two pairs of twins; Georgi and Iliya Milanov, and Veselin and Yordan Minev. Are there other examples of two or more pairs of twins playing in the same team, or representing the same national team?\" \"Divided equally amongst the population of Wales, Gareth Bale's \u20ac100m transfer few would net his countrymen and women a tidy \u20ac32.64 (\u00a326.77 at time of writing) each\" tots up Nick Read. \"Has there ever been a transfer that would prove more financially beneficial to the individual inhabitants of the transferee's home country?\" \"I have a question!\" exclaims Edward Brown. \"With Norwich needing a mighty 17 goal swing to avoid relegation in their final game (and results to go their way, of course), what has been the greatest escape by a club on the last day of the season thanks to a reverse of their goal difference? Surely no team has overcome anything more than a 5 goal deficit on the final day to send another team down?\" \"Liverpool looked likely to pull off an extraordinary feat until two weeks ago \u2013 winning the Premier League despite being fifth favourites at the start of the season,\" writes Paul Trotter. \"When was the last time a team regarded as such outsiders won the Premier League (or Division One) title? My guess is that the champions have come from the two or three favourites for at least 30 years \u2013 perhaps Aston Villa or Everton in the early 1980s were the last outsiders the win the league?\" Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
