In the run-up to the first Gulf war Saddam Hussein was preventing several British families from leaving Iraq. Heath flew to Baghdad, where he had a few firm words to say to the dictator, and, as a result, all the British people who wanted to leave were on the next plane home with him. This seemed, to me, at the time a pretty impressive achievement, but the entire episode now seems to slipped from the collective memory. Melissa Meek Castle Cary, Somerset It is clear that Ted Heath left a mixed legacy. However, your correspondents failed to do full justice to his strong stand against racial intolerance. In particular, his sacking of Enoch Powell from the Tory frontbench following the \"rivers of blood\" speech, for which Heath should be rightly remembered.
