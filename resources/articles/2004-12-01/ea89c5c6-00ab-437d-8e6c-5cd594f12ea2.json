The Castellon region is the smallest of Valencia's three provinces after Valencia and Alicante, and tourism is relatively undeveloped compared with the other costas. 'People now have to fly to Valencia or Barcelona, and hopefully it will encourage more British tour operators to feature this area as very few do at present,' said a spokeswoman for the tourist board. When the airport opens in 2006 tourism is likely to increase dramatically, especially in the least developed areas of the Costa del Azahar, or Orange Blossom Coast, which has quiet resorts, including Peniscola with its walled old town and classical music concerts throughout the summer, and in the mountainous interior where the unspoilt landscapes of the sierras offer great walking and canoeing. The medieval town of Morella in the Maestrazgo mountains, a 14th-century walled town with narrow lanes, is one of the most significant attractions and visitors will be able to stay in the oldest castle, the Cloister of St Francis, that is being converted into a Parador. There are many rural hotels in the area, such as El Jardin Vertical (00 34 964 329938) in the village of Vilafames, a few kilometres north of Castellon, doubles from \u20ac90 (\u00a360) a night.
