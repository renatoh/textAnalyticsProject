The city was much more liberal in those days. It was not mandatory for women to cover their heads and educated women often went without a scarf. My father worked as a civil servant and I attended the best school in Kabul. When the revolution took place in 1976, I didn't pay much attention to it; most of the fighting was in remote areas. All I wanted was to continue my studies and to avoid being called up to fight for the Soviet-backed government at all costs. I completed my studies at 17 - too young for the army - and secured a place instead at university to study medicine. I was lucky: some of my friends had to go into military service and lost out on their education. Some lost their lives in the war against the mujahideen. When the Soviets left in 1989, the situation in Kabul worsened. Mujahideen targeted the city and started firing missiles. By the time I qualified and got a job at a big teaching hospital in 1992, the fighting had intensified. Sometimes it was too dangerous to go to work; there were so many checkpoints to pass through. I had married by this time; I met my wife at a party and fell in love with her very quickly. But as the capital became more and more dangerous my family fled to Ghazni province in eastern Afghanistan, where we thought we would be safer. I got a job as a doctor in a clinic, and when the whole country came under Taliban control in 1996 I grew a beard and wore long robes in accordance with Taliban rules. But it was difficult to practise medicine properly. I wasn't allowed to examine women and had to make a diagnosis just by talking to them, or by asking a nurse to conduct the examination in another room while I called out instructions. My wife and I longed to have children but the situation was so unstable that we didn't feel it was a good time to bring a child into the world. Education was important to both of us, and we didn't want our child, especially a girl, not to be able to go to school. Although I opposed the Taliban, I stuck by the oath doctors make to deliver healthcare to everyone. When I visited sick patients in their homes we sometimes talked about the regime. The people I visited often lived in desperate poverty without electricity or enough to eat. With patients I trusted, I gave views about the regime and with those I didn't trust, I remained silent. I still don't know which one of those I trusted betrayed me. But one day Taliban officials came to the clinic and arrested me. I was held in prison for 11 days and was beaten on my back, feet and face with guns and lengths of cable. I had said my usual goodbyes to my wife and family that morning when I left for work, assuming I would see them at the end of the day. In fact, it was the last I saw of them, and it would be more than 16 months before I saw daylight sky. I probably would have died in that prison - as many others did before and after me - but my father paid a substantial bribe to a local Taliban commander. In the middle of the night, a guard opened the door for me, while another took me out of prison into a waiting van. I had been praying that my family would find a way to rescue me and when my cell door opened I knew I had been given a second chance at life. The van driver took me to my uncle's house. I knew I had to get out of the country fast, and my journey began a few hours later when a lorry arrived to take me over the border to Pakistan. The lorry was carrying potatoes, cereals, kidney beans and apples, and I was hidden in a small compartment behind the driver's cabin. My heart began to beat fast when Taliban officials peered in at the border to ask the driver if he was carrying anything he shouldn't be. He shook his head and invited them to check. Thankfully, they declined. When we finally arrived across the border in Peshawar, I laid low and waited for the next part of my journey to begin. Once you embark on such a journey, there is no way back. You have no money, no passport, no visa; the only choice is to keep moving in the direction the smuggler leads you. I and my fellow asylum seekers were locked into houses during the day with the curtains tightly closed, and were fed the same monotonous diet of soup, bread, butter and biscuits whichever country we passed through. Sometimes we travelled on foot through forests, sometimes in cars or lorries, but we only ever travelled in darkness. Everywhere looked more or less the same to me. At each stage we were passed to another smuggler. They barely spoke to us; we were human parcels on a long production line. They gave the orders, and we obeyed. I didn't mind which country I arrived in. All that mattered was being safe and free. Sometimes, though, the journey was so hard that I wanted to give up. The physical hardship was immense, but the hardest thing to deal with was the grief - for the loss of my country, my wife, my family, my profession. I yearned for peace in Afghanistan, so I would be able to go home. It was impossible to make contact with my loved ones; they didn't know whether I was dead or alive. One day, the smugglers looking after us said, \"We're going to send you somewhere by lorry. Wherever it stops, claim asylum.\" At one point I heard a harsh sound - so loud that I had to put my hands over my ears - and realised we were in a tunnel. When the lorry stopped, the driver opened the doors and looked shocked to find us crouching there. We had been told to say nothing and cowered silently. I was dazzled by the sight of the sky. I had lost all sense of time while we travelled but I soon discovered it was August 2002. I spoke good English, and assumed from the language the police were speaking that I had arrived in Britain. I was taken to an organisation called Refugee Action and told how to claim asylum. I was so happy to be safe at last and certain that, after the torture I had experienced, I would be given refuge in the UK. I phoned a friend in Peshawar who travelled regularly to Ghazni and asked him to let my family know I was safe. I was shocked when, a few weeks later, my claim was refused. I was completely out of touch with the world on my journey and did not know that September 11 had happened. Home Office officials told me that after the attack on the twin towers Afghanistan had been invaded and the Taliban defeated; it would be safe for me to go home. When I asked my family, through the friend in Peshawar, if it was indeed safe, the message came back, \"A million per cent no.\" The Taliban still control parts of Afghanistan and know who their enemies are. I lodged a fresh claim as soon as possible. Had I not had friends to support me I would have had to do what other destitute asylum seekers do, living a shadowy life underground and taking a job on the black market. Instead, I spent my days in libraries studying for the exams I needed to pass in order to be able to practise medicine in the UK. When I found out earlier this year that my fresh claim for asylum had succeeded, I felt incredible joy. I was safe at last. I was given leave to remain and a work permit so I will be able to work again as a doctor and make a contribution to society. The chains of anxiety and stress locked around my brain fell away. But my joy was full of sadness, too, because my wife and family were not here with me. Every day I yearn to see them again. In more than five years my only communication with my wife has been brief messages - saying we love and miss each other - sent through the friend in Peshawar. Now I'm applying for lots of jobs as a doctor all over the UK. I hope that as soon as I find work I will get permission for my wife to join me. We long to be reunited and to fulfil our dream of having children at last. There are many things I miss about my country, most of all my family and friends, but also our traditions and the eight or nine months a year of sunshine. I have seen a lot of British hospitality in the past four years and have met many people who devote themselves to helping others. I feel I belong here in the same way as other citizens. This country has taught me the meaning of freedom and human rights, particularly for women. But half my heart is still in Afghanistan. I know there are others tortured and threatened with death, as I was, and I hope they too will get justice and the same opportunity to experience freedom as I have had. \u00b7 As told to Diane Taylor"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
