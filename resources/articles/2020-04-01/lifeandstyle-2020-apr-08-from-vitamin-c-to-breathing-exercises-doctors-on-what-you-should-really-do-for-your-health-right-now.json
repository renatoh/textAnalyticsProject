UK doctors on how to protect against coronavirus \u2013 and manage symptoms", "bodyText": "You will already be regularly washing your hands and social distancing, but many of us are still likely to become infected with coronavirus. Doing what you can now to improve your health and boost your immune system will help your body cope. Thankfully, the majority of cases are mild and you should recover within a week, though if your symptoms are persistent it is vital to seek medical advice from NHS 111 rather than try to continue to manage at home. With that in mind, here\u2019s what you can do to put yourself in the best position to help your recovery. Protect your lungs Tom Wingfield, a physician and clinical lecturer in infectious diseases at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, says you should avoid anything that damages your lungs \u2013 stop smoking, and don\u2019t expose others to secondhand smoke. \u201cOpen fires are not great, and if you have allergies that irritate your lungs, avoid what you can.\u201d One upside of the lockdown is that air pollution has decreased. And, says Wingfield, \u201c[general aerobic] exercise will help your lungs\u201d. Boost your immune system There is no magic supplement. The advice is as it\u2019s always been: reduce your alcohol consumption, exercise, sleep well and reduce stress. A varied, balanced diet, with lots of vegetables and fruit, is important, but there is little evidence for most vitamin and mineral supplements. Getting out in the sun each day can also be beneficial, says the GP Amir Khan. \u201cThe majority of people have low vitamin D because we don\u2019t have enough sunlight in the UK, and we are coming out of winter. Vitamin D levels will be depleted, so there\u2019s no harm in taking a vitamin D tablet.\u201d Rest as soon as you start to notice symptoms Many people who are suspected of having had the virus report at least one day of fatigue. Now is not the time to try to tough things out. \u201cYour body is using all its energy to fight a virus that is infecting cell after cell,\u201d says Khan. \u201cEven with mild symptoms, you\u2019ll have some days when you feel fine and other days when you are tired and achey. You can potter around the house and make food if you need to, but you shouldn\u2019t be doing any more than that and, where possible, you should be on the sofa or in bed.\u201d Once you develop a fever, he says, \u201cyour body is starting to use energy to raise your core body temperature to make it an unfavourable environment for the virus to reproduce. You shouldn\u2019t wait until you feel tired [to rest], because by then you\u2019ve expended too much energy already.\u201d Keep drinking fluids Khan says: \u201cEverybody should be sticking to two to three litres of fluid a day\u201d \u2013 as normal. When you have a fever, says Saira Ghafur, an honorary respiratory consultant at St Mary\u2019s hospital in London, \u201cyou can become dehydrated, so you need to make sure that even if you don\u2019t feel like it, you\u2019re drinking as much as possible. If you feel you\u2019re not peeing very much, that\u2019s another sign you\u2019re very dehydrated and should seek medical advice.\u201d How to manage a fever Take paracetamol, rather than ibuprofen. There has been concern that ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory, could reduce immune function and make coronavirus symptoms worse, but there is not enough evidence to confirm this. Still, the advice is to take paracetamol for fever and muscle pain instead. \u201cIf you have been prescribed ibuprofen and develop symptoms of Covid-19 then discuss that with your medical practitioner,\u201d says Wingfield. Definitely don\u2019t rely on supplements or \u2018miracle\u2019 cures Khan has seen advice online about taking vitamin C to treat coronavirus \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean you should be trying this at home. \u201cIt has been used intravenously in very, very high doses in hospitals in China. That\u2019s a big difference to what you get in a tablet. The jury is still very much out in terms of using intravenous vitamin C for coronavirus.\u201d Taking a vitamin C tablet from the chemist or supermarket \u201cwon\u2019t stop you getting an infection and it won\u2019t help treat the infection\u201d, says Khan. And certainly don\u2019t try to take very high doses. Don\u2019t pin your hopes on \u201csuperfoods\u201d or the social media posts about \u201calkaline\u201d foods (a virus doesn\u2019t have a pH level, and you can\u2019t change the body\u2019s pH level through diet). What about garlic? \u201cIt may help reduce the length of things like a cold, but won\u2019t prevent it,\u201d says Khan. And there\u2019s no evidence it has any effect on coronavirus. Can breathing exercises help? It\u2019s far from clear. On Monday, the author JK Rowling shared a video of Sarfaraz Munshi, the head of urgent care at Queen\u2019s hospital in Romford, London, demonstrating breathing techniques that he said could relieve symptoms and prevent someone developing a secondary pneumonia infection. People with asthma and those recovering from pneumonia are often helped by respiratory physiotherapists, says Wingfield, \u201cwho can help support your breathing with exercises. The main thing you are trying to do is make patients\u2019 lungs open as much as they can and try and get rid of some of the fluid and inflammatory material.\u201d Coronavirus, says Khan, \u201ccauses inflammation around the alveoli, the air sacs at the peripheries of the lungs, and it can damage them. It reduces your lung capacity. If you are safely managing your condition at home [on advice from a doctor or the NHS 111 service], then breathing exercises might help. \u201cWhat you\u2019re really doing there is forcing air into the alveoli by taking big breaths in and holding the alveoli open, and that will help clear any excess mucus, pathogens, as well as stop them from becoming hardened, which can happen. This is with the caveat that you are safe to stay at home and you don\u2019t need to be in hospital. If there\u2019s any chance of pneumonia, you should be in hospital.\u201d However, Laura Breach, a spokeswoman for the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Respiratory Care (ACPRC), says while the exercises should be harmless for healthy individuals, she would not advise them, adding that they could make symptoms worse in someone suffering breathlessness. Although Munshi\u2019s video was well-intentioned, the ACPRC says the techniques are not correct (it is preparing its own video). If you did try the exercise, you only need to take three or four breaths so as not to hyperventilate and become dizzy, and if you have coronavirus symptoms, there is no need to make yourself cough as part of the exercise. \u201cWe would always encourage nose-breathing rather than mouth-breathing, because your nose is really important in humidifying the air that you breathe in and catching any particles in the air,\u201d says Breach. There is no evidence these exercises will help healthy people prepare for the illness, she says. \u201cThere are patients with longer-term respiratory conditions and we do teach them techniques to give them a better starting point. If it\u2019s something you should be doing then your healthcare professional will have already advised that.\u201d Instead, the ACPRC says: \u201cPropping yourself up with pillows, or leaning forward onto the back of a chair\u201d can be beneficial to breathlessness. Wingfield also questions whether the exercises can aid recovery from coronavirus \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a slightly evidence-free zone\u201d \u2013 and says if you are having trouble breathing, you should seek medical help rather than simply try to follow breathing exercises at home. \u201cBut they can keep your lungs moving, and some people might find these exercises meditative and stress-relieving,\u201d says Wingfield. Ghafur agrees: \u201cNone of this is evidence-based.\u201d But try lying on your front One of the big things in intensive care that we\u2019re seeing with a lot of patients,\u2019 says Ghafur, \u201cis you have to put them on a ventilator in what we call a prone position, which basically means you\u2019re lying on your front. It\u2019s not in any recommended guidance for patients who are not in intensive care, but if you\u2019re able to lie on your front for a while that can help breathing.\u201d There\u2019s no harm in trying it, she says, but only if you\u2019re generally fit and healthy. Do not try to lie on your front if you are older, infirm, have mobility problems or are pregnant. Lying continuously on your back is not ideal. \u201cIf you can sit and take deep breaths in and out, that will help any respiratory condition \u2013 you\u2019re taking in a bigger lungful of air and that will help remove any mucus.\u201d However, she adds that there is no evidence that this will improve your recovery."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
