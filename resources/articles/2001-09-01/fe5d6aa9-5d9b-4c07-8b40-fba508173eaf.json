Interest rates on the secure bank and building society accounts, the basis of many people's income seeking, have tumbled. And, if economists are to be believed, they have not yet hit their floor. Those who ventured into riskier investments, such as shares, investment trusts and unit trusts, have seen the value of their capital collapse. So how to square the equation of falling returns with growing income needs? Here are some suggestions. \u0095 Higher rewards mean higher risks. If you do decide to be brave, try to spread your money around several investments. \u0095 Don't panic. The stock market may be falling fast and furiously but that is no reason to ditch a share portfolio now. Those who rush for the equity exit will either take a loss on their investment or gain less than they would have last year. And once your money is in a cash deposit, it can never recover. Letting your portfolio ride the market ups and downs means you will participate in any upturn. In the meantime, the income you receive will not be greatly different. Some companies will cut dividends, but the majority will not. \u0095 Look afresh at shares. When markets were at their peak in late 1999, the yield on the FT All Share Index was practically invisible. Now it stands at 3% - still not generous, but that's an average and it is possible to find many good shares which pay more. But avoid those with dividend yields higher than around 6% - they are from companies that are set for bad times. No one knows how far the stock market still has to fall, but it has to be better buying now than at the top of the market. \u0095 Income oriented unit trusts should enjoy a return to favour. Not only do they offer a good and growing yield, they also tend to invest in old economy shares which should better withstand current storms. We'll still be buying food at supermarkets and using water, gas and electricity long after everyone has forgotten dotcoms. \u0095 Be prepared to dip into capital. You have to spend the cash sometimes. If you are really mean and store it up, your family could lose 40% of it in inheritance tax when you die. \u0095 Explore stakeholder and other personal pensions. You must buy an annuity with the pension pot before you reach 75, but you can get tax relief on your contribution - up to 40% if you are a higher rate taxpayer - then take a further 25% of the pension pot as a tax free lump sum. This can roughly halve the net cost of the annuity, effectively doubling the returns. \u0095 Have you a maturing endowment or other life insurance linked savings policy? You could leave the money with the insurer then turn part of your proceeds into income each year. If this is limited to 5%, there will be no tax charge. Money in these policies usually attracts very low charges - but always check first."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
