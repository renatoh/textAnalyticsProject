Last week, the board of AOL-Time Warner finally did the deed - by voting to drop the AOL from the company name, change its stock exchange listing code and revert to being plain old Time Warner Inc. 'We believe that our new name better reflects the portfolio of our valuable businesses and ends any confusion between our corporate name and the America Online brand name for our investors, partners, and the public,' said Richard Parsons, chief executive of Time Warner. Or, as one market analyst put it more succinctly, 'AOL is a very unattractive tail on a very beautiful dog. It's the best possible thing for a shareholder - admit your mistake and move on.' Some mistake - it is reckoned to have cost between $50 billion and $80 bn. But we will let that pass: what is a few billion dollars of pension-fund money between friends? But before moving on, let us remember that the Time Warner board has still not finished the job that its shareholders and the public interest require it to finish. For Time Warner still owns and operates AOL, and that is an arrangement which is not in the best interests of society. Why? Because it violates a basic principle that those who control access to the net should not also control content. AOL is still a gigantic ISP, providing a pipe to the internet for millions of people. If left to its own devices, it will try to ensure that the digital pap produced by its corporate owners slides more easily down that pipe than any other stuff coming off the net. That is why the merger should never have been allowed in the first place, and why it would make social and commercial sense for Time Warner to shed AOL. But the AOL fiasco is not the only idiocy afoot. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) - the trade body that represents the interests of record companies - has rolled out its latest campaign in the war against online file-sharing: it has begun suing people who have copyrighted material in the shared folders of their hard disks. In the past, the RIAA has focused its wrath on services such as like Napster, which facilitated file-sharing. But since this failed to stem the tide, the industry has been steadily going down the ladder and has finally reached the bottom rung - individual users. The threat is clear: 'If you have unauthorised music files on your hard drive, then our lawyers are coming after you.' This tactic has been made possible by a set of court rulings which may in the end prove problematic, but which for the time being have frightened parents and university administrations about the financial consequences of the online behaviour of those in their charge. My guess is that in the end the US court judgments which oblige ISPs to reveal the identities of file-sharing subscribers will be overturned on privacy and constitutional grounds - because they assume that anyone with copyrighted files is, a priori, guilty. As one US judge put it last week, it's a bit like assuming that a man who has an extensive library at home and leaves his door open is guilty if someone nips in and makes illicit photocopies of a book. However, for the time being, the injunctions stand and the RIAA's intimidation campaign is in full swing. In prospect are cases in which the parents of 12-year-olds will be sued for hundreds of thousands of dollars by lawyers protecting the corporate interests of outfits like Time Warner. Which, in case you're wondering, is the same company that was so concerned about its shareholders' interests that it blew $50 billion of their money on a crazed merger. \u00b7 john.naughton@observer.co.uk \u00b7 www.briefhistory.com/footnotes/"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
