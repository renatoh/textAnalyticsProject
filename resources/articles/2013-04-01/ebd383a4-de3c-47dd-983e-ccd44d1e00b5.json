The earthquake toppled buildings, triggered landslides and disrupted phone and power connections in the mountainous Lushan county. The village of Longmen was hit particularly hard, with authorities saying nearly all the buildings had been destroyed in a frightening, minute-long tremor. \"It was such a big quake everyone was scared,\" said a woman who answered a phone at a kindergarten hours later and declined to give her name. \"We all fled for our lives.\" Rescuers turned the square outside the Lushan county hospital into a triage centre, where medical personnel bandaged bleeding victims, according to footage on China television. Rescuers dynamited boulders that had fallen across roads to reach Longmen and other areas further up the mountain valleys, state media reported. The quake, which was measured by the earthquake administration at a magnitude of 7.0 and by the US Geological Survey at 6.6, struck shortly after 8am, when many people were at home, sleeping or having breakfast. People in their underwear and wrapped in blankets ran into the streets as far away asChengdu, 115 kms east of Lushan. Chengdu's airport shut down for about an hour. Lushan is situated where the Sichuan plain meets foothills that eventually rise to the Tibetan plateau and sits atop the Longmenshan fault. It was along that faultline that a devastating magnitude 7.9 quake struck on 12 May 2008, leaving more than 90,000 dead or missing. \"It was just like 12 May,\" Liu Xi, a writer in Ya'an city who was jolted awake by Saturday's quake, said via a private message on his account on Sina Corporation's Twitter-like Weibo service. \"All the home decorations fell at once and the old house cracked.\" The Bifengxia panda reserve, which is near Lushan, was said not to be affected . Dozens of pandas were moved to Bifengxia from another reserve, Wolong, after their habitat was wrecked by the 2008 quake."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
