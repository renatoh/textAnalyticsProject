Is it churlish to point out that the IRC board of overseers includes Nobel peace prizewinner and Cambodia carpet-bomber Henry Kissinger, a man indirectly responsible for more homelessness and misery than anyone else alive on the planet? Probably. \u2022 Less than three weeks since Pope Francis's election and Buenos Aires is already looking to cash in with Pope Tours. \"The whole world wants to find out more about the new, fascinating head of the church,\" Alfredo Adriani, the city's director of culture, expostulates to the local paper El Clarin. With itineraries and self-guided tours already being planned, there will be stops outside the pontiff's childhood home and the square where he used to play football with his mates, as well as at religious sites such as his former cathedral. Isn't the new pope supposed to be making a thing about his humility? Maybe, but he has allegedly given his approval to the idea during an audience with Mauricio Macri, the city's mayor. Anything to take their minds off the Falklands. \u2022 A late election result from the City of London: Dead Wood, three; Mark Clarke, nowhere. Readers with long memories may remember the bumptious young Tory from the Young Britons' Foundation who was accused of dirty tricks during the last general election, when he stood unavailingly in Tooting. Something about an Election Commission referral in relation to the sabotage of a rival candidate's website \u2026 anyway, he's been accused again, this time of sending a flyer to the august electorate of the traditionally independent (that means most are Tories) City of London Corporation, suggesting that rival candidates had run up large expense accounts. There was a need to remove dead wood from the corporation he announced, to the London Evening Standard, naming three names. Alas, when the votes were counted last week, all three were re-elected. Down among the also-rans \u2013 though not half as far down as the Labour candidate \u2013 one Mark Clarke: four more votes and he might have made it, but now he'll just have to try again somewhere else. \u2022 Publication of the political memoir of the year is modestly announced by the publisher Biteback and, just when the Labour party thought it was getting over its late traumas, it's by the notorious former spin doctor Damian McBride, now working for the Catholic charity Cafod. McBride, you remember, had to go after being caught discussing fabricating smears against Tory politicians. The book will be called Power Trip: A Decade of Policy, Plots and Spin and is set to be published in September, usefully just in time for the Labour party conference. Biteback's publisher, former Tory candidate Iain Dale, gloats that everyone knows McBride is a brilliantly incisive writer, in a unique position to expose what being at the centre of power in the Brown government was really like, so no schadenfreude there, obviously. \"Iain was the last person I expected to be working with, but his thoughts on what this book should be about exactly matched my own,\" says McBride modestly. He fondly hopes it will give an insight into life in government today. You bet he does. \u2022 Quizzical response from Labour peer Toby Harris to health secretary Jeremy Hunt's matey letter to health authorities after the Francis report into the Mid-Staffs trust disaster. It was signed just Jeremy. \"There are a few politicians who are so well known that they are referred to almost universally by their first names,\" harrumphs Harris. \"Jeremy Hunt clearly thinks he is part of that select band. Perhaps this is intended as a subtle signal that he is available either as a replacement for the prime minister or as the next Conservative mayoral candidate.\" Or perhaps he was just trying to be friendly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
