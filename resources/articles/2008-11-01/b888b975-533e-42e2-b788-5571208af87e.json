Here's me quoting Zack who in turns quotes the AP and then returns to the narration starting with \"In other words:: But note the way in which AP seems to have obtained the information. High up in the story, it reports: Information about the deportation case was disclosed and confirmed by two separate sources, one a federal law enforcement official. The information they made available is known to officials in the federal government, but the AP could not establish whether anyone at a political level in the Bush administration or in the McCain campaign had been involved in its release. In other words, it looks like someone in the Bush administration leaked the information, with the goal of throwing a last-minute wrench into Obama's campaign. And someone else confirmed it, with similar motives. On the record, of course, the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, a unit of the Department of Homeland Security, is telling reporters it can't comment on any individual person's immigration status. It would appear to be a violation of department procedures, at the least, to leak such information. We'll probably never know. In the meantime, is this a big story -- the aunt's illegal status, I mean? Could make a difference of a point or two in a small number of states, I think, but in broad terms, it's no October (or November) Surprise. Which raises the broader question of why hasn't the swift-boating of Obama -- you know, the swift-boat equivalents of Ayers and Khalidi and so on -- worked its magic for the GOP the way it has in the past? This is the subject of my print column for Monday's paper. I'm sure you just can't wait!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
