So are the granite-jawed landlords who prowl the corridors to pounce angrily upon late returners. Well, I assume I am right - they can't all be dead. Jeannette Hyde wasn't far wrong in her article last Sunday, when she gently chided Prince Charles for having it easy while the rest of us, apparently, aren't so lucky. Anyone who experienced the linoleum-lined floors and nylon sheets of another age is unlikely to have forgotten them. Even worse were the rules; they governed the amount of gas you could use, the time you returned and the time you emerged. To spend hours in the rain with a gang of whingeing children while awaiting the end of curfew was enough to frazzle the most hardened of B&amp;B users. Gerard Morgan-Grenville, in his recent autobiography, tells of a landlady from hell on the Isle of Wight in the early '50s. She monitored the rule-keeping like a malevolent vulture. Gerard got his own back in the most unexpected, and expensive, way. He emptied his car of sump oil and, not having developed environmental consciousness in those days, poured it down the nearest drain-hole. This, he was not to know, was really an air-duct that led directly - if unusually - into his landlady's sitting room. The results can be imagined, and he left. However, the picture is not as gloomy as that story suggests. The changes that we have seen since the war have swept over the B&amp;B landladies too; they are not an evolutionary backwater. Some of them live in houses that the rest of us can only dream of. Some are lively, interesting, highly-educated, open-minded and entertaining. Some do it because they love having people around. Some just like to chat. Some like to listen. There are thousands of them and we have spent the last six years tracking down the most interesting ones, people who live in houses that Jeannette Hyde would enjoy sleeping in. But we have also found that there is a new grimness to replace the old: what we call the Creeping Guest House Syndrome. When you find little laminated notices in your room, when the trouser-press takes pride of place and the TV looms maniacally in the corner, when you creep down to a breakfast that parades on your plate like soldiers with a hangover, when every useful item - like the loo-paper - hides under a decorated hat, then you know that the Tourist Board has visited. Or your host may just be that sort of person. There are thousands of them, but the good news is that it is easy to avoid them if you buy our book. \u00b7 Alastair Sawday is publisher of the 'Special Places to Stay Guidebooks', including British Bed &amp; Breakfasts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
