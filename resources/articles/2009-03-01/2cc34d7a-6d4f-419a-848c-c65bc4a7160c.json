The Aston Villa striker was on the receiving end of ironic cheering when he was substituted during yesterday's defeat to Tottenham Hotspur, but he claims that he is unfazed by the reaction and pointed to the 10 goals he has scored in the Premier League this term as evidence of his contribution. The England international has scored once in his last 15 appearances for Villa and endured another unproductive afternoon against Spurs in front of Franco Baldini, Fabio Capello's England assistant. Martin O'Neill said afterwards that the striker was \"low on confidence\", but the Villa manager also made it clear that he was upset with a large section of the home support for their response when Agbonlahor's number was raised 11 minutes from time. It was a chastening moment and represented quite a turnaround for a player whose eye-catching performances earlier in the campaign brought a first full England cap in November. A second arrived last month in Spain but, with Capello making no secret of the importance of current form, it is difficult to believe Agbonlahor will retain his place in the squad for the upcoming fixtures against Slovakia and Ukraine. Agbonlahor, however, remains positive. \"If you look at last season I went through a similar run and the goals will come,\" said the 22-year-old, who finished last season with four goals in six matches after a 12-game drought. \"I am not worried at all. People forget how many goals I have got.\" O'Neill suggested before the Tottenham fixture that he would be wasting his time if he tried to talk Agbonlahor out of his slump\"I do believe that regardless of how much encouragement a manager gives to a player, if he's a centre-forward that player thrives on scoring goals,\" he said. However, he appeared to have reviewed that theory in the wake of the crowd's reaction of the Villa supporters on Sunday and was due to speak to the striker yesterday. O'Neill was also expected to address the rest of the squad as he seeks to arrest an alarming slide that has seen Villa fail to win in their last seven matches and surrender fourth spot in the Premier League to Arsenal. With their next two fixtures trips to Liverpool and Manchester United, it seems likely that things will get worse before they get better. Agbonlahor, however, refuses to accept that defeat at Anfield and Old Trafford is inevitable. \"These are two massive away games now. We have to look to go to Liverpool and get something and Manchester United as well. We have to try and get our form back away from home. \"Hopefully we can go to Liverpool and attack and try and get a win. Liverpool have had two great results [against Real Madrid and Manchester United] but we can go there and cause an upset like we have done against big teams in the past.\"was adamant they would not \"throw away the hard work\". \"We know it is going to be tough but it will be tough for [Arsenal] as well. Even when we were six points ahead of Arsenal, they were still regarded as favourites because of the squad they have. Now we are fifth but we still think we can get there. We've just got to start picking up some points.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
