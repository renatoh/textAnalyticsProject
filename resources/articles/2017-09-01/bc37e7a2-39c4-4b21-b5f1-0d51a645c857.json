Kuenssberg, who has previously been jeered by some Labour supporters, will be accompanied by a security team inside and outside the conference zone in Brighton, the reports said. Kuenssberg has frequently been targeted with sexist abuse online and the BBC is understood to have given her access to a bodyguard during the general election campaign. The corporation did not comment on the reports of her protection at the Labour conference, telling the Sun on Sunday that it does \u201cnot comment on security issues\u201d. However, the Times carried a photo of Kuenssberg, the first woman to be the BBC\u2019s political editor, with a man the paper identified as a former soldier who now worked as a security consultant for the BBC. The abuse aimed at Kuenssberg has followed complaints that she is not neutral, and treats the Labour leader and his party unfairly. However, she has also been targeted by supporters of other parties. At a Ukip press conference before June\u2019s general election she was booed and barracked by party members when she asked a question of the then leader, Paul Nuttall. The BBC\u2019s chairman, David Clementi, said politicians and social media companies should clamp down on the increasingly \u201cexplicit and aggressive\u201d abuse suffered by BBC journalists, saying women in particular were being targeted. Speaking at the Royal Television Society convention in Cambridge, Clementi \u2013 who did not name any of the journalists concerned \u2013 said female journalists in particular faced abuse \u201con an almost daily basis\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
