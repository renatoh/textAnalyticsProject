Is his firm guilty of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d? In other words, is the world\u2019s biggest fund manager, with an astonishing $7tn of assets under its roof, posing as a pioneer of climate activism while actually dragging its feet? The accusation was made by Sir Christopher Hohn, another fund management billionaire. His hedge fund, TCI, is warning companies to improve their disclosures on carbon emissions and actions to reduce pollution, or face votes against the re-election of directors. But his pointed criticism of BlackRock was almost as significant. Hohn said out loud what others say in private: that Fink\u2019s declared environmental concerns are not matched on the ground by BlackRock\u2019s fund managers. Naturally, BlackRock disputes the characterisation, saying it has \u201cengaged\u201d with 370 companies on \u201cclimate risks\u201d in the past two years and arguing it makes the issue one of its \u201ctop five priorities\u201d. The firm points out that it was a founder member of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and sent letters to more than 100 of the most carbon-intensive companies last year. Yet the accusation is not that BlackRock is doing nothing. It\u2019s a question of how hard the firm is pushing. One can certainly understand why Hohn could view BlackRock\u2019s voting record on climate-related resolutions as \u201cappalling\u201d, as he put it to the FT. InfluenceMap and ShareAction, two research groups, agreed in recent reports that Fink\u2019s firm backs only about 10% of climate-related resolutions tabled by shareholders, whereas big European names such as Legal &amp; General and UBS are in the 80%-90% range. BlackRock would protest that you can\u2019t judge a fund manager solely by its record. But, even on regular day-to-day dealings with companies, fingers are being pointed. This territory is hard to measure since \u201cengagement\u201d means conversations with corporate managements that take place behind closed doors but InfluenceMap looked at what fund managers say themselves. It concluded that, among the world\u2019s top 15 asset managers only Allianz, L&amp;G and UBS \u201cstrongly and consistently\u201d try to change business models in line with Paris Agreement targets. BlackRock, as well as fellow US giants Vanguard and State Street, was deemed to be in the slow camp of managers that call on companies to consider climate risks but \u201cdo not drive behaviour change around climate models or policy lobbying\u201d. Fink may still feel that BlackRock\u2019s reputation as a laggard is unfair. If so, he has the ideal platform to address the accusation of soft-pedalling. His letter to fellow chief executives generates acres of coverage every year and, if he wishes to issue a blistering call for corporations to act faster to tackle the climate emergency, he is free to do so. If he named a few names, instead of issuing bland generalities about the importance of companies having a \u201cpurpose\u201d, so much the better. He is also free, of course, to get heavier on the voting front. BlackRock is so big it owns stakes of 5%-plus in many large companies, which can be enough to make or break an investor rebellion on a climate issue. Most of all, Fink should know that Hohn was echoing a common sentiment, at least in Europe: that BlackRock is increasingly part of the problem. Not a good look for Ted Baker Another day, another item for the non-executive directors at Ted Baker to investigate. This one concerns the overstatement of the value of the inventory on the balance sheet. Suspected inflation of \u00a320m to \u00a325m equates to about 10% of the stock value shown in the last balance sheet. It\u2019s a bad look, which is why the shares, which had already collapsed by three-quarters this year, fell another 8%. Mind you, a balance sheet overstatement may not be the most pressing concern. On the value front, say the critics, the real worry is the price of Ted\u2019s clothes in the shops."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
