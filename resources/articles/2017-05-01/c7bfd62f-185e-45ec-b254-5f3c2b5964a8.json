In this busy day and age, many of us, most working days, just grab a quick breakfast on the run, or even skip it altogether in our rush to dash out the door \u2014 making it all the more special when we\u2019re able to enjoy a lingering morning repast with family and friends. When I\u2019m at home, midweek breakfast is pretty basic, such as a simple bowl of oats with a nice cup of tea or a strong coffee \u2014 but at the weekend it\u2019s a whole different story. Macadamia and zucchini fritters with smoked salmon and corn salsa These fritters make a lovely brunch. We deep-fry ours, but you could also just shallow-fry them in a frying pan on the stove. Makes 8 4 crumpets olive oil, for pan-frying 150g baby English spinach leaves 400g smoked salmon 8 warm poached eggs 60g piece of fresh horseradish, peeled Corn salsa 1 cooked corn cob, kernels removed 1 avocado, flesh diced 1\u20448 red onion, finely diced \u00bd red chilli, chopped \u00bc bunch Vietnamese mint, leaves only, roughly chopped \u00bc bunch coriander (cilantro), leaves only, roughly chopped 2 tbsp lime juice 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil Macadamia and zucchini fritters olive oil, for pan-frying \u00bc onion, diced 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 2 teaspoons smoked paprika 2 large zucchini (courgettes) 2 free-range eggs 100g (\u00b2\u2044\u00b3 cup) self-raising flour \u00bd tsp baking powder 3 tbsp macadamia nuts, roughly chopped vegetable oil, for deep-frying For the corn salsa Just before serving, combine all the ingredients in a bowl, being careful not to break up the avocado too much. Cover and set aside. For the fritters Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook for 3\u20134 minutes, until the onion is softened but not coloured. Add the paprika and cook for 30 seconds, then transfer to a bowl to cool. Grate the zucchini. Squeeze the zucchini with your hands to remove the excess liquid and set aside. Whisk the eggs in a bowl. Add the flour, baking powder and a pinch of salt and mix to combine; the mixture should be quite thick. If it is too runny, you will not be able to make fritters, so add a little extra flour. Stir in the grated zucchini and the saut\u00e9ed onion mixture, then fold in the nuts. Two-thirds fill a deep-fryer or large heavy-based saucepan with vegetable oil. Heat to 170C (325F), or until a cube of bread dropped into the oil turns golden brown in 20 seconds. Using a tablespoon, and working in batches, gently place dollops of the fritter mixture into the hot oil and cook for 3\u20134 minutes, turning a few times. Drain on paper towel and season with salt and pepper. To serve Toast the crumpets in a toaster until golden. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat, then cook the spinach for 1\u20132 minutes, until wilted. Season, then transfer to paper towels and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Place the toasted crumpets on serving plates. Top each with a little spinach, smoked salmon, a poached egg and a dollop of corn salsa. Grate the horseradish over the top. Season again and serve with the warm zucchini fritters.
