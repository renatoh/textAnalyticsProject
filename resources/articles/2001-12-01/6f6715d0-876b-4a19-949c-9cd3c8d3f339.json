In the early 60s, when there was much talk of restructuring and modernisation, Alan Hardaker, the secretary of the Football League, proposed five divisions of 20 clubs, but as a sop to those clubs worried about the loss of fixtures and revenue he also put forward the idea of the League Cup by way of a little compensation. It has to be remembered that in those faraway Perry Como Christmas days, floodlights were still something of a novelty, to be switched on towards the end of a match on a dark winter Saturday afternoon. The midweek League Cup competition, specifically designed to be played under floodlights, was seen as a chance to utilise them to the full. Needless to say, the clubs totally rejected the idea of restructuring the league but, in that grand and lasting tradition of wanting their cake and eating it , grabbed the League Cup with alacrity. True, several of the leading clubs were rather snooty about it in the first few years, some refusing to take part, but once it went to Wembley in 1967 - the Rodney Marsh final - and also secured entry into Europe, the ugly duckling was transformed into something approaching a goose, if never exactly a gliding swan. Mind you, Liverpool took the competition so seriously that from 1981-1984 nobody else was allowed a look-in, although by then, after 20 years, it had become the Milk Cup, another small irony given Margaret Thatcher's milk-snatching propensities. No matter. Via Milk, Littlewoods, Rumbelows and Coca-Cola, we have finally arrived at the worthy Worthington. And trouble. It did not take a genius to see it coming from the moment the Champions League expanded. Before that the Premiership clubs were quite happy to have a go and see what happened, but once most of the pre-Christmas midweeks became filled up with European fixtures the clubs involved, led by Manchester United, made the conscious decision to play reserve teams. The usual concession were made: clubs in Europe were made exempt until the third round, replays were replaced by penalty shootouts, etc, etc. But this week's results at White Hart Lane and Ewood Park have left many wondering if the whole competition is now nothing more than a pitiable charade, and no longer worth the winning. Arsenal's Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who despite not having won a single trophy since the Double in 1998 appears to be regarded as a sage in some quarters, suggested on Tuesday that the Worthington Cup might be stripped of its European entry status, which is particularly galling coming from a manager whose team selections, like those of Sir Alex Ferguson, have debased the competition. If for no other reason, the Worthington Cup must survive in order that the burblings of the super-rich do not suddenly become holy writ. If those clubs involved in Europe do not want to take part, they should simply opt out at the beginning of the season. No harm in that. But they won't, not as long as a European place is at stake. Wenger, no doubt echoing his chairman, would not have made his weasel remarks had Arsenal failed to qualify for the second phase of the Champions League. For a team such as Bolton, desperately struggling to stay in the Premiership and hunting their 40-plus points, the decision to play an understrength team may be regarded as an honest step to unclutter the start of the often crucial new year programme. But it is doubtful whether Bolton's fans would agree, and the decision may yet backfire badly on Sam Allardyce. The Worthington Cup, as Liverpool demonstrated last season, remains an extremely useful means to kick-start a team into winning mode. Glenn Hoddle knows this well enough, no matter the strength of the opposition. On top of all this came the ice-cold words of John Nagle, the Football League's head of communications. \"More than 60% of the Football League's \u00a3105m-a-year television agreement is attributable to the Worthington Cup. Therefore anything that damages it as a competition, such as stripping it of its Uefa Cup place, would have huge ramifications. Without the competition, professional football in Divisions Two and Three would be unsustainable and the gap between the Premier and the First Division would become totally unbridgeable for ever.\" Those who look to conspiracy theories might wonder, in view of all the recent talk about the ridiculously named Phoenix League, if the irreparable damaging of the Worthington Cup is precisely what the Premiership chairmen want, so that the smaller clubs can be cut adrift to pursue some sort of semi-professional afterlife. Fortunately, so far, both the lower-division clubs and the Worthington Cup have displayed remarkable staying power in the face of numerous adversities. But as the recession bites, and the greed of the top few clubs grows by the day, fear increasingly stalks the boardrooms - and decisions made in times of fear are apt to be disastrous."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
