Ever since the Roman grid disappeared under the meandering paths of British and Saxon settlement, the street pattern of the capital has had a life of its own. Today it can be the despair of visitors and natives alike. It is also supremely inefficient. Barely a quarter of central London's streets are used for traffic circulation - as opposed to 90% of New York's; most could be paved or built over without loss of convenience. The early maps were attempts both to glorify what the poet William Dunbar called \"the flour of Cities all\" and give some semblance of dignity to what was mostly an unplanned, foetid and visually chaotic warren along the riverside hills north of the Thames. Their most distinctive feature, into the 20th century, was the astonishing array of church spires, all paying obeisance to the mighty hulk of St Paul's overlooking the western rampart by the Fleet. From the 17th century onwards, mapping took on a different purpose. It recorded the sprawl of a city that was blessedly free of the continental need for walls and high-density defensible tenements. Development spread luxuriously over the suburbs away from disease and smoke. This new city prided itself on the spacious layouts of the great estates - Bedford, Southampton, Grosvenor, Portman and Harley-Cavendish - yielding early gated communities of leasehold properties for middle-class buyers. Cartographers took to balloons to marvel at what London's citizens had fashioned without the aid of emperor, king, pope or even civic government. London was essentially unplanned. Maps now became essential tools to charting an anarchy that was to become the world's imperial metropolis. They depicted turnpikes, railways, docks and sewers. Tallis's Georgian London Street Views illustrated the impact of early fire and building regulations. The Victorian Charles Booth, in the earliest work of mass social research, mapped the classes of London, colour-coded by income. By the 20th century, cartography was a branch not just of geography but of sociology, politics, architecture, even art. Maps were needed to chart the evolution of London government. Henry Beck's \"art deco\" tube map, unlike the bus map, acquired and has never lost iconic status . There were maps of bomb damage, of crime, of demonstration routes, of underground tunnels, of immigrants, of light and heat loss. Most terrifying of all have been the manifestations of architectural fantasy. Mercifully, Wren was stopped from rebuilding the post-fire city on a grid plan (which would by today be rebuilt as a grid of concrete and glass boxes). Nash's West End plan was forced into baroque curves to circumvent rich neighbourhoods and wipe out poor ones. The greatest horrors were occasioned by the relics of the Blitz, when architects and town planners thought to outdo Hitler by recreating London as a Corbusian ideal of motorways, decks and towers - and nearly succeeded. Their frigid vision, realised in London Wall and along Upper Thames Street, was intended to spread across the whole of central London, \"rebuilding it for the age of the car\". There were cities on stilts, cities on slabs, cities where no one could walk, cities where architects could rule untrammelled by people. The Strand was to be a motorway, Mayfair was to be rebuilt with cars on the ground and people in the air. Nothing equals the planner's dream as an evocation of 20th-century totalitarianism. Nor is the 21st century free of it. London's maps are so much more than charts. The snaking Thames, highways darting off as if on some long-forgotten mission, the dense rats' nest of side streets and alleys, the cacophony of sedate squares interspersed with raucous high streets, all render London the most obtuse and least biddable of places. For most citizens, London is still a place of disjointed monuments and random familiarity, linked by no man's land. Its maps suggest a place able to embrace all humours and absorb all peoples. They give meaning to chaos. They are what London is. Mapping London: Making Sense Of The City, by Simon Foxell, is published by Black Dog at \u00a339.95.
