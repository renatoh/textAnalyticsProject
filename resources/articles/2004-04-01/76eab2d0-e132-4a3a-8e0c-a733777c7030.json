The media were as dismissive as the 40,000 crowd on Tuesday. The newspaper La Naci\u00f3n said: \"Apart from the obligation to win, Argentina fell short in almost everything else; in their overall play, in goals and in individual performances.\" Argentina are unbeaten after five of their 18 matches. \"The World Cup qualifiers are not easy,\" said Crespo after scoring for his fourth competitive international in a row. \"We shouldn't forget that, historically, Argentina have always had trouble qualifying. \"I was a bit upset by the public's reaction. I think they need to be a bit more patient. This is a team under construction.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
