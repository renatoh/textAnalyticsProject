James Mason's geologist leads an intrepid Victorian band into an extinct Icelandic volcano, and into hot water as well. Batteries Not Included (Matthew Robbins, 1987) 3pm, ITV1 A soft-centred but intelligent bit of sci-fi whimsy, as you'd expect from producer Spielberg. Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy are a lovable old couple being leaned on by property developers to leave their rundown New York apartment, and getting help to beat off the thugs from a bunch of tiny aliens. Clockwise (Christopher Morahan, 1985) 4.15pm, C4 John Cleese's ever-so-punctual headteacher Brian Stimpson is flattened by time's winged chariot in this Michael Frayn-scripted chuckler. Heading for a conference in Norwich, he boards the wrong train and is soon reduced to impotent fury by the sort of travel nightmare horribly familiar to Virgin Rail customers. Bridget Jones's Diary (Sharon Maguire, 2001) 9.25pm, C4 As the sequel hits the cinemas, here's a chance to revisit the original. It's the ultimate girls'-night-in movie, except that such is the success of this adaptation of Helen Fielding's mega-selling 1990s novel that boys can enjoy it too. Ren\u00e9e Zellweger is a brilliant Bridget, the thirtysomething singleton who eats, drinks and smokes too much and is looking for love - but with Hugh Grant's caddish Cleaver, or Colin Firth's decent Darcy? The episodic diary format rushes through a succession of set-pieces (Bridget coming down the firefighters' pole; Bridget and her big knickers) and is simply delicious fun. Conan The Destroyer (Richard Fleischer, 1984) 11.25pm, Five Fleischer is a cut above your average director of swords'n'sorcery adventures: he lops off the doom-laden, philosophical nonsense of the earlier Conan The Barbarian and settles into a fast lope of fantasy action straight out of Robert E Howard's muscle-brained tales. Arnold Schwarzenegger is again the wandering Cimmerian, on a quest to restore his lover to life; Grace Jones makes an impressive dark age warrior. Duets (Bruce Paltrow, 2000) 11.55pm, BBC2 A musical American odyssey that follows three mismatched couples as they head for a karaoke contest in Omaha, Nebraska. The most interesting pair are sneaky songster Huey Lewis reuniting with his daughter, Gwyneth Paltrow: directed by her father, Bruce, her performance lacks tone, but there's nothing wrong with her singing voice. Surviving Picasso (James Ivory, 1996) 2.25am, ITV1) Anthony Hopkins evinces elemental passion in this portrait of the artist as an old bull. Among the women drawn to his Picasso are Jane Lapotaire, Julianne Moore, Susannah Harker and Natascha McElhone, who as young artist Francoise Gilot makes an impressive screen debut. But it's somehow a bit strange that in spite of all the Spanish/Parisian heat creative angst - not to mention voracious sex - it somehow lacks heart. Sunday November 14 The Blue Max (John Guillermin, 1966) 12.50pm, BBC2 A first world war aerial drama with George Peppard as a would-be Red Baron intent on winning the highest of honours, the Blue Max. James Mason's scheming Prussian proves even more ruthless. All very effective, but the whizzbang plane fights provide the highlights. The Parent Trap (Nancy Meyers, 1998) 5.40pm, Five This decent updating of the 1961 original has freckly Lindsay Lohan in the Hayley Mills dual role of twins separated soon after birth, one growing up in London, the other in the US. How they finally reunite, and bring together estranged parents Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson, is the stuff of a likably sentimental comedy. Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines (Jonathan Mostow, 2003) 9pm, Five No James Cameron at the helm this time around, but Mostow constructs an efficient third chapter of the cyborg saga. It's the usual blend of state-of-the-art special effects and slushy man-and-machine friendship, between Arnold Schwarzenegger's soft-circuited T-101 and young rebel leader John Connor (Nick Stahl). Still, a new self-deprecating sense of humour is evident. Rock Star (Stephen Herek, 2001) 11.05pm, C4 Tribute band vocalist Mark Wahlberg realises his rock dream when the band he worships - a Judas Priest-like Steel Dragon - calls him up as replacement lead singer. Problem is, he discovers that life as a world-famous rock star isn't really as much fun as he expected. A likable heavy metal comedy with Jennifer Aniston. Sling Blade (Billy Bob Thornton, 1996) 11.20pm, BBC2 The actor/writer Thornton's astonishing debut as director is about as leftfield as they come: the story of a mentally-challenged Arkansas man finally released from psychiatric hospital after murdering his mother and her lover when he was 12 years old. He is befriended by a boy (Lucas Black) and his mother (Natalie Canerday), but new problems emerge. Beautifully, tenderly performed. Citizen X (Chris Gerolmo, 1995) 12.05pm, BBC1 The true, gruesome story of Andrei Chikatilo, the worst serial killer in Soviet history (give or take Stalin and his henchmen). The former teacher went undetected by incompetent police from 1982 to 1990 while he murdered and mutilated more than 50 children. Stephen Rea stars as Lieutenant Burakov, who pursues the killer (played by Jeffrey DeMunn); plus weighty support from Donald Sutherland and Max Von Sydow. Monday November 15 Hotel Reserve (Lance Comfort, Max Greene, Victor Hanbury, 1944) 1.30pm, BBC2 A dour little British wartime thriller adapted from the masterly Eric Ambler's novel, Epitaph For A Spy. Strong on atmosphere and suspense, it concerns espionage shenanigans at a French hotel, where the hunt is on for a Nazi spy. Tuesday November 16 Farewell My Lovely (Edward Dmytryk, 1945) 1.30pm, BBC2 This adaptation of Raymond Chandler's novel marked the beginning of 1940s film noir and the reinvention of crooner Dick Powell as a serious actor - his Philip Marlowe was thought by many superior to Bogart's. Lovingly crafted by Dmytryk, with sharp dialogue, gloomy photography and fine performances: Mike Mazurki was the definitive Moose Malloy, setting the private eye after Claire Trevor's marvellous Velma. First Blood (Ted Kotcheff, 1982) 11.15pm, BBC1 Introducing Rambo, the former Green Beret who goes bonkers after being knocked about by the redneck sheriff's men in a bad little midwest town. Busting out of jail and into the woods, he holds off the cops and National Guard and outwits his old commander Richard Crenna, before heading back to town for a showdown with hefty sheriff Brian Dennehy. Sly Stallone basically shifts his put-upon Rocky persona out of the ring for a little outdoor exercise; and it's done with breathless ferocity. Leon The Pig Farmer (Vadim Jean, Gary Sinyor, 1992) 11.20pm, BBC2 A crisp little low-budget comedy in which young north London Jewish lad Leon (Mark Frankel) discovers he is not the son of net-curtain manufacturer Sidney Geller (David De Keyser), but, due to experimental artificial insemination, the offspring of a Yorkshire pig farmer (Brian Glover). Not the sharpest attack on religious bigotry. Damage (Louis Malle, 1992) 12.45am, C4 Very swish, very sexy, and about as believable as a spin doctor's promise. Jeremy Irons is a respectable, wettish Tory MP who goes off the rails when he meets beautiful Juliette Binoche. She's also involved with his son (Rupert Graves), but that doesn't stop them bonking like bunnies. The elemental passion turns their worlds upside down. Wednesday November 17 The Mummy Returns (Stephen Sommers, 2001) 9pm, ITV1 A swift reincarnation of the 1999 hit, with all the major characters reunited for another Indiana Jonesy-foray into the Egyptian catacombs. Brendan Fraser makes a wholehearted action hero as Rick, who with brainy Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), now his wife, and her dopey-but-lovable brother (John Hannah) has to save the world from the resurrected mummy, his hordes of dog-soldiers and general apocalypse. Tremors (Ron Underwood, 1990) 11.20pm, BBC1 All is far from ideal in the dusty Nevada desert town of Perfection: people go missing, cars vanish into the earth and there's a corpse up a telegraph pole. Sounds like a scene-setter for a 1950s sci-fi B-movie, and so it is, in spirit. Very funny, but with an edge of menace and a pair of likable leads - Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward - who outwit huge, none too bright, man-eating worms. Thursday November 18 Cornered (Edward Dmytryk, 1945) 1.10pm, BBC2 Hard-boiled thriller with Dick Powell shedding his smooth image to play a vengeance- seeking Canadian airman. He's hunting the collaborator responsible for his French bride's death, and the trail leads from France through Switzerland to Buenos Aires. Shot in stark noir style by Harry Wilde. The Family Man (Brett Ratner, 2000) 8pm, Five There's something of James Stewart in It's A Wonderful Life about Nicolas Cage's character in this Christmassy romantic comedy. Like Stewart, he gets a chance to see how his life might have turned out, waking up on Christmas morning transformed from a phenomenally wealthy Wall Street banker into a tyre salesman with wife, kids and a dog. Cage is great fun, and it would be Scrooge-like to begrudge the crowd-pleasing, have-your-cake-and-eat-it finale. 28 Days (Betty Thomas, 2000) 10.25pm, Five Sandra Bullock's Gwen has a drink problem. You can tell because after a few shots she hijacks and crashes a car at her sister's wedding. So it's off to rehab for her, to get on the wagon and become a less selfish person under the supervision of Steve Buscemi. Bullock is as charming as ever. Sex And Lucia (Julio Medem, 2001) 11.05pm, C4 Another heated tango around love and sex from Medem, director of The Lovers Of The Arctic Circle. Paz Vega is Lucia, a waitress who falls for blocked novelist Lorenzo (Trist\u00e1n Ulloa); when she hears of his sudden death, she flees to an exotic Mediterranean island where she meets scuba-diver Carlos (Daniel Freire) and Elena (Najwa Nimri), the mother of Lorenzo's daughter. The plot switches mysteriously, but don't be put off: this is a big, beautiful, sexy movie. Friday November 19 Trapped (Luis Mandoki, 2002) 10pm, Five Kevin Bacon's cold-and-scary extortionist, wife Courtney Love and dim henchman Pruitt Taylor Vince snatch the child of the wonderful Jennings couple (Charlize Theron, Stuart Townsend), who have 24 hours to stump up the cash. Starts edgy and promising but deteriorates: Bacon, though, sizzles all the way through."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
