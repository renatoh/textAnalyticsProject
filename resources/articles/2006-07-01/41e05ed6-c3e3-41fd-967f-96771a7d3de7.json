So I hope I can reassure him that David Cameron's Conservative party does not want to see a \"development free-for-all\". We certainly believe there is a need for more housing, not least to address the gap between the growth in new households being formed and the lag in homes being built to accommodate them. As Max, the CPRE and Elinor Goodman's Affordable Rural Housing Commission have noted, there is a need to provide more affordable rural housing. But we are not marching in lockstep with the government. We oppose its centralised, top-down approach to planning and would give local communities more power to shape development. We particularly want to see environmentally valuable green space, in both our urban and rural areas, protected. Which is why we have been campaigning against centralised government targets for housing density that have contributed to the loss of public space in our cities. The Policy Exchange reports which Max refers to make the case for more local control of planning, greener cities and steps to tackle pressing housing need. Those are aspirations worth celebrating. Michael Gove MP Shadow minister for housing and planning I will resist calling Max Hastings a Nimby, but he is defiantly guilty of apocalyptic thinking. Even if you don't accept Kate Barker's estimate that if all the proposed additional homes were built in the south-east, which has never been the plan, we would still only use less than 1% of total land in that region, it is hard to find a serious argument that supports the claim that our countryside will soon be covered in concrete. Moreover it is indisputable that the rapid rate of house-price inflation is fuelled by a failure to build. And when this is applied to social housing, the consequence is 130,000 homeless children and thousands more trapped in severe overcrowding. Building a few thousand more homes a year won't mean the end for our countryside, but it will mean a brighter future for these children. Adam Sampson Director, Shelter Max Hastings, president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, has certainly protected the countryside from concrete. However, in doing this the CPRE has over the past 50 years abolished the English peasant. Any rural house with a few acres of land now costs in excess of half a million. Enjoy your beautiful but sterile countryside, Max, but none but the well off can now live there. Theo Hopkins Lifton Devon The community buy-out of Fordhall farm by the 5,500 members of Fordhall Community Land Initiative is as significant for England as the 1996 Isle of Eigg community buy-out was for Scotland. This sparked the 2003 Scottish Land Reform Act giving the community right to buy, start-up help and the Scottish Land Fund. Fordhall shows English support for community land trusts, which mutualise landholding using cooperative, non-profit models. Mutualising land enables it to be forever affordable to individuals and accessible to the community. Land is taken off the market, rather than privatised. Norman Warner, however, and New Labour, are busy privatising public assets on a massive scale. Health minister John Hutton described the Standish Mutual Care bid for the redundant 32-acre Standish hospital site to David Drew, Stroud's MP, as the \"preferred bid\". But then Warner, Hutton's successor, vetoed the community bid. This would have delivered a range of local health services; affordable homes for health staff, kept the site in community land trusteeship and reinvested any surplus. Warner awarded Standish instead to an unnamed private bidder in a secret deal. Isn't it time we mutualised assets for community benefit?
