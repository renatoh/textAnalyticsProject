The body of the two-and-a-half-year-old girl was found at the house in Naylor Court, Dewsbury, by healthcare workers who alerted the police at around 2pm today. Neighbour Janine Barraclough described the girl as \"beautiful with mousey brown hair and blue eyes.\" \"She was a happy kid. You would see her playing in the park,\" she said. A post mortem carried out by a Home Office pathologist is due to be carried out tomorrow to determine how the toddler died. A police spokeswoman said the woman was arrested at the house and that detectives were not looking for anyone else in connection with the death."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
