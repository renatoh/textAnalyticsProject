Fantasy and reality blur, sometimes too confusingly, while real hurts and desires emerge, suggesting this is more than just a game for some players. Lord of the Flies is an obvious touchstone, but this effort isn't etched with the same allegorical shading, nor does it have the emotional richness of Stand by Me or the whimsy or brio of Son of Rambow, the two other great kid-centric films that, like this, aren't necessarily for kids. It doesn't help that some of the acting is drama-school awful, a fault for which the directors should be held more liable than the cast. However, a few youngsters show genuine promise and camera-friendly naturalism, particularly Michael Friend as the damaged lead bully, and Mackenzie Munro as Converse-clad Mata Hari."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
