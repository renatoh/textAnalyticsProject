Both players have been out with hand injuries, Cunningham since May 19 and Long since Saints' defeat by Wigan in the Challenge Cup final on April 27. But while David Waite, Great Britain's Australian coach, is confident that Cunningham will prove his fitness when he returns for Saints against Bradford this Friday, Long's bid for selection at Hull on Thursday week will come too late as the Lions fly out the following morning. Leeds's Ryan Sheridan is therefore set to start at scrum-half in Great Britain's first Test in Sydney for a decade, although Waite stressed Paul Wellens, Kevin Sinfield, Karl Pratt and Cunningham could also fill the position. Pratt is one of two uncapped players in the 19-man squad, while the St Helens centre Martin Gleeson is the surprise inclusion. This time last year he was struggling with Huddersfield at the bottom of the Super League but now finds himself travelling to Australia. Significant omissions include the Wigan veteran Gary Connolly and the Bradford youngsters Leon Pryce and Paul Deacon. Bradford's prop Paul Anderson and Adrian Morley of the Sydney Roosters were ruled out by injury, handing a chance to the young Hull forward Paul King. Great Britain: Radlinski (Wigan), Wellens (St Helens), Pratt (Leeds), Johnson (Wigan), Gleeson (St Helens), Senior (Leeds), Sculthorpe (St Helens), Sinfield (Leeds), Sheridan (Leeds), Cunningham (St Helens), Newton (Wigan), McDermott (Leeds), O'Connor (Wigan), Fielden (Bradford), Peacock (Bradford), Joynt (St Helens), Farrell (Wigan, capt), Gilmour (Bradford), King (Hull)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
