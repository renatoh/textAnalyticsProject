We have both travelled extensively and I can honestly say that Iran is one of the friendliest countries we have visited. Tourists are very welcome, and many people wanted to have their picture taken with us and speak to us about the UK. Nobody threatened us and people went out of their way to help us and be hospitable. So it is astonishing and deeply depressing that the US (possibly supported by our own equally misguided government) could even contemplate waging war on this country. Nobody we met there has any idea they are in danger of being attacked. As well as the crippling trade sanctions that are already in place, there is nothing to be gained from dropping bombs on innocent civilians in Iran. After the lies fed to us during the Iraq invasion, who can trust anything we hear from the US or our own government? Diplomats, journalists and commentators should get out to Iran to see what the country is really like for themselves. I can assure you they would get a very different picture than the one being peddled by the likes of John Bolton and Mike Pompeo in the US. Jonathan Cockburn Hewelsfield, Gloucestershire \u2022 President Trump is undecided how to retaliate for the loss of an American drone shot down by Iranian forces in the Strait of Hormuz. A fair response would be that when there is an Iranian aircraft carrier patrolling up and down the US coast and it releases a drone that gets too close to the US mainland, then the Americans might shoot it down. Until then it would be best if he did nothing.
