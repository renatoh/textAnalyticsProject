The maximum cost will be around \u00a340,000. We are UK residents but not homeowners - we rent privately. We have around \u00a37,000 in savings. What do you think would be the best way to borrow the money to buy the property? A personal loan, or can we get a mortgage for buying abroad? Ideally, we would like to borrow the money in sterling or euros. SL A Using a personal loan to buy property, wherever it is, would be a very expensive way of borrowing the money you need. This is because interest charged on personal loans is typically much higher than the rate you pay on a mortgage. However, because the property you want to buy is outside the UK, you are unlikely to get a mortgage from a UK-based lender, although you might be able to get one in Algeria. However, rather than approaching lenders direct it might be sensible to make use of the services of an overseas mortgage specialist such as Conti Financial Services who also give advice on the foreign buying process."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
