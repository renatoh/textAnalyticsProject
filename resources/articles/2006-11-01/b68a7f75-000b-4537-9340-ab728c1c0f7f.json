The publisher of the world's best-selling magazine responded to a long-term decline in circulation by agreeing to the takeover by the $10bn private equity outfit. Although its magazine circulates to 18 million people in 21 languages, the business has struggled to appeal to the younger readers prized by advertisers. Ripplewood's chief executive, Tim Collins, said Reader's Digest fans were always going to want high quality content and good ideas, but the way they want to read them might change. \"Reader's Digest is exceedingly well positioned to be a leader in that transition,\" he said. The deal ends 16 years on the New York Stock Exchange for the Reader's Digest Association, which has its origins in an idea by a New York couple, DeWitt and Lila Wallace, who began producing a condensed version of articles from popular periodicals in 1922. \u00b7 Email business.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
