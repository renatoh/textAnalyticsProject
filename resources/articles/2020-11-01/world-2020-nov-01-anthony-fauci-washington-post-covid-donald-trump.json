All the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors. You could not possibly be positioned more poorly.\u201d More than 9.1m cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in the US and more than 230,000 people have died. Daily case counts vary but agree that on Friday the US set a world record for cases in a single day, between 99,000 and 100,000, as numbers surge in several states, many of them electoral battlegrounds key to control of the White House. On Saturday, Johns Hopkins University reported more than 81,000 new cases. There were 862 deaths, down from more than 1,000 the day before. Donald Trump, recently recovered from the virus himself, continues to campaign for re-election, staging rallies at which mitigation strategies such as mask-wearing and social distancing are not observed and regularly claiming the US is \u201crounding the corner\u201d. On Friday he made the baseless claim that doctors are rewarded financially if people die of Covid. His challenger, Joe Biden, who leads most national and battleground state polls, is staging fewer events and observing Covid protocols. Trump has charged that Biden is \u201chiding\u201d and regularly mocked his opponent for wearing a mask. On Sunday, campaign adviser Anita Dunn told CNN\u2019s State of the Union that since March, \u201cwhat Vice-President Biden has done is basically why he\u2019s got in this race, he showed people what a responsible president does and how a responsible president acts.\u201d Fauci told the Post that Biden was \u201ctaking it seriously from a public health perspective\u201d. Trump, he said, was \u201clooking at it from a different perspective \u2026 the economy and reopening the country.\u201d Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, told the Post that Trump \u201calways put the well-being of the American people first\u201d, and added: \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable and breaking with all norms for Dr Fauci, a senior member of the president\u2019s coronavirus taskforce and someone who has praised President Trump\u2019s actions throughout this pandemic, to choose three days before an election to play politics.\u201d In fact Fauci has often clashed with Trump, and recently complained about comments being used out of context in a campaign commercial. Fauci, 79, has been director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, serving six presidents. He is immensely popular with the public and largely seen as safe from being fired. But the Post also reported that \u201cat one point during the interview, Fauci said he needed to be careful with his words because he would be blocked from doing appearances in the future\u201d. Deere said that \u201cas a member of the Task Force, Dr Fauci has a duty to express concerns or push for a change in strategy, but he\u2019s not done that, instead choosing to criticise the president in the media and make his political leanings known by praising the president\u2019s opponent \u2013 exactly what the American people have come to expect from the Swamp.\u201d Public records show Fauci is not registered as a Democrat or a Republican. \u201cThe Swamp\u201d is Trump campaign speak for Washington, supposedly a den of \u201cdeep state\u201d bureaucrats and intelligence officials dedicated to thwarting the president and feathering their own nests. Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Steve Bannon, a key propagator of the deep state theory now indicted for fraud, has said it is \u201cfor nut cases\u201d. Speaking to the Post, Fauci was critical of a controversial outsider brought into the coronavirus taskforce by Trump. Scott Atlas, a Stanford neuroradiologist and Fox News contributor, favours ending public health restrictions and pursuing \u201cherd immunity\u201d. \u201cI have real problems with that guy,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cHe\u2019s a smart guy who\u2019s talking about things that I believe he doesn\u2019t have any real insight or knowledge or experience in. He keeps talking about things that when you dissect it out and parse it out, it doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d On Saturday, Atlas promoted an interview with RT \u2013 a Kremlin-controlled TV channel which spreads disinformation. \u201cLockdowns, facts, frauds,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIf you can\u2019t handle truth, use a mask to cover your eyes and ears.\u201d On Sunday he apologised for the interview, saying he was unaware RT was \u201ca registered foreign agent\u201d. Fauci also said: \u201cRight now, the public health aspect of the [White House] taskforce has diminished greatly \u2026 the last time I spoke to the president was not about any policy. It was when he was recovering in Walter Reed, he called me up.\u201d Fauci said he called into meetings but largely avoided the White House because \u201cof all the infections there\u201d. After an event for supreme court nominee Amy Coney Barrett on 26 September, cases proliferated among the Trump family, senior aides and top Republicans. Last weekend, senior aides to Vice-President Mike Pence were infected. Fauci also addressed controversial remarks last weekend by White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who said the administration was not going to control the pandemic. \u201cI tip my hat to him for admitting the strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is straightforward in telling you what\u2019s on his mind. I commend him for that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
