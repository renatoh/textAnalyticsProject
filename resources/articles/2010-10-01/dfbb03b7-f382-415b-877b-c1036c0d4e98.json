The name of Utley, a more-than-respectable fifth in Group One company at Longchamp last Sunday, comes from close to home for the colt's American owner George Strawbridge. The Campbell's soup heir, a resident of Pennsylvania, was born in Philadelphia where Chase Utley is a major player in the city's baseball team, the Phillies.
