We apologise for any inconvenience that has been caused.\" Let's just hope the Ukrainian people appreciate the enormous sacrifices the British have made in putting back the second reading of the HS2 bill to make way for the foreign secretary's urgent statement on the situation in their country. \"Russia is already paying a serious price for its actions,\" William Hague assured the house, the extra helium in his cheese-grater voice an indication of his own gravity. Unfortunately, the Russians aren't yet quite aware of the effect the tough British sanctions have had on them, so Hague was reluctantly having to announce that he was extending the visa ban to prevent another dozen or so Russian oligarchs from shopping in Bond Street. Both Sir Nicholas Soames and Sir Gerald Howarth put in a plea for Nato to take a more robust response, but Hague \u2013 understandably reluctant to declare war on Russia \u2013 was insistent that his calibrated response was the right one and that he had further, third-tier sanctions up his sleeve if needed. He wasn't, though, prepared to say what these sanctions might be because if \"I set out a red line then the Russians would go right up to it\". Some might think they have already long gone past it, but Hague is a forgiving sort. \"I don't think the Russians have thought through the long-term consequences of their actions,\" he added. Douglas Alexander, shadow foreign secretary, nodded his agreement. There was a similar cross-party consensus when the HS2 debate finally got under way. With Labour having already promised to back the bill, the Conservatives could be generous to their home counties MPs who aren't too keen on having a new rail track in their constituents' back gardens. \"You've been overdoing it a bit,\" some whips had advised. \"Take an extra day off with your family and come back to work on Tuesday.\" It was an offer that some had been pleased to take up, judging by the large gaps on the back \u2013 and front \u2013 benches. Three government ministers had already been given permission to abstain on the vote. The hardcore refuseniks, Cheryl Gillan and Michael Fabricant, were not so easily placated and instead were treated with huge understanding \u2013 some might call it killing with kindness \u2013 as if they were beacons of democracy rather than irritants. Not that the bill wasn't subject to its own delays as the transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, was subject to constant interruptions. Would the train be stopping at Stoke? Was Stoke in the west Midlands? McLoughlin took everything in his stride. Then well he might, as he will seldom have an easier day in the house. He told the Commons that HS2 was actually about capacity not speed \u2013 in which case it should perhaps be renamed HC2 \u2013 and that even if it didn't stop at Stoke, which he wasn't ruling out, the people of Stoke would get huge benefits from travelling on much emptier slow trains. At least that was his subtext. But no one was paying too much attention to the details. The third reading of the bill won't take place this year. Or even necessarily next. Put it down to further delays on the line."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
