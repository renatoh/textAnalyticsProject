While each ingredient in the burger is suitable for vegetarians, the company has said, the patty \u2013 which is crumbed and contains mixed vegetables and cheese \u2013 is fried with the same equipment used by McDonald\u2019s to cook chicken, so \u201cmay not be suitable for all vegetarians\u201d, a spokesman said. \u201cWith the equipment we have available, we have to cook the patty in the same oil used for other products like McChicken patties,\u201d said David Howse, the general manager for McDonald\u2019s New Zealand. \u201cThis product is intended for flexitarians, rather than being vegan or vegetarian, but for some vegetarians our preparation method will be OK.\u201d New Zealanders are increasingly willing to consider eating less meat, according to recent research. In October the polling firm Colmar Brunton said 34% of New Zealanders were reducing their meat consumption or avoiding it entirely. While the trend for meat eaters to adopt a more \u201cflexitarian\u201d diet was promising, said the New Zealand Vegetarian Society, the offer of a vegetable burger that wasn\u2019t quite vegetarian represented a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d. \u201cThe sense that we get from reactions on Facebook posts is that most vegetarians aren\u2019t going to want to eat this,\u201d said Philip McKibbin, a spokesman for the society. \u201cSome won\u2019t have a problem that it\u2019s cooked in the same oil as chicken is, but a lot of vegetarians who are following a vegetarian diet for animal welfare reasons are going to have a problem with it.\u201d He added that he was pleased to see that more plant-based options were available and the vegetable-based burger was \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d. The McVeggie was also trialled in Australia this year with the same warning. Other fast food companies have been criticised for failing to take a more cautious approach to promoting their plant-based products. In November a Florida man filed a suit against Burger King because workers had cooked his vegan burger on the same grill used for meat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
