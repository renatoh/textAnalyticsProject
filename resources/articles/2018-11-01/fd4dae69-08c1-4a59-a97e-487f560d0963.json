Farrell got away with leading with his shoulder at the end of the game this month against South Africa, an act that a meeting of referees and coaches the following week concluded should have been a penalty. He was penalised on Saturday when he barged into the Australia second-row Izack Rodda on England\u2019s line to prevent a try but the Wallabies, who were trailing 13-10, argued for a penalty try and a yellow card. \u201cIf the challenge against South Africa was worth a penalty, this one should have been three,\u201d said Cheika. \u201cFor the referee to say our player shoulder-charged Farrell is ridiculous. I count that as one of three tries we had disallowed and I do not know why it was not reviewed. \u201cWhen we met the referees after England\u2019s game against South Africa, we were told Farrell\u2019s challenge should have been a penalty. I have not spoken to the referee because it is what it is and there is no point. It does not take away from the fact that England were the better team and deserved to win. We kicked too much.\u201d Eddie Jones refused to be drawn on the subject. \u201cWhy talk to me about Michael Cheika?\u201d the England coach said. \u201cYou guys love the television match official. I don\u2019t: I just accept his decisions.\u201d The victory was England\u2019s third in four matches this month and the defeat, to New Zealand, was by one point after a review scratched Sam Underhill\u2019s try five minutes from the end. It meant England finished the year with a 50% record having lost five successive matches at one point. Their next match is in Dublin at the start of the Six Nations, prompting Jones to take aim at Ireland. \u201cWe are looking forward to it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can be the best team now and not win the World Cup. We want to be at our best during the World Cup: there is no such thing as momentum going into it. \u201cWe had a tough Six Nations and had to regroup, which we did in South Africa in the summer. \u201cWe lost the series but we achieved togetherness. This month was a step forward, as the Six Nations will be. We will get better at what we do well at. This was a performance based on the traditions of English rugby, scrum, lineout and maul, which allowed us to attack. \u201cWe were without a number of players today and we have developed competition.\u201d Prop Kyle Sinckler was named man of the match for his presence in the scrum and the loose to cap an impressive month. He said: \u201cIt was a good win, but we are striving for an 80-minute performance. If we want to be considered a very good side, we have to keep up the intensity throughout.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
