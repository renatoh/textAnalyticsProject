Northern Territory police arrested the suspected shooter, described as a Caucasian man aged 45, wearing high-vis workwear, on Tuesday night. He remained in hospital under police guard on Wednesday. Police said the suspected shooter was \u201cwell known to police\u201d and may have had links to motorcycle gangs. He had been released on parole in January and was wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet. Witnesses have described scenes of panic and carnage throughout the city as the gunman moved from scene to scene. The first reports of a man firing shots came at the Palms Motel just outside the Darwin city centre about 5.50pm. A man was killed at the motel before three other deaths occurred at the nearby Buff Club, Gardens Hill Crescent and an industrial site at Jolly Street in the suburb of Woolner. Jasmine Kielly and her partner, Brendon Ozanne, told the ABC they were staying at the Palms Motel after moving to Darwin only a week ago. \u201cI heard some loud banging \u2013 silly me went out the front to check,\u201d Kielly told the ABC. \u201cAs I\u2019ve gone down towards the stairs, I saw a man in a high-vis shirt walk out with a rifle. \u201cHe\u2019s turned to look at me and I\u2019ve run to the bedroom and locked the door and we hid in the bathroom and we called the police and just heard shot after shot after shot.\u201d Another witness, John Rose, told the ABC he had seen a man walk into the motel with a \u201csawn-off shotgun\u201d. \u201cHe shot up all the rooms and he went to every room looking for somebody and he shot them all up. Then we saw him rush out, jump into his Toyota pick-up, and rush off.\u201d While police have not yet detailed the gunman\u2019s exact movements, the shooting continued at the Gardens, an inner-city suburb in Darwin, where another man was killed and a woman was injured. A witness told the NT News she had been on the phone to the police when she saw the alleged gunman flee the scene. \u201cI was on the phone with the police and I said, \u2018He\u2019s gone right towards the Gardens,\u2019 and I just said that and the cops come and chased him that way,\u201d she said. Another Darwin resident, Matthew James, told Nine\u2019s Today program he had been standing in the car park of a motel when \u201call of a sudden there were these gunshots\u201d. \u201cMoments later someone came running towards me carrying this woman who was covered in blood and just basically put her at my feet and she was screaming that she had been shot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe guy that actually carried her up was pretty frantic at the time, saying he had opened the door and there was a gunman there with a shotgun and he proceeded to fire upon anybody inside the building. \u201cShe was caught up in it, she said, \u2018I\u2019ve been shot, I don\u2019t know why, I don\u2019t have anything to do with anything,\u2019\u201d he said. Witnesses described a fight breaking out at the Buffalo Club car park, where a man was believed to have died after a fight involving a knife and gun. The pub reportedly stayed open after the shooting. Another crime scene was established at an industrial site on Jolly Street in the suburb of Woolner. Johnny Reid was watching television at his worksite at about 6pm when the door of the unit he was sitting in was was knocked down by a man holding a shotgun, the NT News reports. \u201cHe busted in and looked right at me,\u201d he told the NT News. \u201cI looked at him and thought, \u2018Fuck, this is it.\u2019 I thought I was dead for sure. \u201cI asked him what he was doing but he went right past me and shot my mate. His body is still in there.\u201d The man was arrested after calling NT police and trying to enter police headquarters in what the police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, said on Tuesday may have been an attempt to hand himself in. Kershaw would not speculate on the man\u2019s motive on Tuesday but said it had not been a terrorist attack and that the shooter had \u201cacted individually\u201d. \u201cHe is an individual who is well known to police and has a number of interactions adverse with the police force, so he is well known to us,\u201d he said. \u201cI did speak this evening with the corrections commissioner; my information is around January of this year he was released on parole.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
