The billionaire founder of the Virgin empire \u2013 who does not have the right to vote in the UK \u2013 is launching the campaign on Monday. He lives in the British Virgin Islands but pointed out that the Virgin businesses, which span financial services and gyms, employ 50,000 people in the UK. Branson said: \u201cAs an entrepreneur I have been known for taking risks throughout my career, but leaving the European Union is not one of the risks I would want the UK to take \u2013 not as an investor, not as a father and not as a grandfather. I am deeply concerned about the impact of leaving.\u201d He has registered his campaign with the Electoral Commission, which suggests he intends to spend more than \u00a310,000 on his efforts to win support for the remain side. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve been living in the British Virgin Islands for some time now, I have never stopped caring passionately about the UK and its great people,\u201d Branson said. He also pointed to other benefits of the EU, saying: \u201cMy father Ted fought in North Africa, Italy and Germany during world war two. My grandfather survived the horrors of the trenches in world war one. I truly believe that one of the EU\u2019s greatest achievements is that it has kept its members out of conflict in Europe.\u201d The business community is not unanimous on remaining in the EU, however, with 37 pro-Brexit business leaders writing in the Sun on Sunday to say the country can survive outside the \u201cenergy-sapping\u201d European project. A Virgin spokesperson said: \u201cRichard has lived overseas for some years and so he\u2019s not on the electoral register. Richard\u2019s children and grandchildren live in the UK and clearly as an investor Richard has interests in the UK, with Virgin businesses employing over 50,000 people. Richard is urging every single one of them to vote in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
