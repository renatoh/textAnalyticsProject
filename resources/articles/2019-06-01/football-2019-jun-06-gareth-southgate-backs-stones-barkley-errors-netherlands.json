Sloppy mistakes in the added half-hour, with England still struggling to recover from the VAR ruling out a potential winner from Jesse Lingard for offside, cost Southgate\u2019s team a Nations League defeat that bore similarities to the outcome against Croatia in the last four at the 2018 World Cup. A half-time lead had been surrendered again, with the Dutch dominating the ball and eventually capitalising on cataclysmic defensive mistakes. Kyle Walker\u2019s own goal after Stones \u2013 one Premier League start since the first week in April \u2013 was caught in possession by Memphis Depay, then Barkley\u2019s poorly placed back-pass, ensured England ended up conceding three goals in a competitive match for the first time since losing 4-1 to Germany in Bloemfontein at the 2010 World Cup. \u201cWe have to play out better, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a case of stopping what we are doing,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThe Dutch pressed really well, and we weren\u2019t quite as sharp in some of our decision making. \u201cI\u2019m asking my defenders to play in a way that puts them under huge pressure at the back. If we didn\u2019t play that way, we wouldn\u2019t have got to the semi-finals we\u2019ve got to in the last year, and we\u2019d never progress to being a top team. But we made too many mistakes in our final third, partly as a result of their pressure but also by errors by us. When you\u2019re fatigued mistakes happen and the mistakes were from passes our players can play with no problem. \u201cI have to support John because he\u2019ll get horrible criticism for that mistake but he and Harry Maguire take huge strain on their shoulders and are incredibly courageous to do that. We didn\u2019t lose because of how we want to play. The errors were uncharacteristic really, and not errors we\u2019d normally make. It wasn\u2019t risk. It was poor execution and fatigue, certainly with the last one, because Ross had just gone down with cramp moments before. \u201cWe have some players who, at the end of the season, found it difficult in terms of the amount of minutes they were getting on the pitch, and others who experienced the complete opposite. \u201cI think fatigue has played a part, as well as a lack of match sharpness. I can\u2019t overreact. I have to support them in what is a difficult moment for everybody. This is incredibly painful for my players but we\u2019ll be stronger for our experiences.\u201d Southgate accepted the decision to disallow Lingard\u2019s late goal as \u201cfine margins\u201d but it deflated England at a moment when their energy was running low\u201d. \u201cWe thought it was going to be a winner but things didn\u2019t go our way,\u201d said Harry Kane, one of the squad\u2019s seven Champions League finalists who started the match on the bench. \u201cWe know we made mistakes, sloppy mistakes giving the ball away, but that\u2019s part of learning as a team. \u201cWe take that on the chin because that\u2019s the way we want to play. We\u2019re disappointed but every disappointment we have to learn from and get better.\u201d Southgate was quick to condemn those travelling supporters who had caused mayhem on the streets of nearby Porto on Wednesday night. \u201cThe saddest thing for me is we have thousands upon thousands of fans who come here and support us brilliantly, and have the ability to enjoy themselves without causing offence to anyone or creating problems wherever they go, and then we have a group who are an embarrassment,\u201d he said, echoing the Football Association\u2019s statement from earlier in the day. \u201cAs an Englishman, they\u2019re not supporters of the team. They reflect so poorly on us as a country. We don\u2019t associate ourselves with them at all.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
