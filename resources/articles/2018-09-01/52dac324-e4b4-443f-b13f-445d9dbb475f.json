They have identified 196 distinct camps \u2013 sites where, over 50 years, the native police were based while they ranged out to \u201cdisperse\u201d Aboriginal people and escort surveyors, pastoralists and prospectors further inland and further north. \u201cOut on patrol, that\u2019s where violence would happen,\u201d Heather Burke, an associate professor from Flinders University, told Guardian Australia. A stone structure at a native police camp on the Burke River, outside Boulia in central Queensland \u201cWhat we\u2019re finding on the ground is the day-to-day material, the detritus of daily life: ceramics, buttons, cartridges. Really ordinary prosaic things,\u201d Burke said. \u201cBut you have to look at what that ordinariness obscures. The reason they\u2019re there is to support this broad, statewide system of removing any kind of Aboriginal resistance to European expansion. Rather than just looking at it and saying it\u2019s just like any other site, it\u2019s about how that system could function so successfully,\u201d she said. \u201cBy successful, what I mean is that it allowed them to kill more people.\u201d The native police were a state-sanctioned paramilitary organisation with groups of Aboriginal troopers under the leadership of a white officer. Historians say troopers were survivors of massacres from their own lands in other parts of the country, recruited by coercion, intimidation, kidnapping and inducement, as well as voluntary enlistment. L-R The base of a pin fire cartridge, commonly used in breechloading revolvers of the late 1800s, found at Eyre Creek in the channel country; buttons from the uniforms of native police found at a camp at Mistake Creek, central Queensland. Frontier killings across Queensland were systematic but predominantly of small groups at scattered locations. Archaeologists cannot detect those isolated sites using the usual methods. So, they hit upon the idea of locating native police camps instead. \u201cThe native police proved to be far more interesting than even we knew at the time,\u201d Burke said. \u201cWe found descendants of troopers and the survivors of massacres in the same community, even the same family.\u201d Firsthand accounts from the troopers themselves are absent from the historical record, but the stories told by their descendants form a \u201ccomplex emotional mosaic\u201d. \u201cIt gets really human and fraught and I never expected that. The knowledge of family involvement in this history can split a family. Some are OK to say they\u2019re descended from that man, other parts refuse to acknowledge. It can cause ongoing issues. Clockwise from top: A bullet from a Snider-Enfield rifle and the base of a stoneware meat paste jar, both found at Peak Downs native police camp, central western Queensland; a \u201cJosephson\u2019s Australian ointment\u201d lid found at Laura, Cape York. Josephson\u2019s billed itself \u201ca quick and instant relief from pain.\u201d \u201cThe more we talk to people, the more it\u2019s clear they want these stories to get out there. Some white landowners say no, you can\u2019t come on my property but we\u2019ve never had any Aboriginal people say no, you can\u2019t tell the stories,\u201d Burke said. The more they dig, the more complex the history becomes. \u201cSome of the really interesting patterns are in those places where we know there was more than one camp over a period of time. Some camps lasted 10 or 20 years, some only one or two years. \u201cThat tells you how much a police presence was needed to facilitate settlement. At Palmer River on Cape York, they had to have repeated camps coming back into the area, because Aboriginal people weren\u2019t \u2018pacified\u2019. \u201cThey had areas where they could retreat, mountainous areas, where they couldn\u2019t be followed, where they could hide well. \u201cBut in western Queensland, there were never those sorts of areas. You get a different pattern of peoples\u2019 abilities to resist that force, and you can see that if you plot where the camps are and when the camps are,\u201d Burke said.

Archaeologists are finding domestic debris: bits of pots and plates, occasionally shards of bone, to build a picture of daily life. \u201cWe know there were women and children in those camps as well,\u201d Burke said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to understand how a unit of native police worked, the demarcation between troopers and white officers, the class division. Dr Lynley Wallis from the University of Notre Dame, looking at a carte de visite photograph collection of officers and troopers at John Oxley library in Brisbane. \u201cWe\u2019re using the debris to work out how they operated as a social structure, their hierarchy and relationships.\u201d Two years in and with two years to go, the team has identified 196 sites, done 30 site visits, and excavated at four. Pinpointing the right place to look requires \u201ca lot of archival research,\u201d Burke said. \u201cWe\u2019ve accessed seven and a half thousand documents from Queensland state archives \u2013 old maps, any primary sources we can find \u2013 and then we go and talk to people on the ground, historical societies, land owners, Aboriginal communities to try and identify as many places as possible. \u201cThen we go out and walk the country. If we think the camp is somewhere in a region, we might walk a five kilometre square to try and find it. And we might do that two or three times, just so we can actually locate it. It takes a long time. \u201cWe go out and walk the country.\u201d Excavations from above at Burke River, near Boulia in southwest Queensland, Australia. The names of waterholes, mountains and other landmarks can reveal what happened there. \u201cYou go to a site called \u2018Murdering Lagoon\u2019 and that has a story attached to it, of a massacre of course. Not all place names are about killing Aboriginal people but one of the things about the topography of Australia is that there are lots of names like that and you wouldn\u2019t ignore that.\u201d The project winds up in 2020 with a plan to make public as much information as possible, and in the hope that the sites will be seen as worth preserving. \u201cNative police camps are almost always known at the local level by historical societies and passionate local historians, but none of them are listed on the state heritage resister,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThere\u2019s a long history of the state not wanting to acknowledge that it was a state sponsored act. A petition from the lessees of crown lands in the districts of Kennedy north and Cook to the Commissioner of Police in Brisbane, seeking native police reinforcement because \u201cthe depredations by the blacks on our stock are excessive\u201d. \u201cThe history of the native police is so complex. It\u2019s not just a black and white thing. People need to put together the parts of the story themselves, to figure out what they feel about it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
