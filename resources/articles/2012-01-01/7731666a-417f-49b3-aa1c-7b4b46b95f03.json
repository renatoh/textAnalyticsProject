But the questions are about a Super Secret Halloween party thrown by the White House in 2009. He attended in character as the Mad Hatter \u2013 no word as to whether the Tea Party is claiming his presence a victory for the movement. As to the coverup, the Obamas were apparently counting on the general apathy of the public toward its Flickr feed and news reports in order to keep it under wraps. Though it's true that Depp's attendance was not advertised, and I suspect that the White House was happy about that at the time. Reporters and Republicans making the minor fuss about this party don't have bad instincts, though. To the extent that the event can stick to the president, it's because the juxtaposition of lavish party/bad economy puts another brick in the argument that Obama isn't just out of touch with Americans, but arrogant about his detachment. Political attacks only work if they hook into what voters already believe: Newt is an anger-bomb, Ron Paul is an irritable isolationist, Rick Santorum is a dweeby bedroom-policeman, Mitt Romney is a computer from the future sent to eliminate the need for humans. When these attitudes mesh with actual policies, the narrative solidifies beyond what real-time events and information have the power to change. So, you know, Alice in Wonderland-themed parties \u2013 just the beginning of our trip down the rabbit hole."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
