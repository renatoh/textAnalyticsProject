Having spent her entire biking career as a privateer, the first woman to race in the championships was recently signed by Honda in a life\u2011changing deal. Tinmouth, who worked alongside Tom Cruise as a stunt double for the actor Rebecca Ferguson in the forthcoming Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation, holds several world records to her name as a pioneering female in motorsport but has often struggled to pay the bills to keep her bike on the track. Last season Tinmouth had to drop out of the championship, three rounds before the conclusion, because she ran out of money. It was not the first time she had dealt with such financial struggles \u2013 recalling her toughest year in 2005 when she could not even afford the fuel to race. \u201cI\u2019ve spent all I\u2019ve ever earned on motorbike racing,\u201d says Tinmouth, who works from Monday to Friday as a mechanic. \u201cI don\u2019t earn a wage riding, unfortunately, but that still goes for most of the paddock.\u201d This lack of wages is nothing new to the racer who also still lives at home for financial reasons. \u201cI\u2019ve begged and borrowed everything to do this. For the first five years of racing I never had new tyres, I\u2019d just get old tyres off the scrap pile. I bought my first set of leathers secondhand off a guy at college for 50 quid. Whatever money I had went on entry fees to races and my fuel. I just really wanted to do it even though I didn\u2019t have enough money to do it properly.\u201d Her presence in the BSB the last three years is something of a miracle, with Tinmouth estimating that most teams spend anything from \u00a3500,000 to \u00a32m per year. \u201cI spent more like \u00a330,000 \u2013 I probably had the smallest budget of all the teams on the grid.\u201d Tinmouth, who grew up watching Ayrton Senna and Damon Hill in Formula One, caught the bike bug when, at the age of six, her dad stuck her on a bike with him one bank holiday weekend and the pair \u201cpottered\u201d around a field. By 14 she was allowed to steer the bike herself, a ritual element of the family\u2019s annual trip to a classic bike show. \u201cI loved it, a bank holiday August weekend away, 500 classic bikes \u2026 I loved the atmosphere, the noise of the bikes, the smell and sitting on a bike in awe of the whole thing.\u201d At 17 she bought a 125cc bike to commute to college, and began competing, at the age of 20, in club races, eventually graduating to the British Championships in 2003. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the funds to run a bigger bike at that time, it took me a while to make that jump. I was chasing the dream of getting into Superbikes for years, then I had a really good 2010, getting the [fastest woman] record at the Isle of Man TT race and finishing third in the British Supersport club championship.\u201d Tinmouth reached the BSB the following year, but the step up brought increased financial pressure. The Honda deal, when it came, was a relief. In a sport where \u2013 refreshingly \u2013 there are no rules on women competing against men, Tinmouth says she has never encountered sexism. \u201cI get asked that a lot, but no, absolutely none. Motorcycling is really friendly, there\u2019s a real camaraderie. I think we\u2019re ahead of the time in that sense [compared with other sports].\u201d How do her male competitors react if she beats them? \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. I remember one race I had, the first time I had four points in the British championship, I finished 10th. This guy was right on my tail the entire race \u2013 he saw me hold on to my slide at one of the corners and I beat him. Afterwards he came over, shook my hand and said well done. I\u2019ll never forget that. It\u2019s something you always want, to gain the respect of your competitors.\u201d The Honda contract further serves to boost her reputation in a one-year deal that Tinmouth says was decided \u201con merit\u201d. The new set-up will take some getting used to, however \u2013 she has worked alone up until now, but at Honda her garage will now include a manager, two mechanics, a crew chief and specialists for both brakes and suspension. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big operation. It takes a lot of burden off my shoulders so it\u2019s really good because I can just think about riding, I don\u2019t have to think about anything else.\u201d With a best-ever BSB finish of 15th the first woman to win a point in the championship hopes this new era will enable her to break into the top 10 and make an even bigger impact on her sport.
