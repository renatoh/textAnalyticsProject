For three years in opposition they had paged, typed, phoned and faxed their boss to victory. Naturally the new prime minister wanted this able and predominantly young team of advisers with him in Downing Street. Four years on, Mr Blair now realises that if his Labour government is to deliver real change he is going to have to bring in some more experienced heads. That's why he has turned to Lord Birt to play a leading role in his new forward strategy unit as a part time \"strategic adviser\". This appointment will be derided by those in the BBC who Lord Birt took on during his time as director general from 1992 to 2000. However, it will not be a surprise. His failings have been well documented: a lack of appreciation of creative talent, unwilling to address poor staff morale, ruthless cost cutting and an over reliance on management consultants. But these criticisms fail to acknowledge the legacy which he has left the BBC: online and digital services which are second to none, giving producers a greater say over how they spend their budgets, supporting initiatives to introduce a larger pool of independent programme makers, shaking up an unwieldy and inefficient bureaucracy, and preserving core services in the face of a hostile anti-BBC Conservative government. It is these successes which Mr Blair will want to draw on as he looks to develop serious plans to improve public services. The prime minister after all needs no lessons on how to become unpopular with the chattering classes. The prime minister has known Lord Birt for a number of years, principally through their mutual friend, Peter Mandelson. While at the BBC, Lord Birt ensured that his contacts with the new Labour establishment were social rather than professional . That changed when Greg Dyke took over the reins at the BBC. Since then Lord Birt has completed one significant piece of work for Blair, an analysis of crime in Britain. The prime minister, something of a crime expert having made his name as shadow home secretary, described the report privately as \"the best of its kind\" that he had seen. This document is now forming the basis for much of David Blunkett's new thinking as he seeks to shake up the Home Office after the departure of the more managerial and less visionary Jack Straw. As Lord Birt takes up his desk in Downing Street he will analyse in minute detail the challenges he faces. Everything will be mapped out by hand and line by line. As a former colleague said this morning, \"he is a brilliant technocrat, and what's wrong with that. It's exactly what Downing Street needs.\" He will take up the prime minister's election mantra focussing on \"schools and hospitals first\" before moving on to transport and the environment. This approach will be different to the energetic and imaginative, though less experienced and methodical approach of Mr Blair's existing advisers. Lord Birt has also been given a mandate to bring in other outsiders to work with him on particular projects, these experts will have respected backgrounds and base their judgements on industry experience not instinct. Their reports will form the basis of the prime minister's proposals to improve specific aspects of departmental policy. There is another factor behind Blair's decision to introduce senior figures into his personal staff. The reason, as ever when it comes to new Labour internal politics, is the brooding chancellor running the Treasury a few hundred yards down Whitehall. While Tony Blair was still enjoying his post 1997 election honeymoon, Mr Brown was beavering away in the Treasury setting up many of the structures which have made him the most powerful and (until now) successful chancellor since the war. Mr Blair failed to recognise the speed which Mr Brown grasped the levers of power in government. He is now slowly and successfully clawing back some of that influence to ensure that his administration is run in the interest of every Whitehall department. And while they might both deny it, Lord Birt and Mr Brown have many similar qualities - an astonishing appetite for hard work, a loyal collection of supporters and a controversial reputation. If Mr Blair is to come up successfully with ideas and administrative structures which are going to deliver what he wants in Whitehall then there is no better person to come up with a plan than Lord Birt.
