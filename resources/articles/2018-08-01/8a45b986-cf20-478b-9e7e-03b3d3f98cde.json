Rowley\u2019s older brother, Matthew, claimed that Charlie had been \u201cknocked sideways\u201d by the development, which comes a month after he was discharged from Salisbury district hospital following treatment for the effects of the nerve agent poisoning. The hospital said it could not speak about individual cases but stressed it was not treating anyone for the effects of novichok poisoning at the moment. Charlie\u2019s partner, Dawn Sturgess, died after being exposed to novichok apparently contained in a perfume bottle that he had found. Matthew Rowley said on Monday that his brother was taken to hospital at the weekend and his vision remained impaired. He told the Guardian: \u201cHe\u2019s just told me now he can\u2019t see, he has blurred vision. It\u2019s not too good. He\u2019s been knocked sideways. His girlfriend has died, he\u2019s just got out of a coma. He\u2019s been released from an intensive care unit and all of a sudden he\u2019s back in an IC unit. Can you imagine how you would feel? I can\u2019t, it\u2019s unbelievable. \u201cI got a phone call from his friend to tell me he was really ill. The hospital told me he had been admitted with problems.\u201d Matthew Rowley said he did not know if his brother\u2019s current treatment was related to the poisoning. \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor. I can\u2019t say. I don\u2019t want to cause panic. But it\u2019s pretty coincidental. It\u2019s pretty close together. I\u2019ve only got one younger brother. If I lose him I haven\u2019t got anyone. He sounds quite distant on the phone. He sounded quite elusive, not really making sense. I was trying to ask him about stuff but couldn\u2019t get any real information out of him.\u201d Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess fell ill on 30 June in Amesbury, four months after the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, suffered novichok poisoning in Salisbury. A murder investigation is continuing into the death of Sturgess. A spokesman for Salisbury district hospital said: \u201cWe can\u2019t talk about individual cases. We\u2019re not currently treating anyone for nerve agent-related illness.\u201d When Rowley was discharged from hospital, health chiefs made it clear that Charlie Rowley had been decontaminated and posed no risk to the community."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
