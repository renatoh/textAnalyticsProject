It's a non-ministerial government department set up as an explicit response to the way in which mad cow disease had been handled. And let's not forget what a disaster that was, and the impact that it had on public confidence in the government's use of scientific evidence. Since then it has been a pioneer in transparency (most of the meetings of its committees are conducted in public), in rigorous commitment to the best evidence (rather than prejudice and anecdote), and in its efforts to consult widely and without bias in the development of advice to government. Now it is under attack over GM. Europe, comfortable in the assumption that it could be self-sufficient in food production and supply, is suspicious about GM foods. That attitude was forged in the fevered \"debate\" of 1998, fuelled by Dr Arpad Pusztai's assertions about the risks from GM potatoes, on the basis of then-unpublished observations on rats, and the Daily Mail's \"Frankenfoods\" campaign. As GM food production grew elsewhere in the world, the cabinet office published in 2008 a review of the whole issue of food security called Food Matters. Defra and the FSA were asked to review global trends in GM production and \"the extent to which changes in the market are putting a strain on the regulatory system for GM products\". The recently published email exchange between the agency and the Biotechnology Council appears to have been part of a broad consultation among stakeholders about the draft Defra/FSA report.It would not be in the public interest if industry were excluded from discussions about the future of food production. They are ultimately responsible for it, after all. The difficult task for the FSA is to deal with industry in a way that should not lead to accusations of bias or complicity. Three years ago the FSA set up a general advisory committee on science, with the specific remit to \"challenge\" the agency on its use of scientific evidence. The agency invited me to chair that new committee, and I was happy to accept, because I saw it as the latest indication of the FSA's commitment to openness. What I write here is entirely my own opinion, not that of the committee I chair. But my committee, which sets its own agenda, will surely want to look at the accusations made against the FSA, I trust that the government and the public will see that open and rigorous process as preferable to Trial by Tabloid. Europe's belief it can survive without GM contrasts with the dire warnings from leading scientists about the gathering Perfect Storm \u2013 the combination of climate change, population growth, water shortage and inadequacies of food supply. We desperately need a solution to the problem of food security. GM might not be the answer but it is an option, with a clear scientific rationale, which we ought to consider. It would be irresponsible to reject scientific assessment of the risks and potential benefits of GM and to accept without challenge the unsubstantiated horror stories about GM and uncritical praise for organic farming from the ideological opponents of GM.
