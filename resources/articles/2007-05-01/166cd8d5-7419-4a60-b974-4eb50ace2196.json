ASM Clermont Auvergne is the newish name on an old bottle more familiarly known to rugby fans as Montferrand. But, in winning their second European Challenge Cup, eight years after their first, they still offered their agonised fans a reminder of an unparalleled tradition of blowing finals. This has afflicted them acutely in French championship finals, where their record is played seven, won none. Most memorable of these flops was the first, in May 1936, which encapsulated the political tensions racking France immediately after the election of the left-wing Popular Front government. Montferrand, funded by the Michelin tyre dynasty, were beaten 6-3 by a Narbonne team who proclaimed leftish allegiances and whose winning try was scored by a future Socialist MP. No such ideological tensions were present at Twickenham Stoop on Saturday but there were clear echoes of more recent traumas. It is only three years since Clermont somehow contrived to lose a Challenge Cup final 27-26 to a manifestly less gifted Harlequins team. Here, at Harlequin's home, they threatened to do the same again. There was again little doubt which was the more accomplished team. Clermont enjoyed an edge in the forward battle, with the former All Black Sam Broomhall marauding to constant effect. Out wide they offered the constant threat of two giant wings - with Julien Malzieu scarcely less dangerous than his captain, Aur\u00e9lien Rougerie, an experienced international sure to go to the World Cup. That they contrived to reach the interval trailing 6-3 was down to spirited Bath defending, penalty misses by their Australian outside-half Brock James and a remarkable facility for butchering clear chances. A lateral pass, instead of the one from James that the video referee Gareth Simmonds ruled to be forward, would easily have sent the full-back Anthony Floch over in the 28th minute. Eleven minutes later Rougerie watched unmarked from the wing as his team-mates chose to cut back inside and were turned over on the Bath line. The scoreboard finally began to reflect reality in the third quarter as Clermont scored three tries in 18 minutes to lead 22-6. Malzieu scored the first with a solo run through three would-be tacklers, then staged another rampage to create the position from which James claimed the third, gathering his own chip ahead to score under the posts. In between the veteran Argentinian hooker Mario Ledesma surged down the left after a deftly-contrived line-out and the centre Tony Marsh crossed. That James's conversion fell back after striking both post and crossbar seemed academic. By the final few minutes it was anything but. Bath are, as Clermont coach Vern Cotter said afterwards, \"a confident team who believe in themselves and can threaten from just about anywhere\". Bath's Maori wing Joe Maddock's solo try, charging through after full-back Nick Abendanon and replacement wing Tom Cheeseman had made the incisions down the left, gave them the momentum they needed with 17 minutes to go. Olly Barkley converted to cut the gap to nine points. It took a crunching tackle by Marsh on Maddock to keep Bath at bay six minutes later, then only a video verdict denied them as replacement flanker Peter Short reached over the line in the 70th minute. Barkley's penalty brought Bath within range five minutes from time and that final period was played in agonising tension as Bath hammered at the Clermont line. In the final few seconds Bath captain Steve Borthwick won a lineout then orchestrated a rolling maul to within a few metres. An overlap loomed on the right but Danny Grewcock fumbled, poetic justice perhaps given the England lock's unpunished punch earlier in the game. Bath's season is over while Clermont can look forward to pursuing that elusive French title in next month's final-four play-offs. Cotter suggested this might have been perfect preparation: \"There was a lot of intensity that lasted the whole 80 minutes - and you don't always get that from league matches.\" Bath Abendanon; Maddock, Fuimanao (Cheeseman, 43), Barkley, Bory; Berne (Malone, 60), Walshe (Williams, 60); Barnes, Mears (Dixon, 72), Stevens, Borthwick (captain), Grewcock, Beattie (Short, 62), Feaunati (Scaysbrook, 60), Lipman.
