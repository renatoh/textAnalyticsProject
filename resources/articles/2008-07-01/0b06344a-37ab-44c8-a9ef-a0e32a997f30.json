For a show called Give Me Shelter, opening in the grounds of National Trust house Attingham Park in September, the artists will be installing sculptures on the theme of protection from disasters caused by global warming. Among the works on display will be The Large Huts by Christina Mackie - enormous, clod-like mounds inspired by concrete sun shelters in Pakistan - and Roma, a 20-metre steel walkway in the shape of a cattle run, designed by Keith Wilson. Anne de Charmant, curator and director of Meadow Arts, which commisioned the show, says: \"Each artist has responded to the size of the site with equally big ideas about some of the most important global issues we face today.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
