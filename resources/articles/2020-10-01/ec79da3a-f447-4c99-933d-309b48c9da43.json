Mourinho had on Wednesday urged Southgate not to play Kane in each of England\u2019s matches during the international break \u2013 against Wales, Belgium and Denmark \u2013 citing concerns over the striker\u2019s workload, although he said he would not call his counterpart to make the request. Southgate named a 30-man squad on Thursday, giving first call-ups to Bukayo Saka, Harvey Barnes and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, recalling Harry Maguire and omitting Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood in what he said was a message relating to discipline. Foden and Greenwood were sent home from the September internationals after inviting two women to the team hotel in Iceland, breaking Covid-19 protocols and squad rules. Southgate also sought to send a message to Mourinho, albeit one packaged in a playful way, as he marked his turf on the club-v-country debate that stands to be a theme of the season. \u201cJos\u00e9 was great, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d Southgate said. \u201cHe was on good form. I heard him. He won\u2019t phone but he\u2019s going to stand at the top of Tottenham\u2019s stadium and tell us, so that was good. We are certainly not looking to start players in three games. We\u2019ve got to be responsible. \u201cThe season as a whole is a huge challenge for clubs and national teams so we\u2019ve all got to work together. And all Jos\u00e9 needs to do is make sure that in April and May \u2026 he\u2019s got to look after Harry Kane for us because there will be 55 million people relying on that so that obviously works both ways.\u201d Mourinho had referenced his friendship with Southgate\u2019s assistant, Steve Holland, with whom he worked at Chelsea, leading Southgate to joke that he was disappointed not to be one of the Portuguese\u2019s friends. Typically, Mourinho had a comeback. It involved the Wales friendly and contained a slip of the tongue when he appeared to refer to Southgate as \u201cGary.\u201d Speaking after Spurs\u2019s 7-2 Europa League play-off win over Maccabi Haifa, Mourinho said: \u201cWhat I can promise to my friend Steve Holland and for Gary not to be jealous, for my friend Gary, I can promise that until the end of the season I don\u2019t play Harry Kane one minute of any friendly match.\u201d Southgate said he had told Foden and Greenwood before they were sent home from Iceland that he would not select them for the October get-together. He has not spoken to either since. They will not be picked for the under-21s during this window and their inclusion for the November break will depend on their club form. \u201cThey know what they did wasn\u2019t acceptable,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe needed that message to go out to all players who are involved with England at every age group. In the last few years we\u2019ve reconnected really well with the public and we\u2019ve got to make sure we protect that and there are standards of working as a team and your culture that are really important to protect.\u201d Southgate said he planned to remind his players after they report on Monday about what is required on England duty. \u201cYou always have to work at culture, it never is embedded for ever,\u201d the manager said. \u201cWe will discuss what it means to wear the shirt and some reminders on how we work but that\u2019s not a case of reading the riot act. That\u2019s a case of asking the players what sort of team they want to be involved in. \u201cWe addressed some of that last time round but when something like what has happened has happened we have to revisit that. In the end a lot of the discipline or culture comes from the decisions you make. Decisions send a message.\u201d Ben Chilwell, Jordan Henderson, Harry Winks and Marcus Rashford are back after withdrawing injured from the last squad but there are no places for the fit-again Luke Shaw, James Maddison or Ross Barkley. Southgate said in the case of Maddison and Barkley, who are feeling their way back to peak fitness, there were others in better physical shape in their positions. Southgate also revealed he was open to the return of Jamie Vardy, the Leicester striker who is in international retirement. The 33-year-old won the Premier League\u2019s Golden Boot last season and is joint-top of the scoring chart with Calvert-Lewin on five goals this time out. \u201cWe know Jamie is still around and we still communicate a lot,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cI\u2019m not in any way ruling him out if it\u2019s the right thing at the right time to bring him back into the fold.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
