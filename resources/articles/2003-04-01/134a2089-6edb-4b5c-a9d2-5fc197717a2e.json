Professor Hugh Stephenson, professor of journalism at City University, said the Mirror's sales decline indicated its \u00a320m revamp as a serious newspaper last year had not worked, and as a result editor Piers Morgan should \"move on\". \"The sad thing is I think it means that the agenda of trying to cover serious news in a tabloid newspaper is not commercially viable. News doesn't sell that sort of newspaper,\" Professor Stephenson said. \"Piers Morgan should move on. He's played his cards - it's not worked. There are two things that happen at newspapers when circulation is doing badly - you redesign them or you change the editor. I think in the case of the Mirror it's time for a change of editor,\" he added. Bill Hagerty, editor of the British Journalism Review and a former deputy editor of the Mirror, described the Mirror's plummeting circulation as \"depressing, in that overall, the modern Mirror is the best it's been in a long time\". \"But I think it does show - and Piers has already admitted elsewhere - that he overdid the anti-war stance once the war had begun, and I think it cost him,\" Hagerty added. \"I'm not suggesting he should have moved away from his position on the war, but the landscape was altered by the fact we had troops in Iraq. \"But one cannot but admire the stand that the Mirror took. Like it or not, they did it properly, they did it courageously, probably knowing that it might be unpopular, but perhaps not realising it would affect the circulation as badly as it has done.\" Investigative journalist Tom Bower, whose books have exposed the wrongdoings of former Mirror owner Robert Maxwell, said the Mirror was \"better off under Maxwell\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
