Populus polled 6,300 people for Which? and also found that, despite the economic recovery, two in five people were worried about household debt and half were worried about the level of their household savings and investments. The consumer group used the results to create a map which displays estimates of financial distress at regional, parliamentary constituency, and neighbourhood level. Hodge Hill in Birmingham was deemed to be the most financially distressed constituency, and other areas where one in six said they were reliant on payday loans or unauthorised overdrafts or defaulting on household bills included Bradford East, Islington North in London, and Belfast West. While it is no surprise to see areas in traditionally high deprivation regions such as the north-east, the West Midlands and Northern Ireland on the list, there are also pockets of distress in otherwise buoyant areas. For instance, Guildford, City of London and Westminster, and Bournemouth West were among the top 10 least financially distressed constituencies, but all contain at least one neighbourhood, sometimes consisting of just a few streets, among the 10% most financially distressed in the country. The head of economic analysis at Which?, Matt Oakley, said: \"We've found that throughout the financial crisis and coming out the other side of it, even though growth is returning people are still worried about their household situation. Even in areas many of us would see as doing quite well, being well off, there are neighbourhoods within these areas that are struggling quite a bit.\" The converse situation also exists whereby there are pockets of low distress among areas with high deprivation. For example, Ladywood, in Birmingham, and West Bromwich West are among the top 10 most financially distressed areas, according to the research, but both include neighbourhoods within the 15% least distressed. The polling was carried out between December 2013 and February 2014, the period during which unemployment fell and pay, including bonuses, outstripped inflation for the first time in four years, leading some to hail the end of the so-called \"cost of living crisis\". Oakley said: \"We all know the economy is improving, generally people are getting better off, but actually consumers are still struggling and we need to ensure we are focusing on helping consumers at a national level but also at a local level and tailoring policy responses to these local levels.\" The chief executive of Citizens Advice, Gillian Guy, said the Which? research chimed with the charity's experiences. \"While the economy is on the up, some household finances across the country are still floundering,\" she said. \"The legacy of the recession has led to many people cutting their spending down to the bare essentials and taking out short-term loans to pay the bills.\" After Hodge Hill, the most deprived areas, according to Which?, were Walton in Liverpool, followed by Warley in the West Midlands, Nottingham North and Barking in east London. The five least financially distressed constituencies were Bournemouth East, followed by Horsham, Worthing West, Mid Dorset and North Poole, and Poole."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
