From next week, David Norgrove will officially take the reins of the new pensions regulator and step into the centre one of the most heated political debates. Unions will want him to protect workers, while business leaders will want him to keep red tape, and the mounting costs of regulation, to a minimum. His appointment follows a series of company collapses that have left 65,000 workers in limbo, wondering if they will receive a retirement income. Firms ranging from the steel maker ASW to the components maker Turner &amp; Newell have collapsed with large holes in their occupational pension schemes. Workers who have saved for 40 years were told to expect as little as 10% of their pension when they reached 65 after all funds in the scheme were destined to protect existing pensioners. Last year the government reacted to the plight of the estimated 65,000 workers left with much reduced pension. It launched a \u00a320m-a-year government-funded lifeboat and said any further collapses would be covered by a Pension Protection Fund. It is Mr Norgrove's job to make sure as few as possible company schemes call on the resources of the protection fund. Already the fund is under attack for placing a tax on well run schemes that must pay a levy to show their support. This week a firm of actuaries said the costs to Britain's biggest, and mostly better- run pension funds would need to rise if the level of protection ministers expect is to be maintained. Mr Norgrove says his main job will be to make an assessment of all companies' schemes and then keep an eye on them using a \"risk-based approach\". That means he will focus his attention on those he believes might get into trouble. It will be his job to push them to top-up their fund and keep funding deficits to a minimum. He says he wants to discover the true scale of underfunding in company schemes \"because nobody really knows\". Current estimates put the total assets of Britain's 100,000 pension schemes at \u00a3750bn. Unfortunately, the scheme liabilities are estimated to run in excess of \u00a3900bn. He says: \"Company executives need to know that a pension fund deficit is an unsecured loan to the company and we want to know it is being given its proper weight in the scheme of things.\" He will have the power to require that companies make extra contributions. There are powers that allow him to impose sanctions on pension fund trustees. And there are legal requirements forcing actuaries and trustees to blow the whistle on funds breaching the rules. Most controversially, Mr Norgrove will have the power to intervene in mergers and takeovers to make sure the respective pension funds are secure. \"I won't be preventing mergers from taking place. But you might see the cost of a purchase go up. It will cost more to buy a company with a pensions shortfall that needs to be topped up,\" he says. Mr Norgrove came to prominence last year as chairman of the Marks &amp; Spencer pension trustees. Not usually a high profile job, it became the subject of banner headlines after a \u00a39.1bn bid by retail tycoon Philip Green for the chain. It was Mr Norgrove's first taste of the limelight after years in the civil service, banking and latterly as a strategist deep at M&amp;S HQ. If he takes on more battles he can expect employers to get angry. He says he doesn't care. He will do what he can to keep funds viable. Lets hope his enthusiasm doesn't persuade more firms to junk their funds altogether rather than risk a fight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
