His father had been a minister in the first republic (declared three years after Nigeria won independence from Britain in 1960), and his elder brother Shehu, a senior army officer, had been number two in the 1976-79 military regime of President Olusegun Obasanjo. The death of his brother in detention in 1997 at the hands of the dictator General Sani Abacha helped confirm Umaru in his already budding political career, elevating him first to the governorship of Katsina in 1999, and then, although he never expected to rise so high, to the presidency eight years later. Because of ill health, he was never able to maximise the possibilities of becoming executive head of state, but his goodwill, humility and personal integrity were always evident, and much appreciated in Nigeria, where he was often accorded one of the highest terms of praise \u2013 a \"gentleman\". However, the end of uncertainty over his condition means that Nigeria should now have a breathing-space of stability before entering into the tense contest of presidential and parliamentary elections next year. Yar'Adua was born in Katsina at a time when his father was already politically active, having acquired the traditional royal title of Mutawalli (custodian of the treasury), which his son later acquired. He went to Government college, Keffi, and then to Barewa college, Kaduna, the most prestigious school in the north. From 1972 to 1975 he studied at Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, where he obtained a BSc in chemistry, which he converted to a master's in 1978. He pursued a career as a lecturer until 1983, when he took up farming full-time, working as general manager of a farm in Katsina state. In the mean-time, though, he had become drawn into politics, dabbling with the radical People's Redemption party (PRP) in Nigeria's second republic (1979-83). After 1989, Nigeria attempted another civilian rule programme, and Yar'Adua supported his senior brother's political ambitions, which were, however, foiled by President Ibrahim Babangida. After the six years of General Abacha's dictatorship, in which his brother was murdered, Yar'Adua contested and won the governorship of his home state of Katsina on the ticket of the ruling party, the People's Democratic party (PDP). He ran Katsina state for eight years, prudently and without upsets. Indeed, he was often commended for his lack of corruption, having declared his assets as soon as he took office, a rare occurence for office-holders. Like other far-north Muslim states, Katsina adopted sharia law in 2000, but mostly, as with WS Gilbert's House of Lords, the governor \"did nothing in particular and did it very well\". Thus there was some surprise when, at the PDP convention early in 2007, he was picked as the party's candidate in the April presidential elections. This was seen as the personal choice of the then-President Obasanjo, for diverse and probably devious reasons, although it was uncertain whether he knew that the candidate had kidney trouble. The election, which he won with 70% of a low vote, was highly controversial because of claims of widespread rigging. Thus, when Yar'Adua was sworn in on 29 May 2007, he had two allegations to disprove: that he was Obasanjo's puppet, and that he had only won on the back of a flawed vote. On both he acquitted himself moderately well, showing that he was his own man and that his policies of reform and anti-corruption and emphasis on the importance of law were his own, and, more importantly, were pursued by his followers. Thus Obasanjo's dashing anti-corruption chief Nuhu Ribadu was replaced in 2008 by Farida Waziri, Yar'Adua's less high-profile nominee, and the central bank governor Chukwuma Soludo, who had introduced a widely praised bank consolidation in 2005, was replaced last year with the equally reform-minded Lamido Sanusi. Yar'Adua also stressed that in election petitions, the law should take its course, so several governorship elections were legally overturned, although the supreme court upheld his own election. He also began a process of reforming the messy megalith of the state oil company, made promises on improving Nigeria's notoriously inadequate electricity supply, and after alternating between force and appeasement, achieved a provisionally successful amnesty with rebels in the Niger delta, which seems to have held even during the period of illness and political wrangling. The stresses of power, however, took their toll on his already frail health, and he was obliged to travel overseas for treatment, first to Germany in 2008, then to Saudi Arabia. In November last year he went to Jeddah again, this time with heart inflammation to deal with on top of a serious kidney complaint, and returned only in February. His family and his closest political supporters suppressed any news of his condition, producing him only for a feeble broadcast on the BBC Hausa service in January saying he would be returning \"soon\". With government grinding to a halt and tensions mounting, the parliament voted for the vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, to become acting president last February. Although some questioned the constitutionality of the move, it seemed a pragmatic bid for stability, welcomed both domestically and internationally. There had also been concern that Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, was not exercising as much influence in international circles as had been the case in the past. Although at the beginning of last year he took on the chairmanship of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), the increasing severity of his illness meant that he was unable to make a significant impact, although he expressed strong views on the undemocratic practices of the leadership in Nigeria's northern neighbour, the Niger Republic, which was suspended from Ecowas in October last year. Yar'Adua's wife Turai, whom he married in 1975, had become increasingly powerful as his illness worsened, to the point where she was suspected of exerting undue influence on political decisions. She was with him all the time in Saudi Arabia, and once back in Nigeria watched over him closely, maintaining a blanket ban on news of his health up to the time he died. They had seven children. He also took a second wife, Hauwa, in 1992, with whom he had two children, and from whom he was divorced in 1997. All survive him. \u2022 Umaru Musa Yar'Adua, politician, born 16 August 1951; died 5 May 2010"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
