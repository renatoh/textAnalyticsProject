Perhaps the most extravagant is Bradford Exchange\u2019s commemorative men\u2019s watch: \u201cSurrounded by a rich, gold-plated casing and complemented by a genuine leather strap, the champagne-toned dial of this unique heirloom \u2026 showcases a handsome tribute.\u201d The limited-edition precision chronograph, with quartz movement, dials with stop-start function and battle sites expertly etched on the back, sounds just the thing for the trenches, except that at \u00a3130 it would have taken the average Tommy on a shilling a day nearly twice as long as the war lasted just to afford it. We\u2019ll leave it to the all-action mechanism to calculate equivalent monetary values. \u2022 Slightly less exasperating, though still pretty patronising, the CofE\u2019s Dover diocese is suggesting that parishes should invite the elderly to tea and serve them shortbread with poppy seeds and poppy-seed brioches with raspberry jam. The seeds of course stand in for the poppies that blew between the crosses row on row in John McCrae\u2019s famous poem. If you are also short of commemorative poppy seeds for the garden, your local B&amp;Q is selling seeds from Flanders \u201cas a visible and colourful reminder\u201d of the sacrifices the men then made. Half the proceeds go to the Royal British Legion, which is also supported in its admirable work by those well-known peacemakers at BAE Systems. \u2022 Things that could have been better expressed: a Metropolitan police survey of residents in Brent asking what they think of the service, entitled \u201cListening to one million Londoners\u201d. I suppose that only leaves 12 million they\u2019re not listening to. \u2022 An ominous straw in the wind for David Cameron in the shape of a weekend tweet by Rupert Murdoch: \u201cAsked is my daughter friend of David Cameron. Don\u2019t know but hope not.\u201d The old boy\u2019s holidaying in Maine and clearly has time on his hands to make mischief. Of course he has absolutely no influence over his newspapers\u2019 editorial allegiances. None whatsoever. \u2022 Those pictures of Prince George, our third in line to the throne, toddling about on his first birthday last week went down well on the other side of the Channel \u2013 his clothes were from the French children\u2019s clothing firm Petit Bateau. They were understandably thrilled, especially when the pictures went viral and the clothes immediately sold out. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t imagine a better ambassador than this lively little boy,\u201d oozed the firm\u2019s managing director, momentarily misplacing his Gallic republicanism. Hmmm: shouldn\u2019t our royals be flying the flag for British manufacturers on such an occasion? Are there no romper suits in John Lewis? The French take these things seriously: when President Hollande showed off his new spectacles recently he was immediately taken to task for choosing Danish frames instead of local ones. He tried really hard to make amends by ordering some proper French sunglasses \u2013 only to be told he couldn\u2019t have them before September. H\u00e9las, the workers need August off too. \u2022 Still, it must be some comfort to the hard-pressed French taxpayer that the departure of Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, the president\u2019s squeeze, and her entourage from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace has saved \u20ac500,000 a year, according to the annual governmental audit uncovered by Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9. It\u2019s an ill wind. \u2022 Rather a shame the enterprising idea by local Brownies in Leamington Spa to lend homeless folk tents to sleep in has been met with quite such a douche of cold water by the local council. They don\u2019t want riff-raff sleeping in their nice clean parks this summer and have started confiscating the tents. Health and safety considerations and planning contraventions, of course, a spokesperson for Warwick district council helpfully explained to the Leamington Observer: \u201cWe\u2019d much prefer any organisation distributing tents refer the person to us so we can make proper, lasting arrangements which might include signposting them to other support networks or assisting them into better temporary accommodation.\u201d Pity the council didn\u2019t save the guides the trouble earlier."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
