For most of the last 30 years, since the fall of the Soviet Union, democracy promotion has been a mainstay of American foreign policy. Republicans and Democrats, in Congress and the White House, have embraced the notion that democracies make good allies \u2013 and that the US plays a central role in spreading democratic government around the world. Not any more. After four years of Donald Trump\u2019s chaotic presidency, that consensus has been stretched to breaking point. Trump himself repeatedly questioned the legitimacy of America\u2019s own democratic process claiming \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that several million illegal votes were cast against him in 2016. He has frequently undermined public confidence in mail-in ballots and cast doubt on whether he will even accept the results of next week\u2019s elections. On Monday he once again tweeted as part of his long-running campaign of disinformation to curtail vote-counting: \u201cBig problems and discrepancies with Mail In Ballots all over the USA. Must have final total on November 3rd.\u201d The tweet was so egregiously false \u2013 and potentially illegal \u2013 that Twitter hid the president\u2019s statement behind a public warning that it might be misleading about how to vote, along with a link to its own civic integrity policy. For the institutions that promote American democracy around the world, this is a deeply challenging time: when American elections are being questioned by an American president, whose own politics and preferences align him more closely with authoritarian leaders than democratic allies around the world. Much of the work of democracy promotion is handled by two groups aligned with American political parties: the International Republican Institute (IRI) and the National Democratic Institute (NDI). For 25 years, the IRI board was led by the late senator John McCain, while the NDI board is chaired by Madeleine Albright, who served as Bill Clinton\u2019s secretary of state. Drawing on taxpayer funding, and with explicit mandates to steer clear of domestic politics, both organizations walk warily around the minefield of the state of American democracy. The IRI\u2019s board features Trump loyalists including senators Lindsey Graham, Tom Cotton and Joni Ernst. \u201cFreedom fighters in places like Hong Kong and Belarus are not waiting on us to perfect our democracy \u2013 they want our help now,\u201d said Dan Twining, IRI president. \u201cWe have been working on our democracy for nearly 250 years, and while there is always more work to be done, the struggles we have overcome here are relevant to best practices we can share with partners at different stages of democratic development.\u201d His counterpart at the NDI acknowledged the current election\u2019s challenges but insisted they were not affecting its work overseas. \u201cSo far NDI has not found that what is happening in the United States is affecting our ability to do democracy support work around the world,\u201d said Derek Mitchell, NDI president. \u201cThere is no doubt the US example matters, as many countries look to the United States as a touchstone of democratic practice. But wherever it exists, democracy is imperfect and forever a work-in-progress. US democracy is no different, and NDI has never asserted otherwise. We believe other nations can learn lessons from the challenges currently facing US democracy, just as they may learn from its strengths.\u201d However, the challenges facing US democracy promotion have clearly grown through the Trump years. The Trump administration proposed gutting the $2.3bn budget for overall democracy promotion by 40% in 2019, covering activities ranging from election support to judicial reform and human rights. The cuts including a 60% reduction for the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) that funds democracy promotion. Freedom House, an independent and non-partisan non-profit group promoting democracy since 1941, said Trump\u2019s proposed cuts would reduce US security. When Trump suggested last month that he would not accept the results of next week\u2019s election, Freedom House \u2013 which normally assesses the state of democracy and freedom around the world \u2013 condemned the president\u2019s statement as \u201can unacceptable threat to the continuity of American democracy\u201d. At the same time, authoritarian leaders around the world have made no secret of their opposition to US support for democracy promotion. The NED has come under repeated fire from the Russian and Chinese governments. Russian state media accused it of organizing the 2015 uprising in Ukraine that ousted its pro-Moscow leader, and banned them from operating inside Russia. Beijing has claimed the NED worked alongside the CIA to promote the Hong Kong protests last year. To be sure, the 2020 election is not the first challenge to American credibility in democracy promotion. While conservatives drew a straight line from the cold war to the war on terror, the reality of the US record since the second world war has been contradictory in both supporting and overthrowing democratically elected governments. Ending tyranny was not the goal: opposing Communism was. Still, Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 and his frequent attacks on the election process \u2013 pose unique threats to democracy promotion, according to Max Bergmann, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. \u201cWe have lost a ton of credibility and it\u2019s in part because we have a president that isn\u2019t walking the talk of democracy promotion. If we were analyzing ourselves as if we were a foreign country, we would say it\u2019s incredibly problematic that he describes his opponents as criminals. It\u2019s his behavior in places where democratic allies have been treated as though they are adversaries, and autocrats are treated as though they are close allies,\u201d Bergmann said. Joe Biden has proposed hosting a Summit for Democracy in his first year in office, gathering together \u201cthe nations of the Free World\u201d with the aim of \u201cdefending against authoritarianism, including election security.\u201d The summit would include civil society groups that have been targeted by authoritarian regimes, as well as businesses including technology and social media companies. However, conservative analysts say Democratic concerns about next week\u2019s election are overblown \u2013 despite the president\u2019s comments \u2013 and will not harm democracy promotion overseas. \u201cI don\u2019t really think we are struggling. I think that is an awful lot of frothing at the mouth that relates much more to politics than fact,\u201d said Danielle Pletka, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cThere are certainly instances which you can cite that are discouraging in defending democracy, but those who suggest that somehow this moment is over for the US to promote democracy, or stand for democracy, seems to me to be overstated. \u201cThere are lots of things that Donald Trump says that he shouldn\u2019t say. But if you go back pretty much regularly \u2013 if not every two years, every four years \u2013 there\u2019s some sort of hysteria about polling places and voter suppression.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
