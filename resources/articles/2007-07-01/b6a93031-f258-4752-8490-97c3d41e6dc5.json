For he was never without a cigarette, even after he had been diagnosed with emphysema and cancer in both lungs. He was far too ill to go to any of his beloved restaurants, bars and nightclubs at which smoking is now forbidden; and no hospital could stop him smoking either, for he spent his final days at home. So it is comforting to know that one of the last great celebrity smokers was able to die in the saddle. My sister, with whom Melly used to stay from time to time in Dumfriesshire, recalls that on his last visit he spent most of his time in bed, surrounded by overflowing ashtrays. She assures me that he never weakened in his resolve to go on smoking to the end. This was impressive, considering that he himself was proof of how disastrous smoking can be for the health. But he was a member of that diminishing band of admirable people who do not think that good health and longevity are the only purposes of existence. That's why the late Auberon Waugh used to say that all the nicest people were smokers. Melly believed that what he did with his life was much more important than how long it was. He believed in enjoying himself and doing what he wanted, whatever the consequences. This being so, he lived surprisingly long. If it hadn't been for a couple of Americans who stayed with me in Northamptonshire last weekend, I would never have known what was going on at nearby Althorp, the ancestral home of the Spencer family and burial place of Diana, Princess of Wales. My American friends came to stay because they had been invited to a gay wedding there. And what a wedding it turned out to be. It was the union of two Americans - a rich, Anglophile writer called Andrew Solomon and his friend John Habich; and some 300 of their American friends had flown over from the United States for the occasion. The celebrations were spread over three days, and cars with drivers were provided to ferry the guests back and forth from their hotels. Within the park of Althorp, the guests were driven about in horse-drawn carriages by people in 18th-century dress. Proceedings opened on Friday with a \"rehearsal dinner\" (a feature of all American weddings) in Althorp's great picture gallery, hung with Van Dycks and other 17th-century portraits; continued next day with the wedding ceremony, followed by dinner for 400 in an enormous tent with fireworks and dancing; and ended on Sunday with a special opening of the Diana Exhibition in the stable block and a mass picnic on a hill in the park. Then the happy couple departed in a British army tank that had been painted pink. The whole thing clearly cost a fortune, but Solomon and Habich told their guests in a message of welcome that they wanted \"to ensure that your weekend is a fiesta of relentless bliss\", and the cost didn't seem to matter. \"We know that many of you have come a terribly long way to be here - and that the world has come a terribly long way for this to be happening,\" they said. \"We're truly thrilled on both counts.\" The fact that all this was going on practically on my doorstep, and that I learned about it only by accident, made me wonder how unusual it was. For England is becoming a playground of the international rich. From Russian oligarchs to Hollywood stars, they all love it here. More than half of London houses over \u00a33m are sold to foreigners. We used to keep vaguely abreast of how our own aristocracy was living it up, but the new international elite moves in much more mysterious ways. The driver allocated to my houseguests was a nice young man who turned out to be a commando of the Royal Marines, doing a bit of moonlighting while on leave from service in Afghanistan. Over a cup of tea, he told me he was returning to that country shortly; and I expressed my concern that, with a wife and two small children, he should be taking such risks. He said I should not be concerned; that he was in the military because he wanted to be; that his job was to fight and that he did it because he enjoyed it. Other people did what they wanted to do - me journalism, for example - so why shouldn't he? It was not fighting that he found frustrating. He said he resented the media whingeing on behalf of people like him about poor equipment, inadequate medical care, and so on. He and his comrades were tough; they had no complaints. Perhaps we in the media have not been showing them the right sort of respect. If Boris Johnson decides to join the race to be mayor of London, I will support him. I have no idea what kind of administrator he would be, but I don't think that's the most important thing. What this strange hotchpotch of a city needs most is a mayor who will make its citizens proud. Despite his charm and charisma, Ken Livingstone doesn't quite pull it off. He doesn't manage to imbue Londoners with the kind of enthusiasm that New Yorkers feel about their city. Johnson, on the other hand, is so clever and so popular that he might be successful at defining and articulating what makes London remarkable. And his own energy as he jogs and bicycles round the capital would be another kind of inspiration. This week Alexander watched Fiona Bruce's The Real Cherie on BBC1: \"'I don't think we'll miss you,' Cherie Blair shouted at the press as she left Downing Street for the last time. And after this programme, I don't feel I'll miss her, either. The 'real' Cherie, a warm-hearted down-to-earth Scouser, was much less interesting and hardly more appealing than the brilliant but wacky QC.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
