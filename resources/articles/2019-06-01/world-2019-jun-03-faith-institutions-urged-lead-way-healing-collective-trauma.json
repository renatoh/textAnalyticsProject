Amina Mohammed, the UN\u2019s deputy secretary general, who is a Muslim, and Amanda Khozi Mukwashi, the chief executive of Christian Aid, have called for faith-based organisations to take a lead in facing up to global challenges such as poverty, inequality, migration and the climate emergency. \u201cThe world has experienced a level of collective trauma, as a result of many different things \u2013 conflicts, extreme poverty and hunger, loss of home and shelter, climate impact. Even here in the UK we have a country that is divided on many fronts,\u201d Mukwashi said. There was \u201ca need for a collective healing\u201d, she said. \u201cAs faith institutions, we have to be really bold and brave, and we need to bring all the tools, the skills that we have to try to help the world to heal. We can come up with economic solutions but when people are so hurt and divided, they need something extraordinary that touches the humanity in us. Nobody can stand on the sidelines, it\u2019s a moral imperative.\u201d Faith institutions had been \u201cat the heart of horrific things in the past, but they have also been instrumental in the civil rights movement, the anti-apartheid movement, at the heart of providing education and healthcare services in developing countries\u201d. Mohammed, who was appointed second in command at the UN in 2016, said faith leaders had to \u201cget back to basics. Congregations will follow, but they\u2019ll only follow a narrative that calls for core values of tolerance, peace, respect, dignity to be adhered to. This is not going to be an easy journey because we have fallen behind considerably.\u201d But faith organisations had the potential to \u201cbreak across silos\u201d, she said, adding that countries were no longer just dealing with issues within their borders. She said leaders from different religions and different parts of the world needed to find common ground and work from there. Mohammed later told a meeting at Christian Aid\u2019s London headquarters: \u201cWith a rise in xenophobic rhetoric, antisemitism and anti-Muslim hatred, there is a growing global interest in engaging religious actors as peace mediators and as builders of inclusive and peaceful societies. \u201cTime and time again, faith-based organisations have stood in the face of rising tensions and conflict. They have provided space for open and constructive dialogue.\u201d Speaking to the Guardian, she acknowledged \u201clegitimate\u201d criticism of the UN as overly bureaucratic and top-heavy. \u201cA lot of the time, with good intention, we thought we knew best \u2013 we prescribed a lot and didn\u2019t listen enough. And we weren\u2019t able to bring the resources on the scale needed to deal with the issues.\u201d But she added: \u201cThere is a need for that space where all voices come together, 193 countries, to discuss challenges that can only be resolved in that kind of a space.\u201d Changes begun in the past two years needed to speed up, Mohammed said: \u201cThe challenges [we face] are not waiting for a reform that is going to take a decade.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
