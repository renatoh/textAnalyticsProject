A bucolic array of likembes (the chiming thumb pianos that helped to make Konono No 1's first volume in this series one of the landmark releases of the decade so far) are meshing gently together in a syncopated swirl when, suddenly, a giant belch of amplified distortion comes clumping into the picture. Just as the listener is deciding whether to howl in protest or punch the air with delight, a sinuous guitar line ushers in a richly layered call-and-response vocal. The elegance with which these apparently warring elements are resolved over the next six minutes is a moving testament to the human capacity for improvisation and co-operation that somehow persists amid the turbulent circumstances of the Congo. Bringing together 25 musicians (including no fewer than six lead vocalists) from six different bands to put a 21st-century twist on to the folk heritages of five separate - and sometimes mutually antagonistic - ethnic groups ought to have been a recipe for chaos. After all, the Gallagher brothers are always arguing, even though there are only two of them and they both grew up in the same house. But from the deceptively restful instrumental workout of 'Beyond the 7th Moon' to the euphoric finale of 'Drowning Goat (Mbuji-Mayi)', this amazing album unfolds with a sensuous logic that cannot be constrained."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
