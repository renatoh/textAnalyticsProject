Jimmy Kimmel: \u2018They\u2019re very effective against perjury\u2019 The host of Jimmy Kimmel Live started by covering Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union. Sondland\u2019s original testimony on allegations that Trump demanded a quid pro quo with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, represented a denial \u2013 but Sondland now claims his memory has changed. \u201cI wonder what jogged his memory?\u201d Kimmel asked. \u201cMaybe he started taking those omega-3 supplements. They say they\u2019re very effective against perjury.\u201d He then played footage of Trump showing off at a rally, recounting compliments from Lou Dobbs, who reportedly claimed he was the greatest president of all time. \u201cCan you imagine anyone else in the world talking like that?\u201d he asked. \u201cStroking themselves so vigorously in front of other people. It\u2019s crazy. We have a crazy person running our country.\u201d Trump also claimed he was getting no credit for the recent killing of the Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and instead the dog involved is getting more praise. \u201cIt took three years but our president is finally feuding with a dog,\u201d he said. Kimmel also joked about Donald Trump Jr\u2019s new book Triggered which is filled with anger toward Obama, liberals and the media. \u201cBasically, for $18 you get to read his father\u2019s Twitter account,\u201d he joked. In the book, Don Jr claims his father cannot be racist because as a kid he was allowed to hang out with Michael Jackson. \u201cNothing says I love my son more than leaving him in a room with Michael Jackson,\u201d Kimmel said. Stephen Colbert: \u2018I\u2019m beginning to think this Trump fella might get impeached\u2019 On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert started by saying: \u201cI\u2019m beginning to think this Donald Trump fella might get impeached.\u201d He then also brought up Sondland\u2019s latest testimony. \u201cThe evidence is pretty damning in that it\u2019s exactly what we already knew,\u201d Colbert said, before claiming this should be \u201cgame, set, match\u201d for the inquiry over Trump\u2019s behaviour. Colbert shared information that Jay Leno was reportedly at a dinner with Zelenskiy and Jared Kushner as the Ukrainian president is a big fan of his work. \u201cI\u2019m just being told that Jay Leno is the new president of Ukraine,\u201d he joked. \u201cSorry Conan, better luck next time!\u201d New reports have also suggested that Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, was worried about being fired by tweet by Trump. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than being fired by tweet. Except maybe getting divorced by Snapchat,\u201d he said. Trevor Noah: \u2018I thought you said squid pro quo\u2019 On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah also spoke about Sondland\u2019s updated testimony. \u201cWe can\u2019t even edit our tweets, but this guy\u2019s walking into Congress like, \u2018Oh, you guys said quid pro quo! I thought you said squid pro quo,\u2019\u201d he joked. Noah continued: \u201cI feel bad for Sondland, because he was the first to testify and he probably thought everyone was gonna have his back and say there was no quid pro quo. But then instead everyone snitched on him.\u201d Seth Meyers: \u2018A 40-year-old waiting to be picked up from soccer\u2019 On Late Night, Seth Meyers also covered Sondland. \u201cIf that\u2019s something you just remembered then think of all the small stuff you\u2019re forgetting,\u201d he said. \u201cSomewhere there\u2019s a 40-year-old man still waiting to be picked up from soccer.\u201d He moved on to Trump\u2019s rally which saw him stand in front of supporters wearing \u2018Read the testimony\u2019 T-shirts. \u201cI get the feeling they didn\u2019t bring them from home,\u201d he said. Meyers also joked about Donald Trump Jr\u2019s new book Triggered which he said was almost called Dad, Do You Love Me Yet? before also mentioning his Michael Jackson anecdote. \u201c\u2018That guy always creeped me out,\u2019 said Michael Jackson,\u201d he quipped."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
