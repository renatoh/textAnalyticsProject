The raid on the public broadcaster\u2019s headquarters comes just one day after the AFP raided the home of a News Corp political editor over articles she published in 2018 on proposals to expand Australia\u2019s domestic surveillance capabilities. The searches have sparked concern about press freedom in Australia, with the media union denouncing them as a disturbing attempt to \u201cintimidate\u201d journalism. The ABC warrant names the reporters Dan Oakes and Sam Clark, as well as the ABC news boss, Gaven Morris. In a statement less than an hour after the AFP officers entered the office, the ABC managing director, David Anderson, called the raid \u201chighly unusual\u201d. \u201cThis is a serious development and raises legitimate concerns over freedom of the press and proper public scrutiny of national security and defence matters,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ABC stands by its journalists, will protect its sources and continue to report without fear or favour on national security and intelligence issues when there is a clear public interest.\u201d The AFP said it was investigating \u201callegations of publishing classified material, contrary to provisions of the Crimes Act\u201d after the stories were referred for investigation by the defence force chief the day after the ABC published them in July 2017. \u201cNo arrests are planned today as a result of this activity,\u201d the agency said. \u201cThis activity is not linked to a search warrant executed in Canberra yesterday.\u201d AFP officers entered the Harris Street premises just after 11.30am. It is understood the broadcaster had some notice of the raid. The executive editor of the broadcaster\u2019s news section and head of its investigative journalism unit, John Lyons, has been live tweeting the raid since it began. Lyons\u2019 reported on Twitter that AFP officers downloaded more than 9,000 items from ABC computers during the raid, and were then going through them one by one. In a radio interview on Wednesday afternoon, Lyons said he expected the raid to go on for hours if not days. \u201cWhat they are trying to do I think, is essentially send a message to people like us, people doing the job of journalists, that from now on you\u2019re on notice and anyone you talk to, anyone you have text contact with, any digital footprint at all \u2013 we will know about it,\u201d Lyons told 2GB Radio. \u201cIt really feels like a violation of what we do.\u201d Lyons said raids could have a chilling effect on journalists as well as the average person who sees wrongdoing and contemplates becoming a potential whistleblower. \u201cThe message to them is approach a journalist at your own peril,\u201d he said. In March 2019, David McBride, a former defence lawyer, was charged on five counts of leaking classified materials for blowing the whistle on the alleged misconduct by Australian special forces in relation to the The Afghan Filesspecial investigation. He has been committed to the supreme court for trial. The ABC raid comes less than 24 hours after AFP officers served Smethurst a warrant to search her Canberra home, phone and computer 14 months after she published a story about a top-secret proposal to expand the nation\u2019s domestic surveillance agency\u2019s capabilities. The AFP spent almost eight hours at Smethurst\u2019s home in a raid condemned by her employer, the media union, the national press gallery, some politicians and digital rights and human rights groups. On Tuesday afternoon the Sydney radio 2GB host and Sky News presenter Ben Fordham said he had been contacted by home affairs officials after he reported that asylum seeker boats were headed to Australia. Fordham said the officials had told him he was not the target of the home affairs investigation but the department was seeking to establish who had leaked him the information. During a press conference in London, prime minister Scott Morrison attempted to distance himself from the Smethurst raid, saying it was a matter for the AFP and he was \u201cuntroubled\u201d by the upholding of Australian laws, but believed in press freedom. The attorney general, Christian Porter, told ABC radio on Wednesday morning he had not been briefed over the Smethurst raid but did not believe she or her employer were the ultimate target, which appeared to contradict an AFP statement that the warrant related to the \u201calleged publishing of information classified as an official secret\u201d. \u201cSo the investigation, if I can summarise in broad terms, is not about the journalist per se, it\u2019s about someone who may or may not have made an unauthorised disclosure against the terms of a very well-known provision of the Crimes Act to a third party,\u201d Porter told Radio National. On Tuesday, the AFP said the warrant did relate to the publication of the information. The AFP has not clarified what law its investigations relate to in either case. Section 79 of the Crimes Act includes the offence of \u201ccommunicating or allowing someone to have access to prescribed information without authorisation with the intention of prejudicing national security\u201d. Labor\u2019s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, said the opposition had requested a briefing from home affairs \u201cto seek to understand why raids of such nature are warranted\u201d, describing it \u201ca very significant action\u201d. \u201cMinister Dutton must explain what he knew about these two raids \u2013 one on a journalist\u2019s home and one on the ABC,\u201d she said. In a media conference held before the news of the ABC warrant broke, the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, condemned the Smethurst raid as \u201coutrageous\u201d. \u201cPeople do have a right to know if the government has proposals to interfere with their privacy in a way which I believe, is something that Australians should have some say over or at least knowledge of,\u201d he said. The legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre, Emily Howie, said the government\u2019s new espionage laws, passed with the help of Labor last year, raised concerns about the future of public interest journalism. \u201cThe new espionage offence is just the latest law to cover government in a shroud of secrecy and prevent insiders from speaking out. It\u2019s a dangerous law that goes too far and damages press freedom and should urgently be reformed,\u201d she said. The media union, the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, said the ABC raid represented \u201ca disturbing attempt to intimidate legitimate news journalism that was in the public interest\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
