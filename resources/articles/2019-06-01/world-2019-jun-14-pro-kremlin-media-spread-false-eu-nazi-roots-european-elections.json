Malicious actors sought to promote extreme views and polarise local debates, said Julian King, the British commissioner in Brussels. Although there were no \u201cspectaculars\u201d such as the major email hacks that tarnished the 2016 US presidential election, social media accounts promoting a pro-Russian narrative were active in amplifying divisive content on the internet, King said. Countries targeted by bots and fake accounts in the run-up to the elections at the end of May included the UK, Poland, Latvia, Spain and France. King said: \u201cThere was an issue in Poland where false reports by [the Russian state news agency] Sputnik, which \u2013 let\u2019s be polite, let\u2019s call it as pro-Kremlin outfit \u2013 was reporting that the EU had made Poland poorer than it was under communism. \u201cAnother story they were running was that President [Emmanuel] Macron wants to expel some current member states from the EU, therefore making any suggestion that others might join redundant. \u201cThere was use of a fake account twitter account that is linked to Russia, and at the same time a pro-Russian Facebook group, to push an old report, a 2016 report, by the Katehon thinktank, claiming that the EU has Nazi roots. And that was accelerated and spread widely in the run-up to the elections.\u201d The Katehon thinktank, a Christian rightwing outfit, claimed three years ago that the Nazi vision of a \u201cunited Europe\u201d had formed the basis for the foundation of the EU. A report published by the commission found \u201ca continued and sustained disinformation activity by Russian sources aiming to suppress turnout and influence voter preferences\u201d during the election. \u201cThese covered a broad range of topics, ranging from challenging the union\u2019s democratic legitimacy to exploiting divisive public debates on issues such as of migration and sovereignty,\u201d the report added. King said there was an increasing trend for social media accounts with a pro-Russian government line to use a \u201ccustomised and carefully targeted approach \u2026 to amplify divisive content that is already out there to try and have an effect locally\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t think we should accept that as the new normal,\u201d he said. The EU\u2019s East Stratcom Task Force, which monitors disinformation, had identified 1,000 cases linked to Russian sources since January, equating to a more than twofold increase on the same period in 2018. King said: \u201cIt is not necessarily about breaking the law, but it is about attempting to mislead, and that is what we want to try and push back.\u201d Asked whether a link to the Russian government could be proven, King said the commission was careful not to overclaim in its analysis. He said: \u201cWe are clear that we are talking about \u2013 particularly East StratCom when they produce their reports \u2013 pro-Kremlin narratives. \u201cWe are not an intelligence agency, so we are not seeking to make assertions that go beyond what we can see to other links.\u201d A surge by populist parties, feared by many in Brussels, failed to materialise during the European elections, although both Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally in France and Matteo Salvini\u2019s far-right League party in Italy made gains."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
