I do not know where to start. Let\u2019s get the synopsis out of the way: Loqueesha (Amazon Prime Video, for some reason, streaming now) sees Jeremy Saville as Joe, a down-on-his-luck bartender who is really good at advice but can\u2019t get his dream job as a late-night call-in agony aunt because \u2013 and this is what the movie is saying, not me \u2013 because he is white. Actual line, said aloud, to nobody: \u201cAh, they want black women and minorities. They don\u2019t want a white guy like me!\u201d The ensuing plot device is one of the more offensive in history: Joe re-records his audition tape as Loqueesha, a monstrous pantomime of a black woman\u2019s voice, submits anonymously, finds great success and huge fame. A real film would end with \u2013 oh, I don\u2019t know, this completely crashing down? Him in jail? \u2013 but I think this is a film made to fulfil a bet made at a Klan members\u2019 barbecue, so instead he thrives and succeeds. Too much to even mention, but some notes: the literal opening line of this film is a guy in a bar saying: \u201c\u2026 and I have to put on this monkey suit \u2026 every single day!\u201d Every single supporting character who endorses Joe\u2019s scheme has deliberately been cast as a PoC, including his love interest who, in the film\u2019s penultimate scene, finally calls him out for being racist and sexist (the first time this concept has been introduced to the film audience!) then, bafflingly, kisses him. This film is so badly made \u2013 I don\u2019t think there was a lighting guy, because the actors variously flush purple, green and blue depending on the ambient light around them; the sound guy, if he exists, apparently recorded the audio on a piece of string tied to a tin can \u2013 it\u2019s so badly made that in three separate scenes (THREE SCENES!) Saville has visible food on his chin; there is a section where a newsreader\u2019s mouth briefly flips upside down because they clearly had to overdub it in post and the remaining VFX budget was, basically, \u201cAfter Effects 30-day trial\u201d. The Reason You Haven\u2019t Seen Any Of These Actors In Anything Ever Before Is Because They Belong In The Hague. A distraught bridge jumper is used as a plot point so clumsily that I think it technically breaks media law. Joe at no point learns a lesson in this movie and, in fact, there\u2019s a complicated setup where he teaches a black woman a morality tale about race, one of many moments where you pause and yell, to no one: \u201cWHO IS THIS FILM FOR?????\u201d Loqueesha\u2019s advice is supposed to be clever and funny and it is consistently neither. Joe is cast as \u201cthe smart guy\u201d in every scene so there\u2019s literally no journey because he\u2019s never wrong. And the ending sees the entire city learn that Loqueesha is actually a white man, and they choose to forgive him. I hold everyone who had a hand in this personally responsible. I hold whoever rented the 4K cameras to Jeremy Saville personally responsible. Camera-hire companies should have to see scripts before they give their equipment out! They should be up in court, too! The worst film ever made. The worst film ever made. Worse than The Room, in every way. The one-star rating it currently has on IMDb is actively generous. I cannot believe this film got made."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
