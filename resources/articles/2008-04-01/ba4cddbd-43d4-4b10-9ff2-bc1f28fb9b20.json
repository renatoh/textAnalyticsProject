Opposition to the 2006 secure fence act, which instructed the department of homeland security to build the fence by the end of 2008, has united an unlikely coalition of property owners and environmentalists. Property owners and developers have launched numerous lawsuits to deny the government access to their lands, arguing that their property rights would be violated or the values of their homes suffer. Environmentalists have challenged the government, saying that the plans would harm the natural habitats of species ranging from big cats to owls. Native American groups have also protested that their traditional lands and burial sites would be desecrated by the fence. The administration's action echoes a controversial provision of a 2005 act, which allowed the department of homeland security to waive all laws \"necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads\". That provision is the subject of a legal challenge by the environmental groups the Sierra Club and Defenders of Wildlife questioning the constitutionality of the law. They have petitioned the supreme court and expect to find out in the summer whether the case will be heard. Oliver Bernstein of the Sierra Club criticised the administration's most recent move. \"This is the latest effort from the Bush administration to waive environmental and other federal laws,\" he said yesterday. \"It threatens the livelihood and ecology of the entire US border region.\" The government's approach has also angered local politicians in Arizona and Texas, who have argued that the lack of consultation has worsened the problem. The department of homeland security, \"would get farther and do better if they would just let locals give input on many of these matters,\" Representative Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona told the Christian Science Monitor last month. \"A little bit less arrogance by the department of homeland security would go a long way.\" The secure fence act authorised the government to build 670 miles of double-layer reinforced wall along five sections of the 1,969-mile US-Mexico border. The longest section, comprising 370 miles, would cross several protected areas, including the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area, home to the San Pedro river. In Texas, the government has sued 50 landowners to gain temporary access to their properties to build the fence, while in Arizona a group of landowners is in dispute with the department over the amount of compensation offered while the fence is being built. One of the more absurd impacts of the proposed fence would have divided the campus at the University of Texas Brownsville. A lawsuit brought by the university against the government was settled out of court last month. The border fence project has run into innumerable problems. The much-vaunted \"virtual fence\" - a hi-tech network of radar and surveillance cameras meant as an alternative to the wire and concrete structures being built along the border that promises to alleviate many of the environmental concerns - was recently delayed amid technical problems and rising costs. Officials admitted in February that the first 100-mile stretch of the virtual fence would not be completed until the end of 2011, instead of its original deadline of the end of this year. Boeing, the contractor chosen to build the virtual fence, has been paid more than $85m (\u00a343m). The DHS initially estimated that it would spend a total of $7.6bn constructing the fence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
