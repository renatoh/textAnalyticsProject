On Sunday, organising chief Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki said that Athens is \"ready\" to host the Olympics. Just as well, considering that tonight features an opening extravaganza starring 8,000 volunteers. Sue Barker and Steve Rider present the BBC's coverage. Borat's Television Programme 9.30pm, Channel 4 Kazakh journalist Borat and bitchy Austrian fashion reporter Bruno get some time in the limelight without the overwhelming company of Ali G. Over two specials, Sacha Baron Cohen's creations explore the USA with satirical intent - Bruno getting wrestlers to appear on a gay TV show, Borat holding a silence for the victims of a non-existent massacre. The Osbournes 10.15pm, Channel 4 A Christina Aguilera-fixated episode as Kelly gets angry with Jack for dancing with the singer at a nightclub. With Kelly in the middle of a public spat with Aguilera, Jack can't resist the chance to wind up his sister. Elsewhere, a visit to the dentist brings nitrous oxide at a \"special Ozzy level\" and a decidedly befuddled Prince of Darkness; and Jack wants to go to Medieval World (jousting with added Hollywood pizzazz) for his birthday celebrations. BBC Four On BBC Two: The Robert Wyatt Story 11.35pm, BBC2 According to Robert Wyatt, the fall that left him in a wheelchair simplified his life choices, by forcing him to give up being the drummer in a band for a career as a writer and singer. In the 30 years since, Wyatt has created a series of beautifully idiosyncratic albums rooted in a love of jazz and pop, and become wedded to the belief that the world is full of kind people yet \"run by bastards\". Mark Kidel's film eavesdrops on Wyatt as he works on the Mercury-nominated Cuckooland and, best of all, sees the stage-shy ex-Soft Machine man performing live."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
