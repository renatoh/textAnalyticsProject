There's a vibrancy - a force - about the place that comes, I suspect, from the head-on collision between first and third world. Exclusive beachside suburbs that wouldn't be out of place in Sydney or southern California are just a short trip up the N2 motorway from townships such as Khayelitsha and Langa, acting as a reminder that there's more to the Mother City than Mercedes convertibles and cocktails. Tourism wise, Cape Town has an embarrassment of riches. Want to chill? Some of the most gorgeous beaches on the planet are a 10-minute drive from downtown. Although you might not be brave enough to swim (the best beaches are alongside the icy waters of the Atlantic), you can soak up some rays while spotting dolphins, and maybe even a whale or two. Shopping? Your credit card will be in for a pleasant surprise, even if the rand is now strengthening against the pound. Food - where to start? Just bring the elasticated trousers to enjoy the spoils of the Mediterranean-style climate. Feeling active? Climb Table Mountain, bike through vineyards, dive with sharks, 'sandboard' down dunes or surf some Atlantic rollers. Nightlife? The good news: Beer is around 60p a bottle and bars stay open very late. The bad news: Capetonians are way too gorgeous: six-packed, long of limb and high of cheekbone; and either dolled up to the nines, or more likely, sporting a dressed-down, boho chic look. Feelings of inadequacy from pasty Brits fresh off the overnight plane from the northern winter are likely. Getting there Virgin Atlantic (0870 380 2007) flies non-stop to Cape Town from Heathrow from \u00a3750. British Airways (0870 850 8950) and South African Airways (0870 747 1111) also fly the route non-stop. Fares are usually lower when booked through a travel agent such as Trailfinders (020 7938 3939) or Ebookers (0870 814 6025), and fall again if you are prepared to fly indirectly. Ebookers currently sells Qatar Airways from Gatwick via Doha and Johannesburg from \u00a3389 return for departures after mid-January. For tailormade city break packages to Cape Town contact Rainbow Tours (020-7226 1004; www.rainbowtours.co.uk) Five things you must do \u00b7 Visit Robben Island (00 27 21 409 5100) for \u00a314. The District Six Museum (00 27 21 461 8745) tells the history of the vibrant 'coloured' neighbourhood bulldozed by the Apartheid regime in the 1960s and is highly recommended. \u00b7 Take a township tour. Protestations that it's 'voyeuristic' are invalid as long as you visit with a company such as Cape Capers (00 27 21 448 3117), from \u00a326, led by amiable Faizal Gangat, where you know the money is going back to the local community. Better still, stay the night to really blow away any lingering stereotypes: Thandiwe Peter runs the very homely Ma Neo's B&amp;B in Langa (00 27 21 694 2504), doubles from \u00a331. \u00b7 Drive over Chapman's Peak. The spectacular road that hugs the cliffs south of Cape Town was closed for several years after a rockslide, but now - safety nets in place - it's open again and a scenic way to the surf beaches of Kommetjie, the old naval base at Simonstown, the penguins at Boulders Beach and the Cape of Good Hope . \u00b7 Watch the sun go down with a picnic on Camps Bay beach then retreat to one of the bars behind, such as Eclipse or Barazza. \u00b7 Gawp from behind your sunglasses at the models and beautiful people on Clifton fourth beach, or Clifton third if blokes in Speedos is your thing. What not to do \u00b7 Don't get hung up on crime. Be vigilant without being paranoid. The usual common sense rules apply. \u00b7 Don't spend all your time at the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront, Cape Town's Covent Garden. It's perfectly pleasant, but then so are garden centres. Better instead to slap on your shades and pose with a skinny cappuccino at Vida e Caff\u00e8 on Kloof Street (00 27 21 426 0627). \u00b7 Don't go in July and August. It's mid-winter and when storms blow from the Antarctic, they hit Cape Town first. \u00b7 Don't forget to dress up for high tea in the lounge at the colonial Mount Nelson Hotel (00 27 21 483 1000). Open to non-residents, \u00a310. Just because German tourists wear knee-length trousers and sleeveless T-shirts doesn't mean we have to. A room for the night All rates are per double and include breakfast. Budget: Zwinoni Lodge, Milnerton (00 27 21 551 9847), from \u00a347. This is one of the very few Cape Town B&amp;Bs that is owned by a black South African. Run by stylish Emmah Makatu, this five-bedroom B&amp;B in the suburb of Milnerton (a 20-minute drive from the centre - a hire car is recommended) is well decorated and a haven of tranquillity. Moderate: Cape Cadogan, Upper Union Street (00 27 21 480 8080), from \u00a385. A 12-bedroom townhouse in a good position for the bars, restaurants and shops of both Kloof and Long Streets with a laid-back feeling and great interior design. Luxury: Twelve Apostles Hotel, Victoria Road (0800 1698 8740, from \u00a3358). A 20-minute drive from central Cape Town and five from happening Camps Bay, this is accommodation for the Wallpaper* crowd. Try the Leopard room bar and lounge for evening cocktails overlooking the ocean or mid-afternoon 'tea by the sea'. Where to eat Cheap: Olympia Caf\u00e9 and Deli, Main Road, Kalk Bay (00 27 21 788 6396). A half-hour drive from downtown in the seaside village of Kalk Bay, this is fantastic for a lazy, drawn-out weekend brunch with mates and the papers. Grungy in an oh-so-fashionable way (with clients to match), service is good-natured but haphazard. Buttery scrambled eggs, sausages and toast with a large cappuccino will leave you with change from a fiver. The berries, yoghurt and muesli combo is divine. Moderate: Tank, de Waterkant Street (00 27 21 419 0007). Sit and pose at the main bar while playing with the water-filled menus and nibbling on sushi or take a table and go for more substantial fare. Low lighting and vibey tunes played at just the right level add to the atmosphere, as do the staff who are laid-back and friendly. Seared tuna with a white wine and wasabi sauce is \u00a38, chocolate pumpkin cheesecake for pud is \u00a33, while a glass of house white goes for \u00a32. Blowout: It's a relative term in Cape Town because unless you are Monsieur Creosote you're going to have to try almost impossibly hard to match UK levels of credit-card meltdown. Seemingly every review of Cape Town has to include Blues, Victoria Road, Camps Bay (00 27 21 438 2040), and there's a simple good reason: well-prepared food in a spectacular setting. You'll often need to book in advance, so when you do, ask for a table at the front, overlooking the beach. Start with West Coast oysters on ice with onion vinegar at around \u00a31.20 a pop, then try Cajun blackened salmon with caramelised pumpkin, mango-and-orange cream (\u00a38) or lamb cutlets with a date, mustard and almond jus (\u00a37), and end with a double chocolate tart with mint mascarpone (\u00a33). There's an extensive wine list. Big night out Start at the Mount Nelson Hotel (00 27 21 483 1000) on Orange Street. Yes, it's chintzy, but its recently revamped Planet champagne and cocktail bar is dressy and a shining oasis of cool. Then grab a taxi to Long Street. If you're feeling peckish, wolf a burger at Royale at number 273 (00 27 21 422 4536, closed Sundays) - a Miss Piggy with bacon, guacamole, relish and chips is \u00a33.50 - then head to Kennedy's at 251 (00 27 21 424 1212) for cigars and mojitos, before a very short walk across the road to Jo'burg at number 218 (00 27 21 422 0142), a bar that attracts a hip crowd. The other end of Long Street is rather grotty, but a shining beacon is the new and cool Metropole Hotel at number 38 (00 27 21 424 7247) where the first-floor M bar and lounge is definitely worth a stop, if only to ogle the bar tenders. Now hop in a taxi again to de Waterkant. If you're wanting a breather, grab a double espresso at Andiamo (00 27 21 421 3687), a lively cafe in the Cape Quarter Centre with lots of outdoor seating and always buzzing late on, before the short walk to the nightclub Opium (00 27 21 425 4010) on Dixon Street - breathe in, look gorgeous and you might just gain access to taste the signature chocolate chilli martini. For boys who like boys, Bronx (00 27 21 419 9216) is also close by on the corner of Somerset Road. Objects of desire If you love shopping malls, you'll be well served at the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront (00 27 21 408 7600) where there's everything from Diesel and Hugo Boss to a Cape Union Mart for outdoorsy camping and activity gear and a supermarket to stock up on South Africa's finest gift to the culinary world: Mrs Ball's Original Recipe Chutney. The many shops on Long Street are the place to go to for good quality 'junk', nick-nacks and general Africana for your shelves, while the De Waterkant district has a more designer-led flair (paintings, furniture, sculpture etc). If you really want a wooden giraffe (even if it is the equivalent of bringing back a straw donkey from Spain) then the outdoor market at Greenpoint every Sunday is your best bet. Half the stuff on offer is pure tat. The rest can be decent but be prepared to bargain. Better still, wait for the craft centres you'll be taken to on a township tour - at least you know your money's going straight to where it's needed most. Get around Cape Town has pockets of walkability - the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront, Observatory, Long Street, Kloof Street, Camps Bay, Seapoint etc - but to get from one to the other you need wheels and you don't want to be using shanks's pony at night. Buses aren't really tourist friendly and taxi fares are relatively expensive (around 80p per kilometre: sounds cheap but they soon click up). Hiring a car makes sense and gives you the freedom to explore outside the city too. Holiday Autos (0870 400 0010) has rentals from \u00a3133 per week. Driving is on the left. Petrol is around 50p a litre. Get out of town Stellenbosch is less than an hour's drive away in a spectacular setting surrounded by vineyards and mountains. It has a youthful buzz due to its large student population, but the real draw is the numerous wineries dotted round about, most with classic Dutch Cape architecture and offering wine tastings and lunches. Every local has their favourite - I had a great lunch with a backdrop of awesome scenery at Blaauwklippen (00 27 21 880 0133) so ask around or start planning with the help of www.wineroute.co.za.
