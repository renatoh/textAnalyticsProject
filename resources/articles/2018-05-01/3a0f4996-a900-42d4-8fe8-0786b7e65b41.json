Over and over again, company spokespeople have promised that they only start recording if someone says the wake word: \u201cAlexa\u201d. It\u2019s a spiel Danielle, an Alexa user from Portland, Oregon, had believed. She\u2019d installed Echo devices and smart bulbs in every room in her house, accepting Amazon\u2019s claims that they were not invading her privacy. But today she asked the company to investigate after an Alexa device recorded a private conversation between her and her husband and sent it to a random number in their address book without their permission. Danielle found out her Alexa was recording when she received an alarming call from one of her husband\u2019s colleagues saying: \u201cUnplug your Alexa devices right now, you\u2019re being hacked.\u201d She told KIRO-TV in Seattle that at first she didn\u2019t believe the co-worker, but then she said: \u201cYou sat there talking about hardwood floors.\u201d Danielle realised the colleague must have heard everything. \u201cI felt invaded,\u201d she told KIRO-TV. \u201cA total privacy invasion. Immediately, I said, \u2018I\u2019m never plugging that device in again because I can\u2019t trust it.\u2019\u201d An Amazon customer service representative confirmed that Danielle\u2019s audio had been sent to the number and apologised but didn\u2019t provide any information about why the device had been activated. A spokesperson for the company said it had \u201cdetermined this was an extremely rare occurrence\u201d. At 6pm ET on Thursday, an Amazon spokesperson provided an updated statement with an explanation for why they believe Alexa forwarded the conversation. They said: \u201cEcho woke up due to a word in background conversation sounding like \u2018Alexa\u2019. Then, the subsequent conversation was heard as a \u2018send message\u2019 request. At which point, Alexa said out loud \u2018To whom?\u2019 At which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customer\u2019s contact list. Alexa then asked out loud, \u2018[contact name], right?\u2019 Alexa then interpreted background conversation as \u2018right\u2019.\u201d Recognising the improbability of this series of mishaps occuring, they added: \u201cAs unlikely as this string of events is, we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely.\u201d Although Amazon maintains this was a malfunction rather than proof Alexa is always listening, the company has filed patent applications in the past for functionalities that involve always listening, such as an algorithm that would analyse when people say they \u201clove\u201d or \u201cbought\u201d something. The patent included a diagram where two people have a phone conversation and were served afterwards with separate targeted advertisements."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
