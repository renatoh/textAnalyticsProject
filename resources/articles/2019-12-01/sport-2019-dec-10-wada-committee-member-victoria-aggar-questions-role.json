Amid signs of a widening athlete backlash the retired Paralympian Victoria Aggar told the Guardian that allowing Russians still to compete at Euro 2020 \u2013 and under a neutral flag at the 2020 Olympics and 2022 World Cup despite a four-year ban imposed on Monday \u2013 made \u201ca mockery of the system and was embarrassing to Wada\u201d. \u201cThere comes a time when you think, \u2018Is it worth associating myself with such a spineless organisation?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think it is for everyone on the committee to have a think about where they stand. \u201cIt is not in our DNA to give up and I have stuck around to support our chair Beckie Scott,\u201d she added. \u201cBut it is just a constant battle. And when you are constantly not being listened to \u2013 and constantly berated \u2013 there comes a time when you think should I put my efforts elsewhere? Without making knee-jerk reactions I think a lot will happen in the next 48 hours.\u201d On Monday Wada\u2019s president, Sir Craig Reedie, announced Russia would be banned from global competitions for four years after manipulating and deleting doping data from its Moscow laboratory. However, Wada also agreed that individual Russian athletes would still be able to compete internationally if they could prove they were not tainted. Reedie also rejected calls for a blanket ban from Wada\u2019s athlete commission, calling them a \u201cginger group\u201d and saying full bans didn\u2019t work. However, Aggar said those comments were both \u201claughable and disrespectful\u201d. \u201cI thought about quitting when Wada made the Russian Anti-Doping Agency compliant again last year so I don\u2019t want to be the person that cries wolf and never acts on it after this appalling decision,\u201d she added. \u201cBut, while I\u2019ve hoped that things might head in the right direction, it\u2019s looking pretty bleak at the minute. \u201c I also know Wada would love me to leave because I am challenging them.\u201d Aggar has received the full support of Scott, who told the Guardian that the fight against doping was in a difficult place. \u201cIt just feels like an uphill battle,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a real disconnect between the athlete commission and leadership at Wada. \u201cThe commission is really dedicated and passionate about protecting clean athletes. However, at a time when Wada\u2019s Executive Committee finally had the power and authority to take legal action against such blatant corruption from Russia, it chose not to. It is surreal.\u201d Adam Pengilly, the second British member of Wada\u2019s athlete commission, also said he supported a full ban on Russian athletes because of the country\u2019s failure to tackle widespread state-sponsored doping. \u201cNothing has worked,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been reluctant to call for a full ban but until the system changes athletes will continue to get exploited in Russia. \u201cI have been told by a Russian friend in sport that it is a collective system and the majority of those who were around five to 10 years ago are still there. So the 12-year-old girl who wants to be a 1500m runner will probably be at major risk of having to be pushed into doping later in her career.\u201d Meanwhile, Rob Koehler, who heads the athlete-led movement Global Athlete, said a significant number of leading sportsmen and women had contacted him to express their frustration with Wada. \u201cIt is a step backwards compared to where we were in 2016, when Wada recommended a complete ban on Russia for the Olympics and Paralympics,\u201d added Koehler, who was previously the deputy general of Wada. \u201cReedie now says that blanket bans don\u2019t work \u2013 but the example of South Africa under apartheid suggests otherwise.\u201d Koehler also warned that the decision not to stand up to Russia would have worrying consequences. \u201cI think the credibility of Wada had already deteriorated but this decision has made it worse,\u201d he added. \u201cThe problem is that Russia is powerful. They host events and there is a lot of Russian representatives on various international sports boards, so their influence is wide and their tentacles are everywhere.\u201d The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said his country have \u201creason to appeal\u201d against the four-year ban imposed on Monday, claiming he did not agree with collective punishment. \u201cThe main thing, in my opinion, and it seems to me that everyone agrees with it, is that any punishment \u2013 since the times of Roman law \u2013 should be individual and based on what that individual did,\u201d he added. However, the head of the US Anti-Doping Agency, Travis Tygart, told the Guardian the court of arbitration for sport might also listen to an appeal from clean athletes who feel Wada\u2019s sanctions against Russia do not go far enough. \u201cCas rules allow for parties to intervene when it is appropriate and they are adversely affected,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether the athletes end up doing that will be their choice but, if Cas agrees with them, it would then have the ability to increase any punishment on Russia.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
