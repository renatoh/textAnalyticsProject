In fact, she had a smile to light up the darkest of days when she beat Norway's Suzann Pettersen in a play-off for the Irish Open to become the first Danish player to win an Evian Tour title. Tinning's cousin, Steen, won the men's Wales Open at Celtic Manor a couple of years ago, so she was maintaining a family tradition. \"I feel real pride,\" said the 28-year-old after tapping in for par at the first extra hole to beat Pettersen who, as she had done at the 18th, three-putted from long range. \"When Suzann missed that putt I just felt so thrilled.\" It was sweet revenge for a play-off defeat to Sophie Gustafson in the 1998 Irish Open at Ballyliffin, and her reward, apart from a \u00a315,500 cheque, was honorary life membership of the Killarney club. She says she will return, as long as the weather improves. Tinning, the joint overnight leader, closed with a 73, while Pettersen had a 72 to tie on two-under 214, while Maria Boden, an up-and-coming young Swede, had a hole in one at the 8th in a round of 70 to take third place, a shot behind. Lancashire's Kirsty Taylor, with a fine 71 in the horrible conditions, and Trish Johnson with a more lacklustre 75, were the leading Britons in a share of fourth place. Spain's Marina Arruti and Australia's Corinne Dibnah finished one-over on 217. For Pettersen, the top rookie last year, it was a second play-off defeat this year. She lost to world No2 Karrie Webb in the Australian Open in March, and is still seeking a second title to set alongside last year's French Open."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
