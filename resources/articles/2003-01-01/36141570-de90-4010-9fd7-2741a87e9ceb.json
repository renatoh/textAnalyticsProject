But under his editorship the paper was also fiercely critical of the government's tax rises, supposed softness on crime and support of further European integration. Here, in tribute to the departing Mr Yelland, are some of the Sun's finest political moments under his leadership. June 24 1998 The Sun, terrified about Tony Blair's apparent support for a European single currency, asked of the prime minister: \"Is this the most dangerous man in Britain?\" October 6 1998 On the first day the Conservatives' annual conference, the former newspaper of Thatcherism featured the Tory Leader, William Hague, as a dead parrot. It was right, eventually - he was gone in three years. September 30 1999 \"2 jags takes two cars 250 yards.\" The Sun reveals that John Prescott took his limousine 250 yards at Labour conference \"to lecture Britain on wasting fuel\". July 17 2000 The Sun splashes with \"Blair's panic memo\" - writing to his pollster, Philip Gould, the prime minister frets that he's \"out of touch\" over violent crime, court sentences, support for gay rights, Europe and the decision to scrap married couples' tax relief, and should be personally associated with some \"eye-catching\" initiatives. March 2 2001 \"It's in the bag, Tony\" declared the paper. \"It is now crystal clear, after Gordon Brown's Budget yesterday, that the election is in the bag.\" What's more, the Sun said that once again \"Blair gets our support for a second term.\" March 20 2001 The Sun gets the election date wrong - \"The general election WILL be held on May 3 despite opposition from some farmers,\" it revealed. It was in fact held on June 7, because of opposition from some farmers. June 7 2002 As in 1997, the paper that claimed it \"won it\" backs Labours, but warns \"don't let the people down, Tony\". December 18 2002 The dead parrot returns. \"This party isn't just dead...it is totally plucked.\" The Sun is not any kinder to Iain Duncan Smith than it was to his predecessor, giving him the parrot treatment too. Whether they are right this time remains to be seen..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
