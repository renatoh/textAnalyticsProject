On an ordinary weekend, the restaurant would be fully booked with diners travelling hundreds of miles, including from the UK, to sample Kinoshita\u2019s food. But this is no ordinary weekend. With the hotel closed because of the coronavirus crisis, Kinoshita is technically \u2013 if temporarily \u2013 out of work. So, instead of cooking for his usual guests, he is turning out dishes for the doctors, nurses and staff working round the clock at the nearest main hospital in the eastern French city of Dijon. On Sunday, the chef will set off in a borrowed refrigerated van to deliver 100 simple three-course meals to hospital staff. \u201cIn Japan, if there is a catastrophe the cultural response is to make something to eat, so I\u2019m very happy to be doing this. I was wondering what I could do to help at this time, and cooking for the health workers is a pleasure,\u201d Kinoshita, 40, told the Observer. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s my job. Where else would I be but in my kitchen?\u201d True, it is not the usual fare of oysters \u00e0 la japonaise or cerise de l\u2019Yonne and foie gras. For the hungry medics, Takashi \u2013 who is cooking while wearing a mask and gloves as well as his chef\u2019s whites \u2013 is creating a more hearty repast of quiche with vegetables and trout, mixed salad spring rolls in soft wraps and cream-filled choux pastries. \u201cWe are making what we can using what we have in stock and ingredients donated by local producers who didn\u2019t even think twice before showing their support and solidarity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s different from creating a gastronomic menu because the health workers need to eat something quick, substantial and balanced.\u201d France has confirmed more than 35,000 cases of Covid-19, with 2,314 deaths recorded as of Saturday night, up 319 in a day. Of those being treated in hospital, more than 3,700 were in intensive care. A government-ordered lockdown was extended last week for another fortnight, to 15 April \u2013 but the prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, has warned it could be prolonged again \u201cif the health situation requires\u201d. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vandendriessche, who runs the Ch\u00e2teau de Courban hotel, says news of the order for all restaurants, bars, caf\u00e9s and non-essential public places to close came halfway through dinner on 14 March. \u201cThe restaurant was full and we didn\u2019t know as we were working. Suddenly we had clients asking if they had to eat up and be out by midnight. It was a terrible shock, like something out of a film,\u201d he said. Vandendriessche\u2019s father, Pierre, an interior decorator, bought the 19th-century house as a family home in 1998. Twenty-two years on, it now has 24 rooms with showers and slipper baths, a spa and pool. Like many small and medium-sized businesses in France hit by the lockdown \u2013 about to enter its third week \u2013 Vandendriessche hopes the government will come good on its \u201csolidarity fund\u201d to guarantee loans and its promise that none will go out of business. The hotel\u2019s 30 low-season staff are on \u201cpartial unemployment\u201d with 86% of their salaries covered by the government. Vandendriessche says the hotel is making up the difference plus four hours of overtime staff normally work each week. \u201cOur priority is to look after the people working for us so they continue working for us when this is over,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen all this is over we will need everyone to make an effort to boost the economy. \u201cBut we wanted to do more, particularly Takashi; a chef who isn\u2019t working is like a lion in a cage. We looked at the perishable food that we didn\u2019t want to throw away and posted an appeal asking for donations of food. Within two minutes we had the first reply,\u201d he said. Kinoshita, who grew up in a Tokyo suburb, came to France in 2002 and after working under several illustrious chefs and a spell in the kitchens at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e palace, became master of his own kitchen at the Ch\u00e2teau de Courban in 2015. \u201cThe \u00e9lan of solidarity has been incredible,\u201d said Vandendriessche. \u201cWhen you see the news and you see these people who are on the front line you want to help. \u201cWe are an hour from Dijon hospital and at the moment we can only make 100 meals and deliver them once a week on a Sunday using a refrigerated van loaned by another local person. There are 300 health staff at Dijon hospital. If the lockdown goes on then hopefully every one of them will get a meal. \u201cIt\u2019s not nothing. After all, a Michelin star chef is symbolic of French gastronomy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
