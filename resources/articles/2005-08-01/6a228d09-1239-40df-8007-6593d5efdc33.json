The retail firm said the decision to close the shop in January next year followed a review of shopping trends in the High Street Kensington area, where the store is based. The American natural food company, Whole Foods Market, which bought British health food chain Fresh &amp; Wild last year, is to buy the bottom three floors (lower ground, ground and first), where it will open the Britain's first organic and health food supermarket. Associated Newspapers, owners of the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday, the Evening Standard and Metro, which already occupies the upper floors, will rent the second floor from freeholders Relsa Barkers Ltd. John Coleman, chief executive of House of Fraser, said: \"We continue to review our portfolio of stores, in some cases taking the difficult decision to close those which do not fit in with our mid- to long- term strategy. At the same time we are developing the portfolio by adding stores in strategically important locations.\" House of Fraser stressed that the closure of the \u00a38.8m store was not the beginning of the end of the chain's presence in central London. Though House of Fraser-owned Dickens &amp; Jones on Regent Street will also close in January next year, a spokesman said that was due to changes in the lease rather than trading conditions. The company, which has 51 stores nationwide, still owns three stores in central London and has also bought Beatties Group in the west Midlands and the Scottish group Jenners. House of Fraser is Britain's leading retailer of designer brands. The closure signals the changing habits of shoppers, who are more likely to head to Bond Street or to out-of-town complexes for designer goods. A spokeswoman for Whole Foods Market said the company hoped the store would replicate its success in New York as the purveyors of \"a large range of locally sourced and specialist, natural and organic food in an urban setting\". The first Barkers store was opened by John Barker in 1870 and became part of House of Fraser in 1975."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
