The man, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, called at a south London police station on Wednesday night on an unrelated matter. Scotland Yard officers arrested him and transferred him yesterday morning to Surrey police, who are investigating the attempted murder. He is being held at the county's major crime investigation centre in Staines, and a Surrey police spokeswoman confirmed that officers were searching the house where he lived. The arrest follows more than 400 phone calls to police after they issued a description of the attacker, based on information provided by Mrs Witchalls from her hospital bed. A number of names came up, giving police several leads. Detectives described the arrest as \"significant\" and a police source said: \"Certain things in the man we have arrested match up to the profile and description of the person we are looking for.\" But a press spokeswoman cautioned: \"We cannot say the case is closed at this stage. We are still looking at other lines of inquiry. There is a huge difference between making an arrest and charging someone.\" Mrs Witchalls, 26, was left for dead on a secluded country path near her home, in the idyllic village of Little Bookham, Surrey, on Wednesday after noon last week, when an attacker plunged a knife into her neck. Despite being severely paralysed from the neck down and unable to speak, she managed to convey to detectives a detailed description of the assailant, by mouthing yes and no and blinking. The part-time teacher also revealed that the attacker had got out of a car and chased her as she ran, pushing her 21-month-old son, Joseph, in his buggy. Trapped by a gate that would not open, she turned to see him holding the knife to Joseph's throat before he pulled her to the ground and stabbed her. In nine hours of interviews over two days, Mrs Witchalls described the man as aged between 20 and 35, 5ft 10in to 6ft 4in tall, with scruffy dark hair, a long pale thin face, with prominent cheekbones and bags under his eyes. He was wearing silver hoop earrings and had a deep voice, with a southern English or possibly cockney accent. When she first saw him, he was in a blue hatchback estate car. Mrs Witchalls' condition has improved dramatically, and she has now recovered some feeling her arms, although doctors are not yet sure how much movement she will regain. She is under police guard to prevent intrusions at St George's hospital in Tooting, south London, where she has had a couple of days' rest from questioning. Detectives have praised her determination to help them, and they may at some stage, depending on developments, video record an identity parade to play to her."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
