The Dutchman\u2019s players, on the other hand, were. At least to begin with, before he took them beyond fear. \u201cWhen there are doubts, people tend to seek safety in numbers, to go with the herd,\u201d Begiristain, the former Barcelona winger, says. \u201cNot Cruyff. His first solution was always to be more attacking, more expansive. Three at the back and the centre-back is Ronald Koeman? Instead of full-backs, midfielders? Every time he sought a solution, he attacked more. And when he told us what he was doing, we thought: \u2018Is he mad or what?\u2019\u201d How, then, did the coach persuade them? Begiristain laughs. \u201cBecause he is Johan Cruyff!\u201d And Johan Cruyff is everything. There may be no man who has influenced modern football like Cruyff; at Barcelona there certainly isn\u2019t. There he became the defender of a footballing faith, a deity, the man who revolutionised the club, not once but twice, and for ever; more important even than Begiristain and his team-mates could have imagined on his second coming. Cruyff gave Barcelona a new identity and a new, sporting discourse that complemented and deepened the socio-political situation he came to understand and embrace so well; came to embody, in fact. There is a Before Cruyff and an After Cruyff. As a player he led them to their first league title in 14 years; as a manager he led them to their first European Cup. The legacy is clear, profound and present. Before 1990 Barcelona had won 10 league titles in their entire history and no European Cups; since then they have won 13 leagues and five European Cups. But it is not about the trophies, or not only; it goes beyond that, to philosophy and identity. Winning, sure; a way of winning too. Cruyff the player arrived in 1973; Cruyff the manager arrived in 1988. Barcelona would never be the same again. Twice he left but he never really left. \u201cNothing in football would be possible without the arrival and the unequalled charisma and talent of Johan Cruyff,\u201d Pep Guardiola says. \u201cI\u2019m never afraid of making mistakes and I tried to bring that idea to the pitch,\u201d Cruyff said. \u201cI told players not to be afraid: \u2018If you have an idea, good: try it. And if it goes wrong, don\u2019t worry.\u2019\u201d He had practised what he preached. Cruyff, who was three times a European champion, the best player on the planet, the most talented representative of Dutch Total Football, could have signed for Real Madrid but he did not. In part because Ajax had sold him to Real Madrid. \u201cThat\u2019s unethical. I said: \u2018I decide,\u2019\u201d he recalled. He threatened to retire unless he was allowed to join Barcelona, where he knew Vic Buckingham and Rinus Michels and to whom he had already given his word. He became the most expensive player in the world but it was the best investment Barcelona ever made. The ban on foreign players finally lifted, Cruyff eventually made his debut against Granada in October 1973. Barcelona were fourth from bottom, having won only two of their seven league games, and were already out of the Uefa Cup. One magazine cover showed the new signing in flares and a striped jumper, huge shirt collar, jacket draped coolly over his shoulder. \u201cCruyff: the only hope to avoid the chaos,\u201d the headline declared. They were right. \u201cWe had gone 14 years without winning the league and cul\u00e9s had started to despair,\u201d his team-mate Charly Rexach recalls. \u201cAnd then Cruyff arrived.\u201d At the end of the season, Barcelona were champions for the first time since 1960. They had not lost a match that mattered with him in the side, going 22 unbeaten before losing twice after the title had been clinched. It was, as it turned out, the only league title he won as a player in Spain but if that is a surprising limited return in terms of silverware, the impact now looks almost limitless \u2013 particularly when Cruyff the player is recalled alongside Cruyff the manager. When he is just Cruyff. \u201cCruyff was a sensational player,\u201d says his former team-mate Juan Manuel Asensi. \u201cHe was also a winner. The change in mentality was brutal. It was like we had been drowning and now we were pulled out of the water.\u201d Cruyff recalled: \u201c[Barcelona] were always thinking about inferiority, they had Madriditis. We were always thinking we were the victim but in my way of thinking there was no victim. I said: \u2018Let\u2019s look at ourselves, let the rest do whatever they want; we know what we want.\u2019\u201d He knew what he wanted; the style was defined, one he remained faithful to as a coach as well as a player. Rexach says the change in footballing terms when he came in 1973 was \u201cradical, a revolution\u201d. He explains: \u201cBack then football was: \u2018Right, out we go: come on lads, in hard\u2019 and that was it. No one studied the opponents. It was fight, run, jump. Then it was: \u2018No, let\u2019s play better football.\u2019\u201d Cruyff was contagious, representing a radical shift at Barca, and not just on the pitch. As Asensi puts it: \u201cWith Cruyff, everything changed \u2013 the club as well as the team.\u201d He defied convention, at every level; this was not only sport, it was society. \u201cThey said I was difficult but I was not difficult, I just fought for justice,\u201d Cruyff said. \u201cI\u2019m from the post-war era; I was born in \u201947 and all the people from my age were renewing everything \u2013 take the Beatles, all those kinds of people. I have always been renewing, always challenging.\u201d He was new, exciting, different. The future Barcelona president Joan Laporta was 11 and he wanted to be Cruyff, cutting his hair like the Dutchman and copying his moves. \u201cIf I was born again, I would like to be Pep Guardiola,\u201d Laporta says. \u201cAnd I say that only because I wouldn\u2019t dare to say that I would like to be Johan Cruyff.\u201d There was something irresistibly attractive about him: artistic, bohemian and a brilliant footballer. The team\u2019s physio \u00c1ngel Mur insists: \u201cCruyff was an artist. Even those people who didn\u2019t like football stopped to watch him.\u201d Rexach says: \u201cI remember going to places like Santander, Burgos or Granada and sometimes even their own fans would have a go at their players when they fouled us. For the first time they had the chance to see a figure like Johan Cruyff in the flesh and they didn\u2019t want their centre-back to ruin the spectacle.\u201d Rexach describes Barcelona\u2019s 5-0 win over Real Madrid in February 1974 as the moment: the beginning of the current Barcelona model. In the crowd that night was Emilio Butrague\u00f1o, a Real fan and later a legend at the Bernab\u00e9u, who admitted it was Cruyff, his idol, that he had come to see. Cruyff was sensational, dominating a match that ended up having a huge political and social symbolism, one that he could only play because he had brought forward the birth of his son \u2013 a son he insisted on calling Jordi, like the patron saint of Catalonia, in spite of the resistance of the registrar. \u201cI just liked the name,\u201d he remembered, smiling a little mischievously. \u201c[At the registry office] I said: \u2018What\u2019s not allowed? I decide: I\u2019m Dutch. I decide the name of my son.\u2019\u201d Cruyff decided, always. And his decisions were so often different. \u201cIt is better to fall with your ideas than someone else\u2019s,\u201d he insisted. He did fall too but he stood above. When Cruyff took over as manager in 1988, Barcelona were a club in debt and in crisis. Results were bad, performances were worse, the atmosphere terrible and attendances down, while even the relationship between the president of the club Josep Llu\u00eds N\u00fa\u00f1ez and the president of the nation they represented, Jordi Pujol, had deteriorated. It did not work immediately but he recovered the identity he had embodied as a player. He took risks, and rewards followed. \u201cIt was a different idea, another way of looking at the game,\u201d Michael Laudrup remembers. \u201cCruyff is the only coach who would say tactical things you had never heard before and you would think: \u2018Oh, of course!\u2019 It might be logical but 90% of coaches wouldn\u2019t say the same thing. Cruyff marked us all. Barcelona teams before him were different.\u201d They were less successful, for a start. Under Cruyff, Barcelona won four league titles in a row. They also won the European Cup at last, against Sampdoria at Wembley in May 1992. Cruyff later fell out with Rexach but that night his former team-mate was his assistant coach and best friend. Rexach says winning the trophy was a \u201cliberation\u201d; their historic fatalism was finally defeated. \u201cThere were lots of people waiting for us to screw it up again,\u201d adds Rexach, \u201cand the feeling was [that] another life starts. \u201cWe were released.\u201d Mur, who was the son of the previous physiotherapist, a family dynasty at the club for over six decades, stretching right back to the civil war, says: \u201cThe responsibility was colossal and after the final the sense of release was enormous.\u201d Before it, there was tension, nerves, fear. As the players prepared for the biggest moment in their lives, and in FC Barcelona\u2019s life, Cruyff famously had one last message to deliver: \u201cSalid y disfrutad\u201d. Go out there and enjoy it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
