Psychologist Ekman, a pioneer in emotion science, describes his decades of research into the physiological changes that occur during certain emotions, and his development of a method for reading \"micro-expressions\", tiny, fleeting changes in the face that advertise feelings, which has led law-enforcement agencies to solicit his services. We get lots of photographs of the author's daughter performing small facial movements to order, and detailed illustrations of what these express. Ekman also tries to give advice on how to control your own emotions (star appearance by the Dalai Lama) and recognise them in others. It's a bit irritating, though, that the text is festooned with adverts for the author's website, which promise we will find more groovy practice material, only for it to turn out that we would have to buy his special CDs. That caused some subtle changes in the musculature of my face. SP When I Was Cool, by Sam Kashner (Century, \u00a38.99) Here's a literary rule that should be enforced with the threat of violence: only write a memoir if you have experienced something unusually interesting. Kashner passes the test, for this is the story of his time as a student at the \"Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics\" in Boulder, Colorado. He turned up in 1976 to study poetry with his idols Allen Ginsberg and William S Burroughs. The author's first student assignment comes when he is told to finish Ginsberg's poem about giving Neal Cassady a blowjob. Then he must babysit Gregory Corso (who wets the bed), study Buddhism, and hop into bed with various hippie women. Kashner tells a warm and poignant story of life with his ageing, drug-addled literary heroes (Burroughs went up in my estimation after I learned that he slept with a copy of Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage under his pillow). In the end, it seems he got an excellent education. SP The Little Earth Book, by James Bruges (Fragile Earth, \u00a36.99) Star of this book is a little cartoon fish who swims about through the paragraphs thinking big thoughts, such as \"Why don't they abolish poverty?\" or \"Citizens seem more intelligent than governments\". This is a collection of mini-essays about all the global issues that should concern any self-respecting No Logo -reading freelance protester, such as declining cod stocks, deforestation, global warming, the oil economy, the arms trade, third-world debt, the notion of a basic citizens' income, water wars and genetic patents. Bruges collates a huge range of facts and figures, and has a nice line in polemical humour, referring derisively to \"flat-earth economists\". However he does evince a slightly twee, New Agey twang, and his insistence that humans must \"live within the rules set by nature\" is either silly agrarian atavism or just meaningless - probably the latter, since he does allow that genetic engineering \"may have great benefits\". SP Shoot the Singer!, edited by Marie Korpe (Zed, \u00a315.95) You get a CD taped inside the back cover of this collection of essays about \"Music Censorship Today\", so you can listen to the cheerful, plinky waltz-time Mexican song which bigs up Osama bin Laden for frightening the Americans and relates a remarkable scene in which George Bush's wife tells him to go to Afghanistan and offer Bin Laden \"your ass\". The book does not suggest that this particular song has been censored, but it does describe how Mexico has seen many efforts to stamp out undesirable examples of the tradition of corrida , a sort of musical newspaper. Anyway, singer Andr\u00e9s Contreras should read the chapter about Bin Laden's Taliban mates, who banned all forms of music and burned musical instruments, before deciding whose side he's on. Other stories relate censorship and victimisation of musicians in Lebanon, Zimbabwe and Burma, and a few sparks of hope, such as the gradual reappearance of women musicians in Iran. SP Einstein's Refrigerator: Tales of the Hot and Cold, by Gino Segr\u00e8 (Penguin, \u00a37.99) For physicist Gino Segr\u00e8, understanding the universe \"is one of our noblest pursuits\". Using temperature as a key to unlock nature's secrets, such as the origin of life, Segr\u00e8 takes us on a journey back to the super-heated atomic furnace of the Big Bang and then on to the Big Chill of absolute zero (-273C). At such low temperatures the bizarre behaviour of atoms (as in superconductivity) can only be explained using quantum mechanics, a field in which, as Segr\u00e8 puts it, \"even the subtleties have subtleties\". Segr\u00e8's \"temperature chronicle of our universe\" is a memorable celebration of the scientific search for understanding, even if in the end all we learn is that \"we are only special in realising how ordinary we truly are\". And yes, the greatest theoretical physicist of the 20th century did design a fridge. It didn't reach the high street; the appliance of science was never Einstein's forte. PDS The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of the Earth's Antiquity, by Jack Repcheck (Pocket Books, \u00a37.99) According to Stephen Jay Gould, James Hutton \"burst the boundaries of time\". His Theory of the Earth (1795) claimed that \"with respect to human observation, this world has neither a beginning nor an end\". In other words, the Earth was not created on October 23 4004BC, as the King James Bible said, but was unimaginably ancient. This insight was crucial to Darwin and provided the timescale over which evolution could work its slow magic. Hutton also grasped the geological importance of \"subterranean heat\". Born in Edinburgh, \"the father of modern geology\" didn't have to look far: Castle Rock is the basalt core of a volcano. Repcheck succeeds wonderfully in reviving this scientific hero, but even he has to admit that Hutton's key text was so turgid that it \"simply would not be read today\". A reason, perhaps, why Hutton has been unjustly obscured by the sands of time. PDS"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
