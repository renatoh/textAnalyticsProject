Trimaan Dhillon, a British army soldier, was jailed for life in April last year for cutting the 24-year-old\u2019s throat, in what a judge at Newcastle crown court described as \u201can act of utter barbarism\u201d. Ruggles had contacted police with concerns about Dhillon\u2019s behaviour in the days before her death on 12 October 2016, but friends said she felt \u201cpalmed off\u201d by officers. Last October, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) launched an investigation into the actions of Northumbria police ahead of Ruggles\u2019 death. The report from the IOPC, published on Wednesday, found a case to answer for misconduct for a police constable for failing to appropriately investigate the report of Dhillon\u2019s stalking. They also found a case to answer for misconduct for the police sergeant for not properly supervising the constable during the investigation. \u201cAfter Northumbria police agreed with our findings, both officers were dealt with via management action in the form of words of advice, and further training to develop their awareness when dealing with stalking and harassment,\u201d said the watchdog. The IOPC also found evidence of unsatisfactory performance by another PC, who they said had \u201csince received advice on how to deal with domestic incidents via a victim-focused rather than a victim-led approach\u201d. Ruggles made her first call to the police, via 101, at 12.40am on 1 October 2016, 11 days before her death, and reported a number of incidents of unwanted contact from Dhillon, including seeing him outside her flat in Gateshead. On 2 October, a PC visited her home for two hours and took a statement in which she said she had told Dhillon she wanted no further contact with him, but that since then his actions had \u201cscared and terrified\u201d her. She detailed how on 30 September he had brought flowers and chocolates to her home, and left her a voicemail saying he did not want to kill her. The IOPC found the police constable had a case to answer for misconduct for failing to recognise Dhillon\u2019s offence as stalking, rather than harassment. \u201cOfficer B stated he did not believe there was a necessity to arrest Mr Dhillon as he had not made any direct threats, lived 120 miles away [in Edinburgh] and there had been no previous incidents of violence between the two parties. In our opinion, his logic in this assessment is not sound,\u201d the report concluded. The IOPC also found a police sergeant had a case to answer for misconduct for failing to appropriately supervise the police constable while he investigated Ruggles\u2019 report. Ruggles again contacted Northumbria police on 7 October 2016 after Dhillon sent her a letter and photographs. She was contacted by a different PC who asked if she wanted Dhillon arrested, to which Ruggles said no. The IOPC found evidence of unsatisfactory performance by the PC, saying policing guidance states that the decision to arrest a suspect lies with the officer, and victims should not be asked whether or not they want people arrested. Rachel Bacon, an assistant chief constable at Northumbria police, said the Ruggles family had helped the force develop better training. \u201cSince Alice\u2019s death it has been recognised nationally that changes need to be made in how police respond to reports of stalking and harassment to ensure officers understand the heightened risks associated with stalking behaviour,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the help of Alice\u2019s family, who I have to commend for their continuing dignity and determination, significant improvements have been made in the way we deal with these types of offences.\u201d The Ruggles family, who have established a charity in Alice\u2019s name to raise awareness of stalking, said they were pleased the IOPC had acknowledged mistakes were made, but that they \u201cnever wanted this to be turned into a blame game\u201d. \u201cSadly, police response to stalking has been shown to be inadequate in almost every area of the country and Alice\u2019s experience is not unique. It is vital that police and all areas of society take notice of this report,\u201d they said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
