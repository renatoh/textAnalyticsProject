I had one evening free, so I went to the market in the Square of the Martyrs. Talk about energy - quite apart from all the stalls selling just about everything under the sun, there were snake charmers, fire eaters and blokes banging away on drums. And all around the outside of the square there were cafes. The area that really caught my eye and tastebuds were the 70 or 80 small stands selling all kinds of food, much of which I'd never come across. On one were some snails that were new to me - quite small, the shells beige mottled with brown, these snails were served in a broth containing ginger, chilli and other spices that respected the snails' very delicate, natural, earthy flavour. They were totally wonderful. I also had spleen stuffed with barley and spices and served in the form of small sausages. Fantastic. And then I found a stall - actually, there were several - that served only sheeps' heads, rows and rows of them. A man sat in the middle of the cooking area pulling the meat off the cooked heads and roughly chopping it up. I got this little plate with a bit of tongue, cheek, temple, brain and nose. It came with a tiny bowl filled with salt and cumin, a hunk of bread and a little cup of mint tea. As I was eating, I came across a big piece of beige-coloured meat I could not identify. It was slightly spongy and quite dense at the same time, very delicate, with a slight lactic aftertaste. I asked what it was. Udder, I was told. I'm not sure I'll be rushing back for more of that, but the other things I ate? Try keeping me away. \u00b7 Heston Blumenthal is chef/proprietor of the Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
