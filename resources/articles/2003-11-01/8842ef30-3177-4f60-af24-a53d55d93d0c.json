Promotional leaflets praised its history and geography, and 'exotic blend' of religious, cultural and archaeological sites. Spring is recommended as the best time to visit, and the biggest health risk for travellers is said to be sunburn or an upset stomach. The Foreign Office continues to warn against travel to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where seven Britons have been killed since 2000. The FO states: 'The risk of terrorist attacks within Israel and the Occupied Territories, including Jerusalem remains very high.' A Palestinian tourist board spokesman at the show said dejectedly: 'You come here and look around and everywhere everybody is doing business. Palestine was a very popular place for tourists to visit. Now, numbers are very low. We just wanted to come here to say to people that Palestine is safe for tourists to visit.' Tourism workers from Palestine had been in friendly discussions about the political situation with Israeli workers whose stall was nearby. Palestine has a wide range of tourist attractions, most of them in the West Bank in Bethlehem, Jericho and Jerusalem. The Basilica of the Nativity, a church built above the stable where Jesus was said to have been born, is in Bethlehem, while Jerusalem has ancient city walls and the Muslim holy site of Haram al-Sharif where prophet Mohammed is said to have risen to heaven. European visitors can take a 58-hour ferry from Piraeus, Greece, to Haifa, or fly from Morocco to Gaza. Accommodation options include the Seven Arches Hotel in Jerusalem (00 972 2626 7777) or the Bethlehem Star Hotel (00 972 2274 3249). A spokeswoman from the Association of British Travel Agents said: 'At the moment our members should not be sending people there.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
