Gordon Brown wants to take Britain. His desire to move from 11 to 10 Downing Street is so palpable that 'lust' is a better description. The appetite is matched only by the Chancellor's craving to follow the Washington consensus of the International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organisation and privatise regardless of the cost to taxpayers or the miseries inflicted on the citizen. Brown's desires, like those of many of us, are contradictory and self-destructive. Nothing can stem his determination to part-privatise the London Underground. His wish will probably be granted - our system ensures that the elected dictatorship triumphs in the short term. If it is, however, he may find on the day after Tony Blair falls under a merchant banker that he's lost the capital and with it the country. On the first morning of Ken Livingstone's attempt to get the courts to stop the Chancellor causing unnecessary harm, I caught a whiff in the air I haven't smelt for years. The protesters who cheered Livingstone into the High Court, hated Brown. Many politicians are despised, but there's usually a strong irrational element mingled in the venom. The loathing of Brown last week was of a type few politicians have experienced since Margaret Thatcher forced the poll tax on Scotland. It was reasoned hatred against the caprice of an alien power. No one in Scotland supported the poll tax with the exception of the wealthy and few Conservative toads. No one in London supports the private-public partnership for the Tube with the exception of the lucky conglomerates, which will receive a guaranteed income from passengers and the public at an extortionate rate for 30 years, and a few New Labour toads (who sound more like their Tory predecessors the longer they croak in the swamp). Everyone else is against Brown: business and the unions, the City and the suburbs, accountants and academics, radicals and reactionaries. New Labour said it wanted to transcend the tired arguments of Left and Right and bring everyone together in a big, warm tent. In London, Brown's done just that. The case against the Balkanisation of the London Underground isn't merely a metropolitan concern. The arguments against are identical to the arguments against Private Finance Initiative in health and education. We'll get to the detail later. Those who don't want to struggle to understand why the cant of the Treasury is fraudulent can move to Pendennis once they have noted that the Government tacitly accepts its opponents are right. Underground privatisation has become an orphan. Lobby correspondents report that John Prescott and Stephen Byers refuse to defend the project and blame Brown - quite rightly, incidentally. According to the Financial Times, 'Treasury insiders' are 'making a concerted effort to distance Gordon Brown' from the Underground and say - quite ludicrously, incidentally - that Prescott and Byers are at fault. 'A small voice' close to Blair tells the Times that the PM 'would not mind' if the High Court ruled against the Government. 'It would get him off the hook, bloody Mr Brown's nose and leave Mr Livingstone hanging in the wind with the Tube round his neck.' My colleagues in Westminster will mystify readers by ploughing through the Masonic lexicon of 'insiders' and 'small voices' until the day they die, believe me. (Wittgenstein was mistaken: the Lobby proves you can have a private language.) The wider picture they're missing is this: whatever the judge decides, privatisation will go on and Brown will give vast amounts of public money to conglomerates; Brown will not defend his policy because he knows it will be a disaster; Tony Blair knows it too, but the Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury won't intervene and protect Londoners - he'd rather see them suffer and let his rivals take the blame. The personal has corrupted the political. None of these vulgar considerations can concern the High Court. Although we often hear wails about power passing to the unelected judiciary, what I noticed at the hearing was legal impotence. Mr Justice Sullivan, whose decision is expected tomorrow, can't stop the Private-Public Partnership, all he can do is soften the terms. Livingstone and Bob Kiley, who scored over Brown and Prescott in Boston and New York by proving he can run a railway, say they are being forced into an unlawful quandary. The London Mayor is legally responsible for running a 'safe, integrated, efficient and economic' Tube. He can't do anything of the sort when the Treasury insists that track, signals and stations be given to three conglomerates for 30 years which will then rent back to the public what we thought we owned. The talk in the court was of coordination. Who will be in control? What will happen if the private consortiums don't give priority to repairing escalators in the most sweltering and crammed stations? Or skimp on essential work? These are good questions and if the judge finds in his favour, the companies will be answerable to Kiley. Unfortunately, the judge couldn't ask a better one: Why on earth should we and the next generation pay through the nose for a gigantic system of outdoor relief for inept businesses? Brown's reputation is built on Presbyterian rectitude. Everyone knows he's a tight man with money, but what may be a fault in others is prudence in a Chancellor handling public funds. His private initiatives contradict the laziness of received wisdom. Private finance for the public sector is raised by companies borrowing to 'invest'. It costs them far more to borrow than the state. They must also recoup their outlay and take their profits from the rent they charge for decades. As a result, the first 14 privately financed hospitals built under New Labour saw a 33 per cent reduction in beds on average as wards were closed to cope with the escalating costs of wanton Presbyterianism. The Underground is no different. The Government once said its new model Tube wouldn't need public grants. Now it accepts the taxpayer will have fork out more than when the service was publicly controlled - as with the privatised railways. If the consortia give abysmal service - and their vague and indulgent contracts give every incentive to skim profits - they can't be sacked because prudent Mr Brown forces the public sector to meet all their debts if penalties for shabby service drive the corporations into bankruptcy. London is a Labour city with 74 seats. Its inhabitants are notorious for their sharpness. If I wanted to be Prime Minister I would think I was pushing it if I asked them and their MPs and their trade unions for support when I'd picked their pockets. \u0095 I said last week that ITV's puffery for the Alpha course would begin last Sunday. It actually starts tonight. My apologies. Protest, once a legitimate means of raising ideas in a free society, is now anti-democratic. Protesters against, for example, the arms bazaar are rich, white, hypocrites. The leaders and chief executives they demonstrate against for flooding the developing world with arms, are black, working-class altruists. Coverage of Genoa was 'invidious', said Jack Straw, because it 'insinuated that there is some moral equivalence between protesters, including violent protesters, and democratically elected governments'. Mr Straw's Government has a crushing majority despite receiving the votes of a mere one in four adults. The claims of George W.Bush to be democratically elected remain contested. Silvio Berlusconi, the host at Genoa, was able to seize power because of the relentless propaganda from the mass media he controls. Berlusconi is in alliance with the heirs of Mussolini. The police of his partly 'post-fascist' administration shot an unarmed demonstrator dead. They jumped on sleeping protesters in the middle of the night and delivered thrashings which put the innocent in hospital. The cops' job, sighed a sympathetic Tony Blair, was 'very difficult'. Clare Short agreed with Straw that peaceful protesters were almost as bad as violent anarchists. Charities were staffed by 'almost all-white people from privileged countries' who wasted money 'going on big demonstrations' in the vain hope they might influence governments and corporations. Jubilee 2000 campaigners weren't merely lily-white spendthrifts, added the Prime Minister. They were ingrates who didn't grasp the sheer bloody hard work the working-class heroes who run global capitalism endure for the benefit of mankind. 'Most of us, I think, if we're normal human beings, would prefer this weekend to be with our own families,' he said. 'I mean, I'm starting this morning about 6.30 English time and will go on probably to about midnight.' I think the PM is missing the point. No one takes to the streets to march against his working hours. Most believe the world would be a far happier place if he stayed in bed all day and did less damage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
