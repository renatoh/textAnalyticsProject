A webcam, of course. You can find a comprehensive collection at snoweye.com. Even the obscure Lebanese resorts have relaunched their joint website (skileb.com) with snowcams, though one of them still shows a snowy April 15. Resorts love webcams. They don't need to be translated and they can be trained to focus on the most alluring and reliable run. Always bear in mind that it is in the ski resort's interest to present the most flattering image of its snow cover and sunniness. There are more reliable ways of monitoring the weather in your chosen resort. New snow If you've booked a flight to, say, Geneva, but are waiting until the last minute to choose a resort and accommodation, SkiCentral has an up-to-date page listing the latest dumps Skicentral.com/newsnow.html and IgluSki (igluski.com/snow reports.cfm) will resume its reports (with upper and lower snow depths) today. If you plan to ski in the US, OnTheSnow.com sends out a Ski Mail as often as you require it with reports from a nominated state. IfYouSki.com publishes an excellent overview of the best skiing in a particular country right now; it's provided by the Ski Club of Great Britain, which provides the same information to registered users. Natives encourages users to send in their own reports (natives.co.uk/whatsnew/moresnow.htm) - 'Just to let you know, it's fully dumping in Cham/Argenti\u00e8re...' and publishes a more informal, jokey round-up:natives.co.uk/whatsnew/snowrep.htm. Text alerts Natives.co.uk sends 10 daily text messages on conditions in a designated resort. The sign-up call costs around \u00a34.50. TheSkiClub service only sends five, although it's a bit difficult to work out how much they will end up costing. Weather forecasts Even more importantly, what will the weather be like while you're there? Fierce blizzards demand extra layers and goggles; balmy sunshine indicates even more sunblock. IfYouSki.com has good three and six-day resort reports. The BBC's skiing forecasts are generally good, but its winter site hasn't launched yet. Check bbc.co.uk/weather/sports/skiing/ later this month. A few of the more hardcore resorts, notably Chamonix and Whistler do publish really detailed forecasts in English. ros.taylor@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
