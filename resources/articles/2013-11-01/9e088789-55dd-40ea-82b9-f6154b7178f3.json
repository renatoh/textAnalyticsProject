Eva Birthistle (from Loach's Ae Fond Kiss \u2026) is the Scots lass who gets one scene establishing her anti-capitalist credentials before she's whisked to Cuba to scatter her father's ashes. The journey is meant as a renewal of the countries' socialist bonds, but the script conceives this process in blandly literal terms by having Birthistle fall for local hunk Carlos Acosta. The pair's pan-Cuban pan-Cuban mooning occasions mucho guitar-strumming, yet nothing much catches fire: lame gags and supporting turns ensure it concludes closer to Mamma Mia! than Marx."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
