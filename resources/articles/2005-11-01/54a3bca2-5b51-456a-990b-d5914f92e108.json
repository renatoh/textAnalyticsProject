The move is part of the government's crackdown on alcohol misuse which has been timed to coincide with the change of the licensing laws, which happened first thing today. The new laws for England and Wales, which allow many pubs and clubs to stay open longer, and some to serve 24 hours a day, had a quiet introduction last night. But police forces around the country, which reported no increase in alcohol-related offences last night, said the real test of the new rules would come at the weekend. The tactic of using undercover officers to police some premises was revealed by Devon and Cornwall police, which said it would be an \"effective policy\". A spokesman said: \"Licensees should be aware this undercover operation will be going on.\" The powers to fine staff for serving drunks were introduced earlier this year but have yet to be used substantially by the police. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport said that police were being encouraged to use the new powers in the crackdown on alcohol misuse which began last week and will go on until after Christmas. The government - which has been accused of taking a risk of worsening the UK's problems with binge drinking by allowing longer opening times - has provided police and other authorities with \u00a32.5m in extra resources to tackle alcohol misuse. The culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, has said that drunken revellers who commit anti-social behaviour will also be fined \u00a380 and that they could be caught by CCTV systems scanning city centres. The government says the new legislation and a series of other measures will also give police and local authorities greater powers to clamp down on businesses which fuel alcohol misuse over the festive period. Premises involved with irresponsible drinks promotions could have their licences revoked, and stores caught selling alcohol to minors could have their licences changed, suspended or revoked and face a \u00a35,000 fine. A series of 5,500 Trading Standards sting operations will also take place in the run-up to Christmas in a bid to catch retailers who sell alcohol to minors. Home Office officials say that the changes will be judged by their impact on the rate of serious assaults in the violent crime figures. They hope that a 9% fall recorded in areas targeted in a summer alcohol campaign will be replicated across the country. Among the 190,000 licensed premises in England and Wales, around 70,000 pubs, clubs and stores have been granted longer opening hours and more than 1,000 have been granted 24-hour licences. Last night a few pubs that had been granted extended hours called time at 11pm for the last time and began serving again just after midnight, when the new laws came into effect. But the overwhelming majority of pubs and bars chose to close as usual. In Newcastle and Nottingham, reporters said the new laws arrived with a whimper rather than a bang and streets cleared early. In Nottingham, those pubs that stayed open late found the majority of people friendly and relatively sober, reporters said. Those who were drinking more heavily headed to nightclubs before midnight, to take advantage of cheaper entry prices. One woman, who was heading for a nightclub to celebrate her 26th birthday said she and her friends backed the law changes. \"It's not just so we can binge drink into the early hours. We hate coming out of a club at 2am and having to queue for taxis with people from the other clubs and bars. \"That's when the trouble starts, when everyone gets kicked out together. Staggering kicking-out time can only improve things.\" Police in Nottingham streets praised the way the city coped. By midnight, many streets were deserted, with just a few remaining customers left in the city's Lace Market district, where 1am midweek curfews are nothing new. In Newcastle, publicans also reported a quiet night. Police were keeping a low profile in the city, where no pubs or clubs have been granted a licence to open 24 hours a day. The latest closing time in the city will be 4am. No trouble was reported in Bristol, which has been chosen as a government \"pilot area\". Ministers will monitor the impact of the new regulations on the city closely over the next few months. Six venues and four supermarkets have been granted 24-hour licences in the city. The Railway Hotel pub, in Blandford Forum, Dorset, stayed open until 3.45am (Guardian reporter Patrick Barkham lasted until around 2am before retiring after drinking a \"generous helping of Badgers\"). The pub's landlord, Nigel Jones, said: \"Of course it's not going to turn us into alcoholics. Binge drinking is about people drinking too much in a short space of time. It's nothing to do with giving people extended licensing laws and longer to drink.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
