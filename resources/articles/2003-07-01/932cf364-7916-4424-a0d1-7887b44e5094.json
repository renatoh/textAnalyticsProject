The South Africa team that Nasser Hussain had judged were \"ripe for the taking\" did all the commandeering themselves. No cricketing country inflicts reality checks more determinedly than South Africa. All the talk had centred on Darren Gough's heroic conquering of a career-threatening injury, Andrew Flintoff's maturing into a world-class all-rounder, and James Anderson's ability to sex-up a game aching to be trendy. Yesterday the talking stopped and the suffering - silent and prolonged - began. Gough, Flintoff and Anderson combined for nought for 209 in 43 overs. A draining repetition of Gibbs pulls and Smith clips off his hips, was watched with resignation. Smith and Gibbs, opening partners for Western Province, are the first Test openers to have shared in two triple-hundred stands. And the shot that brought them a record South African opening stand against England completed the hosts' deflating day, when Marcus Trescothick half stopped Gibbs' edge into the slips off Steve Harmison and broke a finger. As injuries go, \"a small undisplaced fracture of the tip of his finger\" sounds small beer, but it will keep Trescothick off the field for the rest of the South Africa innings, after which a decision will be taken. The way things are going, that should give him ample time for a full recovery. \"It's a pretty minor fracture,\" was the opinion of England's coach Duncan Fletcher, who bemoaned the team's lack of discipline. \"They are young, attacking bowlers and should have gone into defensive mode,\" he said. \"They were not precise enough. We have played a lot of one-day cricket.\" County chairmen incensed by Fletcher's rest policy after the one-day series will delight in Smith's suggestion that England's bowlers were still in one-day mode precisely because \"they hadn't played any championship cricket\". This was the day that Gibbs came to terms with England. He was slowhandclapped for taking nine overs to get off the mark, but at Test level he has become durable where once he was reckless. \"Once I got through the first hour it was just a matter of getting my balance back, and what better time to do it?\" Smith dubbed Gibbs the Mayor of Cape Town, in recognition of the sporting stardom that gets doors opened and problems solved. But Gibbs prefers designer chains to chains of office; it is Smith who even at 22 conveys the nous of a man twice his age. Hussain's call for England to enter \"Test-match mode\" was not intended to signal a switch from one-day vigour to five-day demoralisation, from arms held high in triumph to hands on hips in despair. But it did. Last night Smith vowed to check what records South Africa might yet conquer. Their highest score, 622 for nine against Australia in Durban in 1969-70, is within range. But with rain forecast today, it may have to wait."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
