The appointment, to be announced by Health Secretary Alan Milburn, will showcase the Prince's passionate opposition to poor architecture, views he has voiced for almost three decades. The post will give him considerable influence over all plans and designs that form part of the Government's new NHS building programme. In a move that will send a shudder through the cliquey world of building design, the Prince will hold regular meetings with construction firms involved in the programme, which includes more than 50 major projects. Sources said Ministers and the Prince were particularly interested in research that shows well-planned hospitals speed up patient recovery. An aide told The Observer : 'The initiative was very much his own idea. He will be talking to firms directly.' It is hoped his appointment will help avoid embarrassing design flaws like those at the new Cumberland Infirmary, opened by Tony Blair in June, which has a glass roof but no air conditioning. Consequently, when it is sunny the temperature for both patients and staff is unbearable. Charles's forays in the architectural world have not always proved successful. Plans for an eco-friendly model village in the Hebrides were scrapped because they cost too much. He is currently opposing plans to alter London's skyline with a string of new skyscrapers. Last year, in a \u00a340 million initiative, food critic Loyd Grossman was drafted in to improve hospital catering, but some patients have requested a return of pie and mash to replace Loyd's couscous and Parmesan fried chicken escalopes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
