Yet he remains confident that the winger can go on to restore his reputation as a Manchester United player. Ronaldo returned to training at United's Carrington base on Monday and is understood to have made his peace with Rooney, at the instigation of the manager Sir Alex Ferguson. However, the Portuguese is braced to endure a torrid return to the first team - possibly in a friendly against Oxford United on Tuesday - with opposing supporters unlikely to let him forget the part he played in his club-mate's red card in Gelsenkirchen. The 21-year-old has already been subjected to death threats since the incident, though Charlton is adamant his only means of restoring his reputation is by remaining at Old Trafford. \"Ronaldo is a good player, a marvellous young player,\" said the United director. \"He has come back here and I've no doubt he has already spoken to Wayne. He realises he has made a mistake which he will have to pay for. I'm sure the fans will have a little go at the start of the season. Nevertheless, I don't see how he could have solved the problem in any other way than by coming back to us. \"If he had wanted to go and force us to send him off to Real Madrid or wherever, he would have had the same problem and it may never have gone away. The only way it will ever go away is if he comes back here, plays alongside Wayne, does well for United and is seen to be working really hard to put right the little errors he has made. He's only a young lad. He's inexperienced and does not know a lot about the game but he will be better for it. The only place he can solve the problem is here. It might be difficult at the beginning but he is a great player and that's what people should think about.\" Real were joined by Valencia in apparent pursuit of the winger, though both clubs will be frustrated in their attempts to sign the Portuguese. \"Cristiano is our player,\" said Charlton. \"He has signed a contract and we will keep him to it. \"The more he thinks about it, the more he will realise he is in the right place. I do not have it in my mind that he would go anywhere else. Never ever. He's a great player and he's our player. I know he is on a reasonably good contract. Maybe his agent was trying to find a place for him to go to but I never took it seriously that he was going to leave. He is young and wants to be successful but at the end of the day he will be glad he has stayed with us.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
