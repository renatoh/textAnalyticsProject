A study published in the British Medical Journal contrasts the radical reorganisation of stroke care which took place in London with a compromise arrangement in Manchester, where there were no unpopular hospital closures. There was also no reduction in mortality. If Manchester had adopted the London model, 50 more lives a year would be saved, researchers estimate. The study was carried out by academics at UCL, the University of Manchester, King's College London and the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. It was commissioned by the National Institute for Health Research and funded by the Department of Health. The results of the study are likely to influence other reorganisations of stroke care that are taking place \u2013 in Birmingham and Coventry, for instance. Manchester is also now moving towards a more centralised system. The findings will bolster the arguments of clinicians who say fewer, more specialised centres are the way to go, not only in stroke care but also in other fields such as trauma. London adopted its new system in 2010. Anybody suffering a stroke is taken to one of eight hyperacute stroke units (HASUs) located in hospitals that are no more than a 30-minute ambulance journey from anywhere in the capital. That often means bypassing the closest A&amp;E. The HASUs are open day and night, with specialist stroke staff, clot-busting treatment and immediate access to brain scans available. In 24 hospitals stroke units have become rehabilitation centres and in five they have been closed. Greater Manchester, with a smaller population, has three specialist centres, only one of which is open 24/7. People who suffer a stroke are taken to a specialist centre only if they are seen within four hours of developing symptoms \u2013 with a view to being given clot-busting drugs. Otherwise they are taken to one of the 10 district stroke centres. Stroke survival has improved all over the country, but more markedly in London, say the researchers, who looked at data from 258,915 stroke admissions across England from 2008 to 2012, including 17,650 in Greater Manchester and 33,698 in London. They found that the length of hospital stay dropped in both cities, but mortality reduced only in London. \"The changes in London save around 96 stroke patients every year who would likely have died under a non-centralised system,\" said lead author Professor Stephen Morris, of the UCL department of applied health research. \"Centralisation in London reduced death rates by 1.1% at 90 days after stroke after adjusting for confounding factors including improved survival nationwide. Against a backdrop of increasing stroke survival across England, looking only at changes in survival in both areas before and after centralisation is not an accurate measure of the impact of the changes. The 96 patients per year figure represents the additional lives saved by centralisation over and above the lives saved by improvements to stroke care nationally.\" If the same reduction in death rates was achieved in Greater Manchester, he said, \"it would produce approximately 50 fewer deaths per year\". Senior author Professor Naomi Fulop, of UCL, said the stroke clinicians had been highly committed to improving services in both cities. \"I think it is quite remarkable what they have achieved in London because of political issues, but it is also an extremely complex reorganisation,\" she said. Alan Campbell, senior responsible officer for stroke centralisation at NHS Salford clinical commissioning group, said: \"We welcome this research, which adds extra impetus to our existing plans to further centralise hyperacute stroke services in Greater Manchester. The researchers acknowledge the potential that the greater reductions in stroke mortality in London may have been influenced by variations in stroke severity, travel distances and public awareness of stroke but their findings still add to the rationale for further centralisation in Greater Manchester.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
