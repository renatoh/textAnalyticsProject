The Football's Association disciplinary committee rejected the case against his sending-off - his sixth in England - for a two-footed tackle on Tottenham's No\u00e9 Pamarot on Sunday. The referee Phil Dowd produced a straight red card, much to McClaren's annoyance, which led to the club's request for a second opinion. Queudrue will miss City's visit to the Riverside Stadium, as well as Southampton on December 11 and Aston Villa a week later. George Boateng will also be missing on Monday following his fifth booking of the season at White Hart Lane. The FA yesterday dismissed suggestions that Middlesbrough's midfielder Stewart Downing missed out on a call-up to Sven-Goran Eriksson's last England squad because of commercial obligations. \"I can assure all Middlesbrough fans that Stewart Downing was not left out for any other reason than that which Sven has already stated,\" said the FA spokesman Adrian Bevington. \"Further to discussions with Steve McClaren and Peter Taylor before the Spain fixture, it was felt he would benefit more through being with the under-21 side.\" Lee Hendrie has lost an appeal against his sending off against Manchester City on Sunday and will serve a three-match suspension. The Aston Villa midfielder could face further punishment on being charged with improper conduct for failing to leave the pitch promptly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
