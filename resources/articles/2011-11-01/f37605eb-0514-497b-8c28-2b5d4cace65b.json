Please don't read on if you haven't seen episode two \u2013 and if you've seen further in the series, please be aware that other viewers may not have done. Rebecca Nicholson's episodes one and two blog \"Ich bin ein Berliner\" and \"Eastern Exposure\" Despite the onslaught of criticism its debut received, I'm enjoying Pan Am. It's not clever, it's not realistic, it's got more anachronisms than The Hour and its \"inspirational\" dialogue is thuddingly absurd. But it's a retro Desperate Housewives with pop feminism and nice scenery. It's frivolous, escapist fun. Maggie Plucky Maggie worked on John F Kennedy's election campaign. We find this out through a series of remarkably excitable facial expressions that are supposed to convey Christmas morning wonder but make her look as if she's on the verge of falling to the tarmac in a state of slobbering catatonia. Still, she gets a wave at the end of her mission to meet JFK, tells off the Village Voice journalist who can't understand why a stewardess would be reading \"the voice of bohemia\", and later, moves sweet, innocent Laura into her smoke-free bohemian apartment. Kate Plucky Kate's intelligence career is taking off, despite her almost bungling every job she's had so far thanks to nerves and ineptitude, and her insubordinance, and her recklessness, and her lack of regard for international protocol. Still, she saved her German cohort's life, bought her sister a camera and managed to keep both her job as a stewardess and as a \"courier\", so it's another decent double bill for Nancy Flew. No? OK then. My apologies. Laura Plucky Laura manages not to fall for Ted's slightly creepy charms, yet, and instead spends much of the time in Burma being taken in by Maggie's libertarian ways (she's not scared of lizards!), realising she shouldn't be clinging to Kate quite so closely, and deciding to stand on her own two feet, by moving into the cleanest-looking commune in all of history. Colette Plucky Colette has no family, she tells Dean (known as Captain America from here on), and on her first trip to Berlin, we learn why: they were killed during the Nazi occupation of France. So Colette gets drunk and realises she hasn't forgiven the Germans at all, and sings Deutschland Uber Alles at a posh presidential party \u2013 a moment that crackled with sadness, thanks to Karine Vanasse's decent acting. The men I don't really care about Ted or Captain America yet, even given Ted's tragic military back story, and there was too much of them in the second episode tonight. Their bromance would lend itself nicely to fan-fiction of an unwholesome sort, however. Notes and observations \u2022 As a reformed nervous flyer, the Hong Kong landing approach unsurprisingly brought back some of the old wobbles. But of course Captain A had it all under control. He's no Captain Phil from my Flying Without Fear course, mind you. \u2022 This is one of the things that makes it easy to be critical about Pan Am, but the fact that Laura and Kate's big emotional scene was hinged on Laura still wearing bunny slippers was hilarious. \u2022 I'm enjoying the fact that international espionage appears to be the shopping list episode of The Apprentice, only with more air miles. \u2022 Clunky line of the week? Ted's \"We make our own luck happen.\" \u2022 Guilty enjoyment of a clunky line of the week? Maggie's \"We are the American dream, but alas, merely your fantasy.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
