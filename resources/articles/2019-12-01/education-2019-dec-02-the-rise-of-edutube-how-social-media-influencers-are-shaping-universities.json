This year the college at which he studies, St Cuthbert\u2019s, has been oversubscribed for the first time. He\u2019s been told that the college principal thinks this is no coincidence: she\u2019s calling it \u201cthe Jack Edwards effect\u201d. Despite his popularity, Edwards says people are often surprised to find he has no relationship with the university \u2013 for instance through speaking at open days or contributing to its prospectus. While he appreciates the authenticity this lends his videos, he thinks it\u2019s a missed opportunity for Durham. \u201cPeople are watching these videos and it gives them reassurance that [the university] is a good option,\u201d he says. Despite Edwards\u2019s experience, YouTube is becoming an increasingly important platform for universities. Videos posted by the 20 universities with the highest-viewed content on the site were seen 58.9m times, according to social video measurement platform Tubular Labs; that\u2019s only marginally more than the number of views on videos posted by independent influencers about universities (49.2m). And it\u2019s a growing space: university-related content posted by influencers has seen views increase by 20% in the last year alone. \u201cUniversities are looking to platforms that their target audiences spend the most time on. Viewership figures show that they\u2019re finding those audiences on YouTube,\u201d explains Denis Crushell, a managing director at Tubular Labs. \u201cThis will continue to develop into a crucial channel for educational content as well as promotional. We\u2019re seeing that already with influencers and vloggers using the platform to talk about their experiences on campus, and tips on how to make the most out of university life.\u201d Like Edwards, Eve Cornwell, a 22-year-old trainee solicitor, is a successful vlogger who gained 239,0000 subscribers while studying at Bristol University and the University of Law. She considers herself part of a community of \u201cEduTube\u201d or \u201cStudyTube\u201d creators, who record themselves learning information for a test or completing an essay to inspire other students grappling with their workloads. \u201cI think universities and more traditional educational institutions are slowly realising the power that influencers can bring,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople like to watch another person online going through something similar to them \u2013 that idea of relatability. They can feel like they\u2019re part of you learning, or graduating, or getting your degree.\u201d It\u2019s not just students who are producing influential education content on YouTube \u2013 graduates and academics are too. Simon Clark, a 29-year-old graduate of Oxford and the University of Exeter, uploads physics, science and climate-based content to his 245,000 subscribers. His videos were among the first to feature on-screen citations \u2013 as if they were an academic paper \u2013 and go further in depth than many popular science videos. But they don\u2019t shy away from pop culture either: one video posted last year used the laws of planetary physics to work out whether planets in the Star Wars universe could actually exist. \u201cSometimes people just want to watch five minutes of a video and go, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s interesting!\u2019. It\u2019s a dinner party quote \u2013 the kind of thing you can say: \u2018Did you know?\u2019 rather than an education,\u201d he says. He prefers his output to be academically rigorous: \u201cI was frustrated seeing people do these pithy, 10-minute isolated videos.\u201d Clark\u2019s channel inspired another popular science vlogger and physics graduate, Andrew Dotson, to set up an account covering some of the most complicated concepts in physics for 110,000 subscribers. But he\u2019s noticed that putting science videos on YouTube doesn\u2019t necessarily make the concepts more accessible. Out of his range of content, the funny videos taking a sideways look at science get millions of views, the vlogs of his university experience receive hundreds of thousands, and the educational physics clips usually just pull in a few thousand. A challenge for viewers can be figuring out which videos are genuinely educational and which are hate speech or conspiracy packaged up as respectable content. Clark\u2019s videos about the climate emergency (the subject of his PhD in theoretical atmospheric physics at Exeter) compete for views against those of climate change deniers who profess to be fellow EduTubers. YouTube has heavily promoted its educational content, and last year announced \u00a315m worth of investment in grants for creators providing high-quality output. But social media \u2013 YouTube included \u2013 often fails to identify problematic content. Stefan Molyneux, for instance, is a far-right nationalist YouTuber with nearly a million subscribers who claims that black people are genetically inferior. While PayPal has suspended his account, through which he received donations for his videos and podcast, YouTube is yet to do the same. Likewise, a raft of purportedly educational documentaries peddle conspiracy theories about crucial historical events on YouTube, such as PragerU, which promotes highly conservative educational videos around race and gender under the guise of being educational. For Dotson, the benefits of producing content that can help students understand a subject in more depth or decide which campus to spend three to four years of their life at outweigh the drawbacks. \u201cI like to think I\u2019m helping the people,\u201d he says. He\u2019s also sanguine about the fact his university hasn\u2019t yet approached him to collaborate. \u201cMy goal isn\u2019t to make the university run any more smoothly \u2013 it\u2019s to help the students.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
