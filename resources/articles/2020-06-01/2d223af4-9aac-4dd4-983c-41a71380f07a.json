I have a family. This is the family that I\u2019m responsible for,\u2019\u201d he says. He and Danielle were officially a team. \u201cThat\u2019s the difference between going out together, being engaged, or whatever happened before that. After that day, it was like, \u2018All right. This is the team. The family is formed. Onwards.\u2019\u201d Danielle, on the other hand, was nervous: \u201cMarriage didn\u2019t seem like a good thing. And yet, I followed my gut a little bit in that this guy was worth jumping off that cliff for.\u201d While neither are especially sporty, the Melbourne couple met at a football game at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1999. Frank had moved down from far-north Queensland and was living in a share house with some of Danielle\u2019s friends. That night, after the football, everyone ended up at a nearby bar. \u201cFrank was the only new person to join the group. And at this bar, he was witty, charming and a really good conversationalist. But the biggest thing was that he was funny,\u201d Danielle remembers, \u201cI could tell that he was actually a very introverted person. And yet, here he was, he was almost holding court with my friends.\u201d Danielle offered to show him around (\u201cI was putting the moves on him,\u201d she jokes) and suggested a day trip to the Twelve Apostles. \u201cIt was one of those days when you just talk a lot. You talk and you talk. And you get back to Melbourne and you could still keep talking,\u201d she says. The more time they spent together, the more they realised they had in common. They both wanted more out of life than the treadmill of work, marriage and children. And as analytical problem-solvers, they both like planning for the future. \u201cIt\u2019s really helped us be on the same page all the time \u2026 Having that discussion about where we\u2019re going and what we want to achieve has really helped,\u201d says Danielle. They moved in together and then got married. They both wanted to travel and work overseas and Frank was the first to get a job, so they moved to Paris in early 2004. However neither knew anyone in the city or spoke French. \u201cWhen we moved to Paris, I remember thinking: \u2018If we can get through this, then we\u2019re probably OK\u2019, because this is the sort of stressor that could break up a couple,\u201d says Danielle. \u201cThere are a lot of challenges moving into a country like France when you don\u2019t speak the language ... There\u2019s a lot of bureaucracy that you have to get through. It\u2019s not a holiday.\u201d Frank\u2019s calmness steadied her and the couple lived in France for the next five years. Things got more challenging when their daughter Bella was born in Paris in 2007. She was premature, arriving at just 28 weeks. Danielle had an emergency caesarean section and both mother and baby were in intensive care, but in different parts of a very big hospital. As he dashed across the hospital, Frank kept telling himself everything was under control. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t allow my mind to wander to like, \u2018Well, what\u2019s going to happen in the next week or the next couple of weeks?\u2019 It really was, \u2018We\u2019ve just got to now take things a day at a time. See what tomorrow brings\u2019, especially with Bella in ICU. That\u2019s all you can do.\u201d Eventually Danielle went home, but Bella stayed in hospital for a few months. Although they were worried, it gave them time to get used to being parents. And when she finally arrived, the couple doted on her, although they maintained their own strong bond. \u201cAs a family, we\u2019re really tight. And I think when Bella was born, as this new person into a relationship, we focused on her a lot, but we still were together.\u201d She adds: \u201cFrank and I had five years together before we had Bella. And that gave us the foundations that we needed.\u201d They made sure they had time to themselves, employing nannies and babysitters as many French families do. \u201cThat\u2019s worked really well for us because then we still get date night and we still do the things that we like to do,\u201d says Danielle. \u201cThe other thing \u2013 and this is a challenge for a lot of families \u2013 when you only have one child, your life isn\u2019t impacted the same way as if you have two or three. It\u2019s just so much easier.\u201d Frank was offered his dream job in Malmo, Sweden, a few years later, and the couple decided to accept \u2013 with one proviso. \u201cI said, \u2018I need to find a job in Scandinavia. And if I don\u2019t find something in six months, we need to go back to Australia or do something else,\u2019\u201d says Danielle. \u201cIf I said, \u2018No, this isn\u2019t working, we need to go,\u2019 I knew he would leave.\u201d However Sweden was very different from France. It was one of their most challenging times as a couple, says Frank, particularly in the depths of their third bleak winter: \u201cWe were nowhere near as connected with Sweden as we had been in France in terms of local friends, connection to the local society,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a loneliness, but it was kind of an isolation where now the two of us together weren\u2019t enough.\u201d Added to that, it was supposed to be his dream job but he wasn\u2019t enjoying it: \u201cI felt the responsibility to make it work for Danielle as well.\u201d Danielle wasn\u2019t aware of his isolation. At the time her job was in Denmark, and she was settling well, while Frank was feeling stuck in Sweden. \u201cI had some really great friends and a really great time in Denmark. And I think Frank was suffering with depression. And he was all alone in it,\u201d she says. After a family holiday and much discussion, they decided to return to Melbourne. They did import many European traditions however, including a healthy work-life balance. \u201cThis links back to our values. We both feel really strongly that our home is where the three of us are. Home can be anywhere. But if we\u2019re not all together, then it\u2019s not home,\u201d says Danielle. They found one of the best ways to do that is to plan ahead. \u201cAll throughout, we need to have one parent who has flexibility that allows them to work around the other. And that\u2019s changed at times. But because I\u2019m a planner, everything is organised,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo, at the beginning of the year, for example, I\u2019ll sit down with Frank and I\u2019ll say, \u2018Well, this year Bella has this after school, and I need to do that. How many days a week do you think you could pick her up from school?\u2019 And we plan it. And it stays that way for the whole year.\u201d Although they are both playful, they\u2019re thoughtful about how they talk to each other. \u201cEarly on, I said to Frank: \u2018Australians have that self-deprecating sort of humour. And then once you\u2019re in a couple, your self-deprecation falls over on to the other person as well. And I just don\u2019t think it needs to. I think we\u2019re unkind a little bit too easily.\u2019\u201d They continue to be \u201cintellectually adventurous\u201d, encouraging each other along the way: \u201cWe both stretch each other in different ways,\u201d says Danielle. Frank agrees: \u201cWe\u2019ve both made each other much better ... If I hadn\u2019t met Danielle, I can\u2019t imagine having lived overseas and done the work I\u2019ve done overseas.\u201d For Danielle, their secret to staying together is simple: trust. She remembers a day in Paris, not long after they\u2019d arrived, when a man ambushed them on the street. \u201cHe went to grab me and Frank pushed him off. And then he went to grab Frank, and I ran back into it and pushed him off Frank. And none of it was thought about in the moment. But we both showed exactly the same protection for each other \u2026 we would probably give our lives for each other.\u201d At the core is a solid commitment to each other. Years ago, Frank made Danielle a promise she never thought he could keep. \u201c[He] said that he was going to make sure that every year of my life would be better than the year before. And I said to him, \u2018You are making stuff up. You cannot say that. There\u2019s no one in the world who could ever say that.\u2019 And the bizarrest thing is, every year has been better than the year before,\u201d she says, through a few happy tears. \u201cWe\u2019ve just been so lucky.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science, right?\u201d jokes Frank. \u201cYou work out what you want and I let it happen. That way, you get what you want every year.\u201d Danielle laughs: \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a little bit of that too.\u201d We want to hear your stories about staying together.
