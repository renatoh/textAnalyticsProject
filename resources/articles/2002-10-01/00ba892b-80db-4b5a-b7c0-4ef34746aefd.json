Inter are on the run in first, the Flying Donkeys of Chievo are airborne again, and there's life in Tuscan football yet. Could it be any more exciting? Let's start from the top: Inter's 2 - 0 win over Bologna on Sunday has seen the nerazzurri open up a handy three-point lead in first, re-establishing their manager Hector Cuper's role as the jammiest man in Serie A. Having survived both the disastrous season finale last May and Ronaldo's \"either he goes or I will\" ultimatum a month later, \"mini\" Cuper still shows no signs of creating anything remotely watchable from his remaining troop. No matter: Francesco Toldo at the back continues the clubs' long line of game-saving goalies, and with Crespo and Vieri up front someone's always bound to knock a goal in sometime. That said, Inter's real MVP this Sunday turned out to be the referee, allowing a controversial goal and ignoring a penalty for the understaffed but ever-plucky Bologna. Meanwhile, Inter's city rivals Milan surprisingly dropped to second after being beaten 3 - 2 on Saturday night by Chievo Verona. Little Chievo were everyone's favourite story last season, when armed with a budget of buttons they blazed their way to the top of the table and grabbed a Uefa Cup place during their first-ever visit to Serie A. Last summer though didn't go as smoothly. Lazio's insolvency put two big transfers on hold, while star wingman Eriberto went out in a false passport scandal. This season started with the Flying Donkeys underprepared and unable to reproduce their pacy style of yore... until last weekend, that is. Saturday saw them get their Asses back in gear, putting three goals past a Milan team that had, stats fans, only conceded one in their last five games put together. Crikey. Still, Saturday's result does little to change the clearest thing to emerge so far: Milan are the team to beat. Since September, the President's men have surprised everyone with their spectacular style and unorthodox line-up, overloaded with strikers and goal-scoring midfielders. And this in Italy, too. Milan score more goals per game than anyone else in Europe, they're top-ranked in the Champions League and they're still just three points back at home, one point clear of the lumbering Juventus. The only minor headache is the wayward form of central defender Alessandro \"Feather my\" Nesta - caught dreaming again for Chievo's opener last Saturday. Having moved north on the final day of the transfer market, the former Lazio captain's form for both club and country has since crumbled. For the defender once dubbed \"the new Baresi\" and the man at the centre of Italy's post-Maldini hopes, these are worrying times. Milan blame the intense series of games he's faced since September, and insist he'll soon be back on top of his game. For the Italian press, meanwhile, he's simply \"unrecognisable\". Roma fans would argue that this is nothing new. As they recall all too happily, back in the Rome derby last March, Alessandro the Great failed to even show up for the second half after playing a decisive role in Lazio's four-goal first-half collapse. As it happens, the Rome derby was back at centre stage this Sunday night, rounding off the round six fixtures. After a drab first half, it proved this time a game with everything; a missed penalty, some scuffles and even a goal from Gabriel Batistuta. Both sides are still hovering on the fringes of the leading pack in Serie A, but it's Lazio who must be happiest, having sold off their two biggest players this summer and entrusting the rest to Roberto Mancini, a man fresh from er, Fiorentina. Few would have predicted two months back that they'd be fourth now, just two points behind Milan - and even more importantly, one above Roma. Let's conclude though with Empoli, the biggest surprises of all. Four years ago this Tuscan club were at the centre of the biggest rigging scandal since the Good Ship Venus, relegated to the Second Division on suspicion of trying to buy a referee. And last season, they were back in the news after their team doctor was caught rigging the post-match dope tests. Not the club's fault, ruled the Italian FA at the time, allowing them promotion back to the top division where - lo and behold - they're all the way up in seventh, tied with Roma. For a club based barely 30 miles from Florence, this success couldn't come at a sweeter time: neighbours Fiorentina now lie seventh too, but in the fourth, having dropped three divisions (and an \"n\" from their name) after last summer's bankruptcy. Whatever else this season holds, Fiorentia is one satisfaction Empoli fans will be able to rely on.
