So when did you realise the important fact about Nicola Walker\u2019s character, Stevie? OK, it\u2019s been done before in everything from Dead Man\u2019s Shoes to Edge of Darkness to Drop Dead Fred, but making one of this country\u2019s best television actors, essentially, an imaginary friend is an audacious move by Abi Morgan. I was both gutted and delighted when the big reveal happened. Yes, it did take me that long to figure it out. Not until I saw the gory mess that used to be the back of Stevie\u2019s head did I twig that River\u2019s watery eyes and dogged pursuit of that young drug dealer were all for her \u2013 his recently murdered partner. As soon as he spots the car you can see from Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s insanely expressive eyes this is more than just a pursuit of a murder suspect. The man in his sights is, he thinks, responsible for ripping out his soul. I also loved the completely unassuming set-up of their relationship in that visit to the drive-through burger bar. It gave no hint of the reveal to come and allowed us (perhaps rather cruelly) to invest in their relationship: the stern, undemonstrative Swede and his clever, funny sidekick. She annoys him but he loves her, loves to be annoyed by her. Even the singing in the car and the later throwback to it in the karaoke booth had me grinning from ear to ear. Another writer could have overdone it, made it syrupy, but I think Morgan judges their friendship beautifully. She must have done, because I wanted to yell when she killed Stevie off. The shot of the Thames at night and the River logo over the top gives no hint of the emotional wrench that is to come. I like the way it\u2019s branded like a traditional cop show but then pulls the rug out from under you quite suddenly. Once we know that Stevie is dead (but not a ghost, River is clear about that) River\u2019s internal world is unleashed on to the screen. His other imaginary friends, temporary residents in that rather crowded mind palace, start to pop up. When this week\u2019s murder victim (who turned out not to have been murdered) sits at his dining table, telling him she needs to pack for university, I assumed it was his daughter. And I like that it wasn\u2019t all explained with exposition-heavy dialogue. It\u2019s nice to be left to work things out for yourself for once. Then we meet the ghastly Thomas Neill Cream, the infamous Lambeth Poisoner, played with relish by Eddie Marsan. River\u2019s been reading about him and his rather unpleasant ideas, but I\u2019m assuming that this is the last we\u2019ll see of him after River decided to silence his angry ranting once and for all. Back on the balcony, River\u2019s superior, played by Lesley Manville, tells him to get counselling, and we find out that Stevie\u2019s murder happened only three weeks ago. For a dour, Scandi-inspired detective drama, the world is actually quite colourful \u2013 and all the more believable for it. The ghost of Stevie isn\u2019t pale or other-worldly: she sits in his passenger seat sucking milkshake through a straw, ruminating on the current case as though she is still alive. At the centre of it all is Skarsg\u00e5rd in the form of his life, internalising nearly everything and leaking just enough inner turmoil to utterly convince. As if all of this wasn\u2019t enough to take in, unassuming acting powerhouse Adeel Akhtar (you might remember him as the conspiracist Wilson Wilson from Utopia) arrives as River\u2019s new partner Ira King. He\u2019s a half-Jewish, half-Muslim detective constable with a nice line in hangdog expressions and dry one-liners. The only clanging howler is River and Ira\u2019s visit to the young murder suspect in prison. They interview him without his lawyer present, which no police officer would ever do, not even a maverick one. This is the only time Morgan falls down, I think. If the facts don\u2019t fit a scene, she just gently pushes them aside to focus on the drama. Despite River\u2019s protestations to the counselor, we know he loved Stevie, although what kind of love it was is unclear. At this early stage, I see them as father and daughter or the Doctor and his companion. He\u2019s protective, but she\u2019s easily as capable and clever as him. When he wakes up on Stevie\u2019s bed after going round to feed her cat, we know he is grieving as though he\u2019s lost his touchstone in life. For all of the imaginary figures we see with him, he is mostly alone and considered a weirdo by most colleagues. That shot of River, perched high in the tree with the \u201cghost\u201d of the dead girl sitting next to him is sublime. Her boyfriend is moved to a holding cell while she reads from Romeo and Juliet; Juliet\u2019s dying speech, and River realises he is going to make a second attempt at suicide. When he howled: \u201cYou have to live,\u201d at the boy, cutting him down from the ceiling, I had something in my eye. And, instead of ending the episode on his despair, this show does something unexpected. It returns you to the warm embrace of his relationship with Stevie. That karaoke scene could have been catastrophically schmaltzy, but it is joyful. To the sounds of I Love to Love, he sings alone in the booth and we see him pin Stevie\u2019s milkshake cup to his wall. And just when you think it\u2019s over, we cut to the dead suspect, sitting on the end of his bed, taunting him that he didn\u2019t commit the murder. I am fully and completely hooked. Abi Morgan has my emotions in a blender, her finger hovering over the button. This is one heck of a way to jumpstart the cop show genre back into life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
