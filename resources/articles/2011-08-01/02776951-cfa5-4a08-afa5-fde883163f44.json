There are 20 sports on the London 2012 Paralympic programme, 17 of which are the Paralympic versions of the 26 sports played in the Olympic Games. Boccia, goalball and wheelchair rugby are the only Paralympic-specific sports. Boccia is best described as a wheelchair version of boules, while goalball is for unsighted athletes and resembles handball. What are the classifications? The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has established six disability categories: amputee, cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, wheelchair, visually impaired and les autres, a catch-all category for athletes whose disability does not fall strictly within the boundaries of one of the other five. The intellectual disability class has been absent from the past two Paralympics after 10 members of the Spanish basketball team were shown to have competed despite having no disability, but it returns in London. How are classifications decided? Visually impaired athletes and those with an intellectual disability are still classified on a strictly medical basis, but since the 1980s all other athletes have been subject to what is known as functional classification rather than a medical one \u2013 in other words, athletes are grouped to compete together based on the overall loss of function that their disability has caused them, rather than on their particular medical disability. Do the same rules apply to all sports? The specific classifications vary among the different sports but, broadly speaking, competitors are split into a number of different classes depending on the extent to which their disability affects their ability to play the sport. What is Great Britain's record like? Britain has great Paralympic pedigree. Most people are familiar with Tanni Grey-Thompson but there has been plenty of other medal success over the years: Britain, with 493, has won more gold medals than any country apart from the US (666) and has finished second in the medal table in each of the past three Games, behind China in 2004 and 2008 and Australia in 2000. What are GB's best events? If the 2008 Games are anything to go by, Britain should be strong in cycling and swimming, with the 17 and 11 golds respectively in those disciplines making up two-thirds of Britain's gold medals. David Weir and Ben Rushgrove have strong hopes in athletics; Darren Kenny and Sarah Storey will be strong cycling contenders. Lee Pearson has won nine out of nine equestrian events at the past three Paralympics, a remarkable 100% gold medal record. Who are the ones to watch? There are many Britons with aspirations of several gold medals, but among the best known is the swimmer Ellie Simmonds. Aged 13 at the time, she won two golds in the pool in Beijing and went on to become the youngest person awarded an MBE. She was the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year in 2008, the first disabled sportsperson to win the award. Since then she has established herself as probably the most recognisable British Paralympian, featuring in an advertising campaign for a breakfast cereal and appearing on All Star Family Fortunes. Tom Aggar, who was in the Saracens academy programme before sustaining a spinal injury whilst out with friends, has dominated Paralympic rowing since becoming world champion in 2007, just two years after his injury. He added gold in Beijing and has retained his world title twice, posting a world-record time in the 2009 final. How many athletes will take part? London will welcome a total of 4,233 competitors to the Games in 2012, 1,100 of whom will contest the athletics competitions. Team GB sent 212 athletes to Beijing and will have around 300 at their home games next year. How many golds are on offer? There are 499 golds up for grabs. The ParalympicsGB performance director, Penny Briscoe, says her target is to win more medals and to repeat 2008's second-placed finish: \"The results this cycle have been stunningly exceptional. We've stepped on in terms of how we prepare our athletes and that is the case across all sports.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
