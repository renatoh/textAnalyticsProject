Their careers became linked through their experiments with recording sound and later through the appearance of phones in films. The sophisticated Italian comedies of the 1930s came to be known as 'white telephone movies', and there are as many telephones as blondes in the films of Alfred Hitchcock, who began his working life as an employee of the Henley Telegraph Company. Hitchcock's signature appearance in his first American film, Rebecca, has him standing outside a telephone kiosk occupied by George Sanders; during Grant's famous long kiss with Ingrid Bergman in Notorious he's conducting a phone call with his boss; the blonde Tippi Hedren is trapped inside a glass kiosk by menacing seagulls in The Birds; Dial M For Murder speaks, or rings, for itself. The phone call (remote, but intimate) and the phone booth (private, but public) symbolise aspects of modern life and our relationship to technology, and they're cleverly used in Joel Schumacher's involving thriller Phone Booth. Interestingly, though I'm sure coincidentally, the plot is very similar to a 1936 radio play that Patrick Hamilton wrote for the BBC, Money with Menaces, in which an apparently innocent middle-class man is led a merry dance around London from phone box to phone box, menaced by an unseen tormentor who turns out to be someone the protagonist bullied at school. When Hitch suggested that he and Hamilton work together, the writer offered to adapt this radio piece. The Master turned it down and they didn't collaborate until Rope a decade later. A pity. Scripted by the gifted writer-director Larry Cohen (whose credits include a movie I haven't seen called The Man Who Loved Hitchcock), the Schumacher film stars Colin Farrell as Stu Shepard, an unscrupulous Manhattan PR man very like the slimy Sidney Falco, unforgettably played by Tony Curtis in Sweet Smell of Success. Like Falco, Stu is first seen bobbing and weaving through Times Square, fast-talking, glad-handing, making deals on his mobile phone. When he gets to a phone booth on 53rd Street between 8th Avenue and Broadway, he stops to make a call to an ingenuous actress client, whom he's enticing into an affair. Promising to get her name into the gossip columns, he says: 'The first step on the way to being noticed is to be mentioned.' While he's in the booth, a pizza is mysteriously delivered to him. He rudely rejects it, insulting the delivery boy. Then the phone rings, and a quiet, sardonic voice starts to needle him. 'What do you want?' - 'I want your complete attention.' And this unseen caller gets it, for the next 70 minutes, because he knows everything about Stu and because, from a nearby window, he has a rifle with a telescopic lens trained on the box. The makers find it necessary to explain why this kiosk - which belongs to the company Alexander Graham Bell created - is being used by Stu. Why isn't he, like everyone else, using a mobile? The answer is that this is one of the last phone booths left in this area of New York and the two-timing PR man doesn't want his wife to see a phone bill listing calls to his lovers. For over an hour Stu is trapped in the box getting more and more desperate as his level-voiced torturer keeps up the pressure. A trio of hookers try to break in to use the phone, and the plug-ugly doorman from 'Sextuff', the parlour in which they work, comes over with a baseball bat. This pimp figure is killed by the sniper and the police, the media and Stu's wife arrive on what is now a crime scene. The tension mounts as Stu is forced by the unseen menace to get under the skin of the sympathetic black police captain (Forest Whitaker) in charge of the operation. Schumacher, cameraman Matthew Libatique and editor Mark Stevens keep the film as tautly wound as a tourniquet. They focus on Stu, but use a split screen and superimposed images to show other people in the street or at the end of the line (though never the sniper). At times, however, it can seem a little fussy. What gives the film a special interest is the way the phone kiosk becomes a cross between a glass coffin and a confessional. As in Hamilton's radio play, the psychotic manipulator is a moral avenger. He's an angel of death and a self-appointed judge who (not for the first time, he claims) has set out to expose a carefully selected victim's crimes and depredations - making him face up to them himself and to confess them to the world. By the end the deplorable PR man has undergone a nightmarish inquisition and become worthy of our sympathy. For which one of us would wish to undergo the public exposure to which he is treated?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
