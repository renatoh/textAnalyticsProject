But are they big enough to hang on to Curbishley if Leeds come calling? Leeds will appear even more foolish if they do not at least test his affection for the London club when starting their search for a full-time replacement for Terry Venables. Curbishley's latest comments about Charlton's ability to compete on level terms with the elite of the Premiership did nothing to allay concerns over their ability to satisfy his personal ambitions. It is time for Charlton to worry when Curbishley hints he is envious of Middlesbrough. \"Middlesbrough have a fantastic chairman who has enabled them to try and fulfil their potential,\" he said, \"and you have to expect him to do it again in the summer. \"It is a bit more difficult for clubs like us to get into the top six or seven; some teams have spent \u00a3100m trying to do it. Our aim is normally to stay out of the bottom six.\" Charlton are now seventh in the Premiership and better placed than Middlesbrough to squeeze into the Uefa Cup by the end of the season. But there is much confidence from Malcolm Christie, Boro's new striker from Derby an goalscorer on Saturday. Christie said: \"If we can keep our run of results going, then anything is possible at this stage of the season. It's quite tight and I don't see why we can't be challenging for a European place. \"This team could really go places when the manager brings in a few more players this summer. Anything is possible next season.\" Christie's 57th-minute goal was a good example of his nimble finishing as he drifted in front of Charlton's defenders and turned in Franck Queudrue's low cross at the near post. Excellent saves by the Charlton keeper Dean Kiely on either side of the goal denied Middlesbrough a victory that would have been harsh on Charlton. Jonatan Johansson's 26th-minute goal was Charlton's only reward after Kevin Lisbie, Johansson and Jason Euell missed excellent opportunities. \"You pay for it sometimes when you don't take your chances,\" said Curbishley.
