Why is Toots &amp; the Maytals always blasting from the common rooms of Eton, and why, if you go to a Burning Spear concert, are you as likely to be standing next to an Old Wykehamist as a Rastafarian? Chris Blackwell - white Jamaican, Harrovian, founder of Island Records - that's why, I reckon. Skin up a big fat one, man, OK yah, Rastafari! Blackwell is also responsible for some of the best records of the past half century, and for probably the greatest ever independent label - a label that allowed musicians to get on with it and make the music they wanted to do. What an extraordinarily wide spectrum of artists there were on Island - from Free to Sly &amp; Robbie. I can live without all that ostentatious prog rock nonsense: Jethro Tull and King Crimson. But then that is more than made up for by Nick Drake (another public schoolboys' favourite), Cat Stevens, Grace Jones, U2, Frankie Goes to Hollywood. And the reggae, of course, yah? Toots and Jimmy Cliff, Third World, Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers. I know Bob has been ruined by being blared from a billion beach bars the world over, but it's still hard to hear the opening bars of Concrete Jungle without getting a little shiver down the spine. Now spark up a big cone, dude, and get back to the Latin prep. Bob's not around to talk, of course; he's gone to the concrete jungle in the sky. Nor is Nick Drake. But just about everyone else is - Rita, Sly &amp; Robbie, Grace, Bono, Cat (or Yusuf as he now is, fishing by the canal in London). And Blackwell himself. This exemplary film is built around an interview with him, punctuated by music clips and chat from the people whose careers he made. Blackwell is an extraordinarily wide spectrum himself: a little bit Jamaican, a lot posh; relaxed and charming, but also driven. And a proper visionary. I once went to Jamaica and every single person I met, without exception, claimed to be his best mate. I'm not surprised, I think I'd quite like to be Chris Blackwell's best mate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
