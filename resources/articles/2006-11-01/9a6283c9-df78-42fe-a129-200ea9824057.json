Obviously, being Welsh, I've played rugby, and I boxed as an amateur, which led to me becoming chief inspector with the British Boxing Board of Control, Welsh area. I'm also a Territorial Army physical training instructor. At Barry College, I teach on the BTec first diploma in sport and the BTec sport science, and I'm responsible for teaching first aid. We've just started teaching automated external defibrillation - the government is planning to put defibrillators in lots of public places, so we're giving people the necessary knowledge to pick one up and use it. Some of the youngsters here don't want to be taught and the challenge is to try to enthuse them. Without wanting to sound corny, if I can make a difference to someone who has left school without any qualifications, I feel great. One of the other big problems is that everything is accountable: with budgets, staffing is where most of the money goes, so obviously we have to multitask. You come in at 8am, finish about 5pm-6pm, and you wonder where the day's gone - lunch break has been spent handling bits of paper. We get a tremendous amount of paperwork and we put in a lot of work outside our normal hours. They say it's reflected in your rate of pay - in that case, I'm on a minimum wage! I've worked as a steelworker, as a regular soldier within the Territorial Army, and in various other jobs, and I can honestly say I've never worked as hard in all my life as I do now. But it is enjoyable. I think teaching is still vocational because if you want to make a difference, you have to be prepared to take the work on. And if you can make a difference to three or four youngsters - that's the critical point. \u00b7 Kevin Fulthorpe is a sport and exercise lecturer at Barry College, Vale of Glamorgan"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
