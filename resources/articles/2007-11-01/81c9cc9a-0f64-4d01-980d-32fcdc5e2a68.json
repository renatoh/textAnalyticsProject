Charities are failing to \"adequately record and monitor\" the impact of donations worth almost \u00a39bn a year as well as \u00a31.3bn in annual subsidies on tax-efficient giving, according to Martin Brookes, director of research at New Philanthropy Capital, which advises wealthy donors on which causes to support. \"No one sits in judgment over the value for money provided by this,\" Brookes said in a speech to the Royal Society of Arts. \"This lack of scrutiny is bad. It results in worse performance of charities and that's not fair to the taxpayer or charity donor.\" In a move that caused consternation among charity leaders, NPC called for the government to set up a powerful charity inspectorate to tackle the problem. Running in parallel with the Charity Commission, the body would produce performance data to allow the construction of league tables, for the first time ranking charities by the value for money they deliver from donations. It would fulfil a similar role to Ofsted which assesses schools, the Healthcare Commission which scrutinises hospitals and the National Audit Office which vets government spending. Brookes said that for too long charities have traded on public belief that they are \"intrinsically good\". Informed donors would be \"more likely to pick better charities\", he went on. \"The average pound donated would then have more impact. Relatively weak charities would lose funding and that would be right.\" NPC has lodged its proposal with senior Cabinet Office officials. The NPC's trustees include Gavyn Davies, the economist and confidant of Gordon Brown. But charity bosses attacked the proposal last night. \"This would severely damage civil society in this country,\" said Stuart Etherington, chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, which represents 5,500 British charities. \"Charities are not a functionary of the state and this would place government scrutiny over a layer of society which has nothing to do with government. We are already inspected within an inch of our lives and we will fight this all the way.\" In July, the NSPCC faced claims from NPC that there was zero evidence its Full Stop campaign against child abuse leads to fewer beatings. Despite this, the campaign raised \u00a3250m and was the biggest charitable fundraising campaign in aid of a social cause in British history, with more than 2 million people buying the green Full Stop badges. Camilla Batmanghelidjh, founder of Kids Company - a small London charity which provides \"practical, emotional and educational support\" to 11,000 vulnerable inner city children - said selecting charities as if picking stocks means charities which aim for emotional or psychological outcomes will lose out. \"By creating league-table type evaluation systems which are not sophisticated enough to measure emotional gains we are doing the charitable sector a great disservice.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
