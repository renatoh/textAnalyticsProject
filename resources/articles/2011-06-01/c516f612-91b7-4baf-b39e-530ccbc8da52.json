Jonathan Pearce, in his Capital Radio days, showed promise but the BBC knocked the rough edges off \u2013 possibly by threatening him with another series of Robot Wars \u2013 and Jon Champion has his moments on ESPN, but neither of them, nor even Eddie and Stevo on Sky's Super League coverage, have managed to rival the Duffster's stream of consciousness routine, where he ditches commentary on the actual race in favour of rambling anecdotes, mostly about meals eaten in nearby restaurants. Finally, though, a genuine contender for the Duffster's crown has emerged, and once more from Eurosport. I do not know what they are putting in the water there at Rue Gaston et Ren\u00e9 Caudron Issy-les-Moulineaux, but the tennis commentator Chris Bradnam has clearly been drinking deeply of it. Last week, you may recall (if you are among the many thousands collecting these columns in the special souvenir Screen Break binder), our hero shared some quite personal information as he warned of the dangers of a gluten\u2011free diet \u2013 for the benefit, no doubt, of all those people who tune into Eurosport for the dietary advice. Now Bradnam has been addressing the question exercising the still-just-about-United Kingdom \u2013 what will it take for Andy Murray to win a major? \u2013 with a bizarre and impenetrable hypothesis that made my brain ache on a sunny Friday afternoon. It stretched over two disappointing games for Murray at the start of the third set of his semi-final defeat against Rafael Nadal, as Murray looked dolefully up at his support team, muttering imprecations in that way he has. \"It's an interesting dinner-party question,\" began Bradnam, \"You win the lottery, and you're the only one who knows you've got the winning ticket, you bought it when you were filling your car up. You check your numbers, again when you're on your own, and it's up there, \u00a320m, so at that moment you are the only one that knows in your life, because you happen to check it, and you're on your own.\" Yes, we get the picture, Chris. Those dinner parties must just fly by round the Bradnam place. \"Who would you tell that you had won the lottery and how much would you tell them that you'd won?\" Chris continued. \"And I'll qualify in a minute about why I'm bringing that up. It's about the box, his team.\" Some tennis inconveniently interrupted here, in the style possibly of Chris's life partner handing round the After Eights, but our monologist was not about to be thrown off his stride: \"I hear he's not a great listener, but the sarcasm we believe it is when he's talking to his box like that, how are they feeling right now? At the end of the match, how does the conversation go with them and Andy? Have they won the lottery, and they certainly haven't told Andy how much they've won? Would it change the dialogue? I don't know. I mean what's it going to take for Andy to win a major, I guess, is what, in a very long, roundabout kind of way, I'm trying to say?\" I have tried the lottery analogy out on my three most intelligent friends, and none has yet managed to translate. Something to do with trust, we reckon. The point Chris misses, however, is that if you are a top tennis professional you have already more or less won the lottery, and are probably one of the few people in the world who could absorb \u00a320m without anyone noticing the slightest change in lifestyle. You would not need to tell anyone. Co-commentator Mats Wilander seemed as puzzled as the rest of us by Chris's dinner party banter, and contented himself with saying that Murray's team probably know \"he's a bit nuts\". Incidentally, one of you was good enough to point out last week that my little joke about Game, Set, and Mats, Eurosport's analysis show, was getting a second airing, having first appeared in 2008 (keep updating those binders, folks), on which topic you have to question whether Eurosport is making the most of the Mats brand? I notice, for instance, it is one of the few channels without a cookery show \u2013 and boy could we do with another of those \u2013 so how about Table Mats? Or a Songs of Praise rip-off, Mats in the Belfry? Cats, Hats, and Mats, meanwhile, is an exciting new format; the winner of seven grand slam tennis titles looks at the latest in headgear, while stroking a series of cute kittens. Do join in at home. It is a fun game, guaranteed to liven up the dullest dinner party."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
