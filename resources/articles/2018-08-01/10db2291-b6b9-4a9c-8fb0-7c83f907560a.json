We tried to send a lot of messages about strength and tactics this week because we are not in the best condition. Players are complaining about muscular problems \u2013 that\u2019s why Claudio [Bravo] is out and Kevin [De Bruyne] before. Fernandinho had big problems after the last game. Hopefully after the international break we\u2019ll be better.\u201d With De Bruyne out for three months with a knee injury Guardiola lost his No 2 goalkeeper for a similar period when Bravo ruptured an achilles tendon in training, forcing the club to recall the 19-year-old Aro Muric from loan at NAC Breda. Guardiola confirmed he would have brought in a new goalkeeper had the rules allowed it but fell foul of Bravo becoming injured after the close of the transfer window. \u201cRules are rules, so we accepted we would be unable to sign a new goalkeeper,\u201d he said. \u201cBut perhaps the association should think about this situation. Goalkeeping is a specialist position \u2013 you don\u2019t normally carry too many spares.\u201d Guardiola suggested De Bruyne\u2019s injury was because of post-World Cup fatigue, though explained Bravo, who was not involved in Russia, just suffered a freak accident. \u201cWe were playing a practice match the day after the Huddersfield game,\u201d he said. \u201cClaudio did not have a shot to save in the first 15 or 20 minutes, then as he rolled the ball out from his area he felt his ankle snap. It\u2019s just bad luck, sometimes these things happen, but now we have our options in place I am happy enough.\u201d David Silva has admitted it may be difficult to replicate the almost perfect standards set last season. \u201cI think something like that might only happen once in a lifetime but we have to try,\u201d the midfielder said. \u201cTrying to win consecutive titles is our next challenge but the other teams have strengthened so it might be more difficult. Last season there were moments when we played the ideal game: lots of goals, high percentage of ball possession, few chances conceded. I think that is very unusual in football nowadays.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
