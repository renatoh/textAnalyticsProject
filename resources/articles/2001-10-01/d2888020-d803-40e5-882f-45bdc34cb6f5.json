The condition known as variant CJD was named in 1996 when linked to the animal epidemic first identified 10 years earlier; since 1996 vCJD has been given as the cause of more than 100 deaths in Britain, France and Ireland. George Venters, consultant for the Lanarkshire health board in Scotland, said he believed vCJD was probably not a new disease but merely one identified more often because of closer scrutiny of illnesses. The novelty of vCJD was \"open to question\", writes Dr Venters in the British Medical Journal; scientists and others had reached \"precipitate conclusions\" because of the general anxiety about the \"dreadful possibility\" BSE caused disease in humans. Measures aimed at limiting this perceived risk were costing billions of pounds, he noted. The CJD surveillance unit at Edinburgh, which identified the probable link with BSE, was both proponent and arbiter of this diagnosis. But the relatively few vCJD cases, given human exposure to so many potentially infected cattle, was evidence the connection should be challenged. The disease might be no more than a condition spotted by Creutzfeld himself in 1913. Dr Venters said the unit had at first linked vCJD mainly to young people. Now the age range was being extended: \"This means more cases are likely to be diagnosed, giving the appearance of an increase in frequency that is spurious.\" James Ironside, from the unit and on the government committee on vCJD, rejected Dr Venters's view: new diseases in cattle, other animals, and in humans within the known time frame could not be coincidence; the disease signature in cow and human brains was similar; and checks had failed to identify \"missed\" cases of similar human diseases before the 1990s. However, said Professor Ironside: \"It is an interesting article. Complacency is not a good thing.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
