But West Ham's reborn back four have ruined all that, the 53 goals they have conceded this season all coming before their last three stingy clean sheets. The crucial factor in a four-match run that has yielded 10 points is that they now have two proper full-backs in Glen Johnson and Rufus Brevett; Nigel Winterburn creaks there no more. But the biggest transformation in recent weeks has been in the central defender Tomas Repka, whose poor discipline, both defensively and temperamentally, had become the focal point of the crowd's displeasure. Afterwards his manager Glenn Roeder acknowledged as much. \"The full-backs have taken a lot of pressure off the centre-backs. But the point of change for Tomas was when he was sent off here against Fulham [on Boxing Day] in a manner he knows was not acceptable. \"Since then he has not been booked, he hasn't questioned a decision and his performances have shot up. The key is he's not disputing anything. He's just concentrating on his own game. \"The fact is that referees never change their minds. The penny has dropped with Tomas. Some people go through life without ever learning. Tomas is also speaking better English and you can talk to him. And now he's looking happy and content with his game.\" It is not just in defence that West Ham have been revitalised. The signing of Les Ferdinand, too, has added a dimension to their armoury. The purchase of the 36-year-old was frowned upon by many and there are times when he resembles an old heavyweight boxer who has forgotten to retire, lost his footwork but hangs on to the puncher's chance. Ferdinand, though, has always been one of the game's outstanding headers of the ball and he is still strong in that department, his muscularity complementing the frail pace of Jermain Defoe. It was Ferdinand's flick which set up the first goal for Defoe in the 24th minute, two minutes after Tore Andre Flo - a shadow of his old, skilful self - had been profligate at the other end. And, when Ferdinand came off at half-time, Roeder was able to bring on Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9, whose No14 shirt is not the only thing he has in common with Arsenal's Thierry Henry. Kanout\u00e9's pace sent him clear for the second goal from Michael Carrick's through-ball midway through the second half and West Ham were out of the bottom three for the first time since November. The fact that this performance was achieved without the help of Lee Bowyer or Paolo Di Canio (and with only part-time assistance from Kanout\u00e9) explains why confidence is flowing so freely back to Upton Park. Sunderland, with only 19 points, are in the bottom three for keeps. The only challenge left to them is to beat Watford's all-time low points total of 24. Their manager Mick McCarthy, though publicly refusing to concede that relegation is inevitable, is already planning for next season's promotion battle. \"The team, quite clearly, needs changing,\" he said. \"We're the worst team in the league. That's as plain as the nose on my face and the nose on my face is very plain. \"We want fresh players, people who want fresh challenges, who see the club and the training ground and feel inspired, who want to try to get the club back in the Premiership - if the worst happens - which is where we belong.\" Man of the match : Joe Cole (West Ham)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
