The move followed a vote in the Turkish parliament backing deployment and further deadly attacks in Tripoli by an airforce under the control of Marshal Khalifa Haftar, the warlord who has been trying to oust the government since April. Erdogan told CNN Turk on Sunday that Turkish forces were already on their way to Libya. \u201cOur soldiers\u2019 duty there is coordination. They will develop the operation centre there. Our soldiers are gradually going right now,\u201d he said. The Turkish deployment, likely to take many weeks, risks a military confrontation between Turkey and other regional actors supporting Haftar, notably the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. Russian mercenaries, believed to have the backing of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, are also operating in Libya in support of Haftar. Putin has urged Erdo\u011fan not to send troops. Erdo\u011fan has been signalling his support for the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) ever since he signed a memorandum of understanding with Libya\u2019s prime minister, Fayez al-Serraj, in which the two sides agreed to carve out drilling rights in the Mediterranean and to cooperate militarily. European powers for years have failed to mediate an end to the conflict in Libya between the east and the west of the country, leaving a vacuum that Turkey is eager to fill. The latest European effort is to be a conference in Berlin, but its date has been repeatedly postponed as regional powers dispute the conference\u2019s purpose and attendance list. Attention to the rise in violence in Libya has been reduced due to the focus on north-east Syria and the US conflict with Iran. The speed of Turkish actions has been prompted by signs that Haftar\u2019s Libyan National Army (LNA) is stepping up its attacks on Tripoli, including a deadly air raid on the Hadaba military academy at the weekend that left 30 dead and 33 injured. The GNA called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to denounce the strikes, describing them as a war crime. But Turkey already has forces engaged in northern Syria, and the Turkish political opposition has opposed the deployment to Libya, fearing that the Erdo\u011fan government is overstretching itself militarily. The US embassy in Libya at the weekend called for an end to \u201cthe toxic foreign interference in Libya\u201d, citing \u201cthe arrival of Syrian fighters supported by Turkey as well as the deployment of Russian mercenaries\u201d. The embassy added: \u201cAll Libyan parties have a responsibility to end this dangerous involvement of foreign forces, which is contributing to civilian casualties and damaging civilian infrastructure to the detriment of all Libyans.\u201d The statement made no mention of the role of the United Arab Emirates, which has been supplying air support to the LNA for months, if not years. The UAE believes that Islamist militia, regarded as terrorists by the UAE, form the backbone of the GNA\u2019s military support. The Tripoli government, furious at the lack of European support, insists that it is a democratic force fighting Haftar, who is a proven war criminal and authoritarian."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
