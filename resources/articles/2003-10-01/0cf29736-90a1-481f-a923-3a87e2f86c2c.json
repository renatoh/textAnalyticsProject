The channel can show full delayed coverage or highlights at any time after the final whistle in Istanbul. The match will kick off at 6pm BST. The Football Association declined its share of the tickets for the October 11 match in Istanbul after 95 arrests were made before, during and after England's 2-0 win over Turkey in Sunderland in April. The minister for sport, Richard Caborn, recently requested that BSkyB, which paid \u00a33m for exclusive rights to the match, cede delayed coverage to a terrestrial channel. Caborn believed that might help persuade fans tempted to travel to stay home, thus reducing the potential for crowd trouble. Last night Caborn, welcoming the deal, said: \"This is such an important game for England and I am delighted that the widest possible audience will be able to see it on the day it happens.\" ITV must now decide whether the reorganisation of its Saturday night scheduling will favour showing the match in full or as highlights. Whichever it chooses, the channel is expected to use the match to promote to football fans its coverage of the rugby union World Cup and the following day's Japanese grand prix at Suzuka where the world champion Michael Schumacher is set to win a record sixth world title. The Turkish federation has urged its own fans to behave \"like gentlemen\" during the match in Istanbul's Sukru Saracoglu stadium. A statement said: \"While our players are making history on the pitch we fully believe our fans in the stands should support them continuously and act like gentlemen. \"Our only wish is that Turkish soccer, along with the fans and media, end this game with honour and that we witness another night of victory.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
