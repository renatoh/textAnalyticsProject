In a statement this afternoon, the chief whip, David Maclean, took issue with the suggestion that some whips had started to urge MPs to write to the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee to call for a confidence vote. Mr Maclean's statement said: \"As Conservative whips, appointed by Iain Duncan Smith, we remain totally loyal to the leadership of the Conservative party. \"We refute entirely suggestions in some of the press that Iain has lost the confidence of the whips office or that whips are encouraging a vote of no confidence or even encouraging colleagues to write to Sir Michael Spicer (chairman of the 1922 committee).\" In a reference to another report, in London's Evening Standard, the statement continued: \"The reported suggestion that Iain told the chief whip and deputy chief whip (Patrick McLoughlin) to 'get lost' is completely untrue as is the other ludicrous suggestion that there was then a 'revolt by the junior whips'. \"The report that whips have decided to take matters into their own hands is nonsense. Attempts to misrepresent the position of the whips office to destabilise the leadership are dishonourable and will be recognised as such by the vast majority of colleagues. \"I have today spoken personally to all the whips and they are unanimous in their support for the leader of the party.\" In a letter to the Guardian, Mr Maclean wrote: \"I wish to make it clear that the suggestion on the front page of today's Guardian that 'there is an operation going on in the whips office' to provoke a leadership election is outrageous and wrong. \"I know there is a lot of misinformation in the press just now about leadership election speculation but I am surprised the Guardian should fall for a piece of hype that is patently absurd.\" Mr Maclean's statement follows the former chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, dismissal this morning of a report that he would challenge Iain Duncan Smith for the Conservative leadership as \"complete nonsense\". A front page report in today's Times claimed that Mr Clarke - who has twice before tried and failed for the Tory crown - was to throw his hat in the ring. But the backbench MP for Rushcliffe today knocked the story down flat, saying: \"It's complete nonsense. I haven't told anybody that I'm going to stand in the Conservative leadership election. \"I've been taking no part at all in all this controversy over Iain Duncan Smith and I don't intend to do so.\" If correct, that will prove something of an embarrassment for the Times, which has stuck its neck out on this story, claiming both that Mr Clarke was \"the bruiser most feared by Labour\" and, more tendentiously, that \"his opposition to the war in Iraq has increased his popularity with grassroots activists who are increasingly sceptical about military action.\" Such a claim is hard to measure, but - while the Tories are keen to exploit the forthcoming Hutton report for political capital - it was hard to detect much anti-war sentiment at their recent Blackpool conference. Mr Clarke's denial followed the announcement by a second Tory corporate donor that he would like to see a leadership challenge. Multi-millionaire businessman John Madejski last night said the Conservatives needed to resolve the current uncertainty over Mr Duncan Smith's position. The Reading FC chairman, who is ranked among Britain's 100 wealthiest people and has given more than \u00a380,000 to the Tories since 2001, told BBC2's Newsnight that a leadership election would \"clear the air\". \"I think there's so much going on now that to get the situation resolved one way or another there should be an election just to confirm either Iain Duncan Smith is going to carry on as leader of the Tory party or someone new will be coming along to take over,\" he said. \"As a would-be donor of the Tory party I think it's very important we have a democratic process in this country, and any government has a credible opposition.\" His comments came after Stuart Wheeler, who has given \u00a35m to the party, said there was an \"overwhelming\" case for a new leader and MPs had a \"duty\" to force a contest. But senior Conservative figures continued to rally round their leader. The shadow home secretary, Oliver Letwin, urged his party to \"calm down and move forward\", saying that would convince the donors to start giving again. \"They will change their minds about that if they see that the party is getting back together and we are getting back to the business of debating how we run our public services on a smaller tax burden - the real issue of the election,\" he said. Politics is all about \"ebb and flow\", Mr Letwin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"It is important that the Conservative party gets back to the issues and ends what I regard as the utterly absurd distraction of considering our navels and wondering whether we should have a different leader,\" he added. Tory donor Lord Hanson said: \"Many Tory MPs - and I know where they live - are more concerned with their own ambition than the party's welfare. \"I have been pleasantly surprised at the widespread strength of support for Duncan Smith who, don't forget, they elected, the constituencies elected. \" \"So they are the ones who will ultimately count.\" The peer told Today that the Tory leader was the \"alternative to razzle dazzle\". \"IDS believes in himself and his ideals. He doesn't believe that a cheesy grin gets the job done. Nor do I. That is why I support him,\" he said. \"He is a strong man. He has been elected because he appeals to those who trust him at the right time to run the country better than the present government. \"Yet what support does he get from some of his own MPs? Very little. Tory MPs thrive on suicidal disloyalty.\" Lord Hanson blamed \"a few dissatisfied MPs\" for Mr Duncan Smith's problems. \"I don't think these few dissidents can remove Iain. I think the party members want him and I think he will get over this. It will die. It is not something that is enormous,\" he added. The shadow work and pensions secretary, David Willetts, told Newsnight: \"I do want to clear the air, and the best way to clear the air is for people to recognise that Iain is the democratically elected leader of our party - in fact the first democratically elected leader of our party. \"That is why changing leader would be such a serious mistake.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
