For the last monthly press conference of the year Brown brought along Alistair Darling, the chancellor, to reassure the public they were tackling the fallout from the run on Northern Rock, and dealing with the errors that the Labour donor and data loss problems had thrown up. Economy Brown and Darling met Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, and Sir Callum McCarthy, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, yesterday. They denied a rift with King. Brown was due to speak to President Bush yesterday and has invited the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to London to discuss their joint proposals for greater financial stability. \"The fundamentals of the British economy are, and remain, sound ... we stand able to weather the global financial storms and to respond where necessary, as the Bank of England has already done, with a cut in interest rates,\" Brown said. \"The action we have taken this year on public sector pay in particular has brought inflation down.\" Brown and Darling defended their resistance to backdating the police's 2.5% pay rise, as an arbitration panel had recommended. \"No one would have wanted to have done more than us to give the police and other vital public services their full pay rises. But to have their pay rises wiped out by inflation and rising interest rates would be counterproductive,\" Darling said. Darling blamed Northern Rock for having \"no plan B\", and said the FSA should have put that question to the bank before it was too late. Charles Clarke Brown rejected the charge from Charles Clarke in yesterday's Guardian that he was guilty of \"disloyalty\" to Tony Blair and should show more faith in his senior ministers. He regularly appeared alongside ministers such as Darling, David Miliband, and Hilary Benn, he said. \"All the discussions we have in cabinet revolve around the important long-term challenges we face. And just as I worked with Tony Blair, I work with all my colleagues in the cabinet.\" Constitutional reform Brown gave a qualified endorsement of the Commons public administration committee's call for him to give up the power to appoint peers. \"I don't think the prime minister should have the final say,\" he said. While he and the other party leaders should be allowed to put forward recommendations for peerages, they needed to pass tests of probity and public interest. The final decision would be made by an appointments commission. Brown congratulated Nick Clegg, the new Liberal Democrat leader. \"We look forward to working together on the issues that unite our two parties and unite the country,\" he said - including constitutional reform. Party funding The revelation that David Cameron's constituency party had to return \u00a37,400 in illegal gifts showed the Tories had \"exactly the same\" problems as Labour, who had to give back more than \u00a3650,000 in secret donations from Tyneside businessman David Abrahams. He urged the Tories to rejoin cross-party talks on political funding. \"I am not going to cast aspersions about people's integrity and I think it would be better if politicians waited to get the full facts before they made allegations.\" Leadership Brown nearly called an election after high poll ratings for his personal competence in the face of the summer terror threat and foot and mouth outbreaks. Yesterday he drew problems where his handling has been less sure-footed, Northern Rock and party funding, into that same narrative. \"I think people know that when a problem arises we will deal with it, and we will deal with it even if that means taking difficult decisions,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
