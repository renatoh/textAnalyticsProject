This fifth-round tie was the first time Jos\u00e9 Mourinho fielded a quartet that could claim to be English football\u2019s fleetest. Factor in the rawness of Martial, Rashford and Lingard, plus Mkhitaryan\u2019s street-wise football brain, and this was a cocktail to quicken pulses by offering a glimpse of United\u2019s future. Lingard threw down a first marker by motoring along the right, leaving Craig Conway a spectator, and finding Mkhitarayan who in turn fed Rashford. He and Lingard were in the XI as Mourinho rested Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Juan Mata. This is the embarrassment of attacking riches Mourinho possesses \u2013 he could leave his leading scorer and a world and European champion on the bench and replace them with last season\u2019s FA Cup final matchwinner (Lingard) and the most exciting teenage English prospect in a generation (Rashford). Before the match Mourinho had said: \u201cThe opponent will fight hard and traditionally. It was never easy for Manchester United to play at Blackburn. We are not expecting an easy match.\u201d He was proved correct. Danny Graham opened the scoring after 17 minutes for the home side, posing the question of whether the speedy foursome could respond to the pressure and wrest the game back from Rovers. The answer arrived within 10 minutes with the kind of move Mourinho must have hoped for in making his selection. Sergio Romero rolled the ball out and it went to Mkhitaryan. The Armenian had begun to run the match and he moved forward before sending a delightful outside-of-the-right-boot pass into Rashford\u2019s path. The centre-forward did not have to break stride and the way he rounded Jason Steele and then buried the finish were impressive, too. United\u2019s travelling support had been in fine voice already. Now, they ratcheted up the volume with their rendition of I\u2019m into Something Good. Next came the old standby of We\u2019re on our way to Wembley as the prospect of the holders returning to the stadium came nearer. Rashford\u2019s goal was his first since early January when scoring two in the 4-0 third-round victory over Reading at Old Trafford. This was the last time the No19 started in his coveted No9 berth. In addition Mkhitaryan was operating in the No10 position for which he appears ideal, though his finishing can be lacking. He might have done better on one occasion when Martial found him as he arrived in the area. Yet with Mkhitaryan, Martial, Rashford and Lingard all zooming in and out of space and between the lines they bewitched Rovers. Mkhitaryan\u2019s miss was followed by a clumsy Martial pass when he should have released Lingard, who later misdirected a free header. All of this had Mourinho stamping his feet in frustration. Part of this show of emotion may have been fuelled by his desire to avoid a replay which would add yet another fixture to United\u2019s congested list and take the total of matches to a potential 67, if the finals of the Cup and the Europa League were reached. A lack of killer instinct has cost United this season in the league where seven draws have left them 12 points behind Chelsea. There has been an improvement recently, though. Their last five games have yielded 12 goals. Yet this is hardly the rampant United of yore and Mourinho showed his concern by replacing Lingard and Martial with Ibrahimovic and Paul Pogba. The reshuffle this caused had Rashford going left, Mkhitaryan right, as Pogba became the new playmaker and Ibrahimovic the lone striker. United\u2019s winner came with classic simplicity as Pogba lobbed the defence and Ibrahimovic finished deftly after a sweetly timed run for his 24th goal of the season. Ibrahimovic said: \u201cMe and Paul Pogba came on to boost us up a little bit and it worked, we are happy with the win and we are still in every cup. We keep going, we get more confidence and now we are in the decisive part of the season.\u201d A content Mourinho said: \u201cWhen I have really important players on the bench then I can try to make an impact. It depends on their mentality. I spoke to Paul and Zlatan at half-time and they were more than ready to come on with the right attitude for the team. I am happy with the victory. I think we deserved to win.\u201d On this showing Mkhitaryan, Lingard and Martial, in particular, can all learn from the ruthlessness shown by Ibrahimovic and Pogba. All three spurned chances. By the close only Mkhitaryan remained as Rashford was taken off for Mata two minutes from the end. As a foursome they were not perfect but they offer Mourinho a fine option, and as the games keep on coming they may yet get a few more chances to hone the act and show what United fans can expect in the coming years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
