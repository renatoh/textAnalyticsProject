The minister shot himself with a .38 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver shortly after returning to his office from a short trip home on Wednesday, Tishrin newspaper said, quoting a statement from the chief public attorney, Muhammad al-Louji. After an examination of the body, and interviews with witnesses, \"it was confirmed that ... Kanaan placed the tip of the revolver in his mouth and fired it\", the newspaper said. Office staff \"heard the muffled sound of a gunshot\" and a manager found the minister \"sprawled on his back behind his desk, his finger on the trigger of the revolver, a hand on his chest\". Gen Kanaan was still alive, breathing quickly and his body twitching, Mr Louji told the paper. He was taken to Shami Hospital but efforts to revive him failed. Many observers believe Gen Kanaan's death is connected to the UN investigation into the assassination last February of the former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri - an attack widely blamed on Syria or its allies in Lebanon. Gen Kanaan, who spent 20 years as Syria's military intelligence chief for Lebanon, had been interviewed by the UN investigators, though reportedly he was not a suspect. There is speculation among experts and internet bloggers who follow Syrian affairs that his \"suicide\" - if true - was not voluntary and that he may have been made a scapegoat for Hariri's assassination. \"The timing is extraordinarily coincidental,\" the former US Middle East negotiator Dennis Ross told Associated Press. \"It certainly would look as if someone was trying to create the impression the person responsible for (the Hariri murder) is dead.\" Other speculative theories in circulation suggest Gen Kanaan had been passing unauthorised information to the UN investigators or that he had been preparing to oust President Bashar Assad in the event that UN report accused the Damascus regime of killing Hariri. Gen Kanaan's death came hours after a Lebanese TV station said he had received $10m (\u00a36m) in bribes from Hariri - implying that he had a financial interest in keeping the former Lebanese prime minister alive. Yesterday, Syrian cabinet ministers and military officers watched as Gen Kanaan's four sons carried his coffin from the hospital to an ambulance. A wreath from the president's office was fixed to the front of the ambulance, which led a cortege of 50 black cars. The foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, told reporters that some media outlets had pushed Kanaan to commit suicide - an apparent reference to anti-Syria campaigns by Lebanese newspapers and broadcasters. Mr Sharaa said he was sure the UN report would find Syria innocent of Mr Hariri's killing. In Beirut yesterday, the Lebanese government formally asked the UN to extend the mandate of its investigation into the Hariri assassination until December 15. Speaking after a cabinet meeting, the information minister, Ghazi Aridi, told reporters the government wanted the extension \"to provide support and assistance to the Lebanese judiciary\". Backstory The former Lebanese PM Rafik Hariri died in an explosion in his car in February. Many Lebanese blamed Syria and took to the streets in protests which toppled Lebanon's Syrian-backed government and led to Syrian troops pulling out. The UN set up a team, headed by German prosecutor Detlev Mehlis, to investigate Hariri's killing. In August three of Lebanon's pro-Syrian security chiefs and the head of the presidential guard were arrested. UN investigators later questioned Syrian officials, including interior minister Ghazi Kanaan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
