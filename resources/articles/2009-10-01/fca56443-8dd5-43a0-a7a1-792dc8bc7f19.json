Should we start by mourning the merciless passage of time and its deleterious effects on the indie upstarts who made Swingers 15 years ago, and let their minds and bodies go utterly to seed thereafter? Since success, fame and mega-cash began raining down on Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn about a decade ago, one has been able to detect the degree of wellbeing or depression that afflicts either of them merely by pondering their weight on any given project. Favreau was always on the chunky side, to be fair, and he's been doing fine behind the camera with the Iron Man movies, but back in Swingers, Vaughn had the requisite skinniness to persuade us he really was a half-starved young Hollywood actor. Now he has boy boobs, love handles and back fat. And all this (a lot of this) in a movie that requires him to wear a swimsuit most of the time. Vaughn is threatening to turn into the male version of his vacuous ex-girlfriend Jennifer Aniston (though she does admittedly have better boobs). With Aniston, the usual routine is to find some inoffensive romcom script, rip out its innards and replace them with the allegedly magical presence of the Girl Who Can't Open A Half-Decent Movie Anywhere On The Planet, then stand back and watch the box-office fireworks, which never occur. The results \u2013 such as Rumour Has It, Derailed (whose title was also its most accurate review) or this week's Love Happens \u2013 are all movies in which the greatest creative efforts were expended before the cameras rolled, during the deal-making process. You can almost read the terms of the stars' contracts right up there on the screen, sub-clauses, codicils, addenda, and all. Precisely the same can be said of Vaughn's last two outings \u2013 already lost to misty memory \u2013 Fred Claus and Four Christmases. Vaughn was once Aniston's arm-candy \u2013 The Break-Up will be right there in the video stores to memorialise that bleak fact and taunt him forever \u2013 and something in the heady air-up-there must have stuck with him. Either way, Couples Retreat, which fairly hums with misanthropy and suburban sexual depression insufficiently processed into comedy, falls at exactly the place you'd expect if you graphed out the steady decline in Vaughn's work since Wedding Crashers. I hear that Retreat originally hovered in the disputed territory between the MPAA's PG-13 and R-ratings, just like Wedding Crashers. The latter opted to keep in the knockers and the F-words (and, ugh, John McCain), and at least retained the courage of whatever few convictions it might originally have had. Couples Retreat has all the integrity of a movie that fought for the PG-13 assessment, and lost everything in the process, if there was anything there to lose in the first place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
