There was so little left of the hollowed-out trunk that you could have almost stood inside it, yet the branches were still laden with fruit. It was part of an avenue of trees plantedback in 1702 - no, that\u2019s not a misprint \u2013 that is still productive enough to make several hundred litres of perry every year. How is it possible that we are not more excited about this historic drink, a national treasure that has been woefully overlooked? The answer is one word: Babycham, or more accurately five \u2013 Babycham and then pear cider. Perry is a drink very few understand (it\u2019s basically cider made from pears), and is made from 100% fruit juice, rather than concentrate, as most pear ciders are. There are perry orchards dotted all around the country, but its heartland is the so-called \u201cthree counties\u201d of Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and, particularly, Herefordshire, an area recognised as a praesidium by Slow Food. This year has seen a particularly good harvest \u2013 perry trees don\u2019t fruit every year \u2013 with the ground around each tree carpeted with small, scrubby, green pears that look strangely incongruous considering they have such majestic parents. In fact, that\u2019s how they are harvested: the trees are so tall that they can\u2019t be scaled, so growers (or orchardists, as they\u2019re rather nicely known) have to wait for the fruit to drop, or at least be ripe enough to be shaken off the branches. And then there are the variety names. I defy anyone not to be carried away by the romance and quirkiness of perry pears \u2013 beetroot clows top, hendre huffcap, painted lady, snake pole and zealous wick to name a random few. Some are so rare that they number in single figures- for example, there are only six flakey bark trees in existence, Albert Johnson of Ross on Wye Cider &amp; Perry Company tells me. The flavours, too, are remarkably varied, depending on the pear type, the degree of sweetness and whether the perry is sparkling or still, as well as on whether or not it is filtered and made with indigenous yeasts (the latter attribute makes perry particularly appealing to a growing fan base of natural wine enthusiasts). Most are modest in alcohol, too, with ABVs higher than 7% very unusual. The other big reason to drink perry, if you need one, is price. You can buy a bottle of organic sparkling perry from a small independent grower for the same price as a mass-produced prosecco. Bit of a no-brainer, isn\u2019t it?
