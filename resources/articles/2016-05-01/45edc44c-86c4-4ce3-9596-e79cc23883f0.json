It was very painful.\u201d Canada\u2019s normally staid House of Commons erupted into chaos on Wednesday, after a visibly frustrated Trudeau, the prime minister, strode into a group of MPs, grabbed Conservative Gord Brown by the arm and led him out of the group. Parliamentarians were waiting to vote on a controversial motion from Trudeau\u2019s Liberals to limit debate on assisted suicide legislation. The vote was delayed while several New Democrat MPs \u2013 including Brosseau \u2013 gathered around Brown, seemingly impeding him from taking his place. Trudeau swore as he marched toward Brown, reportedly telling MPs to \u201cget the fuck out of the way\u201d. Footage showed Trudeau elbowing Brosseau, and her wincing in pain, as he pulled Brown away from the group. Brosseau said she felt tears begin to well in her eyes in the aftermath of the incident, prompting her to leave the chamber. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to go running after the prime minister,\u201d she said. \u201cI was shaking \u2026 it is completely inappropriate what happened.\u201d She added: \u201cThe prime minister intentionally walked over, swore at us, reached between a few members of parliament to grab the (Conservative) whip \u2026 how did he think he wasn\u2019t going to hit anybody else?\u201d Trudeau apologised several times this week, including one apology directed at Brosseau. \u201cI want to take the opportunity \u2026 to be able to express directly to [Brosseau] my apologies for my behaviour and my actions, unreservedly,\u201d he said in the House of Commons. Brosseau said she had accepted Trudeau\u2019s apology but noted that he had not reached out to her directly. The incident will now be reviewed by an all-party committee, made up of mostly Liberals, who will determine whether Trudeau should be sanctioned. Brosseau said the incident now left her feeling attacked from all sides. \u201cIf I was a man and I was hit in the nuts, would we be having the same conversation? I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then [people are asking], \u2018Was she hit hard enough in the breast?\u2019 Do I have justify how hard I was hit in the breast? It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
