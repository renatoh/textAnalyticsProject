The Italian and his assistant Ray Wilkins have been told that they must cut costs by either selling a handful of their highest-earning players - Ramon Vega, Stephen Hughes and Patrick Blondeau - or to force those players to take wage cuts. The front-runners to replace Vialli are Joe Kinnear, who has just won promotion from the Third Division with Luton Town, and Ian Holloway who is at Second Division Queens Park Rangers. Although Vialli retains some support on the board at Watford, the desperate drying-up of funds which the ITV Digital crisis threatens has brought the situation to a head. Those at the club who believe that Vialli is not the correct man for their future harbour hopes that Lazio and Parma, both of whom have approached Vialli to take over but been turned down in the last couple of months, will save them the need for compensation by re-approaching the former Chelsea manager. It is understood that Vialli's contract is worded in a way which makes it particularly difficult for Watford to dismiss him during the season, but this weekend will bring Watford's final league match, at home to Gillingham, and Vialli has been told he must report back to the club's executives on Wednesday. It is less than a year since the Juventus legend and European Cup winner was headhunted by the ambitious Vicarage Road board - slightly to the displeasure of the outgoing manager, Graham Taylor, who had recommended Tony Adams. However, Vialli's track record of Cup Winners' Cup, League Cup, FA Cup, Charity Shield and Super Cup winner as Chelsea manager was the overwhelming reason for his choice. His side has often played attractive football but been beset by injuries, notably to the midfielder Hughes. The overtures from Lazio and Parma may well not be enough to tempt him - because Juventus has long been the place he envisages himself managing in Italy when his apprenticeship has been served. The former Walsall manager Ray Graydon will end his three-month exile from football next week when he returns to management and is handed the task of reviving the lagging fortunes of Bristol Rovers' who are currently second from the bottom of the Third Division. Arsenal's manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger will be meeting FA officials next week after offering to give them the benefit of his past experience of Japanese football - Wenger spent four years coaching Japanese Club Grampus Eight - in order to help the logisitics of the England World Cup campaign. The Arsenal midfielder Robert Pires has decided to undergo surgery rather than risk further injury setbacks to his knee after sustaining injury to the cruciate knee ligament - which has ruled him out of the World Cup - during Arsenal's win over Newcastle on March 23. The Sweden striker Marcus Allback, who plays for Dutch club Heerenveen, is attracting interest from Aston Villa, with discussions currently being held between the Villa manager Graham Taylor and the 28-year-old's agent, althought no concrete offer has been made. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
