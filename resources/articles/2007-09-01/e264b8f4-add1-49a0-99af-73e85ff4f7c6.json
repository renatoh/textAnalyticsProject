Fa'asavalu, a 27-year-old who represented Samoa in the 2003 rugby union World Cup, is eligible on residential grounds, and as a keen cricket fan Britain's Australian coach Tony Smith is well aware of the impact Kevin Pietersen made for England in the 2005 Ashes series after qualifying on a similar basis. Fa'asavalu's decision will be a blow to Samoa's league team, who will qualify for next year's World Cup if they beat the US this autumn. \"St Helens and England is the birthplace of my league career and, having only ever played league in this country, both my family and I now feel extremely settled here,\" he explained."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
