Lloyd (also named in the case as Efrem Lloyd) and his partner Vanessa Hunter are being sued by their former friend and business partner Cheryl Conway for $600,000 she invested between 2013 and 2015 to establish the Lupunaluz Foundation and build the Lupunaluz Retreat in Peru. The federal court heard on Monday in the opening argument from Conway\u2019s barrister, Harry Forrester, that Conway had become friends with Lloyd and Hunter after meeting them in 2012. They developed a plan for the retreat, with Conway to invest money, while Lloyd and Hunter would provide the 129-hectare land they owned in Peru for the eco-resort, Forrester said. The resort was designed to adhere to conservation principles and look after the Amazon, involving the local population. \u201cIt\u2019s not a hotel for rich yuppies ... It was going to be a specific healing retreat but also a conservation ... of the rainforest involving the local tribes and local people in the business,\u201d Forrester said. \u201cIt was a healing retreat. In Peru there are numerous medicinal plants [and] shamans [who] practice using nature and plants to treat illness and depression and things like that.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s a shaman?\u201d Justice Paul Anastassiou asked. \u201cHe\u2019s a sort of medicine man, as I understand it,\u201d Forrester replied. \u201cThat probably gives it a rather glib description.\u201d The shaman brought onto the project, named Alfredo, was Hunter\u2019s godfather, the court heard. The local medicine in the Peruvian jungle was a mixture made from hallucinogenic plants that were unavailable legally in Australia, the court heard, but was said to make a person closer to the trees and nature. Lloyd has referred to this in his reporting in the Australian. A \u201cman on the ground\u201d, named in court as Mr Clever, was also brought in on a retainer to take care of issues during construction in Peru. Conway invested hundreds of thousands of dollars, Forrester said. An architect and builders were recruited and businesses set up in Peru and Australia before the retreat was opened in August 2016, Forrester said. However, by that time the relationship between Conway and Lloyd and Hunter had broken down, following disputes about the running of the retreat and the associated foundation. There is now a disagreement between the two parties over whether the land was supposed to be part of the agreement for the establishment of the resort. \u201cWe are left in the position where my client had put all the money into the retreat and the setting up of the foundation,\u201d Forrester said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of money that has been put into this foundation. \u201cIn the end, the land remains the property of Ms Hunter and Mr Lloyd. My client is left with nothing.\u201d The court heard Conway had raised the issue of the land in an email to Lloyd and Hunter about attracting an additional investor, in which Conway stated there should be some form of lease agreement for the use of the land. But Forrester said no lease was ever produced. The court heard the shares in the foundation were split three ways between Conway, Hunt and Lloyd, and half of the profits from the running of the retreat were to go to pay Conway back, with the remaining profit to be split between the three shareholders. Lloyd and Hunter have pleaded that the retreat was never completed and was not in a position to be completed. Forrester said Hunter, in particular, \u201clost interest\u201d in completing and running the retreat, instead focusing on the foundation\u2019s work. An email sent by Conway to the pair noted that the success of the foundation had diverted their attention from the retreat. Conway has claimed to have been locked out of the project. Conway, Lloyd and Hunter are expected to given evidence later this week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
