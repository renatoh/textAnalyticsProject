We need to take smog seriously", "bodyText": "Invisible and insidious, the tiny chemical particles that pollute the air we breathe have become a major cause of death in the UK. Each year, 29,000 premature deaths ,mostly from strokes and heart attacks, are caused by air pollution. This is greater than those deaths triggered annually by obesity or passive smoking. Nor is the problem a new one. For years, the EU has been warning Britain that it faces being fined \u00a3300m a year for failing to make drastic reductions in levels of airborne particulate pollutants emitted by cars, lorries and factories. For their part, successive governments, both Labour and coalition, have simply ignored these warnings, an attitude that the cross-party environmental audit committee has since described as shameful. Last week the consequences of the government's persistent inaction came back to haunt it in a particular painful way when a swathe of highly polluted air lingered over the nation for the best part of a week. Mixed with dust swept in from the Sahara, the cloud was blamed, initially, on overseas factors. It was a \"naturally occurring weather phenomenon\", claimed David Cameron. The implication \u2013 that Britain was simply the victim of unusual meteorological forces beyond its control \u2013 is incorrect, for this is a crisis that is entirely of our own making, and which now needs to be tackled with urgency for the sake of the health of the nation. It will not be an easy process, for the causes of air pollution are complex and tricky to control. At a local level, we need to encourage councils to create clean-air zones and to find ways to discourage cars and trucks from speeding through our streets and roads. In addition, ways must be found to tackle the growing use of diesel engines which are particularly intense producers of particulates. Most of all, however, we need to realise that the air we breathe needs as much protection as our seas and our land."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
