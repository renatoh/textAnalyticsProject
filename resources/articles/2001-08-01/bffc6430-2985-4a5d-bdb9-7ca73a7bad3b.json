The Statement of Good Practice recommends minimum standards of information that pension providers must give to policy holders whose pension plans are about to mature. One key aspect of the code will be the requirement to make clear to consumers that they do not have to buy an annuity from the same company with which they held their pension. Consumers currently have to buy an annuity, which converts a pension fund into taxable income, before they are 75 years old. Due to lower-than-expected returns on investments, annuities are currently at low levels, and consumers can boost their retirement income considerably by shopping around for the best rates. But the ABI found that many people were not aware of the 'open market option', which enables them to buy an annuity from a group offering better rates than their own provider. ABI's director general, Mary Francis, said: \"For most policyholders, buying an annuity with the lump sum they have built up in a pension fund will be one of the most important investments they will ever make. \"The statement will make sure that policyholders have the information they need to make an informed choice about their annuity.\" The statement also recommends that companies make clear the range of options available to people on retirement, including the different types of annuity products available. It also recommends minimum standards for the timing and content of letters sent to policyholders whose pensions are nearing maturity to ensure they receive clear information in good time before they have to make a decision on buying an annuity. The code is voluntary, but the group said it hoped it would become a benchmark of good industry practice. Financial watchdog the Financial Services Authority today welcomed the move as a step in the right direction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
