Kewell has been cited by Fifa for violating article 54 of the governing body's disciplinary code. The article covers \"offensive behaviour\" and the forward faces a two-match ban under Fifa's guidelines. According to Merk's report submitted to Fifa, Kewell said \"You are fucking shit\" to the referee \"several times\". Kewell's team-mate Craig Moore had to pull the Liverpool player away from Merk at the end of the match. The referee had infuriated the Australians because of what they saw as persistent protection of the Brazilian team rather than any specific incident, having awarded Brazil 25 free-kicks and Australia only nine in a game that was played in good spirit. The Australians were angry that the Brazilian striker Fred was not shown a yellow card for removing his shirt after scoring Brazil's second goal. \"I think we played very fair against Brazil,\" Australia's captain Mark Viduka said. \"We play tough but they are making a big deal of it. It wasn't a dirty game at all. It seemed every time we made a tackle we were too rough. When the opposition makes a tackle it is nothing. \"It was not a rough game. It is probably better that the [Australian football association] talks about the refereeing because the players could get caught into saying a few little words in the heat of the moment that we might regret.\" Vince Grella was one of four Australian players on a yellow card from the first game against Japan who was cautious of collecting a second against Brazil that would rule him out of the Croatia game, which Australia cannot afford to lose if they are to progress to the knockout stages. \"I was worried because of the way he was whistling all the time but I got through it without getting booked.\" After the match Kewell was more circumspect about Merk's performance. \"We go out there, we play, and at the end of the day it's his final word,\" he said. Even if he avoids suspension Kewell, who started Sunday's game against Brazil on the substitutes' bench, may not start against Croatia. \"Guus Hiddink is a great manager who knows exactly how he wants to play the game,\" he said. \"He has a plan and I fit in there somewhere along the line. I don't know what the team will be against Croatia. Everyone wants to start but it is down to the manager. If I am on the bench I will just wait for my opportunity and try to make a bit of an impact if I do get on.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
