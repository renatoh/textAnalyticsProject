And she promised to \u201cmake no deals\u201d to compromise her independence. \u201cWhen I am re-elected, I will make no deals that compromise my independence or ability to put the interest of the people of Indi first,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cI will represent. I will lobby and advocate so that our taxes return to us to build the infrastructure and support services.\u201d In front of 500 supporters, McGowan outlined her legislative record and policies but it was a call for both parties to support Australia\u2019s United Nations commitments to asylum seekers that attracted the largest cheer from the Wodonga crowd. \u201cIn regional Australia we seek to be good neighbours to others in time of need,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cThe same should apply to those seeking asylum to our country. I believe the Australian government has a duty of care to protect the safety and health of the people who come here seeking our protection. \u201cI call on both parties to commit to protect people from harm and honour our commitments to the United Nations; to stop detaining children, and to legislate time limits for detention.\u201d McGowan was seeking to kickstart her campaign to win a second term in office in the Victorian seat, after beating the former Liberal frontbencher Sophie Mirabella in 2013. Mirabella is running again in the campaign, as is the National\u2019s candidate Marty Corboy, with Labor candidate Eric Kerr and the Greens candidate Jenny O\u2019Connor. But the three-cornered contest \u2013 McGowan, Mirabella and Corboy \u2013 is the one to watch. At the campaign launch, McGowan made much of her voting record in the 44th parliament. She told the audience that out of 547 bills, she voted with the Coalition on 443 occasions, Labor on 32 occasions, and nine times against both major parties. The government passed 475 bills. She rejected the major party view of independents \u2013 suggesting the regional seat had a \u201creal presence\u201d in Canberra. \u201cIndi really matters now and is getting more attention than ever,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cMaking the seat marginal and competitive has delivered for Indi.\u201d \u201cFears of the electorate being starved of funding with an independent at the helm proved false. In excess of $800m of taxpayers\u2019 money has been committed to Indi and it continues.\u201d McGowan, who campaigned on mobile black spots in 2013, claimed her collaborative work establishing the Indi Telecommunication Action Group brought about the construction of 30 mobile phone towers under the Coalition. \u201cThis result was outstanding,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cBut the way we did it \u2013 the Indi Way \u2013 was even more impressive and showed how the collective momentum of working together is greater than the sum of the parts.\u201d And in a direct rebuff to the National party, she claimed no major party had a vision for regional Australia. \u201cRegional development underpins the majority of my work in parliament \u2013 there\u2019s such a gap \u2013 with no major party having a strong coherent plan for regional Australia,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cWe need a national approach to building our regions - including regional higher education, regional health, regional manufacturing, regional transport \u2013 indeed we need a vision for regional Australia.\u201d McGowan outlined her support for marriage equality and flagged that she would vote in favour for any bill to come before the parliament, notwithstanding the Coalition\u2019s intention to hold a plebiscite on the issue. McGowan also pledged to support fixed four year terms, which are a feature of the New South Wales parliament. McGowan said a grassroots community event called the Indi Summit identified three issues that mattered to the electorate, employment opportunities, particularly for young people, renewable energy and the role of the arts. \u201cThere was a clear message from the Summit that our planet matters: there is a unique opportunity for Indi to work together to increase our use of renewable energy and thus lessen our carbon foot print,\u201d McGowan said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
