In the last few years palaeontology, the study of fossils, has evolved from a profession people know little about to regular leisure viewing on mainstream TV. 'Walking with Beasts', and the three Jurassic Park films reflect and encourage this growing fascination with dinosaurs. The field of palaeontology is incredibly diverse, every living organism is specialised in from dinosaurs to fossil insects and snails. Natural history is often a passion from a very early age for palaeontologists. There are two main routes in; the first is professional, a degree in palaeobiology, geology, zoology, botany, or any subject that lends itself to palaeontology. From here you can move into fieldwork, museums, or do a masters in micropalaeontology (the study of microscopic fossils) and work for the oil industry. To get into academia a masters degree is required, followed by a PhD in palaeontology. Alternatively, amateur palaeontologists come in through the back door by working on digs and selling any fossils found. Income Palaeontologists earn different levels of wages depending what role they work in. A senior lecturer at a university can earn \u00a330,000, with junior lecturers starting on around \u00a320,000. Work for a local museum pays from \u00a317,000 to around \u00a350,000 at the top level. However, work for the media can bring in extra capital. Micropalaeontologists can earn between \u00a3500 and \u00a3600 a day for well-site work. But palaeontologists just starting out are paid very little as there is intense competition. An army of amateur palaeontologists will also willingly volunteer, and work for free on digs. Perks There is immense scope for travel to do field work. Each trip offers fresh opportunities for discoveries and there is enjoyment and freedom in concentrating on your own specific research. International conferences also involve travel and give palaeontologists the chance to keep on top of new developments and research. Palaeontologists who work in museums and universities can share their enthusiasm with others. Disadvantages Travel across the world is great but the tropical diseases you can pick up along the way are not so enjoyable. Scorpion stings, snake bites and dysentery may make good stories after the event, but at the time are not funny and are potentially lethal. Lecturers at universities find the increasing weight of administration a burden. The money earnt by most palaeonologists is not huge - the reward is the vocation itself rather than material wealth. The Future Public awareness of palaeontology and natural history is increasing thanks to television. With life-like computer effects it is fascinating to watch and learn about dinosaurs and how they are thought to have behaved. Such programs make it easier for people to visualise what the earth was once like and be inspired to find out about the past through fossils. As a result palaeontology is undergoing a renaissance in the public eye. My view: Dave Martill Dr Dave Martill is a reader in palaeobiology at Portsmouth University. He has been a palaeontologist for 25 years and appeared on 'Live from Dinosaur Island' with Bill Oddie on BBC 2 last summer. He has also been on Radio 4. 'I have been interested in palaeontology since I was a kid. I specialise in dinosaurs and have done field work in Brazil, Chile, Jordan, Mexico and Morocco to name a few places. 'The future of palaeontology is very rosy. I think that people are becoming aware from TV programmes that there is a phenomenal heritage to be discovered. More and more people are beginning to get involved, hoping that they might discover something really amazing.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
