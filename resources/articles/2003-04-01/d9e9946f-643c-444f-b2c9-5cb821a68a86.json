Gregory has been suspended from his duties as Derby manager for the past five weeks after the allegations, which include criticisms of his management methods by Craig Burley. The Scottish international midfielder is also considering legal action against the club after missing a year's play because of injury. Burley claims his recovery was delayed because Gregory and the Derby physio Stuart Walker ignored the advice of the club's former physio, Alan Watson, whom he hired privately. Walker and the coach Ross MacLaren, who were both at Aston Villa when Gregory was manager and followed him to Pride Park, have been suspended for four weeks. Walker's hearing was due to take place yesterday, with MacLaren's scheduled for today. Barcelona's coach Raddy Antic has agreed a one-year extension to his contract with the Catalan giants. The Serbian took the helm in January after Louis van Gaal was sacked in the wake of a disastrous start to the domestic campaign which saw Barca slip perilously close to the relegation places. Since taking the hot seat Antic has guided the club to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, where they lost to Juventus, and has been credited with restoring morale at the Nou Camp."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
