Set up by the Orwell Foundation, the \u00a33,000 prize is intended to reward those books that best meet Orwell\u2019s ambition \u201cto make political writing into an art\u201d. Lynskey\u2019s The Ministry of Truth, which traces the origins of Nineteen Eighty-Four to the time Orwell spent fighting on the republican side in the Spanish civil war, is up against 11 other titles. These include Guardian journalist Amelia Gentleman\u2019s expos\u00e9 The Windrush Betrayal, Caroline Criado Perez\u2019s Invisible Women, about the gender data gap, and the poet Kate Clanchy\u2019s memoir of life as a teacher, Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me. \u201cNone of us are thinking about life in quite the same way as we were even a few weeks ago. Politics looks and feels very different too,\u201d admitted head of Bloomberg Economics and chair of judges Stephanie Flanders. \u201cBut the books on this year\u2019s longlist are not about ordinary politics. In fact, most aren\u2019t about mainstream politics at all. They are, though, political in the most important sense: they cast fresh light on something that matters and perhaps inspire us to consider how things might be better.\u201d Also in the running for the prize are Julia Lovell\u2019s Maoism: A Global History, Robert Macfarlane\u2019s journey to the world beneath our feet, Underland, and Azadeh Moaveni\u2019s investigation into the women of Islamic State, Guest House for Young Widows. Flanders added that all 12 books were also \u201ca good and satisfying read \u2026 We surely need those more than ever.\u201d The longlist for the \u00a33,000 Orwell prize for political fiction was also announced on Wednesday, ranging from Lucy Ellmann\u2019s Ducks, Newburyport, a stream of consciousness from a middle-aged woman in Ohio, to Bernardine Evaristo\u2019s Booker-winning Girl, Woman, Other and Attica Locke\u2019s Heaven, My Home, in which a black Texas Ranger investigates the disappearance of a white supremacist\u2019s son. Nine of the 13 longlisted titles are written by women. Chair of judges for the fiction prize, Jude Kelly, said the lineup \u201cpays homage to the ability of the writer\u2019s voice to absorb political power structures and return them to us in stories of personal identity, community tensions, how the long tail of history impacts on the present, and the emerging strength of women to define what \u2018political\u2019 means.\u201d The shortlists will be announced in mid-May, with the winners to be revealed on 25 June, Orwell\u2019s birthday.
