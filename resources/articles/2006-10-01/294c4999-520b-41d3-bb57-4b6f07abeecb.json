The performances against Macedonia and Croatia contained so much slapstick goonery that it would not have been visually jarring to see Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton at the heart of England's defence - and Fatty Arbuckle would have been an advantage between the sticks. Watching the usually impeccable John Terry play at international level is like being forced to endure the spectacle of Marlon Brando playing Widow Twankey in an amateur dramatic production of Aladdin. \"It's behind you, John,\" yelled the mob, and the \"it\" in question was Paul Robinson, thrashing wildly at the air like someone being pursued by an imaginary bee. Confounded by a divot, this being a word that will enter the public consciousness much as Florida's \"hanging chads\" did in the infamous presidential election of 2000, or \"metatarsal\" did when David Beckham, then Wayne Rooney, broke one. Since Wednesday I think of nought but divots. \"Oh, we've been defeated by a divot.\" Perhaps now England should field a team of 11 divots and, given a chance to represent our unduly proud nation, I fancy that the divots will be grateful for the opportunity and will provoke less scandal. Before long we will see razor blades and pizzas endorsed by millionaire divots. Alas, when performing for England, the reverse alchemy of the three lions on their chest seems to be turning golden club players into base-metal internationals. Admittedly, for this performance we were without Steven Gerrard, Joe Cole and the ever-electrifying Aaron Lennon. It seems impertinent to already be thinking, \"Oh, perhaps Theo Walcott will save us,\" like a pacy teenage Jesus, after Sven was so heavily chided for including him in the England squad. His two goals at Under-21 level are a cause for optimism. But what also concerns me is the succinct insight offered by West Ham alumnus Slaven Bilic. England, he correctly noted, are incapable of playing 3-5-2 - Ashley Cole and Gary Neville are full-backs and inevitably England will play with a five-man defence. When hearing these comments I thought, \"Who knew this Slaven Bilic was concealing a neurological Catherine Wheel of tactical whizz-bangs?\" Were it not for the appalling suit he wore, I'd be campaigning for him to become the next England manager. Seems early, doesn't it, to be demanding that Steve McClaren be sacked, but that's what I am doing in this column. I think we have made a terrible mistake. I think McClaren became manager by default. It was only because of the FA's ghastly mishandling of the appointment of the next manager that it was not Phil Scolari presiding over the Croatia match. Can you honestly imagine England losing with that big, charismatic, swarthy sasquatch of a man in the dressing room? He would not permit defeat at the hands of a former Hammers upstart dressed in a suit that Burton would reject for being \"tawdry\". One can scarcely condemn McClaren for accepting the job any more than one would damn a tinker for accepting the role of governor of the Bank of England. He's unlikely to say, \"You can poke your mint, I'm happy with my pots and pans.\" Most football managers provoke incredible emotional reactions: 'arry 'arry Redknapp with his unreconstructed barra' boy charm; Sam Allardyce with his fierce northern passion; even Sven's professorial indifference provoked antipathy from fans. But McClaren is defined only by the fact that he is difficult to define. The unpopular meddling with his formation has proved to be desperately unwise and it does rile me somewhat that while Croatian fans can manage to formulate a perfect swastika in the stands, we can't even organise our own defence. Christ. England don't play competitively for another five months, so there will be no real opportunity for this team to integrate. Perhaps by then Scolari, Martin O'Neill, or Allardyce and Alan Curbishley as some hilariously mismatched odd couple, could be in control of the national side. But if not, the panto season may continue long into the spring and our game against Israel in March will see the undignified spectacle of much-loved heroes playing like horses with two left feet and girls in roles traditionally occupied by men."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
