Maybe the result of Kazakstan affected a few people. Getting the second was important.. They thought they were in the game. That put the frighteners on the fans.. they were looking for five or six and we accept that. It\u2019s very important that we won the game, but in the end we should have had four or five. We got a whirlwind start against us. It really set us back and left a few of us shellshocked. We dealt with the second game, if not fantastically, it was professional enough. Alex McLeish speaks...briefly. The TV broadcast had a wobble; he didn\u2019t storm out. We started really well, played well, getting the first goal early and trying to push on for another one Because we didn\u2019t get the second goal, we were a bit nervy. It\u2019s been a tough few days for everybody. When we got the second, I think you saw the team relaxing and we went to create another five or six chances. Scotland goalscorers Kenny McLean and Johnny Russell speak. KMc: \u201cWe got off to a good start. After that, it was a tough state. We could have had more on the night. It\u2019s good to get the goal, but we needed more. They were never going to change.\u201d JR: \u201cJamesey came in and did what Jamesey does. I managed to cut inside and get it away. It\u2019s disappointing and frustrating we didn\u2019t get more on the night. We could have done more, we should have created more. It\u2019s a win we expected to get but it could have been a lot better for us.\u201d The tweets are in, and the Scots are not happy. The ordeal is over, though that performance will have done little to quell the criticism and soothe the pain of Kazakhstan. San Marino might not have had a shot on target but Scotland did not play at all well. The time between McLean\u2019s goal and that of Russell was almost 70 minutes of frustration. 90+3 min: McTominay gets another whack, this time from Berardi. There will be some bumps and bruises in the dressing room. 90+2 min: Four minutes of time added on. McTominay is booked for a foul on Lunadei. Perhaps a bit of revenge being served there. 90 min: McTominay took another of those whacks but seems to be ok. Scotland playing keep ball. San Marino are exhausted....Robertson, still going, overhits his cross - or was it a cross - and another chance going begging. 89 min: Scotland look to be settling for their regulation 2-0 scoreline. And they haven\u2019t deserved much more, in truth. 88 min: Simon McMahon is getting giddy: \u201cWe are the best in the world. We have beaten San Marino at football. It is completely unbelievable. Franco Varella, Aldo Simoncini, Massimo Bonini, Little Tony, Valentina Monetta, The Pope, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Your boys took a hell of a beating - A HELL OF A BEATING\u201d 86 min: Off goes Simoncini, and on come some younger legs in Battistini. 84 min: Robertson hits a fine long pass, and McNulty runs on to it. He gets a shot in but it is from a narrow angle, as the keeper had closed down the angle rather adeptly. San Marino have actually done well in terms of defending, and the goalkeeper, Benedettini, has been decent, too. 83 min: Simoncini comes back, a tad ginger. Forrest, who played a part in Russell\u2019s goal, is pinning back the San Marino defence with his running down the right. 81 min: Captain Simoncini, who has put in a hell of a shift in defence, has cramp and collapses to the floor in agony. 79 min: McNulty\u2019s head doesn\u2019t go down, and he has another stab at scoring the third, his shot is blocked. 77 min: What a miss! McNulty has a free header in front of goal, and somehow nods it wide and behind. Awful, frankly, a near-Iwulemo. 76 min: O\u2019Donnell blows the chance to make it three and McLeish to write his name into the record books when he makes a mess of a pass that to Fraser. 75 min: Russell has just figuratively wiped the brow and given a valium to his manager. This was getting very edgy indeed. Phew! San Marino got ambitious and when the ball was cleared, McNulty\u2019s dummy allowed Russell space to run, check and rattle his shot into the net. He made no mistake. 72 min: A sliver of a chance for Fraser, but Simoncini carries out a fine block to stop the shot reaching the goalkeeper. McLeish\u2019s pallor is even paler than normal on the touchline. 71 min: James Forrest is imminent as a sub...and comes on for Armstrong, who has been one of Scotland\u2019s better players. 68 min: This is getting edgy, and there are probably knives being sharpened, and keyboards being pummelled at Scotland\u2019s performance here. They have been increasingly poor against the worst team in the world. 66 min: This is now a full session of attack v defence, as San Marino\u2019s energy levels appear to have dropped off a cliff. Nanni tried to mount a lone attack then made a ludicrous dive when McTominay breathed on him. The Scot\u2019s next move is, sadly, a poor pass. 66 min: The actual Simon McMahon emails in: \u201cGood evening John, and thank you Matt. My liver is fine (for now), my sanity - well, 40 years of supporting Scotland will test anyone\u2019s patience. Andy Robertson, Stuart Armstrong and Johnny Russell all played for Dundee United btw, make of that what you will.\u201d 64 min: Scotland are being given time on the ball but appear to have no idea what to do with it, though Fraser\u2019s ball almost found Russell before McTominay blazes over. 62 min: On the bench, Alex McLeish looks pained. And assistant Peter Grant looks enraged. 60 min: San Marino sub: Nanni of Crotone, a teenager, comes on for Vitaioli and will play as a forward. 59 min: Corner number nine, to which the goalkeeper is equal. Fraser\u2019s cross meets a similar fate. Scotland\u2019s best hope appears to be equalling that record score line of 2-0. 58 min: O\u2019Donnell escapes to the byline after some neat interplay with McTominay, but his final ball is not good enough. 57 min: Substitution: Scott McTominay comes on for McGregor. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho likes this. 56 min: McNulty shows determination, and wins the space to force a save. The eighth Scottish corner comes to McKenna, who can\u2019t direct his header. 55 min: Scotland win a seventh corner, but McLean is penalised for a foul on his marker. 53 min: Another San Marino shot, this time from Palazzi. It\u2019s no threat, and wide, but there is a belief building in the world\u2019s worst team. 52 min: Scotland have started this half like they ended the first, and that\u2019s a worry. Some rage from Russell as a move breaks down. He stamped his feet like a small child meant. At the other end, a frankly hilarious dive for a penalty from Berardi. The referee doesn\u2019t even acknowledge it. And rightly so. 50 min: Andy Robertson charges down the flank in typical style to chase a lost cause. He can\u2019t keep the ball in but Scotland need more urgency like that. 48 mins: Cyprus were winning 5-0 against San Marino by this point on Thursday, it might be pointed out. 47 min: The game settles into the same pattern as the first half, and Scotland will want a second goal to arrive just as quickly as it did in the opening moments. 46 min: We are back underway, as San Marino take the kick-off. And immediately concede possession, which is probably the plan. Stat attack. An email, from Matthew Dony: \u201cI have no strong feelings towards Scotland, but in the spirit of MBM solidarity, I support Simon McMahon. I really hope Scotland actually turn up for this game, for the sake of Simon\u2019s liver and sanity (in that order).\u201d Simon\u2019s liver may be a lost cause after the second half of that half. When McLean scored, this looked a formality for Scotland. It has become anything but, and the boos at half-time most definitely came from the away fans. Oh dear. 45 min: Johnny Russell hacked down. Another free-kick chance. Can Scotland force Benedettini into a save. Two minutes of time added on in this half. Russell hits the wall and then his rebound attempt is poor. He\u2019s not at Kansas City Wizards any more. 44 min: Armstrong finds Fraser, in a rare amount of space but the cross is very poor. Such chances are few and far between as this game rolls on so that is a terrible waste. 43 min: O\u2019Donnell concedes a foul, which I make the Scots\u2019 first of the game. San Marino\u2019s count is considerably higher. 41 min: Russell is forced to go back the wrong way. San Marino have constructed a defensive wall that Scotland are struggling to breach. 39 min: \u201cTake him on, come on,\u201d shouts McLeish from the sidelines to Robertson. It has to be said that Scotland have become a little too predictable. 37 min: Russell is clattered by Hirsch in the latest of a series of hefty challenges. McNulty, belatedly, is on the field in place of Paterson. He was delayed by having to put tape on his socks. Yes, really. 35 min: The bagpipes have started up again. Andy Robertson takes a hell of a whack from Battastini, but gets up just fine. Relief for those who dare to dream in Liverpool. 34 min: Paterson will be unable to continue. Mark McNulty of Hibs will be coming on. Reminder that Paterson couldn\u2019t play in Nur Sultan because of the plastic pitch, and now this. 33 min: Another San Marino shot from Palazzi, advancing onwards from defence. It\u2019s wide but there is excitement at the home team\u2019s improvement. 32 min: Paterson\u2019s header forces a save, and the Cardiff striker goes down heavily. His ankle appears to be the problem. Neil Warnock\u2019s language is almost certainly x-rated at this point. Then again, it probably is most of the time. 30 min: Oh no! San Marino go close, and for a moment it looked as if they had scored. Hirsch hits the side-netting. And there is a chorus of boos. From the visiting fans? Very possibly. 29 min: A San Marino attack with the Golinucci Bros to the fore breaks down and the Scots can break through Johnny Russell. He doesn\u2019t get far, though. 27 min: What standard would San Marino be if they played in the English leagues? Difficult to work out. But I am saying North West Counties leagues. They like to mix it, and there have been a few audible complaints from the Scots over some of the tackling. 26 min: San Marino take their time over a throw-in halfway up into the Scottish territory. We are reminded they have not scored a goal at home since 2013. 24 min: Fraser is hacked down, cynically as you like, by Mularoni, just on the edge of the area. A conference is held over who will take the free-kick, to the left of the area. Fraser takes, and misses the target. Not his best effort. 22 min: Another Scotland corner. San Marino, aside from the goal, have done OK with those. 21 min: Great work from Paterson to head down for Armstrong, who forces two saves from Benedettini. Two very good saves, in fact. 20 min: Scotland trying to find the calming release of a second goal. They are forcing the issue, as well they might. A lone bagpipe sounds in the mountain air. 19 min: Fraser finds space and whips in a cross to Paterson but it is just too high. 17 min: Paterson is the target for a long pass from Robertson. San Marino\u2019s 8-2-0 formation doesn\u2019t give him much room to work in but expect plenty of those to rain down. 15 min: Scotland choose to pass calmly, and wait for the final ball. An actual San Marino attack is actually mounted but the ball is swiftly back with Scott Bain. 13 min: San Marino are not exactly chasing an equaliser. That is both the result and reason for the fact that they last *drew* a game in 2014. 11 min: Scotland get a corner, which Fraser booms in. It\u2019s cleared, and then some panicky defending follows on from that. Each Scotland attack brings a shriek from what sounds like the goalkeeper. He does this while rooting himself on his line. He\u2019s not exactly Peter Schmeichel. 9 min: The San Marino from some local children is quite quaint. The Tartan Army\u2019s songs are being delivered in a far more guttural fashion. 7 min: Scotland are not looking to sit back on this. Remember, winning 3-0 would be a record scoreline away in San Marino for them. OK, it won\u2019t make up for Thursday but it would be nice. Relief! A deft header from McLean and Scotland have the lead. Nice work from Ryan Fraser after a short coe 3 min: Scotland already piling it on, Fraser\u2019s cross comes out, and Kenny McLean shoots wide. Speculative, but again, it\u2019s a good sign. 2 min: Early sighter for Paterson, as O\u2019Donnell finds him. He misses the target but an encouraging sign the Cardiff man can find some space. A lovely spring evening, and away we go in San Marino. Flower of Scotland, that historic anthem from way back in, er, 1974, tiddly om pom poms to a rather nice bagpipe and brass combination. The San Marinese anthem is austere, quite forbidding. It has no words, like Spain\u2019s. Scotland have been to San Marino three times before, and each game was won 2-0, a scoreline that looks a little too close for comfort. San Marino have won just one of their 155 internationals, mind. The teams are in the tunnel, and the Tartan Army are in full swing already. They have had sorrows to drown, of course. The Auld Enemy are in action tomorrow, and Nick Ames has the lowdown on the Montenegro assignment. Wales got a pretty decent result in today\u2019s match in Cardiff. Dan James looks like a real prospect. Another reminder that Andy Robertson missed the last game for dental surgery. Root canal or losing 3-0 to Kazakhstan? Tough call. Turns out he had an abscess in his gum. Ouch. A reminder that San Marino are Fifa ranked as the worst team in the world. No pressure, then, Scotland. Alex McLeish speaks: We said we would use the squad. Some players are disappointed. That\u2019s great, it shows they want to play for the team. I said I was going freshen things up for the second game. (On Calum Paterson) He has played some decent games for Cardiff. He\u2019s a good focal point. We aren\u2019t gong to just pump the ball at him. We want to bounce back. We have prepared the guys pretty well. One of the things Scotland do a lot is bounce back. The Scottish team have a lot of making up to do. San Marino team: Benedettini, Battistini, Simoncini, Cevoli, Palazz, Mularoni, Golinucci, Golinucci, Berardi, Vitaioli, Hirsch. Subs: Zavoli, Benedettini, Cesarini, Grandoni, Brolli, Battistini, Lunadei, Giardi, Rinaldi, Censoni, Tomassini, Nanni Alessandro and Enrico Golinucci are San Marino\u2019s Gary and Phil Neville, probably. Callum Paterson comes in as striker, no start for McTominay as six changes are made. James Forrest, Liam Palmer, Graeme Shinnie, John McGinn, Oliver Burke and Oli McBurnie have been dropped. Paterson, Ryan Fraser and Johnny Russell are the attacking trio. Stephen O\u2019Donnell and skipper Andy Robertson are the full-backs positions. Kenny McLean is in midfield. The other five who started in Kazakhstan can count themselves as most fortunate. Team: Bain, O\u2019Donnell, Robertson, Bates, McKenna, McGregor, Russell, McClean, Paterson, Armstrong, Fraser Subs: McLaughlin, Kelly, Palmer, Souttar, Fleck, McGinn, McTominay, Shinnie, Burke, Forrest, McBurnie, McNult Here\u2019s the Scotland team. The Tartan Army are reaching for a higher power. Archie Gemmill is 72 today. My heart was broken, my heart was broken Sorrow Sorrow Sorrow Sorrow My heart was broken, my heart was broken You saw it, You claimed it You touched it You saved it. For those of a Caledonian persuasion, Thursday night was a night to lean on the melancholic beauty of The Proclaimers\u2019 Sunshine On Leith. Not that they did much saving against Kazakhstan. A glance back at the goals conceded in Nur_Sultan, as we must now call Astana, and you will see some rather good play from the Kazakhs, but coupled with some of the most clueless, listless defending of our age. Frankly, it is a wonder Alex McLeish is still in a job, though the SFA surely took pity on him; he looked positively traumatised afterwards. This was Scottish doom of the type not even Private Frazer could countenance, a footballing Culloden. Still, it couldn\u2019t happen in San Marino, could it?.. Could it?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
