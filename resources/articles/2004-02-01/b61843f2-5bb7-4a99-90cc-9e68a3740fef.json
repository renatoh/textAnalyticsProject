Early in the second half his stumble and flailing punch almost resulted in an embarrassing own-goal. James also dropped his first catch and then threw the ball straight out for a throw-in before conceding from a Pauleta free-kick. 4/10 Phil Neville The defender-cum-midfielder may have created a niche at Old Trafford as a holding player, but for England he is still the odd-job man. Plugging in the gap vacated by his brother Gary, Neville has now established himself ahead of Danny Mills as the first-choice replacement at right-back. 7 Ledley King A confident and hugely impressive performance from the Tottenham player, whose ambitions for the night might have been limited beforehand to preserving his dignity. Mission accomplished: King made some telling interceptions, looked calm and assured and, having played a decisive part in Jorge Andrade's mistake for the England goal, it would be harsh for him to be omitted from the squad to face Sweden next month. 8 Gareth Southgate Eradicated the harrowing memories of his last game, against Slovakia last June, but the perfectionist in Sven-Goran Eriksson will have noted how Pauleta eluded his challenge midway through the first-half, enticing the free-kick from which Luis Figo nearly scored. 7 Ashley Cole Indebted to David James for denying Luis Figo an early goal after blundering with what should have been a routine clearance before an injury forced his early departure. 4 David Beckham One accusation that could never be levelled at England's captain is that friendlies bring out a lackadaisical side to him. As industrious as ever, Beckham's free-kick was the catalyst for England's goal and, yet again, the most competent midfield player in a white shirt - without being anything close to spectacular. 7 Nicky Butt The usual quota of tackles, clearances and short but effective passes, yet dispossessed in midfield more times than he would care to remember and occasionally caught out by the fast-breaking Portuguese midfielders. 6 Paul Scholes Has reason to be grateful that Eriksson is such an admirer. Scholes will not care to be reminded that it is now 25 matches since his last England goal, a sequence stretching back to the World Cup qualifier against Greece in June 2001. At Manchester United he is unsurpassed in his position, but for England he lacks the same attacking adventure. 6 Frank Lampard A peripheral figure for long periods, certainly when compared with the influential player we have seen at Stamford Bridge this season. Lampard need not fret he did too much wrong but drifting to the left of midfield is not his forte and Eriksson will long for the prolonged health of Steven Gerrard this summer. 5 Michael Owen Volleyed his one chance of the first half wide and most of his impressive work was carried out 30 yards from goal, where he held up the ball impressively. 7 Wayne Rooney Dovetailed impressively with Michael Owen throughout the opening exchanges, showing a good appreciation of his strike partner's movement, but seldom manoeuvred himself into scoring positions. 6 Substitutes Wayne Bridge (replaced Cole, 17mins) - Competent as a replacement left-back. 6. Danny Mills (replaced Neville, ht) - His positional sense was sometimes lacking. 5 Kieron Dyer (replaced Scholes ht) - Sir Bobby Robson being in the crowd could not coax a masterly performance. 6. Joe Cole (replaced Lampard ht) - Flitted in and out, like Lampard. 6. Alan Smith (Owen 70) Emile Heskey (Rooney 70)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
