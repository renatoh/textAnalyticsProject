Wright, a graduate of the Anfield youth system, played 17 games last season and scored against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League. But although he signed a three-year deal in 2001 he has become surplus to requirements because of the return to fitness of Markus Babbel and the presence of the versatile Jamie Carragher and Abel Xavier. The 22-year-old Wright is expected to discuss terms with Peter Reid today and is likely to be one of two players signed by the Sunderland manager in time for the new season, with Reid also hopeful of adding the Rangers striker Tore Andre Flo to his squad. Reid will miss his team's match with Algeciras tonight after flying back yesterday from a tour of Spain. He was due to watch next Saturday's opponents Blackburn take on Lazio last night and travel to Merseyside for talks with Wright before attending today's Everton match with Athletic Bilbao. Paul Okon is expected to sign for Leeds United over the weekend after having a medical yesterday. The 31-year-old Australian played under Terry Venables at Middlesbrough before spending most of last season at Watford. Franco Baresi's long-term future at Fulham was under scrutiny last night after it emerged that his role has been cut back since his appointment as director of football in May and that his original deal has also been reduced from two years to six months. Ian Pearce, Steve Lomas and Trevor Sinclair have all agreed new deals at West Ham and Jermain Defoe is expected to follow suit soon. \"Trevor agreed to sign a new contract a couple of weeks ago, which we were delighted about,\" said the Hammers' manager Glenn Roeder. \"The same goes for Ian Pearce and Steve Lomas. And although we have got Jermain on a long-term contract already, because he did so well last year we would like to make it even longer.\" West Bromwich Albion's left-back Neil Clement yesterday signed a new three-year contract only a day after the Scotland striker Scott Dobie signed a new four-year deal at the club. \"I can now concentrate on proving to people I'm a Premiership player and trying to force my way into the England reckoning,\" Clement said. \"I can't wait for the Manchester United game.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
