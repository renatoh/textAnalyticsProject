And his name is David Copperfield.\" But then David Copperfield (10.45am and repeated, Radio 4) was partly Dickens's own story. His debt-ridden father was much like Mr Micawber, forever convinced \"something will turn up\". Like David, Dickens was taken out of school to work in a factory. Like David, Dickens worked as a journalist. And so on ... The novel, which Tolstoy considered \"the greatest achievement of the greatest of all novelists\", has now been dramatised by Mike Walker. The 20-part adaptation stars Robert Glenister as the narrator, and Steven Williams and Michael Legge as the young and old Davids. Elsewhere, the BBC's gearing up for Thursday's Lennon Night, marking 25 years since his murder in New York. Songs in the Key of Lennon (3.30pm and repeated, Radio 4) looks at the stories behind five of the former Beatle's songs. Today it's Help! Or, if you just want a good laugh, there's another chance to hear one of the most consistently funny comedies. That's The Hudson and Pepperdine Show (11.30pm, BBC7)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
