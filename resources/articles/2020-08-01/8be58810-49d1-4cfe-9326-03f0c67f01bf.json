Yarde posted on Twitter condemning the treatment of his fellow players, as part of a powerful statement. \u201cI stand 100% for the Black Lives Matter movement and wholeheartedly believe in the importance of highlighting the continuous battle that we face in society every day and the need for a change,\u201d Yarde said. \u201cI have to also stand against death threats against my teammates which is totally unacceptable. This behaviour will not make the world a better place.\u201d Yarde has taken a knee before both of Sale\u2019s matches since the restart, along with three teammates against Harlequins and four against Exeter last Friday. On both occasions, eight South African players in the Sale squad elected to remain standing. Nathi Mthethwa, the country\u2019s sports minister, has called on the South African Rugby Union to intervene, and a number of the players have come in for fierce criticism on social media. Unlike Premier League footballers who have taken a knee in unison before matches, Premiership rugby players have been divided on how best to show their support for anti-racism. Some clubs, such as Harlequins, have taken a knee together while others have all stood and some, like Sale, have been split. Before both of their matches, all Sharks players have worn T-shirts bearing the message \u201cRugby Against Racism\u201d. On the eve of the season, the Rugby Players\u2019 Association insisted that each player\u2019s individual right to make a choice must be respected and while the Sale director of rugby, Steve Diamond, last week dismissed the South African sports minister\u2019s comments as \u201ca storm in a teacup\u201d, Yarde\u2019s statement \u2013 understood to be in reference to comments on social media \u2013 demonstrates it is anything but. The RPA said on Monday it was aware of the situation but Premiership Rugby, Sale and the RFU did not comment. While a number of the Premiership players electing not to kneel are South African, the England No 8 Billy Vunipola has also chosen to stand before both of Saracens\u2019 matches since the restart. Last week, Vunipola explained his decision by saying that the Black Lives Matter movement was at odds with his religious beliefs, claiming, \u201cThey were burning churches and Bibles. I can\u2019t support that. Even though I am a person of colour, I\u2019m still more a person of, I guess, Jesus.\u201d There is little evidence to support the claim the movement has burned any churches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
