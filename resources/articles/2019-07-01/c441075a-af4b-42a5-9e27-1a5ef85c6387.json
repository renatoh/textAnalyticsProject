He is a phenomenal athlete. He has the best team around him to support him and he has many great years ahead. He\u2019s got good support with his family. He\u2019s a humble guy with a very bright future.\u201d Brailsford believes the youthful Bernal still has room for improvement. \u201cHe might progress, we don\u2019t know. But there are a lot of areas that he can improve, that\u2019s for sure, and not just in pure power terms. Like for like, at his age, he\u2019s pretty exceptional compared to everybody else.\u201d Bernal, who crossed the line in Paris behind stage winner Caleb Ewan from Australia, is the third-youngest winner of the Tour and his success makes him the seventh rider in eight years from a Brailsford-managed team to win the Tour. With Chris Froome now working to rehabilitate himself from injury and a disappointed Thomas desperate to return to his race-winning level of 2018, Ineos may have three leaders vying for supremacy on next year\u2019s Tour start line in Nice. \u201cIf all three of us are there on the start line \u2013 me, Froomey and Egan \u2013 jeez, we\u2019re going to have some questions about leadership,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cBut the other teams will have to answer those questions on the road. We\u2019ve always been honest, clear and communicated with each other, so it will be great to have that strength next year.\u201d Brailsford rejected the suggestion that a switch in emphasis to supporting South American talent, such as Bernal and the probable new signing, Richard Carapaz, the Giro d\u2019Italia champion from Ecuador, meant Ineos had deserted its roots. \u201cWe very much have a British heart and we\u2019ll continue flying the flagwith British riders,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the reality is, it\u2019s a global sport. To win the Tour de France, you want the best riders.\u201d A Colombian rider with a Spanish coach, that\u2019s a whole new challenge to do something we hadn\u2019t done before. Can we make that succeed? That mentality isn\u2019t a cut and paste. \u201cWe are going to have to really think about Xabi [Artetxe] coaching and supporting him for him to get the best out of Egan and the guys. That\u2019s why I went to Colombia in January. I thought, \u2018Can we produce the culture that\u2019s going to get the best out of them?\u2019 rather than expecting them to adapt to our culture which is different.\u201d While Thomas acknowledged that he and Froome, both approaching their mid\u2011thirties, now faced competition from Brailsford\u2019s collection of prodigious young talents, he was dismissive of those who are suggesting he is past his best. \u201cI don\u2019t read it, although certain stuff filters through to me and spurs me on\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a lot closer to the end than the start: me and Egan are on separate spectrums but it\u2019s great to be having this success.\u201d Second overall, after a battle for fitness, crashes and a lack of hard racing, was a significant result for Thomas. However intense his disappointment, he hid it well as, 12 months after his own success, Bernal was feted in Paris. \u201cI can be proud and satisfied I\u2019ve done everything I could to try and be in the best shape,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were a lot of doubters. It\u2019s always nice to show what I can do and back it up. If someone else had won, it would be really disappointing, but Egan\u2019s won and it\u2019s amazing.\u201d Brailsford praised Thomas\u2019s resilience despite the setbacks in his title defence. \u201cGeraint\u2019s ridden really well here, considering that a lot wrote him off after the winter,\u201d he said. \u201cThis whole theory that he can\u2019t win after the first time \u2014 he deserves a lot of credit for getting himself in the shape he did. Having missed the racing he was supposed to have, he\u2019s done terrifically well. \u201cHe was very close to winning this. He just had that little block in the middle where he could have stepped up and he could have been right up there.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
