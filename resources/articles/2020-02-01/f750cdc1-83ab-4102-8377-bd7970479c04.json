The Elizabeth Tower has a footprint of 12 metres square (144 square metres), not 12 square metres as we said. This error was compounded when we converted to imperial; the footprint is 1,550 square feet, not 130 square feet as we stated (Bill to restore Big Ben tower rises to \u00a380m after asbestos discovered, 13 February, page 12). \u2022 Other recently corrected articles include: Wildfires are ruinous - so how to stop them happening in the first place?
