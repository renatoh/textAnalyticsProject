It's hard to get into a rhythm in one-day cricket, when you're bowling two overs, four overs and three overs at the end. I'm sure the more he bowls the better he'll get, and by the time the first Test comes around in Brisbane, I'm sure he'll be ready to go.\" South Africa kept their Champions Trophy hopes alive with a 78-run victory over Sri Lanka in Ahmedabad yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
