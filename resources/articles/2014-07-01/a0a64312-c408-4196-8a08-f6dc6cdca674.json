First Brussels, then Strasbourg. First Juncker, now Schulz. The German social democrat was not grinning but Martin Schulz could have been forgiven for gloating. The man who did so much to engineer Cameron's humiliation last Friday and push Jean-Claude Juncker into the top job in Brussels rubbed salt into the British prime minister's wounds on Tuesday. He took 409 of 612 valid votes in the new European parliament, at the first of three possible attempts, to take an unprecedented second successive term as speaker. Then he announced he and Juncker would be \"partners\" \u2013 a federalist double-act. When Juncker goes before the parliament on 16 July to be confirmed in his post, predicted Schulz, the Luxembourger will get as much support as he did on Tuesday. It was the first day of school for the class of 2014. In the grand circular parliament that occupies what looks like a disused plot in an industrial estate on the outskirts of the French frontier city of Strasbourg, there were queues everywhere \u2013 for a coffee, for the loo, to cast a vote (usually for Schulz). Juncker is bad enough for Cameron. But Juncker-Schulz? The proverbial euro-nightmare. But it was clear that Cameron's ordeal is far from over. Yes, the Luxembourg Christian democrat and the German social democrat are conniving to create a super-Grosse-Koalition on the German model to drive all those nasty Europhobes and sceptics back whence they came. There were plenty of the latter, too, bent on wrecking the parliament in which they were taking their seats. Father and daughter, Jean-Marie and Marine Le Pen, for example, winning last month's European election in France and now taking the fight to the proper enemy, l'Europe. And Cameron's other nemesis, Nigel Farage, gleefully applauding the rise of the Juncker-Schulz axis as an anti-Cameron and anti-Europe gift to English nationalists. His cohort included David Coburn, in brogues, kilt and tweeds, here for the first time from Edinburgh. \"It's interesting to be in the belly of the beast,\" he said. \"I can see how much is being wasted already.\" Coburn is that rarest of breeds, a Scot who won a seat north of the border for an English nationalist party. There were communists and fascists, \"pirates\" and Greens, former prime ministers and dozens of out-of-work eurocrats, taking their places for the next five years in what Schulz dubbed \"one of the greatest historic achievements of this continent. This parliament is unique.\" A chamber orchestra played Beethoven. Le Pen's lot remained seated as everyone, Tories included, rose for the Ode To Joy. The Farage crowd rose, too, but they turned their backs. Farage lined up his contingent of 24 outside by the flagpoles and marched them in. Had they gone to the other side of the building they could have cheerfully trooped in through the Winston Churchill Gate. But that would have meant missing the TV cameras. They opted for the front door. The \"march for freedom\" entailed Nigel walking out of the building, giving his MEPs a wee pep-talk in front of the TV cameras before walking back in again. \"Let's behave with dignity and enjoy it,\" he told them. \"When I first came here 15 years ago,\" said the man who used the despised European Parliament platform to build himself a political career in Britain, \", there were three of us walking in the door.\" It's a parliament like few before it: 186 parties or movements from 28 countries representing 507 million people. As Farage noted, up to 30% of the 751 MEPs are Eurosceptic or Europhobic, bent on wrecking Europe from the inside. \"It's a different parliament, a more exciting parliament,\" he said. It's also an increasingly powerful parliament. Not least, thanks to Schulz. Juncker's nomination last week was the first time that the EU's elected leaders had done the parliament's bidding in proposing a commission president. Things will never be the same again. Cats and cream sprung to mind as the whiskered Schulz tried not to gloat at the end of the most successful week in his political life. \"In addition to Juncker, Schulz is becoming president of the parliament,\" he said, speaking in English of himself in the third person. \"This is not a contribution for the enthusiasm of David Cameron \u2026 I can't change that now.\" The polyglot president's words might need to be translated from English into English \u2013 \"Cameron won't like this. Tough.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
