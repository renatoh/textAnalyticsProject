His meaning perhaps was that altruism is less powerful than necessity. Had the great Frenchman been at Peterhead last week, as the trawler fleet lay tied up in a forest of masts, he would have had to adjust, though not revise, his dictum. Over the gunwales came not sardines but cries for help of such power that they induced the Scottish Executive's first defeat in the young history of the Edinburgh Parliament. In 20 months the Parliament has set a number of precedents. For example, it meets at reasonable hours, evading Shaw's cynical conclusion, in his play Major Barbara, that 'alcohol enables Parliament to do at 11 at night what no sane person would do at 11 in the morning'. Last week the Edinburgh chamber saw another variation on the traditions of that 'other place' where in a tied vote the Speaker is expected to endorse the status quo. The presiding officer, Sir David Steel, used his casting vote to support an opposition motion. Since it had already been twice amended, Sir David interpreted the status quo as meaning what was by then clearly the will of the parliament. The Executive was incandescent. The motion said that Scotland's trawlermen should, in addition to the \u00a325 million decommissioning programme already on the table, be offered a tie-up compensation scheme to save stocks of immature haddock. Apart from MSPs whose constituencies are directly affected, there was a more general sympathy in the Parliament for the fishermen because of the disproportionate effect their difficulties are having in small communities. Four Liberal Democrats voted against the coalition. One who did not - Shetland MSP Tavish Scott - resigned as a junior Minister on Friday, having earlier told friends that constituency pressures were making his position untenable. Labour behaved with all the finesse of a street bully. It lashed out and blamed the presiding officer. First it tried to persuade him to change his mind. When that failed it leaked nasty remarks about him, even accusing him of plotting to subvert Tony Blair's visit to the Labour conference in Inverness. Their complaints are pathetic, like a football manager blaming the ref when half his team fails to show up. Responsibility for the mess lies with Labour in general and Parliament Minister Tom McCabe in particular. Observers say he has been going round 'like a bear with a sore head'. First Minister Henry McLeish has decided not to accept Parliament's advice. He has been accused of 'dumping democracy' but he is within his rights. Only statutory votes and financial resolutions are binding on the Executive. At Inverness there was wild talk of Labour abandoning the coalition and forming a minority administration. That may happen, but probably not yet. What we are seeing, in fact, is coalition politics of a kind with which other countries are familiar. The Executive will now have get down to some hard bargaining with the trawlermen's leaders. The Scottish Executive must approach the question of compensation very cautiously, not because the fishermen's case is inherently unjust but because of the precedent it might set. The Scottish countryside is closed by foot and mouth. The tourist industry is only one of numerous victims of the 'consequential' losses for which no compensation has been promised. If fishermen are given compensation because of economic inactivity, why should it not be given to others? And as Lib Dem rural affairs Minister Ross Finnie noted, what cuts will be needed in other programmes? Devolution has not transported us to Sugar Candy Mountain. Without the finance to nourish it, principle must languish: that is the truth Cantona so eloquently recognised when he talked darkly of sardines."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
