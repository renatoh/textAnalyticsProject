The eight-team professional football league conceived by World Wrestling Entertainment chairman Vince McMahon as an out-of-season competitor to the NFL appears to be done for good after workers were informed of the layoffs during an in-house conference call Friday. When it canceled the remainder of its 2020 season last month because of the coronavirus pandemic, the league\u2019s official statement said it was \u201ccommitted to playing a full season in 2021 and future years\u201d. The XFL played five games out of a planned 10-game schedule. It drew decent TV ratings early on and had deals with ESPN and Fox. But spring football is a difficult challenge, as the Alliance of American Football found out in 2019, not lasting a full season. NFL Network\u2019s Mike Garafolo reported the league will pay employees through Sunday. Shortly after Friday\u2019s announcement, the Dallas Cowboys signed cornerback Saivion Smith, who played for the XFL\u2019s Houston Roughnecks. The Roughnecks were the XFL\u2019s longe undefeated team when the league stopped playing in March. Smith led the University of Alabama with three interceptions in his only season in 2018. The Crimson Tide lost to Clemson in the College Football Playoff championship game. He signed with Jacksonville as an undrafted free agent last year but was waived before the season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
