Not since 1999, the year before Italy joined the championship, have Scotland held England to a single-figure margin on their turf. They had conceded an average of 39 points in their previous five Six Nations matches at Twickenham, conceding 40 in all except one. The Scotland coach, Andy Robinson, who was returning to his old stamping ground and would have felt a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at the end of the scrappy, tryless opening half, was asked after the defeat here whether he felt Scotland deserved the wooden spoon. Not wishing to tempt fate, he equivocated but the Scots have won only four of their past 24 games in the Six Nations. \"Everything will be decided on Saturday,\" Robinson said. \"I was really disappointed at losing. It was a huge effort by the players and hats off to them. They put their bodies on the line and we have to take that improvement into the Italy game. We need to give our supporters something to cheer about.\" England scored their try while the Scotland flanker John Barclay was in the sin\u2011bin after being penalised for playing the ball at a ruck under his own posts with his hands to prevent England from launching an attack. \"It was disappointing,\" Robinson said. \"When the score was 9-9, Nick Easter had done the same thing near his posts. I was told that as he had kicked the ball out of the scrum-half's hands with his foot, it was all right but John got a yellow for doing the same with his hand. I will be having a word with Paddy O'Brien [the International Rugby Board's referee manager] about that.\" Scotland are likely to be without the back\u2011row Kelly Brown for the Italy match. He was knocked out trying to tackle Matt Banahan and play was held up for five minutes while he was manoeuvred on to a stretcher. \"He is walking around and talking,\" Robinson said. \"We will follow the concussion protocol with him.\" The Scotland full-back Chris Paterson said it was the first time he had been involved in a close encounter at Twickenham. \"It showed our defence was better. It was a strange, unstructured game, good to watch I guess. It is another defeat and we have six days to regroup.\" Asked if he agreed with the claim that Scottish rugby is in terminal decline, he said: \"I cannot accept that. What today showed was that sport at international level is about very small margins. Sometimes things go your way and we have to make sure we do not end up with the wooden spoon.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
