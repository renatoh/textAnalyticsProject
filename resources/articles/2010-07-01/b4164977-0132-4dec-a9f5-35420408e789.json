Giving industry and business interests the reins on the Change4Life campaign is a recipe for disaster. Talk about giving a child the keys to the sweetshop! As the National Institute for Clinical Excellence has shown, controls on the formulation and marketing of foods are the most straightforward and cost-effective way to support healthy eating. They also provide the classic \"nudge\"' so extolled by Lansley and the government. Allowing business to pay for awareness campaigns instead of forcing them to provide healthier food does no such thing. In these straitened times, it is tempting to look elsewhere for funding to support public health, and the food industry is not short of money. We saw recently that the food lobby spent \u20ac1bn to ensure that traffic-light food labelling \u2013 the system consumers find most easy to understand \u2013 will not see the light of day. This is not an industry with consumer health at its core. Left to its own devices, this powerful lobby of vested interests will run rings round the government and continue to act in a way that is detrimental to public health. Alison Giles Chief executive, Our Life \u2022 It's no surprise that the government is looking to blame EU rules for not acting against food industry interests in the battle against obesity. In a key vote three weeks ago Conservative MEPs, who like to promote themselves as staunch defenders of Britain's right not to be ruled by Brussels, pushed for an EU ban on Britain developing its own food-labelling rules. The wholehearted backing of the food industry line by the European parliament's centre-right has certainly set back efforts to help consumers make a healthy choice. But to blame the EU for the Conservative party's capitulation to industry interests really does take the biscuit. Glenis Willmott Labour's leader in the European parliament \u2022 As long-time promoters of cross-sector action, we are right behind Andrew Lansley's message that finding solutions to lifestyle-related diseases is a collaborative effort between the public, private and civil society sectors, and individuals. He said, \"If we are to reverse the trends in obesity, the commercial sector needs to change their business practices, including how they promote their brands.\" This is precisely what the International Business Leaders Forum has been engaged with for more than a decade. We have been at the forefront of working with food and drinks companies to develop a comprehensive and voluntary corporate response to addressing chronic lifestyle-related diseases. Beginning with the IBLF's successful Healthy Eating Active Living (Heal) framework developed for the food industry in 2006, our industry-specific health and wellness frameworks showcase how core business skills and capacities can be used to enhance health, touching every aspect from strategy and governance to reformulating products and funding consumer activity programmes. The IBLF fully acknowledges the real commercial tensions companies face between growing sales volumes and addressing chronic health issues. However, our experience is that responsible businesses are willing and able to engage voluntarily with government and society at large in order to innovate and adapt their business models and thereby play their part in making our world more sustainable. Graham Baxter Acting CEO, International Business Leaders Forum \u2022 Felicity Lawrence (Nanny does know best, Andrew Lansley, 9 July) makes absolute sense. Office for National Statistics data shows that, at birth, people living in the least deprived areas can expect more than 12 additional years of life in good or fairly good health than those in the most deprived areas. In England, the proportion of children aged under 16 classed as overweight or obese has risen from 25% in 1995 to 30% in 2008. In Wales and Scotland in 2008 the proportions of overweight or obese children aged between two and 15 were very similar to the figures for England. How can Andrew Lansley seriously think that companies which make profits from selling products that contribute to this will support real efforts to improve diets? On this issue what is coming from the government is not the moral leadership that is needed. It is, after all, taxpayers who will pay for the treatment of the ill-health resulting from the inherent inequity of our system. There are ways (including social marketing) to achieve changes in behaviour, but this requires action from the government, it cannot be left to the food industry. Dr Stephen Battersby President, Chartered Institute of Environmental Health \u2022 As a primary school headteacher (now long retired), I was at the forefront of introducing free, nutritious and wholesome breakfasts at my school in Birmingham. The improvements we witnessed, academically and behaviourally, showed just how important good nutrition is. I am so appalled that Andrew Lansley should be so stupidly short-sighted and blinkered that I am emailing him with my views and I will continue to do so on a daily basis until he apologises and revises his views. I urge everyone else who feels as strongly to do likewise. Mike Collis Birmingham"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
