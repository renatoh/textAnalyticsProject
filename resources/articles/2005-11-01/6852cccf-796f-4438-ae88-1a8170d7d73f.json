Now has two goals in his past 17 England games, having not struck competitively since a brace at Euro 2004. But if he was never to score again he would still be an automatic choice because of his ability to frighten defences and win games. Found space and passes that set up Owen's disallowed effort after six minutes. Was unlucky to hit the post with a clever chip over Abbondanzieri and then not to get a penalty from a surging run minutes later. 9 - Man of the match Paul Robinson Made three excellent saves in opening 10 minutes to thwart Argentina's early onslaught, allowing England to go on and shade the first half. Had a wobble at club level recently, conceding goals in two of his past three games for Spurs, but will surely make his major tournament debut next summer. Made an outstanding late save. 7 Luke Young Looks better attacking than defending. The Charlton captain has already had the trauma of the 1-0 defeat in Northern Ireland and his seventh cap was his most questionable performance. Was caught out of position more than once and was mugged by Sorin to draw a booking before his substitution. Gary Neville will be welcomed back. 5 Rio Ferdinand Had to play well after receiving the nod ahead of Sol Campbell, but should have cleared Rodriguez's cross rather than offering a rather languid attempt that allowed Argentina's opener. Flashes of composure and distribution needed to be supported with more niggle and grunt. May be a case for allowing Campbell a chance. 6 John Terry Recent tabloid revelations and David Beckham's endorsement to succeed him have made it an interesting week. More pertinently, though, there have been questions over his club form as the defence he marshals has shipped goals. Backed off from Riquelme early on and failed to rule the back line in what was a concerning all-round England defensive display. 5 Wayne Bridge Had not played since 1-0 friendly defeat away to Spain just under a year ago. Should not be criticised too much for Argentina's opener when he was skinned by Rodriquez which allowed Crespo's goal as he has just returned to fitness. Will be glad to be back and should be on plane to Germany. 5 Ledley King Can he play the holding role against the very best? Did not always shield the defence and near the break there were two occasions when this allowed Argentina to threaten near the business end. After a lively display as King's replacement, Joe Cole may yet seriously feature in Germany. 5 David Beckham Exchanged a laugh and giggle with Sorin when his opposite number dropped him off the ball. Range of passing was evident early on with a diagonal to Rooney that set up England's first corner. And was his intelligent back header that set up Rooney. A memorable fiftieth appearance as skipper. 7 Frank Lampard A little anonymous and should have scored with a left foot strike after break. Is a constant threat, though, and dumping Riquelme after eight minutes showed he can kick. His standards are so high he will be disappointed and hardly deserved his booking. 6 Steven Gerrard Is he going the same way as Paul Scholes, whose move to the left began the fading of his international form? Gerrard is far more dynamic, though, and it was his classy pass that found Rooney when the striker hit the post. With Cole's arrival he was back where he should play - centrally. 7 Michael Owen Invaluable. Had the ball in the net after six minutes and then popped up defending yet another dangerous Riquelme corner that drew appreciation from his team-mates. Despite his quiet showing, was sharp enough to score twice at the death to improbably steal the game for England. Late show illustrated his enduring goalscoring class at the very highest level. 8 Substitutes J Cole: Had half an hour to show Sven what he had been missing when England went behind and was a danger. After recent international performances was unlucky to be dropped. 6 Paul Konchesky Welcome to the big league Paul. Winning his second cap when replacing Bridge, he by losing possession with his first touch. Then became far worse when he picked up space instead of Samuel to allow defender to score. 5 Peter Crouch Had nine minutes and got amongst them in the frenetic final stages.6 \u00b7 You can mail the Observer direct at sport@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
