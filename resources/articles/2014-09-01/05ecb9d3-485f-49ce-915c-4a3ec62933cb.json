Sam Allardyce, the visiting manager, branded the incident as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d. It occurred when Rooney chased back Stewart Downing 15 minutes into the second half. With the forward and Robin van Persie having scored for United before Diafra Sakho\u2019s 37th-minute header, Rooney took a hack at Downing near the centre circle. This caused the referee, Lee Mason, to show the 28-year-old a straight red, which was the sixth of his career and a first for the club since 2009. As the captain of United \u2013 and England \u2013 Rooney wanted to accept responsibility. \u201cIt was probably the right decision,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw the West Ham player making a counterattack and I tried to break up the play, but I just misjudged it.\u201d Rooney says he will not appeal. \u201cNo. I understand it,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew at the time that I misjudged it. It is a red card and I don\u2019t think it will benefit anyone to appeal against the decision.\u201d As a result, Rooney will not play any club football in October, missing next Sunday\u2019s visit of Everton, the trip to West Bromwich Albion on 20 October, and the home game with Chelsea six days later. With the next match Rooney can feature in being the Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium on 2 November, he said: \u201cThat\u2019s the most disappointing thing. Obviously we got away with it [against West Ham] by getting the win, but I am really gutted that I am going to be missing the next three games. It is hard to take and I am obviously gutted.\u201d Rooney accepts any criticism that his old temper may be flaring up. \u201cI expect people to say that, but at the end of the day, I was trying to break up the play,\u201d he said. Rooney apologised to the team in the dressing room after the match. \u201cYeah, of course I did. Everyone knew [I was in the wrong], so I am just grateful the lads were able to hold on,\u201d he said. Asked if he had spoken to Downing, Rooney said: \u201cNo. I haven\u2019t absolutely volleyed the lad. I have tried to trip him up and he got further away from me and that is why my leg is straighter than it should have been.\u201d Next month\u2019s Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia are a consolation. \u201cIt helps that the England games are coming up, but the training here is really good,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I just have to make sure I train well and be ready for when I come back.\u201d While Allardyce fumed about a late Kevin Nolan equaliser ruled out for offside, of Rooney\u2019s red card he said: \u201cIt was crazy and it\u2019s irresponsible. We all know that lads trip up players \u2013 but he gave him a bit of a swipe.\u201d Meanwhile, Louis van Gaal forgave Rooney. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to change,\u201d said the manager. \u201cHe just needed to do it in a more friendly manner. He said that to me afterwards.\u201d The length of Rooney\u2019s ban, however, was news to the United manager. \u201cThree games you think? OK,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a big miss, especially as I am thinking now he is playing at a good standard in his new role. And he likes to play there. When he gets three matches it means also that my captain is away. He is a very important person, especially in my vision, because not for nothing is he captain of this team.\u201d Van Gaal stated that Rooney is proving an admirable leader: \u201cHe is an example for the squad. That I saw in the USA [on tour] and when he came back he kept that and that\u2019s why I made him captain.\u201d The Dutchman is not concerned another red card may occur soon: \u201cNo. He came at once to me and said it was not his meaning to do it like that. I can say it to you because I have already said it to him. Otherwise I would not say it.\u201d Ander Herrera was taken off injured in the 74th minute. If the Spaniard does not recover for Everton\u2019s visit he will be a 10th player unavailable as Van Gaal stated there was no prospect of anyone coming back in time for next weekend. The victory over West Ham featured the full debuts of two 19-year-olds, Luke Shaw and Paddy McNair. Of the latter, playing his first match at senior level, Rooney said: \u201cIt won\u2019t get much tougher in terms of physical strength and aggression against him, but he dealt with it and we are all delighted with him. I saw the clearance he made at the end and I thought he was tremendous for us.\u201d While that was a fine header McNair made while running towards his own goal, Rooney added: \u201cThis is probably one of the bigger tests a young defender can face, up against a team putting in lots of crosses into the box, but he took it and stood up to it, especially in the second half.\u201d Rooney believes McNair\u2019s appearance \u2013 and the debut, as a late substitute, of the 21-year-old Tom Thorpe \u2013 shows United continue to give youth a chance. \u201cAlthough we let Tom Cleverley go on loan and Danny Welbeck go to Arsenal, we have brought in a young Manchester lad in Tyler Blackett who has played every game until today. The manager has brought young Paddy in and it has shown he isn\u2019t afraid to throw young players in.\u201d Man of the match Paddy McNair (Manchester United)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
