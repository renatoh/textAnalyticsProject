Instead, this is a well-functioning, gripping thriller that sets up a convincing world for its Deptford lothario Nelson \u201cNelly\u201d Rowe, then threatens to violently dismantle it, piece by piece. James is Nelly, a man-about-town who loves drinking and women, of whom there are several in his life, though none are yet wise to his philandering ways. Nelly lives a relatively charmed life in his neighbourhood, breezing around the houses and flats on his estate with a smile on his face for everyone. He\u2019s the kind of decent bloke who steps in at his local when a stroppy student refuses to take his spliff outside, who does his girlfriend\u2019s Avon-like round when she\u2019s too ill. There are signs that life might not be so peachy: the slug of whisky in his morning tea that shows he loves more than an afternoon pint, the temper that flares when things don\u2019t go his way in the pub. Though Nelly initially gives the impression that he could talk his way out of a paper bag, albeit one with a bottle in it, his happy-go-lucky facade falls away when the police march into his flat and arrest him on suspicion of abducting his estranged daughter. Save Me treads familiar ground in some respects \u2013 The Missing and Kiri both pivoted on the mystery of an abducted child \u2013 but there are clever layers that give it its own identity. The class conflict between students and locals in the pub is well handled and even funny, particularly in a karaoke scene, which turns the choice of Mumford &amp; Sons into a low-key declaration of war. It is smart, too, to have Suranne Jones\u2019s Claire (Nelly\u2019s ex and the mother of Jody, the missing girl) as a woman who lives a plummy middle-class life, with a swimming pool in the grounds of her massive house in Surbiton. You get the impression that Jones could act grief in her sleep, but she is impressively subtle here, opting for muted panic rather than hysteria. Their relationship adds yet another layer of intrigue. Given their differences, what were they doing together in the first place, and why did she warn police that the affable-seeming Nelly had a cruel streak? Who has made it look as if Nelly kidnapped his daughter, and where is she now? My money is on the husband, so far. It is always the husband somehow. There are parts that veer towards the cheesy \u2013 the all-walks-of-life estate scenes, the slow-mo tai chi, the bullying copper who sneers at Nelly. But the cast is excellent and the central mystery strong. When you\u2019ve got Stephen Graham as a pub regular who almost fades into the background, it\u2019s obvious that his character will have something more to do with it. But the entire cast pulls its weight, from Susan Lynch as the barmaid to Kerry Godliman as the spurned ex. All episodes \u201cdrop\u201d online at once, though I suspect it will be more rewarding to let the story unravel week by week, the old-fashioned way, rather than gorging to get to the end. It\u2019s still bringing in the viewers, but as Benidorm (ITV) kicks off its 10th series, it is now limping towards the sun loungers rather than taking a running jump into the pool. Manageress Joyce is getting married to Monty, whose wedding-planning skills make him an ideal candidate for Don\u2019t Tell the Bride. He plans to tie the knot on a boat, but Joyce gets seasick, and they end up stranded on Peacock Island, with flamboyant and hopefully just plain buoyant Kenneth their only hope of rescue. You could always see the jokes coming from the bar on Benidorm, but this time they are not so much signposted as shouted in increasingly loud English, as if to a Spanish person who doesn\u2019t speak the language. Benidorm was once a better sitcom than it was given credit for, but its glory days have long since fallen away. This episode was a slog, because, with all the good will in the world, it seemed as if the writers had forgotten to pack the jokes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
