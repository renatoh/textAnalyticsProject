They believed their information was credible and decided they had to intercept them. This was not the raid in London's Forest Gate, where police feared there might be a chemical device. It was Operation Icebolt, where 150 officers staged simultaneous raids on kebab and pizza shops and homes across the north-east of England in January 2002. Six men were arrested and each of the premises was searched by officers in white paper suits. The raids were front page news and raised inevitable questions about the threat posed by terrorists within the UK. But within days all the men were freed without charge. They had been detained on the evidence of an informant: his evidence turned out to be wrong. Tactics Yesterday anti-terror investigators were again having to defend their tactics after two men arrested in the Forest Gate operation in east London were released without charge. While police insist these kinds of raids are necessary to prevent another July 7, many of the innocent men and women caught up in them have had their lives changed, or lost their businesses. One of them is Omar Mohammed, a 46-year-old Jordanian living in Coulby Newham, Middlesbrough, with his English wife Tina and their three children when police came to the door asking if there was \"an Arab living in the house\". \"Within 10 minutes I was arrested but they did not tell me what for for 48 hours,\" said Mr Mohammed, in his first interview. \"Eventually they said they had information that we imported suicide jackets, grenades, rockets, machine guns. We were supposed to have hidden them in England and then shipped them back to Hamas and Hizbullah. My answer was, why would we bring them here? It's very difficult to get such things into this country, never mind get them out and anyway, Hamas and Hizbullah can make their own suicide vests. I said to them, you will never find a toy gun for my kids, never mind a real one in my house.\" Mrs Mohammed said: \"They strip-searched my son Jamie, who was 14, and patted down my daughter, who has special needs. She had been scribbling on a piece of junk mail, and it was just squiggles, and they found it and said it was Arabic code. We had a DIY bag with hammers and stuff in it and they said that was bombmaking equipment.\" Their case is not unique. According to the Home Office, up to 30 September 2005, 895 people have been arrested under the Terrorism Act 2000; of those 23 have been convicted of terrorism offences. Aamer Anwar, a Scottish human rights lawyer who has represented a number of those arrested, said: \"You have got Muslims being picked on the basis of single informant information. Often, informants are people who are facing threats of deportation or jail or are being given financial assistance. The pressure they put informers under produces misinformation and they will often tell them what they want to hear to stay in the country or stay out of jail. And the real bombers will walk right under their noses.\" But in the wake of the July 7 attacks in central London and other foiled plots, security officials say they have never before faced such a potentially dangerous, hidden threat, and a fear, bordering on expectation, that terrorists will stage another successful attack on Britain. They describe an \"unprecedented level of operational intensity\" by MI5 and anti-terrorist police. One official, asked if he expects more Britons to be murdered soon, dropped his eyes and head, paused, then quietly said: \"Yes.\" According to counter-terrorism officials, MI5 knows of more than 1,000 \"primary investigative targets\" - individuals they believe are intent on carrying out an attack. That compares with about 250 in September 2001. John Reid, the home secretary, said last month that the security services are aware of 20 conspiracies at any one time. Counter-terrorism officials say there are more. Some officials admit the level of intelligence is still poor, and relatively bad relations with sections of the Muslim community are a factor. Muslim leaders point to the difference between those who are strident in their political Islam but would never cross over into violence, and those who are prepared to kill. The knowledge that potential terrorists are out there planning attacks makes it harder for the security and intelligence agencies to ignore information passed to them. The potential risk of ignoring it, or waiting for corroboration, has to balanced against the risk of a backlash from the Muslim community. Targeted However, some officials, speaking without authorisation, admit that the innocent are sometimes targeted. One was Karen Serir, who was three months pregnant when she was arrested with her husband Ali four years ago. Mrs Serir was arrested in an operation to disrupt an alleged plot to bomb Edinburgh's Hogmanay celebrations. Her husband, an Algerian asylum seeker, was supposed to have been part of a ring of men allegedly linked to al-Qaida. Seven were charged on Christmas Eve under the Terrorism Act 2000 but the charges were later dropped. Mrs Serir was released after 36 hours in custody and her husband, a chef, was detained by immigration authorities for four months before being released on bail: he is no longer allowed to work. The Hogmanay party went ahead with police saying they had no reports suggesting a \"specific\" threat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
