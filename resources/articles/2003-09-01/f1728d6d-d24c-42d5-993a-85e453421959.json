He confesses to having a 'garage full of cookery gadgets which have not stood the test of time'. There is the George Foreman grill, the pizza oven, the breadmaker and several toasted sandwich makers. Another cupboard is full of hi-tech gadgets and time savers which he has not had time to learn how to use. This explains his reputation within the company for buying the latest gizmos and failing to get them to work. Text messaging has proved beyond him and he has tried 3G - the next generation of mobile phones, which handle data as well as voice - but could not work out how to use it. 'For a product that is so small and compact, the instruction book is enormous. When I took out this six-inch thick book, I assumed it was one of these that is in 18 different languages and you have to search for the English bit. But it was actually all in English.' If he could only persuade the rest of us to fill our homes with a similar assortment of unused gadgets, his job might be a lot easier. Clare's challenge is to keep sales at his stores, which include The Link and PC World as well as the more traditional Currys and Dixons chains, growing by enough to please demanding investors. When prices of practically all that he sells fall every year, and everyone from Argos to Asda reckons they can do it better and cheaper, it is a constant battle. Clare had some reasonable news for the City last week, telling shareholders that sales in the key British stores held steady at last year's level over the past four months. It was a creditable perfor mance given that last year's World Cup, poor weather and Golden Jubilee celebrations combined to produce a bumper summer. However, Clare is not satisfied. The trading statement was just 'OK'. At Dixons, Christmas is the key trading period. 'I will not be happy that the UK business is where I want it to be unless I can say similar things after Christmas.' He is confident that progress is being made. Dixons, whose expensive - and small - high street stores have made it the weakest part of the group, is making progress with its new XL format. Apart from Selfridges, XL is the largest store in Birmingham's new Bullring development, which opened last week. He also believes Currys has found a way forward and that PC World still has a lot of growth potential. 'If anything, the Link [its mobile phone retailer] is now the one which is the most mature.' But it will take more than one good set of trading figures and a confident Clare to convince the City that Dixons is on the mend. First, there is concern over the outlook for retail sales as the remortgaging boom, which was filling our wallets last year, tails off and interest rate rises loom. Clare has taken a rather contrary stance on that this year. In January he was gloomy when everyone else was becoming more optimistic. Then, in June, he predicted an improving trend when others were worried about a slide. The AGM trading statement at least partly vindicates his stance. Now, he thinks that things should be all right provided there is no big hike in interest rates. The second issue, extended warranties, is an even bigger concern. The Competition Commission is just concluding an investigation into these contracts, which Dixons promotes with practically everything it sells, and the betting is that there will be big changes. It has already outlined two possible remedies. The first involves giving customers a lot more information, includ ing repair costs and rate of breakdown, before they buy a warranty. The second would prevent retailers from selling extended warranties until a specified period - say 28 days - after the product was sold. The latter would be particularly bad news for Dixons. While only 7 per cent of its sales arise from these contracts, analysts estimate that they account for up to half its profits. Anything that makes them harder to sell will make these profits harder to earn. But Clare contends that the changes would also be bad for customers, many of whom, it seems, are as technophobic as Clare himself. Unlike traditional manufacturers' warranties, Dixons' service contracts cover setting up the product, connecting it and getting it working, none of which would be available if customers had to wait 28 days to buy the warranty, he says. 'A significant number of customers contact us immediately after buying,' he adds. 'And 40 per cent contact us within the first month.' But this is the third investigation into warranties that Clare has had to defend - the previous two, by the Office of Fair Trading, resulted in some tightening of procedures - in the 16 years since he joined the company. He has spent the past nine as chief executive. Having just turned 53, is he not thinking of new challenges rather than staying in a job that seems to require constant reinvention of the wheel? This suggestion makes Clare more animated than any other topic: 'Retail is not a business that bores you. It is an extremely exciting market place and a great job. I will do it for as long as the energy is there and the shareholders want me to.' That is also a riposte to those who suggest that Clare is not a 'real retailer' in the mould of Stanley Kalms, who built the business from a camera store and has just stepped up from chairman to the honorary title of president. Indeed, Clare is positively effusive about his love for retail, so much so that he confesses to enjoying doing the weekly food shop ('I choose a different supermarket every week'), wandering around fashion stores and, of course, rivals' stores as well as regularly visiting between 40 and 50 of his own stores every month. 'You have to see some stores every week,' he said. 'Otherwise, things can change so quickly you do not see what is happening. You start to believe the bullshit you get from the centre.' He is famous for his attention to the detail of sales figures: a screen on his desk shows exactly what is selling, where and for how much; he pores over sales reports at midnight. Clare is unapologetic. 'Retail is that sort of business. It is a very operational business.' And, he says, he is very good with figures, able to analyse and understand them quickly. Not, however, thanks to his maths degree from Edinburgh. 'In four years of studying, I never used a number.' Nor, in his final year specialising in oceanography and fluid dynamics, did he ever see the sea. 'No paddling,' he insists. It was all theory. He read maths because he could and he wanted to get a degree. Armed with it, he immediately sought a job in industry, was offered six and accepted Mars 'because they offered me \u00a320 than anyone else'. He made his mark selling the eponymous bars round the grocers in Bradford and quickly climbed the ladder, with postings in Switzerland, Sweden and Denmark before he joined Ladbrokes. Three years later a headhunter asked if he would consider becoming marketing director of Dixons. He did not hesitate and has been with the company ever since. Now that the summer trading statement is out of the way, Clare is buckling down and thinking of Christmas. Likely bestsellers have already been marked out: camera phones plus flat screen and plasma televisions. But the only present Clare wants is for us to buy enough of them to convince everyone that Dixons is once more on the right track.
