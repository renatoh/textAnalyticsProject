But as much as he and England want to win, there is no doubt that every player who will be involved in the Ashes squad has next month's first Test in Brisbane uppermost in their minds. Certainly on November 23, whatever happens in the ICC Trophy, Harmison intends to be at peak fitness. \"I'd be lying if I said it wasn't,\" he said. \"I'm not going to sit here and talk bullshit about how we haven't got one eye on the Ashes, because we have. But we are here to win a competition, and whoever loses on Saturday goes home. The best thing we can do is to go on and win the trophy after beating Australia on Saturday.\" Both sides lost their opening match; England by four wickets against India when they were bowled out for 125, and Australia by 10 runs in Mumbai against West Indies. The advantages, however marginal, are with England; they have already played in Jaipur while Australia have had to make a quick turn around. Should England win then they may be more inclined to project success on to the Ashes series, although Harmison would have no truck with any such suggestion. \"This is a one-off occasion with no relevance to the Ashes,\" he said. \"I imagine 15-20% of the players here will not be involved in the first Test in Brisbane.\" Ian Chappell, the pundit and former Australia captain, has singled out the quick bowler as the key to England retaining the Ashes, as well as suggesting that Andrew Flintoff has the captaincy because he knows exactly how to get the best out of the Ashington-born fast bowler, who in the past has sometimes not been the happiest of tourists. Certainly during the first week of the ICC Trophy it has been the fast bowlers who have being doing the most damage, predominantly because of the inconsistent bounce. Harmison took two for 34 against India in six overs even though his opening over included three wides and went for 20, although it did include a wicket. \"I soon realised I had to hit the deck hard rather than try to swing it,\" he said. \"You have to bowl as straight as you possibly can and the ball I got Sachin [Tendulkar] out with would have lifted waist high on a true pitch. It hit him on top of the ankle.\" That first over apart, Harmison felt he bowled well. If he did \"beat himself up\" a little it was because he felt he had tried too hard at the start, straining for extra pace. \"I lost a bit of focus and bearing in mind I have more experience than some of the others, I should have reined it in a little bit rather than go gung-ho and all guns blazing to try and blast them out from ball one. But we didn't have much room to play with and we needed early wickets.\" Chris Gayle, meanwhile, has been fined 30% of his match fee for breaching the ICC's code of conduct during Wednesday's victory over Australia. The West Indies opener, who was involved in a number of verbal clashes with Michael Clarke, was found guilty of failing to \"conduct play within the spirit of the game\" by the match referee Mike Procter. Clarke was found not guilty of the same charge. \"What started off as banter between the two players got out of hand and Chris Gayle went over the top in his reactions,\" Procter said. \"We do not want robots on the field and we want to ensure players play with enthusiasm and passion. We saw a great deal of that during an excellent match but there is a line between what is acceptable and what is not and Chris crossed it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
