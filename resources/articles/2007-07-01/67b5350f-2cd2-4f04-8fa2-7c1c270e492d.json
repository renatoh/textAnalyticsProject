Me and my brothers' favourite was a blue and white VW camper van with CND stickers on the back window. My dad had re-upholstered the interior of the van with cushions but he never got round to attaching them to the wooden bench seats. In those days, we didn't bother with seatbelts in the back, so each time the van turned a corner the cushions would slide off the seats and the three of us kids would be hurled against the opposite side of the van. Dad would play tapes on the van's stereo and we would stand up and dance in the back. He played Jimi Hendrix, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, the Rolling Stones, all of which we loved, but our favourite song - the one we demanded over and over - was by Fleetwood Mac and was known to us as the Screaming Song. In my memory, the song is at least 15 minutes of bluesy rock, punctuated at heart-stopping intervals with shrill screams. The Fleetwood Mac track is, I have subsequently discovered, called Not That Funny and is on a live album from 1980. Listening to it again 25 years later, it transpires that the song does have lyrics and the screaming section is only a two-minute guitar solo with about seven screams. We must have demanded that Dad play this section over and over again because the rest of the song had entirely faded from my mind. For the safety of your kids and your own sanity, please do not attempt to re-enact the above scenario. Rowena Macdonald We love to eat: Anna's Mum's treacle buns Ingredients 750g plain flour 1 level teaspoon bicarbonate of soda 1 level teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon of salt 2 tablespoons caster sugar 200g raisins 100g butter 1 medium egg 2 1/2 tablespoons black treacle buttermilk - as needed Preheat the oven to 230C, gas mark 8 and dust two baking trays with flour. Sift the dry ingredients into a bowl. Rub in the butter with your fingertips. Make a well in the dry ingredients and add the egg and the treacle. Mix in enough buttermilk to make a firm dough. Knead the dough a little and then pat into a round about 2cm thick. Cut it into rounds with a 5cm-diameter pastry cutter. Gather up the scraps, press them together lightly and pat out to the same thickness as before. Cut as many rounds as the mixture will yield. Place on baking sheets and then bake for 15 minutes, until well risen and brown. The buns are best served warm, split and spread with butter and accompanied with a strong cup of tea. This was the recipe I loved to make with my mum when I was little and it's something we'll both still make as \"the world is OK\" comfort food. I was gradually allowed more responsibility as I grew, from licking the bowl to rubbing in the butter to adding the raisins to at last doing the kneading. My friends and colleagues get very excited when I bake a batch now; even they find a bun and hot cup of tea comforting on a wintry afternoon.
