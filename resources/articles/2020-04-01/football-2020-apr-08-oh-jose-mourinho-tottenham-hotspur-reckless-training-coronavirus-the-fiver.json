How could you be so reckless?", "bodyText": "THE SORRY ONE The art of deception was perfected by nobody knows but Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has been pretty good at it down the years. Back in the 2005 Big Cup he famously turned a laundry basket into a Trojan horse, albeit one that was smuggled into his own team\u2019s dressing room rather than into the enemy camp, jumping out and slaughtering unsuspecting Bayern Munich players not being an option that even he was willing to consider. Credit where it\u2019s due. Before that, and very many times since that, Mourinho has expertly used interviews to cover up lame performances, sending unsuspecting hacks on wild goose chase after wild goose chase by talking pure, honed bull. But while he may spew a load of old pony, he\u2019s got much more than one trick. So The Fiver couldn\u2019t help but wonder what the Portuguese maestro was up to when footage emerged yesterday of him training in a north London park with three players from The People\u2019s Tottenham Hotspur in defiance of the government-ordered lockdown. Imagine our surprise when it turned out that he was doing exactly as it seemed! Oh Jos\u00e9! Oh The People\u2019s Tottenham Hotspur! How could you be so reckless? Whither your cunning? Clad in the same training clobber he has been wearing since arriving at Her Majesty\u2019s White Hart Lane last November \u2013 a purple outfit suggestive of The Joker, Mourinho was pictured putting Tanguy Ndombele through his paces in Hadley Common, Barnet, while Ryan Sessegnon and Davinson S\u00e1nchez ran around nearby. It is not clear how many of those players could be described as key workers at the best of times, but in these days of coronavirus woe, they certainly had no business being out together and, according to the camera angle at least, in worryingly close proximity to each other. It looked like these representatives of The People\u2019s Tottenham Hotspur were being a public menace. So what did the club have to say for themselves? Or did they ask tax payers to provide an answer on their behalf? \u201cAll of our players have been reminded to respect social distancing when exercising outdoors,\u201d wibbled the club in a statement that might have been written by a repurposed chimney sweep for all The Fiver knows. A short time later, Mourinho said: \u201cI accept my actions were not in line with government protocol and we must only have contact with members of our household. It is vital we all play our part and follow government advice in order to support our heroes in the NHS and save lives.\u201d No spin, no grasping for loopholes, just a frank admission that he made a mistake. What if Joe Lewis, TPTH\u2019s billionaire owner, took inspiration from this version of Mourinho? QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cBecause there was no hospital in Bambali they had to take him to the next village to see if they could save his life. But it was not the case\u201d \u2013 Sadio Man\u00e9 tells Ed Aarons why his father\u2019s death inspired him to build and fund a hospital in his homeland of Senegal.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cMy least favourite game? 17th April 2004. Bolton 2 Tottenham 0. My Missus and I, Tottenham Season Ticket Holders, had recently moved to Edinburgh. We had spent the previous afternoon on the sauce in the lovely fishing village of Crail in Fife. We could have spent the weekend there but we had tickets to see our lads play at Bolton. We set off at 9am and arrived in good time for kick off. It was the tail end of the Pleat caretaker era and in the first half we were shocking. I suggested to my missus that he should line the lads up in front of us away fans and let us do the half time team talk. Phil Brown was obviously listening. Anyway in the second half we were worse so we did something we never did. Left early \u2013 only to find we were blocked into the car park and could not get out (till an hour after the final whistle it turned out). When we did eventually get home our season ticket renewals were waiting for us. Of course we did one last time. Since then we\u2019ve only been out of the top five once. Bah!\u201d \u2013 Jack Mignall. \u201cOn May 12, 1996, my future wife and I visited the derelict Aarhus Stadion to see our local team squander the chance to go top in the Danish Superliga and on to win the first championship in 10 years. After going 0-1 down to visiting league leaders Br\u00f8ndby IF, Aarhus GF staged an epic comeback. Up 3-1 with 16 minutes to go, the slide into mediocrity began for Aarhus GF. First a young Ebbe Sand scored with 11 minutes to go and then, as ordinary time was expiring, visiting goalie Mogens Krogh scored on a second-chance header following a corner (heartbreak happens at 2:43 in this video). Aarhus GF never recovered, the season petering out. A few years later, the club was relegated and although it has been promoted again (before another sequence of relegation-promotion) the wait for another championship goes on 24 years later\u201d \u2013 Lars Esbjerg. \u201cAm I the only one wondering why The Fiver has stopped predicting scores for the minute by minute coverage? It could improve the stats\u201d \u2013 Johnny Mac. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport.
