The final is currently tipped to be between the right\u2019s Fran\u00e7ois Fillon and the far-right\u2019s Marine Le Pen. The French Socialist party, alongside other associated micro-parties, will hold an open primary race to choose its presidential candidate on 22 and 29 January and candidates have until 15 December to declare. But other candidates from the across the left have already announced they will run independently. Candidates from the hard-left to the centre-left could now include: Manuel Valls Hollande\u2019s prime minister and once his most loyal ally, Manuel Valls, has not yet announced if he will run in the Socialist primary race. Tough on law and order and a pro-business reformist from the right of the Socialist party, the 54-year-old is a little more popular with the general public than Hollande, but he is at odds with some of the left. He took only 5% of the vote in the last Socialist primary race in 2011. Arnaud Montebourg Arnaud Montebourg has already declared he will run in the Socialist primary race. Hollande\u2019s former economy minister is firmly on the left of the party and lost his cabinet position in 2014 after denouncing Hollande\u2019s pro-business shift. The former lawyer, who after leaving government did a management course at business school, says he favours a strong state to protect France\u2019s industry from \u201cforeign interests\u201d. Beno\u00eet Hamon The leftwing MP for Yveslines, outside Paris, has already declared to run in the Socialist primary race. Beno\u00eet Hanonserved twice as a minister under Hollande. But, as education minister, the 49-year-old quit the government in protest at pro-business reforms in 2014. Emmanuel Macron A rebellious former economy minister and former protege of Hollande, he has launched a maverick, outsider bid for the presidency, promising to lead a people\u2019s \u201cdemocratic revolution\u201d against a \u201cvacuous\u201d political system. The former investment banker, 38, who was unknown to the French public until two years ago, is not a member of a political party and has never run for elected office. He describes himself as coming from the left but wants to unite the left and right on a centrist ticket. Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon The charismatic firebrand is running on a radical left ticket and last week won the backing of the Communist party. A one-time Trotskyist and former teacher, he spent 30 years in the Socialist party, where he served as a minister and was once the youngest ever senator. He quit in 2008, arguing the party wasn\u2019t properly leftwing. A former Socialist minister, he has emerged as the tub-thumping philosopher-leader of the radical left. He won 11% of the vote in the first round of the 2012 presidential election. Christiane Taubira Christiane Taubira, Hollande\u2019s former justice minister and a well-established political figure from Cayenne in French Guiana, hasn\u2019t commented on whether or not she will run in the primary but a petition calling on her to do so currently has 70,000 signatures. The 64-year-old, who was an important voice on the left of Hollande\u2019s government, quit after differences over his security measures after Paris\u2019s terrorist attacks. As a minister, she often faced racist taunts from far-right sympathisers: at one rally, children waved bananas at her. A municipal election candidate for the far-right Front National was forced to withdraw in 2013 after likening her to a monkey on Facebook. She later told Lib\u00e9ration that racist attacks \u201cwere an attack on the heart of the republic\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
