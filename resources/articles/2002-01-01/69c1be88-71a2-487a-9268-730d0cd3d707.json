The service, which attracted the unwanted scrutiny of the big five recording companies after becoming hugely popular with internet users, is testing a members' service with 20,000 volunteers. The muted relaunch is the first step towards turning Napster, founded by college drop-out Shawn Fanning, into a legitimate business. Napster was forced into a hiatus to comply with a court order in July last year to remove all copyrighted material from its service. Napster, the most prominent of the free file-sharing services, had become a focus for fear among the music companies that their business could be severely damaged by downloading from the internet. Before being shut down, Napster had attracted 85m registered users downloading as many as 3bn songs a month. More than 2m volunteers came forward for the trial. The pilot service will initially offer 100,000 songs from independent labels including Beggars Banquet and Matador. A full members' service is planned for the end of March and talks to license music from the five big recording companies are continuing. The five have indicated that they would be willing to provide material to Napster if it is a legitimate, copyright-respecting service. The test service will be free for volunteers but the plan for the full relaunch is to charge between $5 and $10 a month, allowing the user to download 50 songs. In a painfully long process, Napster has been settling legal cases with individual artists including heavy metal band Metallica as well as a number of independent labels. Konrad Hilbers, Napster chief executive, said the pilot was to \"show the record companies that the technology works and the downloads are secure\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
