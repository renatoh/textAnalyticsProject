I would suggest that all the dungeons and dragons IT geeks consider doing likewise.\" I'd suggest they don't. Go to Cromer instead. 17th over: England 61-1 (Trescothick 17, Butcher 19) One four off the Kallis over, when the free-scoring Trescothick drives his full-length delivery for four. 18th over: England 65-1 (Trescothick 21, Butcher 19) Trescothick's motoring now, scoring the only runs of the Hall over with a boundary driven forward of point, [I'm told]. \"Well now if Julian King wants to talk about fine examples of TV, then look no further than The Flashing Blade,\" declares Jules.\"It used to be on some Saturday morning kids show, the name of which totally escapes me. Assistance please fellow over-by-over readers...?\" 19th over: England 74-1 (Trescothick 21, Butcher 27) Two quick fours for Butcher, the first the result of perfect timing, the second - which just evades the slips - owing a little to Lady Luck. \"I read your commentary on the 15th over a little too quickly and thought for a second Butcher had knocked Sean Ingle through mid off for suggesting such a dodgy analogy,\" writes Jonathan Betts. Fitting punishment in my book, Jonathan, but sadly not. AT ABOUT 4.30PM, THE GREMLINS STRUCK AGAIN. HUMBLE APOLOGIES, READERS, IT WAS OUT OF OUR HANDS Action you missed while the site crashed In the 20th over, moments before those gremlins reappeared, WICKET!! Butcher, b Hall, 32 (England 78-2) It swung late, pitched on, and Butcher was beaten all ends up for pace. Graham Thorpe arrived, and Ronnie Corbett popped up on screen in the VIP box, sporting a ruddy, farm-hand complexion. At the time of writing/wrapping up, and misguidedly thinking that this time the page will actually save and launch this time, England are 124-2. Well, it did go pear-shaped again... Trescothick and Thorpe were offered the light, Trescothick and Thorpe took the light, Trescothick and Thorpe trooped off and England finished the second day on 165-2. Phew! ALSO, A SPACE-FILLING SELECTION OF EMAILS YOU SENT IN WHILE ALL THAT WAS GOING ON, NONE OF WHICH SEEM RELEVANT NOW \"Have the gremlins struck again, or have the techies gone on strike after being told that Buffy is pants? The BBC are three overs, one wicket and countless runs ahead of you in your commentary. Gah!\" Gah! indeed, Chris Lancaster, we're blaming to square-headed bods. \"Can I suggest that all these people who use computers to email you stop caricaturing people who work in IT as D&amp;D playing geeks,\" suggests Anton Lawrence, a non-D&amp;D-playing, non- geek who just happens to work in IT systems support at Reading University. \"Who knows, email systems all over the UK may start to go down, as IT people decide to increase their chances of getting on the site... Brouhahahahahaha and then we can rule the world!\" \"Enjoying your tea break, Nick?\" asks Will Norman, making light of our woes. \"Where the f*** have you got to THIS time?!\" growls Kristian Petterson, who then makes a very good point. \"Surely the whole point of 'fixing' something is that, thereafter, it works. Not, to use the present situation as an example, to leave it just as useless as it was prior to the f***ing 'fix'.Sort yourselves out, eh - chop, chop.\" And that is pretty much that. You really do deserve better."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
