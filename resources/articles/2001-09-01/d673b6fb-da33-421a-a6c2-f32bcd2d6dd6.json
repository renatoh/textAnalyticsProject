In the cold light of day, Zoff deserved acclaim, not blame, for even guiding Italy to within touching distance of their first significant international trophy since the 1982 World Cup. Later on his achievement was recognised when he was voted the best manager on the planet by the esteemed magazine World Soccer. But Zoff, consumed by feelings of failure and embittered by criticism, could see no glory in having the silver ripped from his team's grasp by France. Naturally, the whole of Italy was miserable. 'I'm destroyed,' blubbed Alessandro Del Piero. 'Our bitterness is too great.' The antidote to all that pain has taken the form of a diminutive man, an ageing coach, who just happens to be the most decorated, and one of the most charismatic, leaders in the history of calcio. One summer on from the agony that Zoff walked away from, Giovanni Trapattoni has helped to put the feelgood factor back into Italian football. They are on course to become the first European team to book their ticket to Japan and South Korea. Liam Brady, who played under Trapattoni and alongside Zoff in the great Juventus team of the early 1980s, points to a key distinction between the two: 'The difference between Dino and Trap is that Dino seemed to transmit that he suffered his job, whereas Trap enjoys his job. Zoff is very tactically aware and did very well in the European Championship, but managing Italy always seemed to be a burden to him. With Trapattoni, although the pressure is great he seems to take pleasure in it as well. The players appreciate that. He's probably brought fun to it and a bit more passion.' Combine Sir Alex Ferguson with Bobby Robson and you get an idea of how Trapattoni is perceived in his homeland. He is respected for being a serial winner, whose haul of 20 trophies from a career in club management that spans more than a quarter of a century stands like a monument. 'Life, he announces, 'is like a competition. That is what keeps me motivated. What I've done in the past are all beautiful memories, but the most important thing in life is tomorrow, the future, the unknown.' At 62, he is as vivacious as ever. Super confident, master tactician, inspired conjurer of team spirit, Trapattoni has taken the squad of players Zoff built and simply encouraged them to do what they do best. Enforcing a powerful camaraderie is one of Trapattoni's strengths. Says Brady: 'When I was at Juventus probably half his team was in the Italian national side and I was very aware that there were no favourites, no stars, no prima donnas. The team came first and the players responded to that. He's always been good with the lesser-known players, picking the right ones to blend with the stars. 'In my career probably two or three coaches had that talent and expertise to be able to handle a group of stars. When, later on, I was at Inter Milan the team was full of stars and the coach couldn't get a grip. Trapattoni arrived there a year after I left and before long he'd won the championship with a record number of points even though he had more or less the same players at his disposal.' The atmosphere around his current Italy squad is as positive as anyone can remember. Thanks to his extrovert character the critics have been tamed. And thanks to results, the Azzurri have salvaged the reputation of a nation also licking their wounds over last season's mass malfunction in European club competitions. Hav ing been force-fed humble pie by the collective failure of the giants from Milan, Rome and Turin, Italy's emphatic qualification campaign tastes sweet. Glowing headlines whooped with joy - 'Everybody loves Trapattoni's Italy!' - and calcio retrieved its confidence. In fairness, they were lucky to have been placed in a group so pleasantly negotiable that you wonder whether Trapattoni skipped through a field of four-leaf clover on the morning of the draw. Italy's closest challengers, Romania, are talented but in transition, having bid farewell to three legends - midfield maestro Gheorghe Hagi, and defenders Gheorghe Popescu and Dan Petrescu - whose retirement was bound to set the team back for a while. Italy beat Romania home and away, scoring five and conceding none. The squad remain based on the key players from Euro 2000, with one notable addition. The prolific Christian Vieri, recovered from the dreadful thigh injury that kept him out of action for nine months, has made a welcome return to provide the option of a potent target man up front. The \u00a330 million Internazionale spearhead, who feared his career was over when he was struck down with fibrosis, has rediscovered his zest for scoring. He ended last season with 18 goals from 27 games and began this with two strikes in Inter's opening game in Serie A. His stamina, he says, feels good again. The missing link from Euro 2000 should be a vital force in World Cup 2002. Italy being Italy and Trapattoni being Trapattoni, defence comes first, and the towering barrier comprising Paolo Maldini, Fabio Cannavaro and Alessandro Nesta remains intact. On such stable foundations the creative players have freedom to express themselves. A reborn Del Piero contests the playmaker role with golden boy Francesco Totti. It is not an easy choice. 'From the very beginning of my time with the Azzurri, Totti was a key player. Now he is essential,' noted Trap after Roma's inspirational son took on the role of his country's matchwinner in Georgia. 'I don't like playing a crucial match without him.' With Totti struggling for fitness in the build-up to the Lithuania game, Trapattoni called upon Fabio Liverani as cover. The Perugia kingpin, hotly coveted by Juventus for some time now, made history when he won his first cap in a friendly last April as the first black player to represent Italy. The son of a Somalian mother and an Italian father, he excelled and has a strong chance of working his way into the World Cup 22. The captain, Maldini, who is set to hang up his international boots at the end of this season, believes Trapattoni is pushing so many right buttons his dream of ending an outstanding international career with a World Cup medal is not mere fantasy. Belief is growing all the time. 'Trapattoni has bought three things: wisdom, enthusiasm and obviously his knowledge of the game,' says Maldini. 'With this squad, it's not acceptable to be ordinary. There are two teams at our level: Argentina and France. The others, for now, are a little bit below.' Interestingly, Argentina are the only team to have beaten Italy since Trapattoni's appointment, in a friendly. As for France, they remain a b\u00eate noire after the Euro 2000 final. Their young-at-heart coach, who described the past 10 months guiding Italy through Group 8 as tranquillit\u00e0, is ready for the serious business ahead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
