It estimates that a child loses their home every eight minutes \u2013 183 children per day. At this rate, 1,647 children will become homeless between now and the general election on 12 December, and more than 4,000 by 25 December. London has the highest concentration of homeless youngsters, up 33% since 2014. About 88,000 children were homeless and in temporary accommodation in the capital at the beginning of 2019 \u2013 equivalent to one in every 24 children. The capital has 26 of the 30 British local authorities with the highest rates of homeless children. Four councils \u2013 Haringey, Newham, Westminster and Kensington &amp; Chelsea \u2013 had homeless rates of one in every 12 children. Outside London, the places worst affected were: Luton (one in 22 children); Brighton &amp; Hove (one in 30); Manchester (one in 47); and Slough (one in 53). In Wales, one in 412 children are homeless, up 28% since 2015, while in Scotland one in 160 children were homeless, up 64% since 2014. Over the past five years the number of homeless children living in temporary accommodation in Britain has risen by 51%. Latest figures show 5,683 children were living in emergency temporary accommodation such as B&amp;Bs or hostels, up 11% since 2014. Polly Neate, Shelter\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe fact 183 children become homeless every day is a scandalous figure and a sharp reminder that political promises about tackling homelessness must be turned into real action. \u201cDay in, day out we see the devastating impact the housing emergency is having on children across the country. They are being uprooted from friends, living in cold, cramped B&amp;Bs and going to bed at night scared by the sound of strangers outside.\u201d Earlier this year an analysis by the Children\u2019s Commissioner for England estimated that on top of the 124,000 children in temporary accommodation in England at the end of 2019, a further 92,000 were sofa-surfing with friends or relatives. The growing cost of housing homeless families has alarmed local authorities, which spent nearly \u00a31bn in England alone on temporary accommodation in 2018-18, up 71% from the \u00a3584m spent in 2012-13. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \u201cEvery child should have somewhere safe to live, and councils have a duty to provide temporary accommodation to those who need it, including families with children. \u201cWe\u2019re supporting them to reduce the numbers in temporary accommodation by giving \u00a31.2bn to tackle all types of homelessness.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
