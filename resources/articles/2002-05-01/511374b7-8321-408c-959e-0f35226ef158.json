The Monaco striker scored twice in the first half, along with Torsten Frings, Sebastian Deisler, in his first international for six months, and Sebastian Kehl. Bierhoff got his third from the spot after 71 minutes and Carsten Jancker completed the night's work. Rudi V\u00f6ller had only 11 of his World Cup squad available because the Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke players were needed for tomorrow's cup final and most of Borussia Dortmund's played in the Uefa Cup final on Wednesday. Berti Vogts has named eight uncapped players for Scotland's Far East tour: Chelsea's Warren Cummings, Sunderland's Kevin Kyle, West Brom's Scott Dobie, Rangers' Maurice Ross, Dundee's Lee Wilkie, Motherwell's James McFadden and the goalkeepers Neil Alexander of Cardiff and Paul Gallacher of Dundee United. All will feature against South Korea in Busan on Thursday, South Africa on May 20 or a Hong Kong Select on May 23, both in the former colony. Scotland squad: N Alexander (Cardiff), Douglas (Celtic), Gallacher (Dundee Utd), Sullivan (Spurs); G Caldwell (Newcastle), Cummings (Chelsea), Dailly (West Ham), Davidson (Leicester), Ross (Rangers), Stockdale (Middlesbrough), Weir (Everton), Wilkie (Dundee); G Alexander (Preston), Gemmill (Everton), McFadden (Motherwell), McNaughton (Aberdeen), Severin (Hearts), Stewart (Man Utd), Williams (Nottm Forest); Dobie (West Brom), Johnston (Middlesbrough), Kyle (Sunderland), O'Connor (Hibernian), Thompson (Dundee Utd). \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
