Bids to preserve a large area of pristine ocean off east Antarctica have struck opposition in the past, including at last year\u2019s meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, where China and Russia played a part in blocking the proposal. Australia is co-sponsoring the proposal for an East Antarctic Marine Protected Area, along with the European Union, and will resubmit it at this year\u2019s CCAMLR meeting. The organisation\u2019s membership includes 25 nations and the EU. The plan requires the support of all members for it to proceed. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, said the decision to pursue the sanctuary \u201cunderlines our commitment to protecting the Antarctic and Southern Ocean\u201d. Gillian Slocum, the leader of Australia\u2019s delegation to the CCAMLR, said the proposal would protect reefs and safeguard several marine species. \u201cWhen established, the East Antarctic MPA will protect distinctive deep-water reefs and feeding areas for marine mammals, penguins and other seabirds,\u201d she said. The Australian Antarctic Division said the proposed sanctuary would also provide scientific reference zones to help researchers understand the effects of fishing outside protected areas and the consequences of climate change for Southern Ocean ecosystems. The Australian Antarctic explorer and adventurer Tim Jarvis has called on member countries to support the plan, warning that climate change and the threat of industrial fishing were putting pressure \u201con this incredible place\u201d. \u201cIf you don\u2019t protect those resources, you risk disrupting the whole global food web in the ocean,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to head off climate change but you\u2019re going to make them more resilient to it. \u201cIf it could all be protected, that would be fantastic but if we could get this million square kilometres it would be a huge step in the right direction.\u201d But he added that most of the changes necessary to protect Antarctica and its marine life needed to be through a collective global effort to cut carbon pollution and limit global heating. \u201cYou want to protect Antarctica, we need to change the way we do things back in the rest of the world ... in the cities where 75% of us live, where we consume the energy that contributes to the CO2 emissions,\u201d he said.

Norway has supported the proposal since 2014."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
