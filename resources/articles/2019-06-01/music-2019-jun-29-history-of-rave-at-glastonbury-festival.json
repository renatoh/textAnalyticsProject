As if it weren\u2019t enough of a struggle trying to get people to untangle their first Glastonbury raving memories from three decades ago, the things they do remember feel pretty hallucinatory on their own. Nobody can be quite sure when raving first started in Glastonbury. Obviously all-night dancing predates acid house, but through the 80s that meant dub reggae: Youth of Killing Joke and the Orb remembers Saxon and Jah Shaka soundsystems as \u201cthe only music you could go dance to all night long that wasn\u2019t acoustic around a bonfire\u201d. The Mutoid Waste Company\u2019s dystopian wreckage sculptures hosted pagan-industrial metal-banging dances throughout the night. Dance music as such wasn\u2019t unknown, though. Mark Darby of Exeter\u2019s Mighty Force collective says: \u201cThe first traveller soundsystem playing dance music I personally heard was Crazy Dave\u2019s Record Bus \u2013 an old green coach with huge speakers \u2013 going through a disco phase, one afternoon at Stonehenge 83!\u201d It was 1989, however, when everything came together. The photographer Matt Smith was then a student, and Glastonbury was his first documentary project. \u201cI danced almost the whole festival long,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cI remember finding this double-decker bus in the Green Fields, disguised as a cafe but the tables were speakers, playing really beautiful deep house. It was dark when I got there, and I just danced for 14 hours, watched an amazing summer sunrise and carried on well into the next day. Then I remember sneaking down the side of a stall, and finding the Sugarlump tent, absolutely rammed and heaving, acid house and crazy lights. Before I knew it, my mate Dan was halfway up the tentpole raving with one hand, clinging on with the other.\u201d \u201cSneaking down the side of a stall\u201d was key in 1989. Though there were soundsystems like the Blim Brothers sound and a mythical rig featuring a rubber duck carousel in the travellers\u2019 field outside the festival perimeter, the real acid house action was in the traders\u2019 area, thanks to Sugarlump and Mindscapes. The former were a crew who\u2019d been putting on parties in London \u201cfor acid heads to dance to mainly psychedelic funk\u201d from the mid 80s, and gradually turned to electronic music. The latter was a stall set up by the incorrigible Peterborough-born ex-biker turned psychedelic artist turned acid house promoter Nick Mindscapes. \u201cI had a stall to sell my paintings,\u201d he says, \u201cso I set up decks, speakers, a big screen to project my visuals on, got a DJ playing and didn\u2019t stop from Thursday to Monday lunchtime.\u201d Sugarlump went even further. Graham Power describes it: \u201cWe had a whole marquee behind a stall, I think from Wednesday to Monday, with a huge rig. People would come in, drop their rucksacks and not leave \u2013 because there was everything they needed: music, drugs, food, and haybales to sleep on if they needed.\u201d They were not officially welcome at the festival \u2013 \u201cEavis hated acid house\u201d says Power \u2013 but were given a nod and wink by the ground staff. Indeed, Mindscapes recalls: \u201cWe blew a couple of fuses but, instead of shutting us down, the stewards got us wired into the festival power supply proper!\u201d All this represented a schism in the hippy/traveller community. Helen Hatt, a prime mover in the 80s Peace Convoy, says: \u201cWe thought the party people were litter louts, we wanted the scene to be about acoustic music and being with our families, and we kind of hid away in the Green Fields. After that we had to rename our festivals things like \u2018holistic holiday camps\u2019, just to make sure the authorities didn\u2019t think they were raves.\u201d From the other side, Mindscapes says: \u201cWatching the pissed folk-heads trying to get their feet round 120 beats per minutes was a whole lot of fun.\u201d Either way, it changed Glastonbury, the festival scene and many lives for good. By 1990 \u2013 the year of the Happy Mondays and riots in the traveller fields \u2013 there were mini-raves across the site. In 1992, Sugarlump \u201cgot given a whole field to do what we wanted in\u201d, and renowned soundsystem designer Tony Andrews set up the Experimental Sound Field with Underworld, Orbital and others playing all weekend. Finally, in 1995, it became clear that dance music culture was a major part of the festival, and Eavis brought in Malcolm Haynes to set up the first official dance tent. Contra the idea he hated dance music, Eavis didn\u2019t really know what it was: \u201cHe thought it was Massive Attack and Portishead!\u201d says Haynes. Haynes now presides over the huge Silver Hayes field, featuring multiple dance arenas, while the Arcadia and Bloc areas bring together rave culture with highly advanced versions of Mutoid Waste\u2019s vision. Many of those who were there in 89 never stopped dancing. Matt Smith says he \u201cwent home, developed my pictures then followed the traveller convoy to Treworgey Tree Fayre\u201d \u2013 the Cornish festival that Darby says is \u201cwhere house music really hit the traveller scene\u201d \u2013 and has been documenting subcultures, and especially free parties ever since. Power even remembers meeting a successful sound system designer recently, who had been taken by his parents into the Sugarlump tent in 1989, when he was 14. \u201cHe thought it was paradise, said to himself: \u2018This is how I want to live\u2019 \u2026 and that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s done.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
