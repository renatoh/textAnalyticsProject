The Great Britain loose-forward joined his boyhood hero - and former Saints coach - Ellery Hanley as the only players to have been presented with the award more than once since it was introduced in 1977. Hanley actually won it three times, in 1985, 1987 and 1989, but only Sculthorpe has retained the trophy. \"To win it last year was a massive honour but to get it twice in a row is something special, with nobody else having done it,\" said the 25-year-old, whose combination of toughness and skill has led the Saints back to Old Trafford for Saturday's grand final against the Bradford Bulls. The award followed the news that he had signed a three-year extension to his St Helens contract, which now runs until the end of the 2007 season. Sculthorpe confirmed on Monday that he had been the subject of interest from the rugby union Premiership champions Leicester and, more appealingly for him, several Australian league clubs - including Sydney Roosters, who won the National Rugby League grand final 10 days ago with a team including his fellow Lancastrian Adrian Morley. \"I can't see myself playing anything but league, although you've always got to listen, but playing in Australia is something I would like to do, and watching someone like Mozzer doing so well out there does make you think,\" he had said. But yesterday he followed his Saints team-mate Keiron Cunningham in rejecting rugby union and Australia to stay at Knowsley Road. \"There is no better place to be in world rugby,\" he was quoted as saying, although an annual salary of up to \u00a3200,000, far more than Australian clubs are able to offer because of their salary cap and the strength of the pound, will also have played its part. \"You've got to work out what's best for your family,\" Sculthorpe had added on Monday - he has a young child, Jake, and is getting married next year. He has carried the tag of the world's most expensive forward since Saints signed him from Warrington in December 1997 for \u00a3300,000 plus Morley's older brother Chris, then rated at \u00a370,000 but now in disgrace after a positive drugs test. Sculthorpe had been touted as a huge talent long before that, after Warrington signed him from the Royton Tigers junior club in his home town of Oldham, where he used to go sprint training with Iestyn Harris, two years his senior. He made his Great Britain debut as a teenager in 1996 and in the past four years has emerged as a player of true world class, winning his first grand final with Saints under Hanley in 1999 and developing further under Hanley's successor, Ian Millward. He has added such a range of handling and kicking skills to his strong running and tackling that he has filled in at stand-off for much of the past two seasons and played there for Great Britain in last autumn's Ashes series, scoring two tries in the first Test victory at Huddersfield. But it is Sculthorpe's durability that makes the Man of Steel title especially appropriate. He has missed only three of Saints' 35 games this season, scoring 16 tries and kicking 114 goals - despite flying to Sydney in July for Great Britain's humiliating 64-10 defeat by Australia, when he was one of only a few to escape with his reputation intact. Last year he missed five matches but four of those were because of a broken jaw and the other after he suffered a gash inside his mouth playing for Lancashire in the Origin match. It needed 50 stitches but Sculthorpe was playing again within a week - though, as he joked at the time, \"I won't be eating salt and vinegar crisps for a while\". That was typical of the down-to-earth attitude that rugby league takes for granted even in its superstars. The night before Saints' qualifying semi-final against Bradford Sculthorpe was at the JJB Stadium watching his younger brother Danny playing for Wigan - and queuing up for a Coke with the rest of the fans. \"That's the thing about Scully, he's as good a bloke as he is a player,\" said Millward. \"I can't believe there's a more marketable guy in British sport, and I've been saying for years that the Rugby League over here need to get hold of him and make him the face of the game.\" With two Man of Steels under his belt, that is now unavoidable.
