That\u2019s it from me. It\u2019s been a thrill. Unless you\u2019re Belgian, obviously. Here, by way of parting gift, is a match report. Enjoy! All is not lost for Belgium. Lukaku was terrible, and shouldn\u2019t start their next game. Origi\u2019s mobility and speed gave Italy real problems, even if he missed a good chance, messed up another for Fellaini and also randomly donkeyed the ball out of play for no good reason at one point. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything yet,\u201d says Conte. And Pell\u00e8\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t exactly a tap-in, either. The ball came to him at waist height, and it took some effort to keep his foot over it, but the volley was vicious and also perfect. That was probably the best game of the tournament so far. It never dipped below interesting, was tactically fascinating, had moments of great quality and skill, but also of immense athleticism, and two lovely goals. \u201cI don\u2019t want to brag too much about it, but \u2026\u201d says Luca Vialli. And that\u2019s the last meaningful action of the night! What a win for Italy! And Pell\u00e8 seals the win! That\u2019s a stylish goal on the counter, Immobile carrying the ball into Belgium\u2019s half and finding Candreva, who draws the keeper and instead of shooting chips to the far post, where Pell\u00e8 slams the ball in on the volley! 90+2 mins: Bonucci finds Giaccherini with a raking crossfield pass, but the midfielder can\u2019t control. 90+1 mins: Vertonghen has talked his way into the book, where he is the first Belgian name. 90+1 mins: We\u2019re into stoppage time, of which there will be at least three minutes. 90 mins: And then a cross from the right is missed at the near post by Origi, so surprising Fellaini that he fails to capitalise at the far! 89 mins: Oooh! Hazard is held up by Immobile so passes to, um, someone, who dances into the area but picks out the only bit of box without a Belgian in! 88 mins: \u2026 which is delayed so that the referee can talk to Fellaini, who was trying to run to the near post, and Chiellini, who appeared intent on strangling him. 87 mins: Belgium are huffing and puffing now. They nick the ball off Italy in the Italians\u2019 half, and though the cross is overhit, Alderweireld chases it down and wins a corner. 85 mins: And Italy break, sprint forward and Immobile thwacks a shot goalwards from 20 yards which Courtois tips athletically wide! 84 mins: Oooh! A cross from the right looks to be heading to Fellaini, until Origi flings a foot at it and bicycle kicks wide. 84 mins: Thiago Motta gets booked for fouling Hazard for no good reason in an irrelevant part of the pitch. It\u2019s all becoming a bit desperate from the leaders. 82 mins: Chance! De Bruyne crosses from the left, and Origi at the near post flicks the ball over the bar! 82 mins: The number of times Italy have ended up desperately clinging on to a one goal lead. The last couple of minutes have been all Belgium. 80 mins: \u201cI think you\u2019re being harsh on Hazard,\u201d writes Richard Mellor. \u201cHe is at least in 6/10 territory, ahead of De Bruyne and Lukaku. Somewhere, in a dark, vindictive, special room, Jose Mourinho is chuckling and saying \u2018That\u2019s why I let them both go.\u2019\u201d He\u2019s improved since the move into the middle, for sure. He hasn\u2019t produced a defining moment yet, but at least he looks willing and able. 80 mins: Mertens sizes up a shot from 25 yards, and two Italians fling themselves at him, Parolo winning the race to take one in the face. 78 mins: Another substitution: Daniele De Rossi has come off, and Thiago Motta has come on. And Belgium waste their free-kick, hoisting it too close to Buffon. 78 mins: About three seconds after I write that, Bonucci puts a foot wrong. Origi spins and heads off towards Italy\u2019s area, and Bonucci slides in late and takes his legs away. Another booking. 77 mins: Italy\u2019s defence is just excellent. Chiellini and Bonucci, in particular, have barely put a foot wrong. 76 mins: Also, Ciman has left the field, and Carrasco has entered it. 74 mins: Hilarious double-foul from Eder! Candreva gives the ball away foolishly and Belgium break, at least for as long as it takes Eder to grab Mertens around the neck, haul him down and then boot the ball as hard as he can down the pitch. That\u2019s the very epitome of cynical. He\u2019s booked, and immediately replaced. Immobile comes on. 74 mins: Parolo slides the ball along the edge of the Belgium area to Giaccherini, whose shot on the half-turn was heading wide, but was deflected wider. Corner. 73 mins: Lukaku\u2019s game is over. Divock Origi, who also has a novelty hairstyle, replaces him. 72 mins: Hazard is pushing, trying, but Belgium\u2019s attacks keep dying out the moment they hit Lukaku. 69 mins: Hazard has space and runs at the Italy defence. The massed ranks in red roar. De Bruyne runs to his right, Lukaku to his left. Options. Potential. He passes into a defender\u2019s leg, collects the rebound and runs into another defender\u2019s leg. 68 mins: \u201cI think it\u2019s too much to ask that Belgium win here,\u201d writes Patrick Sullivan. \u201cThey have their chocolate and their lambic. It would not be right that they have a winning team as well. After all, Italy only has, well, Italians.\u201d Not a fan of vino or prosciutto, then? 67 mins: Pell\u00e8 is currently off the pitch, apparently having a dislocated finger relocated. 66 mins: Chiellini gets himself a booking, for pulling Hazard back on the half-way line. 63 mins: Hazard, having failed to impress on the left, and failed to impress on the right, has now moved central. He\u2019s now playing just off Lukaku, with Fellaini back in the midfield engine room. 63 mins: The corner is eventually worked back to De Bruyne, who crosses over everyone and out of play. 62 mins: Vertonghen curls in an excellent cross from deep on the left, and earns his side a corner. Belgium make their first substitution before they take it, Nainggolan coming off and Mertens coming on. 60 mins: Lukaku is a lumbering mess. He\u2019s not holding the ball up when it\u2019s played to his feet or chest, and he\u2019s not running behind the defence either. \u201cPoor old Lukaku,\u201d writes Charles Antaki. \u201cYou can take the player out of Everton but, on tonight\u2019s performance, you can\u2019t take the Everton out of the player.\u201d 59 mins: The game\u2019s first substitution sees Darmian come off and De Sciglio come on. 58 mins: A much better corner from De Bruyne, prompting some panic in the Italy defence \u2013 but also a free kick, awarded \u2013 inevitably \u2013 against Fellaini. 56 mins: Hazard cuts in from the right and shoots with his left foot. It\u2019s hard, and it\u2019s on target, but it\u2019s right at Buffon, who pats it down and then collects. 54 mins: Great save Courtois! Italy storm up the other end, move the ball from left to right, chip it into the mixer, Pell\u00e8 heads towards the corner of the net, but the goalkeeper flings himself to his right and gets a fingertip to it! 53 mins: \u2026 Belgium counter-attack down the right, De Bruyne picks Lukaku out with a first-time crossfield pass, and the striker tries to chip over Buffon \u2013 which he does \u2013 and in \u2013 which he doesn\u2019t. Their finest chance of the game by a mile, and it should have led to an equaliser. 53 mins: Candreva is played in on the right, but Vertonghen recovers to slide the ball out of play. It\u2019s still the Italians threatening, though. Until \u2026 52 mins: Belgium now seem to be playing with something more like a traditional front two, with Fellaini partnering Lukaku. 50 mins: The furious post-half-time-rollicking Belgian assault has not transpired. 46 mins: Parolo is played into the area, and plenty of space, but despite having two opportunities to do so, he fails to find a team-mate. 46 min: And they\u2019re off! The players are back out, ready for half two. It\u2019s time for Marc Wilmots to earn his corn. His team seems to be playing to Italy\u2019s strengths: they need to turn them and stretch them. The half\u2019s other moment of interest saw Antonio Conte get a blood nose after some boisterous post-goal celebrating. \u201cI do think more mention should be made of the Italian team\u2019s socks,\u201d writes Kimberley Thonger. \u201cThey are surely the most splendid pieces of hosiery worn by any team this side of the 1970s.\u201d Well, that is quite the reaction. I think they\u2019re a lot more interesting from the back than from the front, and are thus at best only 50% good. \u201cSomehow I had never noticed this but Eden Hazard is Belgium\u2019s captain? They really have no better candidate?\u201d boggles JR. \u201cWhat\u2019s he going to lead them to, eating hamburgers during the game?\u201d He certainly seems the quiet type, rather than the chest-thumping, inspirational leader kind. Plus he comes into the tournament on the back of a season of sustained underachievement. Gianluca Vialli\u2019s half-time summary: \u201cYou\u2019ve seen a bunch of very talented individuals, and less talented players who play as a team.\u201d 45+1 mins: And that\u2019s half time. Belgium have been very poor, Italy impressive. 45 mins: Another half-chance for Italy! Candreva gets down the right, and his low cross finds Pell\u00e8, and he \u2026 well \u2026 side-foots weakly into Ciman, who stops the ball going way wide. 45 mins: Barzagli grabs a fistful of Fellaini\u2019s shirt as the pair tussle for a cross, and somehow translates this into an Italy free kick. 43 mins: Another vague sniff of potential for Belgium: a cross from the right, a nod down from Fellaini, and Lukaku waves a half-interested boot at the ball as it bounces through to Buffon. I did say vague. 41 mins: Belgium\u2019s best moment of the half sees De Bruyne picked out with a low pass as he makes a run from the right into the area, but he\u2019s immediately and inevitably closed down, and his shot is blocked. \u201cYou wonder how an attacking line up including Hazard, de Bruyne, and Lukaku can seem so disjointed,\u201d writes Hugh Molloy. \u201cI think United fans would call this the Fellaini factor. He\u2019s an effective footballer as an individual, but totally ruins the shape of a forward line.\u201d 39 mins: Witsel shoots wide from 22 yards. Italy have kept both Hazard and De Bruyne extremely quiet, and Belgium have done little more than chance their arm occasionally from distance. 36 mins: And they should be two up! A cross is half-cleared, up into the air, and headed back into the mixer, where Pell\u00e8 is all alone, six yards out, with the goalkeeper out of position, but he sends the ball wide! 36 mins: That\u2019s an excellent corner, and the ball lands seven yards from goal, level with the far post, but nobody\u2019s there to put it away! 35 mins: From the right-hand corner of the area Candreva slams a left-footed shot goalwards. A fine strike, but a straightforward save. Corner. 33 mins: As good as the pass was, it would have been for nought had Giaccherini not controlled it spectacularly well. Lovely work. Hazard immediately pops up on the right wing for the first time. He\u2019s done very little on the left, so it\u2019s not much of a surprise. What a pass, and Italy take the lead! I think it was Bonucci\u2019s ball, from just inside his half, over the defence and perfectly into the run of Giaccherini, who controls, opens up his body and shoots past Courtois! 30 mins: Eder tries a high, volleyed pass to Parolo and overhits it, and while every Belgian stands still Candreva sprints down the line to keep it in and finds himself in all sorts of space, but his cross back towards Eder is cleared. 28 mins: Pell\u00e8 attempts a 20-yard curler across goal from left to right, but it flies a couple of yards wide. \u201cBelgium seem to have taken the approach that, unable to play straight through this wall of an Italian defence nor cross with success, they will pass back and shoot from range,\u201d writes Jeremy Dresner. \u201cA low-scoring, low chance game therefore always threatens to light up suddenly with the spark of a Thunderbastard!\u201d 24 mins: De Bruyne hits a genuinely terrible corner, which bounces a couple of times on its way to the nearest Italian. 23 mins: Giaccherini has the ball, right on the corner of the penalty area, on the left near the touchline, when Ciman slides in and the Italian goes tumbling. There was very little contact there, perhaps none, but Ciman must still have been very relieved when Clattenburg awarded a goal kick. 22 mins: Italy basically have a back five when not in possession, and a front four when they do, with the two full-backs forming part of both groups. They\u2019re going to be knackered by the evening\u2019s end. 20 mins: Belgium are looking, and failing to find, a killer pass. First Vertonghen\u2019s ball into Fellaini is ushered out of play by Chiellini, then Nainggolan\u2019s chip towards Lukaku runs just beyond him. 17 mins: The game has settled into a very enjoyable pace. Not so fast as to be manic, not so slow as to be stilted. Possession changing hands regularly, the ball zipping from one end to the other. No chances yet, but it\u2019s all very promising. 15 mins: And then some good play by Belgium. They\u2019re taking turns, two good minutes each. These end with Chiellini thumping the ball into touch when under little pressure, but the corner is headed clear. 13 mins: Some good play from Italy, working the ball around and up to the edge of Belgium\u2019s penalty area, though then Pell\u00e8 hits a pass to Darmian that\u2019s too strong and rumbles out of play. 11 mins: The corner gives Fellaini a first chance to get physical with Chiellini from a set piece, and sure enough he gives the Italian a good shove after the ball passes over them both. 10 mins: \u2026 and Belgium break, their efforts ending in a fine, fierce Nainggolan shot from 20 yards which Buffon turns round the post. 10 mins: Now Candreva attacks, ignoring a Belgian player collapsed on the turf in midfield, but his cross is poor, and cleared. 8 mins: Candreva, under pressure, facing his own goal, 25 yards out, juggles the ball over his shoulder, spins, controls it, turns again and plays a pass into midfield. Nicely done. 7 mins: Eder challenges Vermaelen and catches his ankle with a raised boot. Vermaelen wails and rolls around in unnecessary style, and seems quite affronted that all his effort didn\u2019t even bring a booking. 4 mins: The first shot of the night comes from Eder, just outside the penalty area, but it deflects off a defender and rolls harmlessly to Courtois. 2 mins: Lukaku hares into space down the right, but his low centre finds only a defender. 1 min: Italy, in white shirts, get the ball rolling, and pump it straight out of play on the left. Time to find out, then \u2026 Fellaini has a blond \u2019fro. That is all. Italy\u2019s anthem is a real challenge for aspiring choirmembers. So many words. The players are in the tunnel. \u201cI think we will take Belgium by storm for at least the first 30 minutes,\u201d predicts Gianluca Vialli in the BBC studio. Crikey. Looks like it\u2019s rained a bit in Lyon: \u201cWhat is Marc Wilmots thinking?\u201d wails Kelvin. \u201cFellaini and his afro start ahead of Dembele, Carrasco and Mertens? Why?\u201d He does offer them a second option: they\u2019ve got beauty, in Hazard and De Bruyne, but they\u2019ve also got the beast. Having just one of them, as Spain showed earlier (for quite a long time, at least), doesn\u2019t always work. Stop this madness. Here\u2019s the official Euro 2016-endorsed team sheet: Gianluca Vialli\u2019s resemblance to James Richardson is getting genuinely uncanny. I know what you\u2019re all thinking: yeah, fine, Buffon, Hazard, whatever. Tell us about the stadium already. This is indeed pleasant. I too don\u2019t know how popular they are, but I do know that they are a lot less popular than Technotronic. Italy\u2019s starting XI: Buffon; Barzagli, Bonucci, Chiellini; Candreva, Parolo, De Rossi, Giaccherini, Darmian; Pell\u00e8, Eder. Here, for balance, is the biggest-selling Belgian song in Belgium. It\u2019s less obviously entertaining. Surprisingly \u2013 given that they\u2019ve got not one but two languages of their own \u2013 most of Belgium\u2019s most successful Belgian music appears to be sung in English (I\u2019ve just listened to every Belgian song in their top 50, which is probably taking preparation a little too far. One video featured quite a lot of a man in a polar bear suit, though, so it wasn\u2019t all bad): Belgium\u2019s team is in: Hello world! Well, it\u2019s only the best national team in Europe \u2013 we know this already, thanks to Fifa\u2019s handy rankings, pretty much making this entire tournament obsolete, but we won\u2019t let that stop us \u2013 against the seventh best national team in Europe! Belgium are the high-flyers, considered by the game\u2019s international arbiters the second finest side on the planet. Italy, despite an uninspiring qualifying campaign, which among other highlights featured home and away laboured 1-0 wins over Malta, are a global No12 in the Fifa hit parade, but it\u2019s on the field of Lyon\u2019s Stade de, um, Lyon (aka Stade de Gerland) this evening that their actual merit will be decided. And, what with this being the outstanding tie of the opening round of group games, it has been honoured with the presence of a crack squadron of English referees, led by Mark Clattenburg with the familiar faces of Andre Marriner and Anthony Taylor, also Premier League whistle-peepers, lurking behind the two penalty areas. So that\u2019s nice. The two teams have played 21 times, with Italy winning 13 of those games and losing only four. But they have met only once in this decade, when Belgium came from behind to win 3-1. But first, some music! This is the biggest-selling Italian song in Italy at the moment, and the video offers everything you could possibly ask of it, including but not limited to baby pigs, people in outrageously skimpy shorts and some kind of novelty arm-based dance routines. Enjoy. Simon will be here shortly. In the meantime, why not have a read of Kristof Terreur\u2019s profile of the new Vincent Kompany, Manchester City\u2019s Jason Denayer? He has some Kompany in him. His nickname (the new Kompany), his club (Manchester City), his position (central defender), his skills (strong, fast, technically good), his origin (a Brussels \u2018ketje\u2019 from a mixed family) and this summer he could also replace him in the national team. Let\u2019s introduce you to Jason Denayer, a warrior trained in bare feet. He would probably rather make a name for himself \u2013 and he may have to wait a few games after Marc Wilmots decided against starting him at Euro 2016 in central defence \u2013 but Denayer cannot deny the comparisons to his countryman. When he signed on loan for Celtic in 2014, the Scottish club proudly presented him as the \u201cnew Kompany\u201d. It said everything about his reputation and his potential. Only time will tell if Denayer follows in Kompany\u2019s footsteps to become one of the Premier League\u2019s best defenders. The 20-year-old defender spent the past season on loan at Galatasaray but in the summer he returns to Manchester City and he hopes to convince Pep Guardiola of his qualities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
