As the Guardian reported in an exclusive on Thursday night, Clinton is set to announce her candidacy for the Democratic nomination on Sunday. The president was speaking in Panama City, after an historic meeting with Cuban president Ra\u00fal Castro on the sidelines of the Summit of the Americas and before a diplomatically delicate meeting with the Venezuelan president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. The president said Clinton \u2013 who was first lady for eight years, then senator for New York and secretary of state in his first term in office \u2013 \u201cwas a formidable candidate in 2008, she was a great supporter of mine in the general election, she was an outstanding secretary of state, she is my friend. \u201cI think she would be an excellent president.\u201d Obama hedged his bets over whether Clinton would indeed run, being careful not to appear to steal her thunder. But in a lengthy press conference during which American journalists asked questions about the nuclear deal with Iran and Clinton as well as probing the historic meeting with Castro, he said: \u201cThe one thing I can say is, she\u2019s going to be able to handle herself very well in any conversation or debates around foreign policy. \u201cAnd her track record with respect to domestic policies is I think one that cares about working families.\u201d \u201cIf she decides to run,\u201d Obama said, \u201cand she makes an announcement, she\u2019s going to have some strong messages to deliver.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
