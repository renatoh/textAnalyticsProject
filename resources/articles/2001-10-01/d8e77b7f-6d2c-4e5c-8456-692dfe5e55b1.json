Should a good malt whisky be matured in a sherry butt? Or is a former Kentucky bourbon barrel (which is far more widely used in Scotland today) the appropriate vessel? As things turned out, this was just the first shot in the war of the woods, not yet finished. Tipplers with a sweet tooth tend to favour the richness imparted by the sherry butt, and typically found in malts such as Macallan and Glenfarclas. This style is the more traditional, dating from the days when the wines of Jerez were shipped in wood to Bristol and Leith, and the empty butts snapped up by the whisky distillers. Traditional it may be, but sherry wood irritates some purists. As sherry consumption diminished, bourbon casks emerged as an alternative. Kentucky bourbon whiskey is always matured in new barrels. The corn-tasting whiskey soaks up the vanilla flavours from the wood. The barrels then arrive in Britain in more muted mood, and have a much gentler impact when they are filled with the subtler Scotch whisky. They are thus less likely to mask the taste of the whisky itself. I like both: a heathery, briney, dryish whisky from a bourbon cask before dinner; a fruity, nutty, sherried malt as a digestif. But what about other woods? This is where the war has escalated. A Scotch whisky may be matured for anything from eight to 25 years, and a cask may be used three or four times. A distillery may therefore have casks that were acquired many decades ago, long before inventories were controlled by computer. Job lots bought as 'sherry' casks often included the odd port pipe or madeira drum. Some distillers dispute this, but I first saw port pipes in a distillery almost 20 years ago. In 1994, the Glenmorangie distillery, whose principal whisky is aged entirely in bourbon casks, began to look at the potential of other woods. This led to the release of a version matured for 10 years in the usual way, then transferred for a few months to port pipes. I thought the whisky had a faint pinkish blush; a fruity, slightly winey, aroma and palate; and a soothing finish. I loved it, and still do. What at first seemed like a tentative experiment, or a novelty, led to a deluge of 'wood finishes'. The duration of finishing varies, but it is usually between six months and two years at an absolute maximum. Glenmorangie has since launched bourbon-aged whiskies 'finished' in dry oloroso sherry, fino sherry (a particular favourite of mine), claret, Tain L'Hermitage, C\u00f4te de Beaune and C\u00f4te de Nuits, among others. Its sister distillery, Glen Moray, has been finished in Chardonnay and Chenin Blanc. The mighty Lagavulin has wrestled with Pedro Ximinez sherry; Talisker with amoroso; Glenkinchie with amontillado; Dalwhinnie with oloroso; Oban with montilla; Cragganmore with ruby port. The Glenlivet has versions finished in American oak and French oak. Bowmore has produced a claret finish, an oloroso finish (called Darkest) and two port finishes (one called Dawn and a slightly richer version called Voyager). Balvenie, with its long-established Double Wood (matured in bourbon; finished in sweet oloroso), recently presented something altogether more offbeat: an Islay finish. Eyebrows were raised at an aristocratic whisky from the mountain valleys of Speyside sleeping in a cask previously occupied by an oily, seaweedy, salty Islay malt. By now, whisky fundamentalists were ready to invade. The net was ablaze with accusations: wood finishes were becoming profligate; merely a marketing device; a way of exploiting the renown of a particular malt by producing endless versions; 'shagging the brand', as one (female) marketing person put it. This complaint seemed to me churlish. Finishing in wine casks of whatever stripe does not cheapen the whisky. It helps create interest in Scotch. The Balvenie Islay Cask raised another question. The typically honeyed flavours of Balvenie had clearly been augmented by smoke and salt. Could this have been contributed solely by solids on the inside of the cask, or whatever had been absorbed by the wood? Or had some Islay whisky remained in the cask and been combined with the Balvenie? If the latter, was Balvenie Islay Cask still a single malt? Rumours spread that the Scotch Whisky Association was making threatening noises, anxious to protect the appellation. The association denied this. Then it turned out that there was more than one Islay finish. The Famous Grouse had simultaneously pursued the same idea. At the same time, Grouse launched a port finish. Yes, Grouse the blended Scotch. It is one thing for single malt whiskies, something of an exclusive club, to affect fancy finishes, but blended whiskies? They are supposed to be the regular guys in the pub. Now it emerges that there are democratic finishes. Glenfiddich's blended brother Grant's has launched a sherry finish and an ale-cask finish (see Whisky Web, below). Now I'm just waiting for the whisky cask ale. Best cellars: Going with the grain: good sherry, wine and port finishes Glenmorangie Three Cask Matured Limited Edition (\u00a329.99, exclusive to Sainsbury's). This is the distillery's most recent creation. It is not a 'finish' but a vatting from Bourbon, plain oak and Rioja. It has the aroma of ripe, or cooked fruits, and scented, dryish, palate. Fruit pie dusted with icing sugar? A brace of Grouse (\u00a315.99, Safeway). The Port Wood Finish is more toffeeish, and spicier, than the regular Grouse. The Islay Cask Finish wraps the sweetness of the Grouse in lingering, silky, smokiness. There is also some saltiness. Waitrose Highland Malt (\u00a312.35). This own-brand malt has a sherry finish, and is light and smooth, with suggestions of marzipan and salted almonds. If you fancy a dram of something richer and winier, try a drop of Waitrose's 1981 Speyside matured entirely in port wood (\u00a319.99). World whisky web What's the bottle? Grant's Ale Cask Reserve Price and stockist \u00a312.99, Sainsbury's What's interesting about this whisky? A strong, malty, 'real ale' was specially made at the Caledonian Brewery, in Edinburgh. Empty bourbon finishing casks were filled with the ale. It was left there for three months, then removed. The idea was that the ale would permeate the cask, reacting with components of the wood to create a new habitat for the whisky. Grant's regular blended whisky, already matured for several years in former Bourbon barrels, was then filled into the casks and left for a further several months. What does this whisky smell and taste like? The end product is maltier than the usual Grant's and slightly syrupy, with fresh, nectar-like, fruity notes. Citrus is especially evident, but also suggestions of more tropical fruits. What does it go with? As whisky is distilled beer, the two drinks are natural partners. Hence the Scottish 'half and half' (a nip of whisky, chased by a half-pint of beer). Try this whisky with India Pale Ale - before, or with, a curry. Which India Pale Ale? Deuchar's, made by Caledonian, is especially recommended. Serving temperature Room or cellar temperature. Will it keep?
