Here was nothing less than the rebirth of England, thanks to a quite magnificent performance against a New Zealand side touted as being among the best of all time. After going ahead with the first of Owen Farrell's penalties, England were never headed. Only once, indeed, were they really threatened, when a quickfire pair of tries by Julian Savea and Kieran Read in the 10 minutes after the interval, both converted by Dan Carter, put the All Blacks within a point of their hosts. That was the test. This was where we would see the mettle of the side assembled by Stuart Lancaster. Would their young men buckle? They did not. More than that, they got back on to the front foot, and finally their threequarters, whose contribution to the earlier autumn internationals had attracted considerable criticism, found the opportunity to prove their worth, winning by a record margin of 38-21. The tries by Bradley Barritt in the 54th minute, Chris Ashton in the 58th and Manu Tuilagi in the 61st achieved what had seemed the impossible result of shattering the New Zealanders' legendary composure. From a position of looking as though they were slipping into the gear that would consign the memory of England's handsome lead to oblivion and heap further humiliation on the heads of a side whose year looked like heading for an ignominious finish, they simply fell apart. This was not a performance that secured a World Cup, so it cannot be called England's greatest. But their seizing of the Sir Edmund Hillary Shield in such a manner will take a place of honour in the annals of Twickenham, a performance against which those of teams in the years to come will be measured. Lancaster's England were not playing for the history books. They were playing for their pride and their future, succeeding on both counts in front of their supporters among a crowd of 81,416 who went home knowing they had been present at a remarkable occasion. So the All Blacks' fine record of unbeaten matches was finally ended at the 21st time of asking, and their hope of going through the calendar year without defeat was washed away by an English optimism that came from who knows where. Richie McCaw will go off on his six-month sabbatical with a gnawing feeling of failure to set against his many triumphs. This is a result that will stand England in good stead for the next three years, as they build towards the World Cup on home ground. Barring some sudden collective collapse of form and fortune, it will enable them to take the field against any opposition feeling that they are on an equal footing. That is something beyond price \u2013 as long as they do not take the best scoreline against the All Blacks since 1936 as a cue for a bout of over-confidence. You would bet on Lancaster, with the aid of Graham Rowntree, to keep their feet on the ground. And it is Rowntree, the forwards coach, who can take great credit for this result, since it was in the physical power and mental intransigence of the pack that the victory had its origins. Throughout the 80 minutes the tight five never seemed to take a backward step. Five minutes before half-time, two bullocking runs by the hooker Tom Youngs put a spring in the step of the whole team. In the second row the 21-year-old Joe Launchbury is the find of the autumn; a lock of not just the requisite size and jumping power but with positional intelligence and fine skills. But all eight members of the pack and their replacements deserved the highest credit. As did Farrell, who came into this match replacing the injured Toby Flood, with many observers wondering exactly what he had done to deserve his place in the shortlist for the IRB player of the year. The question seemed to have additional point when his first pass went forward \u2013 although not spotted by the officials \u2013 and he failed to find touch with his first attempt. There was some consolation to be had in the knowledge that Dan Carter, the world's leading points scorer in Test rugby, was doing no better. A diagonal kick aimed at Cory Jane found the winger starting his run from an offside position, and when Alex Corbisiero unwittingly got in the way of Aaron Smith's break, Carter placed a straight 40m penalty wide of the posts. He was to miss again later in the first half from an equally promising position. By that time Farrell had nailed the first of the three penalties which, with a smart drop goal, gave England their 12-0 advantage as they went in for the break, rising to 15-0 when the Saracens fly-half sent another long-range penalty sailing between the posts two minutes after the resumption. The home side had been well worth their lead, but it was for what they accomplished as the match entered its decisive phase that this match will be remembered. Rocked back by the world champions, they appeared to be heading for an inevitable fate. Their refusal to accept that inevitability, their sheer guts and spirit allied to a visibly growing confidence in their ability to express themselves brought them a reward that none present will forget."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
