A judge is expected to sign legal papers transferring the Amazon shares \u2013 worth $38bn (\u00a329bn) \u2013 into MacKenzie Bezos\u2019s name. It is by some distance the largest divorce settlement in history the previous record was $2.5bn paid to Jocelyn Wildenstein when she divorced art dealer Alec Wildenstein in 1999. Following the settlement MacKenzie Bezos, 49, an author, will become the world\u2019s fourth-richest woman, and has already promised to give away at least half of her fortune. MacKenzie, who married Jeff in 1993, a year before he started Amazon from his garage in Seattle, has said she had \u201ca disproportionate amount of money to share\u201d and promised to work hard at giving it away \u201cuntil the safe is empty\u201d. She made the declaration in a letter to the Giving Pledge, the philanthropic initiative created by the investor Warren Buffett and Microsoft\u2019s principal founder, Bill Gates, to encourage the world\u2019s richest people to commit to giving away at least half their wealth to charity. Despite handing over the vast sum, Jeff Bezos will still be the world\u2019s richest individual with a $118bn fortune. He has not signed up to the Giving Pledge. He has given $2bn, less than 2% of his wealth, to the Bezos Day One Fund to help address homelessness and improve education for children in low-income families. He has congratulated his former wife in a tweet linking to her Giving Pledge letter. \u201cMacKenzie is going to be amazing and thoughtful and effective at philanthropy, and I\u2019m proud of her,\u201d he said. \u201cHer letter is so beautiful. Go get \u2019em MacKenzie.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
