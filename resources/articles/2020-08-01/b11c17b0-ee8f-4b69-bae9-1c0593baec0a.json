Opposition supporters took the streets of the capital, Minsk, and several other cities for the third night running on Tuesday despite a huge police crackdown as anger at the 26-year rule of president Alexander Lukashenko continued to grow. Protesters clashed with police, who used stun grenades and rubber bullets to try to disperse the crowds who were also angry that police had attacked demonstrators laying flowers at the site where a young man was killed a day earlier. In a video published on Tuesday morning, a visibly distressed Tikhanovskaya indicated she had faced an ultimatum involving her family and was forced to flee for neighbouring Lithuania. \u201cGod forbid you face the kind of choice that I faced,\u201d she said. \u201cChildren are the most important thing in our lives.\u201d The circumstances of Tikhanovskaya\u2019s departure suggested that Lukashenko was increasing pressure on her as he sought to quash the biggest protests of his 26 years in power. Lithuania\u2019s foreign minister, Linas Linkevi\u010dius, told the Guardian that Tikhanovskaya had been detained by Belarusian authorities for seven hours after filing a complaint against vote-rigging and had crossed the border early on Tuesday. Before leaving Belarus, Tikhanovskaya appeared to have been forced to read a statement on camera calling on her supporters not to attend anti-government rallies. In a video apparently filmed on Monday in the central elections commission building in Minsk, Tikhanovskaya read from a piece of paper: \u201cBelarusians, I urge you to be reasonable and respect the law. I don\u2019t want blood or violence. I ask you not to resist the police, not to go to the square, not to put your lives in danger.\u201d Tikhanovskaya sent her children out of Belarus during the campaign after she said she had received threats. Her husband, a popular YouTuber who was blocked from the elections, has been in jail in Belarus since May. \u201cIf the authorities put Svetlana in prison or charge her, this would have fuelled the protests even more,\u201d said Katsiaryna Shmatsina , a political analyst at the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies. \u201cWhat they intended to do most likely was to force Svetlana to leave the country to show that she is not strong enough, that she does not have the potential to be the leader.\u201d A member of her campaign team said that Tikhanovskaya had been pressurised to leave the country by the government in exchange for the release of her campaign manager, Maria Moroz, who had been held by police since Saturday. Linkevi\u010dius confirmed that Tikhanovskaya and Moroz had come to Lithuania together. Asked whether Tikhanovskaya had fled or been expelled, he said: \u201cIt was not her intention, I believe, to leave Belarus, but it was the only option she could take, I believe.\u201d Veronika Tsepkalo, a senior ally of Tikhanovskaya, said she too had fled the country late on Monday evening after being told there was \u201can order out for my arrest\u201d. She had returned to Belarus one day earlier from Russia, where her husband, a former presidential candidate, had also fled last month. According to the elections commission Tikhanovskaya took just 10.09% of the vote, while Lukashenko won 80.08%. On Monday Tikhanovskaya filed a complaint against the official results at the commission building. At least one person was killed and dozens injured in clashes between riot police and protesters on Monday night. The fighting appeared to escalate as police once again employed rubber bullets and stun grenades against demonstrators, while some shot back with fireworks and several Molotov cocktails, according to a Guardian reporter who estimated the crowd at several thousand people. Protesters also began constructing crude barricades from shopping carts, fencing, breezeblocks and other items found on the street. Some said they had decided to join the protests after scenes of intense violence on Sunday evening, when police attacked demonstrators with rubber bullets, water cannon, stun grenades and batons. \u201cI never went to protests before and until yesterday I told everyone I know not to go either,\u201d said a young protester in a hoodie wearing a medical mask. \u201cBut when I saw how they beat people across the street from my house, I realised I couldn\u2019t sit at home any longer.\u201d \u201cLook at what\u2019s happening in Belarus,\u201d Tsepkalo said. \u201cPeople are fighting for their right to choose their president. It\u2019s unacceptable that Lukashenko is shedding the blood of Belarusian people and ordering mass arrests for that.\u201d Lukashenko, who is facing the deepest crisis of his 26 years in power, has threatened to crush any illegal rallies. The protests have largely been decentralised, with no clear leader, although popular bloggers on social media have played an important role in their coordination. Protesters organising over Telegram channels discussed bringing protective gear such as goggles and first-aid kits as they expected further clashes with riot police. On Tuesday evening, the Telegram channel Nexta told its readers to meet at 7pm in small groups of fewer than 20 and to occupy streets: \u201cParalyse the city! \u2026 Block the roads!\u201d The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, tweeted on Tuesday: \u201cViolent repression and arrests of peaceful protesters in Belarus have to stop.\u201d The EU has said it is reassessing relations with Lukashenko\u2019s government, but has so far stopped short of proposing sanctions. \u201cThis is such a serious situation, it really needs a profound discussion among the member states,\u201d said a spokesman for Borrell. There are fears that Hungary could block EU sanctions, which require unanimity, after the prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, called in June for the bloc to drop existing measures against Belarus. Tikhanovskaya was initially a stand-in candidate for her husband. But she grew into an effective campaigner, attracting more than 63,000 people to a rally last month in Minsk, and thousands more in small cities and towns usually dominated by Lukashenko. Lukashenko, often referred to as Europe\u2019s last dictator, came to power in 1994. Foreign observers have not declared a Belarusian election free and fair since 1995. He was already facing unprecedented anger over his handling of the economy and a bungled coronavirus response.
