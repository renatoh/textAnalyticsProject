An RAF Sea King helicopter battled force nine winds at the edge of its range to attempt the rescue of the skipper of the Horncliff, a cargo ship carrying bananas and other fruit from the Caribbean to Dover. The vessel encountered a force 10 storm about 200 miles off southern Ireland during the day and lost about 90 containers with bananas and other fruit in them. During the storm the captain sustained serious spinal and internal injuries, Falmouth Coastguard said. Two passengers on board were also less seriously hurt - one with a broken hand and another with head injuries. It appeared those injured were trying to fasten the containers in the storm. The helicopter from RAF Chivenor in Devon, assisted by a Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft from Scotland, spent nearly an hour over the ship trying to get the injured man off. Squadron Leader Barry Neilson told Sky News: \"The crew of the helicopter from RAF Chivenor have spent the best part of an hour trying to get their crewmen onto the vessel, but it is moving around so much in the high seas they have been unable to do that safely. They have now assessed that it's safer for the master to remain where he is.\" The captain will now remain on board the ship as it sails to Cork, and transfer to hospital on arrival. It is thought it could take until tomorrow lunchtime to complete this journey. Up to six other people - thought to be passengers - also wanted to leave the ship. Falmouth Coastguard watch manager John Rossiter said: \"The conditions are too poor and it's too dangerous at the moment to carry out the operation. \"The Sea King is returning to Cork and there will be a reassessment of the operation at first light.\" The coastguard said the vessel also suffered some damage and it was listing slightly but there is no danger of it sinking. The exact circumstances of how the captain suffered his injuries is unknown. Earlier, rescue teams airlifted 37 people to safety off the British coast after two ships ran aground in stormy seas. A helicopter and lifeboat were scrambled from Stornoway, on the Isle of Lewis, after receiving a distress call from a trawler that ran aground off St Kilda, in the Hebrides, in force nine gales. Coastguards winched all 14 of the Spinning Dale's crew to safety at around 9am. Two were suffering from mild hypothermia and another had a cut hand. The British-registered boat, which has a Spanish crew, was taking on water, a coastguard spokeswoman said. Last night, 23 people were winched to safety from a stricken ferry when it ran aground off the north-west coast of England in rough weather. Helicopters from the RAF, Royal Navy and Irish Coastguard were scrambled to rescue the Riverdance's passengers and crew off the coast of Fleetwood, Lancashire, after it was hit by a huge wave in 60mph winds. The vessel was carrying four passengers and 19 crew when its cargo shifted and it started listing at 60 degrees at around 7.30pm yesterday. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution, which sent boats from Fleetwood and Lytham St Annes to help, described the conditions as \"horrendous\". Those airlifted to safety were taken to Blackpool airport to recover and be assessed for injuries. The stricken vessel was today stranded around 200 metres off the north shore of Blackpool beach. \"Our main concern now is any pollution or problems that could occur,\" Mark Clark, of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, said. \"We do need to find out what kind of oils were on board.\" A spokesman for Seatruck Ferries, which operates Riverdance, said the vessel was carrying trucks and trailers from Warrenpoint, in Northern Ireland, to the Lancashire port of Heysham."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
