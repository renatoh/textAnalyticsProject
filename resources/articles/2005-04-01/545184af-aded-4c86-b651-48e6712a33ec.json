The FTSE 100 closed 33.6 points lower at 4,822, its lowest finish since January 24, as investors decided to sit on the sidelines and keep their powder dry. Following last week's sell-off, traders reckon institutions - and, for that matter, hedge funds - are in something of a conundrum. Put simply, they do not know whether the recent weakness is a sign of things to come or a great opportunity to buy equities. As a result they are doing nothing, and will probably continue to do nothing until the picture becomes clearer. Of course, that will not happen until more economic data is published, and meanwhile traders will be forced to mark stocks lower in order to drum up a bit of business. That said, a number of other factors also weighed on the FTSE 100 yesterday. A poor performance from life assurer Prudential, which fell 18p to 485p after first-quarter figures proved disappointing, did not help. Nor did weakness in the hedge fund manager Man Group, which fell 37p to \u00a312.82 as dealers had their first chance to react to news that the value of its key AHL fund dropped 2.52% last week. In addition to that, several heavyweight stocks traded ex-dividend. These included Tesco, down 9p to 314.25p, BAE Systems, off 6.5p at 255p, and Old Mutual, 3.25p lighter at 124.75p. Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 index faded 17.4 points to 6,981.7, while the FTSE Small Cap added 2.9 points to close at 2,872.8. In the bond market, the benchmark 10-year gilt closed at around 101.310, yielding 4.588%. Unsurprisingly, market turnover was lacklustre, with only about 2.7bn shares changing hands over the day. InterContinental Hotels Group managed to buck the weak market trend, rising 13.5p to 633p. Traders said the stock had been lifted by a recent research note from Citigroup Smith Barney, which argued the company was undervalued. The supermarket chain William Morrison rose 0.25p to 205p on a heavy volume of 55m shares. Analysts reckon short-sellers are buying back their positions following rumours of a management shake-up and in the wake of news that Brandes, the US value investor, has added to its holding, which is now at 9.3%. But the clothing retailer Next fell 20p to close at \u00a315.24. According to traders, the company has been making cautious noises about the consumer spending outlook in recent meetings with City institutions. Among the mid caps, Egg, the internet bank, faded 1.25p to 102.75p after CSFB cut its target price to 80p and warned that next week's first-quarter figures could prove disappointing and spark earnings downgrades of 15%. Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant bank currently in takeover talks with its biggest shareholder - Iceland's Kaupthing Bank - gained 4.75p to 307p. Traders said the shares had been artificially depressed during Tuesday's closing auction, the process by which the stock exchange sets closing prices. The stock was also supported by talk that Kaupthing is preparing to make an offer for 345p for the 80.5% of S&amp;F it does not already own. Among the small caps, Jessops, the camera and photographic supplies retailer, sank to a record low of 84.25p, down 3p. Its private equity backer, ABN Amro Capital, will be free to sell its 18% stake from May 3. But with Jessops languishing well below last autumn's 155p flotation price, many traders reckon it will sit on its holding for a bit longer in the hope of an improvement in the price. Wyevale Garden Centres, Britain's largest garden centre operator, marked time at 477.5p, despite the appearance on its share register of Trefick, the investment vehicle of the property entrepreneur Jack Petchey, with a 3.83% holding. Three weeks ago, WGC appointed Strutt &amp; Parker to undertake a review of its 74 freehold sites with a view to establishing their value and whether they can be developed for alternative uses. Traders also pointed out that WGC holds its annual shareholder meeting next Wednesday and that Laxey Partners, an aggressive value investor, has built a 16.3% holding in the company. Elementis, the pigments and chromium group, was marked 3p higher at 50p, also on stake-building rumours. Value investor Hanover Partners has amassed a 15.2% holding in the company. Bioquell, the bio-decontamination specialist, rose 8p, or 7%, to 123.5p after three non-executive directors, of whom one was the chairman, Richard Salkeld, declared the purchase of stock worth about \u00a3140,000. Homestyle, the home furnishing group that sold its Rosebys division to a management buyout team last year, improved 0.5p to 91p after the company pointed out that it did not have concessions in Allders stores. It does, however, operate a number in Debenhams department stores. On Aim, Timestrip, the \"smart\" food labelling specialist, moved up 0.375p to 3p ahead of the Interpack trade fair in Germany next week, at which the company will launch its Lifetime Cap in partnership with the German group Crown Zeller. Finally, keep an eye on Trading Emissions. Following a \u00a3135m fundraising by Numis Securities, its shares are expected to start trading at 100p this morning, and dealers are tipping it as one to watch. The hedge fund Moore Capital Europe is a 14.8% shareholder. Major task for Minorplanet The vehicle-tracking specialist Minorplanet dragged itself some way out of the mire yesterday as it completed its long-awaited interim financing. The company has raised just over half a million pounds from institutional investors through a placing at 5p a share. Minorplanet has also persuaded GE Capital Equity Holdings and the chief executive, Terry Donovan, to lend the firm up to a further \u00a32m. The company made it plain, however, that GE had no intention of lending any cash after that so Minorplanet will still need to put together a further fundraising by the end of June. With that in mind, Minorplanet said it had undertaken some initial \"positive\" discussions with institutional investors, who may back a larger equity fundraising. The shares rose 0.75p to 4.5p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
