Subs: Carroll, Beckham, Chadwick, Solskjaer, Wallwork, Fortune, O'Shea. Boavista Ricardo, Frechaut, Pedro Emanuel, Turra, Erivan, Sanchez, Petit, Alexandre, Jorge Silva, Duda, Silva. Subs: William, Rui Oscar, Marcio Santos, Martelinho, Pedro Santos, Loja, Glauber. Referee Antonio Jesus Lopez Nieto (Malaga) 1 United get things under way, minus Beckham, against the side that committed the most fouls in the first stage. Silvestre and Duda already clashing in the air as Boavista makje early inroads. 3 A long hoof upfield towards Yorke, but Frechaut hangs on to Yorke like a limpet and is penalised. 5 Nice feet and a tidy turn to shakle off the attentions of two United players on the Boavista left; shoots from distance straight at Barthez. 6 Silvestre gets up well and wins a corner on United's left. Veron takes and misses everyone. 7 Duda away in space on the right, shoots with his right and forces a flailing Barthez to do what he does worst and make a fine save. 11 Another corner to United; Veron again the man, but Silva gets up to prevent Blanc from getting his head in. 12 Great chance for Scholes with a half-volley just inside the areaz - goes for a corner that Beckham takes. Comes to nothing. Fairly open stuff up to now with United starting to assert themselves, but Boavista looking dangerous on the break. 14 Free-kick to United 25 yards out; Veron takes - just wide of the Boavista keeper Ricardo's left stick. 17 Yorke sells Keane short in the middle and the Irishman gets booked for directing his frustration at the referee. 23 Corner to United after Silvestre gets away on the left before switching play to the right with Keane; a little dummy takes Keane to the by-line but Erivan's tackle is spot on. Veron aims his corner at the near post - easy for Boavista. 25 Silva has a good wriggle on the ground after succombing to a tackle by Scholes. 27 Free-kick to Boavista; falls to Duda for him to shoot at an imaginary goal. 28 Good pressure by Boavista for a corner; Petit plays it deep but United pile out and cancel the threat. 31 A looping ball into the area has United scuttling; it hangs there, teasing van Nistelrooy 32 GOAL: Manchester United 1 - 0 Boavista Phil Neville picks it up on the right, plays a one-two with Veron on the edge of the area, before van Nistelrooy takes over and opens the scoring with a tap in from 10 yards. 38 Silvestre having a stormer on the left as he charges off again; only stopped when he runs into Jorge Silva. 40 Scholes with a lovely ball to release Yorke on the left. Only Yorke will know why he spurned an early shooting chance, faffed around and then lost possession. 42 Butt unlucky not get on the end of Keane's cross into the area. 42 Boavista free-kick from all of 35 yards; drops it into the area for United to clear. United then break with van Nistelrooy covering 60 yards before losing possession in the Boavista area. All ends in a corner; Veron takes, comes to nothing. 45 The half ends with a half-chance for Boavista that at least gives Barthez a chance to hold the ball. Definitely United's 45; they got a goal after all. Boavista not causing Barthez much grief, but then he is quite capable of doing that himself. The visitors are still lively but now not quite so willing to pile up on a whim. 46 Here we go again, with Boavista starting the second half. 47 Huge cock-up by Boavista; Alexandre gets into the area after finding space, the ball runs ahead of him and Duda, quite reasonably as it was running towards him, takes it as his chance but they get on top of each other when Alexandre continues his run; United clear. Should have been the equaliser. 49 Corner to United; Veron takes and Boavista clear. 53 Booking Scholes, for coming in from behind. Now only one away from suspension. 54 Boavista appear to have recovered from the slight dose of the blues that hit then towards the end of the first half and pressure United's area with a glancing header from Alexandre 55 GOAL: Man Utd 2 - 0 Boavista Veron places his corner bang on the utterly unmarked Blanc's head for the Frenchman to score his first goal for United, from 10 yards. 58 Substitution Marcio Santos on for Silva. 61 Substitution Martelinho on for Jorge Silva. 62 GOAL: Man Utd 3 - 0 Boavista United break with Yorke on the right; Yorke slides the ball through to a waiting van Nistelrooy ahead of him and the Dutchman measures his approach perfectly to score with a right-foot shot at the far post. 66 Any confidence that Boavista regained during half-time has now well and truly been smashed out of them and there is a serious risk that they could come apart completely. 68 But they have a free-kick 20 yards out, slightly to their right - just a shame for them that Sanchez decided to spoon it into the crowd. 69 Substitution Pedro Santos on for Sanchez. 72 Great work by van Nistelrooy to hold the ball up in the area before laying it off to Veron just outside him but the Argentine's cross from the by-line is gathered wirth ease by Ricardo. 74 Booking Pedro Emanuel for a shove on Butt. Hands United a free-kick 30 yards out, but Veron send it high into the crowd. 77 Erivan surprised to find the ball at his feet on the edge of the area from a Martelinho cross. On another night his shot might have gone inside Barthez's right stick and not a couple of yards wide. Substitution O'Shea on for Gary Neville. 81 Good build-up by Boavista with a combination of passes that opens up the United area, but the final shot is lacking. 84 Martelinho tries a blatent dive in the 18-yard box but at least has the good grace to come clean with a beaming smile. The ref also seems to have seen the funny side. 85 Substitution Fortune on for Scholes, who immediately scuttles off the dressing room. 87 United corner, comes out to Butt who grazes the bar from distance. 88 Substitution Solskjaer on for van Nistelrooy. 90 Boavista free-kick 20 yards out; Petit rifles it through the wall and Barthez gets down well to claim. Full-time.That should have put a smile back on Sir Alex Ferguson's face - great game for van Nistelrooy, Blanc and captain Veron and three points to take on to the next game against Nantes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
