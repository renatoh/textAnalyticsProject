Only 27 bathrooms?", "bodyText": "This can't be an easy time for homeowners struggling with a sluggish property market. So let's spare a thought for their pain. Real people are suffering. Now we've done that, go find a wall \u2013 or an estate agent or a financial adviser \u2013 to punch as you take in the details of one house currently unable to find a buyer. This \u00a370m mansion provides the backdrop to the greatest tale of our times. It was once the UK's most expensive house, bought by a British-born property mogul for \u00a320m in 2001. Last week came reports that the Irish government is on the verge of seizing it. One visitor describes it as \"an abandoned Dubai hotel crossed with a cruise ship\". Forget the house that Jack built. This is the house that Midas built. He was wearing the emperor's new clothes at the time. And a big gold crown that made his brain stop working. One analysis says it all: \"A luxury home designed by British architects, using Italian builders, financed by overstretched Irish bankers \u2013 all in the vain hope of snaring Arab, Russian and Far East buyers.\" Vain indeed. It's been on the market for seven years. Seven years! It couldn't even sell itself at the height of the property madness when a Russian would spend millions on a shoebox in Knightsbridge. What hope for it in these globally reduced circumstances? The scale of folly here is as mind-blowing as the proportions of the house are unimaginable. It's like Southfork in Dallas by way of Mr Creosote. It can barely be contained by a wide-angle aerial view. It's a comedy vision of a comedy rich person's home. At ground level, you will find 250 tons of Italian marble and 58 acres of landscaped gardens. In the basement, you will find a panic room with its own air-conditioning system. The panic room is at least useful. After seven years on the market, the owner must hang out in it quite a lot, if not literally then metaphorically. (He said last week: \"With the benefit of hindsight, I would have run a million miles.\") There's an underground squash court and two indoor swimming pools. There's a quarter of a mile of under-driveway heating. Under-driveway! There are 103 rooms, including \u2013 best of all \u2013 27 bathrooms. I love the 27 bathrooms. They make me feel very clean. Surely no one is so dirty that they need 27 bathrooms? Of course, I can't answer that question as I've never met anyone from the Chipping Norton set. But maybe there is some kind of bathroom-related mathematical differential only wealthy people know about. Like, the bigger the risk you take on your mortgage, the more \"wet rooms\" you have to build in order to appease your conscience. We haven't even got to the best thing about this house. It's called Updown Court. Priceless. First it went up. Now the owner's a bit down. As such, it stands for everything that went wrong in the last 20 years: a big, fat, vulgar dream of ambition and delusion, built on promises, false hope and loans from the Irish Nationwide Building Society. Poor old Updown, a metaphor for unbridled greed. A lesson. Or is it? As Updown experiences its comeuppance, let's look at what's happening elsewhere. A sober stock-take of property values, an analysis of the ethics of the banking system and a debate about the redistribution of wealth, perhaps? No, that would be silly. Instead, the NHS is being dismantled, the public sector is being squeezed and in many areas house prices are still going up, up, up. Hurrah! Updown is no longer even one of the most expensive houses in the land. Oh, no. You have to top \u00a3100m to get into that bracket now. A flat recently sold in London for \u00a3135.4m. In \"Recession Britain\", there are 5,922 streets around the country where the average house costs \u00a31m. (\"House\"? \"Average\"? I am hanging out with the wrong crowd.) The comedown of Updown is a parable for our times. But on millionaire's row(s), they're still singing the same old song. Altogether now for the Updown theme tune. It's specially commissioned and comes complete with vocal cord heating system. Just cover your ears and sing along: \"La la la la la la.\" The opposite of denial is going on in Eric Fischer's geo-location maps of Twitter and Flickr activity around the world. In fact, perhaps they are the ultimate definition of \"too much information\". But who cares, they're fascinating. Fischer, a self-confessed \"geek of maps\", has found a way to generate visual representations of who is tweeting and taking photographs anywhere in the world. Tweeting shows up most in Britain, North America, the Netherlands and Japan. The places where people are most likely to take pictures and post them on Flickr? Iceland, Scotland, New Zealand and game reserves in Africa. The maps don't tell us anything we couldn't have guessed. City centres are bright with frenzied social networking and photo-sharing. But Fischer's babies are unexpectedly heart-warming. They remind you of a moment that never becomes boring: when you land late at night in a city airport, take in the lights below you and feel glad to be alive. While the usual fleshpots are lit up with tweets and shared snapshots \u2013 New York, London, Tokyo, Beijing \u2013 95% of the globe is shrouded in blissful, internet-free darkness. Take note, anyone planning a proper holiday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
