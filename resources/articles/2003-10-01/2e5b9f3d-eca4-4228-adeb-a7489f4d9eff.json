Tomorrow, the background will be invisible to a crowd who have eyes only for the collision of Rangers and Manchester United. Even the tournament itself is a secondary consideration. This is to be a night of atavistic impulses as the oldest of football rivalries is renewed and facts will be allowed no influences on the emotions. It is perfectly possible that the sole Scot on the field will be in Manchester United's colours, if Darren Fletcher is pardoned his weak display at Elland Road on Saturday. That, however, will not dilute the perception that Scotland and England are confronting each other once more. Passports will not be inspected too closely by the fans so long as honour is satisfied. One of the richest memories of relatively modern times for the Rangers supporters came 11 years ago when Leeds United were beaten home and away in the European Cup, even if it was the Englishman Mark Hateley who hit one of the important goals at Elland Road. These encounters, however, are regrettably intermittent. For the most part, one of the richest resources in British football is no longer tapped. Neighbours vie with one another by nature and the first official international match in the world took place at Hamilton Crescent in Glasgow when Scotland faced England in 1872. The nations grappled with one another fervently for well over 100 years before the fixture started to sour. The smaller country was always jabbering and yelling, to convince itself of its worth as much as to unnerve the opposition. Nonetheless, England were at least as committed, even if decorum and an awareness of their advantages made bragging unseemly. Sir Alf Ramsey's desire to overcome Scotland was boundless, despite the frostiness that concealed searing emotions. The tale of the fixture was one in which passion slowly became sinister. Terry Venables has a merry tale about travelling to Hampden Park with a friend in the 1960s. When the car they had booked failed to appear to take them back into town, the pair then had to make a long, wordless walk back through the Gorbals, keeping their lips sealed in case their accents betrayed them. The hint of menace did not remain comic for much longer. The Tartan Army is remorselessly friendly nowadays, but far too many Scots who made the journey to Wembley in the 1970s were vile in their conduct and Londoners sympathised when the Underground staff went on strike in protest. Before the contest expired as an annual affair, it was Glasgow's turn to be stricken as National Front members travelled to Hampden. While Adam Crozier was chief executive of the FA, he was reported to have discussed resuscitating the fixture with his opposite number at the SFA. It was an initiative that inevitably petered out. Fans are almost antagonistic to the idea of friendlies nowadays and, more significantly, the FA, fearful of being banished by Uefa for crowd misconduct, can no longer contemplate facing Scotland by choice. If the duel is to continue at all, it is the clubs who will have to maintain it. They are capable of conjuring up distinctive contests with an appeal that refreshes even jaded appetites. The repetitiveness of the Champions League has ensured a bored response by couch potatoes and spectators alike to many of the meetings between prestigious clubs around the continent. By contrast, you could sense a welling excitement for a Uefa Cup tie last season when Five paid Celtic more than \u00a32m for the rights to the first leg with Liverpool on the correct assumption that their audience share would enjoy an energetic upsurge. The simplest means of sustaining these cross-border games would be to admit the Old Firm to the Premiership, but the prospects of that happening have waned. It might be easier to overcome Uefa objections if Scottish and English clubs were to mingle on the intermittent basis of a knockout competition. The beleaguered status of the FA Cup and the Scottish Cup would be strengthened by new enthusiasm if those competitions merged for the closing phases, with the last four in each country gathering as quarter-finalists. Conflict and fury is inevitable tomorrow, but Rangers can also mount a charm offensive on English viewers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
