Something very odd. Maybe I'm dreaming. Suddenly, I feel a second brush, this time against my legs and I'm sure it's more of a scamper than a brush. I pa nic, jump out of bed and fling back the pink nylon sheets to reveal a 10-inch mubuya maculata , better known as a lizard to you and me. I shouldn't really be surprised. This is Fernando de Noronha, a group of 21 islets off the coast of north-east Brazil, with some of the strictest rules in the world to keep touris m numbers down to a bare minimum and wildlife flourishing to the full. There are animals everywhere. Hundreds of spinner dolphins play in the bays and stingrays greet you as you snorkel in the Atlantic. Lizards dart everywhere. Every time I feel a wriggle on my toes it's yet another mubuya maculata . At one point there are 10 in conference at my sandy feet, plus a local mouse. The islands are grand, green and mountainous with yellow sand fringes. Having once been volcanic they aren't the pretty, turquoise, paradise images associated with the Maldives or Bahamas, but rocky masses with attitude. This is a shock to me. I'm looking forward to the 16 untouched beaches. A band of male divers all with hairy wrists with watches the size of bricks and wearing matching black T-shirts are more fascinated by the underwater sea turtles, octopuses and jewfish and finding out about the 14 species of shark that inhabit the waters. While islands around the world are knocking up luxury resorts, this is a place where nature stays as it is. The guardian of these islands is Ibama, the environmental protection agency that administers Brazil's national parks. Until 1987 Brazil's armed forces had a base here. When they pulled out, discussions raged about building luxury resorts and golf courses. After a huge battle between environmentalists and the government, the eco-warriors won and Fernando was decreed a national park. Only 420 tourists can stay in Fernando per night (that's the size of one hotel in other parts of the world). When that number is reached, you go on a waiting list with the tour companies that go there. You also have to pay an eco-tax in cash in the arrivals hall (or rather shed) to get in, ranging from \u00a37 for one night to \u00a3585 for a month. You are financially encouraged not to outstay your welcome. I scan a big booklet of rules handed to me at the airport. They include: no swimming with dolphins; no access to beaches between 6pm and 8am, no camping, no feeding animals and the one that really catches my eye - no footwear or suntan cream on Atalaia Beach (to protect marine life). We jump into a beach buggy taxi which scrambles up a dusty hill, round a bend and into a clearing where most of the 420 people staying the night have gathered. Many are draped on rocks, gazing into the bay with jagged mountains behind, waiting for the big show sunset. It's only six o'clock. In minutes, people turn into silhouettes and one by one get back into their buggies (the only transport, which is limited, of course) and roar away. We are staying in Casa das Pedras, which is a stone self-catering house, up a dusty road in the most populated part of Fernando. That said, there is nothing much there other than a few small houses with decks at the front, a few rooms to rent at the back and a small hall where weekly eco-lectures are held. Back at the house the fridge is bare. The road is dark (no street lighting in paradise) and no restaurants in sight. No supermarkets either. And absolutely no humans. My husband, Markus, goes out hunting for food and a 20-minute walk later finds the only pizzeria in town. I fall asleep hungry. The windows smeared with salt water stains rattle in the wind and the bed's sponge mattress has seen better days. We wake up with the dawn. There's a small frog in the bathroom sink (this sort of thing is no longer a surprise). If you like your creature comforts, this is not the place for you. There's only one hotel - a corrugated iron ex-army barracks - and a bunch of basic B&amp;Bs run by locals. It's impossible to get a decent meal. Most meals consist of a few bits of locally caught fish and a pile of salad stuff from tins. But the payoff for keeping tourism small is pristine beaches and clear underwater diving (up to 50 metres). And the locals benefit directly from tourism by being the sole providers of food, beds and taxis. Just three registered companies run the diving. We go down to the island's busiest beach, Praia do Cachorro, where local kids run in the sand and jump in the waves. This is not a good place to feel thirsty - no beach huts serving cocktails here. But the view is wonderful. We explore the island - driving down dusty tracks lined with coloured dustbins for rubbish separation and notices telling you not to throw litter. We come out on to a beautiful beach, Praia do Le\u00e3o. A woman called Eliane is standing under a beach shade with an ice box and a cake with a mosquito cover. We gratefully buy a couple of cans of ice-cold Guarana (the Brazilian national fizzy drink) and a piece of cake. 'There is no unemployment here,' she says. 'Everyone does something. Fishing, cooking, running B&amp;Bs. I bake cakes.' She loves it here. 'You can leave the door unlocked, nobody steals anything.' Commit a crime and you are deported. 'One guy who was high on marijuana once robbed the island shop. He was on the next flight out of here, banned forever.' The next day we try the famed Atalaia Beach. It's obviously rush hour on Fernando. A long queue of beach buggies with bronzed girls in skimpy bikinis hanging off the backs wait patiently in front of a tiny caravan with a countdown sign saying how many visitors can still enter (daily quota is 100 people). Eventually our buggy is let in, we drive down a dirt track where we park and walk down to the beach. An Ibama policeman blows his whistle, orders us to abandon our flip-flops and tiptoe to the small natural water swimming pools in the sand, blocked off from the sea by natural rocks. The Ibama guard blows again and barks commands: 'No stepping on that area!' 'Do not touch the coral.' He picks up a handful of soggy sand, whips out a magnifying glass and beckons us forward. Through the glass are huge lumps of pink coral. He picks up a tiny shell - inside is a crab-like creature called Arat\u00fa, the size of a finger nail. He places it back on the sand and the shell scampers away. Lying face forward with a snorkel, I look into the pool, my shoulders fully exposed to the sun - no suntan lotion is allowed, it might kill the fish, says Mr Ibama - and cruise the ocean bed. The reef is full of huge fish, shoals of purple finned, silver ones, electric green ones, stripy black and yellow ones. Suddenly the mirage is interrupted by the screech of a whistle. 'All out.' As I walk across the sand, a huge multicoloured crab scurries to my feet and inspects me before scurrying off. I watch the other groups leaving the beach, a group from Argentina and a couple and their two children from Sao Paulo brimming with the kind of excitement normally associated with illegal substances. And I realise that although I'm no animal lover, I just had the best date of my life with nature. Two days later, back on mainland Brazil, I unpack my rucksack in a new hotel room, the choking traffic of Recife humming in the background. The adjustment to civilisation is hard. Strange, green, slimy stuff covers my clothes. It's everywhere. It looks like some kind of animal excrement. And then out of the corner of my eye, I notice something. A very familiar Fernando mubuya maculata darts out of my luggage.
