Cunningham escaped suspension at a disciplinary hearing last night after being put on report for a clash with Pat Richards in last Friday's Super League derby against Wigan. He had been charged with striking by the Rugby Football League, which would have led to a ban, but was found guilty only of the lesser offence of \"misconduct for making contact with an opponent's head\" and fined \u00a3300. The Saints coach, Daniel Anderson, confirmed that the 30-year-old hooker will captain the cup holders at the Galpharm Stadium on Saturday despite Sean Long's return to the starting team. Bradford's coach, Steve McNamara, revealed that the Bulls have ruled out a return for Vainikolo, who began a three-year union contract with Gloucester earlier this month, after a discussion led by his former team-mates. \"I felt it was right and proper that the players had some part in making this decision,\" he said. \"We all love Lesley to bits and know that he would have been an addition to the squad but the right decision was made.\" Thomas Bosc will miss Catalans Dragons' semi-final against Wigan on Sunday The goalkicking wing has a broken arm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
