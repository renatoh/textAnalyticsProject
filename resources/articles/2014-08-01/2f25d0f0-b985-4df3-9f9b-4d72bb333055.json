None. Nada. Zip. Zilch. There are currently no legal requirements for election advertising to tell the truth. It is, however, an issue that does get raised from time to time. In fact, in 1984 a regulation was brought in: A person shall not, during the relevant period in relation to an election under this Act, print, publish, or distribute, or cause, permit or authorise to be printed, published or distributed, any electoral advertisement containing a statement: 1. That is untrue; and 2. That is, or is likely to be, misleading or deceptive. It was repealed six months later. The reason? The Committee found that political advertising involves concepts, ideas, policies and images (often contested by the opposing parties) which cannot be subjected to a test of truth, truth itself being inherently difficult to define. It was also concerned that decisions as to whether a political statement is \u201ctrue\u201d would necessarily involve a political judgment, based upon political premises, which an impartial body would be poorly placed to adjudicate in. The shorter version of that is: \u201cToo damn hard.\u201d The United States also has no regulations for truth in electoral advertising because it is seen as a breach of the right to free speech and therefore constitutionally unsound. And even though we don\u2019t technically have freedom of speech in our constitution, our high court recognises the Australian constitution contains an implied freedom of political discussion. However, the fact that South Australia has a provision for truth in advertising, and that it has survived legal challenges in court, suggests it is actually possible to regulate truth in political advertising. I think the problem is that no one wants to be responsible for such a political hot potato. Because of the limited length of our election campaigns, any claims of untruth would have to be dealt with immediately in a highly volatile atmosphere with huge political ramifications and, no doubt, accusations of bias. The Advertising Standards Bureau (ASB), which regulates the rest of advertising, suggests that taking on the role would expose them to implications of political bias. The ASB won\u2019t even weigh in as to whether or not an election ad is offensive. This is in part because the ASB no doubt sees that vexatious complaints could and would be made by both parties, and it may end up being a minefield\u2014the ASB is, after all, industry regulated and simply doesn\u2019t need the hassle. The following paragraph on the ASB website, however, suggests they may reconsider if the government decides to throw some money their way! Complainants should be aware that the ASB is an industry funded body. It is inappropriate for the ASB to assume jurisdiction over the content of political advertising in the absence of government support for such advertising to be regulated. It\u2019s only when ads get very personal (what used to be referred to as \u201cpolitical dynamiting\u201d in the old days) that there is the possibility of legal action through the various defamation laws. But while you can sue if you believe you have been defamed in an election ad, the problem is that any legal action is a lengthy process. The judgment wouldn\u2019t get the ad off TV until well after the election was done and dusted and the damage inflicted. In 2012, Ted Baillieu sued the ALP campaign director Nick Reece for an ad that implied Baillieu, as a former director of real estate company Baillieu Knight Frank, had profited from the sale of some schools and hospitals under former premier Jeff Kennett. The ALP refused to withdraw the ad and it continued to run. The following year the case was settled out of court by an apology from Reece (but with no damages or costs paid). But because the station which runs the ad is also at risk of liability for defamation, there is a mechanism in place that really does stop the most defamatory ads going to air: CAD, the Commercials Advice arm of free TV. Every single ad that goes to air on free TV has to go through CAD first. CAD assesses and requires substantiation for claims in ads, like \u201c25% more power\u201d, \u201cenvironmentally friendly\u201d, \u201cthe world\u2019s biggest/smallest/ fastest\u201d. Or even \u201cnew\u201d (you only get a few months to call a product \u201cnew\u201d before you have to drop the word from your ads). But with political advertising, CAD limits its role to the assessment of personal claims made in the ad. Before an ad goes to air, CAD will assess whether it contains anything that is defamatory or false about a person\u2019s character, and if it thinks the ad does, you have to be able to substantiate the claim before the ad goes to air. Since many election ads go to the heart of the character of an opposing candidate, waiting for CAD approval can be one of the most stressful times in a campaign\u2014particularly when it\u2019s nearing 5pm on a Friday and the ad has to be dispatched literally in minutes to make its deadline. So generally you make sure you have every possible piece of substantiation on hand just in case. I don\u2019t recall ever having an ad refused by CAD, although occasionally some changes have had to be made before an ad went to air. Creatives don\u2019t write ads to be deliberately untruthful, despite what people may think! We try to fight hard but fair. Although that\u2019s not to say that sometimes, in the heat of a campaign, we don\u2019t go too far. Both sides do it. But while everyone is entitled to their own opinion, everyone is not entitled to their own facts. And it is a complete own goal in an election campaign to tell a blatant lie. The public isn\u2019t stupid, and the media also has its own ways of dealing with it. Some of the most popular websites last election were fact-checking sites such as PolitiFact Australia (since closed until commercial funding is secured\u2014hopefully in time for the next election), which checks the veracity of claims made in ads. And often false claims make the TV news. Being caught red-handed does you far more damage than the misinformation does your opponent. Before the 2007 federal election the husband of Jackie Kelly, the Liberal MP for Lindsay, was identified handing out bogus leaflets falsely claiming to be from the Islamic Australia Federation. The leaflets stated that Labor would support a new mosque in St Marys and wanted \u201cour Muslim brothers\u201d to be forgiven for the Bali bombings. A clue that there was something amiss was in the fact the phrase, Allahu Akbar (\u201cGod is great\u201d, in Arabic), was misspelled. The ramifications were huge. Not only did they cost Jackie her seat, but it was considered to have had a significant impact on the ethnic vote across Sydney, contributing to the loss of John Howard\u2019s own seat of Bennelong. Veracity aside, there are some rules for TV ads around the use of footage; for example, you are not allowed to use ABC or parliamentary footage. But, bizarrely, most of the regulations about TV election ads centre around those three seconds at the end that no one pays any attention to\u2014the authorisation tag in which you hear a voice-over say, as quickly as humanly possible, \u201cSpoken and authorised by ...\u201d while you see a black screen with white text with all the relevant authorisation information that has never been actually read by anyone except the people whose job it is to check it conforms to the vast amount of regulations around it (which include how the text is laid out, and even the amount of silence required afterwards\u20140.5 seconds, in case you\u2019re wondering). As part of their public information charters, both SBS and the ABC are required to provide the main political parties with free broadcast time. The rules and regulations around this stretch for about fourteen pages \u2013 which, coincidentally, corresponds to the number of people who actually watch the broadcasts. The ABC gives each major party just over thirty minutes of free time on ABC1 Television and on ABC Local Radio, made up of 12 ninety-second policy announcements, and around thirteen minutes for the final pitch. Minor parties, if they qualify, get two lots of 90 seconds each. The internet has largely been a regulation-free zone, but that is starting to change. Regardless, anything that comes from the political parties themselves has to follow the same guidelines, including authorisations, as any other election material. The same goes for printed materials. In addition, election materials cannot be put on public space, which means no advertising on billboards or buildings or infrastructure owned by the state or federal governments, including train stations and buses. Most of the other regulations that exist concern the polling day itself. In a federal election, parties aren\u2019t allowed to canvass for votes within 6 metres of an election booth, or broadcast material that can be heard within the 6 metres. Tony Abbott once had to change a t-shirt he was wearing because it contravened the regulations. The final regulation concerned with political advertising is a relic that needs to be thrown out, in my opinion. The blackout period\u2014which refers to the three-day period prior to the election when no TV or radio ads are allowed\u2014was supposed to give voters cooling-off time in which they could make up their own mind without being unduly influenced by advertising. But with the advent of the internet, which is where people are increasingly consuming news and marketing materials, it is a rule that is simply out of date. Clive Palmer got around the blackout period rather brilliantly in the 2013 federal election. He didn\u2019t run any TV or radio ads for the Palmer United Party (PUP) in the last three days, because that would have contravened the regulations. He did, however, run a hell of a lot of ads for Clive Palmer\u2019s Coolum Resort! \u2022 This is an extract from Dee Madigan\u2019s latest book, The Hard Sell"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
