City will regain top spot from Liverpool on Wednesday night on goal difference if they win at Everton, albeit having played a game more, and Guardiola knows the margin could be slim in the final analysis. His team\u2019s goal difference is five better than Liverpool\u2019s and superior to Tottenham\u2019s by 14. Roberto Mancini\u2019s City side won the title on goal difference from Manchester United in 2012. \u201cThe first message is to win the game and the second one is if you can score, score, and if you can avoid conceding, do it,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cThe Premier League could go to goal difference, I agree, though we are not going to say to the guys: \u2018Today we have to win 25-zero.\u2019 I have never said that. First you have to win the game and then second try [to score more], because it can happen.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s last two results have been draws, J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team spurning the chance to pull seven points ahead of City. Guardiola, asked whether he felt reassured that his players have experience of winning the title, said: \u201cI think [your] question is whether Liverpool can handle the pressure or not \u2013 really I don\u2019t know. \u201cWhat I would say is that I trust my players because, and I use this example always, we were 3-0 down in the Champions League at Anfield [last season] and the reaction when we played them in the second leg \u2026 when we scored a legal goal [Leroy San\u00e9\u2019s effort was incorrectly ruled out for offside] and an incredible penalty in the second half via Andy Robertson on Raheem Sterling [which was not given]. \u201cThe way we reacted and the way we [proceeded] to play despite all of this \u2013 that\u2019s good. The only moment in the last two seasons when we lost back-to-back league games was this season against Crystal Palace and Leicester [in December]. I have the feeling that when I put them under pressure they react well. They accept the challenge when I say: \u2018OK, show me again how good you are, come on.\u2019 And they do it, they try it.\u201d But Guardiola believes Klopp\u2019s men have the advantage. He said: \u201cI would prefer to be in the position of Liverpool. Yesterday after the result [the 1-1 draw at West Ham] we were surprised, but it can happen. \u201cThey drop two points and it is better for us than the position before. OK, the [other] teams will have a rest and Everton and ourselves have to play on Wednesday. But we have to win. Are we going to be the team that lost against Newcastle or the team that won against Arsenal? That is the challenge. \u201cThree or four days ago we were already done, the champions were Liverpool and now we can be leading. We try to be calm. There will be surprises and it will be tough for teams to win every game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
