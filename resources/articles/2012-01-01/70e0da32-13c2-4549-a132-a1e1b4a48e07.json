The obnoxiously foppish Drood is dispatched fairly early on, having repulsed one and all \u2013 in particular John Jasper, the local choirmaster, who's in love with Drood's fiancee Rosa Bud. With his insomniac sufferings and rages, the otherwise decent Jasper (Matthew Rhys) is the most interesting character, among the usual Dickens staples of cheeky urchins, cackling crones and gnarly types who refer to themselves constantly in the third person. David Stubbs Rogue Baboon: An Inside Nature's Giants Special 9pm, Channel 4 The show that turned animal dissection into primetime viewing is on an anatomical mission: to show us why animals are like they are, why they do what they do, and why they live where they live, from the inside out. Tonight's special sees hosts Mark Evans and Joy Reidenberg travel to South Africa to observe a recently deceased alpha male baboon that had become increasingly violent. Just how similar are these creatures to human beings? John Robinson Arena: Dickens on Film 10pm, BBC4 As the excellent recent BBC adaptation of Great Expectations proves, the work of Charles Dickens has always been a natural fit for big- and small-screen conversion. Dickens's work is often described as \"cinematic\" in outlook, but it's difficult to qualify exactly what makes his work so easily transferable to film and television. As part of the celebrations of his 200th birthday, Arena scours the archives for some of the most memorable Dickens adaptations, from early silent-era work to modern HD fare, and attempts to uncover what makes Dickens so damn watchable. Gwilym Mumford The Story of Musicals 9pm, BBC4 Second part of a cultural history as compelling as it has been timely (a fair whack of the \u00a31.5bn generated annually by West End musicals must be down to people who can't think of anything else to do with relatives in town for Christmas). This episode considers the gestation and influence of such blockbusters as Blood Brothers, Phantom of the Opera and Cats, Andrew Lloyd Webber's monstrously profitable adaptation of TS Eliot's feline poetry which was, at the time, predicted to be commercial suicide. Cameron Mackintosh, Tim Rice, Robert Stigwood, Trevor Nunn and the apparently compulsory Stephen Fry offer their insights. Andrew Mueller The Great Sport Relief Bake Off 8pm, BBC2 What's the connection between cakes and sport? None really, unless you're using the latter to burn off calories amassed by excessive consumption of the former, but a hit show is a hit show and thus Auntie's baking challenge gets a celeb series on behalf of Sport Relief. In the first of three heats, actors Angela Griffin and Sarah Hadland, gardener Joe Swift and botanist James Wong compete for a place in the final. Entertaining, especially the inevitable moment when judge Paul Hollywood gets all serious: \"You've got to nail the bake!\" Jonathan Wright Websex: What's The Harm? 9pm, BBC3 As part of BBC3's sex season, former Hollyoaks star Nathalie Emmanuel investigates how the internet is changing the love lives of 16- to 24-year-olds across Britain, for whom it has become a vast and effective dating agency. She meets young adults who rely on social networking sites, examines the latest available mobile technology and webcams, and discusses the latest studies on online activity among our young and lusty youth.
