Not a severed ear or a still-beating heart, but the kind with a keyboard. \u201cThey never said anything,\u201d says Berry. \u201cThere was no explanation, no lessons, just me and the organ.\u201d In short order, he had mastered the keyboard, then the guitar, and soon his big goal as a teenager was to emulate multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield. \u201cI read that he was 17 when he made Tubular Bells. I thought, \u2018I\u2019m 14 \u2013 better get a move on.\u2019 That\u2019s what led me to buy a secondhand bass guitar and a four-track recorder.\u201d This isn\u2019t what I expected at all, the revelations of a self-taught polymath. I\u2019d hoped to conduct this interview from two open-top sightseeing buses. Berry would be on one and I\u2019d shout questions through a megaphone from the other. This would have been a reprise of the bus-off between his most famous creation, the eponymous thespian lothario from TV comedy Toast of London, and that character\u2019s turtle-necked nemesis, Ray Purchase. \u201cEveryone in London knows your wife\u2019s a prostitute,\u201d shouted Toast . \u201cYou take that back, Toast,\u201d retorted Purchase. Instead, we\u2019re reclining on a leather sofa in a Soho club. Berry is sipping Diet Coke. Again, this is intolerable. The 45-year-old should be importuning waitresses, channelling the role of Douglas Renholm, the lecherous boss he played in The IT Crowd, running about shouting: \u201cGod damn these electric sex pants!\u201d Or he could even be drinking the bar dry, like his latest TV incarnation: mutton-chopped, one-eyebrowed, foul-mouthed Victorian detective, Rabbit. But, no, Berry\u2019s detailing his teenage recording techniques in a hushed voice. He is amiable but, and there\u2019s no easy way to say this, shy and sartorially uninteresting. Yet I\u2019m grateful for the organ story since it gives a rare insight into Berry\u2019s past. He scarcely mentions his upbringing or private life in interviews. \u201cI\u2019m a clown,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what everybody wants me to be. Nobody wants to hear about my \u2018psychic wound\u2019. Nobody wants me to be their life coach.\u201d What nonsense. Matt Berry Was My Life Coach \u2013 what a movie that would be. But he has a point. If we knew the dreary truth about Berry, that would ruin the fantasy. We want to imagine him as Toast, flatsharing with a similarly bitter thesp. As for psychic wounds, well, we inch closer to one when Berry tells me about his first day at Nottingham Trent University. It was there he studied contemporary art and dreamed of becoming a painter. \u201cA lecturer stood up and said, \u2018Here are six paintings. Which is the odd one out?\u2019 Then he pointed to one and said, \u2018It\u2019s this one. Because it\u2019s the last painting I ever did.\u2019 I admired him for saying that. It was an epiphany for me. I realised I didn\u2019t want to make the mistake of getting a proper job. I wanted to do art for ever.\u201d It didn\u2019t quite work out that way. After graduating, he made for London and slipped into miserable positions in telesales before landing a job at the London Dungeon. He was paid \u00a3178 a week to play a judge in the morning and Jack the Ripper in the afternoon. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t Rada, but you learned how to get the story right and not to fluff your lines.\u201d Then, in around 1999, he met Noel Fielding. Like Berry, the Bake-Off host and funnyman has art chops and no formal training in acting. They clicked and Fielding invited Berry to perform some songs at Islington\u2019s Hen and Chickens pub. \u201cI was doing serial-killer confessionals in song: \u2018This is where they bodies are buried!\u2019 I thought they were funny.\u201d On the same bill were Richard Ayoade and Matthew Holness, who persuaded Berry to star in their parody of 80s horror TV, Garth Marenghi\u2019s Darkplace. Full of dodgy acting, choppy editing and flawed storylines, all of them deliberate, the show aired on Channel 4 in 2004, giving us the first taste of the rich, fruity voice that has become Berry\u2019s trademark. Since then, he hasn\u2019t stopped. He paints, acts and has released six studio albums, even writing \u2013 with Ayoade \u2013 a satirical rock opera called AD/BC. Music, he says, is the most important outlet for his creativity. \u201cI dream about music, never comedy.\u201d How? \u201cWell, I dream of guitars \u2013 different kinds of guitar.\u201d Earlier this year, Berry starred as Michael Squeamish, a know-nothing TV hack, in a mockumentary called The Road to Brexit, co-written with longtime collaborator Arthur Mathews. \u201cI thought it was funny, a breathing space from the madness.\u201d Did researching it change the way you vote? He laughs, by way of an answer. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say.\u201d Why? \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to be anybody\u2019s life coach.\u201d Again with the life coach. And now there\u2019s Year of the Rabbit, a Channel 4 show starting next week in which Berry plays a liver-ruining detective battling Victorian London\u2019s parade of nonces, ponces, top-hatted tossers, pre-pubescent narks and post-menopausal booze slingers. Rabbit (his sister is called Weasel, his brother Leopard) is a swearing virtuoso. Legend has it, I tell Berry, that sellers at London\u2019s Billingsgate market could swear 20 minutes straight without repetition. We have lost that art: now swearing is reduced to Gordon Ramsay effing and jeffing on autopilot on Kitchen Nightmares. \u201cThat verbal creativity is what I like about Rabbit\u201d says Berry. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of my dad in the role. He has that dry deprecatory wit. If I was going to do something stupid, he\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, going to do that, are you?\u2019 I wanted to capture that British deflationary way of speaking.\u201d Rabbit is assisted by rookie Wilbur Strauss, a Cambridge criminology graduate played by Freddie Fox, and his adoptive daughter Mabel Wisbech, portrayed by the droll Susan Wokoma, who is striving to break Victorian policing\u2019s glass ceiling. Together this threesome fight a losing battle against crime. \u201cIt\u2019s the Victorian Sweeney,\u201d says Berry. How would he know? Berry for many years didn\u2019t have a TV. \u201cWell, I was too young to watch The Sweeney when it was first on, but I caught up with it fairly recently. I\u2019ve become quite obsessed.\u201d Berry wants Year of the Rabbit to echo Only Fools and Horses, John Sullivan\u2019s classic London sitcom, in one respect. \u201cIt has a working-class warmth that you don\u2019t often see convincingly elsewhere. I got it from my dad and my grandmother \u2013 that warmth and fondness coming through in sarcasm. \u201cIn Year of the Rabbit, I wanted to get the rookie-cop-and-old-hand cliche done and dusted fast. We\u2019ve seen that a million times. What I wanted to get to was the sense of the three of them looking out for each other \u2013 even as they rip the crap out of each other.\u201d One lovely moment has Rabbit explaining his beat. \u201cThis city is a rat eating its own babies, babies made of shit, and once it eats its own shit babies, it shits them out again, and then it noshes them, and that goes on and on until the sun turns cold and the sea goes back into the sky.\u201d Which is of course exactly the sort of briefing Met boss Cressida Dick wishes she could make. Year of the Rabbit could be the unexpected comedy delight of 2019. Equally welcome news is the fact that Berry is planning a fourth series of Toast of London. He\u2019s just not sure when he\u2019ll have time to write it. For three and a half months a year, he\u2019s now contracted to live and work in the US, filming What We Do In the Shadows, the comedy horror series about four vampires rooming together in New York. Why play Toast again? \u201cBecause he\u2019s the anti-me. I wrote him because I met so many actors who are utterly vicious about other actors \u2013 always frustrated, bitter and cynical. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m doing all the things I ever wanted. More than I ever imagined. I never dreamed of being a comedian. I never imagined I\u2019d be a clown. There aren\u2019t enough hours in the day. But otherwise I\u2019m living the life I wanted.\u201d What about doing voices for ads? Surely they\u2019ve made you rich but not creatively fulfilled? He laughs. \u201cI\u2019m amazed I still get the work.\u201d Why? \u201cI thought I\u2019d satirised the job into oblivion as Toast. But that only made them want me more. Weird.\u201d \u2022 Year of the Rabbit begins on Channel 4 on 10 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
