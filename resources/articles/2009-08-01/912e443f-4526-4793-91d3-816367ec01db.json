So when people argue that the Glazers have been decent owners of Manchester United, they are not suggesting they have been perfect but simply that they could have been a lot worse. They could, for instance, have been Tom Hicks and George Gillett. Or Rupert Murdoch or Michael Knighton, both of whom almost did own United. Instead, the club ended up in the hands of the highly secretive and, more to the point, highly leveraged Americans back in the summer of 2005. Since then, results have been good, which has gone some way to quieten the criticism that accompanied the arrival of the men from Tampa and the creative \u2013 for the want of a better word \u2013 way they financed buying an English institution. It has helped that they have seldom been seen in Manchester and, as much as anyone can tell, they have let David Gill do what he is paid to do and Sir Alex Ferguson do what he is a genius at doing. Sure, ticket prices are high and the marketing department wields way too much power \u2013 another Asian tour anyone? \u2013 but that is standard procedure at clubs of United's stature and it is hard to believe it would have been markedly different under different owners. Yet opinions might change if, as many now seem to think, the United squad for the coming season is now set. No one in their right mind reads the swath of transfer rumours that circulate at this time of the year without assuming that the vast majority are fantasy. Maybe 1% of them are true, maybe even less. Yet football people are like people in every other walk of life, in that they just can't keep their mouth shut, especially if they actually do know something. Inevitably, they let something slip to someone who lets it slip to someone else and so on until the initial truth, modified and distilled, eventually ends up in the papers and on the websites. The point being that there is usually a kernel of truth in the rumours, or at least a whiff of what is actually going on. That being so, it would seem that nothing is going on at Manchester United, not unless you count the ever more frequent suggestions that Nemanja Vidic will be heading out the door, as have Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo. Even if this is not the case, it wouldn't alter the fact that there has been a very curious transfer window at Old Trafford, one in which United have been net sellers, with most of the \u00a380m received for Ronaldo currently sitting in the bank. This could be coincidence, or it might simply be a case of bad luck. Maybe the attempt to sign Karim Benzema really was aborted because he didn't represent good value at \u00a335m. Likewise Tevez, another player deemed not to have been good value at the asking price. Whether this is true of either player (especially in today's febrile market) is debatable. What is indisputable is that value for money has never been the primary guiding force at United. If Ferguson wanted a player he usually got him, regardless of the price, as was the case with Dimitar Berbatov. Something has clearly changed, then, and we can assume it isn't Ferguson's desire to win or his judgment of football flesh. As he conceded, it is impossible to replace Ronaldo, the best player in the world. But to not even try is completely out of character, not least because it leaves United in a weaker position than they were last season. Surely, Ferguson would find that intolerable, unless he has been put in a position where he has been forced to tolerate it. There are few people able to bend the Scotsman's will, but by virtue of their status as United's owners the Glazers are among them, especially if the family has finally decided to make its influence felt in football matters for reasons that have nothing to do with football and everything to do with finance. If so, if the Manchester United of 2009 really has been turned into a selling club, they might find that shallow pool of goodwill that has carried them thus far will disappear just as quickly as you can say \"Isn't that what Hicks and Gillett have done to Liverpool?\" Celtic's defeat highlights Scotland's decline Reading this paper's match report on Tuesday night's all-British Champions League qualifier between Celtic and Arsenal, the eye was caught by Kevin McCarra's suggestion that it was inconceivable the Scottish team would be able to overcome a two-goal deficit when the sides meet again in London. Kevin was absolutely right, although if the thesaurus had contained a more damning word than \"inconceivable\" he would have been entitled to use it. It is usually dangerous to draw conclusions on the basis of 90 minutes but, such was the difference in class between the two sides, I would argue the reasons for the chasm are more systemic than particular. Only a couple of seasons ago a Celtic team managed by Gordon Strachan defeated Manchester United at home 1-0, and lost by the odd goal in five at Old Trafford. Despite the relatively short space of time that has lapsed, those results now seem like the remnants of a bygone era. Suffice to say, they wouldn't happen now; they probably never will again, such has been the decline in the standard of the game north of the border. Next season, Scotland won't have an automatic qualifier into the group stage of the Champions League, which means Celtic and Rangers will be forced to go through the rigours of qualification. Barring a miracle, or an extremely lucky draw, it is hard to believe either will progress \u2013 not next year, not in the foreseeable future. Deporting Ponting would give us hope at The Oval It is never too late to take drastic action, especially when the Ashes are at stake, which freshly minted aphorism brings us to the news this week that six Australian members of the Celtic Crusaders Super League squad are to be deported for what is being described as \"serious visa offences\". As upstanding British citizens we are all meant to be appalled by such behaviour, but it does rather raise the question: why couldn't the immigration authorities have tried the same thing with the Australian cricket squad? Never mind six deportees, the sight of the great Ricky Ponting being escorted on to the first flight back to Sydney would have been enough to give us hope at The Oval. Bloodgate does not mean rugby is rotten to the core Rugby union's so-called Bloodgate scandal raises some serious issues about the state of the modern game and the conduct of those who take part in it, on and off the pitch. Yet let us not get too carried away by it all. The sport is not, as some excitable souls have suggested, rotten to its core. A few collars needed feeling and they were duly felt. Hopefully, others will have taken note and will adjust their behaviour accordingly. In the meantime, those seeking crumbs of consolation from the last few days should understand that any scandal, however unwelcome, is always good for business. After all, the profile of English rugby was never higher than in the 1990s when, thanks to individuals such as Will Carling and Lawrence Dallaglio, the game was seldom more than a few weeks away from another tabloid revelation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
