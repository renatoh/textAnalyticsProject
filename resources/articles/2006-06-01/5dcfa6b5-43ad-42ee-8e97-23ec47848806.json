On the eve of his elevation to the House of Lords, Bill Morris, who for 12 years was leader of the TGWU, admits that looming \"mega-mergers\" between big unions could soon create an unacceptable concentration of power at a time when their falling membership diminishes their authority. \"If you're not speaking for your members, you cannot be speaking for the party. There needs to be radical reform and the trade unions need to recognise that it's a new situation, a new agenda. And a new relationship has to emerge,\" Lord Morris tells GMTV's Sunday programme. He urges a party-union review to reshape the way they work together. With Sir Hayden Phillips, the retired Whitehall mandarin, examining wider options to restore public trust in the way parties are funded, Lord Morris insists that union ties with Labour are constitutionally regulated and cannot be compared with corporate donations to either Labour or the Tories. Labour wants to curb company cash, not its own union sources. But he admits that the unions have become obstructive as they have swung to the left in recent years, less to promote their own agenda than \"to defeat the government, defeat the platform\" at party conferences. With a former cabinet minister, Chris Smith, also a Labour peer, urging Tony Blair to step down next year, Lord Morris warned against a rush to succeed John Prescott as deputy leader if he were to stand down at the same time. \"My worry is that we have a whole plethora of people lining up and having this great debate and we have no vacancy, no vacancy at all.\" In a poll for BBC1's Politics Show, 64% of voters blame ministers for what they regard as growing incompetence in government, and only 25% blame officials. Asked whether Labour's policies are good but ministers are unable to deliver them, 69% agree, with the figure rising to 72% among young people."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
