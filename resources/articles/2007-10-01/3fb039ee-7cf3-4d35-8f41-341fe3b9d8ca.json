Despite being renowned for their attacking play, which was only expected to improve after the arrivals of Carlos Tevez, Nani and Anderson in the summer, United have not scored more than one goal in 11 of their 12 matches this season and will expect to change that against opposition who have conceded 11 goals in their three previous visits to Old Trafford. \"It's crazy, we get criticised for winning 1-0,\" he said yesterday. \"If we won 5-1 you'd say our defence was going to pieces. I think what is happening is unusual for us, that has to be said, and I think that every team that comes up against us now will be waiting for a deluge. We know it's going to happen. \"It will happen, we will score goals. Unfortunately it's not come as quick as I would like. We're playing well, we're creating chances, it will happen.\" Ferguson is hopeful that Owen Hargreaves, who had an injection to alleviate a knee problem this week, will return to training within 10 days but he will be without Michael Carrick for six weeks because of a fractured elbow. Ryan Giggs or Anderson is likely to line up alongside Paul Scholes this lunchtime, with Ferguson doing little to disguise his contempt for the early kick-off. \"I saw the list of who was refereeing the games and I couldn't believe how few games there are on Saturday,\" he said. \"There are only two games on the Saturday, one 3pm kick-off and all the rest are Sunday. I just don't know how that's come about. Saturday at 5pm is a crazy time as far as I'm concerned, it's a horrible time. But it just shows how the game has changed. No Saturday games, all Sunday games. I think there must be some weddings on.\" The Wigan manager, Chris Hutchings, who has seen his side go five Premier League games without a win, has thanked the chairman, Dave Whelan, for giving him the same support his predeccesor, Paul Jewell, received. \"The chairman has been fantastic,\" he said. \"He lets me get on with the job and that is the most important thing. He let me buy the players I wanted and so far we've been lucky enough to get the players I have wanted. So his backing has been 100%.\" The last time Hutchings led out a team at Old Trafford was in 2000 during his short tenure in charge of Bradford when he saw his side suffer a gruesome 6-0 defeat. \"I've not had too much to do with Ferguson so far, only a few phone calls, but I'm looking forward to seeing him,\" he said. \"Hopefully he might have a bottle of red wine for me after the game - and I don't care what it is, as long as we get a result.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
