Through some of the web traffic strategies that I'm about to talk about, I'm confident that I have enough readers to finally show you Butterflyist, my new site. If you read my story, you'll see my niche is a very personal one, and the idea of expanding comfort zones and inspiring others to do the same is something I genuinely care about. In terms of driving traffic to my site, Glen Allsopp, my ever-patient teacher from Viperchill, tells me it's important to have a good angle so people will view you as an expert on that topic. Which hopefully means you'll get approached to share your opinion. And when it comes to boundary-pushing, it's a speciality of mine, whether through travel, or taking a chance on life. Like leaving my salaried and pensioned public-sector job to enter the uncertain world of freelancing. Depending on your niche, you can try different methods to drive traffic your way. We've already talked about the most important: creating popular content that gets shared. But be imaginative about ways to get others involved in your site. I had a fun competition, \"Become a Butterflyist\", where I asked readers which one of my favourite sites they felt should feature at the top of my blog for 2012. Some of the sites themselves also gathered votes via their own social networks. Speaking of which, Glen says \"Be where your audience is at, and on the social networks where you'll find them.\" Don't just publish into the ether; mingle online, whether this be through Google+, Facebook, LinkedIn, or wherever else your crowd hang out. I'm especially fond of Twitter, where I'm now @thebutterflyist \u2013 choosing my handle, of course, to be similar to my blog name, as part of my \"branding\" strategy. I find it a good place to strike up conversations that lead to collaborations, as well as tweet my posts. You could also try requesting an interview with a blogger doing something notable in your niche. Once you've written and published it on your site, the site-owner is likely to alert their own audience to it, so bringing more eyes to your blog. What we're talking about is how to build search engine rankings. That is, the more you get featured on the web by other people who like what you're doing, and they write about and link to you, the more \"backlinks\" you build. This means search engines such as Google and Yahoo view you as A Good Thing. They are then more likely to point people your way who are typing search terms relevant to your niche. On a final note, I've found out the hard way that it's crucial to be consistent in providing value. With a previous starter blog I wrote, I lost readers fast when I started blogging about things that were unconnected to my focus. So, don't get lazy and start blogging about what your cat did in its litter tray this morning, when you normally write lengthy posts about how to be an effective homeworker. As always, this topic is explored in much more depth at the BloggingCaseStudy.com site Glen has created. Next time, we're going to start looking at monetisation strategies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
