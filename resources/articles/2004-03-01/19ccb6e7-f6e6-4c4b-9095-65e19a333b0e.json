The Glamorgan fast bowler made his comeback today after 16 months on the sidelines since sustaining a cruciate knee ligament injury against Australia in Brisbane. Jones, eager to impress with the chance of a Test return at Sabina Park next Thursday, had an immediate impact by taking a catch in the sixth over of the day to remove Kenyan opener Kennedy Otieno and earn Steve Harmison his first wicket of the Caribbean tour. He was forced to wait until shortly before lunch to finally bowl again for the seniors and despite his recent matches for England A in India, Jones showed signs of rustiness by conceding six in his first over and nine off his next, including successive fours from opener Jason Haynes. Jones also appeared to upset the umpire for a sustained lbw appeal in that second over, standing with hands on hips looking back down the pitch which caused the officials to speak to captain Michael Vaughan at the end of the over. While Jones struggled to make an impact during his four overs with the ball, he had at least helped Harmison, who finished wicketless in the opening match against Jamaica, to end his barren run with a sharply-lifting delivery which opener Otieno could only fend to the Welshman at extra cover. Matthew Hoggard, preferred in this match to Lancashire seamer James Anderson, overcame an inconsistent start into the wind by returning to claim England's only other wicket of the opening session when he trapped Dwayne Bravo leg before 12 overs later. But after that Haynes treated England to some typical West Indian flair and drove with great flamboyance, including a straight six over long on off Hoggard during his opening spell. Haynes, who captains both this side and West Indies B, teamed up with Steve Tikolo, the other member of the Kenyan squad which reached the World Cup semi-finals in South Africa last year, in an unbroken 36-run partnership which guided the Vice-chancellor's XI to 72 for two at lunch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
