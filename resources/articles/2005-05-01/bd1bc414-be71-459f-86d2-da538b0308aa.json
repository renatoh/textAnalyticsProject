With the controversy surrounding Malcolm Glazer's takeover of United expected to reignite today with protests at the game in Cardiff, leading voices, including Graham Kelly, the former chief executive of the Football Association, Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, MPs and numerous supporters' groups have called for reform in the interests of the game's grassroots. In a letter to the Guardian, the group lambasts the football authorities and the government for failing to scrutinise or prevent the Glazer takeover, and warns that a failure to act will lead to the collapse of clubs. \"To allow one of the nation's leading sporting clubs to be buffeted on the whims of the market demonstrates a failure of leadership and governance by the football authorities, Westminster and Whitehall,\" the letter states. \"It is ironic that the only sporting regulatory body to investigate this takeover will be the National Football League in the USA.\" The letter's signatories, who include singer and activist Billy Bragg, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, Labour MP Alan Keen, who is chairman of the all-party football group, and Phil French of Supporters Direct, maintain that market listing is unsuitable for football clubs. They want a club's success to be measured in a more traditional way - results on the field, producing young players, facilities for spectators and links between clubs and local communities. They say: \"The legal status of many football clubs as publicly-traded companies whose shares are available for purchase by all-comers with no safeguards has come to be seen by many as inappropriate for a sports club. \"The status of football clubs as publicly traded companies has led to people buying into them who have no interest whatsoever in the game. \"The heads of both the European and world football bodies have recently stated that the publicly traded company structure is not appropriate for football clubs, yet on this issue, there is silence from both government and game's authorities.\" The call for reform comes as Lord Burns, who conducted inquiries into BBC charter reform and foxhunting, carries out a review of the FA's structure. The signatories believe that the review presents an opportunity for change, but if Lord Burns is not effective, the government must act to protect the game. \"If football is incapable of reforming itself then the government and parliament must act. The millions of us who love and follow the game deserve no less.\" A government regulator for football has been rejected in the past and is unlikely to gain traction within Whitehall. Richard Caborn, the sports minister, pressed the FA to engage Lord Burns, and there is little appetite among ministers, club chairmen or football administrators for government taking a direct hand in sport."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
