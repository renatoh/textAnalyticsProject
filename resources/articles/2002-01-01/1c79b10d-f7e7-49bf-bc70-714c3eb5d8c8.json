Davis and the goalkeeper Dickie Dyke are the only two survivors from that Yeovil team, who often plied themselves with their secret \"egg, sherry and something else\" punch before matches. \"It was the greatest day of my life. But twice I thought the match would be abandoned and it would all count for nothing. \"First, with just five minutes remaining, the whole ground was covered by this incredible fog. No one could see a thing. I felt sure the referee would call it off. But then the fog disappeared as quickly as it had come. To this day I'm convinced the crowd were so excited by the prospect of a famous victory that they blew it away. \"Then, with two minutes to go, the ref blew up for a foul and the crowd, thinking it was all over, invaded the pitch. But we pleaded with them to go back and they did. \"Eric Bryant and Alec Stock scored the goals. Alec was a great manager, a father of 11 boys if you like. In the fifth round we got beaten 8-0 by Manchester United at Maine Road - Old Trafford was still not ready after the war.\" Milton Graham Bournemouth 2 - 0 Manchester United Third round, 1984 This was Manchester United's second defeat by a Third Division club in three weeks, having lost to Oxford in the Milk Cup. Six First Division sides went out in the third round but this was the biggest shock. Bournemouth reached the fourth round for the first time in 24 years. Tottenham-born midfield player Graham, now 39 and working as a boat-builder, scored the first goal and Ian Thompson the second. Graham was released by Bournemouth the following year and joined Chester, then Peterborough. But he suffered a serious ankle injury in 1989 and retired from professional football in 1991. \"I still feel proud of winning promotion in my first season with Chester. But that goal against Manchester United at Dean Court has to top everything. They were the Cup holders. But when we drew Middlesbrough in the next round I was left out of the team, which was a bit of a choker. \"It was at Bournemouth that I had this superstition of putting my shorts on last. I don't know why. \"After pro football I had a spell with Stamford. My ankle was OK to play at that standard. We won the United Counties League two years running - I still get carried away with football and have to remind myself that it is no longer the be-all and end-all.\" Tony Rains Sutton United 2 - 1 Coventry City Third round, 1989 Tony Rains played a leading role in one of the greatest upsets in FA Cup history, as Sutton, of the Conference, beat Coventry, then doing well in the old First Division and the winners of the competition under John Sillett two years previously. Rains, 40, is now back with the club as assistant manager while he drives a cab for a living. His brother, John, is manager. \"We had given a clue to what we could do the year before, when we took Middlesbrough to a replay,\" he says. \"But when the Coventry game came along all we wanted to do was avoid total humiliation. \"The great thing is that we didn't go out to kick them off the park. We didn't even concede a free-kick in the second half. I put us ahead when I scored from a Micky Stephens corner just before half-time. Then Matt Hanlan scored our winner after they had equalised. \"Within 30 seconds of the final whistle the entire pitch was covered with supporters. We didn't want to leave the scene and go back to our changing room. After a while we even went up into the stands to watch the celebrations and soak it all in. \"We all knew we would never have this experience again and we got beaten 8-0 by Norwich in the next round. That result against Coventry was the highlight of my career by a very long way. Everybody still wants to talk to me about it, especially at this time of year, and then all those great feelings come flooding back.\" Ronnie Radford Hereford United 2 - 1 Newcastle United Third-round replay, 1972 Ronnie Radford, 58, below left, who now works as a joiner in Leeds, still meets up with his fellow goalscorer Ricky George to talk about the time their goals gave the non-league side a famous, muddy victory over Malcolm Macdonald's Newcastle. Hereford had reached the first round proper of the competition on 23 occasions in the previous 24 seasons but this was their finest hour. \"This was the most wonderful day,\" he says. \"And when I see the videos, with the expressions of delight on those kids' faces as they run on the pitch on the final whistle, it still makes me feel emotional. \"We all thought we had done well to get a draw at St James' and fetch them back to our place. Nobody gave us a prayer. Joe Harvey was their manager and was to take them to Wembley two years later. \"Once Macdonald scored we thought it was all over. But we never gave up. I got the first goal and then Ricky stunned Newcastle with the late winner. \"We went up to the Second Division, then slid down again, which is sad. I still follow the club's fortunes. And there are always people ringing up to remind me of that win over Newcastle, so I couldn't forget it even if I wanted to.\" Ray Crawford Colchester United 3 - 2 Leeds United Fifth round, 1971 Ray Crawford scored twice as Fourth Division Colchester went 3-0 up against a bewildered Leeds at Layer Road. Crawford, now 65, was hardly unknown. His powerful forward play had led Ipswich to the League championship in 1961-62. He also won two England caps in 1962. But he thought he had left all the glory days behind him when he drifted into non-league football, from which he was rescued by Colchester's manager Dick Graham. After his brief adventure with Colchester he went to South Africa and now does part-time promotional work in his native Portsmouth. \"This was the match of a lifetime and a day I will never forget,\" he says. \"Leeds were one of the best sides in Europe and they had all their big guns playing, apart from Billy Bremner. We were a real Dad's Army of a side. I was 34 and three or four others were the same age or older. \"But the funny thing was that I had always scored goals against Jack Charlton. I really fancied myself to score here and managed a couple. \"The other thing was that their goalkeeper, Gary Sprake, was going through a bad time. So we decided to bombard him with crosses. \"Our winger, Brian Lewis, sent over a free-kick for me to head us in front and I squeezed the next over the line while lying on the ground after another effort had rebounded off Paul Reaney's back. \"But Dick, our manager, was really clever. He knew Leeds liked to play the ball around on wide open spaces and he made our tight pitch feel even smaller by placing chairs and benches around the edges.\" Roy Essandoh Leicester City 1 - 2 Wycombe Wanderers Sixth round, 2001 Roy Essandoh came on as a substitute and won this quarter-final with a stoppage-time header. He joined Wycombe after reading a teletext story in which they pleaded for new strikers and was given a contract until the end of the season. It was not renewed and after going to Barnet he is now with Cambridge City. \"I suppose I will always be remembered for that goal,\" he says. \"A free-kick came into the box and I just threw myself at the ball. Things were pretty hectic for the next few weeks. \"But I'm still positive. I'm young enough to make those things happen again. And that great feeling is still fresh in my mind. I've thought of moving back to Finland but I really want to stay in England.\" Steve Watkin Wrexham 2 - 1 Arsenal Third round, 1992 Arsenal have won the FA Cup seven times and been runners-up on another seven occasions. But they will never forget the time they were humbled by Wrexham's 20-year-old Steve Watkin a decade ago. Watkin was in his first season as a Wrexham regular. But his career never lived up to his goal against the league champions. He moved to Swansea, where he still plays, in 1997-98. \"I've found it hard to top that goal,\" he says. \"It wasn't a particularly good one. The cross came over from the right, I got a foot to it and it trickled in. \"It was almost exactly 10 years ago, so I will get the video out soon and have another look. I've not seen it for ages. \"But I do remember that the last 10 minutes, after my goal, were the longest of my life. I was a local lad and had only just broken into the first team. So it was a special, special moment when the final whistle went. \"It must have given us some confidence because we won promotion to the Second Division the following season and beat West Ham in the Cup a few years later. \"There is a lot of Cup tradition at t he Racecourse. They've got to the sixth round three times and regularly qualified for the European Cup Winners' Cup. But that win over Arsenal tops everything for me.\" Four who hope to emulate them Sergio Ommel Bristol Rovers (away to Derby) The 24-year-old Dutch striker with the Spanish name, signed on a free from Iceland's KR, has been one of Rovers' few bright spots in a mostly grim season. \"He has a hunger to score goals,\" said Rovers' new manager Garry Thompson on Ommel's arrival, and in seven appearances so far he has notched three, all in different competitions, including one in the second-round win over Plymouth. Lee Boylan Canvey Island (away to Burnley) The former West Ham trainee arrived at Canvey in August, via Trelleborg, Exeter and a variety of non-league stops. He is the Islanders' top scorer with 18 in their amazing season - they have won 26 of their past 27 games in all competitions - and has scored five in the past three games. The man most likely if Canvey are to create another shock, and the perfect name for midwinter heroics - if it's freezing, he'll be Boylan. Junior McDougald Dagenham &amp; Redbridge (home to Ipswich) McDougald's 78 league games for Brighton do not quite stack up to the pedigree of his fellow strikers at Dagenham, Ken Charlery and Mark Stein, but he did score three times in the Cup for Albion in 1995 - all against this year's other non-league survivors Canvey. Grabbed one in the last round against Exeter and two in the Conference on Boxing Day. Danny Invincible Swindon (away to Manchester City) Town's new manager Andy King was on the losing side for Everton against Kevin Keegan in the 1977 semi-final but Keegan's City have what it takes to be the fall guys today. Who better to administer the knockout blow than the Australian with the headline-friendly name who has scored in both rounds so far? Well, possibly Town's striker Eric Sabin, who played in a French Cup final for the Second Division club N\u00eemes. It is worth putting a few euros on either. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
