Once Bruno\u2019s lifeless body hit the ground, there was no way the standoff could end peacefully, but let\u2019s credit the true architect of this calamity. Like some new-age guru, Brett O\u2019Keefe manifested his reality. All government relies on tyranny mixed with a mantra \u2013 repeat until true. Years of what Saul calls his \u201ctoxic bullshit\u201d comes to fruition with the conflagration of the compound. All liberation movements have a defining moment: the Stonewall riots, the Birmingham church bombing, the Tiananmen Square massacre \u2013 and now we have Lucasville. In what passes for his mind, O\u2019Keefe is in no doubt he is spearheading the ultimate liberation movement. The final nudge over the edge comes from a carefully placed fake news report about JJ\u2019s death, but the victory is all O\u2019Keefe\u2019s. The look on his face as he exits the compound and sees Saul is vindication. This is what Homeland can do when it\u2019s on its game. The expertly built tension culminates in a gut punch of a payoff \u2013 and everything changes for the worse. \u2018I mean, it\u2019s crazytown. Anything is possible\u2019 It was only a matter of time before Maggie worked out that Carrie was off her medication. Her sister forces her to take her Seroquel, necessitating a trip to her Dr Feelgood, AKA Josh, to load up on a hastily prepared cocktail of knockoff Ritalin and magnesium. That this is a terrible idea is obvious to everyone, but that high-level conspiracy won\u2019t unravel itself. Dante is charged with keeping an eye on Carrie as she rides the Ritalin wave and their double act is quietly coming along. He has at least had a bipolar girlfriend before, but Carrie and her lifestyle present a unique set of challenges. Travelling back to Hazelton, she traces Simone Martin\u2019s movements and discovers she withdrew close to $50,000 from a series of cash advance stores in the days before McClendon\u2019s murder. It sounds about the right amount for a prestige contract killing, and Simone looks guiltier by the hour. \u2018All I care about is you having a chance to show them you can be a great president\u2019 Homeland often manages to be frighteningly real and laughably implausible, sometimes in the same scene. That David still has all his teeth and his job after unilaterally ordering a military strike in Syria against the express wishes of the president strains credibility to breaking point. It may be that, like Mr Burns, she wants to react but is simply paralysed with rage and the real reckoning is yet to come. David\u2019s weak rambling about needing to \u201cput one up in the win column\u201d doesn\u2019t help. Strangely enough, the same public who voted Elizabeth in for her military draw-down promises warmly welcome the strike on the morning talkshows which David at least takes comfort from. He tells her he is willing to go to prison for his treachery which, as we know, is always an option with Elizabeth. It\u2019s quite funny that she worries about the intelligence services bugging her phone when, unbeknownst to her or David, Carrie listens in on their conversation on her surveillance. Maybe Elizabeth should keep a cell warm for Carrie, too. Notes and observations JJ and Bruno play out the Ruby Ridge scenario where 14-year-old Sammy Weaver was killed after his dog, Striker, was shot by US marshals. If the bearded man behind the \u201cFBI lets boy bleed to death\u201d story looks familiar, that\u2019s because it\u2019s Oleg from The Americans (Costa Ronin). It\u2019s a popular question these days, but is it the Russians again? He looks a little too slick to be an amateur. O\u2019Keefe has time to tell Bo Elkins that the report about JJ is false but chooses not to. That hesitation is crucial. Seconds later, Bo kills the FBI agent and the compound is stormed. He could have ended it at any point, as he promised Mary he would, but then he wouldn\u2019t have had his legend: Brett O\u2019Keefe, survivor of the Lucasville massacre. I was terribly impressed with Carrie channelling Maggie as the concerned sibling of a woman with bipolar disorder when talking to the payday loans guy. All those years of being a worry to her family finally pay off. How will the public react to Lucasville? Is David going to jail? And what are your theories on the bearded man?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
