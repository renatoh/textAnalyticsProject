Stephan Ernst, a 45-year-old German man with a string of convictions for violent anti-migrant crime, was arrested two weeks after the murder of Walter L\u00fcbcke, 65. Police had matched Ernst\u2019s DNA with evidence recovered from the scene of the crime. The German interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said on Wednesday that Ernst had confessed to what Seehofer called a \u201cpolitical murder\u201d and that the hunt was still on for possible accomplices. Ernst reportedly said L\u00fcbcke\u2019s pro-refugee stance was his motive. L\u00fcbcke, a member of Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats (CDU), was well known as a champion of refugees in Germany. He had previously received death threats due to his stance. Ernst admitted being incensed by L\u00fcbcke\u2019s comments at a town hall meeting in October 2015, Spiegel Online reported. At the meeting, held to discuss a new asylum seeker shelter, as hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees entered the country, L\u00fcbcke reportedly said: \u201cOne has to stand up for values here. And those who don\u2019t do so can leave this country any time, if they don\u2019t like it. That\u2019s the freedom of every German.\u201d It is not clear whether Ernst attended the meeting, but a video of L\u00fcbcke\u2019s comments was reportedly circulated in far-right forums and was mentioned at rallies by the anti-immigration Pegida movement at the height of the migration crisis. Investigators believe Ernst had contact with the far-right NPD party, as well as the neo-Nazi group Combat 18, whose members are known for promoting violence, hoarding weapons and spreading far-right propaganda and bomb-making guides. He served a prison sentence after attempting to plant a pipe bomb outside a home for asylum seekers in 1993. He was arrested 10 years ago at a neo-Nazi march in Dortmund and sentenced to seven months\u2019 probation for breaching the peace. Extremists and neo-Nazis have posted messages online appearing to applaud L\u00fcbcke\u2019s murder, stoking fears that a wider networkcould have been involved in the killing. The killing has deeply shaken Germany and raised questions about whether the country has failed to take seriously a rising threat from neo-Nazis. Ernst has claimed he acted alone, but Seehofer said investigators would continue to hunt for possible accomplices or co-conspirators. \u201cThe investigation of this political murder is not yet complete,\u201d Seehofer said. He promised to \u201cdo everything humanly possible to investigate this terrible act\u201d, adding: \u201cWe will continue to work hard to establish whether there were accessories or even accomplices. We owe that to the public.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
