The Australian published the results of its fortnightly Newspoll survey on Monday, just as the government prepared to reintroduce the repeal bills into the House of Representatives following the defeat of the legislation in the Senate last week. The three PUP senators joined Labor and the Greens to scuttle the repeal on Thursday after a dispute over amendments to guarantee power price reductions led to frantic negotiations between the government and crossbenchers in the corridor outside the Senate. In the telephone poll taken from Friday to Sunday, 1,207 voters were told that the PUP had \u201cblocked the removal of the carbon tax in the Senate\u201d and were asked whether they personally thought the party should \u201ccontinue to block the removal of the carbon tax\u201d or \u201callow the carbon tax to be removed immediately\u201d. About 53% of the weighted sample favoured allowing speedy removal of the carbon price, while 35% preferred blocking the move; 12% were uncommitted. The PUP leader, Clive Palmer, tweeted on Monday: \"The @PalmerUtdParty senators will stay true to people who elected them despite pressure from govt or foreign media owners @rupertmurdoch\" Broken down by party support, 53% of Labor backers favoured blocking tactics while 33% preferred repeal; and 85% of Coalition voters wanted immediate repeal compared with 8% for blocking. In a sign of generational differences over climate change policy, older voters were more likely than younger people to signal support for immediate repeal. The results coincided with the fortnightly Newspoll survey showing most indicators of political support remained relatively stable, with Labor poised to win a hypothetical election held now. That would make it a highly risky proposition for the government to call a double-dissolution election if the Senate continued to frustrate its agenda, including numerous unpopular budget measures. The Coalition\u2019s primary vote edged up one point to 36% since the previous fortnight\u2019s survey, while Labor remained steady on 37%, the Greens dropped two points to 11%, and backing for others (including the PUP) rose one point to 16%. Based on preference flows at the last election, these figures translate to a two-party-preferred Labor lead over the Coalition of 54% to 46%. The Coalition won the September election with a commanding lead of 53.5% to 46.5% after the distribution of preferences. Tony Abbott improved on the question of who would make a better prime minister. About 36% of respondents nominated Abbott \u2013 up two points since the last Newspoll. But the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, remained ahead as preferred prime minister with 41% selecting him, although this figure was three points lower than a fortnight ago. Satisfaction with Abbott\u2019s performance level remained steady at 31%, while dissatisfaction with the way he was doing his job dropped two points to 60% \u2013 a net approval score of minus 29. Satisfaction with the way Shorten was doing his job as opposition leader was steady at 34%, while dissatisfaction rose two points to 43% \u2013 a net approval rating of minus nine. The Newspoll table published in The Australian indicated the survey of political support was based on telephone interviews with 1,159 people and had a margin of error of three points. The PUP carbon tax questions involved a higher number of respondents. Both sets of questions were posed between Friday and Sunday. The surveys followed a week in which Abbott hosted the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who delivered a historic address to the Australian parliament and signed a trade agreement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
