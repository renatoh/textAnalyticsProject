The road, a small bridge it once crossed, the guesthouse and hundreds of people were all swallowed by mud when a tailings dam at the C\u00f3rrego de Feij\u00e3o mine collapsed on Friday, unleashing a torrent of liquid waste. As the last of the daylight slipped away, a Red Cross team lugged another body in a bag across the devastated landscape and deposited it gently at the roadside for collection. Three days after what seems likely to become Brazil\u2019s worst ever environmental catastrophe, Red Cross rescue worker Walter Moraes said the victim was \u201capparently\u201d a man. \u201cIt is already decomposing,\u201d he said. Hundreds more bodies remain buried. But finding the missing victims poses an almost impossible challenge for the recovery crews: the disaster sent 11.7 m cubic meters (413 m cubic ft) of mining waste thundering through the valley, swamping houses and leaving a sea of clotting mud up to 8m (26ft) deep in some places. So far, 60 bodies have been found near Brumadinho in Minas Gerais state. But, as of Monday afternoon, 292 people were still missing \u2013 and hopes were fading fast that there will be any survivors. Nobody has been brought out of the disaster area alive since Saturday. Frustrated with official rescue efforts, some locals have started searching for bodies themselves, said Petterson Chaves, 23, who stood watching nearby. \u201cThe people can\u2019t stand there waiting for friends and relatives,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re out there hunting [for them].\u201d Among the missing is Chaves\u2019s aunt Elisabeth Reis, 49, a cook at the opencast mining complex where the 86-metre-high tailings dam collapsed on Friday afternoon, releasing the devastating red wave. Reis worked at the site\u2019s canteen, which was full of workers having lunch when the disaster struck. Just last week, she had told relatives she wanted to leave her job at the end of the year, after paying off a car loan and finishing off her roof. \u201cShe was scared the dam would fail,\u201d he said. The Brumadinho disaster came just three years after the collapse of another tailings dam, near the town of Mariana, also in Minas Gerais. That disaster killed 19 people, polluted the drinking water to hundreds of thousands, and sent mud hundreds of kilometres downriver to the sea. Nobody has ever been convicted of any responsibility for the Mariana disaster. The Mariana dam was owned by a joint venture between BHP Billiton and the Brazilian mining company Vale, which also owns the Brumadinho dam. Locals simply cannot believe that the same thing has happened again: another tailings dam, in the same state. Jane Luzzi, 51, escaped by the skin of her teeth when the mud roared past her rural community of Parque de Cachoeira, taking the house where she made snacks to sell with it. No siren sounded to warn her: instead she got a breathless voice message via WhatsApp from her landlady. \u201cJane,\u201d her landlady shouted. \u201cThe dam has burst. Get out of there quick, in the name of Jesus!\u201d Luzzi grabbed her husband, Nilton de Freitas, 64, and they fled, shouting at neighbours as they went. Now, all she has left was in a plastic bag at her feet. Under the hot afternoon sun, Luzzi\u2019s anger boiled over. \u201cThey think the people under that dam are insects,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere is the United Nations? Where are the people who work with human rights?\u201d Officials have not yet concluded why the dam failed, but the attorney general, Raquel Dodge, has promised to launch an investigation. \u201cSomeone is definitely at fault,\u201d she said. Before the disaster, the river which ran through Parque de Cachoeira ran with crystalline water \u2013 clear enough to see fish swimming, said Adriano Souza, 36, a local builder and painter who has been helping hunt for bodies. His cellphone was filled with grim videos and pictures of broken bodies in the mud, along with a mud-caked child who had been rescued alive. Souza stood watching a rescue helicopter hovering above the acrid sludge. \u201cIf we have any contact with it we have to wash ourselves and wipe down with alcohol,\u201d said Souza. As the sun dipped over the trees, three young men waded into the mud to point out a human leg they had found. A police helicopter descended and an officer in green overalls marked its location with a striped pole. \u201cWe found two bodies today,\u201d said Afonso Ferreira, 20, as he waded out, his bare legs caked in red filth. \u201cYou can\u2019t recognise them.\u201d Up close, the mud irritates the eyes and throat due to the low pH levels in iron ore mining waste, said Mark Macklin, a professor of physical geography at the University of Lincoln who has studied tailings dam disasters for decades and is director of the university\u2019s new Water and Planetary Health centre. Residents have described fish dying in the nearby Paraopeba river while others circulated cellphone videos of fish leaping out of the water to flap on its banks. \u201cThe fish will be choking because of the very high sediment loads in the river that simply stops the fish from breathing. They die from lack of oxygen,\u201d Macklin said. \u201cThere were many dead fish, fish suffocating, fish jumping out of the water. I have lived here 58 years and I have never seen a scene like this,\u201d said Ouvido Gomes, 68, a carpenter. Compounding the anger building in the region is the fact that some locals had already protested against the dams which they feared could collapse. Bruna Coelho, 23, an unemployed biologist who grew up in the region, took part in some of the protests. \u201cWe were very worried, especially after Mariana. Everyone who lives near tailings dams was worried,\u201d she said. So far, Vale has denied any suggestion that the company might bear some responsibility for the Brumadinho disaster. In interviews, Vale\u2019s CEO, F\u00e1bio Schvartsman, has referred to the tragedy as an \u201caccident\u201d. \u201cVale does not see any decisive reasons for its responsibility. There was no negligence, recklessness, malpractice,\u201d S\u00e9rgio Bermudes, a lawyer for Vale, told the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper. Vale soon moved to distance themselves from the comments. \u201cVale clarifies that it did not authorise third parties, including contracted lawyers, to talk in its name,\u201d the company said in a statement on Monday, insisting that it will continue contributing to investigations and supporting affected families. Marina Silva, the former environmental minister and presidential candidate, said congress should bear part of the blame for not toughening regulations and enforcement. \u201cAll the warnings have been given. We are repeating history with this tragedy,\u201d she told the Associated Press. \u201cBrazil can\u2019t become a specialist in rescuing victims and consoling widows. Measures need to be taken to avoid prevent this from happening again.\u201d This article was amended on 6 February 2019 to clarify that the mud irritates the eyes and throat due to the low pH levels in iron ore mining waste, not high levels."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
