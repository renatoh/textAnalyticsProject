Hazard has filled in as a central striker in recent games against Barcelona and Manchester City, suggesting post-match at the Etihad Stadium that he could have played \u201cfor three hours\u201d and still would not have touched the ball. Chelsea\u2019s leading scorer had been more effective against Bar\u00e7a but still complained the majority of passes aimed at him had been \u201cflying towards my head\u201d, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s not really playing to my qualities.\u201d Conte is expected to start with Olivier Giroud at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday, when he may rest one or two players before Wednesday\u2019s return leg in the Champions League at the Camp Nou. Yet there remains the possibility Hazard will be restored to a central brief in future. \u201cIf I think it\u2019s right for the team to play in this way [with a false No 9], I will,\u201d Conte said. \u201cOtherwise I can play with a striker. Olivier has specific characteristics. He\u2019s a strong player and has lots of physicality so in some games, it\u2019s right to start with him. \u201cIn other games, it\u2019s right to start with \u00c1lvaro Morata. In others, it\u2019s right to continue with Hazard as a No 9. The tactics [at City] were the same against Barcelona and after that game, I didn\u2019t hear anyone complaining.\u201d The head coach noted Hazard\u2019s observations last weekend and, although he did not feel compelled to address those frustrations with the player at Cobham, he recalled the occasion when he had commented publicly on his manager\u2019s approach. \u201cI did this when I was a player once: at Juventus, with [Marcello] Lippi, we played a massive game against Parma when they were first and we were second. After the game, there was an international break and I gave an interview. The journalists asked me if I was happy. My stupid answer was: \u2018We are winning but I\u2019m not happy because I\u2019m not enjoying the role the coach decided to give me.\u2019 \u201cWhen I came back to Turin Lippi killed me. He killed me in a bad way, in front of the players. He told me it was a lack of respect for my team-mates, first of all, and then for him, the club and the fans. After training the club fined me. And then, in the next game, I was on the bench. I\u2019m talking about myself [not Hazard] but, up to that point in my career I was selfish. After that I started to think for the benefit of the team.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
