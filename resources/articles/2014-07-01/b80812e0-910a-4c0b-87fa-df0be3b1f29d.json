It ranges over the centuries and across the world, from Charles Ives\u2019s In Flanders Fields to Wolfgang Rihm and Roger Quilter. Anna Prohaska\u2019s glittering soprano is hard-hitting in four Hanns Eisler songs, and while she finds an unearthly purity in Schubert\u2019s Ellens Gesang I, she is as pungent in Kurt Weill\u2019s settings of Whitman as she is cool in Michael Cavendish\u2019s ancient lute song Wand\u2019ring in This Place. The imagination and care that has gone into this compilation is exceptional, and the results are totally compelling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
