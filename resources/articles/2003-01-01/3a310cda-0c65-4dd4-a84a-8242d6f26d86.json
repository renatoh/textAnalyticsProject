The 20-year-old Vittek, who plays for Slovan Bratislava, is on trial at St Andrews with a view to a possible \u00a32.3m move. If that deal materialises, it is unlikely to mark the end of Birmingham's spending spree. Their manager Steve Bruce is optimistic about signing a Premiership defender, thought to be Arsenal's Matthew Upson, by the weekend. Birmingham entertain the Gunners on Sunday and Clapham, who has cost \u00a31.3m and the \u00a3900,000 Clemence, will be available to make their debuts, subject to passing medicals today. Both play in midfield, although Clapham is also happy at left-back, and their arrival has allowed Birmingham to release Darryl Powell when his loan spell runs out at the weekend. Powell, whose contract with Derby County expired in the summer, has been a regular for Birmingham since last September. Derby meanwhile are expected to receive an increased bid from Southampton for Danny Higginbotham but it will not match the debt-ridden club's \u00a32.5m valuation of the defender. The Rams, who owe \u00a320m, rejected Southampton's initial \u00a3700,000 bid for their 24-year-old player of the year earlier this week. They at least want to break even on Higginbotham who cost them \u00a32m when he moved to Pride Park from Manchester United two years ago. But Southampton's next offer will fall a long way short of Derby's price tag. \"We expect to make another bid but there is a big difference what Derby want and what we are willing to pay,\" the Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
