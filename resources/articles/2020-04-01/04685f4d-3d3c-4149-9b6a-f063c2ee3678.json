In a letter written shortly after their wedding, Florence Dugdale portrayed Hardy as \u201cone of the kindest, most humane men in the world\u201d while acknowledging that his fame led to the constant attention of the press in the UK and US. A letter sent after Hardy\u2019s death includes a vivid image of her sitting in the room where she first met her late husband, a French bulldog snoring by the fire as her only companion. Hardy\u2019s first marriage \u2013 to Emma Gifford \u2013 has tended to garner more attention, partly because so much of his great work, including the elegiac \u201cPoems of 1912-13\u201d, was inspired by her. Academics believe the three recently found letters are significant because they offer fresh insight into his relationship with Florence, a teacher and author, in his later years. The first letter was sent by Florence from Max Gate, Hardy\u2019s home on the outskirts of Dorchester in Dorset on 10 February 1914 to a former pupil of hers called Harold Barlow, who was away working in Africa. Florence wrote: \u201cPerhaps you have read, if you have the English papers, that I am now the proud and very happy wife of the greatest living English writer \u2013 Thomas Hardy. \u201cAlthough he is much older than myself, it is a genuine love match \u2013 on my part, at least, for I suppose I ought not to speak for him. At any rate I know I have for a husband one of the kindest, most humane men in the world.\u201d Florence also wrote about how she was weary of celebrity culture and the media: \u201cAccounts of me &amp; my portrait have been printed in every paper, I think, in England. I have been shown in the Cinematograph, written about all over America &amp; Europe. I am tired of this publicity.\u201d The letters were kept by Barlow\u2019s daughter, Josephine Barlow, and found after her death by his grandsons, Ian and Colin Nicol. The letters have been passed to Prof Angelique Richardson, of the University of Exeter, who is leading the Hardy\u2019s Correspondents Project, as part of which letters connected to the author are being digitised. Richardson said: \u201cIt is rare to find such significant letters. They give an intimate glimpse into life at Max Gate and the loves and losses Florence shared with Hardy. It also shows us more about Florence, how self-deprecating she was and how devoted she was to her husband.\u201d The second and third letters to Barlow were written 18 years later, in 1932, four years after Hardy\u2019s death. She said: \u201cI am writing this late in the evening alone, in the room where I first met my husband. A little French bull-dog is snoring by the fire \u2013 he is my faithful \u2013 &amp; generally my only \u2013 companion.\u201d Florence added: \u201cI thank you for your kind words of sympathy about my great loss. It was such a wonderful thing to live in close association with that great mind &amp; that noble personality. After having lived 14 years with such a companion it is little wonder that I feel intolerably lonely \u2013 &amp; find the world very empty.\u201d Harold\u2019s 16-year-old daughter, Josephine, wrote movingly to Florence, in 1947, full of admiration for Hardy. But the letter arrived 10 years after Florence\u2019s death and was returned to the sender. The words: \u201chouse emty\u201d [sic] can be seen on the envelope written by a postal worker. The letters will be placed with the rest of Dorset Museum\u2019s Hardy Collection."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
