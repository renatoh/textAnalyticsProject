As if being bankrupt of scoring ideas were not harrowing enough, further trauma lies in wait judging by the news seeping out of Elland Road that they are about to announce the worst financial results in Premiership history. By the week of Halloween, when Professor John McKenzie takes a deep breath and releases the figures, Leeds's debts may be up from \u00a379m to close to \u00a3100m and any trick-or-treaters knocking on the chairman's door will be lucky to get a Wagon Wheel. The full details of their impoverished state will not be known until a statement is released to the Stock Exchange tomorrow week but the horrors to come were confirmed at boardroom level on Saturday and McKenzie's reaction told its own story. The chairman made a great play of pointing out that he had been in office for only three months of the past financial year, indicating that the blame lay with his predecessor Peter Ridsdale. The results \"will not show a dramatic turnaround,\" said McKenzie, adding that \"you don't turn around a tanker in two minutes\". A nice theory, except that Leeds, both on and off the field, are more like a leaky dinghy right now, and there may not be enough life-jackets to go around. They did not, in mitigation, resemble a bottom-three side yesterday on the pitch, but there was such an imbalance of talent between them and Manchester United that it cannot be discounted that they will finish the season with their toes tagged for the relegation morgue. And then what? McKenzie, for one, has already contemplated the worst-case scenario, one that combines demotion to the First Division, the likelihood of then going into administration and, under the Football League's new rules, the 10-point deduction that might follow. \"It would be very difficult to survive,\" he admitted. \"There would have to be savage cuts and big changes, even what you charge the fans for seats. It would be a sad day for Leeds. But every time a goal goes in against us you fear about the direction we're going.\" It says much that David Batty was by far their most effective player yet belonged to a midfield quartet who were so overwhelmed that Peter Reid asked his striker Alan Smith to drop back to man-mark Roy Keane. Defying his creaking limbs, Keane had begun the match by nutmegging Mark Viduka and, together with Paul Scholes, was the catalyst for a controlled victory, albeit one that took longer than anticipated to achieve. Reid used words such as \"committed\" and said he \"could not criticise his players\". The Leeds manager is also entitled to feel there was a minor personal triumph, with not a single question about his job prospects in the post-match press conference and even a half-apology from McKenzie, who admitted he may have been \"naive\" in his handling of the sacking-that-never-was. Perhaps this is why the Leeds plc board is contemplating offering Trevor Birch, previously the chief executive at Chelsea, a similar role at Elland Road. Deep down, though, Reid will know it was a deceptively narrow winning margin. One-nil was no disgrace, but it probably should have been worse and doubtless would have been if Scholes's late shot had not come back off the crossbar, if Salomon Olemb\u00e9 had not cleared Ruud van Nistelrooy's shot off the goal-line, or if, in the first half, Graham Poll had not been so suspicious of Cristiano Ronaldo's motives for his two penalty appeals. Poll, it must be noted, was excellent, although Ronaldo could argue there was definitely a brush from Gary Kelly on both occasions. To the consternation of Sir Alex Ferguson the teenager is becoming a victim of his own reputation. But whose fault is that? Ronaldo is suffering the consequences of his own actions; even Keane admonished his team-mate for one exaggerated fall. Keane then headed in the solitary goal. He probably cut the half-time oranges, too. In fact he was so instrumental in everything it would have been no surprise to see him driving the team coach back across the Pennines. Tim Howard, meanwhile, was so redundant in goal that he may feel a wince of embarrassment when he collects his weekly wages. When Keane emerged through a thicket of players to convert Gary Neville's cross, Viduka had already gone off with cramp (don't you have to run around to get cramp?) and that was just about that - Manchester United's finest Premiership start for a decade.
