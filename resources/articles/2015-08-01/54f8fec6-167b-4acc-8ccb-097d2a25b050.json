Tony Dolphin, the IPPR\u2019s chief economist, said that while the government tends to target support at the highly skilled workers in advanced manufacturing, it is the low-paid staff behind bars and checkouts whose performance may be critical to sustaining Britain\u2019s recovery. While manufacturers often have a strong incentive to improve their performance, because they must compete with more efficient foreign firms, \u201cthe same pressure does not exist across large parts of the domestic service sector economy, in areas such as hospitality, accommodation, parts of retailing and the care industry, which employ millions more people than what is left of our manufacturing industry,\u201d he said. The IPPR called on the government to \u201cthink more carefully about how its spending can help to boost productivity in these sectors of the economy\u201d. In the years 1979 to 2007, Britain\u2019s productivity expanded at an average annual rate of 2.3% in terms of worker output per hour, helping to drive rising living standards. Since then, it has fallen, by an average of 0.1% a year. The unexpected failure of output-per-hour to rebound after the financial crisis has been dubbed the \u201cproductivity puzzle\u201d. That has opened up a gap with rival economies, threatening the sustainability of the economic upturn, which has so far been driven largely by a rapid increase in the number of people in jobs. The average German worker now produces 23% more output per hour than their British counterpart; a US worker as much as a third more, according to data from the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Dolphin has analysed rival explanations of this \u201cproductivity puzzle\u201d in detail, in a new study. He found that collapsing productivity in the North Sea oil sector \u2013 as remaining reserves become harder to extract \u2013 and in the financial sector \u2013 as the legacy of the crash plays out \u2013 must take part of the blame. Several other sectors, including retail and transport, also saw productivity fall sharply when the crisis hit. Since the recovery got underway in 2011, though, Dolphin said that another important explanation has been the rapid growth of employment in relatively low-productivity sectors. \u201cWhile jobs growth may have been strong during these three years of decent economic growth, it was disproportionately in low value-added \u2013 and low-paid \u2013 sectors of the economy,\u201d Dolphin said. It is hard to unravel the direction of causation, whether low-paid workers tend to be less productive, as firms take on cheap staff instead of investing in new hi-tech equipment; or low productivity prevents employers from giving their staff a pay rise. But Dolphin said the chancellor\u2019s bold decision to raise the minimum wage to \u00a39 by 2020 could help, by giving firms an incentive to invest in technology and training to get more out of their lower-paid staff, who will gradually become more costly to employ. \u201cProvided that it does not lead to rising prices, this welcome move will put pressure on firms to boost productivity in order to maintain their profit margins,\u201d the report said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
