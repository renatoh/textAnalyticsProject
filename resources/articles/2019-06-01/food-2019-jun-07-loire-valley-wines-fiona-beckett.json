A Loire wine (probably a sancerre) may well have been one of the first bottles you felt confident enough to order on a wine list, but you rarely come across them nowadays. According to Pierpaolo Petrassi, head buyer of Waitrose\u2019s wine department, who claims the supermarket sells 70% of the wines from the region, \u201cthe rest of the market has forgotten about the Loire.\u201d Which is surprising given the fashionability of the area\u2019s signature sauvignon blanc. I\u2019ve felt a bit disillusioned in the recent past, too. So often, sancerre, which now routinely fetches \u00a317-\u00a318 a bottle, doesn\u2019t live up to its reputation. But tasting through Waitrose\u2019s Loire range the other day, I kept thinking they were just lovely: fresh, fragrant and summery, and exactly the kind of wines I want to drink at this time of year. (I\u2019ve jumped the gun slightly with this week\u2019s recommendations, because some won\u2019t be on shelf for a good couple of weeks yet, but look out, in particular, for the very good value La Perri\u00e8re Touraine Sauvignon Blanc, on offer at \u00a37.49 from the 17th; and a delicious, near-dry vouvray from Domaine des Aubuisi\u00e8res, Cuv\u00e9e de Silex 2018, which will also be on sale that week at \u00a311.99.) The Wine Society is also strong on the Loire, with more than 80 lines, including no fewer than eight pouilly-fum\u00e9s, among them the incredibly delicious Domaine de Riaux . The Society is also good on less well-known appellations such as its bestselling 12.5% cheverny from Domaine du Salvard 2018, which could easily pass for sancerre, despite its modest \u00a39.50 price tag; and the glorious, cherry-scented, \u00a310.95 Chinon Temps de Cerises (13.5%), of which you can temptingly also buy by the half-bottle for \u00a36.25. Chinon also produces a tiny amount of white (just 2% of the total appellation) and you can buy a wonderful example from another Loire specialist, Yapp Brothers, though even they\u2019ve majored more on Rh\u00f4ne and Languedoc wines in recent years. And I love their delicate Reuilly Ros\u00e9, which is surprisingly made from pinot gris (aka pinot grigio) but is bone dry. I haven\u2019t even touched on fizz (though I\u2019m not a big fan of sparkling saumur), sweet wines or natural wines, of which the region has more than its fair share. There\u2019s still a lot to love about the Loire. Four wines to enjoy from the Loire this summer Domaine de Riaux Pouilly- Fum\u00e9 \u00a315.50 Wine Society, 13%. Everything you want from a Loire sauvignon blanc: fresh, crisp, citrussy, summery. The perfect wine for fresh crab. Chinon Jean-Maurice Raffault 2018 \u00a314.95 Yapp Brothers, 12.5%. A rare white chinon. Pure, pristine chenin blanc. Would be lovely with creamily sauced fish. Domaine des Ormes Saumur Rouge 2016 \u00a38 Co-op, 12.5%. Well-priced, light, crunchy cab franc for lovers of Loire reds. Great for a picnic. Reuilly Ros\u00e9 Gerard Cordier 2018 \u00a313.75 Yapp Brothers, 13.5%. Pretty, delicate, creamy, a whiff of wild strawberries. A top ap\u00e9ro. \u2022 For more by Fiona Beckett, go to matchingfoodandwine.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
