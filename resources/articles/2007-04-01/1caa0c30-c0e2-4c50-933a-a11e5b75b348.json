Whitehall, like Moscow, has its Siberian power stations, and certainly knows how to make non-persons. One day you're on your way to a permanent secretary's briefcase, the next day nary a mention - your picture expunged from the website, your existence rubbed from the record. Take the case of Comrade David Myers. Until mid-March, he was a coming man, the director of shared services in the Cabinet Office, just off to extol the government's vision at a jamboree in Barcelona. Then, suddenly, he was gone. No press release, no fond farewells. Put his name in the Cabinet Office search engine and you get a solitary mention of his name, buried deep in a file. The date on the website gives a clue as to why: the shared services section has not been updated for months. Shared services, once the great white hope for efficiency and cost saving, the subject of agitated chatter from ministers and business, is yesterday's news. The neologists have moved on. In the dull months between Blair and Brown, great ships have been becalmed, and some - shared services is one - have sunk without trace. Shared services were once going to conquer. Instead of employing its own staff to run payroll or personnel, or a press office, a government department should buy in the service at lower cost from a specialist offering economies of scale. It wasn't necessarily outsourcing, since a big department - work and pensions, say - could do the work on behalf of smaller fry, such as culture and sport. Hampshire would take in the IT or council tax processing required by Basingstoke or Winchester. Myers, who had been IT chief in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, after working for Accenture consultancy, became the government-wide advocate, located at the right hand of Ian Watmore, head of the prime minister's delivery unit. He went into overdrive. Billions could be saved off \"corporate services\". Government agencies, he fantasised, would become skeletal bodies, in between frontline service providers and a small number of shared services providers. Why couldn't Whitehall operate with a single source of these clerical functions? Contractors queued up to provide the IT and systems advice, as well as the services themselves. Shared services implied job cuts, reorganisation and empire diminution. Applied with rigour, it would have eviscerated Whitehall departments and agencies, and left some district councils as mere shells. The logic of reform went in its direction. Amid the suggestions last year from Sir David Varney, the former head of HM Revenue &amp; Customs, for making services more customer-friendly was the dissolution of departmental boundaries - between tax and benefits, say - that made no sense to the public. That would be easier if the common clerical work done in HMRC and in work and pensions were already shared. An obvious line to explain why shared services, along with Myers, bit the dust would be public service inertia. But there are subtler reasons. In a sort of way, Myers was a statist, believing government to be a single entity. Advocates of more \"joining up\" think the same. But administrative reality is disaggregated. Individual agencies put out mission statements and encourage their staff to be \"committed\" to them. It's much easier to feel passionate about, say, the Environment Agency or even National Savings than bigger, baggier entities such as the UK state or the crown. And, as a result, you are going to be none too keen on sharing services or divvying up the work to the benefit of some other bit of the government. Last week, Derby city council announced a deal with a firm called Affiniti for combining communications and IT, with the new network providing for 47 other councils in the east Midlands. But will Nottingham, arch rival in the region, really want to buy? Would the city's councillors really get away with telling citizens their payments were being routed to Derby for processing? Shared services are emblematic of the hyper-rationalism that has characterised public service reform - an approach that often has no place for feeling or values. It's also founded on a public/private paradox. Imagine Tesco farming its finance function out to Wal-Mart. It might conceivably outsource aspects of its work, but would be very upset if the provider were also doing business with a rival. Somehow, with shared services, rivalry and competition were not to apply in the public sector - a nonsense when public bodies are being urged to compete at every turn. \u00b7 David Walker is editor of the Guardian's Public magazine \u00b7 Email your comments to society@theguardian.com.
