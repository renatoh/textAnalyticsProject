With just over a week to go, Labour has turned to retail politics, trying to sell the country on the financial benefit of its policies \u2013 while the prime minister does his best to dodge his old friend Donald Trump out of fear the president could say something that might hurt his election chances. We have the best of other news \u2013 including the Trump impeachment report \u2013 and you can read rolling updates of the day\u2019s political news at our live blog. What\u2019s going on? Labour will today try to convince voters of the financial benefit of electing a Corbyn government. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will say his party\u2019s policies would save families an average of \u00a36,700 a year by \u201cputting a stop to rip-off Britain\u201d as Labour narrows its focus to bread-and-butter issues. In a dossier to be published alongside the speech, McDonnell will claim that policies including nationalising utilities and reducing the cost of rail season tickets \u2013 as well as free childcare for all two- to four-year-olds, free prescription charges and free school meals \u2013 would help the hip pocket of average households. However, Labour candidates are privately concerned about the scattergun nature of the giveaways, with one saying the manifesto, while good, is \u201cjust long and confusing\u201d and some promises could appear too good to be true. Trump\u2019s presence in the UK for Nato talks continues to loom over the election. The summit started with heated exchanges and further tensions are expected as leaders meet again today. Trump is seen as an electoral liability for the Conservatives over fears that he may be interested in putting the NHS on the table in US-UK trade talks \u2013 though yesterday the president categorically denied the US was interested in the health service. Boris Johnson has so far managed to keep his distance from the US president, with Marina Hyde writing that Johnson will continue to studiously avoid the president because \u201cTories sense even a handshake with Trump could piss their electoral bed\u201d. At a glance Both Labour and Tory migration plans \u201cwould worsen NHS staffing\u201d, says the Nuffield Trust. The Tories have announced \u00a34bn for public transport in the Midlands and north. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Labour member and my family has always voted Labour,\u201d says Michael O\u2019Neill, but he is one of many in Bishop Auckland expected to vote Conservative for the first time. Jeremy Corbyn has apologised for antisemitic incidents in his party, with Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby succeeding where Andrew Neil failed. Maybe it was the sofa, writes John Crace. Steve Coogan and Naomi Klein are among cultural figures who say they will be voting Labour, in a letter published in the Guardian. And a story to give you a chuckle over your breakfast: a Tory councillor climbed some bins and scaled a school fence to escape a climate crisis debate after she met with a crowd unimpressed with her answers. The day ahead The prime minister\u2019s time will be split between campaigning in the home counties and hosting leaders for the Nato summit. Jeremy Corbyn is campaigning in the East Midlands, while John McDonnell gives a speech on the economy in the West Midlands outlining how Labour\u2019s policies will save average people money. In the Lib Dem camp, Jo Swinson will visit a youth centre in London and then sit down for her Andrew Neil interview, which will be broadcast at 7.30pm. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, will speak at a public meeting in Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire in the morning while the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, will campaign in Edinburgh and the Ulster Unionist party will launch its manifesto in Belfast.

Best of the rest &gt; The US House intelligence committee has voted to adopt Democrats\u2019 damning 300-page impeachment report, moving the inquiry into Donald Trump\u2019s conduct towards its next phase. Trump \u201cabused the power of his office for personal and political gain, at the expense of [US] national security\u201d, the report concludes. It all goes to the judiciary committee next, and then the full House could vote on articles of impeachment by the end of the year. &gt; Thousands of people in the UK are having their appendix removed unnecessarily, surgeons say. A third of women and 12% of men going in for the surgery end up having a normal appendix removed. Study co-author Aneel Bhangu of the University of Birmingham said: \u201cThis is a situation where change can be brought about that will save the NHS potentially millions of pounds a year.\u201d But Prof Neil Mortensen, vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons, defended the status quo, saying serious complications from removing an appendix were rare but \u201cmissing a case of appendicitis is potentially life-threatening and it can also result in infertility in females\u201d. &gt; All four artists shortlisted for the 2019 Turner prize have been named joint winners and shared the \u00a340,000 prize after they made a plea for judges to recognise the causes of \u201ccommonality, multiplicity and solidarity\u201d in what has been a divisive year. The quartet are Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Oscar Murillo and Tai Shani. Guardian art critic Adrian Searle says that for an award with a colourful history this year\u2019s result could be the upset to end them all.

Lunchtime read: Attack of the drones The technology of swarming \u2013 drones deployed in squadrons, able to think independently and operate as a pack \u2013 is in its infancy, but armed forces around the world, including in the UK, are investing millions of pounds in its development. Israel is already using hordes of drones to overwhelm Syrian air defences, and they have been directed at Russian forces in Syria as well as oil facilities in Saudi Arabia. According to analysts, drone swarms of the future could have the capacity to assess targets, divide up tasks and execute them with limited human interaction, writes Michael Safi. Sport Pep Guardiola stated it would be \u201ccrazy\u201d for Manchester City to think about retaining the title due to the deficit to Liverpool, which is eight points after Tuesday\u2019s win at Burnley. At Selhurst Park, Crystal Palace had Mamadou Sakho sent off in the 19th minute but still managed to beat Bournemouth 1-0 on a night Amazon Prime crept into football\u2019s broadcast jungle. Anthony Joshua has predicted a trilogy of fights with Andy Ruiz Jr, whatever the result of their clash on Saturday.

For the second time in less than two years England\u2019s Test team have left New Zealand with a 1-0 series defeat to show for their efforts as a supposed new era got off to a flat start.

And the 2019 Formula One Esports series will come to a climax at a shopping centre in west London today, with prize money of $500,000 (\u00a3385,000) up for grabs. Business Asian shares sold off heavily overnight after Donald Trump surprised traders by saying that a trade deal with China could wait until after next year\u2019s presidential election. The uncertainty was compounded when the US House of Representatives passed a bill that could require Trump to sanction members of the politburo for their treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang. Beijing reacted furiously. The FTSE100 is set open flat despite the excitement in Asia while the pound edged above $1.30 and is sitting at \u20ac1.173. The papers What Donald Trump said about the NHS, and whether you\u2019d believe him, is the theme today. The Sun\u2019s position seems to be that if the president said it, it must be true: \u201cTrump thumps chump over NHS lies\u201d. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want NHS on silver platter\u201d says the Express. \u201cWe have no interest in the NHS\u201d is the Telegraph\u2019s splash headline. The Guardian reports that the Labour leader intends to press the president over his trade machinations. The paper\u2019s headline is \u201cCorbyn ups pressure over NHS as Trump rows back\u201d. The Metro splashes with \u201cCorbyn casts doubt on Trump\u2019s NHS pledge\u201d and adds in a subhead that Tories admit medicines from US drug companies could cost more after Brexit. \u201cWe\u2019ll force tech firms to pay more, says PM\u201d is the take in the Times on Boris Johnson\u2019s pledge to have the Googles and the Facebooks of the world make a \u201cfairer contribution\u201d, which the paper says runs the risk of a rift with Trump who has threatened France with tariffs for doing the same. The Mail sounds the alarm bell over a \u201cDeadly gamble on our health\u201d as an NHS report ties online betting in with social scourges including heavy drinking, obesity and chronic disease. \u201cLabour to put \u00a36,176 in your pocket\u201d says the Mirror as it tots up the benefits of Corbyn\u2019s plans to end \u201crip-off Britain\u201d.
