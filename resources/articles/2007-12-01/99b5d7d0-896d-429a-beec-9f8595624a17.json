The prophets of doom could not foresee progress without major investment but the manager insisted he had the situation in hand. Wenger had made just two significant signings but asked people to remember how many Manchester United had made the previous summer, as they prepared to make up ground on Chelsea and challenge for the title. United, he pointed out, had added only Michael Carrick, the midfielder, yet they had improved to the extent that they did win the championship, for the ninth time under Sir Alex Ferguson. The parallels between Ferguson's fine-tuning back then and Wenger's this time round are becoming increasingly clear. And if Carrick's impact was subtle and largely unsung, then the same is true of Bacary Sagna, Wenger's \u00a36m capture from Auxerre. While the striker Eduardo da Silva, Arsenal's other high-profile summer signing, has shown but flickers of his class so far, Sagna has slotted in seamlessly at right-back. The 24-year-old from Sens, a small town outside Auxerre, describes himself as a long-time lover of English football and, over the past two seasons, it was clear to Gilles Grimandi, the Arsenal scout, and Wenger that he had the physical attributes to succeed in the Premier League. Grimandi watched him more than 30 times at Auxerre and became convinced that he would prove a shrewd purchase. Yet Sagna's adaptation has been almost indecent in its haste. He has played in all but one of Arsenal's Premier League matches this season, in their march to the top of the table, and he is comfortable with talk of the title. Arsenal have cleared every obstacle put in their path thus far; the derbies at Tottenham and West Ham, the clashes against Liverpool and Manchester United and, most recently, the trip to Aston Villa on Saturday, when they won 2-1 and, in the first half at least, played football from a higher plane. Sagna recognises the importance of tonight's visit to Newcastle United and he believes that it offers another opportunity to demonstrate championship credentials. \"The Aston Villa game was the type of game that championship-winning sides win,\" he said. \"You need to win the difficult games, you cannot only win the easy ones and it was very important to win there. Now, we want to win at Newcastle and take three more points on [Manchester] United. We want to stay at the top. I want to play better and better and I would like to win the Premier League in my first year.\" Sagna was born to Senegalese parents and his father wrote to Bruno Metsu, the Senegal manager, asking that his son be considered for selection. There was never any reply and, after breaking through at Auxerre, Sagna was persuaded by his manager, Guy Roux, and Ren\u00e9 Girard, the France Under-21 coach, to play for the country of his birth. Senegal's frantic calls came too late. Sagna wants to finish his debut season in the Premier League with a place in the France squad for the Euro 2008 finals next summer. Willy Sagnol, the first-choice right-back, has recovered from serious injury but has yet to regain his place at Bayern Munich, while Sagna hopes to exploit Fran\u00e7ois Clerc's lack of regular football at Lyon. But Sagna's focus for now is Arsenal. He has become such a fixture in Wenger's first-choice team that when he was rested against Sevilla in the Champions League last Tuesday, it caused eyebrows to be raised. He was missed in the 3-1 defeat. But his performance at Villa Park, laced with power and authority, was arguably his finest of the season. He crossed for Emmanuel Adebayor to head the winner, while his partnership with Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9, who has been moved forward to right midfield to accommodate Sagna, goes from strength to strength. \"I didn't think about the Sevilla defeat, we were only focused on Villa,\" he said. \"This team's main strength is its mental toughness. I like playing with Ebou\u00e9, I think we are very complementary. He can take my place if I go forward. He understands the right-back role and it's double protection for the right-hand side.\" Sagna is considered a model professional, although he did ruffle feathers when he forced through his transfer to Arsenal. Having sold Younes Kaboul to Tottenham, Auxerre had been reluctant to part with their other defensive totem. Sagna, though, refused to be denied his dream move and now is making the most of it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
