In an alarming report they reveal the school workforce is being pushed to \u201cbreaking point\u201d. Education Support, a charity that gives mental health help to education professionals, predicts school standards will fall and mental health problems in the classroom will multiply if the government does not act quickly to offer teachers more support. Seen exclusively by the Observer, the charity\u2019s teacher wellbeing index indicates that stress levels among teachers and school leaders have ratcheted up for the third consecutive year to the highest levels ever. Nearly three-quarters of teachers and 84% of school leaders now describe themselves as \u201cstressed\u201d, and more than a third of education professionals have experienced a mental health issue in the past academic year. Almost half (49%) believe their workplace is having a negative impact on their mental health and wellbeing. \u201cOverwork has become normalised. Education professionals don\u2019t feel trusted,\u201d said the charity\u2019s chief executive, Sin\u00e9ad Mc Brearty. \u201cThey are almost twice as anxious as the general population. That\u2019s a measure of how harsh our accountability systems are and the way in which accountability in education is so reductive. This report has to be a very loud wake-up call for all concerned.\u201d She said the sector was now at breaking point: \u201cWe are beyond \u2018crisis\u2019. We are in a state of distress.\u201d If the situation continued, she warned, it would result in \u201cburnt-out leaders on an industrial scale\u201d and schools would face huge problems recruiting and retaining staff. \u201cWe know that [the] performance of anyone in any job is compromised by stress and poor wellbeing. We are going to see that in our classrooms. As it is, 10 million children are spending a significant amount of time every year in high-stress environments \u2013 and that is going to affect them.\u201d The charity is calling for the government to make educational reforms that will increase teachers\u2019 autonomy and change the accountability system to reduce \u201cunproductive tension and anxiety\u201d. It also wants all school staff, but particularly stressed-out school leaders, to have access to more support and enough funding to prioritise developing healthier workplaces and working practices. More than half (57%) of staff surveyed who have experienced health and emotional pressures have considered leaving the sector in the past two years, the index shows. The volume of workload is cited as the main reason why, closely followed by \u201cnot feeling valued\u201d. Two-thirds also want a better work-life balance, and the majority say they are sick of the target-driven culture and the general lack of resources for schools. This year, teachers are also feeling significantly more tearful, two out of five are having difficulty concentrating, and around half are having difficulty sleeping. \u201cTeachers shrug their shoulders and think: this is what a job in education requires. And it\u2019s not. It is not healthy, not for teachers, not for their family and not for the children they teach,\u201d said Mc Brearty. The charity said it had witnessed unprecedented levels of demand for its services, and has directly supported a record 14,081 teachers and education professionals in the last 12 months. Emma Kell, a secondary school teacher and author of How to Survive in Teaching, said she had felt constantly stressed while working a 70-hour week \u2013 and not just because of the workload. \u201cIt was the feeling of never being trusted, and my voice not being heard,\u201d she said, adding that Education Support had helped her to survive. Everything she did had to be turned into a set of data to prove it had been carried out. \u201cI was being constantly monitored and told off. I had no professional control at all.\u201d She stopped sleeping properly and lost weight but refused to quit because she didn\u2019t want to let her pupils down. \u201cI wish I\u2019d called Education Support earlier. By that stage, I felt I had nowhere else to turn,\u201d she said.
