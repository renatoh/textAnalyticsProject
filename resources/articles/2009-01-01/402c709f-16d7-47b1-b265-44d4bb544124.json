The former captain, 34, went on to praise Pietersen, who succeeded him at the helm of the side when Vaughan himself quit the job last August. \"As England captain he was very forward thinking, very committed, obviously ruffled a few feathers,\" said Vaughan. \"But I don't mind that \u2013 Nasser Hussain did that as captain and did a fantastic job. Graeme Smith has done that for South Africa. \"Everyone has got to be themselves, and Kevin Pietersen tried to do it his way and he said last week in his [newspaper] column that he feels his captaincy days aren't finished yet.\" For now, though, Pietersen will return to the ranks, aiming to add to his 15 Test hundreds and help England develop some winning momentum under the new captain Andrew Strauss following his very public argument with the former coach Peter Moores, who lost his job in the fall-out from the row. \"What they really need is to go out there and play some cricket,\" said Vaughan. \"I just want us to get out there and play, and the boys will just want to get back on to the cricket pitch and win some games. \"I felt for everyone because I don't think anyone has come out of it smelling of roses. It's been a really difficult time for the England team but hopefully we can now move forward.\" Vaughan insists he retains the drive to return to international cricket. He is not in the 16-man Test squad to tour the Caribbean from next week onwards, and is instead with Yorkshire, building up fitness for the 2009 season. Having led England to Ashes victory four years ago, however, he is keen for another shot at the Australians this summer. Despite calls for his inclusion, Vaughan also accepted it was the right decision to omit him from the tour party, saying: \"It's the first time in a long time where I've been able to do normal things. I feel very refreshed and excited \u2013 and that's very important. \"I am 34 and I feel as though I've got a few more years left in me. You have to have that excitement and buzz, and really want to go out there and perform, and I certainly have those feelings.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
