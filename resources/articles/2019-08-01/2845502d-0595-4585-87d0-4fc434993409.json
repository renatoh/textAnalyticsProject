Eschewing the more liberal approach to criminal justice briefly tried when Michael Gove was justice secretary, and prompting Labour criticism about choosing posturing over substance, Johnson said punishments \u201cmust truly fit the crime\u201d. The new policies, following on from a plan for 20,000 extra police officers, were unveiled in a series of supportive newspapers, with accompanying opinion pieces from Johnson and Priti Patel, the home secretary. On sentencing, Johnson announced a review of the policy of allowing some prisoners with a fixed sentence to be released on licence mid-way through their term on condition of continued good behaviour. The review will also look at potentially longer sentences for violent and sexual offences, and for repeat offenders, and includes \u00a385m in extra funding for the Crown Prosecution Service. \u201cDangerous criminals must be kept off our streets, serving the sentences they deserve \u2013 victims want to see it, the public want to see it and I want to see it. To ensure confidence in the system, the punishment must truly fit the crime,\u201d Johnson said. In another arguably populist pre-election move, Johnson and Patel announced that police would be freer to carry out preventive stop-and-search operations under so-called section 60 powers. Stop and search is a controversial tactic and its efficacy on a large scale is in doubt. A Home Office study of its increased use in London when Johnson was mayor found no evidence it had contributed to reducing crime levels. One of Theresa May\u2019s flagship policies as home secretary was to make police use stop and search more selectively in light of statistics showing black people were seven times more likely to be stopped by police than white people, with only about one in 10 of those stops leading to an arrest. But speaking on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, Kit Malthouse, the police minister and a long-time ally of Johnson, said ministers were aware of the sensitivities, arguing that the rollout of body-worn cameras to police would help minimise the chances of the powers being abused. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the case that we have to work very closely with all communities across the country to make sure that stop-and-search is done in a professional and sensitive way,\u201d he said. \u201cThings have changed. The vast majority of uniformed officers now wear a body camera, so the interaction between them and the person who is being searched can be filmed, which will lead to a professionalisation, and in fact a better reaction from the person being searched as well.\u201d Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said extending stop-and-search powers was \u201ca tried and tested recipe for unrest, not violence reduction\u201d. She said: \u201cThis draconian approach shows that Boris Johnson\u2019s government has no real plans to invest in policing or a public health approach to tackling violent crime. They have opted to appear tough instead of dealing with the root causes of crime. \u201cEvidence-based stop and search will always be a vital tool in preventing crime. But random stops have only poisoned police community relations.\u201d The new prisons announcement, for England and Wales, will see a new prison built alongside HMP Full Sutton in Yorkshire, as well as refurbishment and maintenance work to create more prison places. The additional 10,000 prisoner places will be on top of new prisons already announced, at Wellingborough in Northamptonshire and Glen Parva in Leicestershire, which the Ministry of Justice said would provide 3,360 spaces by 2023. The announcements will boost speculation that the government is wheeling out a series of voter-friendly policies in anticipation of an autumn election prompted by divisions on Brexit, whether pushed for by Johnson or forced by a vote of no confidence in the Commons. Johnson, writing in the Mail on Sunday, said the time had arrived to \u201ccome down hard on crime\u201d. In the Sun on Sunday, Patel said she would ensure police had \u201cthe resources and the powers they need\u201d to protect people."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
