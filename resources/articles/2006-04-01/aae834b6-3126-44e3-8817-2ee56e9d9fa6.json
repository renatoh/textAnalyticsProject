The Mali midfielder is reputedly high on Sir Alex Ferguson's wish list but the French league leaders announced yesterday that any prospective purchaser would have to pay more than the sum Chelsea spent on Michael Essien last year. United's interest in Diarra is still unconfirmed but Ferguson travelled to San Siro to watch Lyon take on Milan in last week's Champions League quarter-final. The Spanish sports daily Marca has also claimed that Real Madrid were informed of United's desire to sign Diarra when they initiated their own talks with Lyon's chairman Jean-Michel Aulas. Lyon's stance is that they want to keep their best players \"even if a good deal is possible\", although they made similar noises before agreeing to sell Essien. The Glazer family might however be put off by Aulus's declaration that Diarra \"would be more expensive than Essien\". Liverpool will face competition from the Champions League semi-finalists Villarreal as well as unnamed English clubs if they revive their interest in Deportivo la Coru\u00f1a's right-winger V\u00edctor Gonz\u00e1lez at the end of the season. The 30-year-old was due to complete a move to Anfield during the January transfer window only for the move to collapse over the size of the fee. However V\u00edctor's contract at La Riazor is due to expire on June 30 and he seems certain to leave the club under the Bosman ruling. \"How can I say that I would not be interested in moving to Liverpool? That would be ridiculous,\" he said. The player's agent Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1nchez said he may be tempted by Villarreal - \"the kind of club for whom V\u00edctor would like to play\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
