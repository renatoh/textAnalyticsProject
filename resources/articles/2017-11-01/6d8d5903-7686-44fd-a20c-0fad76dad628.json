Yet despite this, Alexandre Lacazette\u2019s second half consolation highlighted a weak spot that City\u2019s competitors are sure to study. When Liverpool were trounced 5-0 in early September City had been split open along Nicolas Otamendi\u2019s left-hand channel before Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s 37th-minute sending off changed the contest. In this match a similar vulnerability came when Otamendi was given scant support by an awol Fabian Delph, the left-back, and so Lacazette could stroke beyond the excellent Ederson Moraes. City are a formidable force but the job of their fellow championship contenders is to try and pick them apart: the issue, of course, is how the blue wave can be relentless, as Gabriel Jesus\u2019s finish following Lacazette\u2019s proved. 2) Ederson impresses yet again for City The goalkeeper\u2019s excellent contribution to City\u2019s start is illustrated by the fact that he has attracted close to zero attention so far. Following Claudio Bravo\u2019s calamitous time last season, this shows how reliable the Brazilian has been. The Chilean had been recruited, in part, for his work with his feet, but that actually proved to be an achilles heel and Ederson has been the polar opposite, as was shown when he was hurried by an Arsenal press and calmly stroked the ball over to John Stones. When required to do some actual goal-minding for his side, the 24-year-old was as sharp as his outfield colleagues: for instance, when Alexis S\u00e1nchez popped Mesut \u00d6zil into a good position, out raced Ederson to collect. Better still was a save from Aaron Ramsey at the end of the first half that kept his team ahead, with the No1 also blameless regarding Arsenal\u2019s goal. 3) Delph enjoying life as a born-again full-back The 27-year-old who performed two U-turns before finally joining City from Aston Villa in summer 2015 is enjoying a run at left-back or left wing-back due to Benjamin Mendy\u2019s serious knee injury. He is the latest example of Guardiola\u2019s love of packing his teams with as many midfielders as possible. Today he was the left-back in a four, and his scheming abilities were shown when spraying one diagonal ball out from defence to initiate an attack. As is Guardiola\u2019s wont, too, he stepped forward from defence into Arsenal territory when possible to squeeze space. Mendy may not be able to return until April, meaning Delph has the prospect of a near season-long stay in the side. To do so, though, he will have to improve the awry positioning that allowed Lacazette to be one-on-one with Otamendi for his goal. Delph took a late knock but the hope is that it was not serious. 4) Arsenal\u2019s five at the back were well under par Ars\u00e8ne Wenger may have questioned Michael Oliver\u2019s refereeing and whether Raheem Sterling dived, but the truth was that his back five of Sead Kolasinac, Nacho Monreal, Francis Coquelin, Laurent Koscielny and Hector Beller\u00edn were close to calamitous. City\u2019s opener came when Kevin De Bruyne swapped passes with Fernandinho, waltzed forward as Koscielny watched space, then beat Petr Cech: no wonder Wenger looked royally cheesed off. The Frenchman adores flowing football so he cannot have been any more impressed with how, when De Bruyne pressed Coquelin into an area near a corner flag, the No34 hoofed the ball straight out. Poorer still was Monreal\u2019s concession of the second-half penalty on Sterling from which Sergio Ag\u00fcero notched goal No179 for the club. Wenger believed this should not have been awarded but it seemed the correct decision. 5) Mesut \u00d6zil would be a fine January buy The 2014 World Cup-winner would surely grace a genuine title-contending team rather than a side that perennially fails to achieve that status. \u00d6zil\u2019s contract expires next summer and as a favourite of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho when he was in charge of Real Madrid, might Manchester United\u2019s manager consider a January window bid? In the opening moments the German drifted near to Ederson\u2019s goal to be Arsenal\u2019s furthest player forward. Later, he pulled a left-foot shot wide. Yet after the 29-year-old was next put in by Alexis S\u00e1nchez he drifted away to the periphery. During four years at the north London club \u00d6zil\u2019s figures are seven goals in 40 appearances in 2013-14; five in 32 in 2014-15; eight in 44 in 2015-16; 12 in 44 last term, and, so far, only one in nine this year. Those numbers could well rise if he played in a finer team."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
