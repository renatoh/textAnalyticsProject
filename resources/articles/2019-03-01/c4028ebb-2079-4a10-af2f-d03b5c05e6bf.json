Security in the region could also be undermined, David Sterling said, adding: \u201cThe planning assumptions include the possibility that, in some scenarios, a no-deal exit could result in additional challenges for the police if the approach appeared to be unfair or unreasonable for some of those most affected.\u201d Sterling warns that EU tariffs could kill off some farming and food processing interests. \u201cIn effect, there is currently no mitigation available for the severe consequences of a no-deal outcome,\u201d the letter says. \u201cThese consequences do not arise from the possibility of checks or controls on either side of the land border, but would simply be the direct consequence of the legal position that would apply. This point is well understood by the business community.\u201d The letter points out that Northern Ireland, which is one of the weakest of the regions in the UK economically, is particularly vulnerable as 75% of all private sector employers were small- or medium-sized enterprises. Fears of a no-deal Brexit have grown as the 29 March deadline for leaving the EU approaches and MPs continue to be reluctant to back Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement. One of the sticking points is the arrangement in the prime minister\u2019s deal for a backstop to prevent the creation of a hard border on the island of Ireland. The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, and the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, held fresh talks in Brussels on Tuesday in a renewed effort to secure changes to the backstop to allay fears it could leave the UK trapped in a customs union with the EU. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, earlier said the UK was prepared to be flexible over how to address concerns about the backstop and Europe\u2019s leaders were giving \u201cpositive signals\u201d on the issue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
