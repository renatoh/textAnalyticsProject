It is the cheapest pay-as-you-go handset she could find, a model about five or six years old. Almost the only thing it does is make and answer calls. The screen is black and white and it cost \u00a330 in Tesco. My mobile has a colour screen, a Bluetooth connection, two inbuilt modems, still and video cameras and an MP3 player. It is very much clumsier as a device for texting, too. Considered purely as a device for making and receiving phone calls, it has one advantage over my daughter's: it will work almost anywhere in the world and the price charged for this very marginal rise in utility is exorbitant. The battery life is about a 10th of what my daughter gets; the phone is bulkier, and weighs twice as much and probably costs 10 times as much to run. I must take out a contract, which costs at least \u00a3250 a year. But this doesn't cover the cost of the calls I really need it for, which are made, or even received, abroad. Those cost a minimum of 90p a minute, and sometimes very much more. All of a sudden, the golf game, the colour screen, and the video camera don't look quite so free, and they've never been useful or very diverting. Looking at my daughter's phone, I felt the industry had boiled me like a frog, slowly, so that I never once noticed what had happened and jumped out of the saucepan. It has been three or four upgrades since I had a phone as simple as hers now is. Each one seemed reasonable at the time, and it's only now that I realise that I was running harder and harder just to stay in the same place. This is a model for the whole silicon economy. Since the very basic services get cheaper and cheaper, it is at the margins that the gouge must be applied. Any industry built around things with chips in them depends on marketing because the chips themselves get constantly cheaper. The only way to keep margins up is to sell something new and more ambitious every year, for about the same price as the old one, and to hope that no one notices that most of the new computing power is spent overcoming problems that the old gadgets elegantly sidestepped. There are other tricks important to the industry, like relying on batteries which will only last a couple of years, and are then so expensive and difficult to replace that you might as well buy a whole new widget; but the really successful and growing industries are those which persuade consumers that they need more and more visible cleverness every year. But the trick won't work for ever. In technology, as in art, the best work is the least conspicuous and people will happily pay for stuff that seems as simple as they imagine the world to be. That's one reason Google's share price graphed against Microsoft's looks like a mountain rising out of the sea. Microsoft seems nowadays to be selling people more complicated programs than they possess, whereas we expect Google's good ideas to simplify our lives. The question is whether the mobile phone industry has reached the toppling point where no one will pay for the increasing complication of its services. Two things make this seem possible. The first is that there's clearly a market for simple phones on pay-as-you-go contracts: people are treating them as commodities even in Europe. The really phenomenal growth is to be found outside the rich world - there are now 2bn mobile phones in use around the world - and the future is obviously with the cheap and simple ones. Even within the rich world, the phones that do everything don't do it well. If I want music on the move, I can get an iPod nano and a cheap phone for much less than a phone that plays MP3. The two together will give me better music, weigh less and take up less space than a unified widget. It's time for this frog to leap out of the saucepan. The second comes back to Google: internet telephony. Google talk is not the only internet telephony around, obviously. The market leader is Skype, which eBay has just bought for an eye-watering number of billions. But Google will do for the purposes of argument because it's so deliciously simple. All you need is two or three minutes' downloading and button clicking, and you can make calls from an internet-connected laptop to another one anywhere in the world, for free. The quality is superb. This is the speakerphone I have always wanted. As soon as I saw it working, I got accounts for the whole family. I need never again pay for a phone call home from a hotel room anywhere. Internet telephony is obviously a deadly threat to conventional telephone companies. But it won't be much fun for the mobile phone industry, whose only real advantage is that after decades of mast-building there is hardly anywhere that a simple phone won't work. Any system to compete with that will have to work as well - however, the vastly expensive 3G networks don't. If 3G phones could not fall back to traditional networks, they'd be useless. It's possible that some forms of wireless internet connection will penetrate further and faster than 3G. If that happens, the mobile market will switch. But already you can buy a service which routes all your mobile calls at cheap Skype rates. To make it work, you need a spare mobile to leave by the phone at all times - but the point of the story is that everyone nowadays has one of those. We just need to notice that they're not obsolete."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
