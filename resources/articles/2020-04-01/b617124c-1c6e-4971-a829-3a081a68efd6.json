Reuven Rivlin had said he would not extend the deadline, which expired at midnight on Monday, as it was not clear that Gantz and Netanyahu were close to signing a power-sharing agreement. But after a televised plea by Gantz to Netanyahu on Monday evening, the prime minister invited his political foe to his residence to continue negotiations, and the pair jointly requested an extension. \u201cNetanyahu, this is our moment of truth,\u201d Gantz had said in the broadcast. \u201cIsraelis are expecting us to put aside our differences and work together.\u201d The president\u2019s office said a request for a 48-hour extension arrived just before midnight on Monday \u201cwith the support of both sides and on the understanding that they are very close to reaching an agreement between them\u201d. Netanyahu and Gantz, who have fought each other in three inconclusive elections during the past year, have both expressed a desire to come to an understanding as the country faces the coronavirus pandemic. Neither man has enough seats in parliament for a majority, so have considered a power-sharing deal that would see them rotate the role of leader over a four-year term. Still, hopes for a deal remain tempered as previous rounds of talks \u2013 including all-night negotiations \u2013 have failed. Last week, Gantz\u2019s party, Blue and White, said an \u201call round agreement\u201d had already been reached but accused Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party of suddenly resurrecting old demands about judicial appointments. Likud countered that it was Gantz who backed away at the last minute. Israeli media speculated that Netanyahu might have \u201ctorpedoed\u201d the negotiations after polls showed his party could win a possible fourth election, which will be held if the stalemate continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
