Spirit-based products described and promoted as \"shooters\" or \"slammers\" are likely to fall foul of a revised code of practice published yesterday by the drinks industry body the Portman Group. But health organisations warned that the new guidelines were likely to be ineffective as the code had no statutory force, and would not apply to promotions run by pubs, bars and nightclubs. The restrictions will apply to pre-packaged alcoholic drinks from January next year and will cover a drink's name and packaging, press releases, websites, sponsorship, sampling, branded merchandise and all other promotional material. Popular promotional activities such as serving drinks from squirt guns or drinking \"countdowns\" will be banned under the new code where they have been organised by drinks manufacturers. Drinks marketed as \"shots\" will be unaffected, the Portman Group said. Products sold in single-shot containers or test tube-style packaging will still be permitted because it is up to consumers how quickly they drink them. David Poley, chief executive of the Portman Group, said the move was aimed primarily at the 18-24 age group responsible for most binge drinking and the antisocial behaviour that stemmed from it. He said: \"In the end, only drinkers can control the way they drink. Producers want to promote responsible behaviour and not a drinking style which can be harmful. \"We cannot alone change consumer behaviour. But the drinks industry can play its part and take responsibility for its own behaviour in terms of marketing and advertising.\" New guidance has been prepared so companies know whether their marketing is likely to be unacceptable to the Independent Complaints Panel, the drinks marketing complaints body. Retailers will be instructed not to sell any drink found to be in breach of the code until it has been altered to comply with it. The code also requires alcohol branding to be removed from children's replica sports shirts in sponsorship contracts signed after January next year. A spokesman for Alcohol Concern said: \"This is well-intentioned but does not go far enough. The code itself is voluntary, while the sanctions are not tough enough and the complaints system is a complicated maze.\" A spokesman for the British Beers and Pubs Association insisted its own code was effective: \"Irresponsible promotions on shooters and slammers would breach the existing code.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
