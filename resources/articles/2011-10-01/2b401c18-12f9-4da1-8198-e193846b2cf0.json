Optimism among chief financial officers of leading UK firms fell for the third quarter in a row between July and September, says the latest Deloitte CFO survey, with the outlook at its lowest level since early 2009, when the UK was in recession. Nearly half of those executives questioned \u2013 43% \u2013 believe that the UK will fall back into recession, up from 33% last quarter. In addition, confidence in the manufacturing and service sectors has declined to a two-year low, according to the latest Business Trends report by the accountants BDO. For the first time since July 2009, both the manufacturing and service sectors are showing optimism levels below the 95 mark that indicates growth. Confidence in the manufacturing sector is particularly low. Its optimism score has fallen from 116.4 to 88.2 in seven months. As European leaders prepare to meet in Brussels next week to find a solution to the euro debt crisis, the proportion of UK chief financial officers who say external financial and macroeconomic uncertainty is \"high\" or \"very high\" has almost doubled to 46%, from 26% in the previous quarter. The weaker and more uncertain backdrop has also dented corporate appetite for risk. After peaking in the first half of 2011, risk appetite has fallen at its fastest rate since the Deloitte CFO survey began in 2007. Risk appetite is lowest in the financial sector and highest in the consumer goods and technology sectors. Margaret Ewing, a senior Deloitte partner and former FTSE 100 chief financial officer (CFO), said: \"The world has become riskier and more uncertain for corporates. Most think that a period of margin expansion is drawing to an end. CFOs are responding with a renewed focus on cost control. Expectations of a revival in corporate capital spending and hiring are fading.\" Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, added: \"There is a clear distinction between UK and internationally focused corporates. Companies which derive 70% or more of their revenues from outside the UK still see expansion as their top priority. Nonetheless, even among this group defensive strategies such as reducing costs and increasing cashflow have gained importance.\" Businesses' pessimism is also compounded by the BDO output index, which measures UK businesses' short-run turnover expectations. This fell to 93.3 in September, again its lowest level since the summer of 2009. There is little sign of a reversal of this trend, as hiring intentions in the manufacturing and services sectors indicate further headcount reductions ahead. The overall growth prospects for the UK labour market are equally bleak \u2013 the BDO employment index fell for the fourth consecutive month in September, and official data for the three months to July show the largest quarterly rise in unemployment since August 2009. Peter Hemington, a partner at BDO, said: \"Businesses' hiring intentions point to more job losses ahead which, coupled with tumbling optimism and output, indicates tough times in early 2012. Given that the latest ONS [Office for National Statistics] growth figures have been revised downwards, this concern is even more acute. \"To reinvigorate the UK economy we urge the government to invest in business by implementing supply-side reforms \u2013 particularly reform of the tax system \u2013 and to introduce measures that encourage private-sector investment in infrastructure. \"We have been calling for expansionist policy from the Bank of England for some time and are pleased that the government has pledged to inject a further \u00a375bn into the economy. Given the data we're seeing, this will provide a much needed and timely boost. In addition, we welcome the chancellor's proposed credit-easing scheme; however, given that any effects are not likely to be felt until 2013, the more immediate measures to salvage the UK's ailing economy are imperative.\" Meanwhile, in its report published today, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development questions whether the government's stance on public-sector job cuts is tenable. It argues that the chancellor should in next month's autumn statement announce a temporary halt to further cuts as part of any broader plan to stimulate economic growth and combat rising unemployment. The government contends that its programme of public-sector job cuts is modest and manageable, relative to the overall level of public-sector employment and given that the vast bulk of job losses will not occur until late in the current parliament. As a result, ministers do not expect public-sector austerity to add to unemployment, which would make it more difficult for the government to meet its fiscal deficit-reduction timetable. The CIPD Work Audit report shows that the public sector shed almost 250,000 jobs in the government's first year of office, with public-sector job losses in the first quarter of the current financial year already five times greater than projected by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) for the entire year. Taking figures on actual public-sector job losses together with the existing OBR projection, this implies a total loss of more than 600,000 public-sector jobs between 2010-11 and 2015-16 \u2013 a third more than ministers say they expect. John Philpott, chief economic adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said: \"With the economy and labour market in such a fragile condition, it is worrying that public-sector job losses are turning out to be much greater than ministers have previously been suggesting. Public-sector job cuts in this context are a false economy, adding to unemployment and in turn hindering rather than helping the task of fiscal deficit reduction. A more sensible course would be to delay public-sector job cuts to the end of this parliament and if necessary into the next, thereby enabling them to be absorbed more easily without nasty macroeconomic side-effects. The government's plan for growth must rightly contain measures to stimulate private sector job creation but the chancellor should also avoid the own goal of cutting public-sector jobs at a time of high and rising unemployment.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
