The winter of 2010-2011 may live in memory as cold and snowy but it was only really December 2010 and early January 2011 that were harsh, with most of the season's snow falling before Christmas. Through January and February temperatures steadily rose; frosts were less frequent than usual and there was little more snowfall, and short-lived when it occurred. The spring had some exceptionally warm periods, as did autumn, with those seasons sandwiching a relatively cool summer. Temperatures Despite the summer, 2011 ranks as the second warmest year in a record stretching back 353 years, with a Central England Temperature (CET) of just over 10.7C; only 2006 was warmer. January, June, July and August each had a CET below normal but every other month was above average, some considerably so. April was the warmest on record, and November the second warmest behind 1994. February was the warmest for nine years, and October and December both the mildest since 2006. The summer months, however, were the coolest since 1993. The nation's highest maximum temperature was the 33.1C recorded at Swanscombe in Kent on 27th June, and the lowest was \u201313.0C at Altnaharra, Sutherland, on 8th January. Unusually, some locations in southern England had their highest temperature for the year in early October. Rainfall Although 2011 was 10% wetter than average it was Scotland and north-west England that bore the brunt of the precipitation, with many months having excess rainfall. This is in marked contrast to central, southern and eastern England where there was often a notable deficit. The east of England and the Midlands were badly affected by drought, but particularly Shropshire and Herefordshire. Spring across England and Wales was the driest since 1893. Sunshine The eastern half of England had a very sunny year with sunshine hours well above average; elsewhere they were just above normal, and as a whole the UK was a little less sunny than the previous two years. February had the least sunshine since 1980, and August was unusually cloudy as well but April was the sunniest since the arid April of 1893."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
