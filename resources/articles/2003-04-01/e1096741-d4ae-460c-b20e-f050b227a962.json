Nothing and everything. In this beautifully conceived and composed novel, Glenn Patterson articulates the poetry of the ordinary. One humdrum 1950s house in Belfast replicates its fellows in a new estate. To this house, five families come and go in four and a half decades, each greeted by the sole constants of the area, Artie the estate agent and Ivy, who bears a drum of salt across the road to welcome each new neighbour. First in are the Falloons, Stella and Harry, a couple eager to nestbuild. Stella is impressed by the newfangled convector and the bathroom heater Harry brings home: \"But remember it's electric, so use it sparingly.\" Embarking upon the disappointing adventure of married life, Stella, forbidden to go out to work, is confined to the street and its dramas of tedium. When crisis strikes and the Falloons leave, enter the McGoverns, leaving the disputatious Rodney's map of the world, which he fabricates from \"a slight discolouration on the plaster\", while redecorating the baby's room. Each set of dwellers leaves a cryptic trace. The Tans, a Chinese family welcomed by a paper plate of shit through the letterbox, are succeeded by the Eliots, who, one by one, \"get God\"; finally, unmarried partners uneasily cohabit a house which, by the millennium, has exchanged its architecture and d\u00e9cor for 90s minimalism: chrome clothes rail, futon, yucca. Although the novel covers the period of The Troubles, one of its many strengths is fidelity to the quotidian, for most of what hap pens in Number 5 might happen in any family house anywhere. And yet every sentence is revelatory, a fusion of artistic tact with exactitude of observation and human tenderness. Graham is glimpsed at his father's death silently sobbing \"in his donkey jacket and bobble hat ... into the heels of his hands\"; toddler Penny rushes from her mother in dismay, \"tights only half pulled up\". With understated humour and pathos, Patterson refuses the allure of the sensational. Other residents are spied through the blinds of Number 5, carried out in coffins, up to something (but who knows what?), heard at New Year's Eve parties. When a family has vacated the house, it disappears, and there is no conjuring of the uncanny or the Gothic. Number 5 is a space for the lives and voices who replace one another: and yet, with artistry of the highest order, Patterson's serial use of the first person convinces us of each individual's uniqueness and of the extent to which each family is shaped by the fashions and agendas of its period. Patterson partially appeases the curiosity he has aroused, in the revelations of the final section, when Penny, child of the first owners, returns, and the grotesque events of the Falloons' departure are explained. This is perhaps the weakest part of the novel. Disappearances are more thought-provoking. Nevertheless, the romance of the banal never deserts the narrative. Humour and the oblique view of large events from the marginal interior space that most of us inhabit give Patterson's novel a rare authenticity. I wanted it to be longer and am left brooding wistfully, its characters lingering: the little people like ourselves, who fill the horizon of daily experience.
