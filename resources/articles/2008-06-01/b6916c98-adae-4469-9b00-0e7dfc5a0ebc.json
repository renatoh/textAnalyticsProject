Sporadic and impulsive. Do you make purchases you then regret? Not normally, but I recently bought a ridiculous pregnancy blouse that I haven't touched since. But you enjoy shopping? A lot. I'm sorry, I don't care what they say. It makes you feel good. What's the secret of a successful shopping trip? Don't have high expectations. If you go out looking for something you'll never find it. What was your earliest shopping memory? Getting lost in Woolworths in Cape Town because my mum was so absorbed by it. She's originally from there. Their Woolworths is completely different. They have an incredible denim range. Do you go shopping with your sister, Sienna? We don't really get the chance as we're both so busy. Occasionally we make it to Matches or Harvey Nichols. What's the last thing you bought? Silly putty for my kids. They're obsessed with it. And the next thing? Washable nappies. Totnesnappycompany.co.uk tailor-makes nappy packages. Where do you shop in Gloucestershire? There is a great antique centre on the A419 just before you hit Stroud, and I love Green Spirit in Nailsworth for its delicious organic beauty products. What can't you get through the week without? Chopped pineapple - it must be some weird pregnancy thing, as I hated it before. \u00b7 Savannah Miller is supporting the Girls!
