Australian industries exposed if China trade tensions persist", "bodyText": "China\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on Australian barley imports has highlighted how reliant some sectors are on Chinese demand, with wool producers now \u201cparticularly exposed\u201d by the threat of a further escalation in trade tensions. After the effective barley tariff of more than 80% was confirmed on Monday night, the agriculture minister, David Littleproud, declared \u201cthere is no trade war\u201d with China, denying that the tariff \u2013 officially cited by China as a penalty for dumping \u2013 was linked to Australia\u2019s push for an inquiry into the origins and handling of Covid-19 that had secured widespread international support hours earlier. However, China experts predict more action from Beijing is likely, and warn that news of the barley tariff will send a message inside China that Australia is not a \u201cfriendly\u201d or reliable country to import from and could impact the decision to buy Australian goods across several industries. An earlier ban China introduced on the importation of beef from four Australian abattoirs over alleged compliance issues is expected to affect about 35% of the projected $3.5bn worth of beef exports to China this year. With the effective halt to the $600m of annual barley exports to the country, agricultural bodies are paying close attention to the wool industry\u2019s roughly 75% export reliance on Chinese demand. Australia\u2019s four largest exports to China \u2013 $63bn in iron ore, $16bn in natural gas, $14bn in coal and $12bn spent by international students studying in Australia \u2013 are not expected to be affected in the short term due to their size and the Chinese market\u2019s reliance. According to the Department of Agriculture, Australian producers exported about $3.16bn in unprocessed or \u201cgreasy\u201d wool to China in 2018-19, which represents an even larger value and industry reliance on China than barley. Wool exports have already suffered from a drop to a five-year low in sale prices because of a halt in demand outside of China during the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 allowing Chinese buyers greater ability to dictate the prices they pay. The president of Wool Producers Australia, Ed Storey, is confident a strong relationship with Chinese importers and recent investment in processing capability will stop the industry being targeted by Chinese trade restrictions. But Rural Bank\u2019s chief operating officer, Will Rayner, told the Guardian the wool and barley industries were similar in their vulnerability to Chinese tariffs. Rayner said that because China purchased more raw wool than the rest of the world combined, any tariffs \u201cwould have an immediate effect on Australian wool exports\u201d. \u201cThis would continue until tariffs were removed or a new market was found. While all Australian agricultural commodities rely to some extent on Chinese demand, the barley and wool markets are particularly exposed. \u201cWhile prices would rise domestically in China if Australian wool was removed from the market [as with barley], the impact would be far more significant to Australian producers than Chinese consumers,\u201d Rayner said. Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute, said \u201cthere\u2019s little chance\u201d of Australia\u2019s relationship with China getting substantially better in the near future. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that the relationship has turned for the worst ... Australia has actually said businesses should diversify, and the Chinese will too.\u201d McGregor said that in light of the barley tariff and rising tensions, wholesalers and importers inside China \u201cwill now think there\u2019s a risk of importing from Australia\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019d have to expect that the importers would take the message onboard that Australia isn\u2019t a friendly country,\u201d he said, suggesting Chinese industries would begin diversifying their reliance on Australian goods. \u201cBoth sides have made it clear that that\u2019s what they should do.\u201d While Australia has indicated it might take up the barley tariff decision with the World Trade Organisation, McGregor said trade restrictions would not \u201cstop overnight\u201d and \u201ccould get worse\u201d. He noted a potential intensifying of Australia China tensions that could arise from the South China Sea dispute and other areas of friction. \u201cThere\u2019s wool, there\u2019s iron ore, education, tourism. China can interfere with them all,\u201d he said, noting that imports related to construction, like iron ore, were less likely to be targeted. Weihuan Zhou, a senior lecturer at the University of New South Wales\u2019 China International Business and Economic Law Centre, told the Guardian that further Chinese tariff and trade restriction decisions would likely prioritise ensuring local producers could still source the products they needed, but that \u201cagriculture would be an obvious option\u201d to explore. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to tell which industry will be targeted next,\u201d Zhou said, noting wine, wool and dairy exports could all be targeted. \u201cIt depends on whether the bilateral relations will continue to sour. I\u2019m not quite sure how much impact Australia\u2019s view on Covid could continue to strain the relationship from here.\u201d Zhou also said that while the Chinese government could theoretically attempt to disincentive students from going to study in Australian universities, such a move was unlikely in the short term as it would \u201crequire a very obvious and significant government intervention\u201d that would frustrate citizens and have \u201ca serious impact on China\u2019s reputation\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
