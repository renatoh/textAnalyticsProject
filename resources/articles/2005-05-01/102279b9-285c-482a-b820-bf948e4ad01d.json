West Wing fans were aghast when creator Aaron Sorkin threw in the towel, but John Wells has made an admirable replacement, taking the show into darker territory and addressing the problems of American foreign policy. \u00b7 Warner, \u00a359.99 The Big Lebowski Festival One of the more frenzied entries into the world of fandom is the cult of The Big Lebowki. Across America there are people dressing up as the Dude, Jesus and the Nihilists, ordering White Russians, and heading down to the nearest bowling alley to re-create scenes from the Coen brothers' comedy classic. Now it's happening in the UK ... in London ... tonight ... \u00b7 Streatham Superbowl, London SW2, bookings on dudeabides.co.uk Soul Deep This exhaustive six-part series covers the history of the coolest music of all time, from its roots in the churches of 50s black America to the ghetto-fabulous sounds of Outkast and Beyonc\u00e9. First up is a profile of Ray Charles, the first man of soul, and also featured are Louis Jordan, Ruth Brown, Fats Domino and Jerry Wexler's Atlantic Records. Episodes on Motown, southern soul and 70s funk follow in the coming weeks; all are essential viewing. \u00b7 8.25pm, tomorrow, BBC2 Balalaikas in Blackpool Unlikely as it may seem, the Soviets set their sights on Blackpool as the ideal location for a late-60s communist invasion of Britain. This was only revealed decades later, when the collapse of the Soviet Union released secret documents that recommended specific bed and breakfasts as ideal resting places for invading Red Army soldiers. Presenter Henry Dodds talks to former Soviets about the re-education of north England's hedonistic resort town. \u00b7 8pm, Monday, Radio 4 Donovan's albums reissued It's taken 40 years, but Donovan is finally being accepted as something more than Britain's less brilliant answer to Bob Dylan. Donovan was still a teenager in 1965 when he made his Dylanesque debut single Catch the Wind, but found his own voice with a handful of timeless psychedelic songs, Season of the Witch and The Hurdy Gurdy Man among them. His whimsy is captured on Summer Day Reflection Songs; the other, later albums get groovy. \u00b7 Out on EMI on Monday Lyric Nights In the spirit of an old-fashioned music hall revue, the Lyric Theatre in London has collected a diverse group of musicians and performers for a season of music and storytelling. One night features 70s singer-songwriter Linda Thompson alongside rising star Martha Wainwright; later on there is the king of Iraq's jazz scene, Ilham al-Madfai. But the highlight must be a rare show by Jimmy Webb, the man behind Wichita Lineman and By The Time I Get to Phoenix. \u00b7 From Thursday, Lyric Hammersmith, London W6 The Magic Numbers on tour When we raved about these sturdy siblings last year they were winning over audiences in tiny dives with their catchy, 60s-inflected harmonies. Now they are headlining 1,000-capacity halls \u2014 and still only released one single. This could be the perfect time to see them before the attention goes to their heads. \u00b7 Brighton Concorde 2, Wednesday 11; London Forum, Thursday 12; then touring Witchfinders: A Seventeenth-Century English Tragedy by Malcolm Gaskill At the height of the English civil war, an uptight 22-year-old called Matthew Hopkins took it upon himself to rid East Anglia of the curse of witchcraft. He sought women to torture, accusing them of feeding blood to animal familiars and having sex with the devil. With no official sanction, Hopkins tortured at least 250 women and \"sentenced\" over 100 to death. This is Hopkins' story, which forms a lucid companion piece to the classic horror movie Witchfinder General. \u00b7 John Murray, \u00a320"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
