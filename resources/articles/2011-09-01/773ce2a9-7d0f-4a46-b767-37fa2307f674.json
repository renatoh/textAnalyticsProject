Its report on the initiative, which was aimed at replacing the control rooms of 46 local services with a network of nine regional centres and a national computer system, says it was one of the worst cases of project failure the committee has seen in many years. Only the London regional control centre is being used, and the project has cost the taxpayer at least \u00a3469m. FiReControl was launched in 2004 under the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister but has more recently been under Communities and Local Government (CLG). The PAC report follows the announcement in December 2010 that the project was to be axed, with none of the original objectives achieved, and similarly sharp criticisms by the National Audit Office in July. It says the project was flawed from the outset, as the department did not have the powers to impose a single, national approach on locally accountable fire and rescue services that were reluctant to change the way they operated. It excluded them from decisions about the design of the regional centres and the proposed IT solution, even though they would incur long term costs and residual liabilities to which they had not agreed. Among the other criticisms are that the department: \u2022 Launched the project too quickly, did not apply basic project approval checks and balances and made unrealistic forecasts on costs and savings. \u2022 Did not apply the fundamentals of project management. \u2022 Had too high a turnover of senior managers, none of whom have been accountable. \u2022 Awarded the IT contract to a company, Cassidian, with no direct experience of supplying emergency services and was over-reliant on sub-contractors. \u2022 And designed and managed the contract badly. The department has now earmarked \u00a384.8m to meet its original objectives, inviting bids for the money from each of the fire services. The report says it is not clear whether this will provide value for money, or how CLG will ensure there is a sufficient response in the event of a large scale incident. Margaret Hodge, chair of the PAC, said: \"The project was rushed, without proper understanding of costs or risks. The leadership relied far too much on external consultants and the frequent departures of senior staff also contributed to weak management and oversight of the project. \"The contract to implement a national IT system linking the control centres was not even awarded until a full three years after the project started. The contract itself was poorly designed and awarded to a company without relevant experience. The computer system was simply never delivered. \"No one has been held to account for this project failure, one of the worst we have seen for many years, and the careers of most of the senior staff responsible have carried on as if nothing had gone wrong at all and the consultants and contractor continue to work on many other government projects.\" The Conservative Party issued a statement identifying FiReControl's failures with the previous Labour administration. Fire minister Bob Neill said: \"John Prescott's FiReControl project is the latest in Labour's catalogue of costly IT failures. Not for the first time, hard working taxpayers are paying for Labour's inability to manage risks and control costs. \"I welcome this report which exposes the absence of basic project management and leadership for a major undertaking. Labour must be held accountable for this comprehensive failure.\" This article is published by Guardian Professional.
