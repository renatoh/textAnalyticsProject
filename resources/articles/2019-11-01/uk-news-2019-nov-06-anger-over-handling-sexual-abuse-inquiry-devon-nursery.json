Police have spoken to more than 100 families whose children attended Jack and Jill Childcare in Torquay and it is understood up to a dozen children may be potential victims. Parents are questioning why the nursery remained open between July, when the allegations were made, and the end of October, when Ofsted suspended its licence, compelling it to close. One father said he learned by text message that the nursery was closing and felt let down and angry. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult thing to talk about. When it first happened we didn\u2019t know a lot about what had gone on. Then we heard through a text message last month that the nursery was going to be shut. We were drip-fed stuff from Ofsted. \u201cIt\u2019s only a small nursery. I believe the [person arrested] had contact with my child. As far as I\u2019m aware there\u2019s been no damage done. \u201cMy son now goes to a different nursery. If they get their licence back he will never go back there. We weren\u2019t told the nature of it all, how bad it was. We were left in the dark. \u201cMy boy has been there since he was a baby. We had a long relationship with Jack and Jill. I feel very angry towards them. I feel they failed my boy. He\u2019s lost friendships with other children and key workers. A lot of the staff are very good. It\u2019s a shame.\u201d Devon and Cornwall police said that on 29 July they received information relating to allegations of sexual assault at the nursery and launched Operation Lofting. A male worker in his teens was arrested that day on suspicion of sexual offences and is on police bail. He has moved out of the Devon and Cornwall police force area while the investigation takes place. Another young mother, whose two young children attended the nursery, said the allegations had led to anger and distress in the neighbourhood. \u201cSome parents are obviously really, really angry,\u201d she said. \u201cI have seen one of the owners and they are devastated. She fell apart when I saw her, she was a mess and crying.\u201d A staff member at the nursery, who declined to give his name, said: \u201cI have no idea what\u2019s going on at the moment. We don\u2019t know why now Ofsted have chosen to shut us down. They\u2019ve been in, the police have been in, everyone has been in. This place has been like a flying circus of people. I\u2019ve never known anything like it.\u201d Police said the investigation was taking time because it was highly sensitive. Officers have viewed more than 250 hours of CCTV footage. They do not believe the offences include the taking or distributing of images. They referred questions about why the nursery had remained open on to Ofsted. A notice from Ofsted on the door of the nursery said its registration had been suspended \u201cto allow time to investigate our belief that a child may be exposed to a risk of harm\u201d, adding: \u201cWe will regularly review the situation and will stop the suspension within this period if we believe children are no longer at risk.\u201d After an inspection in 2016, Ofsted concluded: \u201cStaff have a good understanding of safeguarding. The management team ensures they are clear about what they need to do if they have any concerns about a child\u2019s welfare. It regularly checks staff suitability and reviews the quality of their practice. Safeguarding is effective.\u201d Ofsted declined to explain why the nursery had remained open over the summer. It is likely that its inquiry will look into how nursery managers monitored staff. In a statement, Ofsted said: \u201cJack and Jill Childcare is suspended. All parents of children who attend the provider have been informed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
