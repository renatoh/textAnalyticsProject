Such disenchantment comes, it should be added, from hearing it in quantity. Performed in isolation, her works often give the impression of stark originality. However, placed end to end in this year's BBC composer weekend, they revealed startling limitations of emotional range. Deeply religious, Gubaidulina has been likened to Dostoevsky in her ability to illuminate extremes of despair and elation, though such states also seemingly constitute her sole mode of perception and expression. The overall effect is wearing: you feel you've been in contact with sermonising rant rather than visionary spirituality. Within such a context, however, Gubaidulina's stylistic range remains considerable. She is often at her most striking when she avoids grand, convulsive orchestral gestures in favour of small, intimate groupings. Her Third String Quartet, performed by the Royal Quartet, is a parable of creation, both artistic and divine, in which inchoate pizzicatos gradually give way to surging lyricism. Introitus, for piano and chamber ensemble, beautifully played by Nicholas Hodges with Mikhail Agrest conducting the Guildhall Symphony Orchestra, builds inexorably in anticipation of some spiritual revelation that remains tantalisingly withheld. Most of the performances were exemplary, despite Valery Gergiev's late withdrawal from the proceedings. Agrest took his place in the closing BBC Symphony Orchestra concert, which juxtaposed the lavish choral panoplies of Alleluia with the dire accordion concerto Under the Sign of Scorpio, Gubaidulina's weakest score to date. The conducting honours with the LSO, meanwhile, were shared by Michail Jurowski (father of Vladimir) and Michael Francis, the former steering us through the violin concerto Offertorium with great passion, the latter doing incredible things with the vast, forbidding architecture of Pro et Contra."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
