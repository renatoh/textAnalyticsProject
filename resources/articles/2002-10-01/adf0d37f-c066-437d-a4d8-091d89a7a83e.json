Following yesterday's fairly tepid stuff about her affair with Sven-Goran Eriksson, Ulrika's paymasters promise more interesting revelations in future instalments, concerning the boudoir activities of other \"major figures from the world of soccer\", but we can all breathe a sigh of relief that Motty will not be among them. We know this because that little involuntary Motty laugh, which has become such a trademark of his work, came as Sven picked his way to the bench before kick-off in Bratislava. \"The England manager, who has - heh, heh - got quite a lot on his mind,\" quipped Motty. Normally Motty reserves his nervous laugh for when he has spotted some amusing football-based coincidence that he is not convinced his audience will find as uproarious as he does, like the fact that the linesman shares his middle name with the Rotherham midfielder who scored the winning goal in a Second Division match on this very day just 12 years ago. The fact that he can be so light-hearted about Sven's current problems surely indicates that Ulrika and Motty, despite what must have been great temptation, never went beyond the bounds of propriety. There will be quibblers among you who will dispute my assessment of Motson as a \"major figure from the world of soccer\", but Motty himself, despite not being one for self-aggrandisement, would wear the mantle lightly. Indeed, we have his own word for his key role in the England set-up. Quizzed on Football Focus by Ray Stubbs about Sven's state of mind on the eve of serialisation of what henceforth shall be known simply as The Book, Motty said the manager was calm and added that \"he is the tenth England manager I've worked with\". So there we have it. Managers may come and managers may go, but Motty remains. The \u00e9minence grise behind our national team. No wonder we have won nothing since 1966. Instead of fixing on a game plan, our master tactician is busy with his coloured pencils, noting down interesting facts about the little Slovakian No8's in- laws. As it turned out, on the day, tactics were of less interest than The Book. I realise, by the way, that to those of you who do not count football as your religion, but religion as your religion, The Book means something entirely different; but as we waited to discover Ulrika's revelations, the sense of fevered anticipation - ridiculously - seemed to support the view that the former weather girl was about to impart something momentous. The reaction brought to mind not so much the Children of Israel waiting for the tablets from Mount Sinai, as Moses's famous punchline: \"Good news and bad news. I've got Him down to 10, but adultery's still in.\" The Book was clearly on Gary Lineker's mind from the start of Match of the Day. \"As one chapter closes, another begins, but what will it contain?\" was his opening gambit, ostensibly referring to the end of the World Cup, and the start of the Euro 2004 campaign, but we knew what he was really talking about. \"Now let's hear from Sven's blond bombshell - David Beckham,\" he said later. And so it continued. Other references to The Book were less veiled. While some reporters pussyfooted around asking Sven whether \"off the field\" matters had affected his build-up to the England match, Garth Crooks hit him right between the eyes with his first question: \"Has speculation about the contents of Ulrika Jonsson's book made your job more difficult?\" asked our hero, actually naming Ulrika. This was something many of the press pack studiously avoided, and you could tell Sven was taking this inquisitor especially seriously, picking his words with extra care. You knew that, because he was taking almost as long over his answers as Garth was taking over his questions. Incidentally, while I was waiting for a verb to appear in one of Garth's sentences, I was struck by the thought that, given Ulrika's background in meteorology, it would have been a delicious irony had Sven ever rung her up to ask if the coast was clear. This question was not addressed in Garth's interview. I did notice, however, that Garth has begun to rap some of his questions. This kind of thing can only brighten the occasionally grey face of soccer. \"The European Championships has some very good sides in it,\" he said to Sven, then a gap of three beats, before, \"Can England win it?\" Yo! as I believe the expression goes. matin@kelner.demon.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
