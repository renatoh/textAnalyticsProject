With the summer nesting season barely two weeks old, staff from the Loggerhead MarineLife Center in Juno Beach have already found and marked 76 nests of the world\u2019s largest species of sea turtle on the nine and half mile stretch they monitor, a \u201csignificant\u201d increase from the same stage last year. The elevated numbers are raising hopes of a bumper nesting season for leatherbacks, and also vulnerable loggerhead turtles that begin to arrive to lay eggs before the end of May. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to see our turtles thrive in this environment,\u201d Sarah Hirsch, the center\u2019s senior manager of research and data, told West Palm Beach news channel 12. \u201cOur world has changed, but these turtles have been doing this for millions of years and it\u2019s just reassuring and gives us hope that the world is still going on.\u201d According to David Godfrey, the executive director of the Sea Turtle Conservancy, the coronavirus lockdown is advantageous to turtles in several ways. \u201cThe chances that turtles are going to be inadvertently struck and killed will be lower,\u201d he said in an email to the station. \u201cAll of the reduced human presence on the beach also means that there will be less garbage and other plastics entering the marine environment. \u201cIngestion and entanglement in plastic and marine debris also are leading causes of injury to sea turtles.\u201d The Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission (FWC) recorded almost 400,000 sea turtle nests along 845 miles of the state\u2019s coastline during the 2019 nesting season, which ended on 31 October. Only about one in every 1,000 hatchlings survives, MarineLife center research shows, with fatalities higher on popular tourist beaches where the chance of nest disruption is higher. \u201cWe expect that thousands of hatchlings that ordinarily would be disoriented by lights this nesting season will not be, and are more likely to survive to reach the sea,\u201d Godfrey said. Though Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, has reopened some of the state\u2019s beaches in recent days despite increasing numbers of coronavirus cases, the state\u2019s stay-at-home restrictions in other areas are benefiting other marine species as well as turtles, the FWC says. Preliminary data for the year so far indicates that manatee mortalities caused by watercraft strikes are down 9% on the previous year\u2019s average."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
