First, Sony's UK head of sales Kevin Jowett has resigned. Apparently, he's off to persue other interests outside of the industry - but you have to wonder if those 'other interests' could have waited five weeks - perhaps til after the company's key European launch. MCV has quoted a shocked retailer: \"The timing is absolutely incredible. Kevin is going just as Sony is talking to everyone about terms and arranging pre-orders and in-store marketing campaigns.\" More juicy perhaps, is the comment made on a blog named FreeRepublic.com, by EA employee Dr. Andrew Garrett: \"My opinion - get the 360 and/or the Wii. Skip the PS3 unless there's a big change in the near future.\" You can read his full post here. Naturally, anti-Sony zealots are spinning this as 'EA says skip PS3', which means Dr Garrett is probably in a whole heap of trouble. That's the problem with the modern videogame industry and the web - the two are utterly incompatible... Blog culture is all about uncensored exposition, about the personal over the corporate. The videogame industry is obsessively secretive. It is almost impossible to get a developer to talk to you about games these days - unless they're pushing their own of course. And even then both your questions and their answers have to be vetted by the publisher's PR department. Information is controlled, opinion, where possible, is obliterated. It is possibly the same in all industries. Thing is, the people who make games, are often - no, almost always - active online citizens. They're on forums and tech sites, they're opinionated, they share information. But publishers certainly don't want them to be. This clash of cultures might not be quite as profound as the one between musicians and record labels, but it is there. It is important. Strange stories then. They mean nothing, really. Just personal little events caught in the pre-launch crossfire of rumour and insidious speculation. Two blokes, going about their lives... suddenly fodder for the anti-PlayStation generation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
