Lawyers for Lynch will start their fight in London\u2019s high court against a civil case brought by HP\u2019s successor companies, who allege he fraudulently inflated the value of the Cambridge-based software firm Autonomy before an \u00a38bn takeover by Hewlett-Packard in 2011. The allegations of \u201cserious accounting improprieties\u201d were first made in November 2012, when Meg Whitman, the former eBay chief and one-time candidate for governor of California, was the chief executive of HP. Separately, Lynch faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if found guilty of the criminal charges in the US. The 17 charges include conspiracy and wire fraud. The US justice department is seeking to confiscate $804m (\u00a3608m) from Lynch which it says was obtained through fraud, with a trial expected next year. In a new US indictment, filed in a San Francisco court at the end of last week, it is alleged that Lynch and Stephen Chamberlain, a former Autonomy executive, conspired to cover up fraud, including by destroying documents, \u201cpaying hush money\u201d to former Autonomy employees and laundering the proceeds of the deal with HP. Lynch strongly denied all of the allegations. A spokesperson said: \u201cThese are baseless, egregious charges issued on the eve of the trial in the UK, where this case belongs, and Dr Lynch denies them vigorously.\u201d In a separate statement, Lynch\u2019s lawyers, Chris Morvillo of Clifford Chance and Reid Weingarten of Steptoe &amp; Johnson, said US prosecutors had shown a \u201cwild west, \u2018shoot first, ask questions later\u2019 approach to investigations\u201d. They said the allegations of hush money referred to the legal employment of former Autonomy colleagues by Lynch. The criminal and civil cases will be closely followed in UK technology circles. Until the US charges were announced in November, Lynch was a director of Darktrace, a fast-growing cybersecurity company. He remains a director of Luminance Technologies, a company using artificial intelligence to analyse legal documents, and Invoke Capital, a tech-focused investment company."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
