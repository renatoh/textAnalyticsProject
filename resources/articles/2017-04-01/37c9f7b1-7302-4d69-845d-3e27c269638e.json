The Runnymede Trust\u2019s poll of more than 1,000 black and minority ethnic teachers found that they were most likely to be told to organise school events such as Black History Month, or tasked with behaviour responsibilities rather than being given more challenging teaching or leadership roles. The survey\u2019s authors said that black teachers in particular feared being labelled troublemakers or being viewed as \u201caggressive\u201d if they challenged any decisions. Zubaida Haque, a research associate at the Runnymede Trust, said: \u201cOur survey found that BME teachers were not only overwhelmed with the mountain of paperwork but they are also beaten down by the everyday \u2018microaggressions\u2019 in the staff room and the low expectations and support by senior staff in their schools. \u201cThis has led to BME teachers feeling undervalued, isolated and disillusioned with their careers. If BME and white pupils see BME teachers being treated unequally, this sends out unacceptable signals to the next generation. For this reason, both schools and the government must do everything in their power to tackle the barriers faced by BME teachers in schools.\u201d The survey was conducted for the National Union of Teachers annual conference, which starts on Friday in Cardiff. The survey\u2019s authors concluded that \u201cinstitutional racism \u2013 often manifested in subtle and covert \u2018microaggressions\u2019 by senior staff \u2013 still plays a key part in the barriers to career progression for black teachers in many British primary and secondary schools\u201d. While Asian teachers reported \u201ccasual stereotypes\u201d and Islamophobia from both staff and students, the authors said \u201cit does suggest that the experience of racism is particularly insidious and persistent for black teachers in this study\u201d. In interviews conducted alongside the survey, teachers said that racist comments and attitudes from students were often not dealt with, although others reported a zero tolerance to racism from senior leadership. Many of the teachers questioned were positive about their treatment, although those working at schools with few other black or minority ethnic staff reported the highest levels of dissatisfaction. Several teachers said that the government\u2019s Prevent strategy, aimed at tackling extremism in schools, placed an additional burden on Asian and Muslim teachers. One black British secondary school teacher told the researchers: \u201cStudents feel they can be blatantly racist, and there are no consequences for them. These extremist views are not covered in the Prevent agenda because they are not seen as extremism.\u201d Some 60% of those surveyed reported that they were considering leaving the profession altogether, while more than half said their school was not a welcoming environment for BME children. Kevin Courtney, the NUT\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cThis report shows us the cost of the gap between the proportion of BME teachers and BME pupils, which is getting wider because diversity in teaching is not keeping pace with pupil demographics. Alongside a proper strategy to recruit and retain enough teachers, the government needs a credible strategy for attracting sufficient BME teachers.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
