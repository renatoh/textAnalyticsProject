As part of Boris Johnson\u2019s deal to avoid a border on the island of Ireland, businesses in Northern Ireland face checks and controls on all goods coming from the rest of the UK from January and are threatened with some checks going in the other direction. Business leaders have warned some firms could collapse under the weight of the costs, which will not be incurred by their counterparts in Scotland, Wales or England. A report by the Northern Ireland affairs select committee recommends that the government \u201creimburses business for any new costs incurred\u201d and clarifies urgently what new administrative requirements traders face. \u201cWe are clear that UK businesses trading across the Irish Sea must not face new upfront or ongoing costs, as these would not be compatible with the government\u2019s commitment to unfettered access and to maintaining Northern Ireland\u2019s integral place in the UK internal market,\u201d it adds. The government has said it will unveil what new controls will be mandatory in the coming weeks, but a recently leaked HM Revenue and Customs presentation to Northern Ireland businesses showed at least three layers of red tape would be imposed from January. The report also criticises the government for putting politics above business and local needs. It says: \u201cWe remain to be convinced that the government fully understands that its political approach, apparently informed by limited understanding of how business works, provides neither the clarity nor the detail that Northern Ireland business requires.\u201d Aodh\u00e1n Connolly, the head of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium who is among those campaigning for mitigation and derogations, criticised the government\u2019s new Brexit campaign slogan \u201cLet\u2019s Get Going\u201d as meaningless. Shadow Northern Ireland secretary Louise Haigh called for an urgent publication of the detailed processes that will apply to business in January. \u201cThe government\u2019s careless approach risks a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 for Northern Ireland with businesses unprepared for major new requirements with their largest trading partner, at a time when they are fighting to stay afloat during the Covid-19 crisis,\u201d she said. The select committee report also called for the work of the Brexit joint committee, chaired by Michael Gove and the European commission vice-president, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, to be made available to parliament for public scrutiny. It is charged with implementing the withdrawal agreement but its meetings are held in secret and minutes are not published. The Northern Ireland affairs committee says mechanisms \u201cmust be established\u201d to enable businesses in the region to engage with it and another specialised committee that feeds into it in order for it to be a \u201cconstructive forum for genuine problem solving\u201d. It also questions some of the pronouncements made by the government, including the declaration that \u201cexit summary declarations\u201d that the EU requires on all goods leaving the bloc for a third country will be waived. The committee calls on the government to explain how ministers will guarantee that if they cannot get agreement from the EU. It says businesses need clear operational detail to be published by October 2020."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
