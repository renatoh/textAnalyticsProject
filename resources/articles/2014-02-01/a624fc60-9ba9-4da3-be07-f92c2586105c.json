Saints have gone five seasons without a trophy, during which they have had to become accustomed to playing second fiddle to opponents who used to be little more than a source of amusement. But the signing of Luke Walsh, an experienced scrum-half from Australia, would appear to have filled a position that has been a problem since the departure of Sean Long and left them better placed to challenge this year. Walsh could not have made a better first impression, pulling the strings masterfully in addition to kicking seven goals from as many attempts, the last of them converting his own interception try to complete a personal haul of 18 points. But he would be the first to concede that he benefited from playing behind a dominant pack. That must have been the greatest of many concerns arising from this performance for the Wolves coach, Tony Smith. Saints scored two soft tries from close range, through Kyle Amor before half-time and Anthony Laffranchi immediately after it, and the Wolves are not used to being dominated physically. This always had the potential to be a tricky transitional season for Warrington after the departures of key figures such as Brett Hodgson, Adrian Morley, Garreth Carvell and Lee Briers following their second consecutive Grand Final defeat last October \u2013 and these are ridiculously early days. Even Nathan Brown, a satisfied but far from euphoric Saints coach, stressed afterwards that Wolves will be a very different proposition when Paul Wood, Ben Harrison and Simon Grix have recovered from off-season operations. But Smith made little effort to gloss over a miserable start. \"The kicking game was right up there with the worst we've had for a while,\" he said. \"Around the ruck we weren't great, and in the second half they were way better than us. That was a bit of a kick in the backside for us.\" The first couple of minutes were entirely misleading as Warrington took a 4-0 lead with the simplest of tries from Joel Monaghan. After a heavy home defeat by Huddersfield in their opening fixture last season, the St Helens supporters packed behind the posts were entitled to fear the worst. Instead their reshaped team dominated the remainder of the first half to take a 20-4 lead. There was an element of controversy about the equalising try, as Jordan Turner's final pass to Tommy Makinson on the right wing was questionable \u2013 although Turner's centre play was so good that he deserved the benefit of the doubt. On the next Saints attack Warrington were undone by Walsh's half-back partner Gary Wheeler, who sidestepped twice off his left foot and sent James Roby over with an inside ball. Then Amor barged over and when Laffranchi followed suit, the game was up. Monaghan claimed a second try for Warrington but by then many of their supporters had headed home to complete their Valentine's Day preparations \u2013 there are advantages to stadiums with a large Tesco across the car park. For those who remained, there was only the sight of Saints rubbing Warrington's noses in it as they finished with tries from Adam Swift and finally Walsh."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
