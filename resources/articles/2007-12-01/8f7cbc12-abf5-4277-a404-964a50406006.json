A gifted pianist, guitarist and bandleader, Turner helped blaze a trail for black American music in the Fifties and Sixties. His 1951 hit, 'Rocket 88' (credited to sax player and singer Jackie Brenston) is often cited as the first rock'n'roll record. Ike backed bluesmen such as Howling Wolf in the studio, was a talent scout and put together one of the most fearsome live acts on the so-called chitlin' circuit. First called the Kings of Rhythm, Ike's band became the Ike and Tina Turner Revue after Ike had met and recruited a teenage singer, Anna Mae Bullock, in a St Louis club, then married her. Rechristened by Ike, allegedly after TV's Sheena the Jungle Queen, Tina redefined female sexuality in pop with her explosive stage persona and incendiary singing. Wailing on early hits such as 'A Fool in Love' or strutting with the Ikettes on stage, Tina was mesmerising. In a parallel world, Tina would have shot to superstardom in the late Sixties, supported by her faithful husband and producer. The reality, chillingly depicted in the 1993 biopic What's Love Got to Do with It, where Laurence Fishburne played Ike as a study of debauchery and darkness, was an abusive marriage in which Ike terrorised Tina while sinking into cocaine addiction. Ike abused Tina both physically and artistically. Never able to shake off the a quick-buck mentality, Ike oversaw a string of lacklustre almost-hits and never-were albums. Sensing a possible pay day, he let Phil Spector pitch Tina's vocals into his over-reaching 'River Deep Mountain High' in 1966, and felt vindicated when it flopped monumentally. A cover of Creedence's 'Proud Mary' in 1971, and 1973's 'Nutbush City Limits' (penned by Tina) delivered overdue hits before Tina escaped, penniless, in 1976. Ike's studio burnt down in 1982, and he finally saw jail in 1988. Clean at last after 18 months in the slammer, Ike fought back, but his 1999 autobiography, Takin' Back My Name, merely compounded his guilt ('Sure I slapped Tina, but...'), while a late flurry of solo albums and a guest spot on a Gorillaz album were just reminders of what might have been. Ike Turner was, doubtless, not all bad, but Tina's terse comment last week made a damning epitaph: 'Tina is aware that Ike passed away earlier today. She has not had any contact with him in 35 years. No further comment will be made.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
