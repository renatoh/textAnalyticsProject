While the current system is \"complex and bureaucratic\", the fund warns the health secretary's proposed reforms would make the situation worse with no regional overview and introducing three extra layers of bureaucracy \u2013 which could all disagree with each other. Faced with making \u00a320bn in \"improvement savings\" over the next four years, the fund says there are \"a number of NHS trusts for whom reconfiguration is expected to be necessary to achieve a sustainable financial position\". At present the local NHS commissioners can ultimately refer proposed closures and changes to the health secretary, advised by an independent panel, which has the final say. This government, like the previous one, has seen members of the cabinet take to the streets to defend local hospitals from closures. Candace Imison, deputy director at the fund, says that \"politicians have an important and legitimate interest in how healthcare is provided locally but too often act as a barrier, rather than facilitating the honest dialogue needed with the public\". The King's Fund says that some hospital reconfigurations take six years. To speed up the process the report argues that the secretary of state should be removed from the decision-making process \u2013 and allow experts to decide. This could be done either by allowing the independent review panel's decision to stand or appoint a special committee to make unpalatable choices, replicating a model in the Canadian province of Ontario. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 September 2011. The original stated in error that \"the overview and scrutiny committee scrutinising the proposals for Chase Farm included councillors who were elected on a 'save Chase Farm' platform and could therefore not be expected to provide impartial scrutiny of proposals\". This information was in the King's Fund report and is incorrect. It has been deleted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
