I can remember hitting with a young Goran Ivanisevic in Stockholm and thinking \"My God, this guy is playing like some of the best in the world\" - which at the time was not reflected in his ranking. And it has been the same with Andy Murray. These days a lot of the players do not have the skills to mix up their play like we saw Andy do at Wimbledon. It's a question of doing it at the right time and, as he matures, you may see a little less of it. But he has very good tactical awareness and knows exactly what his opponents like the least. He's a bit like a modern-day Miloslav Mecir, a great guy who had the ability to make anybody look inferior with the way he massaged the ball around the court. But, unlike Andy, he did not have a huge serve or forehand and that is what makes Andy so special. Of course, next year will be very different because the top players will know about him and be ready, while there will be many more expectations of his performance. But I know he will embrace the challenge with open arms. Of course there may be a levelling off, as that tends to happen to many rising players. Rafael Nadal broke through into the top 50 in 2003 and then dropped back a few places the next year when he also had injury problems. But this time next year I would expect Andy to be consolidated inside the top 30. From there it might take longer but his biggest quality is his single-mindedness, coupled with a dogged mentality. You can't buy that. The thing you notice most about the exceptionally good players is the time they have to play their shots. When Tim Henman came on the scene, Greg Rusedski was pretty much established and serving exceptionally fast, as we all know. I could only hope to block returns but Tim was able to pick up the ball so quickly and, with his excellent hand-eye coordination, could take a full swing. He would also do it when the pressure was on and this is a rare quality in a player. But I don't think that when Tim was a junior it was obvious he would do as well as he has, despite many comments to the contrary. For Tim, beating Greg to become the national champion in 1995 was the turning point and we also won the doubles together that year. What he has achieved since then is absolutely exceptional and should be acknowledged as such. I was used to playing British players and I'd always thought it was important to put yourself on the line, so nobody could accuse you of ducking out, and by and large my record was good. So I didn't mind too much when Tim came along. It would have been better for my tennis to be No2, No3 or No4 behind a Tim Henman. Anyway I knew him very well, realised I was coming to the end of my career and tried to be realistic. I brought Andy to Luxembourg for our Davis Cup tie in 2004 for the experience because he was one of Britain's best young players. At the time he had been injured a lot and we saw it as a bit of a boost for him. I suppose quite a few people were taken by surprise at the quality of his play when he teamed up with Dave Sherwood for the first time in our win against Israel earlier this year but all those who had been involved with him in the Davis Cup set-up knew he could play at that level. What we couldn't be sure of was whether he could do it under pressure and his performance that day in Tel Aviv opened a lot of people's eyes. \u00b7 Jeremy Bates is the Great Britain Davis Cup captain and former British No1, who won one ATP Tour title during his playing career - in Seoul in 1994 - and enjoyed his highest world ranking of 54 in 1995."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
