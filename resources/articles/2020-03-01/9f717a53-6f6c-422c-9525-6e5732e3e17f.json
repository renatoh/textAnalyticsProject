There are concerns that thousands of EU nationals will fail to apply to the Home Office to stay because they lack information or the means to see the digital application process through. The new EU ambassador to the UK, Jo\u00e3o Vale de Almeida, said Brussels and the embassies of the bloc\u2019s 27 member states in London needed to step up efforts to reach those on the fringes of British society. EU nationals need to apply before 31 June 2021 to remain in the UK but there is uncertainty about the number of citizens affected and the level of success in information getting through to the most cut-off groups. Vale de Almeida said a special focus was on \u201ceveryone that is for some reason outside the mainstream for socioeconomic [reasons] or age or ethnic or otherwise\u201d. He added: \u201cRoma people is a big issue as well for some countries.\u201d The embassy said EU officials have held talks with the Home Office on how those in UK prisons or in pre-trial detention could be advised of their rights. A monitoring network of 50 NGOs has been established by the EU embassy in London, which is also looking into the issue, with bimonthly meetings held to map the wider situation. Vale de Almeida, the first ever EU ambassador to the UK, said: \u201cIt is possible that at the end of this period or close to the end of the period we\u2019ll have to reassess where we are, and what are the main issues that will have to be answered to avoid too many people being left out. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s the issue of how the UK is going to treat those who for some reason, are outside of the deadline and could not make it in time,\u201d he added in an interview to mark the launch of a new Guardian series on Europe. \u201cAnd that we will have, in dialogue with UK authorities, to see how we can deal with all those problems. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying in the year and so left we have to step up our efforts.\u201d The Tory minister Brandon Lewis, when he was security minister, had suggested that those who failed to meet the deadline would face deportation. The Home Office has since clarified that it will be generous towards those who miss the cut-off through no fault of their own. There is no automatic bar on EU nationals with criminal records being allowed to stay but a prison sentence wipes out years of accumulated residence. Settled status, under which EU nationals retain similar rights to today, requires five years living in the UK. Those seeking pre-settled status must show they have been resident for some period before the end of 2020. There are 4,000 EU nationals in British prisons. The charity Unlock, which works for the rights of people with criminal convictions, estimates about 500,000 EU nationals have criminal records, in line with the proportion of the UK population. Vale de Almeida said he did not believe EU nationals needed to be alarmed by the recent deportation of 17 Jamaicans with convictions, many of whom had lived in the UK for decades. \u201cI have no reasons to make any pre-judgment on any behaviour,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the time being, we\u2019re working well with with our British [partners]. I think we need to be very attentive and try to identify cases where things are not working well.\u201d Vale de Almeida said an obstacle was the lack of firm figures on how many EU nationals are in the UK, with the latest estimates as high as 3.8 million. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us would want, you know, hundreds of thousands of citizens to be left behind,\u201d he said. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe are working with vulnerable group representatives, local authorities and other experts to ensure the right support is in place for vulnerable and \u2018at risk\u2019 citizens, be it online, over the phone, or in person. \u201cThe EU settlement scheme is as straightforward as possible and we have granted nearly 2.9 million status with over a year to go.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
