The Best of Men (BBC2) was based on the true story of Dr Ludwig Guttman, a neurologist and Jewish refugee from Germany who arrived in 1944 at Stoke Mandeville's ward for soldiers with spinal injuries and, in the course of transforming their care and treatment, founded those very Paralympic Games whose 13th incarnation opens in two weeks' time. By all accounts, Guttman worked fast, though possibly not as fast astelevision's necessary narrative compression had him work last night. The good doctor (played by Eddie Marsan) hadn't been there two minutes minutes before he was throwing open curtains, hacking off plaster casts, decatheterising all those whose urethras could take it, sluicing out bedsores and generally waging a one-man war against a medical and wider culture that told the injured that their lives not just as soldiers but as men were over. Marsan managed brilliantly to humanise a character who was, in performance terms, hopelessly unflawed: a great doctor, great family man, great shouter only at those who needed to be shouted at \u2026 A lesser actor would have struggled \u2013 and left us to struggle \u2013 to get a purchase on him. But \u2013 and this is despite being lumbered with what 'Allo 'Allo, Blackadder and countless other sitcoms and films have for ever rendered The Comedy German Accent \u2013 Marsan somehow made him real, even ven he vas encouraging his patients to \"Gif it some velly!\" at the proto-Games. Newcomer George MacKay played the paraplegic Private William Gardiner, so young and pale a stripling that you would have thought his bones would bend, not break, and Rob Brydon \u2013 playing Corporal Wynn Bowen, a wisecracker on the ward who was consumed with fear at the thought of going home to his wife and family \u2013 proving that there is no mix of comedy and tragedy, or rendition of Men of Harlech (sung after a successful night with Mrs B), that he cannot pitch just right. There are a number of dangers \u2013 apart from the German accent \u2013 inherent in telling such a story, and The Best of Men sidestepped few of them. Most of the main characters were thinly written and the minor ones a parade of cliches we have come to expect from a medical drama set in the good old bad old days \u2013 the seemingly unbending but soon-converted ward sister, the hapless bureaucrat, befuddled parents and the arrogant, paternalistic surgeon representing All That Is Wrong With The British Establishment who is eventually bested by the interloper and the patients he had once written off. But it had heart and it had soul and if the story rather than the characters was the thing \u2026 well, what a story. And any lingering doubts dissolved in the haze of tears that rose unstoppably during the final montage of shots from all the Paralympic Games since, each one suggesting that while there is still much to be done there has at least been progress in our attitudes to disability. The next four years may undo every last bit of it, if Cameron has his way, of course, but let's just leave things there for now. The world can always be divided into two types of people \u2013 those who like board games, for example, and those who don't. Those who thrill to the news that a fancy dress party is in the offing and those who shrink from it like paper from a flame. Those who will listen politely to accounts of other people's dreams and those who will beat the teller to death with the nearest stick. But none of these divides comes close to that which separates horsey people from the non-horsey. They stare at each other from across an unbridgeable chasm. Jennifer Saunders is from the former camp, I am from the latter and should therefore probably recuse myself from reviewing last night's opening episode of Jennifer Saunders: Back in the Saddle (ITV1), the story of Saunders' attempt, after a 20-year break from riding, to get ready to compete in the Grassroots Championship for elite amateurs at Badminton. It was the most profoundly boring programme I have ever seen, skimming over every opportunity to show us what it is that fascinates people about horses, or to allow them to demonstrate their expertise. The Irish horse breeders and agents particularly could and should have been given a much longer canter round their lifetime's work and passion. Instead we got Saunders gazing lovingly at tack and telling non-stories about her childhood pony. Harrumph, as I believe the disgruntled beasts themselves would put it.
