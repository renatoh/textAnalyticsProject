Worried that you are losing it too often? Or perhaps not often enough? Temper, temper - Britain is getting angrier by the day, according to Mike Fisher, founder of the British Association of Anger Management. \"Stress is very much a modern illness and the more stressed out you are, the more potential there is for anger,\" he says. \"Anger equals pain,\" says anger management guru John Lee. Whether you're an exploder (those prone to temper outbursts) or an imploder (those who bottle it up), anger is at epidemic proportions. Set up four years ago, BAAM runs workshops for those who feel they have issues with anger and stress. \"People are realising that the traditional ways of dealing with stress just aren't working - alcohol and drink do not solve problems, but instead fuel anger. Whereas people may once have used their anger creatively or gone for a run in the park - they are now making themselves too busy to do such things,\" explains Fisher. So how do you know if you've got an anger problem? Fisher says that those who suffer from migraines, ulcers, back problems, depression, or are constantly feeling on edge should take a good, hard look at themselves and ask what are the causes of their symptoms. Anger doesn't necessarily mean tantrum-throwing or violence. Many use anger to control others through eye contact (looking daggers), or by tone of voice. Finding ways of coping with anger at work can be difficult where status and seniority play a part in who can and cannot lose their temper. What is important is to find acceptable ways of expressing your anger at the person who causes such feelings.
