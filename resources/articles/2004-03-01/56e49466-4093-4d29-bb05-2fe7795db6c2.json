In this week's Backbencher: Prescott stands in, Boris gets shirty and trespassers may be shot &gt;&gt;&gt; FROM WESTMINSTER The Backbencher asked Guardian sketch writer Simon Hoggart what he made of John Prescott's stand-in performance at prime minister's questions. \"It's always a very exciting moment for us when Prescott takes over. Whenever he can, Tony Blair tries to be in the country for PMQs, partly because he sees it as his 'hotline to the British people', but also to stop John Prescott from doing it. The very first time he stood in, he made terrible mistakes, confusing one question with another. It was all rather pitiable, and so the Tories always look forward to really humiliating him. \"But he's learned how to cope over the years, and he's actually doing much better now. His technique is to speak in a long monotone, to read the brief very carefully, to think before he speaks and, on the whole, he's fairly successful. The Tories tried to get him on Mr Blair's visit to Libya tomorrow, making the point that Libya has a lot to answer for: the Lockerbie bombing, the murder of PC Yvonne Fletcher and so on. Michael Ancram warned that Mr Blair should 'sup with a very long spoon' when he met the Libyan leader. But it was a pretty feeble point, because either you talk to people or you don't, and the government seems very pleased to have brought Libya back into the international fold. Menzies Campbell, the deputy leader of the Lib Dems, then stood up and said 'well, we support it' - effectively flipping his Tory counterpart aside. \"So the Tories really didn't get very far with what you might call straightforward questions. But they did get Mr Prescott on one thing: he claimed that taxes had gone down since Labour came to power, and that is not the case. You have to do some pretty drastic massaging of statistics to make that appear to be true. \"Peter Lough asked him if he was going to support the Campaign for Plain English - obviously a joke at Mr Prescott's expense - and rather effectively stood up and said 'well, the honourable member may get his grammar right, but all his politics are wrong'. The Labour backbenches cheered - they'd clearly been briefed by the whips to give Mr Prescott a very easy ride. \"Later, Edward Garnier, a Tory lawyer, asked him if he thought Peter Mandelson was the right choice for the new commissioner in Brussels. It's well known that Mr Prescott has very little time for Mr Mandelson - he used to refer to him and his other well dressed, modernising MPs as 'the beautiful people', and that wasn't meant kindly. But the DPM didn't take the bait. He just said 'there's so much talent on our benches that it's going to be very difficult for the prime minister to decide who to appoint'. And that shut Mr Garnier up. \"Then, as we got towards the end of the session, Mr Prescott began to relax, probably thinking he'd be OK. He began to let his syntax go to pot, as he so often does. The last question was on heart disease, and he responded with: 'We're winning the heart disease'. \"But he left the chamber with a great big smile on his face, no doubt satisfied that he'd done a very difficult job very effectively.\" &gt;&gt;&gt; LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION Jake Eliot wins last week's competition by identifying the NSPCC as the Baroness's favourite charity: \"The children in need of protection were one of the very few groups who could not be held responsible for their own condition,\" he explains. A couple of readers made wholly inappropriate allusions to Scrooge and the withdrawal of free school milk. In fact, Scrooge favoured state provision for the poor; as he pointed out, the \"treadmill and the Poor Law\" removed the need for charity. &gt;&gt;&gt; THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION Tony is due to visit the Colonel in Tripoli tomorrow. And tortuous though it was, the Backbencher felt compelled to take a look at Gadafy's 1975 work, the Green Book. If you can bear it, tell the Backbencher why the Colonel believes plebiscites are a \"fraud against democracy\" - and whoever paraphrases the ex-tyrant's thought processes most accurately will win a copy of Robert Cooper's The Breaking of Nations: Order and Chaos in the 21st Century. Published by Atlantic Books, the book is a tightly-written primer on post-cold war politics by one of Tony's former advisers. Email backbencher@guardianunlimited.co.uk. &gt;&gt;&gt; A NOSTRADAMUS FOR OUR TIMES The Backbencher thought the regrettable fashion for politicians' blogs had reached its nadir in Simon Hughes's Simon Says. But the genre has just plumbed new depths with the launch of Scottish MEP Catherine Stihler's effort. She may well return to this oeuvre next week, but readers may enjoy this insight from March 22: \"Woke up to hear the news about the Hamas leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, being killed by an Israeli missile. I think that this will have serious consequences.\" &gt;&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT WHAT YOU KNOW... The FT tipped PR man Howell James as Tony's new head of communications today. (Sorry, \"permanent secretary in charge of government communications\", as we must now all call it.) Not only would this be an admirable coup for Howell - who sat on the very review committee that recommended the creation of the job - but it would also be the second post he has held in Downing Street: he used to advise John Major. Even more remarkably, he used to go out with Peter Mandelson's current partner. Will he get the job? Do revolving doors spin? &gt;&gt;&gt; WAR ON PEACE Meanwhile, just who is the \"minister close to Operation Fortress Commons\" who apparently believes that the Greenpeace protesters who climbed Big Ben should have been shot? \"If somebody scaled the White House, they would be shot immediately,\" the libertarian told the Mirror. \"Shoot-to-kill sounds incredibly extreme but until people see that we have such measures in place we will continue to be seen as a joke. The intruders at the weekend were very lucky not to be made an example of. The next people who try such a stunt might not be so lucky.\" Shot dead? Or locked up without a trial? It's no kind of a choice, really, and it's just as well that Mr Blunkett doesn't want you to have to make it. &gt;&gt;&gt; AS CUNNING AS A FOX The Tories' efforts to explain their new pupil passport policy drag on relentlessly. \"Not one penny of subsidy will be available for those who send their children to fee-paying schools,\" Tim Collins told the Commons last week. \"I can tell from the look of shock and disappointment crossing the secretary of state's face that he realises that I have shot his fox. Let me make it clear, however, that this fox has been not just shot, but shelled, napalmed and obliterated.\" But what exactly is a fee-paying school? According to one of the party's education advisers, Tim Chatwin, it is a school that charges more than the value of the passport. In other words, parents who send their offspring to a fee-paying school will pay all the fees; and those who don't, won't. All very fine, but the Backbencher is intrigued to discover just how this will differ from the current system. This fox will run and run. &gt;&gt;&gt; BLOND AMBITION Thanks to the Boris Johnson Fan Club for drawing attention to a garment the Backbencher hopes not to see in Westminster this summer: an XXXXL (54\"-56\") T-shirt sporting a blue sketch of the ubiquitous MP's head and the word \"BORIS\". Yes, but would it fit Soames? &gt;&gt;&gt; THIS WEEK AT QUESTION TIME \"'You need to secure agreements by talking - talk and talk,' says Mr Prescott. I make no comment ...\" Matthew Tempest reports from a verbose session of PMQs. &gt;&gt;&gt; FORTHCOMING EVENTS * Who runs this country? Good question.
