But the striker, who now sits seven short of the Swede's record, was denied his hat-trick when he was replaced just two minutes before the Scottish champions were handed a penalty converted instead by Kenny Miller. Pedro Moutinho had pulled a goal back for the SPL's bottom side, but Walter Smith's men held on for the victory that keeps them in second place, two points behind Celtic. Hibernian also remain two points from the top of the league, but behind Rangers on goal difference, after an impressive 2-0 home win over Motherwell. Anthony Stokes gave Hibs the lead shortly before half-time when he ran on to a lofted pass from Derek Riordan to slot home despite offside appeals from the visitors. In the second half, a Stokes shot found the net via a deflection off Colin Nish in the 55th minute and Hibees put on a stylish display without further reward. Dundee United beat St Mirren 3-2 despite a moment of madness from midfielder Morgaro Gomis. United were cruising to victory thanks to first-half goals from Damian Casalinuovo and a free-kick from Craig Conway before Gomis was sent off, apparently for lashing out at Stephen McGinn. Saints immediately pulled a goal back when a Chris Innes header deflected in off Darren Dods, but Jennison Myrie-Williams appeared to have made the game safe for the Tangerines late on before the substitute Stephen O'Donnell's neat chip set up a grandstand finish in a bad-tempered clash at Tannadice. The Tayside team stay in touch with the pack in fourth position, two points behind Hibs with a game in hand. Kevin Kyle was the matchwinner as his goal guided Kilmarnock to their second away victory of 2009 and a 1-0 victory at St Johnstone. Kyle, the Killie captain, pounced on a ball from strike partner Mark Burchill to make Saints pay for some slipshod defending after 15 minutes. The McDiarmid Park team enjoyed the upper hand throughout and carved out the better opportunities, but failed to score for the first time in a home match this season. Hearts travel to Hamilton today looking to build on last Saturday's victory over Kilmarnock. Jos\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves returns for Csaba Laszlo's team, having completed his suspension, and injury doubt Lee Wallace should recover to play some part in the match."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
