The British-American Hodgson Burnett is best remembered today for her The Secret Garden, the 1911 tale of a girl who comes from India to the isolated Yorkshire moors, and 1886\u2019s Little Lord Fauntleroy, about a poor boy from Brooklyn who discovers he has inherited an English estate. But 10 years before she died in 1924, Hodgson Burnett began writing a series of sketches that mixed autobiography with fiction. Published in Good Housekeeping magazine, the stories appeared under the title The Romantick Lady \u2013 a \u201ccipher for the author\u2019s imaginative and more fanciful side\u201d, said British Library editor Johnny Davidson. One of them, The Christmas in the Fog, published in April 1915, was recently found among the British Library\u2019s papers. The story sees the author dealing with two incidents \u2013 a trip on a liner to New York surrounded by fog, and an encounter with a \u201cshabby little boy, carrying a small bundle\u201d. \u201cHis face was white, and his eyes had that horribly bewept, almost blinded look one shudders before when one sees it in an older person. That a child\u2019s face and eyes should look so was inhuman \u2013 unnatural,\u201d she writes. Davidson said the story explores \u201chow, in certain real situations, everyone becomes strange, ghostly, and comparable to an \u2018actual\u2019 supernatural ghost story\u201d. A foghorn, for example, is described as having \u201ca wild and hollow roar such as a Megatherium, as it rooted up and trampled down great trees in a primeval forest in darkest ages, might have bellowed in his lonely rage\u201d. \u201cThe remoteness, the sense of being at once shut in and shut out from the world, from life itself, was an uncanny and spectral thing. A new-born ghost wandering in ghostly spaces as yet unknown, might have felt it,\u201d writes Hodgson Burnett. Along with forgotten works by women writers whom the British Library says \u201cpioneered and developed the \u2018weird tale\u2019 in the early 20th century\u201d, The Christmas in the Fog will be reissued by the library\u2019s publishing imprint in the anthology Queens of the Abyss, out later this year. Other stories in the anthology include May Sinclair\u2019s tale of what editor Mike Ashley called \u201ca risqu\u00e9 phantom love\u201d, and works from Marie Corelli, Violet Quirk and Greye La Spina and Margaret St Clair. In his introduction, Ashley writes that many of the writers \u201chad to rise from the abyss of poverty or other adversity in their childhood or married lives\u201d and \u201cit is possible to see how they channelled the anguish of their disadvantaged lives into their fiction, making it all the more real\u201d. Hodgson Burnett grew up in straitened circumstances after the death of her father. The family immigrated to the US in 1865, and the young writer helped to support her family by publishing stories. She married and divorced twice \u2013 considered scandalous at the time \u2013 and had two sons, one of whom, Lionel, died as a teenager."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
