Boggs said she sometimes downloaded dozens of songs on any given day, including ones by Fleetwood Mac, Blondie, Incubus and Busta Rhymes. Since Boggs used her roommates' Internet account, the roommates' name and address was being turned over to music industry lawyers. \"This scares me so bad I never want to download anything again,\" said Boggs, who turned 22 on Thursday. \"I never thought this would happen. There are millions of people out there doing this.\" See the AP report for the full story."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
