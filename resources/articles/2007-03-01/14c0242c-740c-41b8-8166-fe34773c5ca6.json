So it is perhaps fitting that a real, if not particularly dangerous, car crash has contributed to the spirit that could yet carry Charlton to safety. It happened during the trip to Spain that preceded the 4-0 thrashing of West Ham nine days ago. \"That trip really helped,\" said Luke Young. \"We did a bit of go-karting, though I won't be doing that again in a hurry. Me and Alex Song crashed in two consecutive races. I was a bit worried about doing it in the first place, but everyone else did, so I felt I had no choice.\" When he and Song combined on Saturday it was with comparably destructive results. From the Cameroonian's pass Young prodded past Richard Lee to score Charlton's first and inspire a renewed sense of purpose that brought a late equaliser and will now be dragged into their next fixtures, at home to Newcastle and Wigan. Charlton will hope that their season comes to mirror this match: unimpressive until the closing stages but unbeaten at its conclusion. Song, on loan from Arsenal for the remainder of the campaign, represents a good reason for optimism. His languid style was capitalised on by Watford in the first half, when he was too easily beaten to - and off - the ball by motivated opponents. But given more space towards the end of the game he showed vision and precision that could trouble the best defences. A right-footed pass created a wonderful chance for Matt Holland, a left-footed pass set up Young, and a crossfield ball allowed Dennis Rommedahl to cross for Darren Ambrose's equaliser. Charlton could have won at the end, and surely would have done had Kevin Lisbie passed to the unmarked Darren Bent instead of shooting at the goalkeeper, but there should have been no chance of a comeback after an abject first-half performance. \"We were a shambles at the start,\" said Young. \"This was only my second game for the new manager and the first time I've seen him angry.\" The manager, Alan Pardew, pointed to the fact that three defenders - Hermann Hreidarsson, Ben Thatcher and Souleymane Diawara -were absent. Some of those who did play might as well have been with them. Talal El Karkouri, having appeared in all but one of Charlton's 29 league games this season, can hardly be considered a reserve. But he was shockingly poor: one attempted overhead clearance, humiliatingly fluffed to present Tamas Priskin with a clear run on goal, was so bad that Pardew should consider some form of punitive action. Players whose unacceptably thoughtless behaviour damages their team's cause are routinely fined; a couple of weeks' wages would not be disproportionate. At least Priskin did not score, though twice, when players crossed with ease despite being supposedly covered by El Karkouri, Watford did. But as so often happens, the Hornets could not hold their lead. They have been taught many lessons this season, some of them several times, but on Saturday their manager, Aidy Boothroyd, felt that he had learned one of his own. \"You've always got to aim for the skies,\" he said. \"If one or two clubs maybe aimed a little bit higher with the quality they've got, maybe this league would be a bit more exciting, rather than waiting for the top four to win all the time. I think you've got to push for the heights.\" In the first half Watford finally seemed ready to take flight, but again the fog descended. The clouds have rarely lifted from this corner of Hertfordshire of late, but the good news is that clouds in this division are lined not with silver but gold, and lots of it. Boothroyd will surely aim for the skies again next season and he should at least be able to afford some expensive ammunition.
