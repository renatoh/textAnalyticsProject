Oasis Dream, last year's champion two-year-old, caught and passed him at the two-furlong pole, but though he leaves Britain as a beaten horse, he is no less of a hero for that. No less of a pioneer, either. Newmarket was crawling with Australian camera crews yesterday, a sign of the excitement that Choisir's exploits have generated back home, and Paul Perry, his trainer, believes that others will follow his lead. \"He ran very courageously,\" Perry said. \"We've come over and done our job, and it's been a great effort. Johnny Murtagh [Choisir's jockey] summed it up right. The winner was the fresh horse trained for the race.\" Fresh, and supremely fit. Oasis Dream finished third behind Choisir in the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot, his first apperance of the season, but John Gosden, his trainer, admitted that he was \"no more than 80%\" for that race. The Oasis Dream who turned out yesterday, though, was far closer to the colt who broke the track record in the Middle Park Stakes last autumn. He still looked puny next to Choisir in the paddock, but then so did all the rest of the 16 runners. The Australian horse is built like the Hulk, and he was so quickly away from his stall against the far rails that you felt he might have simply muscled his way through the gates a second early. At Ascot, though, Choisir's dominance was complete from the off. Yesterday, Oasis Dream kept him within easy reach, and was travelling comfort ably as he did so. Richard Hughes moved alongside with a quarter of a mile to run, and sealed the victory with a final burst of speed in the last 100 yards. \"We knew we had to go out and attack Choisir because he's an exceptional sprinter,\" Gosden said. \"We saw what he did at Ascot and he had the plum draw in one. \"Oasis Dream broke a length slow but he made it up in 50 yards, and halfway through the race Richard had the reins flapping and he was cruising. I knew that when he picked him up there would be a lot to come.\" Gosden will now steer the obvious course towards the Nunthorpe Stakes at York and the Sprint Cup at Haydock, although he feels that Oasis Dream may move up from sprinting in time. \"We did at one time think he might be a Guineas horse,\" the trainer said, \"and there is certainly the stamina for a mile on his dam's side, but he just did not come right in the spring. We could have forced him and gone for a Guineas trial, but if we'd done that, we would have had a used-up horse and we wouldn't be here today.\" Another Ascot failure came good in the Bunbury Cup, won from the front by Patavellian, who was the beaten favourite in the Wokingham Handicap. The punters did not abandon him, though, and sent him off at the head of the market again yesterday, a position he is also likely to occupy in the Stewards' Cup at Goodwood next month. Patavellian was travelling supremely well for most of yesterday's seven furlongs, although he was clinging on at the end when Mine, last year's winner, emerged from the pack to chase him. \"On that, he's a six-furlong horse, not a seven-furlong horse, which is what I always thought before the Wokingham,\" Roger Charlton, Patavellian's trainer, said. \"He never got into it at Ascot, but I hope the punters got their money back today.\" Charlton feels that Patavellian is a more likely runner in the Stewards' Cup than Move It, who was a winner here on Tuesday. Patavellian was initially quoted at 9-1 for the Goodwood race by Paddy Power yesterday, but that had contracted to 7-1 before he was even back in his horsebox. The 8-1 offered by William Hill this morning is unlikely to survive much longer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
