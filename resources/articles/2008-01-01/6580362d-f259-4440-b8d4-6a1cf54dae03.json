The first minister Alex Salmond pledged in his party's pre-election manifesto that it would smash quangos to end \"overlap and duplication\". The move was an attempt to save \u00a33.2bn in unnecessary government spending and it put the national sports agency firmly in Salmond's sights, with the assumption being that everything would be brought in-house into the Scottish executive's Sports Division. But, having drawn back from immediately abolishing the sports quango in favour of a review that was conducted by the department of sport, it now appears Sportscotland will be granted a further stay of execution. In their feedback to the review panel, there was overwhelming consensus from sports governing bodies that, four years from the London Olympics and six years from the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, it would be madness to do away with what is Scottish sport's chief funding distributor. Sportscotland is responsible for financing all sport from grassroots to elite participation. Under national lottery guidelines, government departments are forbidden from making distributions - although the 2012 Olympics has proved a notable exception. The lack of forethought to the manifesto pledge appears set to torpedo the SNP's sports plans. Sutcliffe calls for Coward Fresh from the appointment of its director of security, Ben Gunn, as a lead party in tennis's review of its anti-corruption structures, the British Horseracing Authority is set to receive another ringing endorsement for the positive impact it can have on such issues. The BHA's chief executive, Nic Coward will head to the Department of Culture, Media and Sport offices in a fortnight to discuss with the sports minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, the betting-related integrity risks facing sport. Coward is working with the Central Council for Physical Recreation, who have commissioned a research paper to be conducted by gambling experts at the University of Salford, which is seen as a positive step as sport attempts to protect itself from new threats. There will also be discussions about how to fund anti-corruption programmes. The developments prove that the BHA's standing has not been diminished by the collapse of the Kieron Fallon trial, which Gunn hinted was down to the failings of the City of London police. Bucknor staying silent The International Cricket Council insists it has not hung Steve Bucknor out to dry by removing the umpire from the schedule of officials at the third Test in Perth. Yet despite Bucknor being the world's most experienced umpire the ICC appeared to be gagging him yesterday. In response to an official interview request the ICC refused to allow him to put his side of the story, stating: \"Only Malcolm Speed is commenting on the issue.\" Turf TV turned on There is confidence at Turf TV that the two bookmakers who still refuse to take its racing coverage in their betting shops will soon sign up. Negotiations are ongoing with William Hill and Betfred after the pair were isolated by their competitors Ladbrokes and Coral, who subscribed over the festive period. Both Hill's outgoing chief executive, David Harding, and Betfred's founder, Fred Done, have spoken out about the dispute, Done saying: \"I'll be the last one out of the trenches in this battle\". His company announced last month it would postpone a \u00a3600m stockmarket flotation amid \"turbulence\" in the finance markets while Turf TV's owner, Alphameric, saw its shares rise more than 10% when Ladbrokes signed up. Creepy-crawlies win gold The Olympic village will not be the site of the only new homes built for London 2012. Yesterday organisers embarked on construction of an on-site nature reserve that will be the haven for endangered insects displaced by the other demolition and building works. matt.scott@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
