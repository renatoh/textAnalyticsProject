The Louis Vuitton menswear designer and the founder of the streetwear brand Off-White is known for having a cult following, which explains the throngs who turned up next to a rainy North Circular to buy items from his 15-piece collection. The designs include a backlit take on the Mona Lisa for \u00a365 and a chair with a doorstop attached to one of its legs (\u00a399). Called Markerad, the collection has been generating huge amounts of buzz since it was announced at Paris fashion week last year. When free tickets for the launch were released online on 9 October they sold out in less than five minutes. Billed as the \u201cworld\u2019s comfiest queue\u201d, the scattered sofas were not plentiful enough to go around in the final hour. People came from as far away as Italy and as nearby as the end of the Central Line \u2013 midwife Tara Spurrs arrived after a nightshift to check on her 16-year-old son at the front of the queue \u2013 and several stayed overnight. Many of those waiting were big fans of Abloh. \u201cVirgil\u2019s done it and I like Off-White,\u201d said Leon Henry, 19, a construction worker who was first in line, arriving at 10am on Thursday and surviving on a diet of UberEats. Andrew Maksymowski, 27, who travelled from Manchester to be there, said: \u201cHis designs are quite innovative. People hate him as well, which I quite like. I think he\u2019s interesting and different to what normal designers are like, so I have a lot of respect for him.\u201d Abloh-designed Ikea rugs sold for thousands on resale sites earlier this year and many in the queue were hoping to make some money from their purchases. Jos\u00e9 Martins, 29, who has previously resold items from the skate brands Supreme and Palace, already had a buyer willing to pay \u00a3700 for one of the \u00a3200 rugs. \u201cBasically we are buying Louis Vuitton stuff for the price of Ikea,\u201d he said. But not everyone planned to resell their purchases. Maksymowski said he was \u201clooking for some new furniture for my flat and I\u2019ve always really liked Virgil Abloh\u201d. Among the items generating the most buzz is a wall clock, priced at \u00a325, decorated with the word \u201ctemporary\u201d and a rug that reads \u201cwet grass\u201d, costing \u00a3199. Another rug is made to resemble an Ikea receipt and is going for \u00a375. As J Frank, 21, explained: \u201cIt\u2019s almost taking the piss; it\u2019s a bit meta. You\u2019re paying for an Ikea receipt that you\u2019re going to receive when you buy it.\u201d Abloh throws light on the collection on Ikea\u2019s website: \u201cIt\u2019s about elevating the anonymous, everyday icons that we use without noticing.\u201d Inside the store, Isabel Carbafho, 21, said: \u201cIt\u2019s just a bit mad really, you don\u2019t really see this stuff \u2026 [plus] everyone can actually afford to buy it, which usually with Off-White you couldn\u2019t do.\u201d Waiting in line has become a modern phenomenon in recent years thanks to the world of streetwear and Carbafho explained how \u201cto be able to say that you queued overnight, and went to this launch, is quite a nice thing to be a part of\u201d. She and her friends had been taking it in turns to nap since midnight. It is not the first time Ikea has found itself at the centre of a fashion storm \u2013 in 2017 the influential label Balenciaga sold a design uncannily similar to Ikea\u2019s blue and yellow Frakta bag for \u00a31,365. The Markerad collection will be on sale at the Wembley, Croydon and Dublin stores until 3 November for those with tickets"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
