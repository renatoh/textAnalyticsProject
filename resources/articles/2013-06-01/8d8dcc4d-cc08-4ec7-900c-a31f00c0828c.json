After more than two decades at Threadneedle Street, the Bank of England governor steps down at the end of this month. Unsurprisingly, Sir Mervyn's recent interventions have had a allowable tinge of sepia. Yesterday's address was no different. \"A game of two halves,\" ran a trademark sporting metaphor. \"Full of incident, with a red card or two and a passionate and at times justifiably angry crowd.\" A better summary might be the joke regularly made by the politician who dominated Sir Mervyn's time more than any other. \"There are two kinds of chancellor,\" Gordon Brown liked to quip. \"Those who fail and those who get out in time.\" The same goes for central bankers. Had Alan Greenspan retired before the subprime crash he might have clung onto the nickname of \"the oracle\"; but those extra years brought him professional humiliation. Similarly, after succeeding Eddie George in 2003, Sir Mervyn spent three years practically walking on water \u2013 before being hit by a once-in-a-lifetime cataclysm. Sir Mervyn was at the Bank long enough and in high enough positions that the institution came to be moulded in his image. Before the collapse of Northern Rock, the governor's lack of interest in regulating financial markets was legendary. One of the Bank's two core purposes remained \"to ensure financial stability\", yet staff presenting updates on the issue recall the governor falling asleep in briefings. They drew a clear inference: if you want to get ahead, get into macroeconomic modelling. That concentration of talent was to have disastrous consequences during the credit crisis. Sir Mervyn kept fretting about the signal that would be sent if he provided liquidity to distressed banks, so that the effect was rather like a fireman worrying about the moral implications of dousing an arsonist's blaze: fine, until the entire street is engulfed in flames. Sir Mervyn's initial qualms about handing Bank cash to reckless financiers were justified, but he nursed them long after it had become apparent that the scale of the crisis made such concerns academic. The same laggardly tendencies could be seen as the financial meltdown turned into an economic one: he failed to spot that coming, too. In September 2008, MPs asked Sir Mervyn how worried he was about high unemployment. His answer? \"The Almighty has not vouchsafed to me the path of unemployment data over the next year.\" Such remarks smack of dire complacency, especially given the urgent calls from those, among them this paper, who could see the looming dangers and calling for the Bank to get real and cut interest rates further and faster. Whatever would have happened, the British economy was in for a painful recession in 2008-09; but through his inaction, Sir Mervyn made it worse. In both cases, once he cottoned on to the scale of the problem the Bank governor worked with impressive ability and imagination. His prescriptions for Britain's broken banking system have been far stronger and less beholden to the City than almost any of his peers. This paper may not agree with the quantitative-easing programme of buying hundreds of billions of pounds of gilts, but at least it shows a Bank unwilling to sit idle during a crash (compare that with Jean-Claude Trichet's European Central Bank). And Sir Mervyn has often acquitted himself with humour, huge intellect and a roundedness of character. But he has unwisely meddled in politics, such as criticising Alistair Darling's deficit-reduction plans. What all this points to is a central bank that has become ever more politically powerful even while remaining cordoned-off from full democratic accountability. The same trend can be seen in the US and Europe, as central bankers take more unorthodox policies in order to secure economic recovery. More often than not, Sir Mervyn deployed his growing powers with a sense of where the lines lay; one may wonder if all of his successors will show similar judgment. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 June 2013.

Lack of interest is what was meant."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
