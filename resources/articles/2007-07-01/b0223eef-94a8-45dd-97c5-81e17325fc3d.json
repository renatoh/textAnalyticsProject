The triple jumper Idowu, winner of the first Golden League event of the season in Oslo, had not recovered sufficiently from a back injury to compete in Rome last night and so is missing out Sheffield. Benjamin, who finished fifth in the 400 metres in the 2005 world championships, has a foot strain. The British long jump record holder, Chris Tomlinson, meanwhile, is bouncing back from injury and hopes to continue his recent run of form in Sheffield after improving on his own record by two centimetres last week with a leap of 8.29m. \"Now is the time to build on it,\" he said yesterday as he stepped up his preparations for the world championships in Osaka next month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
