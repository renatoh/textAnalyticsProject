The main broadcasters have proposed their own respective formats after Labour accepted a challenge from the prime minister to debate with Corbyn about her Brexit deal on live television. The BBC\u2019s would include a panel of 20 prominent commentators that are equally split between supporting and opposing May\u2019s Brexit deal, while Sky and ITV\u2019s bid would be a more straightforward head-to-head. Labour has claimed the BBC format would be \u201cmessy and confusing\u201d, and presents May with the opportunity to cast her opponents as divided since one side would be unanimous in its support for her plan. \u201cTheresa May said she wanted a head-to-head debate with me on her botched Brexit deal and I am ready to do that,\u201d tweeted the Labour leader. \u201cITV have a straightforward plan. If she and her team prefer BBC, she should join me in asking them to arrange an actual head-to-head debate.\u201d His comments followed an increasingly bitter row over whether the BBC had discussed a May-Corbyn debate with Downing Street before Sunday, when the Telegraph reported that the prime minister had challenged the Labour leader. The broadcaster then appeared to encourage Corbyn to accept its format in a tweet that said May had accepted the offer. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted she\u2019s agreed and hope to hear soon from the Labour party,\u201d the BBC press team wrote on Thursday. The row was said to have highlighted the influence of May\u2019s communications chief, Robbie Gibb, who until last year was the BBC\u2019s head of political programming and was responsible for organising the corporation\u2019s election debates. Labour-supporting campaigners also pointed to other high-profile appointments made by senior Tory ministers from the BBC as evidence that the corporation is currently biased towards the government. \u201cThe ball is in Labour\u2019s court,\u201d said a Downing Street source on Saturday. May has said she will only take part in a debate against Corbyn, not any hard Brexiter, such as Boris Johnson, or any campaigner for a second referendum, saying the country had moved on from the leave versus remain argument. She said her TV debate with the Labour leader would not be about the same arguments as the 2016 referendum, during which there were multiple live debates from all factions. Anti-Brexit campaigners have argued that excluding smaller parties from the debate is undemocratic. On Saturday evening the BBC said: \u201cOur proposal is to broadcast a programme which includes both a head-to-head debate between the prime minister and the leader of the opposition and also an opportunity to hear from a wider range of voices. \u201cAfter all, a broad range of views on this issue is held by the public and by parliamentarians \u2013 from those who want a different form of Brexit to those who want another public vote \u2013 and we believe that should be reflected in the debate.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
