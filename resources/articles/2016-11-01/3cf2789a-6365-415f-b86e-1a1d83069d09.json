The Crystal Palace midfielder says his international team-mates still \u201chammer\u201d the Real Madrid forward for anything and everything, including a resemblance to Tarzan. Bale is projected to earn \u00a3150m over the next six years in salaries and bonuses after agreeing an extended deal with Real that runs until 2022, meaning he picks up more in a week than Chris Coleman, the Wales manager, in a year. There is a similar disparity between Bale and some other members of the Wales squad in terms of their wage packets, yet Ledley said the 27-year-old remained \u201cone of the boys\u201d and had not altered in the slightest from the days when he was playing for Southampton. \u201cHe deserves every penny and whatever he gets in life,\u201d Ledley said. \u201cHe\u2019s proven to be one of the greatest players on this planet. There is no jealousy whatsoever. We have known Gareth since he was a boy at Southampton and I haven\u2019t seen any change in him at all \u2013 that is brilliant on his behalf. \u201cPeople can change in football and go different ways but he has just stayed on that straight and narrow line and remained the same person. \u201cHe\u2019s just one of the boys \u2013 we don\u2019t care who he is, we will still hammer him and he will hammer us. That\u2019s the banter we have here. If you ask him, he loves meeting up with Wales and that is the togetherness we have in this squad. It doesn\u2019t matter who anybody is. We are all together as a team and you can\u2019t treat anybody different to anybody else. We are all equal.\u201d Asked what the players give their talisman most stick about, Ledley mentioned Bale\u2019s \u201cbarnet\u201d and recalled the moment last month during the 1-1 draw against Georgia when his team-mate had a bad hair day. \u201cWe saw that [when his bun collapsed and his hair fell down], we had him a bit for that. He looked like Tarzan,\u201d Ledley said, laughing. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of banter going on around the place. We play golf together and, if he duffs one, then we are on his back because he\u2019s pretty good at golf. That\u2019s depressing, actually \u2013 I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s not good at.\u201d Wales will need Bale to be at his best on the pitch on Saturday, when they take on Serbia in Cardiff in a World Cup group qualifying tie. Wales have not lost a competitive match at home since Serbia beat them 3-0 in September 2013. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the best performance but we have come a long way from there,\u201d Ledley said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a totally different game to then. We\u2019ve come on leaps and bounds and progressed very well. Experience has been vital and we\u2019ve gelled together as a unit. We\u2019re still undefeated in this competition and we want to keep it that way.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
