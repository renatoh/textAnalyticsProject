Seizing the opportunity provided by RBS's regime change, George Osborne drew a line under the hostile relations with former boss, Stephen Hester, and got himself snapped sipping tea with the new man, Ross McEwan, in a cycle store. The message? The bank and its unwilling owner, the Treasury, were now of one mind \u2013 and pushing hard on the pedals to revive the institution and aid a wider recovery. The substance of the plan, insofar as it was there, involved confirming that RBS's toxic debts would not be split into a separate bank, but would be separately managed internally with a view to earlyish disposal. The markets were unimpressed, pushing RBS shares down 8% at one point. Lifting the threat of division was supposed to reassure investors, but few were ever spooked by it. Much talked about in 2008-09, when it might have made a difference, it was only ever on the agenda in 2013 because the great and the (more debatably) good, in the form of Nigel Lawson and Mervyn King, told the banking commission in March that they favoured a split. Seeing most of the poison had already been drained from RBS's balance sheet by this point, this intervention smacked of clever men scrambling around for something clever to say. By this stage of the game, it was never going to happen. But with no real strategy for RBS of his own, the chancellor was rattled, and commissioned a costly review, complete with Rothschild's analysis, which duly served up yesterday's obvious conclusions. A separate, and more interesting, report for the bank itself on Friday highlighted failings in the way that RBS is serving (or too often not serving) small business. At least Mr McEwan displays some interest in this shortcoming, but \u2013 while necessary \u2013 better customer service is far from sufficient. For, as the whole world discovered in 2008, the problems here go deeper than that. Here is a fatally over-stretched global empire attempting to transform itself into something more mundane. That would be a painful transition at any time, but competing pressures worsen the plight: RBS is told to get more money out into the real economy, but also to squirrel more away in its vaults. Then there is a chancellor, itching for the earliest privatisation he can get, breathing down its neck. The bank is keen not merely to restart paying dividends, but to shrug off a stricture, imposed as part of the bailout, that the government must receive these before anyone else. This is a demand for a return to business as usual. How extraordinary that after all the bankruptcies and the bailout, we missed the chance for a wider debate about what we want finance to do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
