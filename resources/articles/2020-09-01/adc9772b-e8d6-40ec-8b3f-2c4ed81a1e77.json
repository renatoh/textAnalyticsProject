Alternatively, if you are decorating a period room, he suggests choosing a wallpaper that has been in production for a long time. Cole &amp; Son, for example, has been creating patterns since 1875 and many of its contemporary designs are reworkings of historic block-print papers. Often, it\u2019s a simple tweak to scale and a fresh set of colourways that lend its historic patterns a contemporary edge. \u201cAt a less high-end cost,\u201d Pentreath continues, \u201cI use a lot of Morris &amp; Co papers, as these seem to belong beautifully in houses of all periods.\u201d Pentreath has spent the summer recolouring a selection of Morris &amp; Co wallpapers and fabrics. The new collection is set to launch this autumn and will no doubt combine the lushness of William Morris\u2019s 19th-century designs with Pentreath\u2019s peppy approach to colour. \u201cIf your architecture is more neutral, then I\u2019d say the sky is the limit when it comes to mixing styles,\u201d he says. By all means go bold and rich, but be careful not to overdo it in space which you spend a lot of time relaxing in, he cautions. \u201cI\u2019d tend to choose something calm and more neutral in my bedroom, such as the brilliant dragged papers by Farrow &amp; Ball \u2013 but then go wild and have fun in the hallways, WCs and guest bedrooms.\u201d benpentreath.com \u2018Try textured vinyl\u2019 Clare Gaskin, interior designer \u201cWhen clients say they don\u2019t like wallpaper, most of the time I ignore them,\u201d admits interior designer Clare Gaskin. \u201cOften, it\u2019s simply because they haven\u2019t been exposed to enough of it. That\u2019s my job: to sift through the options and find what\u2019s appropriate.\u201d For Gaskin, wallpaper is both functional and decorative. On a recent project, she was confronted with an awkward anteroom dissected by four sets of doors. To unify the space she papered the walls and the doors in Cole &amp; Son\u2019s Clock Court. She has also used wallpaper to make a feature of plain doors. \u201cOne of my clients had a sliding door that separated the dining room from the kitchen,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe papered it in Cole &amp; Son\u2019s Antique Mirror, which gave the door the appearance of a vintage foxed mirror. Now when you draw the door across, it functions more like a piece of art.\u201d (For papered areas that are going to be frequently touched, she recommends applying a coat of decorator\u2019s varnish.) Gaskin has also recently used faux grasscloth, such as Chandbali by Villa Nova, in several projects. These vinyl coverings have the textured appearance of natural grasscloth, which is made from handwoven strands of natural fibres and is both delicate and expensive. \u201cI\u2019m always recommending textured vinyl beyond the kitchen and bathroom,\u201d she explains. \u201cParticularly in busy households with children. Why not have something that looks just as good as an expensive covering, but that you can take a sponge to should something happen?\u201d claregaskin.com \u2018Wallpaper your ceiling\u2019 Ottoline de Vries, wallpaper designer Five years ago, Ottoline de Vries quit her job at a law firm in Amsterdam to launch her eponymous design house. \u201cWhile decorating my children\u2019s rooms,\u201d she recalls, \u201cI suddenly found I had so many creative ideas.\u201d De Vries spent her evenings scouring the internet for wallpaper designs to cover vintage finds, such as console tables and chests of drawers. \u201cI guess you could say I became a little pattern-obsessed,\u201d she admits. Eventually, she realised that she was looking for \u201csomething that wasn\u2019t available\u201d and began sketching her own designs. She sent one of them to be printed and when the roll arrived in the post, she realised she had the makings of a new business. The Ottoline aesthetic is inspired by an appreciation for modern art and traditional craft and can be described as both bold and naive. \u201cEveryone has their own way of looking at things,\u201d de Vries concedes, \u201cbut my advice is to go bold in smaller spaces and use a smaller pattern in larger rooms.\u201d De Vries doesn\u2019t recommend wallpapering just one wall in a room. On the contrary, her advice is to paper every surface. \u201cA design becomes much more harmonious and demands less attention if you paper an entire room, including the ceiling.\u201d De Vries, who has become an expert in hanging wallpaper, has tried this herself at home, but admits finding it physically quite a struggle and suggests hiring a decorator for this particular job. The final result is completely enveloping \u2013 like stepping into a gift box. \u201cWhen a room is wrapped in the same pattern, the pieces in it stand out more. It will interest and inspire you without dominating the space.\u201d ottoline.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
