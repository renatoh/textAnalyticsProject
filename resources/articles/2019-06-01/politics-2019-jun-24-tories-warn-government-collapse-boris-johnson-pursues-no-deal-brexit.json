One former Tory minister said he believed there were many more Tory MPs who would be prepared to take that step than those who would publicly admit it. \u201cI do think at least 10 would vote to bring down the government if the government was taking us into no deal,\u201d the MP said. \u201cPoliticians don\u2019t like to admit that they take this view in public, they like to hedge their bets a bit, but that has been my view for a long time.\u201d Tobias Ellwood, the defence minister, said he believed at least a dozen Conservative MPs could be forced into voting against the government. Asked if the Conservatives who felt so strongly against no deal had the numbers, Ellwood told the BBC: \u201cI believe that absolutely is the case. I think a dozen or so members of parliament would be on our side, would be voting against supporting a no deal and that would include ministers as well as backbenchers.\u201d Ellwood later denied he would be among those MPs prepared to vote against the government in a confidence vote. \u201cI simply state the huge long-term dangers of no deal to our economy, security, reputation, the Union and our Party,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI simply forecast there are some who will do all to stop this. Let\u2019s avoid this scenario: leave with a workable deal.\u201d His statement was retweeted by the Conservative MP Antoinette Sandbach, who is among those who has rebelled over giving parliament a meaningful vote on the deal, as well as efforts to halt no deal. The Tory MP Guto Bebb, a backer of the pro-referendum People\u2019s Vote campaign, also said he believed there were enough Conservative MPs prepared to stop no deal. \u201cIf a Conservative leader seriously tried to carry out such a policy, they would face almost certain humiliation in parliament, deepen the sense of crisis and paralysis in the country and widen the divisions inside our party,\u201d he said. \u201cEnough Conservative MPs will put country ahead of party to stop no deal. When that happens we may end up facing an election which no serious Conservative wants.\u201d The former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke, who along with Dominic Grieve has publicly said he would vote against a Conservative government to stop no deal, said: \u201cIf it is heading for a no deal simply because the government has not got around to doing anything then yes I think I would. \u201cI\u2019m a lifelong Conservative, that means I\u2019m pro-business, I\u2019m in favour of free markets, I\u2019m in favour of free trade and I think all those should be combined with a strong social conscience because I\u2019m a one nation Conservative. It might trigger an election, it might trigger a change of government without an election under the law we now have.\u201d Johnson\u2019s opponent, Jeremy Hunt, said the warnings were another reason why he needed to stand up and face scrutiny over how he would avoid such a scenario. \u201cIn that situation, is he [Johnson] going to have an election in order to get a majority in parliament for a no-deal Brexit?\u201d he said. \u201cI think Conservative party members need to know the answer to those questions.\u201d MPs are also understood to be concerned that new recess dates, set to be confirmed on Monday for the week that the new prime minister takes office, would mean no party or coalition would have a chance to form a government if a confidence vote were lost. Under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, parties have up to 14 days to prove they can form an alternative government to command the confidence of the House of Commons. The new prime minister is set to take office either on 22 or 23 July, with parliament set to rise for recess on 24 July. \u201cIn the middle of what might be a major crisis, parliament could be absent because it has agreed to be adjourned,\u201d one MP said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable with that at all.\u201d Pro-second referendum candidates have previously floated the possibility of forming a \u201cunity government\u201d within the 14-day period if a Tory administration lost a confidence vote. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leadership candidate, has said his party would support such an endeavour to form a government with the sole purpose of delivering a new referendum. \u201cLiberal Democrats will do all we can to save the country from a Johnson premiership and to stop Brexit,\u201d he said. \u201cJohnson could very soon find himself without a majority, and I\u2019m working night and day to secure an emergency national government to deliver a people\u2019s vote.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
