Two goals from Massimo Maccarone, the second a superb shot six minutes from time, put the Italians in pole position in Group A and left England needing a win over Portugal tomorrow to guarantee a semi-final place. \"We were beaten by a great finish and a great touch as well,\" Platt said. Platt made two changes from Friday's opening victory over Switzerland - Zat Knight was picked in defence and David Prutton replaced Jermain Defoe - and began with only Peter Crouch up front. But he soon moved Alan Smith forward from midfield. \"I probably messed up the formation,\" Platt admitted. \"We were a bit at sea and we hadn't the platform to build. But we changed it and then we had a foothold in the game. \"I felt quite comfortable in the second half. We equalised and showed the character to come back, and I felt that if anyone was going to go on and win it, it was us.\" Maccarone, the Empoli striker who is being linked with Chelsea, gave England most problems. First he ran on to an exquisite Andrea Pirlo pass, leaving Luke Young trailing, and fired inches past the post. He shot just wide again midway through the half, after Emiliano Bonazzoli cleverly flicked the ball into his path. England's Fulham midfielder Davis, cautioned in the Swiss game, suffered further misery only a minute later when he was booked for a foul and will miss tomorrow's clash against Portugal. Paul Konchesky almost put England in front after 34 minutes when his quickly taken free-kick skimmed through the Italian wall but came back off the post. Italy had another golden opportunity to break the deadlock on 43 minutes when Pirlo's corner fell kindly for Bonazzoli, whose header was cleared off the line by David Dunn. The first half ended in controversy when Knight's header found the corner of the net. The effort was disallowed after the referee Eduardo Gonzalez ruled that the defender held down Cesare Natali when he rose to meet Konchesky's cross. Platt's assistant Steve Wigley was banished from the bench for disputing the decision. Maccarone, who had worked tirelessly throughout, enjoyed the first share of his just rewards when he struck on 58 minutes. The talented striker ran on to another perfect through-ball from Pirlo and went past Chris Riggott before neatly beating Paul Robinson. But England hit back in style, scoring an equaliser six minutes later. Dunn produced a wonderful piece of skill, skipping past three Italian players on the right before crossing to the far post for Gareth Barry, who struck home a sweet left-foot volley. Italy could have regained the lead three minutes later when Vincenzo Iaquinta saw his right-foot drive superbly beaten out by Robinson. But Maccarone could not be denied. He reacted quickest to Natali's long ball over the England defence, cleverly lifting the ball away from Riggott before striking a left-foot half-volley high past Robinson. The niggling between the teams came to a head at an England free-kick in injury-time. Bonera shoved a fist into Davis's face and was sent off. \"If Bonera was sent off, then he had to send Smith off as well,\" Italy's coach Claudio Gentile claimed. \"There were some very good individual performances and I thought some good team play,\" Platt said. \"Sean Davis was exceptional and Alan Smith was a colossus again.\" England (4-4-1-1): Robinson (Leeds); Young (Charlton), Riggott (Derby), Knight (Fulham), Konchesky (Charlton); Prutton (Nottingham Forest; Pennant , Arsenal, 86), Davis (Fulham), Smith (Leeds), Barry (Aston Villa; Zamora , Brighton, 88); Dunn (Blackburn); Crouch (Aston Villa; Defoe , West Ham, h-t).
