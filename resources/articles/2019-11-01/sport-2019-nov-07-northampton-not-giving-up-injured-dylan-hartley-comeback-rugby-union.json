The 33-year-old won 97 caps, the most by any England hooker, and led his country to two Six Nations titles \u2013 one of which was a grand slam\u2013 and a first away series win in Australia having taken over the captaincy following Eddie Jones\u2019s appointment as coach. As the England captain he had an 85% winning record and had hoped to play in the Rugby World Cup this year. The knee injury sustained 11 months ago playing for Northampton ruled out that possibility and has now ended his career. \u201cThe last few months have been difficult mentally and physically as I\u2019ve come to terms with the fact I am no longer able to compete,\u201d said Hartley, who will retire with immediate effect. \u201cI am extremely proud of my journey but now is the right time to hang up my playing boots. \u201cMy career wasn\u2019t perfect but I wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way. I\u2019m privileged to have experienced some amazing highs while there have also been some personal lows, all of which are powerful experiences that will stay with me forever. The final chapter of my career was supposed to go a different way but that is the nature of professional sport.\u201d Hartley, who stands behind only Jason Leonard in terms of England\u2019s most-capped players, made his final appearance for England off the bench in the victory against Australia last November. His career was not without controversy, with the hooker racking up almost two years\u2019 worth of bans for foul play, missing out on the 2013 British &amp; Irish Lions tour of Australia and, indirectly, the 2015 World Cup. Jones, who was criticised for his appointment of Hartley because of his disciplinary record, said England would be \u201cfor ever indebted\u201d to their first captain on the four-year road to last weekend\u2019s World Cup final in Japan. \u201cDylan has had a significant international career playing for his country, and was a tough, enduring character for us,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe owe him a lot for his contribution to the making of this team. We will be for ever indebted to him for his dedication and commitment to the team and his love of English rugby.\u2019 At Northampton, Hartley captained the club for eight years, and made 251 appearances, his final match coming against Worcester at Sixways on 21 December last year. Hartley said. \u201cI came to England as a teenager hoping to get a few games and to see the world. I could have never predicted that one day I\u2019d play 14 years for such a special club and go on to represent and captain England. \u201cNorthampton has been more than just a club to me. It has been a place that has provided me with direction, purpose, a sense of family, home and belonging, and ultimately a community I was so proud to represent.\u201d His retirement has been in the offing but Hartley continued to train up until Tuesday and has been advising Northampton\u2019s two current captains Alex Waller and Teimana Harrison as well as mentoring the club\u2019s hookers. Former teammates for England and Northampton followed Jones in paying tribute. \u201cSo much will be said about all his achievements and status within the game ... and rightly so,\u201d said Tom Wood, who played alongside Hartley for club and country. \u201cI\u2019m just sad to see another of my mates have to step away from the field. I know you\u2019ll land on your feet whatever route you choose to take.\u201d Will Hooley, the USA full-back who began his career at Northampton, said: \u201cSimply one of the best leaders. From the academy to the first team he gave his time to the youngest. Pleasure to have played alongside you. A cruel way for it all to end.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
