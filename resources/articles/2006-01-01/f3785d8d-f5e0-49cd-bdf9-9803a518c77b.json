Anxious London council leaders fear the mayor's proposed budget will affect their chances in this year's local elections. The mayor's proposed budget for the year beginning April 2006 is \u00a32.9bn - equivalent to a 16.7% rise to the charge levied on London council tax payers, which would bring the mayor's precept on the average band D bill to \u00a3297. This figure includes the first year of the extra payments Londoners will make towards the 2012 Olympics, which will add \u00a320 to the average bill. Merrick Cockell, Kensington and Chelsea's Tory leader, voiced the concern of many London council leaders over the increase on council tax proposed by Mr Livingstone at a London assembly budget committee today. Council leaders are nervous because the budget increase set by the mayor is funded by a precept levied on the council tax, which local authorities bill to residents. Mr Cockell said he hoped Mr Livingstone would be bound by the same tough capping rules applied by government to councils, which received a letter before Christmas reiterating that increases of 5% or more would be capped. \"Assuming there is not going to be one rule for the Greater London authority and another for the rest of local government ... if you go anywhere near 5% I assume it will be capped,\" he said. \"The rest of us are in an election period so we would be mad to increase [our council tax] anything near 5%. My intention is not to do that in my authority. \"This is not the year for the mayor to stay at the level he is talking about here.\" It was \"really time\" to revisit the whole way the GLA budget is explained and its impact on council tax so residents did not blame councils for excessive increases, he added. Just before Christmas, Mr Livingstone unveiled his budgetary plans for the Greater London authority, which include dedicated policing for every community in London by March 2007 by expanding the safer neighbourhood teams scheme. The mayor also costed into his budget additional funding to protect London against future terrorist attacks and extra transport financing to continue the improvements in London's transport network. Lambeth Liberal Democrat councilllor Ashley Lumsden, who is deputy chairman of the Association of London Government's grants committee, said his council was considering sending out information to residents detailing the make up of the council tax, and highlighting which of the billing authorities were making efforts to find efficiencies. This would avoid residents pinning the blame on the local authority for precept levels set by the GLA and other bodies, such as police and fire authorities. Mr Lumsden criticized the mayor's failure to lay out in his draft budget how he planned to achieve value for money for tax payers. While councils were bound to make 2.5% of efficiency savings for each of the next three years, the mayor's budget failed to stipulate how he planned to save money. \"What we cannot tell from these papers is whether or not there has been clear direction from the mayor as to the savings he expects to see this year or where they will come from,\" Mr Lumsden said. \"Instead, we have some general ideas around savings and efficiencies.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
