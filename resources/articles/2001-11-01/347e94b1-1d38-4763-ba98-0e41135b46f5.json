Bayern Munich secured their ninth straight league win with a 3-0 victory over Hamburg at the Olympic Stadium. Bayern were made to work hard for their victory, not breaking the Hamburg defence until the 68th minute when an Owen Hargreaves free-kick was glanced in by Paulo Sergio. Once Sergio had opened the scoring Claudio Pizarro added a late brace that included a rocket of a free-kick past the Hamburg keeper. \"When I took the free-kick I saw that the keeper was in the centre of the goal so I aimed for the top corner,\" he said. Fabien had better watch his top-corners. Bayern manager Ottmar Hitzfeld admitted: \"We had to work very hard for this victory and I am happy with the teams performance.\" Speaking last week after his side were again drawn against Manchester United in the Champions League Hitzfeld said, \"I would expect Manchester United and ourselves to progress to the quarter-finals.\" The German manager is expressing a little more faith in United at present than Sir Alex can muster from his team's recent performances in the Premiership. Elsewhere this weekend, and in contrast to the Premiership's array of suprising results, no lower placed team managed to inflict defeat on a side currently placed higher than themselves. Second-placed Leverkusen came from behind to beat Kaiserslautern thanks to two goals from Michael Ballack, ensuring the Rhineland club keep up the pressure on Bayern. On 34 minutes, referee Florian Meyer pointed to the penalty spot following a foul by Harry Koch on Ulf Kirsten. Ballack slotted home coolly to the bottom-right of Georg Koch's goal for the equaliser after Luxemberg international Jeff Strasser had given Kaiserslautern the lead. The second half was one-way traffic towards Koch's goal, as the home side found an extra gear and cruised to victory. Matthias Sammer's Dortmund climbed to third place, following his side's narrow 1-0 victory over Stuttgart. Lars Ricken scored the only goal of a dull game in the 51st minute. A capacity 60,204 crowd at the Gelsenkirchen Arena saw Schalke put their exit from the Champions League behind them by taking three points in an entertaining 3 - 1 defeat of lowly placed Cologne. Referee Lutz Wagner made some dubious decisions and sent off Cologne's Matthias Scherz in the 32nd minute for a second bookable offence. Possessed by a fighting spirit it was Cologne who scored first, only for Ebbe Sand to equalise in the very last minute of the first half. Andreas Moller and Sand's second wrapped up victory for Schalke with the goals in the second half. Bayern-bound Sebastian Deisler was absent from the Hertha Berlin side that sealed their fifth win in a row as the capital club ran out 3-0 winners over M\u00f6nchengladbach and put themselves within touching distance of a Uefa cup spot. Brazilian Marcelinho slotted home Hertha's first, Dick van Burik followed up with the second and Michael Preetz scored the third - the 300th goal scored in the Bundesliga this season. At the wrong end of the table Wolfsburg ran riot and put five goals past bottom-placed Nuremberg to secure themselves a much needed three points. Bremen's 1-0 victory in Rostock came courtesy of home keeper Mathias Schober deflecting an Ivan Klasnic shot into his own net on 74 minutes. The three points lifted Bremen above Stuttgart in the table and leaves Rostock hovering around the relegation zone. Cottbus are suffering something of a crisis having now suffered six successive defeats after going down 3-1 in Freiburg. Freiburg's Sebastian Kehl was sent off for elbowing Vasile Miriuta on the half hour, but Cottbus failed to take advantage and promptly went a goal behind when Isachwali scored. Cottbus equalised before the break, but Freiburg dug deep, swarming their visitors and scoring two more goals on their way towards a well-deserved win. Their victory keeps Freiburg in the top half of the table and leaves Cottbus precariously placed just one spot above the relegation zone. Le Championnat In France ten-man Lille slumped to their first defeat in six months, going down 4-2 at Lyon. The home side took the lead when Sidney Govou volleyed home in the 28th minute, but Lille reacted immediately, forcing Jeremie Brechet to head into his own net. Lille, the last unbeaten team in the top flight this season, had defender Sylvain N'Diaye sent off after 42 minutes for a second bookable offence and in the second half they capitulated, Govou and Philippe Violeau sealing Lyon's victory. Jonathan Jager grabbed two goals for Metz as they recorded a comfortable 2-0 victory over the early pacesetters Auxerre, who slip to fourth after going down to their second defeat of the season. Patrice Loko struck against his former side as Troyes overcame their Uefa Cup defeat against Leeds United on Thursday with a 1-0 victory over Paris Saint-Germain. It's not just in the Premiership that manager's are feeling the pressure early on in the season. Marseille coach Tomislav Ivic has admitted that he would have been sacked had his struggling side not beaten Rennes on Saturday. \"Maybe I will be given an extra two weeks now,\" he said. Marseille's 2-1 win at the Stade Velodrome, only their second win of the season, promises to offer Ivic a little respite. Former Chelsea defender Frank Le Boeuf converted a penalty with six minutes to go after Brazilian Fernando had opened the scoring in the first half. \"The win will give us 14 days of tranquility,\" said Ivic. Nantes are in the unusual position of being bottom of their domestic league after having won their opening Champions League group. They started the week by clinching just their second league win of the season against Sochaux, before beating Italian giants Lazio, and continued this rich vein of form by seeing off fellow strugglers Monaco 2-1 securing their third win in seven days. \"It has been a good week, but it was important to finish it off with a win,\" said Nantes coach Raynauld Denoueix. Second frm bottom Sedan boosted their points tally with a 2-0 win against relegation rivals Montpellier, while Guingamp were held to a goalless draw at home by Sochaux."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
