All the indications are that Hull\u2019s ground will be barely half full, with a crowd of around 13,000 expected for a tie which both sides arguably could do without as they strive to, respectively, remain in the Premier League and return to it. \u201cI\u2019d like to see as many of our fans as possible,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez, whose Newcastle players are endeavouring to reach a first domestic semi-final since 2005 while also keeping their Championship promotion campaign on track. \u201cI\u2019m not liking Hull\u2019s policy, I can\u2019t control what they decide but it\u2019s a pity, not only for our fans but for football in general. \u201cWhy would you have empty stadiums when you could fill them with people who would enjoy themselves? The good thing is it\u2019s not normal here but in Spain you see stadiums half empty and in Italy sometimes they\u2019re only 20% occupied.\u201d Newcastle\u2019s manager is particularly impressed that several thousand Tynesiders were prepared to make a six-hour, 300-mile round trip to East Yorkshire on a winter\u2019s night at a time when the sheer amount of live matches on television presents a potential threat to attendances. \u201cWith so much football on TV, it would have been giving more fans an opportunity to see a game live,\u201d Ben\u00edtez said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity because football needs to be more about the people who go to games rather than about TV. I always like to see stadiums full because, ultimately, football is for the fans. Its future is about children and families going to games.\u201d Given the growing local disgruntlement with the failure of Hull\u2019s owners, the Allam family, to furnish Mike Phelan with a squad properly equipped for Premier League combat, the ambience may not be entirely family friendly. The sort of dissension in the stands expected, once again, on Tuesday night partly explains why Newcastle\u2019s Mohamed Diam\u00e9 and Isaac Hayden were happy to depart Humberside after helping the side, then managed by Steve Bruce, win promotion last May. Ben\u00edtez, meanwhile, must juggle his desire to succeed where countless predecessors have failed and collect some long elusive silverware, with the imperative to keep Newcastle on top of the Championship. \u201cWe\u2019ll make changes,\u201d said the second tier\u2019s most enthusiastic rotator. \u201cIf we go through I\u2019ll be pleased but, if we don\u2019t, I\u2019ll say we weren\u2019t strong enough to compete in two competitions at maximum level. \u201cI\u2019ll play the team which, in my opinion, can do the job \u2013 without taking any risks by pushing individual players too hard and risking injuries. Risking one or two players being out for maybe a month makes no sense.\u201d Should a two-legged semi final in January beckon, ambition must continue to be leavened by pragmatism. \u201cIf we\u2019ve progressed and I have to take a risk with one player [over fitness] because he can help us be in the final and maybe win the final, I\u2019ll do it if I can,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez. \u201cIt depends where we are in the League in January - but if we have a chance to win a trophy, I\u2019ll try to win a trophy. That\u2019s 100 per cent sure.\u201d Despite his often strained relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson, Phelan\u2019s old boss at Manchester United, Ben\u00edtez feels no animosity towards Hull\u2019s manager. \u201cI have a lot of respect for him,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s doing a great job, despite recent results, they\u2019re playing good football.\u201d While Newcastle have one eye on the League trip to Nottingham Forest on Friday, Hull visit relegation rivals Middlesbrough on Monday night, leaving both managers with broadly similar dilemmas. \u201cMy players all want to go as far as they possibly can,\u201d Phelan said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be giving it everything.\u201d Which does not preclude a little rotation of his own. \u201cWe\u2019ve got three or four players that haven\u2019t been involved up to now and we need to get them out on the grass, so we\u2019ll be using them. There\u2019ll be changes but we should still be in reasonably good shape. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what team Rafa plays.\u201d The Newcastle midfielder Jack Colback, meanwhile, has been fined \u00a325,000 after admitting a Football Association misconduct charge for betting. Colback was charged with a breach of regulations introduced in 2014 which prevent players and coaches from placing bets on any football activity worldwide. A club statement said: \u201cJack Colback has been fined 25,000 after he accepted an FA misconduct charge in relation to betting. The Newcastle player breached FA Rule E8 in respect of a bet placed on the result, progress, conduct or any other aspect of, or occurrence in, a football match or competition on 16 March 2016.\u201d Colback\u2019s offence came two days after Newcastle lost 1-0 at Leicester City and four days before they drew 1-1 with his former club Sunderland as they fought desperately \u2013 and ultimately unsuccessfully \u2013 to remain in the Premier League."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
