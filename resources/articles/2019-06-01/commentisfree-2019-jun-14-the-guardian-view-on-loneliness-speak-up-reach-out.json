This is not an idea that would appeal to those who commute in the rush hour. The question of whether to talk to strangers is dependent on many things, but one of them is simple physical proximity. It\u2019s obvious that we will not talk to strangers who are physically too far away. No one wants to shout their small talk. Perhaps less obvious, but just as important, is that there is a smaller distance within which it\u2019s just as uncomfortable to talk. No one wants to exchange pleasantries with the stranger in whose armpit they nestle in a packed carriage. It is no coincidence that the first truly personal music player, the Sony Walkman, was invented in the country where the commuter trains are literally crammed with people, by workers employed for that purpose. Even on aeroplanes, the seats in economy class are too close to one another to promote friendly feeling. Elbow room is a precondition for sociability. Only on country buses or similar unhurried and unsquashed forms of public transport can people reach out to their neighbours, confident that they are doing so from a position of strength and autonomy. For all these drawbacks, the idea of talking to strangers is still a good one, and the promotion of sociability is good for society. Although it does seem to be a general rule that people are friendlier the fewer there are of them and more hostile and indifferent as cities get more crowded, there are still considerable cultural variations; and there is evidence that friendlier places are also healthier, and their inhabitants happier. It is true that the apparent loneliness of many people on public transport is an illusion. Many will be caught up with conversations with distant friends on their phones; some will be talking to the people in books. Some may be in willed solitude with their headphones. But there are always people who would be interested in an unexpected conversation with a stranger. This need not go on for too long. Knowing when to let the other party retreat is an important social skill. But sometimes there is no natural moment of withdrawal. The conversations that spring up between strangers on long journeys can sometimes be curiously intimate and liberating. The knowledge that you will never need to speak to someone again promotes honesty and a freedom of confession that is hard to discover elsewhere. Such large and possibly life-changing conversations are not, though, what most people in loneliness miss most. They can consider the great themes of their lives very easily. Quite possibly they feel they cannot get away from them. Their thoughts trudge onwards in the stony ruts of depression, round and round without sanctuary or escape. What they really need is not deep thought but superficiality. The kind of conversation that you could have with anyone reminds you that you might yourself be anyone. It is a release from the prison of the self, which is where lonely people serve their sentences, uncertain whether they ever can be paroled. Friendship may be too rare a gift to hope for, but sometimes the kindest thing to say is also the simplest: \u201cDon\u2019t be a stranger\u201d \u2013 and sometimes that\u2019s also enough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
