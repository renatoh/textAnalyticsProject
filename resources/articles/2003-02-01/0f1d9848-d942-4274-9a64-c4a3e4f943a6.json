It may not sound like an appealing location - just 15 minutes from Athens Eleftherios Venizelos airport - but since the site isn't listed in any guidebook, it remains the city's secret escape. For years, one of my best chums Argy Kakssis has been inviting me to her stakeout, where she and Yiorgos have unfailingly spent every summer weekend since 1996. Despite the envy I suffer when she returns on a Monday even more bronzed than the average goddess, the bald truth was I couldn't face camping. Give me a luxury bungalow on the beach any day. One blisteringly hot weekend, I caved in. Like a sissy, I booked into the nearest hotel - the revamped Club Med located at Vavrona. This way, I could spend all day swimming and sipping cold coffees with Argy and her pals, then nip back for some pampering at the Club Med spa. On the Saturday morning I enjoyed a leisurely breakfast on the hotel terrace. But something was wrong. Searing temperatures had turned my room into an oven. The air conditioning had been difficult to work out in the middle of the night, so I had a thumping headache. There was no water or mini bar so I had been forced to guzzle mouthfuls of tepid tap water. My phone didn't work because of a check-in technicality so room service was out of the question. What's more, that elusive sense of freedom you hanker for on a weekend was wiped out by an over-zealous security checkpoint hotel. Argy had trouble getting in the gates - and we had trouble persuading them to let us out. Free at last, we zoomed off to her camping spot at Hamolia. Once past the ugly sprawl of buildings at Loutsa, the landscape turns into undulating hills overlooking a mixture of sandy and rocky coves. Hamolia is at the end of a road that ends on a deserted pine-covered peninsula, a one-time army training ground. Genuine khaki tents remain on their own parapet (no fiddling around with pegs or soggy grass), a frisbee-throw away from two shallow coves offering perfect swimming and snorkelling. There's also a mini settlement of whitewashed bungalows that look cosy enough to live in. A kind of 1950's holiday camp atmosphere prevails. \"My aunts and uncles have been coming here all their lives\" laughs Argy. Being the domestic queen that she is, Argy has rather charmingly kitted their tent's interior like a home from home, with every comfort imaginable. Small mirrors dangle from overhanging branches. Laundry supplies are tucked away in hanging storage bins. Floors are covered in lino and bright rugs. Finally, Hamolia's M.A.S.H.-style outdoor showers provide that last post-beach delight of sluicing off sand and salt. Every Sunday night, all the gear is shifted back inside the tent (no fear of pilfering here) behind the flaps until the following Friday. All day we sunbaked on the rocks. Snorkelled a little around the bay. Watched people play volleyball in the heat. When we got peckish the outdoor taverna rustled up a mean souvlaki for the price of a tube ticket. Nipped in an out of the cafe for cold beer. By late afternoon quite a few bottles cluttered the table, I got drowsy and decided it was time to siesta. Luckily the tents are two bedded, walk in affairs with an al-fresco \"terrace\". Unlike most campgrounds, the only noise I could hear was birdsong. I lay down gazing at the Aegean and the island of Evia in the distance and nodded off into a divine sleep. Later on, it was back to the beach bar. After dark it morphs into a nightclub and the 'parea' (or gang) return after siestas. \"It stays open as long as I can stay awake, DJ and serve drinks,\" says Yiorgos. The evening ended sometime after sunrise. Enviably, Argy and George get to do what tourists dream about when the beach is too busy. Hop in their speedboat (moored at the site) and visit nearby Tzia, a rather exclusive island wealthy Athenians prefer to slope off to. I'm now eyeing up that empty tent next door. Next summer, maybe. Way to go Hamolia Enquire locally for week-long stays.

Paliouri, on the Sithonia (middle) peninsula. (00 302 3740 92206) Sparsely populated, Halkidiki is a lush forested three fingered prong jutting into the north Aegean Sea.
