In a submission to the joint standing committee on electoral matters, which is holding an inquiry into election funding and disclosure, GetUp says the government\u2019s bill contains an extraordinary requirement for not-for-profit organisations to obtain a statutory declaration from donors who give just $4.80 a week to political campaign organisations such as GetUp. It says according to Sections 302L and 302P of the bill\u2019s explanatory memorandum, buried on pages 43 and 45, the government makes it clear that if individuals want to donate $250 or more annually to an organisation they will have to declare they are an \u201callowable donor\u201d and have a justice of the peace or a police officer witness their declaration. GetUp says that would require organisations to monitor cumulative small donations in real time and, once the annual $250 ceiling is met, to refuse further donations until a statutory declaration is obtained. Failure to comply with the law would result in 10 years\u2019 imprisonment or a fine of $210,000. \u201cThis hidden clause reveals the federal government\u2019s true intention is to shut down anyone it doesn\u2019t agree with,\u201d Paul Oosting, GetUp national director, told Guardian Australia. \u201cThis will destroy grassroots groups\u2019 and minor parties\u2019 revenue streams. \u201cIf brought into law, this would starve GetUp of more than half of our people-powered funding, essentially halting our ability to call on the government to save the Great Barrier Reef, demand corporations contribute a fair share to our local schools and hospitals and treat people seeking asylum in Australia humanely. \u201cYou can get a passport or buy a house without a stat dec but now if you want to stand up for a cause you believe in you\u2019ve got to line up at a police station and get a formal document signed and witnessed. It\u2019s absurd. \u201cThis bill serves the interests of the Turnbull government and no one else. It doesn\u2019t stop the likes of Gina Rinehart or the Adani Corporation from cutting huge cheques to their favourite politicians but it forces everyday people to jump through absurd hoops just to have their say in our democracy.\u201d GetUp\u2019s submission says the government\u2019s bill is ostensibly a response to a series of scandals surrounding foreign funding of politicians and political parties, and the potential for undue foreign influence, but those scandals would not have played out any differently if the bill were enacted into law. \u201cThe \u2018foreign donors; namechecked in the media \u2013 Chau Chak Wing and Huang Xiang Mo \u2013 both hold or held Australian citizenship or residency at the time the donations were made and therefore would be allowable donors under the provisions of the bill,\u201d GetUp\u2019s submission says. \u201cMeanwhile, the bill not only prohibits many not-for-profits from receiving international philanthropy entirely, but imposes a large administrative burden for them to confirm the identity of all donors \u2013 as opposed to, for example, simply determining whether the donation came from a foreign bank account. \u201cThis represents a near-impossible feat for community organisations that depend on the small donations of thousands of everyday people. \u201cThere is also a reasonable concern that banning donations by reference to a person\u2019s identity in the way currently drafted is unconstitutional. It is clear the Bill is not serving the interests of the Australian public, concerned about the recent slew of foreign donations scandals \u2013 which raises the question, what or whose interests does it serve? \u201cOne clue is in what the bill omits. It misses by far the biggest risk for \u2018foreign influence\u2019 in Australia\u2019s democracy: large multinational corporations.\u201d The Minerals Council of Australia, one of Australia\u2019s biggest corporate lobby groups, has conceded that it makes political donations and pays to attend fundraisers to gain access to members of parliament. In a submission to a separate Senate inquiry, the MCA said it made donations amounting to $33,250 in 2015-16 and $57,345 in 2016-17, which were declared to the Australian Electoral Commission. The majority in both years went to the Liberal or National parties and associated entities. The frank admission \u2013 which reflects a commonly held belief about the role of money in politics \u2013 stuck out because major corporations and lobby groups by and large say they make donations to support democracy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
