The City manager took full responsibility as Andy Carroll scored the first two goals of his Liverpool career since his \u00a335m move from Newcastle United, yet afterwards the Italian guaranteed to lead the club into next season's Champions League and into the FA Cup Final at United's expense. He also admitted Mario Balotelli, Tevez's replacement, was substituted in response to the Italian forward's meagre contribution. \"I am disappointed with myself because I made a mistake. It was my fault \u2013 not the players,\" said Mancini, whose side, in fourth place, are without an away win in 2011 and only three points clear of Tottenham Hotspur having played a game more. \"The players played 100 per cent. It is important that I understand that it was my mistake. I made a mistake in the last two days but I know why. But I don't want to say any more than that.\" City arrived at Anfield shortly before 7pm for an 8pm kick off and, while refusing to pin-point his mistake, Mancini indicated his preparations had encouraged the visitors to treat Liverpool too lightly. The Italian added: \"I think Liverpool played fantastic in the first 20 minutes. We left a lot of space for them and they were very aggressive while we played very soft. I made three changes to bring in three fresh players but our focus was not good. After 20 minutes we started to play but it was too late. For this I think it is my fault. It is very difficult for me. \"We did not prepare for this game very well. The fact we arrived late was probably part of the reason. We probably thought that if we played this game less than 100 per cent we could still get a win. But football is not like that. I have learned something about myself. I have a lot of experience so it was my mistake not the players. I am sure we will get in the Champions League and we will get to the final.\" Tevez was injured in the build-up to Carroll's emphatic opening goal and has little chance of featuring at Wembley in five days' time. \"Carlos has a hamstring and it will be very difficult for him to play in the semi-final. I don't think he will play,\" said Mancini. \"We will try to recover him but it is very difficult and we have to think of the final six games of the season to get a Champions League place.\" Kenny Dalglish, meanwhile, credited the blossoming partnership of Carroll and Luis Su\u00e1rez, plus a superb debut from 18-year-old right-back John Flanagan, as key factors in Liverpool's commanding victory. \"It was great to see Andy get off the mark,\" he said. \"His first was a fantastic strike and his second was a good header. You can see that the more Andy and Luis Suarez play together, the better they understand each other. Luis was unlucky not to open the scoring when he hit the post.It was an excellent performance all round. \"We have scored three and played well. We give a young boy at 18 his debut and he was outstanding, we have not lost any goals so there is not much wrong with this evening's work.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
