The Good Pub Guide 2019 said pretentious and inaccessible menus were a turn-off for pub-goers. The 37th edition of the guide, published on Thursday, features more than 5,000 pubs on the basis of people\u2019s recommendations, backed up by editor visits and inspections. In addition to official reviews there are online listings for another 40,000 pubs across the UK. Contributors generally welcomed the rise in culinary standards over the past decade, which in many cases saved pubs from closure, but feared it could have backfired, with overambitious menus featuring unrecognisable ingredients. The guide said: \u201cPubs and good food now go hand in hand, but many chefs appear to have gone Masterchef-mad. We really aren\u2019t interested in eating kabsa, katsuobushi, matbucha, succotash, tataki or verjus in a pub. We don\u2019t want our dishes adorned with carrot fluff, edible sand or fish \u2018foam\u2019. Leave that to the swanky restaurants. We want good, honest pub grub.\u201d Picking up the award for value pub of the year is the Old Castle in Bridgnorth, Shropshire. In 12 years as landlord, Bryn Masterman has built up a reputation for homemade classics such as fish pie, steak pie and roasted lamb shank. \u201cWe pride ourselves on our range of hearty, homemade, food made from quality local ingredients,\u201d Masterman said. \u201cProbably the bravest thing we did was to serve real horse steaks just after the horsemeat scandal. Our customers really enjoyed them.\u201d Fiona Stapley, the guide\u2019s editor, said: \u201cIn the 37 years of the Good Pub Guide\u2019s existence, fancy food fads have come and gone, but what always stands fast is honest cooking using tip-top local, seasonal, ingredients, but ones that we can all recognise.\u201d The proliferation of pretentious menus is not confined to pubs, however. The Good Food Guide 2019, which lists the UK\u2019s top 50 restaurants, said many such eateries were \u201cstill baffling us with incomprehensible menus\u201d. Elizabeth Carter, consultant editor of the Good Food Guide, said she was no fan of \u201cpretentious lists of ingredients devoid of prepositions, participles or conjunctions that you have to ask waiting staff to explain, for \u2018beef, sprouts, coffee\u2019 only invites puzzlement and a battalion of questions. After all, it\u2019s the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary.\u201d The guide awarded top spot to the Cornish seafood restaurant Nathan Outlaw for the second year running, after it notched up a perfect cooking score of 10 for the third year in a row. Clare Smyth's West London restaurant Core entered the top 10 at number three \u2013 the highest new entry in the guide\u2019s history \u2013 and received a score of 10, behind Simon Rogan's L'Enclume in Cumbria. Elsewhere in the Good Pub Guide, a village pub \u2013 The Cock in Hemingford Grey, Cambridgeshire \u2013which sells real ale and 20 different wines, with a \u201cbustling\u201d atmosphere, has been named pub of the year for the second time. The pub also sells local cider, has a bar just for drinkers, wood-burning stoves and a busy separate restaurant. The pub guide also crowned its first gin pub of the year, The Cholmondeley Arms, in Cheshire, which stocks 365 different gins."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
