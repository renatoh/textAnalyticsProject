Speaking before the first tranche of top appointments, the new Labour leader promised he would create a shadow cabinet balanced between the various wings of the party. However, MPs still loyal to Jeremy Corbyn will note there was no immediate role for Rebecca Long-Bailey, the former leader\u2019s perceived favourite in the leadership race, and no senior job yet for other figures associated with his camp. Starmer\u2019s top team was completed by Nick Thomas-Symonds, a barrister, who takes over from Diane Abbott as shadow home secretary. Thomas-Symonds, the MP for the Welsh seat of Torfaen since 2015, was previously a security minister in the shadow home affairs team. Dodds, the Oxford East MP, is a former MEP and has spent nearly three years as a shadow Treasury minister. Among the other appointments, Angela Rayner, the newly elected deputy leader, was also made the Labour party chair. There was a return to the shadow cabinet for Rachel Reeves, the Leeds West MP who was shadow work and pensions minister under Ed Miliband but who spent the entire Corbyn period on the backbenches. She was made shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Jonathan Ashworth remains in the health brief, as was widely expected given the coronavirus pandemic, with Nick Brown staying as chief whip and Angela Smith as shadow Lords leader. Barry Gardiner, Jon Trickett and Ian Lavery were confirmed as having left the shadow cabinet, having served as shadow international trade secretary, shadow Cabinet Office minister and party chair respectively. Trickett tweeted to say Starmer had \u201cpolitely asked me to stand down\u201d. Emily Thornberry, previously shadow foreign secretary, will stay in the shadow cabinet in a new position to be announced on Monday. Nandy\u2019s elevation was the one surprise amid the most senior appointments, with a series of newspapers having tipped the Cardiff MP Jo Stevens as being lined up for the post. While Nandy, the MP for Wigan since 2010, came a third in the leadership race, she emerged during the campaign as a leading voice in promoting Labour efforts to reconnect with voters in struggling towns in the north and Midlands. Nandy\u2019s mantra during the campaign was that Labour must \u201cchange or die\u201d. On foreign affairs she was critical of what she said was the disinclination of Corbyn and his team to criticise Russia, and she called for a more positive defence of international values. In a tweet following the news, Nandy wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s a real honour to be tasked with leading Labour\u2019s foreign policy response in these difficult times.\u201d Starmer said that under his leadership the priority would be to \u201cact in the country\u2019s interest to save lives and protect livelihoods\u201d during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cWe will be a responsible opposition that supports the government where we believe they are right and challenge them when we believe mistakes are being made,\u201d he said. Asked about his plans earlier in the day, Starmer told BBC One\u2019s Andrew Marr Show that his shadow cabinet would be \u201cbalanced across the party, it will be balanced across the country \u2013 and of course it will be balanced in terms of diversity\u201d. Asked if he would include some Blairites in his frontbench team, Starmer said he wanted to move on from such labels. \u201cI will have in my shadow cabinet those that want to serve towards the future aim of winning that next general election. It\u2019ll be a talented, balanced shadow cabinet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking back, we\u2019re not badging people by the past. We\u2019re going forward to the future, focusing on how we win the 2024 general election.\u201d In his first media interview since winning the leadership, Starmer sought to stress party unity but made it plain he believed that Labour needed significant change. \u201cWe just lost four elections in a row and therefore of course we need to change. If we don\u2019t change we will lose the next general election.\u201d Playing down the idea of some form of national unity government, Starmer pledged to work constructively with the government over the response to coronavirus while asking \u201cdifficult questions\u201d when needed. But he stressed the need for an equitable economic settlement once the crisis was over, saying there would be a need for richer people and corporations to pay more tax, rather than a return to austerity. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is go back to business as usual,\u201d he said. \u201cWe now know who the key workers really are, and they very often have been overlooked and underpaid, and there has got to be a change. They were last and now they\u2019ve got to be first.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
