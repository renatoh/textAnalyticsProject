But fear not. Fox News' Glenn Beck has a plan. In a segment called War Room that aired late last month, the presenter sought to prepare his dear viewers for the worst so they can \"think outside of the box\". Beck said his intention was not the audience. Rather, he - and his panel of experts - was simply pointing out how easy it will be for unimaginable disaster to unfold before our very eyes. Panelist Gerald Celente predicted New York would turn into Mexico City and major US cities would be forced to cope with homeless people, hookers, pick-pockets and pan handlers. Um, Gerald, don't big cities already have these problems? But I digress. Although some may say War Room stoked fears that Barack Obama's presidency will lead to the end of civilisation as we know it, others may find comfort knowing that Fox News has showed us how to navigate a path that could have been avoided if we had only voted Republican. Thank you, Glenn Beck. Thank you."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
