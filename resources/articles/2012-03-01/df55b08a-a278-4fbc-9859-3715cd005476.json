Attack their scrum The scrum is definitely an area where we have improved. As a wing I don't know much about scrums but I have spoken to Gethin [Jenkins] and Adam [Jones] about this and they say that the French scrum has always been one of the strongest that they face. I think the tables have turned, though, and from a position where we were once put under pressure by France I now think Wales will look to attack this area at the Millennium Stadium. The Welsh scrum has been putting other teams under pressure and, while the whole area seems to be a minefield at the moment, a good scrum gives the Welsh backs a great platform to play off. When you look at the number of penalties that have been awarded as a result of scrum infringements, it's an easy three points if you can dominate this area. 2. Change the point of attack We have got to move France around the park. Against Italy Wales kept trying to get through the inside 10 channel and didn't find any gains there. We have got to set more targets in midfield in the 13 channel. I would certainly send the likes of Jamie [Roberts], George [North] and Jonathan [Davies] into the 12-13 channel and be very aggressive and then work their forwards round the corner. If we attack too narrowly off the French scrum or lineout and bring their back row into the game, then we will make problems for ourselves. If we move France around the park and play at a high tempo we will nullify Thierry Dusautoir. 3. Dictate the tempo Following on from point two, if we play at a high tempo I believe we are fitter then the French side. The problem with playing France is that they can look lethargic, as they have at times in this tournament, and then change in a second. If they think they have a sniff of a score, they're deadly. Wales have to play at tempo and dictate the way they want to play the game rather than letting France slow it down and then suddenly raise the pace of play. One decision I don't understand from Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 is bringing Florian Fritz into midfield, moving Welsey Fofana to one wing and dropping Julien Malzieu from the other. I've felt that Malzieu has been one of the best French backs in the tournament. 4. Nullify their back row France will look to take Wales head on. We need to look after the ball at the breakdown. They will see that Wales have one of the best back rows but [Julien] Bonnaire, Dusautoir and [Imanol] Harinordoquy are very good themselves. It will be a crucial battle. They will be hoping that Wales are going to make mistakes but I just can't see them doing that. However, Wales definitely need to improve in the tackle area compared with last week against the Italians. To be fair Italy did a lot of defending and did it very well. They did to Wales what Dan Lydiate has been very good at doing to Wales's opposition, sending a man in straight after the tackle to turn the ball over. Against Italy Wales turned over a lot of ball in the opposition 22 in that way and, having watched the game back, Warren Gatland will have seen it as an area to brush up on. Dusautoir is the best in the game at that and gets a lot of turnovers. 5. Don't change our game plan Wales must stick to their patterns and game structure. They don't want to go out and start throwing the ball around against France, which is what we have done at times in the past and come unstuck. We have made mistakes and France have capitalised. In the games we have won in this Six Nations we have defended very well and pressurised teams into mistakes. We have to do the same to France and, when we have got the ball, we need to go through our phases and stay patient. Tries we have conceded over a number of years have come from turnovers or interceptions. They need to grind out a win and hopefully do enough to open up the game in the last 10-15 minutes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
