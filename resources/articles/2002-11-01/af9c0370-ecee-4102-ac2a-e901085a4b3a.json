Bath were ugly to watch for the most part, but the hooker Jonathan Humphreys led by example in the way he hounded, hustled and harried. His body took a beating and he needed lengthy treatment on three occasions. Sale had more class, but they panicked under pressure and needed a stoppage-time penalty to garner a bonus point. Bath trailed 15-8 at the break, agents of their own misfortune, and conceded soft tries at the beginning and end of the first half. They had not won at home in the Premiership this season while Sale were looking for their first victory on the road. Both sides were below strength because of injuries and international call-ups, but the visitors showed a confidence with the ball in hand which Bath badly lacked, and even Mike Catt, usually a steadying influence at outside-half, was clearly troubled by the pelvic injury which has blighted his season. Catt lasted 57 minutes and may need a long rest. \"Mike will play for us in the next couple of matches but, if the injury is still troubling him when our international players return, we will have to give him some time off,\" said Bath's coach Michael Foley. \"He was hardly able to train last week but his attitude in wanting to play typifies the guts the players are showing.\" Bath were most impressive when the replacement half- backs Andy Williams and Chris Malone took control in the final quarter. Sale tried to protect their lead rather than build on it. With Bath not looking likely to break their defence, Sale became over-confident and, when the full-back Vaughan Going's ambitious pass near the halfway line went astray, the wing Simon Danielli hacked the ball towards the Sale line only to be tackled before he had secured possession by the debutant outside-half Warren Spragg. The resulting penalty try put Bath in the lead and Barkley's third penalty and Malone's late drop-goal sealed victory.
