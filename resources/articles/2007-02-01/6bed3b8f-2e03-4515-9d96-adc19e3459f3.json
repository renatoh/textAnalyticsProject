Vodafone is competing with at least three other bidders for a controlling stake of India's fourth largest mobile phone company, Hutchison Essar. Stiff competition for the Mumbai-based operator has prompted concern among industry experts that the eventual buyer could pay too much for the 67% stake, which has been put up for sale by Hutchison International, based in Hong Kong. Valuations have risen as high as $20bn (\u00a310.3bn) in recent weeks. Vodafone has been accused in the past of spending too much on some acquisitions - it was behind the biggest hostile takeover in corporate history when it bought Germany's Mannesmann in 2000. But Arun Sarin, the chief executive, said his group would be sensible about the price. \"We are going to be financially disciplined. We will participate fully but are not going to go over the top,\" he said, adding that Vodafone was continuing due diligence. \"I think there will be greater clarity in the coming days as to what the process is likely to be but the overall process of the sale is likely to go on for the next couple or three weeks.\" He noted the wide interest in Hutchison Essar - which has about 16% of India's mobile phone market - including from the Indian carrier's minority shareholder, Essar. Mr Sarin, who was born in India, said he felt Vodafone had a \"level playing field\" against homegrown bidders but that it was \"very hard to call\" its chances. He was speaking after Vodafone cheered investors with news it had pushed through the 200 million customer mark, adding an unexpected 8.7 million new customers in the three months to December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
