As in: \u201ccan\u2019t this weekend, sorry, I\u2019m having a tidying festival.\u201d But how does it work at an actual festival? Campers at Glastonbury took us inside their tents to talk us through their personal organising systems. \u2018After three airbeds burst in three nights, I bought a double bed frame\u2019 Zoe Jones, Didcot, Oxfordshire \u201cAfter bursting three airbeds in three nights at Reading festival, I don\u2019t do sleeping on the hard ground, so I bought myself a double bed frame to have a bit of comfort. On top of that I\u2019ve got my Airgo mattress. It\u2019s self-inflating \u2013 you leave it for about 10 minutes. I use vacuum pack bags to squash all my clothes down; that pillow then becomes about a third of its size. I\u2019ve got a box underneath which has got all of my toiletries and bits and pieces, so that I can find them. On the lid of the box, I put all my clothes, so that I can just slide it out. I brought a washing line so that we can dry our towels and bikinis. My friends said: \u2018Zoe, why would you bring a washing line?\u2019 Now they all want to use it. It cost me \u00a31. Our friends have a camper van that they\u2019ve driven in \u2013 we did a Tescos order to their house, so they\u2019re bringing all our alcohol for us. The car air freshener, I packed by accident. But it makes the tent smell nice.\u201d \u2018My daughter said, \u2018I can\u2019t believe you brought muesli\u2019 Delyth Pritchard, Cardiff \u201cIt\u2019s our first year at Glastonbury without our children. The oldest is 23 \u2013 she\u2019s flitting between two camps. The youngest is down there somewhere [gestures vaguely]. She\u2019s far too cool to be seen with us. My eldest said: \u2018I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve got muesli here.\u2019 The trick is not bringing loads of stuff, because you have to walk with it. We\u2019re quite pared down this year because we have coach tickets \u2013 normally we would drive and bring more gear. But we have everything we need. The process is to get the tent up, get the bed inflated, throw the stuff about inside and then have a wander, see what\u2019s changed. We always used to be in family camping because we had lots of teenagers with us. It\u2019s quite nice, actually, not having them. It was a bit of a mess last time.\u201d \u2018You never know when you might need a panda hat\u2019 Matthew Thorrington-Smith, Cape Town, South Africa \u201cIt\u2019s an evolving process. Dynamic. The logic was to have things that I most often need easily accessible at the front of the tent. So there\u2019s clothing. A bag of various dress-up things: tattoo sleeves, South African flag \u2013 we\u2019re having a South African-themed day tomorrow \u2013 panda hat. You never know when you might need one. Then we move on to food, all of which has been carefully selected. It\u2019s important to get a good calorie-per-square-centimetre ratio, so we have peanut butter, protein bars, nuts, chocolate. Then alcohol: two litres of gin, two litres of vodka, cordial. I\u2019ve got two Camelbaks (a rucksack with a liquid reservoir). One\u2019s for water. This one\u2019s got gin and cordial \u2013 a classic combo. Then there\u2019s a bag of dirty clothes and toiletries right at the back. I created this system on the fly. It maintains itself for the most part: you take something, you put it back in one of the piles. My friends will tell you I\u2019m very quick and efficient.\u201d \u2018This is causing me anxiety\u2019 Clare Fourel, London \u201cOnly the sleeping mat and your valuables are allowed in the tent. It\u2019s like, order of needs: why do you need to be in the tent? It\u2019s to sleep. I\u2019ve got to have clothes closest and shoes farthest way. If I don\u2019t have that, then I start to get anxious. So this is causing me anxiety right now. There\u2019s been a system breakdown. Something was lost, so then I had to go away, and the thing had to be found, and it was found. We live on a narrow boat, so it\u2019s a similar thing \u2013 you have to have everything in its place, in boxes. Usually you tidy in the morning. But when you come back at night and you\u2019re a bit pissed, you\u2019re not thinking straight \u2013 it\u2019s all over the place, and you have to retrace your steps.\u201d \u2018The sheet masks are a Saturday treat. It\u2019s a bit bougie\u2019 Isabelle Bascombe, London \u201cI need a lot of space to get ready, so that\u2019s why I\u2019ve left this big gap here. Over there is the snack station. I\u2019ve got some eco-friendly straws, reusable bottles. Got some Pringles, some biscuits, some cereal bars, and the best one: Maoams. We\u2019re starting to run low on the drinks already, which is a bit of a shame. Water goes there, by my bed, alcohol there. I don\u2019t want to get them mixed up because they look exactly the same. I\u2019ve got makeup, glitter. The sheet masks \u2013 that\u2019s like a Saturday treat, for when we\u2019re halfway through. It\u2019s a bit bougie \u2013 but any little luxury that we can get. Lots of hairspray. I put all my outfits into little prepacks so I can just grab them. This is very small shorts and a top, socks and pants. How good is that?\u201d \u2018I\u2019ve spent no minutes tidying\u2019 Jim Riach, Montana, US \u201cCheck it out. This is how I live. So this is the lobby area, where I put my socks. Here\u2019s my stash of booze. The system? I just sort of crawl in drunk and crawl out hungover. It\u2019s like this weird thing that happens \u2013 every time I go in, I come out hungover. I\u2019ve spent no minutes tidying. Look, that\u2019s the bottom of my bag, I just threw it in. I spent no time doing anything in here. But it\u2019s pretty tiny. Oh, tidy tents? No way! I thought you were looking for tiny tents! People shouldn\u2019t be living like this!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
