More upsets on the cards? Pick your fixture: Cardiff v Wolves, Chelsea v Huddersfield, Coventry v West Brom, Liverpool v Barnsley. I'm thinking three home wins and a draw at the Ricoh Arena, but I like to keep my predictions on the Norman Tebbit side of conservative. And it's not just football, we have two Guinness Premiership games and some horse racing too, so it should be a busy afternoon. First goal of the day... or not: At the Memorial Ground in the early kick-off Bristol Rovers have a goal chalked off and it remains 0-0. Tennis news: Always one to go above and beyond the call of duty, I bring you news from Andy Murray's semi-final in Open 13. He is cruising through to his second final of the season, taking the first set 6-2 and leading the second 3-1 against Paul-Henri Mathieu. Idle speculation: With Liverpool and Chelsea facing difficult Champions League ties in the coming week can we expect their sides today to be weaker than the second Bluetones album? No news yet, but I'll keep you updated. First goal of the day! A free kick from Rickie Lambert deflects off Jermaine Wright and into the back of the net. 1-0 to Bristol Rovers and we have our first upset of the day on the cards. Five minutes to go. And Andy Murray has won 6-2, 6-2 to move into the final of the Open 13. He will face the winner of Marcos Baghdatis and Mario Ancic. Full-time at the Memorial Ground: And Bristol Rovers are into the last eight of the Cup for the first time in fifty years, 1-0 the final score. So, the upsets continue into the fifth round, let's hope it's not the last. Unsurprising racing news: Kauto Star has cantered to victory in the Commercial First Ascot Chase, his last warm up before the Gold Cup. Weakened team news: Chelsea: Cudicini, Ferreira, Ben-Haim, Terry, Bridge, Sidwell, Obi, Lampard, Kalou, Pizarro, Sinclair. Subs: Hilario, Essien, Carvalho, Shevchenko, Anelka. Huddersfield: Glennon, Sinclair, Clarke, Page, Williams, Collins, Brandon, Holdsworth, Berrett, Beckett, Jevons. Subs: Eastwood, Mirfin, Schofield, Kamara, Booth. Referee: Mark Clattenburg (Tyne &amp; Wear) Liverpool: Itandje, Finnan, Carragher, Hyypia, Riise, Benayoun, Lucas, Alonso, Babel, Kuyt, Crouch. Subs: Martin, Kewell, Gerrard, Pennant, Arbeloa. Barnsley: Steele, Hassell, Souza, Foster, Kozluk, Devaney, De Silva, Howard, Leon, Ferenczi, Nardiello. Subs: Odejayi, Campbell-Ryce, Van Homoet, Coulson, Togwell. Referee: Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire) The day's first email: \"You can't knock that album. They reference the Coen Brothers for Unpainted Arizona's sake,\" writes embittered Bluetones fan Henry Barnes, presumably using the wi-fi in Camden's Good Mixer. Guinness Premiership: Bath lead Wasps 10-0 after 15 minutes, a try from Andy Higgins. 3:02pm: We're off and it's a flying start from Cardiff, a goal after two minutes from Peter Whittingham against Wolves. And, hilariously, Barnsley almost score at Anfield. \"I've a weekend without an Everton game, a Six Nations game or an England game in New Zealand. If it rains in Adelaide, I'm going to demand my money back,\" writes Gary Naylor. How about a trip to the zoo Gary, or a lovely walk in the countryside? After this clockwatch of course. 3.05pm: A try from Danny Cipriani for Wasps and it is 10-10 at the Recreation Ground. Luke Beckett clears off the line to keep things level for Huddersfield at Stamford Bridge. 3.09pm: A stunning goal from Jimmy Floyd-Hasselbaink puts Cardiff 2-0 up at home to Wolves. A great start for Dave Jones against his old club and I can tick that one off on my accumulator. 3.12pm: West Brom are on top against Coventry at the Ricoh and Liverpool are in charge at Anfield. No goals yet though. 3.14pm: West Brom make their pressure pay, Chris Brunt heading home a cross Roman Bedner cross. 1-0. 3.16pm: In the Guinness Premiership it's still 0-0 between Harlequins and Worcester. Darren Ambrose makes it 1-0 to Charlton against Watford at The Valley in The Championship, with Paul Merson trying and failing to pronounce the name Zheng Ziyi. 3.18pm: Chelsea Reserves go 1-0 up against Huddersfield, Scott Sinclair crossing for Frank Lampard, who knocks it in from the edge of the area. 3.24pm: Leicester go one up against Norwich as Ian Holloway breathes a sigh of relief, Ian Hume the scorer. 3.27pm: Barnsley still holding their own at Anfield, Luke Steele saving well from a Ryan Babel shot. \"Since West Brom have taken the lead, has any team ever won the old Second Division (League Championship) and the FA Cup in the same season?\" Asks George Templeton, mistaking me for someone who would have a pile of Rothmans Football Yearbooks in browsing distance and not just a dog-eared copy of Steve Bruce's Striker. Can anyone help on this one? 3.30pm: In the rugby tries from Skinner and Luscombe have put Harlequins 12-3 up against Worcester. Meanwhile, another great save from Luke Steele at Anfield. 3.32pm: Goal at Anfield, 1-0 to Liverpool. Ryan Babel gets to the by-line and crosses for Dirk Kuyt to toe-poke home, his first goal in 14 games. He's found his level. 3.35pm: Mac Millings emails to ask. \"Dear Josh, So, how DO you pronounce Zheng Ziyi?\" Well Mac, I pronounce it Zheng Ziyi. Rico Gear gets a try back for Worcester, it's 13-8 at The Stoop. 3.38pm: A Danny Shittu own-goal puts Charlton 2-0 up against Watford, against the run of play that one. 3.40pm: John Terry, back in the Chelsea side today, clears off the line to keep them ahead against Huddersfield. 3.42pm: \"Liverpool should play pub sides more often. Dirk will feel like he's back in Holland,\" writes Rowan Blades being slightly harsh on Barnsley. I imagine he will be back in Holland before long, Rowan. Bath lead Wasps 20-13 at half-time. 3.45pm: Unbelievable! Michael Collins gets in behind the Chelsea Reserves back line and squeezes the ball inside Carlo Cudicini's near-post to equalise for Huddersfield. Xabi Alonso clashes heads with Lucas and blood streams down his face, he goes off early and that's half-time at Anfield and Stamford Bridge. 3.49pm: West Brom lead Coventry 1-0 at half-time, Cardiff are 2-0 up against Wolves and Charlton lead Watford by the same scoreline in the Championship. \"Just in case you haven't already received a thousand emails on this subject, the only previous winners of Division Two (or Division One, or the Championship etc.) and the FA Cup in the same season are West Bromwich Albion,\" writes Ross Nell in response to George Templeton's question. \"But surely you'd need a basic understanding of the 1930/1931 season to work for Guardian Unlimited?\" Sadly they will let any old chancer through their doors these days Ross, that's the internet age for you. Pronouncing Zheng Ziyi: \"Wow, your Chinese pronunciation is excellent. How long have you studied Mandarin?\" Asks Mac Millings. Well, you know, about 20 minutes. I'm a natural but I don't like to brag. \"Greetings from Beijing,\" shouts Richard Greaves. \"I could offer a decent stab at how to correctly pronounce Zheng Ziyi, however I think I'd first prefer to hear some suggestions on the correct way to pronounce Danny Shittu.\" 4.05pm: We're off again and there are no goals or changes yet. In the rugby it's 28-20 to Wasps. 4.08pm: Johnnie Jackson has made it 1-0 to Colchester at Hull and Ipswich are 1-0 up against Blackpool. Michael Doyle has been sent off for absolutely nothing for Coventry against West Brom. 4.10pm: \"If Huddersfield emulate Liverpool's draw at Chelsea last week, then who's the pub team amongst that lot?\" Asks Ian Copestake. Well, I'll just put all the results into the calculator, tap, tap, tap... Dirk Kuyt. 4.12pm: Kalou puts the ball in the net for Chelsea but he's offside. It was going in anyway, what a fool. Big news from Anfield where Barnsley have equalised, a Steve Foster header. Could two upsets be on the cards? 4.15pm: It's all going off at Anfield where Benayoun rounds the keeper and but fails to score. At The Valley two goals in a minute and Watford are back level John-Joe O'Toole and Dan Shittu, however that's pronounced. 4.18pm: Frank Lampard gets his second of the day, tucking away a rebound to put Chelsea Reserves 2-1 up. West Brom go 2-0 up, Roman Bednar profiting from a mistake from Coventry goalkeeper Andy Marshall. \"West Brom did not win the old second division in 1931 - they came second behind Everton,\" Russell Turner writes to correct Ross Nell's earlier email. \"The Baggies however remain the only second flight club to win the cup and gain promotion in the same season.\" 4.21pm: Leicester have gone 2-0 up in the Championship and in the rugby it is 35-20 to Wasps at the Recreation Ground. \"I'd like to add my support to the pro-Bluetones cause here. Solomon Bites The Worm was a classic single. Haven't heard the rest of the album but I'm sure it's not too bad,\" says James Errington, adding: \"You're not John Harris are you?\" Sadly not James, though I did once stand in the same room as him, he's very tall and has very dry hair. 4.24pm: Barnsley holding on by the skin of the Yorkshire teeth at Anfield, Lucas hitting the bar. Frazier Campbell has equalised for Hull against Colchester. 4.26pm: Another great save from Luke Steele, this time Benayoun with the chance. Liverpool will win the FA Cup, mark my words. Meanwhile Scott Sinclair has a goal disallowed at Stamford Bridge for offside. 4.29pm: Kalou has put Chelsea Reserves into the last eight, making it 3-1 against Huddersfield. 3-0 to West Brom, Bednar again. 4.32pm: Gerrard and Kewell are on for Liverpool, who are getting desperate. 4.34pm: In the rugby Wasps are leading Bath 42-27 and Harlequins are 15-8 up against Worcester. Meanwhile, Liverpool fans getting worried include Louise Smith. \"I can't believe I'm wasting part of my romantic Valentine's/birthday weekend in Paris to listen to Liverpool struggle against Barnsley. My girlfriend has gone from rolling her eyes to wondering if she should have me committed. Sort this out, Rafa!\" Hang your head in shame Rafa, you have officially ruined Valentines Day. 4.37pm: Ishmael Miller has made it 4-0 to West Brom against Coventry, his 11th goal of the season. 4.39pm: Zolton Gera makes it 5-0 for West Brom, my prediction of a draw is starting to look a little shaky. Meanwhile DJ Campbell has made it 3-0 to Leicester against Norwich. 4.41pm: Harry Kewell has hit the top of the crossbar and Luke Steele makes a string of stunning saves as Liverpool fail to break the deadlock. It's his debut, this is amazing stuff. Oh, the FA Cup, huh? [befuddled sigh at the romance of it all] 4.44pm: 4-0 to Leicester, Stephen Clemence the scorer. Barnsley have a shot from distance at Anfield, they couldn't could they? Nope, it's saved by Itandje. 4.47pm: Luke \"Lev Yashin\" Steele saves from Kewell. And oh my word, IT'S HAPPENED! Brian Howard strikes from distance in front of the Kop and it is IN!!!!!!!!!! It's 2-1 to Barnsley. And that's full-time. Barnsley have won at Anfield! 4.50pm: The GU sports desk is in shock. \"Rafa is done,\" writes Ian Copestake. 4.54pm: Full-times coming in: Charlton 2-2 Watford in the Championship, Cardiff 2-0 Wolves, Chelsea 3-1 Huddersfield, Coventry 0-5 West Brom and, oh, Liverpool 1-2 Barnsley. 4.59pm: The rugby full-times are Bath 34-42 Wasps and Harlequins 36-15 Wasps. But the real story is of course at Anfield, what does everyone make of that, I'm going to be hanging around for some reaction from Anfield (and because I don't have anything better to do with my time) so let's hear what you think. Is that it for Rafa? Brian Howard: FA Cup Hero Reggie Rhinestone writes to point out that it is a sharp turnaround for Brian Howard, who was once a recognised wit and raconteur of the early 20th Century. \"At Oxford he was the leading light of the most extravagant social set and an aesthete who hunted. In the twenties he was the impresario of the wildest parties and pulled off the craziest practical jokes. Nevertheless, he became a passionate anti-Nazi in the thirties, after having been sent to Germany to be analysed, and later an inspired literary critic. After the War he became increasingly drunk, quarrelsome and dependent, and finally, after the death of his last lover, Sam, killed himself,\" according to his biography. It seems anyone can score against Liverpool these days. Barnsley manager Simon Davey seems pretty chuffed: \"Fantastic. We had a gameplan, we kept it tight at 1-0 down and we got one chance and put it away. Luke Steele pulled off some worldies on his debut. It's a great day for all the supports, the board and everyone. It's a fairytale and you look at what dreams are made of, it will live with the players for a long, long while.\" Is Rafa for the chop? \"I don't think so, I think his future hangs on the Champions League result. So Rafa shouldn't be too worried with going out of the FA Cup, he'll be at Anfield for a while longer. I'm pretty certain I'll be right on this one just like I was right about Big Sam lasting out the season at Newcastle,\" writes Richard Greaves. \"Surely even the muppets running Liverpool recognise what folly it would be to sack Rafa days before their most important game of the season, on the back of a loss - though shocking - in a relatively unimportant cup competition. However, given the way Inter are performing, you'd be inclined to believe that this is the beginning (or maybe the half way point?) of the end for Rafa,\" says Angus Chisholm. \"I guess now Rafa is out as soon as Liverpool is out of the Champions League, so he has couple of weeks,\" says George Templeton. Brian Howard is understandably delighted: \"The keeper's had an unbelievable debut and we stole it at the end. I was busy whinging to the referee and the ball came to me and I just struck it sweet as and it is the best feeling I've had in football. I thought I'd just hit it as if it went in the stands it would have wasted some time.\" Luke Steele: England's new No1 \"I got a call from West Brom on Wednesday to tell me Barnsley wanted to take me on loan and I'd be playing against Liverpool and it was one of those ones you don't say no to. I've never been with the Barnsley lads and I had to find out what everyone was called so I had to find out to shout at them. I was pleased to keep them out, the lads defended brilliantly. I was just so happy to be out there, it hasn't sunk in at the moment.\" \"I'm intrigued with the footballing 'fairytale' cliche. I've never read anything by the Brothers Grimm that involves an away trip to a Premier League ground, and I've yet to see Little Red Riding Hood on the scoresheet in any domestic fixtures,\" muses Richard Greaves. \"Perhaps the eating of Bear porridge and sleeping on consecutively more suitable beds is a cunning literary metaphor for 'givin' 'em a good game and nickin it at the end'.\" I've being saying all season that Rafa should pick the beanstalk if that helps? Ho and indeed ho, this is what happens if you keep me here beyond full-time. No sign of Rafa yet. Here's Rafa \"In terms of the work rate of the team you cannot say anything but we are drawing and losing games because we are not taking our chances and finishing games. The keeper made great saves but that's football and that's the cup. We can only prepare for the next game and start preparing for it. I think that the team was controlling the game in the first half but the second half was difficult to explain, that was the reality. We knew that was an important competition so we must start training tomorrow and get our heads up.\" He looked none too pleased. Right, that's about that. A huge day in the Cup and a tiring one, I'm going to have a cup of tea. But if you still want more why not join Scott Murray for Man Utd v Arsenal? Cheers for all your emails, sorry about the ones I couldn't use. Bye."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
