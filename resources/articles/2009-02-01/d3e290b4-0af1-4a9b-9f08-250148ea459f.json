Instead it was Jack Bannister, the former Warwickshire seamer who has gone on to have a long career in journalism and broadcasting, who severed his honorary life membership of the county because of his \"despair about the lack of governance\" of the game, and Warwickshire's continued support for the leading officials of the England and Wales Cricket Board. In an email to the club Bannister describes his \"great sadness\" at ending a connection with Edgbaston going back more than 60 years and including a 20-year playing career. \"I have become totally disappointed and disillusioned with the performance of the ECB chairman [Giles Clarke], vice-chairman [Dennis Amiss] and chief executive [David Collier] in the last two months,\" he writes. \"It seems that the Warwickshire club supported those three men and the decisions made regarding the sacking of captain and coach, and their subsequent refusal to admit any misjudgment on the Stanford affair. \"The Stanford involvement leaves me in despair about the lack of governance of a game that has been my life for so many years. In particular I have squirmed at the radio interview performances of the above named three senior officers when ducking, diving and generally evading any suggestion of personal responsibility. Yet not a hint of resignation from anyone at having led English cricket into dealings with a man they knew months ago had been turned down by Australia, South Africa, India and the ICC. Such gross misjudgment has sheltered behind a defence of obfuscation falsely quoting 'the benefit of hindsight'. The chairman's quote that the Stanford episode is now 'historical' is an affront to all cricket lovers \u2013 and that includes me. \"I have always had many trusted sources in cricket and do not know one that disagrees with me. This email concerns mainly the three officers already identified but the apparent support of the Warwickshire club for them prompts this decision. So ends over 60 years of association with a club that so often made me proud.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
