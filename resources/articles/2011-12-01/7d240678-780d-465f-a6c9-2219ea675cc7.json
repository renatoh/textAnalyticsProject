That kind of mischief isn't among the ingredients of the Philiadelphia collective's first concept album; the story of a dead young man called Redford's struggles and mistakes in reverse. It opens with a heart monitor flatlining, before tinkling pianos and warm melodies deliver lines pondering mortality and whether heavenly bagpipes await those \"born on the wrong side of the crack pipe\". It isn't all as harrowing as that sounds \u2013 the luscious tunes of Make My, The Other Side and the poppier I Remember make it an iron fist in a velvet glove. What it isn't \u2013 quite \u2013 is the magnum opus it could be. The second half loses impetus, although Sufjan Stevens's Redford, delivered in three movements, makes a powerful elegy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
