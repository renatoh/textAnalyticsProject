The lucrative deal had gone unsigned for months as the manager sought to enshrine his authority until 2013, and results on the field had suffered. Four months on, however, Everton are prospering again from the assured guidance of David Moyes. It was a notably more relaxed Everton manager who approached Monday's derby, his demeanour shaped by the form his team took to Anfield. It was a stark contrast to the despondency that greeted the start of the season and spilled out following the feeble defeat to Liverpool at Goodison Park in September. With a deft flick of Tim Cahill's head and a deserved point, Moyes' composure was vindicated and Everton's pursuit of a third successive European place gained wider credence. It is testament to the spirit the Scot has forged at Goodison and his eye for an astute purchase that they are in this position at all. Sixth in the Premier League is familiar territory for Moyes and Everton, but so was the frustration of last summer \u2013 replicated to a lesser degree in this transfer window \u2013 when the Goodison board struggled to secure the budget the manager felt was required to build on the previous campaign's fifth-place finish. Moves to rebuild the central midfield, after Lee Carsley left on a free to Birmingham, only came to fruition late on deadline day when Marouane Fellaini arrived from Standard Li\u00e8ge for \u00a315m. 'Microphone head', as one acerbic wag christened the Belgium international, then looked on as his former employers dumped Everton out of the Uefa Cup at the qualifying stage. Everton's season has since mirrored their record signing's integration into English football, their initial stumbling, subdued steps replaced by a more purposeful and effective stride as Moyes again proved his worth despite limited options. \"This is another point against a good team that is trying to win the title and buying players with that in mind. We are not,\" the Everton manager said pointedly after Monday's derby. \"But this shows how far Everton have come and how the stability we have at the club has helped us.\" When asked before the derby if Everton could profit from Rafael Ben\u00edtez's contractual wrangle at Liverpool, Moyes strenuously denied that his own stand-off had affected results earlier this season. Others have their doubts. (The delay was a result of Moyes' demand for continued autonomy in the event of Bill Kenwright selling the club.) The manager's argument is that his squad was ill-equipped for the start of this season due to injuries and the lack of reinforcements. Regardless, his side have rediscovered confidence through adversity \u2013 not for the first time under Moyes. Serious injury to Yakubu Ayegbeni and James Vaughan, plus another lengthy lay-off for the risky signing that was Louis Saha, flattened Everton's attack and forced their manager to play Cahill in his best position (not central midfield) while utilising Fellaini's height in a more advanced role. The continued lack of resources for central midfield led to Mikel Arteta being restored to his favoured role and the Spaniard, now fit following groin surgery last summer, has responded with his finest form for over a year. In defence, Joseph Yobo's injury forced another productive reshuffle with Joleon Lescott seizing his second chance to impress alongside the imposing Phil Jagielka and Leighton Baines, outstanding against Liverpool, finally getting an extended opportunity to earn his manager's confidence. Much was made at Anfield of Everton's starting line-up costing only fractionally more than Liverpool paid for Fernando Torres: approximately \u00a327.9m compared with the much-disputed \u00a326.5m, although had Yakubu been fit and Fellaini eligible the visitors' total would have risen by \u00a326.25m. The dearth of options on the Everton bench on Monday should also caution against over-confidence ahead of Sunday's FA Cup reunion at Anfield. Moyes has already shown his hand to Ben\u00edtez, but fortunately for Everton it is a lot stronger than other clubs with vastly superior resources currently have to offer.
