The final two rounds last weekend began with Baden-Baden and Solingen on 24 points from 13 matches, Werder Bremen 23 and Mulheim 20. Baden-Baden is the cash-rich team and even boasts the world champion, Vishy Anand, and world No1, Magnus Carlsen in its squad, though the Indian has played only two games and the Norwegian none. But the active regulars are so strong that Michael Adams, the England No1, plays only on a mid-board in the eight-man team. Werder Bremen, which has links with the football club, fields the England No3, Luke McShane, on a high board and his skills have helped Bremen advance to the top in recent seasons. Solingen has a fine historic pedigree and in the 1970s was the strongest club in the world. Bremen beat Solingen 5.5-2.5 with McShane drawing, but Baden-Baden played a shrewd match against Mulheim, with Adams and four others halving early and looking to cash in three won positions. One went wrong but 4.5-3.5 proved enough. Both favourites won easily in the final round, so Baden-Baden took the title with 28 points, ahead of Bremen on 27. From an English viewpoint a tie, a play-off and a possible Adams v McShane clash would have been more interesting. McShane's win below featured the English Attack 6 Be3 followed by 15 Nc5! giving Black weak doubled e pawns. Black tried for counterplay down the b file but the white king proved safer and 31 Bf4! (Qa5 32 Bxd6) won decisive material and McShane mopped up.
