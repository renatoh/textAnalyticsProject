Strands of hair plastered across his forehead twinkle at the prospect of rich donors. And this is how many people still see those whose job it is to ask alumni to donate, says Mary Blair, director of development and alumni relations at the London School of Economics . \"There's a distrust of people in fundraising,\" she says. \"It is as if they think we possess magic powers to make their wallets fly out of their pockets. I could maybe talk you out of \u00a320, but not out of \u00a3100,000. You have to want to give a sum like that.\" If some of the public are not on the side of fundraisers, the government is. Last week it announced that for every \u00a32 an English university raises from alumni, philanthropists and businesses, it would give \u00a31, up to a maximum of \u00a32m a year for each institution. The scheme will start next year. Completing the jigsaw Newer universities and colleges without fundraising offices will each be given \u00a3100,000 to establish them. The government hopes the three-year scheme, worth \u00a3200m, will stimulate an extra \u00a3400m in private donations to universities. Tony Blair is said to see encouraging endowments as \"completing the jigsaw\" of higher education, following the introduction of \u00a33,000 tuition fees in the autumn. The aim is to rival the endowments of Canadian and North American universities, particularly those in the ivy league. \"It's breathtaking how far we have to go to be anywhere near US fundraising levels,\" says Professor Eric Thomas, the vice-chancellor of Bristol University, who led a taskforce on donations to higher education in 2004. The Sutton Trust, an educational charity, reports that the gap between the 10 largest university endowments in the UK and the US has widened by \u00a312.5bn in the last three years, and that the UK seriously lags behind the US and Canada in terms of funds raised and rates of alumni who give. The Council for Advancement and Support of Education (Case), which represents those who work in alumni relations worldwide, says UK universities are 50 years behind their US peers and 20 years behind Canadian counterparts. Only Oxford and Cambridge universities compare with American colleges, raising \u00a3185m in 2004-05, holding endowments of \u00a36bn and achieving alumni giving rates of 10%. The combined endowment of all other UK universities is an estimated \u00a31.9bn - yet Harvard alone has an endowment worth \u00a313.4bn, while Yale and Stanford have \u00a38bn and \u00a36.4bn respectively. At Princeton, 61% of alumni donate; only nine UK universities report that 3% or more of their alumni do so, according to the Sutton Trust. UK universities are, however, improving fast. In 2001, Nottingham University raised its target of \u00a330m over five years, a year early. Last year, Edinburgh University announced it was aiming for \u00a3350m by 2011 and has so far raised \u00a3200m. And Cambridge University said last week that it had raised \u00a3500m of the \u00a31bn it hopes to drum up by 2012. Could their success be partly down to an influx of North American and Canadian fundraisers hired to work in top positions in UK university alumni relations offices? Oxford, Nottingham, Durham, Bristol, the LSE, Edinburgh, Aston and Warwick have fundraisers from Canada or the US. \"Where we are from, being asked for donations as a student or alumnus is just an accepted part of university culture,\" says Young Dawkins, who was president of the University of New Hampshire foundation in the US before becoming the vice-principal for development and alumni of Edinburgh University. \"We have also been doing this kind of thing for a lot longer.\" In the US, students are encouraged to feel a sense of belonging to their year group, or \"class\". \"The class of 73 competes with the class of 74 to raise funds for their college, for example,\" says Jon Dellandrea, Oxford University's pro vice-chancellor for development and external affairs, and former vice-president of the University of Toronto. He adds that in North America, there is an \"unabashed notion that it is reasonable to expect people to support the organisation\", which could include asking students in their final year for donations. Tania Rawlinson, director of campaigns and alumni relations at Bristol University, says that last year her former university, an ivy league institution, asked her nine times to donate: \"My expectation has been that I joined a community for life and that includes being asked for money.\" But will such techniques be employed here - and would we want them to be? \"I would feel it was entirely inappropriate to approach a UK donor or alumnus with that kind of persistence,\" Rawlinson admits. \"But we need to stop being embarrassed about asking for money in the UK. I would be sad if in a decade's time students here weren't expecting their universities to ask them for donations.\" No badgering Moreover, says Liesl Elder, director of development at Durham University and the former campaign director of Santa Clara University in California: \"Effective fundraising doesn't necessarily have to involve badgering. It's about helping people to align their generosity with the university.\" Dawkins says UK universities are not necessarily going to take on US methods. \"Scotland will find its own way of fundraising,\" he says. \"People are very generous here, but they are probably not interested in receiving nine mails a year. However, the British can learn some excellent lessons from the States on how to organise the development office, for example.\" Aniela Shuckburgh, who worked at Harvard before becoming Cambridge University's head of campaign affairs, disagrees that American fundraising methods are aggressive. \"They have proved successful,\" she says. \"But it is a mistake to assume we have to do as they do in the States.\" The fundraisers say their problem is not recruiting donors, but experienced personnel. \"We have a desperate need for staff who understand fundraising, and my worry is whether we can train enough people to take advantage of this golden opportunity,\" says Joanna Motion, vice-president for international operations at Case. \"US and Canadian fundraisers working over here bring a level of confidence and a depth of experience that few from the UK can match.\" Dawkins agrees: \"Many come from the charity sector, which is fantastic, but the education sector is just not the same.\" But both are optimistic about the future and encouraged by the government's announcement last week. Motion says: \"This will concentrate the minds of the fundraisers and attract the attention of the donors.\" Dellandrea hopes the government will go on to match the most generous donations universities receive. And they deny any worries that student debt or top-up fees, introduced in the autumn, could put off potential donors. On the contrary, they argue, once you pay for something you value it more. \"US fees are, after all, much higher than in the UK anyway,\" says Dawkins. If he turns out to be wrong, there is always another way. Last year, Cambridge in America, a society for Cambridge graduates living in the US, collected a staggering $38m (\u00a319.4m) from just 1,900 donors."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
