Everton had a \u00a340m offer for the 27-year-old rejected a fortnight ago, when Sigurdsson stunned Swansea officials and team-mates by pulling out of the club\u2019s pre-season tour of the United States, and an improved deal met a similar fate on Monday. That bid is understood to have been \u00a340m plus \u00a35m in add-ons. Talks between the clubs, however, are expected to continue with Ronald Koeman keen to add the midfielder to his expensive recruitment drive this week. Everton play their first competitive game of the season, a Europa League third qualifying round first leg against MFK Ruzomberok of Slovakia, on Thursday. The Swansea owners, Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien, issued a strongly worded statement warning Sigurdsson\u2019s suitors they would not be bullied into selling the club\u2019s player of the year following Everton\u2019s initial offer. They also questioned whether the former Tottenham Hotspur player had been tapped up with Sigurdsson believed to be keen on a switch to Goodison Park. Their position has not changed despite Sigurdsson insisting he was not in the right frame of mind to go on the US tour. Swansea believe their valuation of a consistently creative talent to be fair in a transfer market where Manchester City paid \u00a350m for the right-back Kyle Walker. With negotiations continuing, however, the likelihood of a deal remains. Everton have spent around \u00a3100m this summer on Jordan Pickford, Michael Keane, Davy Klaassen, Wayne Rooney and Sandro Ramirez but Koeman wants to add Sigurdsson plus another forward to the squad before the Premier League season begins. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 July 2017. An earlier version said MFK Ruzomberok of Slovenia. This has been corrected to Slovakia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
