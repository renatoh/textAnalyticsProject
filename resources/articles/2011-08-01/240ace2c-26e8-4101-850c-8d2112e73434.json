When you can't report it. Nowadays, it's hard to conceive of a time when information simply could not be rapidly disseminated. But on 21 August 1991, I had one of the world's great scoops \u2013 but no way to communicate it. I was in the Crimea at Mikhail Gorbachev's luxury villa on the shores of the Black Sea. The Soviet security ministers had mounted a coup against the president to block the signing of a treaty which would have turned the Soviet Union into a loose confederation. They put Gorbachev under house arrest, cut all his links to the outside world and announced he was ill. It sounded dubious but no one knew whether he might have been poisoned or incapacitated in some other way. On the fourth day I finally managed to get into the villa and speak to him. I could verify he was fit and well. But how to get the news out? The only phones in the building were part of the Kremlin system and we were told we could not use them. Getting back to Moscow seemed the best option, but that too was a problem. We tried to explain to officials that it was important for the world to know that Gorbachev was well, free and back in charge. They seemed unimpressed. After a long 20 minutes two minivans appeared to take us back to the airport. In the terminal I tried to phone the Guardian's Moscow office but a Kremlin operator, hearing my foreign accent, refused to put me through. By then, Gorbachev had flown out and I realised that his arrival in Moscow in two hours' time would be filmed. The news of his liberation would become known without us. The scoop was gone, and we were stuck in the Crimea. Eventually they put us and various officials on a presidential Il-62, to fly back to Vnukovo airport. By the time we landed and I got back to the office, it was already tomorrow. There was no website, only the printed paper. I had missed the last edition, and there was nothing to do but run my exclusive account of Gorbachev's liberation some 30 hours after it had happened. No Twitter, no mobile phones, no internet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
