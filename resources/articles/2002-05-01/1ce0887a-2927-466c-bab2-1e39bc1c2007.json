So it probably does not cut much ice with him that Sri Lanka are currently rated the third-best side in the world, nor that his own team are three places below them. In Hussain's estimation the tourists may even be second only to Australia on current form, having won nine Tests in a row. That sequence should be given due regard as a terrific achievement, Hussain thinks, but with the qualification that all those wins bar the last, in Lahore, were at home. Conditions for today's first Test at Lord's are quite unlike Colombo, Kandy or Galle. It is not wise, especially with regard to England, to be bullish; but, the strength of the Sri Lankan batting notwithstanding, England became favourites to win this match and probably the next at Edgbaston once Muttiah Muralitharan damaged his shoulder and was ruled out for the immediate future. Sri Lanka have not won a Test in the past decade without the off-spinner in their side, and moreover this is Lord's, where the seamers hold sway whatever the time of year. And this is the earliest ever start to a Test in this country; Ashley Giles, England's sole concession to spin in selection, was sent back to Warwickshire yesterday morning because, after a wet fortnight or so, the water table must be high and there is likely to be plenty of residual moisture in the square. Given such circumstances, there is a definite feeling that with the return of John Crawley, Dominic Cork and Alec Stewart England have selected not so much a sledgehammer as a wrecking ball to crack a nut. But the captain defended his selections vehemently. \"We are not naive,\" Hussain said. \"We presumed we would get the sort of reaction we have. But we don't select sides to get the right reaction from the media, we choose the best side available for the next match but not for the future. We have to give Sri Lanka the respect they deserve. \"We are not such a great, superior England side that we can start just throwing people in and give them Tests and say it's a great time to blood new players, because there are no easy Test matches. It is easy for those on the periphery to say, 'Give him a go.' But we have not won a series in the last four, and Sri Lanka are a top outfit. \"So we have chosen the leading run-scorer in county cricket this year and the leading wicket-taker. You earn the right to come into this dressing room and play for England, it is as simple as that, and we do not underestimate any opposition, least of all this one.\" However, England do appear to be selling themselves short. There was surely room not for experiment - Test cricket is not the place for that - but for more heed being paid to the middle term. Stewart is a case in point. Success here, even moderate, will surely cement his position for the next 10 months, even though the injured Jamie Foster has been given a central contract. England will decide this morning whether it will be Cork, Alex Tudor or both providing the backup to Andy Caddick, Matthew Hoggard and Andy Flintoff. Cork is the likeliest to play. The Sri Lankans too will probably choose four seamers, with the left-armers Chaminda Vaas and Nuwan Zoysa joined by another left-armer, Ruchira Perera, and Buddika Fernando and seven frontline batsmen. The weather forecast for the first two days is good, and overhead conditions tend to make as much impact as those in the pitch. But expect the captain who wins the toss to field first. \u00b7 The Australian surgeon who has overseen Muttiah Muralitharan's recovery from a shoulder injury has hinted that the Sri Lankan may make a surprise return for the second Test. David Young said: \"Muralitharan strikes fear into the Englishmen, and Dav Whatmore obviously feels that, psychologically, it would be better if he was playing. He's going to see how he goes when he comes out of the brace and starts bowling, and I guess if he comes up quickly he may still play the second Test.\" The teams England (from): Nasser Hussain (Essex, capt), Marcus Trescothick (Somerset), Mark Butcher (Surrey), Michael Vaughan (Yorkshire), Graham Thorpe (Surrey), John Crawley (Hampshire), Andy Flintoff (Lancashire), Alec Stewart (Surrey, wkt), Alex Tudor (Surrey), Dominic Cork (Derbyshire), Andy Caddick (Somerset), Matthew Hoggard (Yorkshire).
