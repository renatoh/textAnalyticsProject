Aragon\u00e9s could theoretically be subjected to a maximum fine of \u20ac30,000 (\u00a321,000) and the loss of his coaching licence, after he referred to Thierry Henry as a \"black shit\" and responded to questions about racism by recalling England's colonial past, declaring: \"I know who it was who ran after game like wolves.\" However, he is unlikely to be punished so severely and is said to have privately threatened to quit should any action be brought against him. England's friendly against Spain at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium on November 17 was marred by racist chants and monkey noises directed at England's black players. After the match both Aragon\u00e9s and the federation's director of external relations, Fernando Garrido, failed to condemn the chants. The federation only issued a statement three days after the match, under pressure from political bodies, the media and Madrid's 2012 Olympic bid committee. This latest decision comes in light of a motion, led by the Izquierda Verde (Green Left) and passed by the Spanish parliament on Tuesday, requesting a new code of sporting ethics in which police would be obliged to take greater action against racist chants. It also follows a formal request from Spain's anti-violence commission that action be taken against Aragon\u00e9s. The recently re-elected federation president Angel Mar\u00eda Villar reluctantly passed that request on to the competition committee. The committee will meet on Tuesday December 21 to name a judge to lead the inquiry and summons Aragon\u00e9s, who will then have three days to accept or decline the invitation. It will be the judge, too, who decides upon any sanction. Rafael Blanco, the president of the anti-violence commission, said: \"We cannot decide the outcome, we cannot be judge and jury, and we cannot therefore say what the investigation will entail, but there must be one.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
