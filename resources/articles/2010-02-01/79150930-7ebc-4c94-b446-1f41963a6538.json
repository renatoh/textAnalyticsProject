Hibs midfielder Lee Miller was sent off during a goalless first half at Fir Park, the Republic of Ireland international receiving a straight red card in the 32nd minute for a late tackle on Jim O'Brien. The hosts enjoyed the better of the play but they struggled to create clear chances until good forward play from John Sutton set up the Scotland Under-21 striker Murphy to strike a left-footed shot into the net with eight minutes of the match remaining. Hibs pushed forward but the on-loan Everton keeper John Ruddy ensured his seventh clean sheet in eight games when he held a Chris Hogg header from a Merouane Zemmama corner, and Murphy and O'Brien came close on the break. The defeat completed a miserable week for Hibs who were beaten 5-1 at St Johnstone in midweek. The management team of Craig Brown and Archie Knox continue their positive influence on Motherwell's results \u2013 their team are now unbeaten in eight SPL games and within four points of Dundee United in fourth place. Kilmarnock and St Mirren shared a 1-1 draw. Chris Maguire gave Kilmarnock a slender lead that their first-half performance barely deserved as the Buddies' dismal run looked set to continue at Rugby Park. Maguire, on loan from Aberdeen, put Jimmy Calderwood's side ahead from close range in the 32nd minute after Paul Gallacher spilled a tame shot from Craig Bryson. Saints were in control of possession for much of the first period and carved out good chances for Billy Mehmet and the striker Michael Higdon in particular. Mehmet struck a superb volley into the left-hand corner in the 82nd minute to claim a deserved point. Steven Pressley secured his first win in management as bottom-placed Falkirk deservedly came from behind to beat Aberdeen 3-1. The Dons initially responded well to Tuesday night's shock Scottish Cup defeat by Raith Rovers when a Charlie Mulgrew free-kick gave them a fifth-minute lead. But Pedro Moutinho quickly levelled for the Bairns, whose domination of the rest of the half was finally rewarded when captain Darren Barr put them ahead three minutes before the break. Richard Foster was booked for a cynical foul on Enoch Showunmi on the left edge of the box and Scott Arfield crossed the ball in for Barr to nod home at the far post. Showunmi could have made it 3-1 in stoppage time but Mulgrew's shoulder challenge was enough to force him to shoot straight at Stuart Nelson. The home side put the game beyond doubt when a Burton O'Brien free-kick found Ryan Flynn down the left and the young winger's cross was met by a sublime scissor kick from Showunmi, whose first goal in Scottish football capped a fine performance from the striker. The victory brings Falkirk to within a point of Hamilton Academicals. Sixth-placed Hearts host Hamilton Accies at Tynecastle today requiring three points as they chase Motherwell and Dundee United and attempt to steer their season back on track. Rangers' game at St Johnstone was subject to a late postponement due to a section of the McDiarmid Park pitch being frozen, giving the champions extra rest ahead of next weekend's Old Firm derby. Nine other Scottish league games were called off yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
