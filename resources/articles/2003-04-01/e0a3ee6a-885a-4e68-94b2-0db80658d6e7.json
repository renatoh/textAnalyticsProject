Children who might have been reluctant readers, it is said, have been lured into a love of books through an addiction to Harry Potter's adventures. It is a case that is hard to prove. However, it is possible to show that the opposite contention - that Harry has stolen the market from other books - is false. Since 1998, children's book sales through bookshops have increased by 26m copies. Leaving Harry out of the reckoning, children's sales have increased in that time by 1m copies. A closer look at the children's market reveals a more worrying statistic: that purchases of books for the youngest ages have shown a 23% drop since 1999. The birth rate may be falling, but not by that much. Meanwhile, the biggest increase in enthusiasm for books is being registered among 55 to 74-year-olds: a pleasing phenomenon, but one that, combined with static figures among other age groups, may suggest that the core book audience is ageing. You would not guess this trend from an observation of publishers' lead fiction promotions, which concentrate largely on appealing to people under 40. These demographic statistics, and a blizzard of further ones, appear in Books and the Consumer, an annual survey of book buying. They show that the consumer books market is what economists describe as \"mature\": it finished showing any significant growth some time ago. In Britain last year, it was worth just over \u00a32bn. * One section of the market that is supposed to be youthful, but seems to be reaching middle age a lot faster than enthusiasts predicted, is the internet. In 2000, internet book sales in Britain - most of them through Amazon.co.uk - were worth 5% of the book market. In 2001, the figure was again 5%. Last year, it went up to 6%. Only a few years ago, visionaries were telling us that the world wide web would change all the rules of business, and that internet sites would command 15% of book sales by the middle of this decade. * More stats. As I write above, the book industry is a mature one: its customers are not multiplying. They may even be decreasing. According to new research, a third of Britons bought no books last year, and 28% never read books at all. The research is the first phase of a project investigating ways to expand the market, and is designed to give an indication of the size of the challenge. In the last survey of this kind, one respondent who bumped up the figure for the average time people spent reading each day was the woman who devoted 187 hours to Geri Halliwell's autobiography If Only. After that, she moved on to Victoria Beckham's Learning To Fly. * Dorling Kindersley has won the rights to publish a book to accompany the BBC's Big Read, voting for which closes at midnight tonight. The book will be out in November, to coincide with programmes on the top 10 of the 100 most popular titles in the poll. The publisher says that it aims to produce \"a handsomely illustrated book on the 100 titles, and to make it appealing to all ages by sprinkling it with entertaining lists, quotes and statistical trivia\". * Many readers feel at sea when trying to buy children's books. A second edition of a guide entitled Who Next...? may help. It lists more than 400 authors with suggestions of others who should appeal to the same readership. Who Next...? (\u00a313.99) is available from the library and information statistics unit at Loughborough University (tel 01509 223071).
