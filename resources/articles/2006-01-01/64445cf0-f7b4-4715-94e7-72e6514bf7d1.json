Mr Hands' Terra Firma investment group is looking to form a consortium with other private equity groups. As the price tag for Thames Water is likely to be more than \u00a38bn, a successful bid would be the UK's biggest private equity deal so far. Sources close to Mr Hands said yesterday that talk of an imminent offer were premature as RWE's advisers, Goldman Sachs, had yet to issue full details of Thames Water's financial position and no due diligence had been undertaken."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
