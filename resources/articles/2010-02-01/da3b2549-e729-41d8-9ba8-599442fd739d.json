Having last week faced Portsmouth, Cardiff City and Southend United in the winding-up courts as it gets tough over unpaid taxes and taken on Milan Mandaric, Peter Storrie and Harry Redknapp over alleged evasion, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs is now pursuing more than half of the clubs in the Premier League over tax due on image rights payments totalling \u00a360m. The stand-off between tax authorities and Premier League clubs, some operating on a fiscal tightrope, is set to intensify after it emerged that they were unlikely to reach agreement on a collective deal. Discussions between representatives of all 20 top-flight clubs, led by the Premier League's finance director Javed Khan, explored whether they could agree a structure of payments to satisfy demands from HMRC over claims for up to \u00a360m in unpaid taxes and devise a workable ongoing solution. HMRC officials have already agreed a deal with rugby union for the professional game to pay a percentage of its image rights fees directly to the taxman in settlement, but it is believed that a similar deal is highly unlikely within football because of the complexities involved. Amid all the dissection of Manchester United's recent \u00a3504m bond issue, the club's ongoing dispute with HMRC over \u00a35.3m in outstanding tax and national insurance was largely overlooked. The prospectus said the Revenue's view was that \"image rights may be a form of remuneration and, as such, should be taxed as income\". The club, which under the Glazer family's ownership has been increasingly focused on maximising the revenue-generating potential of its best known players overseas, disputes that view. The to and fro with the taxman goes back more than a decade to a landmark case involving Arsenal players, which the Revenue lost, but has intensified in recent years as public finances have come under pressure. The extent to which public sentiment has swung away from apparently reckless football clubs may also be a factor. When the Premier League boom began, with the attendant explosion in revenues and influx of foreign players, some began to demand separate payments in order to license their individual image rights, which would typically be free of PAYE and national insurance and often channelled through an offshore company. Eric Cantona was among the first of the high-profile imports to recognise the commercial value of his individual image rights. It soon became a standard part of contract negotiations, with most players able to argue that the club benefited from their image in some way \u2013 even if only by selling shirts with their names on the back. Now, almost every Premier League contract of any substance will have an image rights clause. It recently emerged in court that Wayne Rooney earned \u00a3760,000 a year for his image rights via two separate annual payments. Experienced agents say that the concept was invented for good reason, and remained legitimate, but conceded it had been exploited by some clubs and players. The argument is less about the eminently marketable likes of Rooney, more about squad players in mid-table teams who are typically paid around 10% of their salary for their image rights. The clubs argue that the payments are wholly legitimate licensing payments. But the Revenue suspects that in some cases image rights contracts have simply become a standard top-up to an employment contract and in others are simply a means to an end to allow them to dangle a bigger net-earnings carrot in front of a transfer target. With Spain, Italy and France all having more advantageous tax regimes for overseas players \u2013 particularly since the new 50% tax rate was announced in the UK \u2013 clubs have also looked to every possible avenue to maximise their appeal. A spokesman for HMRC said it could not comment on individual cases but added: \"The government remains committed to ensuring that everyone pays their fair share of tax and that the minority who seek not to do so should not succeed.\" It said the onus was on any business to clear any transactions over which there was any \"uncertainty\" with HMRC. Rather than going after individual contracts, in 2006 the Revenue decided to take a more structured approach. It discovered that many image rights deals were based on games played or goals scored, clearly linking them with the players' employment contracts. Investigators examine correspondence between players, agents, clubs and accountants in order to try to prove the link. HMRC set up a specific unit to investigate and negotiate settlements with clubs. Anecdotal stories abound of players and their agents agreeing a contract and then, at the last minute, demanding an extra annual image rights payment on top. The onus is now on clubs to prove that image rights are of real value and are exploited as such. That could leave smaller Premier League clubs such as Wigan Athletic, who last year confirmed in their accounts that HMRC was investigating the issue, more exposed than those at the top end. At least half of Premier League clubs are now thought to be under investigation. A Premier League spokesman confirmed that it was continuing to try to broker a deal. \"Discussions are ongoing with HMRC to try to reach a mutually acceptable position. Both sides agree that it is acceptable for the assignment of a proportion of income to image rights, however the question is how best to decide what is a reasonable level across a multitude of varying contracts and levels of player.\" But tax experts are sceptical that the Premier League will be able to come up with a solution that suits the Revenue. If it cannot, individual clubs will have to resume their own negotiations. \"They won't do a percentage deal across the board, I could never see HMRC agreeing to that. Within a club they might have two image rights deals that are commercial and a number that aren't, so it is not possible to enter into a percentage deal,\" said Jeff Millington, a senior tax adviser at BTG Tax and a former manager at the Revenue, one of two who originally instigated its investigation into image rights. \"There is a precedent that a club can acquire the image rights of a player through an image rights contract for the purpose of exploiting that image. But it's got to be for commercial reasons and you've got to look at each specific one to make sure it's commercial and the club has tried to exploit it. I'd be amazed if the HMRC agreed to talks. It flies in the face of everything the Revenue is trying to achieve.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
