Magnus, who Pipe bid \u00a3340,000 for at the Goffs France Sale last month, makes his first public appearance this side of the Channel for his new owner David Johnson. Pipe easily broke the previous record for a jumps purchase when snapping up Magnus, who has at least repaid some of his staggering purchase price with a subsequent victory in a \u00a348,000 race at Auteuil. One of the most fascinating aspects of the gelding's new career will be what route he takes this campaign - he has already been quoted as favourite for the Arkle Chase at the Cheltenham Festival in March but is also in the betting for the Champion Hurdle. Immediately Pipe bought Magnus the trainer was making very definite plans to send him over fences but despite Pipe reiterating that Magnus is not at home jumping British hurdles, Johnson has said Magnus may stay over timber this season if today's race - switched from Saturday's abandoned fixture at Cheltenham - goes according to plan. Magnus faces four rivals in the Relkeel Hurdle, including American hope Tres Touche, trained by Ricky Hendriks and due to be ridden by Englishman David Bentley. Montalcino looks the main danger to Magnus (12.30) on his best form but has been disappointing so far this term and the Pipe runner should get off to a winning start from his new quarters. Pipe starts the meeting with a promising hurdles debutant in the shape of Riyadh (12.00) who looks just the sort to make an impact in juvenile contests with the Triumph Hurdle at Cheltenham as an obvious target. Pipe is renowned for his ability to bring about significant improvement with horses he switches from Flat racing to hurdles and Riyadh's victory in a Class C Newmarket race last time out on the level suggests he should be well up to winning at this level over hurdles. The Bula Hurdle is the other race to be switched to this fixture from the lost Cheltenham card and that man Pipe can come up trumps again with Valiramix (1.30) who can hold off the unpredictable Hors La Loi III. The Pipe trio are likely to go off at short odds and the nap bet is at Bangor where Emperor's Magic (3.10) looks worth backing to follow up his comfortable success at Catterick earlier this month. Sandown's prestigious Finale meeting in April is to be the centrepiece of a new \u00a32m marketing deal between attheraces and Britain's 'Super 12' racecourses. The initiative marks the end of a 45-year association between Sandown and brewing giants Whitbread, the former sponsors of the feature Gold Cup event. The two-day fixture will be re-launched by Sandown, with the support of Channel 4, as the attheraces Gold Cup Celebration Meeting. Comprising Channel 4, BSkyB and Arena Leisure, the attheraces consortium secured the media rights of 49 British racecourses earlier this year in a \u00a3307m deal. The new contract will ensure an extensive level of exposure for attheraces at all 12 of the elite British racecourses until January 31, 2003 and includes the branding of starting stalls and stalls-handlers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
