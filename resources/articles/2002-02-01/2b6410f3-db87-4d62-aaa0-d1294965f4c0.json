The flanker failed a fitness test last Friday, and his absence was sorely felt as Sale managed their first victory here in league rugby. \"He's highly unlikely to play for Scotland [in Rome],\" added Phil Pask, the Northampton and England physio. \"He may not join them this week as he's got to rehabilitate the injury for another four or five days, so he won't be able to train with any power or pace. He's upset and disappointed, as he was just getting into a run of form after his shoulder injury.\" That injury caused Pountney to miss Scotland's autumn internationals but his current problem is less serious, and he is expected to return for the east Midlands derby against Leicester at Welford Road on February 23. The Sale wing Mark Cueto was fast-tracked last week into the England squad but he limped off with a hip and back injury after half an hour and he did not expect to train with England today. The 22-year-old collided with his team-mate Kevin Yates as they tried to prevent the Saints prop Tom Smith from powering over to give the home side the lead just before the half hour came up. He is likely to be out for a fortnight. England's backs coach Brian Ashton was watching from the stand, but there was little for him to savour in an encounter riddled with handling errors and dominated by a forward battle in which Sale, unexpectedly, were the decisive winners. Cueto touched the ball only once before he limped off, and that contribution was a fumbled catch under a difficult high ball in the swirling wind. Jason Robinson continued his experiment at outside centre, where he started for only the second time this season, but according to Sale's director of rugby Jim Mallinder, he will not stay in the position much longer. Robinson twice danced through the first line of the Saints' defence early on, but was then moved to the wing after Jos Baxendell came on to replace Cueto, and received some thundering tackles from the Northampton centre Peter Jorgensen. His try, which put Sale back in the match 10 minutes after half-time, was a close-range run-in after the Ireland A centre Mel Deane made the breakthrough. If Deane's ability to break the Northampton line was outstanding, so too was the control shown by Charlie Hodgson, Jonny Wilkinson's understudy in the England No10 jersey. With his forwards wresting the ball at will off an off-colour Saints pack, Hodgson ran the second half, continually pegging the home side back with pin-point kicking from hand, while he landed four penalties and a drop-goal in difficult conditions. Sale have travelled well this season. This was their fifth league win on the road, and it took them above London Irish to third place in the table. Northampton, on the other hand, were left pondering an abrupt end to the run of form which coincided with Smith's arrival. Northampton looked aimless, running penalties when they could have kicked at goal, and Smith admitted that their shambolic line-out would be haunting him in his sleep. The new England hooker Steve Thompson missed his first three throws, and it was downhill from there. The Saints visit to the champions in 12 days now has a daunting look about it.
