David Hughes, 37, a surgeon lieutenant commander who had been working for up to 85 hours a week, had not been seen since he finished a night shift at St John's Hospital in Livingston, Lothian, at 9am last Wednesday. His wife Joanne said yesterday she feared the strain of her husband's workload had driven him to the brink of collapse. She said he had recently been told he would be sent to work in Basra from January. Last night Lothian and Borders police said a body had been found inside a tent at around 7.30pm during a search in the Scottish Highlands. Dr Hughes was understood to have had a green one-person tent with him when he went walking seven days ago. A police spokesman said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the discovery of the body. Formal identification and a postmortem are expected to take place today. Dr Hughes, who police said had been due to become a consultant at the end of this year, had been on secondment as an anaesthetist at St John's hospital in Livingston, West Lothian, as part of an armed forces programme. He started there in February and was said to have been feeling depressed about his work. Mrs Hughes said her husband had been left \"shattered\" by being expected to work 55-85 hours a week, and could even be asked to work up to 100 hours. Not being able to spend time with his three young children had been making the devoted family man miserable, she said. He had served for three months on the hospital ship RFA Argus in 2003 in Iraq, and had recently heard he would be required to return to Iraq next year. A spokesman for Lothian and Borders police said further examination and tests were needed to identify the body found. \"Tragically, with the discovery of David Hughes' car nearby we believe it is likely to be him,\" he added. \"The family are naturally devastated at this turn of events.\" Grampian police dispatched a search and rescue team and a police helicopter to examine the area earlier yesterday after they discovered Mr Hughes' silver Mondeo estate in a car park at Linn of Quoich, Braemar. The body was found about five miles from the car park at Linn of Quioch about four and a half hours after the car had been discovered. Dr Hughes, an experienced hill walker with training in outdoor survival, tele-phoned his wife to tell her he planned to go walking on Wednesday morning. He did not tell her where he was but the call was traced to Perthshire. Mrs Hughes, 34, said she tried to persuade him to come home to sleep and eat, but he resisted, saying that he had a tent with him. A few hours later he sent her a text message. \"I'm just going to stay out,\" Dr Hughes said in his text. \"I've got a tent. Give the children a kiss and a big hug from me.\" Before the body was found last night, Mrs Hughes wept as she told a press conference in Edinburgh, where the family lives: \"David is a great doctor. He takes great pride in his work. But he was finding the increasing hours of the job hard to cope with. \"He was left with no time to spend with his family, or to do anything else that he loved. He had no energy. He would come home and just flop on the sofa. He usually left in the morning while the children were still in bed and by the time he got back in the evening they would just be going to bed. Not seeing his family was really getting him down.\" She added: \"I really do feel he had reached the end.\" In the past four years the family had been forced to move around the country and to New Zealand as he was given one temporary hospital post after another. Jim McCaffery, director of human resources at NHS Lothian, said: \"Dr Hughes was part of a junior doctor rota that was recently monitored as being 48 hours a week, in line with the European working time directive and the New Deal for doctors.\" Mrs Hughes said that while her husband had accepted that his hours would be erratic as he worked towards becoming a hospital consultant, in recent weeks he appeared to be working harder than ever. Earlier appealing for him to get in touch if he was able, she said: \"I know you are fed up with the armed services and I know you are fed up with the hospital rota, and I know you are fed up with working. But the children are missing you horribly. They are asking where you are and I don't know what to say.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
