The foreign secretary has confirmed that he has ordered his department not to provide any official or consular support for Sturgeon\u2019s trips abroad if she uses them to campaign for Scottish independence. The row first erupted when the FCO refused to support Sturgeon\u2019s trip to Brussels to meet Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, and Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, two weeks ago. The first minister gave a speech attacking Brexit and extolling her government\u2019s pro-EU, pro-independence stance. Hunt has told the Scottish Daily Mail during a leadership campaign visit to Scotland that the policy would affect Sturgeon\u2019s future tours and visits, although he indicated it would apply primarily if Scotland\u2019s constitutional future was on the agenda. \u201cI believe in the union with every fibre of my being and British government policy is to protect, preserve, cherish and enhance that union,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cSo we are not going to offer support to Nicola Sturgeon if she goes abroad to drum up support for independence.\u201d Sturgeon\u2019s official spokesman said it was extraordinary for a candidate for prime minister to withdraw support offered to every devolved administration and minister, while at the same time claiming to be protecting the UK as whole. Hunt\u2019s stance was \u201cthe most visible way possible of making the arguments for independence\u201d. \u201cIt is entirely legitimate for the democratically elected first minister to espouse the views that she was democratically elected on,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cShe is not going to take a vow of silence when [the media] ask her about independence.\u201d He added: \u201cIt would be naive to think this was nothing to do with the Tory leadership race.\u201d Sturgeon\u2019s trip to Brussels was not directly affected because the Scottish government has its own external affairs office in the Belgian capital, he said; it would be considered much more serious if the policy affected future trips to other countries. She has been on FCO-supported trade visits to China, the US, Canada and other countries, frequently collaborating with Scottish universities, as well as technology and whisky companies and other business bodies. However, on trips to Brussels, Dublin and North America she has given speeches and media interviews that focused heavily on her government\u2019s objections to Brexit and her quest for independence, including plans to potentially rejoin the EU in future. \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see exactly how official or otherwise this is, or if this is a flash-in-the-pan leadership pitch from Jeremy Hunt which fizzles out. The jury is out on that one,\u201d her spokesman said. \u201cLonger term, of course we would be concerned if the Scottish government was not to be afforded the same level of representation as the rest of the UK.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
