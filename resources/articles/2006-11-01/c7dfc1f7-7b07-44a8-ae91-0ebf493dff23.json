Hearing the Amadeus Quartet playing Schubert in the 1970s or the Borodin Quartet in Shostakovich a decade later was unforgettable, and there can be no higher praise for the way the current Takacs Quartet plays Beethoven - or Bartok or Mozart for that matter - than to say that its performances rank alongside those of such great groups. A year ago, the Takacs became associate artists of the South Bank Centre - a real coup for the SBC, even if it passed almost unremarked at the time. The quartet is giving three concerts in the Queen Elizabeth Hall this season, and the main work in the first of them was Beethoven's A minor Quartet Op 132. Anyone who has heard the Takacs recordings of the late Beethoven quartets issued last year would have expected the overwhelming technical assurance and concentration with which Op 132 was projected here, but not perhaps the fluency of the performance, in which every section and detail were perfectly dovetailed so that the arching structure, with the great hymn of thanksgiving as its sublime centrepiece, was all of a single, seamless piece. The performances of Bartok's Sixth Quartet and Mozart's D minor K421 beforehand were equally remarkable. The Bartok was played with less of a sardonic edge than some interpreters bring to the music, as if its overall melancholy had blunted the anger of its central movements. The Mozart, meanwhile, was a joyous demonstration of chamber-music playing at its best, with each member of the group involved in the musical decision-making, and listening intently to everything that their outstanding colleagues had to say. \u00b7 At the John Innes Centre, Norwich (01603 628319) tonight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
