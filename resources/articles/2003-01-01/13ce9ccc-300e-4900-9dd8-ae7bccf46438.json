We've been invited to a family wedding in Tirana. Do you have safety and travel tips, and can you suggest highlights of the country? Sue and Derek Whitehouse, Shrewsbury Albania is showing signs of emerging from isolation. Tirana, the capital, is a lively and pleasant city with huge communist-era palaces and squares. Elsewhere, there are great classical ruins at Apollonia and Durres, and scenic 'museum towns' such as Berat and Gjirokastra. Generally the country is safe, especially if you're travelling with locals. But the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (020 7008 0232; www.fco.gov.uk) advises against visiting the north-east border with Kosovo, and also suggests travelling during the day. Independent travel is possible and major cities are well linked by bus. Flights from the UK to Albania generally start at around \u00a3300 return. Packages are available through Regent Holidays (0117 921 1711; www.regent-holidays.co.uk) from \u00a3363. Some English is spoken, but a few phrases of Albanian will impress your hosts. In Your Pocket (www.inyourpocket.com) has extensive listings, including accommodation. \u00b7 We're travelling to Australia next May for a wedding. We'd like to spend a few days in Brisbane and a few days in Sydney (and maybe Melbourne). We're also keen to take in a more 'idyllic' spot, for some R&amp;R and diving. The French Polynesian islands look fabulous but can we fit them into our itinerary? We'll be away three weeks in total. S &amp; R Joplin, by email Almost anywhere in the South Pacific will offer gorgeous beaches and world-class diving. STA (www.sta-travel.co.uk; 0870 1 600 599) offers an around-the-world ticket for about \u00a3850 which allows for stops in Australia, Fiji and either Tahiti or the Cook Islands. In Fiji, I recommend leaving Nadi immediately and heading for one of the smaller islands. Castaway Island (www.castawayfiji.com), in the Mamanucas, is one luxury option. Bures (wood and thatch bungalows) on the beach cost about \u00a3150 per night and activities (apart from diving) are included. Alternatively, try the more remote Yasawas for budget accommodation. Wayalailai Resort (www.bbr.ca/wayalailai/) is 100 per cent Fijian-owned. Bures are about \u00a330 per night. The islands of Tahiti and French Polynesia are also beautiful. Air Tahiti (www.airtahiti-vt.com) does a basic air pass for about \u00a3100. Raiatea is less touristy than its neighbours and specialises in diving. Raiatea Pearl Resort Hawaiki Nui (southpacificvacation.com/pearl_resort_ hawaiki.html) has bungalows for about \u00a3100 per night. In the Cook Islands there is no need to go farther than Raratonga. Check out www.cook-islands.com for accommodation options. \u00b7 For my 50th birthday, I want to climb Kilimanjaro with my sons. I have found a company that will guide and porter us, and this takes seven days. While I'm trying to keep up with the kids, is there anything my wife can safely do on her own? Also, how do I get there and where can we all stay at reasonable cost? Paul Carter, Leicester Apart from climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, there are two things you ought to do while in Tanzania: take a safari, and visit Zanzibar for a beach holiday, either of which your wife could safely do on her own. For the former, you could fly as a family to Kilimanjaro International Airport - KLM (www.klm.com) offers flights for about \u00a3620 - then base yourselves in Arusha. Palm Inn (00 2 55 27 250 7430) has clean, good-value rooms, doubles are \u00a38 per night. From here your wife could do a week-long safari in the Serengeti, or the less well-known Lake Manyara National Park. See www.tanzania-web.com/home2.htm for a range of safari companies. If your wife prefers the latter option, it might be better for you all to fly to Dar es Salaam and then go your separate ways. Gulf Air (www.gulfairco.com) has flights for \u00a3450. Precision Air (www.precisionairtz.com) then has flights to Zanzibar for about \u00a370 return and to Kilimanjaro for about \u00a3200 return. Once on the island, your wife could spend a few days exploring Stone Town and then head to Breezes Beach Club (www.tanzania-web.com/zanzibar/breezes.htm) for some rest, relaxation and diving. \u00b7 We welcome letters.
