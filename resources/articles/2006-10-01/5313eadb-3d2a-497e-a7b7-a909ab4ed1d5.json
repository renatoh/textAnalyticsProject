Standard treatments - gagging and tongue-pulling manoeuvres, pressing the eyeball, swallowing a teaspoon of granulated sugar, even strong drugs - do not terminate the hiccups. What to do? Francis M Fesmire, of the University of Tennessee college of medicine, who treated a case like this, came up with the solution: digital rectal massage. As a non-native speaker of English, when I first heard about this I thought the doctor had invented some digital device, but after reading his paper in the Annals of Emergency Medicine, I understood the simplicity of this treatment. For his report of this case Fesmire has won the 2006 Ig Nobel medicine prize, the award that honours achievements that \"first make you laugh and then make you think\". In his acceptance speech he confessed that, after hearing news of his achievement from the awards' organiser (and Education Guardian columnist), Marc Abrahams, he almost booked a flight to Stockholm, but then realised \"it was another kind of prize\". Sixty-second wonders Nine more Ig Nobel prizes were awarded last Thursday in Sanders Theatre, Harvard. Almost all winners travelled to Cambridge, Massachusetts - at their own expense - to receive their prize and give an acceptance speech (of 60 seconds). Winners and the 1,200 spectators had a memorable night. The ceremony featured a real mini-opera called Inertia Makes the World Go Round and numerous other tributes to the evening's theme of \"Inertia\". Foremost were the 24/7 lectures, in which famous thinkers explained their field of research, first in 24 seconds, and then in seven words. Benoit Mandelbrot, the inventor of fractal geometry, and Irene Pepperberg, who teaches parrots and humans to communicate, headed the list. No fewer than seven real Nobel laureates were on stage to present prizes. Most winners did not really understand what was happening to them, and probably have no idea what the Ig Nobel prize may bring to them. As a past winner myself - I got the 2003 biology prize for scientifically documenting the first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard duck - I have first-hand experience. My life has changed quite a bit as a result. People think I am a specialist in peculiar bird behaviour and send me all kinds of amazing observations. And this spring, I became chief of the so-called European Bureau, the first-and-only overseas branch of Improbable Research, the US-based organisation that publishes the science humour magazine Annals of Improbable Research and organises the Ig Nobel prizes. The bureau is housed in (a drawer in) my office at the Natural History Museum, Rotterdam, and has quickly become Europe's central collecting point for improbable research and Ig Nobel nominations. The museum - besides being a venue for good natural history exhibitions - now also serves as a place where Ig Nobel prize winners and their fans can drop by and have a cup of coffee. Europe was well represented among this year's winners. Howard Stapleton, of Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, was awarded the Ig Nobel peace prize for inventing an electromechanical teenager repellent - a device that makes an annoying noise audible to teenagers but not adults; and for later using that same technology to make mobile ringtones that are audible to teenagers but not their teachers. Stapleton, who created the so-called \"Mosquito\" in his shed and has sold 2,500 so far, was unable to attend the ceremony. The physics prize went to Basile Audoly and Sebastien Neukirch, of the Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, for a piece of research into the problem of why, when you bend dry spaghetti, it often breaks into more than two pieces. The answer is not that simple, but if you are curious, take a look at Physical Review Letters 95 of August 26, 2005 and all will become clear. Another piece of down-to-earth research called \"Ultrasonic velocity in cheddar cheese as affected by temperature\" was done by Antonio Mulet, Jos\u00e9 Javier Benedito and Jos\u00e9 Bon of the University of Valencia, and Carmen Rossell\u00f3 of the University of Illes Balears, in Palma de Mallorca, and published in the prestigious Journal of Food Science. These Spanish scientists won this year's chemistry prize. Bart Knols and Ruurd de Jong of Wageningen University, the Netherlands, won the biology prize for showing the female malaria mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) is attracted equally to the smell of Limburger cheese and the smell of human feet. Human foot odour After the ceremony, Knols told me the background of his remarkable study. He wanted to know what part of the naked human body the malaria mosquito prefers to bite. His wife volunteered, and the curious researcher found a strong preference for the ankles and feet. For further experiments he sought a substance with a smell that resembles human foot odour. \"I asked my local cheese shop, and they presented several kinds of cheese that qualified perfectly. I chose Limburger because I was born in that part of the Netherlands.\" The secret of the odour resemblance lies in the bacteria used in the production of the cheese. These micro-organisms probably originate from the sour-humid environment between the toes of the monks who used to produce the cheese barefoot. Two biologists from Kuwait, Wasmia al-Houty and Faten al-Mussalam, won the nutrition prize, for showing that dung beetles are finicky eaters. They presented their beetles a choice of sheep, camel, horse, fox and dog excrement, and found a strong preference to the more fluid horse dung, whereas the dung of both carnivores were hardly touched. Mussalam, accompanied by her daughter, proudly accepted the prize and said follow-up studies were on the way. The winner of the medicine prize, Francis Fesmire, had a present for us all: Dr Fran's Anti-Hiccup Kit, containing his picture, a latex surgical glove, a tube of jelly and directions. \"If, after five minutes, hiccups persist, insert two fingers into friend's or family member's rectum and massage with a slow circumferential motion, counterclockwise in direction.\" The European Bureau of Improbable Research has some of Fesmire's kits available.
