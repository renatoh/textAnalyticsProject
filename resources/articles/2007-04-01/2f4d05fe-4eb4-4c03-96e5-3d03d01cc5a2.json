How else would they be aware of singer-songwriter Jack Pe\u00f1ate (\"Walked straight past Pe\u00f1ate and his public-school rock'n'roll crew\"), whose only release before this week was a limited-edition vinyl single at the end of 2006? His reach so far seems to be limited to the LDNers, whose just-so jeans give the sold-out gig the smell of an event where you have to know someone to get in. The mystery is why this crew has embraced the unpretentious Pe\u00f1ate, whose puppyish zeal would stand him in great stead if he ever auditioned for the X-Factor. It is only natural that his genre should be rockabilly, which coats even the stormiest lyrics in toe-tapping twanginess. Not that Pe\u00f1ate appears to have hit much stormy weather in his 22 years. There is a diversion into glumness on Second, Minute or Hour, but what is striking about the song is not the \"She never wanted me-eee\" refrain but the Eddie Cochran drawl Pe\u00f1ate produces. This is one of several vocal devices he employs. He is most comfortable with a kind of startled yap, which suits the skiffle tempo of new single Spit at Stars, but a not-bad falsetto pops out for a cover of Beats International's Dub be Good to Me. Delivered with uniform gusto, his various styles cement the impression of a man who enjoys his work. \u00b7 At University of London Union on Saturday.
