Local reports indicated that the hostages were a 25-year-old human rights worker and her visiting parents, and said they had been snatched in the town of Rafah. \"We are in a position to confirm reports of three Britons missing in the occupied territories ... at this stage, we have no further details,\" a Foreign Office spokesman said. It was reported that the woman worked at the Al Mezan Centre for Human Rights. It was said the three Britons had been travelling in a car 200 yards away from the border crossing when they were approached by gunmen in a white Mercedes. They were bundled into the attackers' car and driven off at high speed. The Mercedes was pursued by a security vehicle, but got away. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Palestinian police said the kidnappers' car had been seen heading north and that the Britons were kidnapped at around 4pm local time (1400 GMT). It is the latest in a series of abductions in Gaza that has undermined attempts by the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, to establish order in the coastal strip following Israel's withdrawal earlier this year. Militant groups have kidnapped a number of foreigners, usually using them as bargaining chips to get relatives released from Palestinian prisons, secure jobs from the Palestinian Authority or settle personal scores. Last week, two foreign teachers were kidnapped by Palestinian militants near Gaza City. Gunmen abducted Hendrik Taatgen, a Dutch headteacher at a private American school, and his Australian deputy, Brian Ambrosio, as they left for work. The abductors - who claimed to have ties to the radical PLO faction the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - demanded the release of an imprisoned militant leader. They later released the captives unharmed. Following the kidnap, the Foreign Office \"strongly advised\" British citizens against all travel to the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, the German foreign ministry confirmed that a former foreign minister, Juergen Chrobog, and four members of his family were missing in Yemen after reports that they had been kidnapped by armed tribesmen. Mr Chrobog had been a junior minister in the government of the former chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, and was previously Germany's ambassador to the US. The tribesmen were thought to have seized the family in al-Irim, in Shabwa province, in an attempt to force the government to release detained members of their tribe. Officials said the kidnappers belonged to the al-Abdullah bin Dahha tribe, a number of whose members were arrested after a clash with another tribe two months ago. Tribesmen occasionally kidnap westerners in Yemen, often to try to force concessions from the government. Hostages are usually released unharmed, but several were killed in 2000 when security forces bungled an attempted raid to free them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
