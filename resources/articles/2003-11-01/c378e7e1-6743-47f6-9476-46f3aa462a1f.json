They have been compared to Eric and Ernie, Vladimir and Estragon, Philip Larkin and Peter Lorre, although their own choice is Cunt and Shit, the title of a photographic self-portrait for 1969. It is a typical work: direct, confrontational, calmly filthy, egocentric. Yet since the pair first courted attention by posing as statues outside a landmark London show in 1968, they have become avuncular icons of the art scene. Their peculiarly British strain of humour makes them hard to despise (their work Eight Shits depicts six turds and themselves). Shortlisted for the Turner in 1984 they won it two years later, on the back of brightly coloured photomontages that juggle heads, profanities, flowers, turds, streets and so on. It was a brief moment of glory in what the artists regard as lifelong neglect by the UK art establishment. Despite the fact that they can be found in the Yellow Pages (under \"artists\") and people often approach them in the street, they claim not to have sold a piece in England in 10 years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
