Mateusz Banasiuk is Kuba, a promising athlete locked into a daily routine of training and trying to keep the peace at home between his doting girlfriend and possessive, inappropriate mum. The appearance of the cabinet-jawed Michal (Bartosz Gelner) forces him to reassess where his loyalties lie. Wasilewski leads us into a perfect storm of domestic anguish, towards a climax as bleak as the deserted industrial spaces that form the backdrop. Put it this way, Poland's \"first LGBT film\" doesn't award the country top marks for tolerance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
