Of 200 overseas students surveyed, 46% of non-EU nationals said they would be less likely to choose a university in an independent Scotland because they wanted a British degree. More than a third feared the reputation of a Scottish degree would decline. The survey was carried out by Chinese students at four Scottish universities: Glasgow, Strathclyde, Edinburgh and Glasgow Caledonian. The four institutions are at the forefront of a drive to increase income from overseas students, partly to offset tight restrictions on Scottish government funding after the introduction of free tuition for EU nationals. The survey of students from 36 countries was overseen by Yajun Deng, editor of the online student magazine ChinaGirlsAbroad. She said a loss of overseas income, estimated to be worth \u00a3778m a year, could cause significant problems for Scottish universities funding. While almost 50% of respondents said independence would not have affected their decision to go to a Scottish university, only a minority had any overriding loyalty to Scotland as a place, she said. Some students spoke about the importance of \"brand UK\" in their responses. An economics graduate from the University of Glasgow, Deng said this split in her survey was similar to that among Scottish voters on independence. But she added: \"The key difference with international students is that they are intensely mobile. They can alter their application for a course or for a different country, with a simple click on a computer. So the effects of independence would be felt almost immediately by universities.\" The survey found 45% of the 132 Chinese students questioned would be less likely to choose a Scottish university after independence, largely because UK degrees were seen as more valued. A third of the 20 EU students questioned said they would reconsider even though they would have theoretically still received free tuition. A Scottish government spokeswoman said the sector had a global reputation for quality \u2013 with five universities in the world's top 200 and with 22% entrants for Scottish universities from overseas, compared with 18% for the UK as a whole. David Caldwell, former director of the umbrella body Universities Scotland and a senior figure in the pro-UK Academics Together referendum campaign, said he was doubtful that overseas student numbers would fall by 40% after a yes vote but that the survey pointed to a potential issue. \"I'm perfectly sure it is genuinely the case that Scottish universities benefit from both being able to stress their specific characteristics and that they are an integral part of the UK,\" he said. \"That does reassure international students who might otherwise be more cautious and more inclined to go for places in England. [They are] highly mobile and its extremely easy for them to alter their choices.\" He added that a Scottish government would market \"brand Scotland\" and its universities hard after independence. The survey findings follow a protracted dispute over the Scottish government's claims that its free tuition fees system, under which students from the rest of the UK and non-EU students are currently charged full fees, would survive after independence under EU law. While free tuition would be legal in principle, European commission officials have said that free tuition would have to be given to students from the rest of the UK after independence too, raising significant doubts about its affordability."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
