Audio cassette tape The tape was done by my sister-in-law, who died of cancer last year. When I started this agency, I went on BBC Radio York and she recorded it. It reminds me how special she was, and also that it was my first foray into the media, and how much further I've got to go. Bubble liquid When things get a bit tough, I blow bubbles. It's like all your troubles are flying away, and it makes you regress to being a child. You can imagine all of your problems popping like the bubbles. Blank cards When I do an introduction, and people meet, they often have no idea what the other looks like.

CDs One CD contains an advert I did on Minster FM, and another contains photos of me that I have to use for brochures and publicity materials. Letterheads I use letterheads to send out letters to my clients. I like adding the personal touch. I meet everyone who comes in and I interview them. I'm very specific about matching people's ideals. If one person plays squash regularly for example, it makes sense to introduce them to someone who's also very physical. \u00b7 Lesley Brewer, who runs The Introduction Company - a dating agency for professionals - was talking to Ravi Somaiya"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
