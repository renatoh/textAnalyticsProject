Imagine trying to keep that lot happy. A resort may have the perfect toddlers' club, but the teenager will be bored; or the teenager will be happy with discos and free kitesurfing, but what you thought was a \"free\" kids' club isn't free for non-potty trained toddlers who require their own nanny - at \u20ac15 an hour! But ask all the right questions before you book, and you won't return seriously out of pocket or more stressed than when you left. Kids' clubs \u00b7 How much do kids' clubs cost? Often over threes or fours will be free, sometimes younger if they are potty trained; creches cost around \u00a3250 a week. Some clubs are only free outside school holidays. \u00b7 How flexible is the child care? Some clubs are six days minimum, which can be pricey. \u00b7 Do you have to pre-book? \u00b7 When are they open? Clubs for school age children usually operate in school holidays, when, annoyingly, some pre-schoolers' clubs are closed. \u00b7 Who's running them? Carers should be qualified nannies and checked out by the Criminal Records Bureau. \u00b7 Security: do parents sign children in and out? \u00b7 Do infants get a designated minder? \u00b7 Is there an indoor and outdoor play area; and is the outdoor area shaded? Babysitting \u00b7 Who's watching the baby? Qualified staff or local girls earning pocket money? \u00b7 Is there a minimum charge plus taxi fares home? \u00b7 Is there a free baby-listening service? Food \u00b7 Are kids' menus just chicken nuggets, pizza and burgers? Good resorts will do local food in kids' portions, and early sittings. Rooms \u00b7 How flexible is room sharing? Family prices are often geared around two adults, two kids and may charge a supplement to have an extra child sharing. Larger families might have to pay extra for family suites.
