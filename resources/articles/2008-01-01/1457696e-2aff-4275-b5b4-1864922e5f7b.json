She has come on considerably since her one real hit, the raspy 1988 single Stop! What she has lost in youthful brio, she's gained in velvety maturity, and her early work just isn't in the same league as the 11 contemplative songs that make up Of the Moment. Having outgrown the idea that a song isn't worth the name unless it has the velocity of a torpedo, she's soft and allusive here, lighting the music from within with a candle-lit croon. Mandolin and ukulele feature heavily, and, on the closing Away with the Faeries, enchantingly. Lyrically it's less impressive - there's a new boyfriend; she's in raptures - but it's excusable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
