There has, though, been another one of sorts; the controlling of emotions in the midst of golf\u2019s most frustrating environment. It was not always thus. McIlroy turned to his caddie, JP Fitzgerald, when walking from the 18th green and remarked. \u201cThank God I have got one of these.\u201d The reference was to his 2011 US Open triumph. In his last two appearances at this event, McIlroy lies at an aggregate of 10 over par. He is 48 under for the five majors played around them, starting at the 2013 US PGA Championship. Talk about contrasting fortunes. The McIlroy klaxon had sounded after nine Saturday holes. He reached the turn in 33, moving to two over par and firmly in position for a tilt at glory having negotiated the toughest part of the course. What followed summed up the world No1\u2019s volatility. Almost without fail, it can be linked to performances on the greens. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to stay patient whenever I\u2019m not holing anything,\u201d the 26-year-old said. \u201cI feel mentally I\u2019ve accepted most things this week, which is good.\u201d The precise run went something like this: simple birdie chance that lips out on the 10th, three-putt on 11, missed birdie opportunities at the 12th, 13th and 14th. McIlroy failed to save par at the 15th, moving him back to the four over score he started the round at. Birdie putts at 16 and 17? Say no more. \u201cI\u2019m just in a bad habit of turning good scores into average ones at the minute and that\u2019s why I\u2019m in the position I\u2019m in,\u201d admitted the Northern Irishman. \u201cI would say that the putt on 10 was the real momentum stopper. I hit it really close there. That\u2019s a pin position where if you get it within 20ft of the hole, you are going to be happy. To get it within 3ft and miss that, it sort of stopped any momentum that I had. \u201cOn those three holes I let a few shots slip and couldn\u2019t recover, even though I gave myself plenty of chances on the way in after that.\u201d The mitigating circumstance relates to course condition. Players have lined up to castigate the greens at Chambers Bay, with Henrik Stenson memorably likening them to broccoli. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re as green as broccoli,\u201d said McIlroy with a smile. \u201cI think they\u2019re more like cauliflower. Look, they are what they are, everyone has to putt on them. \u201cIt\u2019s all mental. Some guys embrace it more than others, and that\u2019s really the way it is. It is disappointing that they\u2019re not in a bit better shape.\u201d Sergio Garc\u00eda signed for a third round of 70 and offered his own analogy. \u201cTo me, this is like playing the NBA Finals on a court with holes and slopes and no backboards,\u201d said the Spaniard and Miami Heat fan. There was a clear counter-point to this rising level of complaint. Jordan Spieth, arguably the finest putter in the world, was coping perfectly well. That much was illustrated by back-to-back putts from 25ft on the 2nd and 3rd on Saturday. Jim Furyk also issued a defence of sorts on behalf of Chambers Bay. Furyk did not enjoy a particularly pleasant day three, carding 73 to move to seven over after 54 holes, but took exception to the suggestion that the quality of a leaderboard mirrors that of a venue. \u201cIf Tiger Woods wins when he\u2019s in his prime, then it\u2019s a reflection of a great course; and if a guy that\u2019s ranked 150th in the world wins, it\u2019s not,\u201d said Furyk. \u201cIt\u2019s a real slap in the face to a guy that might not be ranked that well but had a good week and played well.\u201d Ian Poulter\u2019s third round of 69 leaves him at plus four. Colin Montgomerie, who like Poulter made the cut by a single shot, added a 72 for seven over. Montgomerie\u2019s subsequent gripe related to gallery experience. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is fit for purpose,\u201d said the Scot of Chambers Bay. \u201cYou have to think of the spectators as well at $125 a round. My wife added up she saw 15 shots yesterday and they are from a long way away. It\u2019s not really a spectator-friendly course at all.\u201d The most epic volley of all arrived from someone who is not even competing. Gary Player, a nine-times major champion, took to television to brand the construction of Chambers Bay as a \u201ctragedy\u201d for amateur golf. \u201cAn average golfer playing this golf course? I\u2019m telling you, if he\u2019s a 15, 16-handicap, he\u2019s going to shoot 110 and he\u2019s not going to go home a very happy man,\u201d Player added. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make golf where it\u2019s quicker, where it\u2019s more enjoyable, get back to their family. We don\u2019t want a husband and wife to argue because he\u2019s taking too long and neglecting his family life.\u201d All Player had been asked was \u201cHow are you?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
