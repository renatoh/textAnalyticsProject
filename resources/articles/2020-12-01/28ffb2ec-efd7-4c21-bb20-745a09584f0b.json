Neither Fulham nor Brighton quite got going despite a brighter second half that allowed both to argue they might have won, but the abiding feeling was one of a non-event. Perhaps it was the renewed absence of supporters at a venue that had so gleefully welcomed them when Liverpool were held here on Sunday; either way the night seemed flat from the outset and these sides will need to muster more spark than this if the draw is to be of consequence come May. For now at least, it puts them outside the relegation zone. Fulham would have been left there if they had not emerged intact from the game\u2019s major incident, which came as Brighton attempted to turn the screw in a spell of concerted pressure straight after half-time. Adam Lallana, who had arrived to convert coolly after Danny Welbeck could not control Solly March\u2019s cross, thought he had scored his first goal for the club, but was denied with the players lining up to restart. A VAR check correctly found Welbeck had handled and Brighton were forced to dust themselves down. They did that and a few minutes later Adam Webster thudded a header against the underside of the crossbar. It was their final significant chance. Lewis Dunk had forced a parry from Alphonse Areola shortly before Lallana\u2019s frustration and during a tedious first half Welbeck had air-kicked Tariq Lamptey\u2019s centre when well placed. That was all as exciting as it got for the visitors, but Graham Potter was not of a mind to complain. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m disappointed, I\u2019m pleased with the performance of the players and what they gave,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was important to be stable and keep a clean sheet.\u201d That particular achievement owed something to Robert S\u00e1nchez, selected instead of Mat Ryan in goal for his second Premier League appearance. Ryan did not travel to London and Potter confirmed S\u00e1nchez will keep his place when Brighton host Sheffield United on Sunday. The keeper survived an early flutter with the ball at his feet to look the part, tipping over from Ivan Cavaleiro in Fulham\u2019s only real moment of pre-interval threat and then making important stops from Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Ademola Lookman as the clock ticked down. \u201cWe made the decision to go with Rob, he\u2019s got some incredible attributes and huge potential,\u201d Potter said. Scott Parker felt his players had \u201clacked a little something\u201d, perhaps in part due to the comedown from their lung-busting effort against the champions. Like Potter, he seemed especially happy not to have conceded and it was not the only similarity in the managers\u2019 reactions. \u201cIt was a fair result and we move on now,\u201d Parker said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard-fought point, we accept it and move forward to the weekend,\u201d Potter echoed. Contentment all round, then, but it was hard not to shake the sense this was a lost evening."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
