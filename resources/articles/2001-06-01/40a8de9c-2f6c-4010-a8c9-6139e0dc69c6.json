Her forthrightness paid off, and the sacked social security secretary returns to the fold as solicitor general. \"I think it will suit me,\" she said last night. \"It's interesting, I'll be my own boss, and it's out of the firing line.\" At social security she was charged with thinking the unthinkable but was fired amid clashes with fellow minister Frank Field (they thought each other unthinkable). But she stayed loyal and argued from the backbenches for improved childcare and work-life balance, nudging the chancellor on parental leave and maternity pay. Peter Hain The former Foreign Office minister of state's return with the Europe brief is a clear sign of Tony Blair's trust in the sometimes outspoken yet loyal and con structive minister, who takes one of the most important jobs outside cabinet. The MP for Neath, who voted against the Maastricht treaty, makes his way back from the Department of Trade and Industry to where he was transferred because of his wariness over \"son of star wars\". The prime minister wants to see Mr Hain network far more than his predecessors with other ministers on the continent, amid concerns that the job has still not been done properly by the Foreign Office. He will also be pushing other European governments towards structural reform. Lord Goldsmith The new attorney general is one of the circle of barristers close to Mr Blair and the Lord Irvine. One of his specialities has been human rights law and he was chairman of the Bar Council in 1995. A fluent French speaker, he acted as Mr Blair's personal envoy during the tortuous negotiations over the EU's charter of fundamental rights. Mr Blair feared that the charter would be legally enforceable. Mr Blair was impressed by how he used his command of detail to negotiate Britain's position and prevent the charter blighting talks at the Nice summit. Sally Morgan Mr Blair's political secretary is given a peerage and made cabinet office minister of state and women's minister in the Lords, though the move is confirmation that she lost the No 10 turf war with Anji Hunter, Mr Blair's special assistant. The two key women in the prime minister's team did not get on, but Ms Morgan, one of the few insiders in No 10 to have a strong history inside the party, could not be discarded. Ms Morgan will not leave No 10, but will stay on to work with Mr Blair in a newly-restructured Downing Street."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
