As far as I can tell, in the past half-century, there have been just nine of that persuasion to play Tests for England, of whom five never exceeded five matches - six until Sidebottom's renaissance. John Lever, 73 wickets in 21 matches, Allan Mullally, 58 in 19 and Jeff Jones, Simon's dad, with 44 from 15, are the only ones previously to reach double figures in that time. Bill Voce, Nottinghamshire's pre-war Bodyline express, is still the daddy of them all with 98 wickets in 27 matches. Given a fair wind and fitness, Sidebottom, with 53 wickets in 13 Tests, will sail past that. The player-of-the-year accolade that came his way at the Long Room at Lord's on Monday evening was a no-brainer. Sidebottom has been head, shoulders and flowing barnet above any other of England's players in the past year. He is endearingly modest but when the opposition start to talk of him, rather than Andrew Flintoff or Kevin Pietersen as the man to fear, he must know he stands at the highest echelons of the game. The Australian Nathan Bracken is a marvellously versatile one-day bowler, Mitchell Johnson is probably quicker, while Zaheer Khan has his days, but surely only Chaminda Vaas in his heyday can lay claim to matching Sidebottom, albeit in a relatively brief second coming, as the most compelling Test exponent of cack-handed pace since Wasim Akram lapsed his membership of the magic circle. Not bad for someone dismissed as a no-hoper when a lad, and later as a like-father-like-son one-Test wonder. What we have seen, though, is a triumph for the county game that nurtured him and a work ethic that made him knuckle down and forge a career around the shires until, first of all, the whispers started, and then someone of influence took notice. Those who played against him recognised a feisty competitor who had taken his old game, which largely involved falling away in delivery and firing the ball across right-handed batsmen, and rebuilding it so that the inswinger to the right-hander, from closer to the stumps became his stock ball. Freedom from the daily grind has allowed him to up his pace and keep it there so that batsmen can get only half forward now, knowing that a bouncer will keep them honest. He brings with the package honest aggression - though his first attempts at snarling were too falsely theatrical. Perhaps it's a family trait, for Arnie, his old man, all sinew, angles and knobbly bits when bowling, would colour up when he had a mog on, which was most of the time, so that he looked like a swan vesta. Ryan turns puce, too, but he is bigger - deceptively so at 6ft 4in - and bulkier, so it is more a nuclear reactor going critical. In part, too, his education has included the need to become, in a sense, an orthodox bowler. The nub of the left-armer's art has been that even those who gain movement neither in the air nor off the pitch have had an advantage simply by the angle created. The past decade, though, has seen the rise of the left-hand batsman, right-handed people for the most part who, partly through emulation, partly the absence of discouragement that once challenged anything out of the ordinary and partly through the realisation that strong top-hand dominance is perhaps a better way to play than bottom-hand shovelling, have increased rapidly in numbers. England, for example, go into tomorrow's first Test with a pair of left-handers opening, while Australia's most prolific pairing of Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer posed similar problems. With the likes of Sidebottom, the game increasingly becomes a mirror image of itself. There is something more, though. Pace bowlers have always been cricket's spear carriers, the equivalent, say, of rugby forwards. Yet within that, Sidebottom is an artisan's artisan, a blue-collar cricketer, the sort who if they had such things, would clock on at the ground to the sound of a hooter. The name suggests it, for sometimes you are as you sound. Once, in a school match, a scorebook entry against my name read \"st Slaughter b Lobb\" with no embellishment needed to describe delivery nor the carnage of the dismissal. Would an on-drive have seemed so aesthetically pleasing if struck by PBH Sidebottom? I think not. It is an earthy bowler's name. First Arnie, then Ryan. There is no next generation yet but when there is it won't involve a namby-pamby batsman, you can bet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
