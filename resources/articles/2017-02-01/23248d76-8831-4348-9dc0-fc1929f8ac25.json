The Australian said he cannot understand why England have won only 40% of their championship games on Welsh soil and wants to improve that \u201chorrendous\u201d ratio at the Principality Stadium. With both sides having kicked off the 2017 Six Nations with victories on the first weekend, Jones has been studying the historical stats and is baffled by his findings. \u201cI can\u2019t work out why the record of England in Wales is so poor,\u201d said the head coach. \u201cI\u2019m sure they have [had good teams in the past] but they are a country of three million people. There seems to be some sort of thing there. No one can tell me why the English are petrified of playing Wales in Wales. I will talk to a few blokes to figure out what the problem is and why the record is so horrendous, because it is horrendous.\u201d England triumphed 21-16 on their last visit to Cardiff under Stuart Lancaster but their 30-3 hammering in 2013 was the fourth defeat they had suffered across the Severn Bridge since 2005. Previous regimes have arranged for Welsh hymns to blast from speakers beside the training pitch in the build-up and Jones is joking about inviting Sir Tom Jones into camp \u2013 \u201cPossibly, yeah \u2026 I used to like him when I was young\u201d \u2013 to put his players in the mood. Wales\u2019s 33-7 success over Italy in Rome has also raised the stakes, with the hosts\u2019 hoping England will agree to the Principality Stadium roof being closed. As things stand, Jones is not overly bothered. \u201cI don\u2019t care. They can have fireworks going off, it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s the same for both teams,\u201d he said. \u201cThe louder and more rowdy, the better it is. Those are the games you want to win. Are they closing [the roof]? We\u2019ll toss a coin and see what happens.\u201d \u201cYou have to be able to cope with it. What happens in a World Cup final if you don\u2019t like the atmosphere? That is what Test rugby is about and that is the fun part of it. We have to find a way to overcome that. But it is not going to be overcome by repeating history. We will work out what has been done in the past and make sure we don\u2019t do it. I have a solution for it but I am not prepared to share it with you.\u201d Jones\u2019s own last visit to Cardiff with Australia in 2005 ended in defeat \u2013 \u201cIt hasn\u2019t got good memories for me so we\u2019d better win there\u201d \u2013 and he is hoping for firmer officiating at the scrum than in the France game. \u201cEvery time there was a scrum, there was a debate. It was like Parliament and watching Theresa May go against the other bloke,\u201d he said. England, meanwhile, have confirmed George Kruis is to undergo a knee operation on Tuesday and will be out until at least late April. But Mako Vunipola is still hoping to be fit for the latter half of the side\u2019s Six Nations campaign."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
