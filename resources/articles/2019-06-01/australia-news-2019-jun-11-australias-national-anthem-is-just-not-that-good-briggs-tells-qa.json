Appearing on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program on Monday, Briggs was asked about his video for The Weekly in which he said the anthem \u201csucks\u201d, and sought to explain what it \u201csounds like when blackfellas listen to it\u201d. The video sparked a critical front-page news story in the West Australian. On Monday night Briggs dismissed the backlash, saying he tried to push himself out of his comfort zone because \u201cchange doesn\u2019t come from being comfortable\u201d. \u201cI always get the kickback,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of, that\u2019s just showbiz, baby.\u201d The Victorian musician said he wanted to provide a \u201cscoreboard\u201d to Australia that showed the disadvantages faced by First Nations people. The video was prompted by the news a group of Indigenous rugby league players would not sing the anthem at last week\u2019s State of Origin match. The rapper \u2013 whose best-known songs includes January 26, which advocates changing the date of Australia Day \u2013 told the Q&amp;A audience most young Australians were taught to sing the anthem at school and didn\u2019t \u201cask questions \u2026 because everyone else is [singing it]\u201d. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think a lot of people are that attached to the actual anthem. It\u2019s only 35 years old. I don\u2019t think anyone is really that attached to it because the song\u2019s just not that good,\u201d he said to applause. In a special episode to mark Sydney\u2019s Vivid festival, he was joined on the panel by the actor and writer Faustina Agolley, the billionaire founder of Atlassian Mike Cannon-Brookes, the CSIRO chief executive, Larry Marshall, and the cyberpsychologist Jocelyn Brewer. Cannon-Brookes said he had changed his mind about the anthem after watching Briggs\u2019s video. \u201cHe\u2019s totally right,\u201d he said. \u201cThis made a lot of sense. It changed the way I thought about the anthem. It is what great art should do, it made you think about it and it changed my opinion. Can we change everybody in the country? I think we\u2019ve got a chance.\u201d Briggs has not stood for the anthem since he was 13 or 14 years old. \u201cIt\u2019s about acknowledgment for Indigenous people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd our place in Australia as the first people of Australia, being here for 60,000-plus years.\u201d Asked which lyrics he did not agree with, he singled out \u201cthe idea that Australia is young and free \u2026 when Indigenous people are some of the most incarcerated people on the face of the earth\u201d. Critics say the use of the word \u201cyoung\u201d disregards the fact that Indigenous Australians are one of the oldest cultures in the world. The anthem also includes the line \u201cwealth for toil\u201d, which riled Briggs because \u201conly one in 10 Indigenous Australians are financially secure\u201d. Advance Australia Fair was written in 1878 by \u200ePeter Dodds McCormick but was not adopted as the national anthem until 1984, replacing God Save the Queen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
