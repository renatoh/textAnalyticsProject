Cambridgeshire constabulary is sending out detailed questionnaires to journalists, asking them if they would be willing to hand over any information that could prove useful without the need for a court order. The memo goes on to state that the police will resort to using court orders if necessary. The police are also trying to ascertain whether newspapers have signed up any friends or relatives involved in the case for future stories. The questionnaire from Detective Superintendent Chris Stevenson asks the following questions. \u00b7 \"What material, videos or otherwise do you possess which relates in any way to the investigation into the disappearance of Holly Wells and Jessica Champman?\" \u00b7 \"Has the material been retained?\" \u00b7 \"If yes, where?\" \u00b7 \"Would you be prepared to disclose this material to the police without a court order (you should be aware that court orders will be sought to access all material which is felt to be of relevance to the investigation).\" \u00b7 \"Are you aware of any other information that might be of assistance to the investigation?\" \u00b7 \"Please provide details of where any court order should be delivered.\" \u00b7 \"Have any contractual arrangements been made between your company and any other third party with regard to this matter?\" \u00b7 \"Could you please reply asap?\" A spokeswoman for the police said today: \"We can confirm that questionnaires have been sent to journalists who have been identified as reporting on the Soham case as it is considered they may be witnesses and may hold relevant evidence.\" Before Mr Huntley was arrested and charged with the murders, he came into close contact with journalists covering the police investigation. The London Evening Standard's Harriet Arkell, for example, wrote last month about how she had knocked on Mr Huntley's door and asked to use his video player when she was in a hurry to watch a tape of a police appeal. Television reporters also interviewed him about the girls' disappearance. Last month the Cambridgeshire police asked broadcast organisations to hand over any footage that could provide evidence in the case. Sky, ITN and the BBC all complied with the request and the BBC went one step further by producing material that had not been transmitted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
