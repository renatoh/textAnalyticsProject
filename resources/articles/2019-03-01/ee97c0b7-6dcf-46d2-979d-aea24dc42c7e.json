In a tweet posted on Saturday morning, Sky New Zealand, an independently-owned broadcaster, said it had decided to remove the Australian 24-hour news channel from its platform because it was airing distressing footage from the shooter\u2019s Facebook live stream. But Sky NZ subsequently deleted the tweet, and on Sunday the Sky Australia chief executive, Paul Whittaker, said the decision had been taken jointly by the two stations \u201cto ensure any live coverage or commentary taking place in Australia, outside of the NZ jurisdiction, does not impact the unfolding events in NZ\u201d. Sky NZ initially declined to confirm why the feed had been changed. But on Wednesday evening, in response to repeated requests from Guardian Australia, it said in a statement the decision was taken \u201cin consultation\u201d with Sky News Australia, and the feed had subsequently been restored. \u201cThe decision to replace the channel on Sky NZ was done in consultation with Sky News Australia on Friday night to ensure any live coverage or commentary taking place in Australia, outside of the NZ jurisdiction, did not compromise the NZ investigations and legal process,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe amended our public statements on Saturday when we realised our comments were being interpreted as SKY [NZ] having acted unilaterally, and we clarified that the reason for the removal was to not compromise police investigations and the legal process in NZ. \u201cWe have been working closely with Sky News Australia to address these matters, and we were pleased to be in a position to put the channel back up today.\u201d The statement did not explain why the initial tweet was posted on Saturday, if the two broadcasters had agreed to replace the channel on Friday. Despite a plea from New Zealand police, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Australian pay-TV channel was among the broadcasters that chose to screen Go Pro footage shot by the man who slaughtered 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch on Friday. \u201cPolice are aware there is extremely distressing footage relating to the incident in Christchurch circulating online,\u201d the police said in a statement. \u201cWe would strongly urge that the link not be shared. We are working to have any footage removed.\u201d Brenton Tarrant was alleged to have filmed a 17-minute Facebook video which included his drive to the mosque, his arsenal of weapons and graphic scenes of his murderous rampage. Media organisations that have used the film stopped the video as he entered the mosque. Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have removed the footage but new copies are constantly being uploaded. Sky News Australia broadcast the footage repeatedly in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, sparking anger on social media.It was also shown via Sky News Australia on screens in Qantas airways lounges at airports. Qantas has been approached for comment. A spokeswoman for Sky New Zealand told Guardian Australia on Saturday the channel had been removed because it did not want the footage aired. \u201cWe stand in support of our fellow New Zealanders and do not wish to show the distressing footage that has been shared at this time. We will resume service when available,\u201d a social media spokeswoman said on Twitter. \u201cAll other news channels are still available. BBC World and CNN are available on SKY GO.\u201d Sky New Zealand attempted to calm anger over Sky\u2019s repeated use of the footage by assuring the public it was a separate company owned by New Zealanders and was not affiliated with News Corp. Sky News Australia said later on Saturday it \u201cprovides a live feed into New Zealand on the SKY television platform\u201d. \u201cAs the live rolling events of the Christchurch shooting unfolded, an editorial decision was made by Sky News Australia to offer sports programming to SKY NZ in place of Sky News Australia\u2019s live feed to ensure any footage or reporting did not compromise the ongoing investigations taking place in New Zealand. \u201cSky News Australia acted responsibly and prudently in replacing the service as soon as it was able to early yesterday evening after consulting with SKY NZ management.\u201d On Friday a Sky News Australia spokesman had said: \u201cSky News in line with other broadcasters ran heavily edited footage that did not show the shootings or the victims.\u201d Another Australian channel, Network 10, defended its decision to embed parts of the video on its 10 Daily platform as part of its news coverage on Friday. \u201cWe are appalled and deeply saddened by the tragic events in Christchurch today,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cLike other media outlets, 10 Daily showed footage of the gunman walking towards the door of the mosque. We warned about the nature of the vision in the accompanying story. We did not show any vision from inside the mosque.\u201d The public broadcaster ABC did not use the audio or the footage from the Go Pro camera but did show images on air and online. The edited video was heavily promoted on all News Corp websites, with warnings about distressing content. This story was amended on 21 March 2019 to take account of Sky NZ\u2019s latest statement on the reason for replacing Sky News Australia. \u2022 Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day.
