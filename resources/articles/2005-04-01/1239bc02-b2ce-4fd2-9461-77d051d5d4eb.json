Lord Saville, who chaired the Bloody Sunday inquiry, has criticised the Inquiries Act 2005, which allows ministers to issue notices stopping certain evidence from being given in public and restricting publication in the public interest. The act replaces the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 which gives chairmen a free hand. Lord Saville has told Baroness Ashton, minister in the department of constitutional affairs, in a letter: \"This provision makes a very serious inroad into the independence of any inquiry; and is likely to damage or destroy public confidence in the inquiry and its findings, especially in any case where the conduct of the authorities may be in question. \"As a judge, I must tell you that I would not be prepared to be appointed as a member of an inquiry that was subject to a provision of this kind.\" The Canadian judge Peter Cory was appointed by the British and Irish governments to investigate allegations of collusion in Mr Finucane's murder. He concluded in 2003 that there was \"strong evidence that collusive acts were committed\" by the army, the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the security service, and that a public inquiry was needed. A British government official told the UN Commission for Human Rights in Geneva last week that a public inquiry would be held into Mr Finucane's murder, but that most witnesses would give evidence in private. However, Judge Cory told the US Congressional hearings into human rights in Northern Ireland last month, before the act became law: \"It seems to me that the proposed new act would make a meaningful inquiry impossible. The minister, the actions of whose ministry was to be reviewed by the public inquiry, would have the authority to thwart the efforts of the inquiry at every step. \"It really creates an intolerable Alice in Wonderland situation. There have been references in the press to an international judicial membership in the inquiry. \"If the new act were to be come law, I would advise all Canadian judges to decline an appointment in light of the impossible situation they would be facing. In fact, I cannot contemplate any self-respecting Canadian judge accepting an appointment to an inquiry constituted under the new proposed act,\" he said. In her letter, Mrs Finucane cites the views of Lord Saville and Judge Cory and asks the judges: \"In view of these considerations I write to request that, if approached to serve on an Inquiries Act Inquiry into my husband's murder, you, like Lord Saville and Judge Cory, refuse to accept such an appointment.\" Lorna Davidson, of British Irish Rights Watch, said: \"The minister can prevent particular witnesses' evidence from being given in public and any evidence could be expunged from the final report. \"The fear is that any witnesses who might say anything remotely damaging or controversial might be heard in private, so we'd never get to know what they actually said.\" A spokesman for the Northern Ireland Office said: \"The government is clear that the Inquiries Act provides the best way for a Finucane inquiry to proceed efficiently and effectively in a way which takes into account both the wider public interest and the public interest in national security. \"Absolutely nothing will be withheld from the person chairing the inquiry or the inquiry team.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
