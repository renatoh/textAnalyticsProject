Dense breast tissue has been seen as an indicator of high risk for the cancer, but a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine on Monday found that only half the women found to have dense breasts were in need of supplemental screening like ultrasound or MRI. Researchers examined data from 365,426 women, ages 40-74, and found about 45% of them to have dense breast tissue, which can make detecting cancer via mammogram difficult. All together the women had more than 831,450 mammograms from 2002 to 2011. Dr Karla Kerlikowske, a University of California San Francisco professor of epidemiology and biostatistics, is the lead author on the study. She hoped it would narrow physicians\u2019 ability to predict how many patients are at high risk for breast cancer, leading to fewer needless surgeries. \u201cAbout 45% of women have dense breasts; that\u2019s a large number of women. But the sensitivity of mammograms is such that we\u2019re not missing 45% of cancers. So can we narrow it down to women who are at higher risk of cancer, and especially women at higher risk of advanced cancer?\u201d Kerlikowske told NPR. \u201cThen if we did supplemental imaging of women in that group it might help them.\u201d Women with dense breast tissue are advised to have more than the recommended annual mammogram, and in at least 21 states doctors are required to recommend the additional screening to women with dense breasts. These notifications have at times caused stress and confusion for the thousands of women who are found to have dense breast tissue. By developing more specific indicators for determining who is high-risk, it is possible that this anxiety could be lessened. Dense breast tissue can make it more difficult to detect cancer and has been linked to an increased risk of cancer. But the study finds that breast density alone is not a strong enough indicator to predict risk. The study instead used multi-variable models to determine which women would develop cancer. Researchers considered other risk factors such as their five-year breast cancer risk, age, family history, breast tissue density and other information contained in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium calculator for breast cancer risk. This summer Kerlikowske hopes to publish results on whether supplemental ultrasound and MRI screening does improve the chances of detecting cancer. \u201cWe have data on both of them, and we\u2019re in the process of analyzing them,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
