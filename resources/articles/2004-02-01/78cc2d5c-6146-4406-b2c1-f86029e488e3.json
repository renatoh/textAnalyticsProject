Last week Labour's governing body gave the RMT until Saturday lunchtime to break off its links with the SSP, whose candidates challenge the party's own in Scotland, or be disaffiliated. Five RMT branches in Scotland - including Glasgow and Edinburgh - have affiliated to the SSP following a decision by the union's conference last year to allow them to back organisations that support its objectives. The RMT is recalling that conference in Glasgow tomorrow to decide whether to back down or stick with its decision whatever the consequences to its historic relationship with Labour. It emerged today that a branch of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) in Scotland, representing 4,500 postal workers is prepared to affiliate to the SSP in a show of solidarity with the RMT. Derek Durkin, secretary of the CWU branch, which covers Edinburgh, said: \"We are not going to sit back and see fellow trade unions attacked by Labour. \"If Labour expels the RMT we will take immediate steps to affiliate to the Scottish Socialist party as a sign of solidarity.\" Mr Durkin claimed there was a growing mood of anger among trade unionists in Scotland over Labour's dispute with the RMT. Several branches of the Fire Brigades Union have also tabled motions for its annual conference in May calling for disaffiliation from Labour, in a further sign of tension between unions and the party. The RMT is considering taking legal action against Labour, and said it has not been told which of the party's rules it has broken. Rail unions have some of the strongest links with Labour, after playing a huge part in launching the party at the turn of the last century."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
