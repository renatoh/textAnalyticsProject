I\u2019ll leave you with our match report from Anfield. Thanks for your company - bye. Here\u2019s Jordan Henderson \u201cI thought the performance overall was very good, but we\u2019re disappointed with the goals we conceded. You need to be fully focussed at all times, we\u2019ve seen that over the years. We created so many chances to score. We\u2019ve got to take it on the chin.\u201d Here\u2019s Kieran Trippier \u201cWe needed to stay strong defensively, keep our shape, and try to frustrate them as much as we could. We kept on going and we got the win. Liverpool are very strong at home \u2013 we knew that \u2013 but we knew we\u2019d get our chances if we broke the first press. It was about being clinical in that moment, and we sure were tonight. \u201cNever give up. The way we play is the way we train \u2013 the manager is the same in training as he is on the touchline. It\u2019s a joy to work with him and to learn off him. I\u2019m delighted to be here.\u201d \u201cYou have to give Atl\u00e9tico some credit,\u201d says Juan Antonio Escudero. \u201cTough side. And no shenanigans.\u201d Yeah, they were pretty well behaved. They did so well to stay in the tie when they were being battered. \u201cYour comments today,\u201d says K A Tsokos. \u201cPlease look up the meaning of the word \u2018hybris\u2019.\u201d I would do but I threw my dictionary out of the window in a huff when Morata scored. Football, effing hell. Liverpool slaughtered Atletico Madrid for 95 minutes, playing with awesome relentlessness, and finally went ahead in the tie through Roberto Firmino\u2019s goal at the start of extra time. But a desperate mistake from Adrian led to Marcos Llorente\u2019s first goal, which put Atletico ahead on away goals, and they grabbed two more in a surreal end to the tie. They barely had an attack in normal time. But their defensive resilience was extraordinary, because that Liverpool performance would have beaten many teams by five or six. If ever there was a team in the image of their manager... That\u2019s it! Liverpool are out of the Champions League after an extraordinary period of extra-time at Anfield. Diego Simeone is off down the touchline, spreading his arms wide to the adoring Atletico fans. This is one of the greatest nights in their history. Morata ran onto a return pass from Llorente, surged into the area and curled a low shot past Adrian at the near post. That\u2019s it! 120 min Two minutes. 119 min Alexander-Arnold brattishly shoves over Morata, who gets up and goes head to head with Alexander-Arnold. Both are booked. It\u2019s a slightly undignified end to Liverpool\u2019s reign as European champions, though you can understand why their collective noggin has gone. 118 min \u201cHardly matters does it?\u201d says Des Platt. \u201cCompetition is going nowhere except possibly behind closed doors which is meaningless.\u201d With that kind of positive spin, you should be in politics. 117 min Minamino\u2019s cross is headed up in the air by van Dijk and palmed away by Oblak, who is fouled needlessly by Milner in the process. Liverpool\u2019s heads have gone. 116 min Van Dijk is playing centre forward now. Origi wins a corner and takes it short to Milner, whose cross is nutted away by Saul. 115 min Mane curls well wide from 25 yards. Liverpool have been too impatient since Atletico\u2019s first goal. For the 97 minutes before that, they were astonishingly good. 115 min Liverpool can\u2019t get any momentum. The subdued atmosphere can\u2019t help, but it\u2019s understandable in the circumstances. 113 min Liverpool\u2019s last change: Minamino for Firmino. 113 min \u201cIt\u2019s Wednesday, Rob,\u201d says Niall Fogarty. \u201cIt\u2019s Wednesday.\u201d It\u2019ll be Thursday by the time this goes to penalties! 112 min An ill-conceived shot from Origi, on the left of the area, goes well wide of the near post. 111 min The Anfield atmosphere is as dreadful as it was brilliant earlier in the game, though that will change if they get one. I think everyone, including the Liverpool players, is slightly in shock. 110 min Another corner to Liverpool. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s booming curler goes out of play and then swerves back onto the field. 109 min \u201cA couple more goals,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves, \u201cand this most definitely won\u2019t go to penalties.\u201d 109 min Mane goes down in the area, but the referee isn\u2019t interested. He\u2019s wagged his finger a lot tonight. 108 min Liverpool must be winning about 17-0 on Expected Goals. 107 min Mane\u2019s dangerous low cross is pushed away by Oblak. Atletico have now parked a fleet of buses in their own area. 106 min Liverpool kick off the second half of extra time. I can\u2019t quite believe this is happening. Atletico make a change as well: Gimenez for Correa. A double change for Liverpool: Origi and Fabinho replace Wijnaldum and Henderson. Liverpool could still do this. Two goals in 15 minutes is not beyond them. This is staggering. Liverpool absolutely battered Atletico for 97 minutes. And then Alexander-Arnold passed the ball back to Adrian. 105+2 min That second Llorente goal means the tie can no longer go to penalties. Now Liverpool need two goals or they are out. Atletico broke down the right through Morata, who clipped the ball infield to find Llorente 25 yards from goal. He ran at the backpedalling Gomez, moved the ball away from Henderson on the edge of the D and curled another precise right-footed shot that dipped under the dive of Adrian. He might have done better with that as well, though I\u2019d like to see it again. What on earth is happening? 103 min Alvaro Morata replaces Joao Felix for Atletico. 102 min \u201cNo Rob it wasn\u2019t going to pens after Liverpool scored their 2nd on the night,\u201d says Niall Fogarty. Fair point. It was all so frantic, from one goal to the next, that I forgot what day it was. 101 min Some news from Italy. This match might be the last football we see for a while. 100 min Liverpool dust themselves off and go again. Henderson\u2019s chipped cross is headed to the edge of the area, where Salah volleys over. 98 min That Llorente goal means the tie can\u2019t go to penalties. As things stand, Atletico are going through on the away goals rule. Alexander-Arnold played the ball back to Adrian, who kicked it straight to Joao Felix 40 yards form goal. He played a simple reverse pass to Llorente on the edge of the area, and he curled a precise low shot into the far corner. Oh my. Adrian might have saved the shot had he not slipped as he tried to move across his line. But the real howler was the clearance to Joao Felix. Atletico have scored after a howler from Adrian! They\u2019re ahead on away goals. This team are just awesome, utterly relentless. Wijnaldum charged down the right and hammered a cross towards Firmno 10 yards from goal. His superb downward header beat the diving Oblak and hit the inside of the far post, but the ball rebounded perfectly for Firmino to cushion a volley into the open net. It\u2019s his first goal at Anfield all season. Roberto Firmino scores at Anfield! 92 min: More chances for Liverpool! Wijnaldum\u2019s drive is pushed away by the plunging Oblak, a fine save down to his right. The ball comes back to Wijnaldum, who stands up a cross towards Firmino on the six-yard line, but he can\u2019t quite get over the ball and it skims off his head and away from goal. 91 min Peep peep! Atletico begin extra time, having made another change: Vrsaljko on for Trippier, who is presumably knackered, at right back. Despite some ferocious attacking from Liverpool, the tie is going to extra time. See you soon. SAUL NIGUEZ HAS A GOAL DISALLOWED! It will be checked. He was a million miles offside, in fact, before he headed it superbly into the top corner. Simeone and half the Atletico bench were on the pitch. 90+2 min Alexander-Arnold concedes a silly free-kick, 30 yards from goal on the left. This will be the last attack of normal time. 90+1 min Oblak makes a comfortable save from Salah\u2019s snap volley. 90 min We\u2019re a couple of minutes away from extra time. 88 min Alexander-Arnold\u2019s shot is desperately blocked by Saul Niguez. This is an unreal onslaught from Liverpool, and moments later Mane puts another overhead kick over the bar. That was a tougher chance than the first. 87 min Salah comes this close to putting Liverpool through. He beat three players as he zipped infield from the right and then smashed a rising drive that beat Oblak but just cleared the crossbar. 86 min Whatever happens, Liverpool have been immense tonight. 85 min Yet another chance for Liverpool. Milner stands up a cross from the left to Wijnaldum at the far post. He heads it back across the area to Mane, whose spectacular overhead kick flashes over the bar. 84 min Liverpool are just relentless. It\u2019s quite something to watch. Wijnaldum\u2019s vicious shot, from a ridiculous angle, is slapped away by a startled Oblak. 82 min James Milner replaces Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who has been terrific. 81 min A brilliant corner from Liverpool. Alexander-Arnold takes it short, gets it back and then hammers a sharp pass towards the unmarked Robertson in the D. He charges onto the ball - but then slashes it over the bar. That was a decent chance. 79 min Saul Niguez\u2019s snap volley from 30 yards goes approximately 30 yards wide. 78 min More superb play from Partey, who beats two players near the halfway line and draws a foul from Firmino. He\u2019s majestic. 77 min A little bit of possession for Atletico, who were in urgent need of a beeather. An away goal now would be devastating, although they still don\u2019t really look like scoring. 75 min Thomas Partey has had a brilliant game for Atletico. He\u2019s been their most composed player in possession by a distance, and he\u2019s probably been their best ballwinner as well. 74 min The diminutive Correa tries to pick a fight with van Dijk, who looks him down and further down with contempt. 73 min \u201cTo those pondering where they might have seen Diego Simeone\u2019s hairdo before,\u201d begins Christian Svanes Kolding, \u201cmight I beseech them to examine photos of Tom Waits early in his career?\u201d 72 min The corner is headed away at the near post. 71 min Oxlade-Chamberlain surges down the right to win a corner. Liverpool are having one of their irresistible spells. 70 min Oblak has made a lot of saves in this match, at least six or seven, although they have all been good rather than great. 69 min Talking of which: Alexander-Arnold swishes a cracking shot from 30 yards that is palmed away by Oblak, diving to his right. The ball rebounds to the other full-back, Robertson, whose shot is vitally blocked by Trippier. 68 min A wicked inswinging corner from Alexander-Arnold is dropped behind him by Oblak, who is glad to see Lodi lump the ball clear. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s ball-striking is just incredible. 66 min: Robertson hits the bar! I thought that was in. Salah twisted outside Lodi out on the right side of the area and hit a deflected cross-shot into the middle. Robertson got in front of Tripper on the six-yard line, but his header smacked off the crossbar. Having got to the ball, he probably should have scored. 64 min Atletico have been a bit better since the substitution. They\u2019ve had shots on goal and everything. 63 min Saul Niguez tries to score from 60 yards. He spotted Adrian on the edge of the penalty area and had a pop with his left foot. It drifted a few yards wide; I suspect Adrian would have got back in time anyway. 61 min: Adrian makes a double save! Joao Felix\u2019s low, long-range shot was fumbled dismally by Adrian, but he made up for his mistake by charging across the area to sprawl at the feet of Correa. The second save was excellent. 60 min: Firmino misses a great chance! Alexander-Arnold\u2019s curling free-kick from the right beat Oblak and reached Firmino beyond the far post. He mistimed a half-volley at goal, however, and Oblak was able to palm the ball away. Firmino shouldn\u2019t have given him a chance. 59 min A relatively quiet few minutes. It does feel like a second Liverpool goal is coming, though. 56 min Correa has moved up front for Atletico, so they are still playing 4-4-2. Joao Felix hits a tame shot straight at Adrian from 25 yards. 55 min Atletico make their first change: the midfielder Marcos Llorente replaces Diego Costa, who shakes his head in disgust and then hoofs something as he leaves the field. He\u2019s fuming. He\u2019s also done bugger all. 54 min Atletico look like they\u2019re playing for penalties, already. Oxlade-Chamberlain hits a crisp low drive from 30 yards that is palmed behind at full stretch by Oblak. The conditions certainly favour long-range shooting. 53 min Liverpool\u2019s relentlessness is starting to wear Atletico down. Salah fizzes a great pass infield to Oxlade-Chamberlain, who lifts a hopeful shot over the bar from the right side of the box. He should have crossed it. 52 min Atletico can\u2019t keep the ball for more than a few seconds. Diego Costa, bless him, has been useless. 51 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Scott Oliver. \u201cThe hipsters and Hispanists will be aware that Atl\u00e9tico are known as los colchoneros, \u2018the mattress makers\u2019. They perhaps don\u2019t realise this is because the city\u2019s production of mattresses has increased by 843% since Simeone became El Gaffer\u00edsimo, on account of him scattering them around the training ground for the three-times-a-week simulation sessions.\u201d I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve been too bad tonight, yet. 50 min Oblak makes a good save from Mane, although the flag had gone up. 48 min Wijnaldum sprays an outstanding long pass to Salah, who has too much pace for Lodi and charges into the area on the right. He tries to curl the ball into the far corner but his shot is too close to Oblak, who saves comfortably. 47 min \u201cIt\u2019s bothered me since the first leg whose hair do Simone\u2019s reminds me of,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cHe seems to have lopped two inches off the top, but still I think it\u2019s Eraserhead from the eponymous David Lynch film. Dark, brooding, utterly bleak, with a hint of malevolent comedy. The film\u2019s not bad either.\u201d 46 min Peep peep! Liverpool begin the second half. It\u2019s still pouring down at Anfield. \u201cWell,\u201d says Matt Dony, \u201cthe first half was Quite Annoying.\u201d \u201cWijnaldum and the Spanish,\u201d says Robin Michael Thompson. \u201cI don\u2019t think Wijnaldum has ever forgiven the foul on Salah in the 1919 final.\u201d He\u2019s got a long memory. Atletico almost made it to half-time with their unique combination of heroic defending and brazen snidery. But Gini Wijnaldum\u2019s excellent header has brought Liverpool level in the tie, and they\u2019ll be attacking the Kop in the second half. Atletico need a goal. If they get one, they might sneak through. If not, no chance. Peep peep! The corner was overhit by Alexander-Arnold. 45+1 min One minute of added time. Liverpool have a corner... 44 min Just in case you\u2019d forgotten, Wijnaldum scored twice against Barcelona in the semi-final last year. That is a terrific header. The move started when Salah played a simple ball to the underlapping Oxlade-Chamberlain on the right. He curled an excellent cross on the turn towards the penalty spot, where Wijnaldum was waiting. He slammed a header into the ground that zipped off the wet turf and into the far corner, past the diving Oblak. The power and especially the placement were perfect. Gini Wijnaldum does it again! 42 min Oxlade-Chamberlain curls well wide from long range. It was the wrong option, poorly executed. But apart from that... 41 min Robertson and especially Alexander-Arnold have been a constant threat, arguably Liverpool\u2019s best attackers. Alexander-Arnold hits Felix with a fair, man-and-ball tackle and then shouts in his face. This match is one false move away from a brawl. 40 min Felipe and Savic make two brilliant defensive headers in the space of 30 seconds. Atletico could really use the half-time whistle. 39 min \u201cCan we gush about Thomas in that Atleti midfield?\u201d says Ruth Purdue. \u201cWhat a superb box to box midfielder he is!\u201d I think he\u2019s brilliant. He\u2019s been doing gruntwork tonight but there\u2019s so much more to his game. I read somewhere that his release clause is really low, something like 50m euros. I would love him at United. 38 min Atletico appeal unsuccessfully for a yellow card when Henderson fouls Correa. It\u2019s getting very niggly. Just before that, there was a slight shoving match on the line before a Liverpool corner was taken. 36 min: Good save from Oblak! Liverpool are starting to put Atletico under pressure. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s wicked, bouncing cross from the right is missed by the stretching Firmino at the near post and palmed away by Oblak. He did really well because he had to change direction when Firmino didn\u2019t get the expected touch. 34 min Salah shoves Lodi off the ball on the right, scurries infield and flicks a pass with the outside of the foot to the unmarked Mane in the D. His low first-time shot is straight at Oblak, who spills it but is able to grab it at the second attempt. Mane\u2019s shot lacked power and accuracy; he probably had time for an extra touch. 33 min \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Matt Turland. \u201cIs there a team more love/hate than Atletico under Simeone? And by that, I mean, I love watching them for the wonderful way they defend as one, as a single entity. And yet, at the same time, I hate them for all their sh*thousing and all that jazz. Love. Hate.\u201d 32 min A cross from the left is headed behind by van Dijk. This has been a crap game, in terms of conventional entertainment, but it\u2019s thoroughly compelling. 30 min Liverpool are starting to get a bit frustrated with Atletico\u2019s experience. Henderson goes through the back of Felix, a silly tackle that allows Atletico to waste another 20 or 30 seconds. There\u2019s been a goal in Paris... 28 min A few of you have asked about the handball appeal in the 20th minute. The updated law says that extra leeway will be given to defenders when the ball ricochets onto the hand, which is exactly what happened. It\u2019s different if you\u2019re the attacking team. Had an identical incident led to a goal, it would have been disallowed. 26 min A corner is headed away to Oxlade-Chamberlain on the right. His very deep cross is nodded back across goal by van Dijk, and Costa does well to smuggle the ball behind for another corner. 25 min Liverpool have so far been unable to put Atletico under sustained pressure - partly because of the excellence of the defending, partly because of the stop-start nature of the game. I still think Liverpool will be too good, but it could be a long night. 24 min \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Matt Emerson. \u201cI know you say the Diego Costa looks old, but I suspect he\u2019s always been like that. There\u2019s probably photos of him as a particularly grizzled baby looking like Clyde out of the Anthill Mob (one for the teenagers, that).\u201d 22 min There\u2019s a bit of needle when Alexander-Arnold is penalised for a high challenge. Then Diego Costa throws the ball away and escapes a booking. The snideometer has been switched on in the last few minutes. 20 min A couple of corners in quick succession for Liverpool. The second is headed towards goal by Mane and hits an Atletico player, prompting an unsuccessful appeal for handball. It did hit the hand but only after a deflection off Lodi\u2019s head. 19 min Atletico will be pretty happy so far. Although Liverpool have dominated, Oblak has only had one vaguely difficult save to make. 18 min Atletico win a corner on the left. Koke wanders over at his leisure to take it. Eventually he curls it flat and hard towards the near post, where Felipe flashes a header just wide. That could easily have gone past Adrian and into the net. 17 min Atletico are defending so deep, with the front two of Joao Felix and Diego Costa often only 30 yards from their own goal. 15 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201cRe: 10 min. I\u2019m somewhat disappointed that Diego Costa hasn\u2019t been sent off yet but I do feel some empathy for his...oldness. Ok, I\u2019m done with empathy now. Attack!!!\u201d 14 min Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s fierce low drive, through a crowded area, is palmed away by the diving Oblak. He got a bit lucky, Oblak, as he could easily have pushed it straight to a Liverpool player. 11 min A cross is headed out to Henderson, whose mishit shot from 25 yards goes well wide. It hasn\u2019t quite been the ferocious start I expected from Liverpool, although they only need one goal to level the tie. 10 min Salah curls over the bar from the edge of the area. It was a typical effort: he received the ball from Mane, cut inside Saul Niguez and tried to curl it into the far top corner. 10 min Joao Felix looks really bright whenever Atletico do have the ball. Diego Costa looks ... old. 9 min After a short free-kick, Partey drives a long, angled pass over the Liverpool defence. Trippier gets round the back but has to stretch to reach the ball and his attempted volley across goal goes into the side netting. Adrian had it covered. 6 min Atletico are taking plenty of time over any throw-ins, a tactic that is booed every time by the Liverpool fans. The atmosphere is marvellously hostile. 5 min The first half-chance for Liverpool. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s cross, from a narrow position on the right, is flicked towards goal by the head of Wijnaldum. Oblak moves smartly across his line to make a comfortable save. 4 min Lots of early posssession for Liverpool, the first 13 seconds aside. Atletico always knew it was going to be like this. 2 min \u201c\u2018Quite annoying\u2019,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cYes, J\u00fcrgen. If there\u2019s one phrase that sums up playing a Diego Simeone team, especially one with a lead to defend, it\u2019s \u2018quite annoying\u2019. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love Simeone, but I\u2019m not expecting this match to be anything other than quite annoying. And, obviously, by \u2018quite annoying\u2019, we all mean \u2018absolutely flipping infuriating, frustrating and maddening\u2019!\u201d 13 seconds: Costa hits the side netting! That was half a chance. He ran onto a nice through pass from Joao Felix, rumbled to the edge of the area and hit a low shot that Adrian ushered into the side netting. He was under pressure from Gomez (I think); otherwise it would have been a clear chance. 1 min Atletico, in black, are booed as they kick off from left to right. Liverpool are in red. The players emerge from the tunnel on a wild night at Anfield. It\u2019s wet, windy and bloody loud. Adrian looks a little pensive; this is a huge night for him. If you loved Italia 90, you\u2019ll really love this Jurgen Klopp speaks \u201cIt\u2019s a complex thing tonight. We need a complete performance. We know Atletico can be quite annoying, we can be annoying as well in a different way, so it\u2019s a good fit for Diego Costa. We have to keep calm and play our football.\u201d Pre-match entertainment \u201cFabinho had looked a little off his feed and strangely tentative on it following his return from injury,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cChambo definitely deserves his start after his last game. He\u2019s also the only one who can score from outside a box otherwise brimful with Madridistas.\u201d The tempo in the first 20 minutes is going to be quite something. Liverpool are aiming to win the European Cup for the seventh time, and to retain it for the first time since 1978. I\u2019m not sure that will be possible, mind you: it looks increasingly likely that the coronavirus will stop the 2019-20 season from being completed. Pre-match reading Tonight\u2019s other Champions League match is a cracker, and Paul Doyle is all over it. There\u2019s one slight surprise in the Liverpool team, with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain preferred to Fabinho. Atletico\u2019s starting XI includes Kieran Trippier and the popular, equable Diego Costa. Popcorn, please! Liverpool (4-3-3) Adrian; Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, van Dijk, Robertson; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Henderson, Wijnaldum; Salah, Firmino, Mane. Substitutes: Lonergan, Fabinho, Milner, Minamino, Lallana, Origi, Matip. Atletico Madrid (4-4-2) Oblak; Trippier, Savic, Felipe, Renan Lodi; Koke, Saul Niguez, Thomas, Correa; Diego Costa, Joao Felix. Substitutes: Adan, Gimenez, Morata, Lemar, Llorente, Carrasco, Vrsaljko. Referee Danny Makkelie (Netherlands). The pyrotechnics have begun in the streets around Anfield \u2026 But Simeone is in the building \u2026 Hello and welcome to live coverage of Liverpool\u2019s attack versus Atletico Madrid\u2019s defence. That, all things being equal, is how tonight\u2019s match will pan out. Atletico won the first leg 1-0, the ideal score to set up a night of tension, drama and one-way traffic at Anfield. Liverpool are the best team in Europe but Atletico are probably the best party-poopers in Europe. They will have not a solitary qualm about defending deep, wasting time, playing on the break and bantering Liverpool off for 90 minutes with you-know-what. If Atletico score one goal, Liverpool will need to get three against an accomplished and extremely experienced (sic) defence. Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side have had a recent blip \u2013 some people even used the word \u2018crisis\u2019, apparently with a straight face \u2013 but they have Jordan Henderson back to raise the intensity. They have never lost a two-legged European tie under Jurgen Klopp, and whatever happens they won\u2019t go quietly. Nor will Atletico. They live for chances like this, to stick one up the elite in a Champions League knockout tie. They did it to Barcelona and Chelsea in 2013-14, and to Barcelona and Bayern Munich two years later. That last victory, over Pep Guardiola\u2019s Bayern, is their template for tonight. Liverpool have plenty of templates to consult. From Juventus in 1965-66 to Barcelona in 2018-19, via Saint-Etienne, Auxerre and Borussia Dortmund, this club loves a second-leg Anfield comeback. Kick off is at 8pm GMT."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
