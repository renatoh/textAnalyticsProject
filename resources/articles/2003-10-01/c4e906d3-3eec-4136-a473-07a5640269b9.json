The US, through its secretary of state, Colin Powell, has appealed to international aid agencies to stay in the country, despite the recent carnage. That carnage has included the deliberate targeting of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and the earlier bombing of Baghdad's UN headquarters. The US appeal is a devastating admission of failure. It is a failure not only to provide a secure \"humanitarian space\" in which aid can operate, but a failure to plan for the aftermath of invasion, when some in Washington believed that troops would be welcomed by grateful Iraqis as liberators, not the occupiers and objects of hostility they have become. So should aid agencies stay? The answer, quite clearly, is no. It is time to stop sacrificing staff in an operation that, from the start, has been so intensely politicised that humanitarian values of independence, neutrality and impartiality are being squeezed out. Aid agencies have become part of the front line. If agencies do go, or at least withdraw the last of their expatriates, the US can hardly complain. The UN, ICRC and aid charities have stuck it out for months amid the increasing mayhem, bombings, shootings, and looting. The UN and its agencies have delivered - literally - everything that could have been expected, including more than 1 million tonnes of food, medical supplies for hospitals and health centres, and supplies for schools. All this work has been carried out without hesitation or complaint, despite the offensive harassment of the UN as an institution by the US president, George Bush, and his acolytes. Similarly, the ICRC has lived up to its reputation for excellence, despite the contempt evident in US government attitudes towards the Geneva conventions on war and those who try to ensure that they are upheld, whether it is the jails of Afghanistan, the holding cells of Baghdad or the cages of Guant\u00ffnamo Bay. Aid agencies debating the US plea to stay must consider not only how many more staff they are prepared to lose, but also what sort of compromises will be required if they are to keep staff alive and operating effectively. Higher walls, more barbed wire, extra armed guards are all needed, of course - but what impact will physical and procedural security steps have on the open, caring and trustful relationship essential for close cooperation with the populations aid workers seek to serve? Power comes from the barrel of a gun, humanitarian aid cannot. Without the figleaf of aid agencies, the challenge for the US will be to fulfil the responsibilities of occupying powers under international law, and meet the needs of the dependent population. If aid groups go, US-favoured private firms may prove equally unwilling to fill the gap with their dead. One factor that could re-emerge is pressure on US non-governmental organisations, a dozen or so of which still have expatriate staff in Iraq. In the past, USAID administrator Andrew Natsios has insisted that those NGOs taking his grants must promote their US funding, a step that, in many parts of the world, can only increase the risks facing them. Mr Natsios has also attempted to control their relations with the media. Will staying to take up the work of other agencies put them in even greater danger? Two eventualities are likely to emerge from this crisis. The first of these is a positive move to hand more power, resources and responsibility to Iraqi aid staff. This should be welcomed, provided that it comes with a commitment to support local staff with training, pay, security and status. Secondly, it is probable that those opposed to US occupation will create their own solidarity agencies to offer food, medicine and education. It will not be humanitarian, but politicised, faith-based, selective and discriminating, but it could rival international efforts and succour further resistance. No aid agency wants to withdraw from a crisis in which people are clearly in need, but an Iraq in which the US is not winning, and cannot deliver the minimum security required by humanitarians, is not a place in which it is acceptable to operate. It is time for aid agencies to tell the US to take responsibility for the mess that it has created. \u00b7 Journalist and media consultant Nick Cater also contributes to humanitarian portal AlertNet.
