Some say that, on the contrary, a government \u2014 and media-led \u2014 \"scrounger\" rhetoric towards disabled people on long-term benefits risks making things worse. A poll by the charity Scope, released on Thursday, said 81% of disabled people had not noticed that attitudes towards them had improved since London 2012, while just over a fifth believed matters had deteriorated. In addition, 84% said they felt the language used in the debate about benefits and disabled people had caused a negative shift in public attitudes. The survey highlights an apparent anomaly after last year's Paralympics, when sellout crowds and widespread public enthusiasm, especially among the young, led to the Games being hailed as the best yet by some distance. The event transformed some Paralympians into celebrities. The sprinter Jonnie Peacock posed for magazines while Stefanie Reid modelled clothes for Debenhams. But another newly famous Paralympian, the triple gold medal-winning dressage rider Sophie Christiansen, says this can mask wider problems. \"There's a very big gap between how the general public perceives Paralympians and how they perceive the rest of the disability community,\" said the 25-year-old, who has cerebral palsy and competes in the category for athletes with the most severe impairment level. \"That's why I try to highlight the difficulties that I have being disabled.\" She added: \"I still have problems in terms of paying for carers, things that people don't realise. People think that because I won three gold medals I've got my life sorted. But I want to highlight what a struggle it is to get there.\" Christiansen said she also worried about the language used about benefits: \"People see disabled people as benefit scroungers. That's a very generalised statement but from the comments I've heard from other disabled people that is how they are viewed.\" From my point of view I think it's got worse, but that might be because other disabled people are telling me about it now, because I'm a public figure.\" Tim Hollingsworth, chief executive of the British Paralympic Association, accepts that for all the stunning successes of London 2012 the organisation remains \"in the foothills\" of what it would like to achieve in terms of changing public attitudes. However, he points to the Games' particular success with younger people. A survey last month for the BBC programme Newsround said that more than half of eight- to 12-year-olds found the Paralympics more inspiring than the Olympics, while almost 70% said the Paralympics had changed their attitudes towards disabled people. He added that the Parasport website, where people can find disability sports clubs, has had 800 more clubs registered since the Paralympics, and an increase in traffic of 300%. \"The true momentum out of London, I hope, will be generational,\" Hollingsworth said. \"I hope we can look back at London as a real catalyst for change in young people's attitudes towards disability. The way our athletes are treated as role models and heroes in schools has been one of the greatest positives to come out of London 2012.\" But it appears that sports specific to the Paralympics such as boccia and sitting volleyball are doing better than integrated sports such as athletics and swimming, because clubs may need equipment and training before they are willing to offer disabled people a chance to practise. \"It's not just the literal things like a ramp for a wheelchair. It's whether the coach and volunteer staff have sufficient understanding of how to provide disability sport,\" he said. \"It's the same in schools. PE teachers in mainstream schools who have disabled children to teach need to be equipped with the tools to do that, in a way they perhaps haven't been.\" It is a worry echoed by the Sport and Recreation Alliance, which \u2013 in the biggest nationwide sports club survey ever conducted in Britain \u2013 found that only one in three are fully accessible to disabled people, while only 8% of volunteers and staff - the linchpin of UK sports clubs - have received training to make their sport more inclusive. \"A lot of the time clubs and volunteers fear making the club or sport accessible will be costly and take a lot of training, but in most cases a small amount of training and equipment can make all the difference,\" said the alliance's chairman, Andy Reed. \"The fact that only three in 10 sports clubs are offering facilities to disabled people after the Paralympics shows that there is no magic bullet. We can get excited about the explosion of interest the Paralympics caused, but for many the effect has yet to filter through.\" The English Federation of Disability Sport has launched a toolkit to make it easier for clubs to be open to everyone, he added. This unique dual role of the Paralympics as both an elite sporting competition and a focus for changing attitudes can be difficult for all concerned. Lady Grey-Thompson, who won 11 gold medals at the Paralympics from 1992 to 2004, and is a regular critic of government policy on disability issues in her new role as a life peer, said the legacy of 2012 was mixed. \"One year on is a celebration of what the Paralympics did for us, and a reminder that London was an amazing moment in time,\" she said. \"But the Paralympics is not the reality of life for disabled people, like the Olympics isn't the reality of life for non-disabled people. There's lots of stuff that's happening for disabled people right now that's not great, but it's hard to compare that to the Paralympics.\"This can prove tricky for some athletes, she adds: \"I was very clear when I was competing that I had no public political view. But Paralympians now are expected to. We don't ask Olympians for their view on Syria. We don't ask black athletes for their view on ethnicity. \"Part of me thinks I would love to politicise a whole pile of Paralympic athletes, educate them in the social model of disability, but that's not what their job is. Their job is to be really good at sport, nothing else.\" Paralympic sports boom Boccia Membership of Boccia England up 60%. Goalball Number of players, officials, coaches and volunteers up 25%. Wheelchair basketball 25% increase at club level across the UK, with 145 new clubs. Wheelchair tennis Number of people participating in sessions up 70% since January 2013.
