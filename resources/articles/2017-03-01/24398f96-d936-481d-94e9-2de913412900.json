The US president signed an executive order on Tuesday aimed at eliminating the clean power plan, Obama\u2019s landmark policy to set limits on the amount of greenhouse gases that power plants emit. America\u2019s commitment to the Paris accord of nearly 200 countries now hangs in the balance. Miguel \u00c1rias Ca\u00f1ete, the EU\u2019s climate action commissioner, said: \u201cWe regret the US is rolling back the main pillar of its climate policy, the clean power plan. Now, it remains to be seen by which other means the United States intends to meet its commitments under the Paris agreement.\u201d He added: \u201cThe continued leadership of the EU, China and many other major economies is now more important than ever. When it comes to climate and the global clean energy transition, there cannot be vacuums, there can only be drivers, and we are committed to driving this agenda forward.\u201d The EU has the most ambitious emissions reduction target, \u00c1rias Ca\u00f1ete said. \u201cWe will stand by Paris, we will defend Paris, and we will implement Paris.\u201d Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said Trump\u2019s action risked putting the US on the back foot. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who wants to breathe dirty air, who wants to worry about their water source, or who wants to leave a dangerous world to their children,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd because we are all united by these common desires, I am optimistic that Paris will endure, with world leadership remaining resilient in its commitments to Paris.\u201d The president\u2019s executive order also throws out the government\u2019s method for counting the benefits of cutting carbon pollution and abandons a moratorium on new coal leases on federal lands. Reaction on Washington\u2019s Capitol Hill broke down along party lines, with Republicans welcoming the move towards energy independence. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, said: \u201cToday\u2019s executive order is based on a fundamental truth: energy drives our economy. President Obama disregarded this, and the result was a barrage of regulations that crippled America\u2019s energy industry. That is all in the past now. President Trump\u2019s executive order will help America\u2019s energy workers and reverse much of the damage done.\u201d The clean power plan had \u201cravaged coal country\u201d, he added, and deserved a \u201cfull repeal\u201d. There was anger and dismay on the opposite side of the aisle as Democrats lined up to knock Trump\u2019s order, with the notable exception of a senator from a coal-friendly state. They accused the president of denying scientific evidence to favour special interests. Chuck Schumer, the minority leader in the Senate, said: \u201cIf there was any doubt that big oil was back in charge under the Trump administration, today\u2019s executive order lays that to rest. It reads as if it was written in an Exxon boardroom, with no regard for the health and safety of the American people, or the planet. \u201cThis executive order is nothing more than a giveaway to big oil at the expense of the health and safety of our children and the bank accounts of hard-working middle-class families. Simply put, the Trump administration has put the health of the American people and the future of our planet on the back burner all for the sake of lining the pockets of big oil and extreme-right special interests.\u201d Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader in the House, said: \u201cPresident Trump and congressional Republicans\u2019 contempt for clean air, clean water, and our clean energy future endangers the health of our children and the strength of our economy. The administration\u2019s spiteful assault on the clean power plan will not bring back jobs to coal country, it will only poison our air and undermine America\u2019s ability to win the good-paying jobs of the future.\u201d Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, noted that global temperature records had been broken over the past three years. \u201cAt a time when we should be urgently investing in clean energy jobs and technology, Trump is giving the worst polluters free rein and pretending it\u2019s all about the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cTrue leadership is a president who had the political courage to move aggressively on carbon polluters, while leaving office with the longest streak of private-sector job growth on record. Instead, we have a president who has called climate change a hoax, picked an ExxonMobil CEO as his secretary of state, put a climate science denier at the head of the EPA, and gives a disgraceful handout to his rich friends in the fossil fuels industry.\u201d Congressman Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, a Democratic member of the Bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus and Bicameral Task Force on Climate Change, warned against a withdrawal from the Paris agreement. \u201cToday\u2019s executive order sends a dangerous signal to the world that the United States does not want to lead in one of the greatest fights of our time: combating global climate change,\u201d he said. The Democratic senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut and the Republican senator Susan Collins of Maine co-authored the Super Pollutants Act of 2015, a bipartisan bill to reduce short-lived climate pollutants in the atmosphere. Murphy said: \u201cFuture generations will judge President Trump for this attack on our health and our safety. The Republican party is going to extraordinary lengths to deny that this meteor that is global warming is careening toward us.\u201d But not for the first time, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a state in coal country that Trump won in a landslide, broke ranks with his Democratic colleagues. \u201cWe need to strike a balance between the environment and the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe clean power plan never achieved that balance. Rolling back this regulation is a positive step towards preventing further job loss, increases to consumer energy bills, and more damage to our economy. We must stop ignoring the damage these regulations caused our energy sector, our economy and our way of life in West Virginia.\u201d Trump\u2019s attack on the clean power plan will not produce instant results. It faces bureaucratic wrangling and legal challenges that could take years. On Tuesday, a coalition of 23 states, cities and counties declared its intention to resist. \u201cWe won\u2019t hesitate to protect those we serve \u2013 including by aggressively opposing in court President Trump\u2019s actions that ignore both the law and the critical importance of confronting the very real threat of climate change,\u201d said the group, led by the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman. Industry groups have expressed scepticism about whether the measures will create employment as Trump claims. Robert Murray, chief executive of Murray Energy, the US\u2019s largest private coal producer, said Trump\u2019s moves were unlikely to significantly increase the number of coal jobs. Chris Wood, CEO of the fishing advocacy group Trout Unlimited, said the executive order would hurt sportsmen, who depend on the resilience of American watersheds, in a multitude of ways. Wood sees the clean power plan as made up of \u201ccommonsense\u201d requirements for the energy industry that protect public land for mixed use. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about hi-tech wizardry here. It was updating rules that hadn\u2019t been touched in 30 to 40 years. It says, hey, treat your frack water once you\u2019re finished with it. Make sure you have hardened concrete casings so they don\u2019t leak. With the repeal of the clean power plan, waterways will not only be more vulnerable to avoidable pollution but also to the varied impacts of climate change. Wood added: \u201cAnyone who has seen these big fires in the west understands the effects on fish.\u201d Watchdogs and pressure groups joined the chorus of condemnation. Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said: \u201cThis is an all-out assault on the protections we need to avert climate catastrophe. It\u2019s a senseless betrayal of our national interests. And it\u2019s a short-sighted attempt to undermine American clean energy leadership. \u201cTrump is sacrificing our future for fossil fuel profits \u2013 and leaving our kids to pay the price. This would do lasting damage to our environment and public lands, threaten our homes and health, hurt our pocketbooks and slow the clean energy progress that has already generated millions of good-paying jobs. \u201cWe won\u2019t surrender our children\u2019s future to fossil fuel profits without a fight.\u201d The alarm was also raised over potential economic consequences. Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a not-for-profit organisation that rallied hundreds of companies to support the clean power plan, said: \u201cBy taking this backward step, the US risks a stalled transition to a low-carbon economy, thus giving China and other countries the upper hand as they embrace renewable energy and other low-carbon technologies that are proliferating all across the globe.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
