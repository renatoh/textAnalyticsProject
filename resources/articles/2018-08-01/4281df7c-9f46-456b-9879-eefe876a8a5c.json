With the new head coach his team encouraged to play from the back, Cech looked uncomfortable on the ball at times against City. He was preferred to the summer arrival Bernd Leno, who joined from Leverkusen for \u00a319.2m. A video of Cech almost scoring an own goal attempting a pass began circulating on Twitter \u2013 with Leverkusen\u2019s English account then getting involved. \u201cWe might know a guy \u2026\u201d they replied to one tweet highlighting Cech\u2019s error, seemingly suggesting their former No 1 would be more adept at implementing the vision of Unai Emery, Arsenal\u2019s new manager. That was followed by a 29-second video of Leno playing out from the back in a game for the German side, with the caption: \u201cIn case you were all wondering how to play out from the back \u2026\u201d Retweeted more than 1,750 times, plenty of supporters of both clubs found the reply humorous, but Cech took to Twitter to post a reply on Monday evening, criticising the \u201cprofessionalism\u201d of the post. \u201c[At] Arsenal we share important values which make us a big club not only on the football side. Fair competition, professionalism and sportsmanship are the biggest \u2026 bayer04-en,\u201d he wrote. Cech spoke after the City game, insisting he is comfortable with the new approach. \u201cYes, you play the best way for the team,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that in a way if you want to dominate the game through possession you need to use every player. You can see at this level that one-v-one is difficult to play so you need to use the goalkeeper as a spare man every time you can - that is the role of the goalkeeper. \u201cIf you play for a team who is happy to play a long-ball and a completely different way then the keeper plays a different way - but for what we want to do I think it is going to be important.\u201d Leverkusen\u2019s account replied to Cech\u2019s tweet soon after - saying their original \u201cjoke\u201d had been taken more personally than it should have been. It read: \u201cHi Petr. It seems our joke about wanting to see Leno, our former player, in action has been taken a bit more harshly/personally than intended. It was only a bit of banter. We\u2019re all for the values you\u2019ve stated and wish you and your big club all the best. Nice 1v1 save on Aguero!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
