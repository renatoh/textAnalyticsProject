On Wednesday night the Dutchman\u2019s side are at the Boleyn Ground for a quarter-final replay after drawing 1-1 with West Ham in the original game. On Sunday Manchester United lost 3-0 at Tottenham Hotspur. The goals came in six second-half minutes \u2013 Van Gaal blamed them on bad communication between Chris Smalling and Daley Blind, his central defenders. The manager is aware that Carroll scored a hat-trick in West Ham\u2019s 3-3 draw with Arsenal on Saturday. \u201cI have seen the Andy Carroll show,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u201cAnd against Spurs I think our problem was also the miscommunication of our central defenders. I hope that we improve our communication because this game is very important for us. It is the last chance of a title, so it is very important for the players, club, manager, fans.\u201d Van Gaal pointed to his team not having as much time to recover for Wednesday\u2019s tie. \u201cWe have one day less than West Ham United,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is also important. We have proved against Arsenal and Manchester City [earlier this season] that in spite of less days to recover we could beat them. I hope we shall recover very well. Also mentally, because this is also a blow of course [losing to Spurs] but everybody knows this is the last chance.\u201d Of Carroll, Van Gaal added: \u201cHe has special qualities. We have seen that in the match that he played on Saturday. It was against Arsenal and they have great central defenders but still he could do that. So we have to cope with Andy Carroll and not only Andy Carroll but with other players. They have a certain player named [Dimitri] Payet \u2013 he can also play. [Manuel] Lanzini can also play and score goals. \u201cOn Sunday we had to cope with Harry Kane but also Christian Eriksen and \u00c9rik Lamela. It is always difficult to cope with players of that level.\u201d United\u2019s defeat left them four points behind Manchester City in the race for a Champions League berth. With only six matches remaining Van Gaal\u2019s side could miss out on a top-four place, so winning the Cup may be the sole way of having a successful season. \u201cI think the players of Manchester United have to cope with that pressure, they have always done it,\u201d said the manager. \u201cThey know that every game in a cup is a match that you have to win. You must win or otherwise you are out of the cup. I think that also West Ham have that problem, so I don\u2019t think it plays a role. Both teams have to cope with that. Both teams know that when you are not winning you are out of the cup and you don\u2019t have any title.\u201d The winners of Wednesday\u2019s match will face Everton in the semi-finals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
