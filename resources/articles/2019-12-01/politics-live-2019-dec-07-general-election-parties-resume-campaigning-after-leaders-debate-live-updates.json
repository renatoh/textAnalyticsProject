Jeremy Corbyn declined to disclose the source of documents used as evidence that the NHS would be \u201con the table\u201d in a post-Brexit UK/US trade deal, after Reddit warned of a link to a Russian interference campaign. The forum issued a statement on Friday night saying that the documents had been posted on their site in late October. \u201cWe investigated this account and the accounts connected to it and today we believe this was part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia,\u201d it said. The Labour leader today declined to respond to a question of where Labour obtained the documents from: We obtained those documents. We believed those documents to be correct and nobody until yesterday denied the correctness of those documents. The issue is there should be no interference in British politics by anybody else. The father of a man killed in the London Bridge attack has accused Boris Johnson of lying and making \u201cpolitical capital\u201d from his son\u2019s death during the BBC leaders\u2019 debate. David Merritt \u2013 whose son Jack was stabbed to death by convicted terrorist Usman Khan \u2013 called the prime minister a fraud following his appearance on Friday night\u2019s TV debate, six days before polling day. \u201cJohnson lied and used our son\u2019s death to make political capital,\u201d Merritt said in a thread posted on Twitter on Saturday. The Conservatives are investigating three parliamentary candidates over antisemitism and are facing calls to suspend them before the election. \u2013 Sally-Ann Hart, standing in the Tory marginal seat of Hastings, shared a video with an image implying that the billionaire George Soros, who is Jewish, controls the EU, and she also liked a Nazi slogan on Facebook. \u2013 Lee Anderson, standing for the Conservatives in Labour-held Ashfield, is an active member of Ashfield Backs Boris, a Facebook group where Soros conspiracy theories have been promoted and which includes supporters of the far-right activist Tommy Robinson. \u2013 Richard Short, the candidate for St Helens South and Whiston, is being investigated for asking whether a Jewish journalist was more loyal to Israel than to Britain. The Labour party has pledged to electrify England\u2019s entire bus fleet by 2030, promising to bring services \u201cinto the future\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn said \u201cthe Westminster bubble\u201d didn\u2019t care about buses, despite the fact that so many people rely on them. He said the Conservatives had overseen the cancellation or reduction of 3,000 routes across the country leaving people \u201cisolated and stuck at home\u201d. His party plans to electrify all of England\u2019s 35,000 buses by 2030, reducing their emissions by 72%, and fund a reverse in the cuts to services as well as creating new ones. Boris Johnson was asked about the case of serial rapist Joseph McCann, after the probation service apologised for \u201cfailings\u201d that enabled him to carry out a series of attacks on women and children. Asked whether anyone in government should take responsibility, he said: I think it\u2019s an absolutely appalling case and shows that there is something very wrong and what we\u2019re going to do is, what I\u2019ve said for a long, long time, is that we want to review the way sentencing takes place and the way sentences are served. And at the moment, the automatic early release at the halfway point for serious sexual and violent offenders is totally wrong, and I said that back in August, and we\u2019re going to stop that. We have a bill ready to go, in parliament, if we can get a working majority on Thursday, we will not only get Brexit done, we will get other things done, including that. (Here is some useful analysis by the Guardian\u2019s home affairs correspondent Jamie Grierson, arguing that the key issue in the McCann case is not actually his initial sentence but its management.) Johnson repeated that he thought terrorists should have to serve their full sentences, following from the London Bridge attack last Friday. I also think that, as I\u2019ve said, the terrorists will serve their full sentence but when it comes to this individual case we have to look at exactly what happened and we have to make sure we do not have a continual habit of early release for really serious sexual and violent offenders. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have rehabilitation, it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do things to ensure you keep people out of prison. You can do all sorts of things to work with young people to get their lives back on track, but when someone commits a serious sexual or violent offence they should not be released early. Such comments today provoked more furious criticism from David Merritt \u2013 whose son Jack was killed in the attack \u2013 who used a thread on Twitter to say the prime minister \u201cused our son\u2019s death to make political capital\u201d. You can read the full story here: While we\u2019re on the topic \u2013 Johnson has been asked again about the parliamentary committee report on potential Russian interference in the EU referendum and the 2017 general election, which he has refused to publish. Well I can repeat what I\u2019ve already said about this, many times, which is that, I know of no evidence of any successful interference by Russia in any democratic event in this country and on the report, we (are) obviously just complying with the normal timetable for releasing such things and I saw no reason to release it earlier just because there was an election going on. Corbyn is speaking about the leaked document on US trade talks, which he says shows the US would demand access to the health market in Britain and access to our public services. He says that the Conservatives are now saying those documents aren\u2019t real. (The Conservative line is actually that the documents don\u2019t show what Labour says they do, not that they are not real.) Corbyn says: A week later they claim that somebody else wrote these documents. Well, it seems a very strange turn of events that, first of all, you get a refusal to publish the documents \u2013 so you get the redacted version, which did confirm that all the meetings had taken place. Then you get the American version, which shows they did take place. Then you get the version which was given to me, which I produced for the public interest, which suddenly, this morning, is apparently an invention by somebody else. I tell you what it\u2019s in their imagination. They are up to their dirty tricks with our NHS, our services, our lives and our market in the future. No Labour government will ever sell our National Health Service. It is simply not for sale. Just to be clear, the suggestion is that the documents were first posted on Reddit by an account which was part of a campaign directed by Moscow. Here\u2019s Reddit\u2019s statement from last night: \u201cWe were recently made aware of a post on Reddit that included leaked documents from the UK. We investigated this account and the accounts connected to it and today we believe this was part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn says he was proud to go to Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s constituency of Chingford and Woodford Green and say that a Labour government would scrap universal credit. He says we need \u201ca real living wage\u201d for all workers, including young workers. On the NHS, Corbyn says that Johnson seemed annoyed yesterday when he mentioned that the Conservatives voted against its creation 41 times. \u201cThe Welsh Labor government has been grotesquely underfunded by the Westminster government,\u201d says Corbyn. It would be so much better with a Labour government in Westminster working with a Labour government in Wales, he says. On the issue of compensating the Waspi women, he says the media often ask him how he can afford the policy. \u201cWell I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s a moral responsibility,\u201d says Corbyn. He says Michael Gove doesn\u2019t like him very much. There are boos from the crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s ok, it\u2019s ok. They don\u2019t call me marmite for nothing,\u201d says Corbyn. He talks about Labour\u2019s plans for a \u201cgreen revolution\u201d. \u201cYou cannot go on watching species being extinct and forests burned in Latin America and West Africa,\u201d he says. He says he wants a Labour government to host COP26 and \u201cto go further and faster then Paris envisaged\u201d. \u201cAt the current rate we won\u2019t reach emissions targets until 2099,\u201d he says. Jeremy Corbyn is talking at an event in Swansea. He\u2019s talking about the linking of music and art with socialist ideas to \u201ccreate the kind of society we want to create\u201d. He pays tribute to his favourite poet, Dylan Thomas, from Swansea. You can watch it live here. Boris Johnson has abandoned a walkabout in Westhoughton, Lancashire, after about 100 protesters took to the town\u2019s high street along with a large screen with a photo of the prime minister with Donald Trump. \u201cHave they just done the UK\u2019s biggest drug deal?\u201d it asked. The PM had planned to meet voters in the marginal Bolton West constituency, taken by the Tories\u2019 Chris Green in 2015 after holding off Labour\u2019s Julie Hilling by just 936 votes in 2017. But after the Tory battle bus arrived in town it was decided that the visit should be abandoned, amid the presence of protesters. The demonstrators, some of whom were from the Socialist Worker newspaper and holding banners saying: \u201cNo to Racism, No to Boris Johnson\u201d, had lined the high street where the walkabout was expected to take place. Instead, Johnson travelled back to London by car after his trip to the north-west on Saturday and his battle bus also headed south. Jo Swinson has insisted she would not quit as leader of the Liberal Democrats leader if the party fails to make significant gains in the general election. Asked if she would stand down in such circumstances, Swinson said: No, because I have just been elected as leader of the Liberal Democrats four months ago with an overwhelming majority. We have got more members than we have ever had before and we are running a strong campaign. So, people have got confidence in my leadership and I\u2019m excited to be doing the job. Boris Johnson has been asked about the issue of a potential Russian link to the NHS documents while on a campaign event in Cheshire. Well I do think we need to get to the bottom of that. As far as I am aware we haven\u2019t yet established the truth about that, but what I certainly think is that document, whatever it was intended to prove, did not prove what Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party hoped it would prove. And I\u2019m afraid it was just another distraction. Jeremy Corbyn has been asked about Reddit\u2019s announcement that documents used by Labour as evidence that the NHS would be on the table in a post-Brexit US trade deal were posted by an account linked to a disinformation campaign directed by Moscow. (See our story here.) He was asked to respond to the suggestion that Labour had either directly or indirectly benefited from a Russian trolling operation. This is such nonsense. This is such an advanced state of rather belated conspiracy theories by the prime minister. When we released the documents, at no stage did the prime minister or anybody deny that those documents were real, deny the arguments that we put forward. And if there has been no discussion with the US about access to our health markets, if all of that is wrong, how come after a week they still haven\u2019t said that? The issues are that those documents show exactly what the British government is doing in discussions with Donald Trump\u2019s administration in the USA and also why the prime minister has refused to release the report on Russian interference in British politics, which he\u2019s been sitting on for a very long time. He refused to say from where the Labour party had obtained the documents. We obtained those documents. We believed those documents to be correct and nobody until yesterday denied the correctness of those documents. The issue is there should be no interference in British politics by anybody else. The prime minister has answers to give, which he refuses to do, about Russian donations to the Tory party or the report that he is sitting on about Russian interference in British politics. Of course there should be no interference in our British political system by Donald Trump or the Russians. More photo ops on the campaign trail. You can watch a live stream of Jeremy Corbyn making a latte on a visit to a cafe in Swansea here: Boris Johnson has been visiting Cheadle, near Stockport, where he attended a junior girls\u2019 soccer match between Hazel Grove United U10s and Poynton Juniors u10s. The PA news agency has been following Nigel Farage on his visit to Sedgefield in County Durham. The Brexit party leader donned a hard hat and protective glasses as he visited the factory of Tolley Fabrications, a company specialising in aluminium, stainless steel and super-duplex fabrications. He was asked by a worker who he trusted most out of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn . \u201cDo you know something, that\u2019s the most difficult question I\u2019ve been asked,\u201d he responded. \u201cI\u2019ve known Boris on and off for 25 years, and he is a likeable, entertaining personality. Would you absolutely trust him? No.\u201d When asked whether the prime minister could be trusted to deliver Brexit, Farage said: \u2018Get Brexit done\u2019 is an attractive line to a country where a lot of people are utterly cheesed off that this has been going on for three-and-a-half years. The idea that somebody\u2019s going to wave a magic wand is very appealing, and if it was true I would support him 100%. But it\u2019s not. If he passes the withdrawal agreement unamended, we go into three more years of agony. It will be Brexit in name only, but we\u2019ll still be stuck with all the European rules and regulations, with no say whatsoever and with a huge bill. Here is the latest piece of polling analysis by Dan Sabbagh, defence and security editor and our resident polling expert for the election. A week to go before the election and the Conservative vote appears to have peaked. The party\u2019s share hit 42% about a fortnight ago and has not advanced since \u2013 a level that is intriguingly similar to the 42.34% result achieved by Theresa May in the last general election. The party now dominates the leave vote \u2013 with a 69% share, according to ICM\u2019s analysis published this week \u2013 following the effective surrender of Nigel Farage in the early part of the campaign. Essentially, the Conservatives\u2019 five-point improvement during the campaign has been almost entirely at the Brexit party\u2019s expense. Friends of the Earth has judged that Labour has the most impressive environmental policies of any of the main UK-wide political parties. The organisation examined the manifestos of the Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrats and Green parties and scored each against their election asks, which covered 10 areas, including climate targets, energy, transport, food and nature. The manifestos were marked out of 45. They said: The final assessment saw Labour, Lib Dems and Greens all marked highly, but with the Labour party given a slightly higher score overall. The Conservative party scored poorly: its manifesto was judged to be missing significant commitments in numerous areas, inadequate policies in others, and actively damaging policies in transport. Here were the final scores: Labour: 33 Green: 31 Liberal Democrat: 30 Conservatives: 5.5 Dave Timms, Friends of the Earth\u2019s head of political affairs, said: Environmental issues have been given greater priority in this election than ever before \u2013 and with the world in the midst of an ecological and climate crisis this must be the next government\u2019s top priority. Many of the policies that Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Green party have put forward are commensurate with, or striving to meet, the challenges we face. It is disappointing we have not yet seen the same urgency, ambition or consistency from the Conservative party. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, has also been on both the Today programme and Sky News. He\u2019s been setting out Labour\u2019s plans to electrify England\u2019s entire bus fleet. You can read the story here: In the light of claims that UK government documents leaked online \u2013 and used by Labour to hammer home their argument about NHS vulnerability in post-Brexit US/UK trade talks \u2013 could have been subject to Russian interference, McDonald said it would be perfectly legitimate to hold an inquiry. I think that\u2019s perfectly legitimate. I think what interests me particularly is the content of the documents. He called on the government to publish the report by parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee (ISC) into possible Russian interference in the UK democratic process. If we want to get to the bottom of the extent to which the Russian state interferes in elections, can we please publish the Intelligence and Security Committee report? Let\u2019s get that out there. That should have been published ages ago. Here\u2019s a roundup of what is happening on the campaign trail today. Today is \u201csmall business Saturday\u201d, so expect the party leaders to be setting out their offerings to small business owners. Boris Johnson is visiting north-west England, although his exact plans have not yet been disclosed. Jeremy Corbyn takes the Labour campaign to Wales, touring the country and appearing at a rally. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson will visit Hertfordshire to discuss her policies with small businesses to try to convince them to back her party. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, travels to Sedgefield in County Durham, where he will also meet business representatives. The outgoing culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, has been speaking to broadcasters this morning about the Conservative party\u2019s pledge to invest \u00a3550m in grassroots football. (You can read the BBC story here.) She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that it was \u201cextremely serious\u201d that leaked documents \u2013 used by Labour to claim that the US wanted NHS to be included in future trade deals \u2013 could be linked to a Russian disinformation campaign. You can read the background here: I understand from what was being put on that website, those who seem to know about these things say that it seems to have all the hallmarks of some form of interference. And if that is the case, that obviously is extremely serious. And actually as culture secretary, obviously one of the things that we are looking for and monitoring is any interference in our elections. She was later asked by Sky News why, if they were so concerned about Russian interference, had No 10 blocked the publication of a report examining the country\u2019s infiltration of British politics. She said it had been a matter of timing and the speed with which parliament had been dissolved. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a parliament to publish that report to,\u201d she said. All I can say is the government, obviously, is taking steps. We are very aware of the potential for overseas interference and watching very carefully through lots of different channels as to what potentially might be going on. Here\u2019s a video of the highlights from last night\u2019s debate \u2013 Good morning and welcome to the politics live blog on the morning after Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson went head-to-head in a BBC debate. The party leaders clashed over Islamophobia and antisemitism in their parties, with both accusing the other of \u201ca failure of leadership\u201d. Johnson said: \u201cI think that Mr Corbyn\u2019s handling of this particular issue, his unwillingness to take a stand and stand up for Jewish people in the Labour party and put an arm round them is a failure of leadership.\u201d Corbyn hit back: \u201cA failure of leadership is when you use racist remarks to describe people from different countries or in our society. I will never do that \u2026 I hope that the prime minister understands the hurt that people feel when they hear remarks and articles he has written.\u201d You can read the full write-up from the Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor, Rowena Mason, and political correspondent Kate Proctor here. And political correspondent Peter Walker has an assessment of who won the debate here. A snap poll from YouGov found 52% of Britons asked after watching the debate believed Johnson won and 48% Corbyn. The pollster said it fell within the margin of error and so could be considered another draw. Those surveyed said Corbyn was more trustworthy than Johnson by 48% to 38% but Johnson was considered more prime ministerial by 54% to 30%. We have fact-checked claims made by the two party leaders.
