In it, Keaton\u2019s character is showing the architect\u2019s daughter the views from the top when a strike is called, workers down tools, power is cut from the lift and the pair find themselves stranded. Like a modernist Robinson Crusoe, the plot then follows the pair trying to get attention from people in nearby buildings to no avail before building a shelter, and developing strategies to catch rainwater to drink and pigeons to eat. It came to mind today when I saw the CGI renders of Infinity Pool, a speculative-proposal-cum-clickbait-marketing-stunt from swimming pool designer Compass Pools. The alluring images show the entire roof of an unnamed central-London tower given over to an infinity pool, with no apparent means of escape, as if the digital people are in some kind of sublime prison cell for the super rich. We are assured there is in fact a way in and out, courtesy of a \u201crotating spiral staircase which rises from the pool floor\u201d, and that this is an entirely buildable proposition that includes an inbuilt anemometer to \u201cvary the water level and access to the pool\u201d. The designer, Alex Kemsley, said, \u201cthe building started life as a design concept to push engineering boundaries and literally punch for the sky\u201d and added that there has been \u201csignificant global interest\u201d including talks with developers and a luxury hotel chain. But don\u2019t expect to see it in the capital. Kemsley tells me that while London would be his preferred location, \u201csince the story has broken\u201d he has entered talks for a similar project in Dubai. This Infinity Pool appearing in the City of London is about as likely as a pool being fitted in the restored Notre Dame Cathedral, but clickbait images such as this get huge traction \u2013 so it\u2019s worth interrogating what they represent for a changing city. In 2015, Redrow Homes released a promotional film for a high-rise luxury development in Docklands, quickly pulled after public disgust and mockery. The suited man who seemed to live in the aspirational apartment walked to his window, looked over London and declared: \u201cThey say nothing comes easy, but if it was easy, then it wouldn\u2019t feel as good. To look out at the city that could have swallowed you whole, and say, \u2018I did this.\u2019 To stand with the world at your feet.\u201d There was something deeply dystopian about the advert, calling to mind the \u201cdiscreet oligarchy of minor tycoons and entrepreneurs\u201d who lived on the top five floors of the building in JG Ballard\u2019s High Rise. In a foreshadowing of poor doors and private playgrounds, Ballard\u2019s jet-set residents had their own \u201chigh-speed elevators and superior services\u201d, and as more luxury towers with multi-million pound penthouses crop up, London is becoming two concurrent cities, where rich and poor not only fail to rub shoulders but \u2013 through the use of height as separation \u2013 don\u2019t even see one another. We exist in what Stephen Graham called, in his recent book Vertical, an \u201celite takeover of the urban skies\u201d. Peter Cook, of the architecture firm Archigram, once said: \u201cThe skyscraper is still the stuff of heroes. Superman and Superwoman can aspire to the executive floor, or even higher. The only problem as a designer is how to make your tall box different from the rest.\u201d As towering buildings pop up across Britain\u2019s capital (the recently published Tall Buildings Survey suggests 541 are in the pipeline), Cook\u2019s adage becomes more true. Starting with the Shard\u2019s \u00a324.95 view across London, viewing platforms have become synonymous with the boom in tower building. Then developers saw how such a \u201cpublic offer\u201d may help smooth planning applications, witnessed with the Sky Garden public park \u2013 which is neither public nor a park \u2013 and arguably more a corporate entertainment space than anything benefiting Londoners. Every tower from Vauxhall to Docklands now seems to have some potted trees at its top, occasionally even with public benefit but usually solely as a statement offer for overpriced flats frequently sold to offshore investors. Following this, developers saw value in topping their creations with quirky, marketable attractions. Then came the swimming pools. The Sky Pool, a transparent acrylic swimmable bridge between two luxury rooftop gardens in Nine Elms, led to equal measures of public excitement and disgust depending on your view of such technological \u201cprogress\u201d. In this newspaper, Oliver Wainwright predicted that the Sky Pool would become a \u201ctorrent\u201d, and Infinity Pool is the latest evidence that he may just be right. The addiction of sticking such playful propositions higher into the clouds reached an absurd peak last year with Norman Foster\u2019s proposed Tulip. A tower of glass and steel (and unacceptable levels of embedded carbon) with no function whatsoever other than supporting a restaurant, rotating gondolas, and a glass slide. Buster Keaton and Robert Sherwood\u2019s skyscraper story never got made. The pair couldn\u2019t contrive a believable way for the characters to escape from the building that also incorporated enough of Keaton\u2019s pratfalls. Might it be that we are in a similar situation with architectural propositions like the Infinity Pool?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
