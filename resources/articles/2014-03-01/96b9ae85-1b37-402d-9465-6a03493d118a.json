All were non-Victorian sides, and it was also the first time that Greater Western Sydney and Gold Coast have won games in the same round. For them to start so well against decent opponents is huge for both clubs, and they can cherish the 100% win rate while it lasts. For their part, neither Port Adelaide nor Fremantle were exactly underdogs, but plenty expected Port to dip this year after their Lazarus effort in 2013, and after spending much of the game four goals down they did look done for. As for Freo, we worried about a grand final hangover, a possible slow start, and a tough first game in Melbourne, but they beat Collingwood like swatting a bug. Hayden Ballantyne embodied this, forgetting his dire grand final in being one of the best on ground. When the Giants presumptuously took the lead from Sydney in the last quarter, and when Richmond drew ahead of Gold Coast, you expected the experienced sides to fire up and finish things off, but it was not to be. Gary Ablett kicking that last goal, and the shot of him pumping his fist in front of a sea of red and gold, will be long replayed. And spare a thought for Andrew Demetriou: the expansion sides have been the AFL boss\u2019s twin babies, and a couple of weeks after he announced his impending retirement, they started his last season in grand style. 2) Fab Fours don\u2019t mean much in a game of 22 Such punditry support as Collingwood have received ahead of season 2014 has centred on their elite midfield. If you glanced at the stats from Friday night you\u2019d think it had gone well: Dayne Beams, Dane Swan, Scott Pendlebury and Luke Ball all had 25 or more disposals, and kicked 2.2 between them, while Collingwood won the clearances and contested possessions. Not so: their side got smashed in inside-50s, and kicked 5.16 in front of goal. It basically came down to disposal efficiency: for all their numbers, Ball was using the footy at 52%, Swan at 55, Beams at 64 and only Pendlebury up at 69. Ten of his teammates had an efficiency rate of 68% or better, as opposed to 17 Dockers. 3) GWS can match it with the big guns It wasn\u2019t that the Giants won \u2013 any team has to jag a win here and there. It was the fact that they out-Swanned the Swans, an inspirational level of play for a young side. Choking defensive pressure did the job for the final three quarters after an early rain deluge. The younger side were in contests and in faces, fully confident, with a particular intensity toward Lance Franklin, who punished in the tackle at every opportunity. There were so many instances. Defensive pressure caused turnovers in the Sydney half-back line all night. There was Jeremy Cameron outhustling three Swans running back with the ball to score a left-foot snap from 45, and Nick Malceski being run down five metres from his defensive goal. Phil Davis nearly killed himself on the three-quarter time siren to deny Franklin a shot, Sam Frost injured his shoulder laying a massive tackle but played on to score late, and Lachie Whitfield surged back into the game after an umpiring nightmare. New recruits Josh Hunt and Shane Mumford were immense, and all this was after Rhys Palmer\u2019s hamstring injury forced the Giants to activate their substitute early in the game. They still finished full of running, not just scraping home to win by a few points, but ramming five goals past the Swans after taking the final-quarter lead, ensuring there would be no sniff of a comeback. 4) The best commentary is unintentional I think it was Dwayne Russell producing the most interesting calls of the round, though by halfway through the Gold Coast and Richmond game I was semi-delirious with expansion team success. \u201cSwallow, Ablett, all the stars from Gold Coast around the footy,\u201d he said, in an assessment which you could argue is not inaccurate for a developing side. Then there was the inadvertent nautical theme: as the Suns cleared defence we heard, \u201cNow May, to steady the ship and find\u2026 Day.\u201d 5) The worst scheduling ever? As great as some of those results were, the AFL can take as much credit for that as a hack golfer nailing a hole-in-one. Round 1 this year is a weird hodge-podge, exemplified by nothing more than the fact that we\u2019re only halfway through it. Starting over two weeks was a bizarre call, even with some issues around unavailable grounds. Rather than worrying about rugby codes and media coverage, the AFL should look to start with feast of footy, a glut, a trough for us to get our dirty snouts into. Then there was the scheduling: there\u2019s hardly inherent excitement or intrigue or historical friction in a contest between Port and Carlton, or Fremantle and Collingwood, or West Coast and the Bulldogs, or Geelong v Adelaide at Kardinia Park on a Thursday night. Blue-chip games don\u2019t necessarily have to start the season \u2013 you do want teams to be playing well and building anticipation before you turn on a Perth derby or pit Hawthorn against Geelong. But the closest we had to a grudge match was Richmond v Gold Coast, the Tigers\u2019 recent bogey side. Lucky the Suns made it interesting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
