Many supermarket own-brands use the voluntary colour-coded scheme, but Which? says giant manufacturers like Kellogg\u2019s are lagging behind, and leaving consumers trying to eat more healthily faced with a bewildering array of nutritional data and portion sizes. Its researchers analysed 31 cereals, porridges and granolas and found they could contain more than three-quarters of an adult\u2019s recommended daily maximum of free sugars in one portion \u2013 with the true sugar level not reflected on the packaging. Kellogg\u2019s Frosties and Kellogg\u2019s Crunchy Nut Cornflakes contained the most sugar per 100g \u2013 a whopping 37g and 35g each, which is about the same per 100g as Burton\u2019s Wagon Wheels. Further confusion could result from companies changing the portion sizes on their packaging or, in the case of Nestl\u00e9, making comparison with other brands difficult by including a measure of milk in its front-of-pack nutritional information. Which? says consumers would be better served if all manufacturers used the traffic light labelling scheme, which shows whether levels of sugar, salt and fat are high, medium or low using red, amber and green traffic light colours \u2013 and is based on the amount per 100g. This would make it easier to compare across products, regardless of the portion size suggested. Under European Union rules this kind of labelling on the front of packs is only voluntary. Which? is calling on the government to use Brexit as an opportunity \u2013 once EU laws are switched to British law \u2013 to introduce legislation that makes traffic light labelling mandatory in the drive to improve health and wellbeing. The NHS states that more than 22.5g of total sugars per 100g is high and 5g of total sugars or less per 100g is low. \u201cIt is clear that the current, non-standardised food labelling system is at best confusing and at worst misleading,\u201d said Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services. A spokesperson for Kellogg\u2019s UK and Ireland, said: \u201cWe recognise we have a role to play in helping people make healthier choices. That is why at the end of last year we announced our most ambitious plan to overhaul our cereals, including a 40% reduction in the amount of sugar in Coco Pops, taking high sugar Ricicles off supermarket shelves and launching a range of vegan, organic and no-added sugar granolas. \u201cWe know there is more we can do, which is why we are always looking at ways of giving people more of what they want in our cereals, like wholegrain and fibre, and less of what they don\u2019t like.\u201d The cereals lowest in sugar were Nestle Shredded Wheat, which contained no added sugar, and Weetabix Original which contained 4.4g sugar per 100g. Plain porridge was also a healthy choice, with Quaker Oat So Simple and Ready Brek Original Porridge both containing 1g sugar per 100g."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
