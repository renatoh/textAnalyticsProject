It is hoped they will raise in excess of \u00a34m. There has long been the will among the league\u2019s players to support the National Health Service financially \u2013 together with other key areas of need \u2013 and, after a good deal of time and coordination in bringing the vision together, they have partnered with NHS Charities Together [NHSCT] in order to do so. The fund will be administered by Liverpool\u2019s Jordan Henderson, Manchester United\u2019s Harry Maguire, Watford\u2019s Troy Deeney and West Ham\u2019s Mark Noble. A player statement read: \u201cThe contributions that this initiative will generate will help NHSCT quickly grant funds to the front line to support in a number of ways, including to help enhance the wellbeing of NHS staff, volunteers and patients impacted by Covid-19.\u201d Acting as representatives for their squads, the captains have spent recent days in conference calls \u2013 the latest of which began at midday on Wednesday \u2013 and they had a variety of issues to confront. One of them was how to pitch the level of the contributions from each squad, with everybody mindful that some earn rather more than others, and to ensure that those who cannot give as much are not made to look less generous. The proposed solution is for each squad\u2019s donation to arrive anonymously into the central fund, which will be distributed locally and nationally. Unsurprisingly, the players wanted their money to work in hospitals near to their clubs, although there was the added complication of overseas players wanting to do their bit for their home countries. Distribution percentages from the fund were a key topic. Each captain has tried \u2013 after discussions with teammates \u2013 to fix a base percentage of their monthly pay packets to give, although if anybody can contribute more then that would be gratefully received. The talks initially targeted players\u2019 take-home for April and May. Players at some clubs are under pressure to accept pay cuts from their chairmen, with Daniel Levy at Tottenham, for example, having said he wants members of his squad to do \u201ctheir bit for the football ecosystem\u201d in the face of an unprecedented crisis. But the Guardian understands that whereas all squads will gladly contribute to the fund overseen by the captains, which allows for greater control over where the money will go, some will not accept pay reductions. In a further charity initiative by players, Common Goal has announced the launch of its Covid-19 response fund. It aims to help tackle the pandemic\u2019s immediate effects among young and vulnerable people in deprived communities, before ensuring support continues beyond the initial response. Common Goal \u2013 a global project whose members include Juan Mata, J\u00fcrgen Klopp and Megan Rapinoe \u2013 is a movement through which footballers and coaches pledge 1% of their earnings to organisations that drive social change. It works with community bodies in 90 countries. \u201cTo overcome coronavirus, and the other challenges facing humanity, we need to coordinate individual efforts and work together as a team,\u201d said Mata, who launched Common Goal in 2017. \u201cI\u2019m urging not only my Common Goal teammates, but also all other players and football leaders from around the world, to unite and help tackle this crisis.\u201d The fund is also open to people outside the football industry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
