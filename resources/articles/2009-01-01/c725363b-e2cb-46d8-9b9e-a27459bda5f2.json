The House vote came after days of intense lobbying by the new president, including personal appeals to congressional Republicans. The minority party's legislatorss spurned Obama, however, saying the bill contained too much spending and not enough tax cuts. Democrats argued that the bill was imperative with the economy in the worst shape since the Great Depression during the 1930s. The legislation includes an estimated $544bn in federal spending and $275bn in tax cuts for individuals and businesses. It includes money for highway construction and mass transit. The Senate is working on a costlier version of the bill."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
