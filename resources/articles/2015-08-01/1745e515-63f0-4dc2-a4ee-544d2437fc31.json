In July, a gunman killed himself after killing two at a screening of Trainwreck in Lafayette, Louisiana. Earlier this month, in Nashville, Tennessee, a man was shot and killed at a showing of Mad Max: Fury Road, after he attacked moviegoers with pepper spray and a hatchet. Both events occurred in the wake of James Holmes\u2019s 2012 shooting rampage, that took the life of 12 people and injured 70 more, during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado. He was sentenced to life in prison last week. \u201cSecurity issues have become a daily part of our lives in America. Regal Entertainment Group wants our customers and staff to feel comfortable and safe when visiting or working in our theatres,\u201d the chain said in a statement. Regal acknowledged that this new procedure is not without its flaws, but that it hopes they\u2019re \u201cminor in comparison to increased safety\u201d. The chain, based in Knoxville, Tennessee, is the first to institute a bag check policy. Up until now, the exhibition industry has been largely silent on security measures. In the wake of the two most recent attacks on movie theaters, Variety reports that nearly half of ticket buyers are willing to pay more to improve security measures via the costly installation of metal detectors, and hiring of armed security guards. According to a new survey conducted by consumer research film C4, following the Nashville incident, 48% of moviegoers are willing to pay $1 or more per ticket for the additional measures. Nineteen per cent of respondents said they would pay $3 or more. Last weekend, Universal Pictures partnered with exhibitors that requested support during screenings of Straight Outta Compton, the hit drama that centres on gangsta rap group NWA."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
