From stately home to the chaos of Dunkirk, director Joe Wright and scripter Christopher Hampton's grip never falters, in a deeply compassionate tale of love, class and war. Wild at Heart 10pm, Sky Movies Indie (David Lynch, 1990) Nicolas Cage's petty crook, Sailor Ripley, and Laura Dern's Lula are lovers on the run through a weird American south, stalked by a hitman hired by mother-in-law-from-hell Diane Ladd. A road movie with a vengeance, it's full of Lynch's demonic humour, energy and violence, and won the Palme d'Or at Cannes. The Descent 10.45pm, Film4 (Neil Marshall, 2005) The first half is a claustrophobic, panicky story of six women climbers trying to scrabble their way out of a deep cave in the Appalachians ... then the mutant cannibals show up. The tension ratchets up almost unbearably, and there's no time for the black humour Marshall brought to his werewolf fest Dog Soldiers - it's very dark, nasty and frightening down there."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
