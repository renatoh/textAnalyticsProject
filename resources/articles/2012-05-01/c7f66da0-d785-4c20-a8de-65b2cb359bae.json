Zero! Never even thought about it.\" The audience loved this. If there's anything that Birmingham appreciates, it's the truth about its manifold charms. \"What is this place?\" he asked later. \"The National Indoor Arena? What a beautiful name. Why don't they just call it the Shelter?\" If only he had carried on being rude, about the new central library or Alex McLeish's glum stewardship of Aston Villa, the city would have loved him more, but that was as much local colour as Seinfeld did. This was one of only two British gigs: Manchester will suffer on Saturday night. Jerry Seinfeld could afford to scorn his hosts. He so didn't need this. He's the world's most successful comedian, rich enough to have a private jet and so many Porsches in his New York garage he can't remember how many he's collected. And this is the guy, ironically, whose 90 minutes of observational comedy were premised on mere Brummies having some experiential connection with him. But he wasn't the only one who didn't want to be here. \"When you got the tickets it seemed like a good idea,\" he told us. Now not so much. Seinfeld imagined what we were all thinking in the pub before the show: \"To hell with the show. I hate this guy. He's ruining my night.\" The bond of self-disgust and loathing for our situation established, Seinfeld slipped into the observational routine that's served him well for three decades. He gagged about coffee, caller ID, iPad 3, how old people eat disgustingly, why restaurants are all about the drizzling, that thing women do in arguments with their partners \u2013 the whole schmeer of fatuous modern civilisation. It was all delivered frenetically and with fine timing, but with a scary Tom Cruise-in-Tropic-Thunder vibe. For a city raised on the less clamorous comedy stylings of Ted Chippington, though, Seinfeld's excitable neurotic fare was too excitable. Decaff from now on, Jerry, OK? Facebook got it: \"That's the final whoring out of the word 'book', I'll say that.\" Ouch. Do you think Twitter escaped? No. Email? Come on! After an hour and a half in his trivia-obsessed head, to be sure, I yearned for a more substantial and quieter comedian. Solihull's Stewart Lee, for instance. I enjoyed Seinfeld on the new Viagra in the States, which gives US men the high-class problem of four-hour erections. Seinfeld described them arriving at the emergency room in ponchos to conceal their embarrassing perma-tumescences. The woman next to me was in bits. Ponchos! Seinfeld has been doing this observational schtick since the age of 27, when he hit the big time on the Johnny Carson Show, and then for 10 years in the Seinfeld sitcom. Yes, he has been eclipsed by the co-creator of Seinfeld, Larry David, whose Curb your Enthusiasm is darker than anything in Seinfeld's philosophy, but this show proves he can still do that thing he used to do \u2013 but with reference to our more recent fatuities. There was new stuff about conjugal felicity \u2013 the very thing Seinfeld programmatically disdained a decade ago. He even did a bit about nocturnal visits from his five-year-old son. \"It's like waking next to a laundry bag with a live border collie in it.\" I've so been there. This is the guy, I thought angrily even as I laughed, who made Michael McIntyre possible and perhaps even worse made Frankie Boyle McIntyre's necessary comedic corrective. But he's less oleaginous than the former, less toxic than the latter and sharper than both. I'm not sure why he did, but I'm glad he came to Birmingham, England. \"Thanks for inviting us to your beautiful city,\" he bawled as we applauded. Always with the jokes, Jerry. You know you don't mean it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
