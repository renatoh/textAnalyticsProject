As the prime minister headed to the Azores islands in the Atlantic for an emergency summit with George Bush, the US president, and Jose Maria Aznar, the Spanish prime minister, Blair loyalists played down fears of a meltdown in Labour party support. Peter Hain, the Welsh secretary, acknowledged that there was a \"lot of unease\" in the party, but dismissed reports of Labour party members ripping up membership cards as \"extravagant exaggeration\". According to a YouGov survey, 60% disagreed with Britain's participation in war unless a new UN motion is passed, down from 73% at the end of January. The chances of winning a second resolution are looking increasingly bleak given the entrenched opposition of France, Russia, Germany and China on the UN security council. Gordon Brown weighs in The US and Britain have primed their respective publics for a war without a second resolution by arguing that resolution 1441, approved unanimously last November, provided enough legal basis for a strike against Baghdad. Top US and British officials from Colin Powell, the US secretary of state, to Gordon Brown, the chancellor, all made the point on the chat shows today. Mr Brown said that the government was \"satisfied\" that 1441 provided full legal authority for war, echoing statements made yesterday by Jack Straw, the foreign secretary. The formidable Mr Brown went to bat for the prime minister in a show of cabinet unity amid threats of resignation from Clare Short, the international development secretary, who has accused Mr Blair of recklessness, and, less overtly from Robin Cook, the leader of the Commons. Mr Brown dismissed reports that Mr Cook was ready to quit the cabinet. \"There are discussions in the cabinet,\" Mr Brown said. \"It's not for me to report them. But the one thing I can tell you is that Robin Cook has not announced that he is going to resign, that is speculation. Equally with Clare Short, that is speculation.\" Mr Brown described Ms Short's position as not that far from the prime minister's stance. \"Clare Short agrees that Saddam Hussein is a threat,\" Mr Brown said. \"She agrees that he's not complying. She agrees that he hasn't actually removed his weaponry. She agrees that international action is necessary, and she agrees of course that if there were to be military action, the reconstruction of Iraq ... should take place under the auspices of the UN.\" The chancellor held out the possibility of a vote in the Commons depending on the outcome of the Azores summit. \"I think there will be a vote, but I can't say exactly what the outcome of the discussions are going to be,\" Mr Brown said. Even as cabinet officials argued that opinion was swinging towards the government, Labour dissenters predicted a bigger Labour rebellion in the event of a vote. Chris Smith, a former cabinet minister, said that many of the MPs who voted with the government last month would now have doubts about backing the government. \"It is possible that the rebellion might be bigger because the central issue now is going to war without UN authorisation,\" Mr Smith said, although he denied that Mr Blair's future as Labour leader was at stake. Tony Lloyd, a former Foreign Office minister, predicted that this time up to 160 of the 411 Labour MPs would rebel, compared with 122 last month. The support of the Conservatives and of Labour members in government would still ensure Mr Blair a majority. Tories and Liberal Democrats Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative leader, has pledged support for Mr Blair. He told his party's spring conference in Harrogate it was not time to play party politics to his party's spring conference. But Charles Kennedy, leader of the Liberal Democrats, who opposes war without UN approval, launched a strong attack against Mr Blair's Iraq policy. Speaking at the Liberal Democrat party conference in Torquay, Mr Kennedy accused Mr Blair of betraying the legacy of former Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell, who opposed military action in Suez in 1956. \"I've never questioned Tony Blair's sincerity, but I do question his judgment,\" Mr Kennedy said. Mr Kennedy was equally critical of the Bush administration, asserting that the Bush administration's determination to pursue \"regime change\" in Iraq was not backed by international law and would boost terrorist groups. \"The more the United States pursues this doctrine, the more chance there is it will increase rather than diminish the threat of international terrorism,\" Mr Kennedy said. \"It is easy to see the terrorists exploiting the post-war situation. They will recruit more easily and more freely if governments are destabilised and resentment is swelling against the west.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
