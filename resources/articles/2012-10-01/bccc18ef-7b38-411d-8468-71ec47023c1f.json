Not many of them have an obvious Beatles connection, but there's always been more than a hint of Yellow Submarine about the music and artwork of Lemon Jelly's Fred Deakin, who plays an audio-visual set here. Ashley Beedle promises a psychedelic funk DJ turn, plus there's stuff from acid house survivor Justin Robertson and electro excursions from Si Begg. Hackney Picturehouse, E8, Sat Sam Richards Chibuku Shake Shake, Liverpool It's difficult to fathom how Liverpool has ended up with a club scene as lacking as it is presently. The closure of highly-dependable alternative venue Le Bateau earlier this year didn't help and it followed others, like Ladytron's Korova bar, out of business. There is, however, room for celebration this weekend as Cream celebrates 20 years of raving on Saturday night and Chibuku returns home to The Masque (another venue that had to close temporarily) after almost a year away. Whether the dominance of the monthly student favourite improves matters or stifles other nights is a hotly debated topic in the city, but with little competition its importance is greater than ever. Techno forms the backbone of the homecoming with Berghain resident Ben Klock being joined in the Theatre by Mosca and Blawan, plus drum'n'bass upstairs from Andy C, who celebrates 20 years of Ram Records. The Masque, Seel St, Sat Marc Rowlands Barrio 54, Belfast Back in Belfast for the third outing of Barrio 54, the Derry collective of musicians and DJs have billed the night as The Palm Wine Special. Rather than referring to a particularly exotic drinks promotion, the titular palm wine is actually a West African musical style \u2013 also known as maringa in Sierra Leone \u2013 named after a beverage popular at the kind of gatherings which spawned the genre's combination of local melodies and Trinidadian calypso. Tonight's acts promise to deliver more tropical colour and flavours than Carmen Miranda's head-dress, with plenty of equatorial rhythms generated by DJs mixing it up alongside live musicians, but with that all-important disco twist. Ghanaian funk and South African boogie merge with DJ Brasilia's Afro-Latin rhythms, while Bounce's head honcho KwaMe provides a US east coast-meets-West African Cape disco playlist. Ronnie Scott's regular Kaidi Tatham plays live, MC Leroy Culture is on the mic and drummer and dancer Thomas Annang makes his Barrio 54 debut. The Menagerie, University Street, Sat Patric Baird Alpha-ville Live, London October is a good month for avant garde electronica: Tim Hecker and Kevin Drumm play Birmingham's Supersonic festival, Apparat and the New Radiophonic Workshop feature at the Southbank Centre, and Aphex Twin brings his Remote Orchestra show to the Barbican. First off, there's Alpha-ville Live, featuring a collaborative performance between electronic soundscaper Murcof and Simon Geilfus of the visual collective AntiVJ. Also on an audio-visual tip is Byetone, from the German minimal powerhouse Raster-Noten, plus the celestial loops of Kompakt's Axel Willner AKA The Field. Hackney Empire, E8, Sat SR Shakedown Festival, Brighton Shakedown will be using two of Europe's biggest tents for their 10,000-strong bash \u2013 hence its (possibly optimistic?) billing as a \"weatherproof festival\". But frankly, the lineup's of such eye-popping proportions that even the most pooped outdoor party person must surely don their wellies one more time. For starters, there's the likes of headliner Dizzee Rascal, Michael Gove-lookalike Professor Green, a DJ set from dubstep crossovers Chase And Status plus Radio 1's Zane Lowe.
