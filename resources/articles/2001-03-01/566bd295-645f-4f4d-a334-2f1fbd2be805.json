But for the first time this season his Derby side, having leapfrogged Everton and Aston Villa into the relative sanctuary of 14th position, can look at the Premiership table without the need to wince. With another two wins the restoration job will have been completed and top-flight status confirmed, a remarkable transformation for a side who in mid-November were still waiting for their first Premiership win. Since Colin Todd brought his coaching nous into the equation and Taribo West swapped la dolce vita of Milan for an East Midlands motel, Derby have been unrecognisable from the dishevelled outfit that were aimlessly grubbing around for points through the autumn. Watching them inflict what was ultimately irretrievable first-half damage on Tottenham, there were times when their early-season angst seemed little more than a trick of the mind. For Spurs, reality bites hard. It is no surprise that a man of George Graham's legendary conservatism builds his team around a compact defence but, when that is malfunctioning, there is little left over to admire. In midfield Tim Sherwood and Steffen Freund are one-paced and one-dimensional. Without Darren Anderton and the attack-minded wing-back Stephen Carr the team is too often bereft of width and penetration. In Les Ferdinand and the on-loan Andy Booth their attack on Saturday comprised one striker who, it could be argued, is rapidly going over the hill and another who never made it up the slope in the first place. A plethora of up-and-coming stars suggests better times ahead but this was a galling day for Alton Thelwell, culpable for Branko Strupar's 33rd-minute penalty after making a pig's ear of controlling a high ball and subsequently up-ending Malcolm Christie in his desperation to retrieve the situation. \"I'll be having a chat with Alton to let him know that just because he is in the first team it does not mean he is the finished article,\" growled Graham. The Spurs manager is also to have further talks with Enic about its blueprint for the club, not least in the wake of a public admission yesterday that the new owner is considering a move from White Hart Lane. \"We are looking at whether we need a purpose-built stadium which will have a better chance of housing all the fans who cannot get into matches,\" said the new executive vice-chairman David Buchler. First things first, however. Most Tottenham fans would prefer to oversee the construction of a new team rather than a new ground. Derby led from the 12th minute, Strupar volleying in a flicked-on corner to claim his first goal since returning from two hernia operations. Though the home side invited trouble by defending too deeply in the second half Tottenham lacked any kind of ingenuity. They were all huff and puff but no guile. A blooper by the otherwise impeccable West, heading Sol Campbell's harmless punt over Andy Oakes, was the first Premiership goal Derby had conceded in more than six hours but, with the odd flutter here and there, they survived some concerted pressure to propel themselves within touching distance of safety. \"Two more wins,\" nodded Todd. \"Just two more wins.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
