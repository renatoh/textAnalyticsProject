The European Union's executive commission in Brussels called the first day of the switch a success, saying all incoming reports were positive. Many people lined up after midnight for euros just to have a look at the crisp, pastel-coloured bills with shiny foil holograms, which generated excitement throughout the day. \"When people get their change, they always look for a minute and many are saying it's their first euro,\" said Marina Wachsmuth, running the Arco coffee shop at Berlin's Zoologischer Garten station. \"Nobody's really had problems - they're just interested in the new currency.\" Pope John Paul II saluted the euro's arrival at a New Year's Day mass, addressing \"a special wish for peace and prosperity to the nations of the European Union that, today with the single currency, accomplish a historical goal.\" To get euros into people's wallets quickly, European officials are using a two-part strategy intended to vacuum most local currencies from circulation within two weeks: have most automated teller machines dispense euros in the first days of the new year; and have traders give change only in euros. Automated teller machines in Frankfurt, home of the European Central Bank, began churning out euros as the cash became legal tender at the stroke of midnight. Dresdner Bank spokesman Theis Kiewit said only 20 to 30 of its more than 1,100 machines had failed to work within a half-hour. \"We're very, very happy,\" he said. Rival Deutsche Bank said 98.5% of its 1,700 machines were ready at midnight, and spokesman Klaus Winker said more than 10,000 transactions were recorded in the first half-hour. European Central Bank officials had been in telephone contact with national central banks, which reported that \"things are going very smoothly,\" said bank spokesman Manfred Koerber. He said that the ECB estimated that between 80% and 85% of teller machines Europe-wide would be converted by midnight tonight. Euros flowed into people's hands more slowly in some places. In Brussels, where automated teller machines typically shut down after midnight, only a few people immediately got euros, and many machines around the Champs-Elysees in Paris did not immediately have euros. Ireland joined in around dawn, with more than 4,000 machines across the country expected to be converted by evening. Travellers stocking up on cash at a Dublin Airport ATM were the first to get the new bills. \"Our pound was always insignificant, irrelevant, unrecognised in the world,\" said Gerry Duggan, 49, holding up his euro notes with their silhouette maps of Europe, before catching his flight for a shopping break in Paris. \"This right here puts us on the map.\" Even in Switzerland, which is not a European Union member but is surrounded by countries that have joined the euro, the national rail company said several hundred people lined up at exchange offices in Zurich and Basel after midnight to get a first taste of the new money. Still, few people had started paying with euros in the 12 member nations by this afternoon. \"Many people have just been leaving from parties,\" said Berlin taxi driver Karin Glaubitz, whose meter now displays the fare in both currencies. \"They're having more problems than thinking about the euro.\" Ms Glaubitz said she and her partner were still giving change in marks, but they planned to switch to euros once more are in circulation. Old currencies will be legal tender for up to two months, depending on the country, and can be exchanged at central banks for years. But despite an 80m-euro public education campaign, some of the 303m people in the eurozone countries were slow to get the message. Many Greek taxi drivers said they would not change their meters until March, when the euro is the only valid currency, because they did not want to pay the extra cost for a meter that reads in both drachmas and euros. Staff at a Paris bakery said only three customers had paid for their morning croissants and baguettes with euros by 9am today. \"I want to see some euros - I haven't seen them yet,\" said Evelyne Patou, handing over a 200-franc bill (\u00a318.50) for her baguette. \"They're pretty,\" she said, holding up to the light the euro bills she was given as change. The euro was actually introduced in 1999, when national currencies were pegged to it at fixed rates and ceased to trade independently. That made them in essence local versions of the euro. But for many people, the psychologically important moment is when they can spend a cash euro. A potential hitch looms in France, where unions representing bank workers have threatened to strike tomorrow in an effort to force employers to discuss salaries, hiring and security. European officials hope using one common currency will spur economic growth by eliminating the risks of cross-border currency ups and downs, and bring Europeans closer together politically. The nations adopting the euro are: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Those staying out are Britain, Sweden and Denmark. Also changing over are the Vatican and San Marino, which have long used the Italian lira; the tiny states of Monaco and Andorra, the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, which until now used the German mark, and the province of Kosovo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
