Now aged 53, he is the second most wanted man in the world and is believed by international intelligence agencies to be the \"operational brains\" behind the September 11 2001 attack on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon. Zawahri was raised in the affluent, cosmopolitan suburb of Maadi, about six miles south of Cairo, where he is likely to have come into contact with many foreigners and non-Muslims. He was studious at school and looked set to follow in the footsteps of the many relatives who had distinguished themselves throughout the Middle East and beyond as medics and scientists. According to an in-depth profile in the Star, a Jordanian political weekly, \"under ordinary circumstances Ayman al-Zawahri should have figured as yet another doctor in the infinite list of successful medics that characterises his father's extended family\". But the introspective Zawahri, whose childhood home was \"on the wrong side of Maadi's tracks\", may have felt \"out of place\" in this prosperous pseudo-western enclave. Indeed, as the Star article suggests, his encounters with non-Egyptians - often far wealthier than the natives who served in shops and the lower echelons of local government - may have proved \"counter productive, especially for a boy from a more traditional family and known to be somewhat of an introvert\". Other reports suggest it was political events in the Middle East - particularly the six-day war fought between Israel and its Arab neighbours in 1967 - that turned him into a militant. Whatever the reasons for his disaffection, he created his first \"terror cell\" in his high school according to Lawrence Wright, who wrote a landmark biography of Zawahri for the New Yorker. This turned out to be more than mere schoolboy fantasy because, within a few years, Zawahri had established Egyptian Islamic Jihad, whose stated aim was the violent overthrow of the secular Egyptian government and its replacement with an Islamic theocracy. He was arrested and served three years in prison, where he was questioned under torture in connection with the assassination of Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat. After his release, he travelled to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, finally moving to Afghanistan, where he became Osama bin Laden's personal physician and a key aide. While Bin Laden is seen as the al-Qaida figurehead, however, Zawahri has always played a crucial role. He is suspected of helping organise the 1997 massacre of 67 foreign tourists at Luxor and was indicted by the US in connection with the 1998 bombings of two US embassies in Africa. He is also suspected of involvement in a series of assassinations and bombings against Egyptian targets and has been sentenced to death in absentia by an Egyptian court. Last September, Zawahri appeared in a video released on Arab television which showed the bearded, turbaned cleric climbing down a craggy mountain alongside Bin Laden. The two men are \"mutually dependant\", according to Lawrence Wright, who summed up their relationship - and the merger of al-Qaida and Islamic Jihad - in the following terms: \"Neither would do well without the other. Zawahri is cunning and experienced; he knows how to run underground cells, from his clandestine experience in Egypt. \"But he's not Bin Laden - he's not charismatic and he's not a natural leader. People don't want to give up their lives for Zawahri in the same way they want to for Bin Laden. Moreover, Bin Laden had money; Zawahri and his organisation were constantly strapped. And so they became dependent on Bin Laden.\" The US$25m (\u00a313.7m) bounty on Zawahri's head - equal to that offered for information leading to the capture of Osama bin Laden - shows just how far he has developed his deadly organisational skills and natural cunning since the days of his schoolboy plotting. It also reflects his significance as a target in the war on terror - and explains why, if Pakistani forces really have him cornered, they will pour all available resources into securing his capture."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
