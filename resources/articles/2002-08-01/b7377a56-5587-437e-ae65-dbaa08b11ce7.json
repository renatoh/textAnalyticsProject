The 28-year-old Nigerian international defender, who had a spell at Derby County two seasons ago, has been unattached since his contract with the German club Kaiserslautern was cancelled in April. City are looking for defensive reinforcements, having been resoundingly beaten by Leeds on the opening day of the season, and could see the former Milan and Internazionale player, who has 40 Nigerian caps, as an inexpensive solution. \"Taribo is not here on trial,\" City's manager Kevin Keegan said. \"We know what he is about and there is no doubting his ability. I am interested in looking at his fitness.\" Alpay Ozalan has revealed that he is determined to leave Aston Villa even if they decide to offer him a massively improved contract, because of the way they publicised his pay demands. \"There is no way that Villa could make me happy,\" the 29-year-old Turkish international defender said. \"This is because they promised me they would keep all negotiations in-house and they have broken that promise. \"I didn't ask for a 50% increase and even if they doubled my money I'd still want to leave. A week ago, Villa could have made me happy but the trust between us has now been broken. It is finished.\" Blackburn's Damien Duff will sign a two-year extension to his contract on his return from international duty later this week, finally putting an end to rumours of an imminent move to Manchester United or Liverpool. But the 23-year-old, whose wages will increase to \u00a330,000 a week, has insisted on a get-out clause that will allow him to talk to any club that makes an offer of \u00a315m or more after the end of this season. \"I'm definitely going to stay on,\" said the Republic of Ireland international. \"I haven't prolonged the negotiations or anything. When it's ready to sign, I'll sign it.\" The Sunderland manager Peter Reid will complete the \u00a33m signing of Leicester's promising forward Matthew Piper this week after seeing off a rival bid from Southampton. Tore Andre Flo, the player he seeks to fill the No9 shirt, could arrive from Rangers. Southampton yesterday gave up on Piper after Sunderland increased their offer. \"It appears he has now decided to go to Sunderland after turning them down,\" said the Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe. \"We will leave the door open because you never know in football, but it looks as though that is the end of the matter.\" Flo, meanwhile, has asked his agent to be ready for action if Sunderland make a formal \u00a35m offer. \"He has asked me to be ready to step in if the clubs close a deal,\" said Gunnar-Martin Kjenner. \"Tore Andre loves the Premiership.\" Jason Koumas will finally move to West Bromwich Albion this week after the club made an improved \u00a32m offer to Tranmere, having had a \u00a31.5m bid turned down last week. The Italian league authorities will decide today whether to postpone the start of the Serie A season to allow clubs to agree television deals. Eight of the clubs, who negotiate with broadcasters separately, have yet to conclude deals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
