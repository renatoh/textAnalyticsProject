For Twenty20 the coaching manual has been torn asunder and a new one drawn up for the modern age that would have had The Don blanching. Anything goes, however idiosyncratic, (indeed the more idiosyncratic the better at times) as long as it produces runs. The field is now a genuine 360-degree opportunity. Yet, Eoin Morgan's switch-reverse-paddle aside (an orthodox sweep had he stayed where he was) there is little new. The Pakistani Mushtaq Mohammad was reverse-sweeping in the 60s, Martin Crowe switch-hitting in the Lord's nets when on the groundstaff there almost 30 years ago. Fifteen years before that, and pre-helmets, a personal schoolfriend was playing a shot that involved squaring up to the bowler and flipping a length ball directly over his head and the keeper. He became a senior police officer. Meanwhile, the Joe Gargerys on village greens have been clogging the ball over cow corner since time immemorial. It is the batsman's job to mess up the bowling, and manoeuvre the field around. No longer are deliveries played on merit, but shots are predetermined. Bat speed is the modern mantra, wristiness a virtue. It becomes a mind game of bluff and double bluff with the bowler and opposing captain. The batsman will move laterally in the crease and down the pitch. Some, such as Brendon McCullum or Kevin Pietersen will play the angles by advancing on off-stump, obscuring the stumps, and plundering midwicket. This week, Ramnaresh Sarwan countered England's tactic of bowling full and wide of off-stump from round the wicket, by stepping inside and chopping to third man. No one, fast or slow, is immune to the ramp, the outrageous flip over the shoulder played from a kneeling position. Then there is Chris Gayle. Bowling As with batting, orthodoxy is something best left to the Greek church. There is little place now for \"length and line\" or those who put the ball \"there or thereabouts\". Length is hittable. In the recent Indian Premier League, a pacy Australian turned Dutchman, Dirk Nannes, kept out Glenn McGrath, the most metronomic bowler of the age. The bowler has to anticipate, looking for clues as a boxer might watch his opponent's eyes. A complete attack contains pace, swing with the new ball, reverse swing later, those who can \"take the pace off the ball\" with the use of different grips and wrist actions, and spin, which far from providing an opportunity to pebble-dash the upper terraces, is a mainstream form of attack. Daniel Vettori, a left arm spinner, is rated as one of the leading one-day bowlers in the world. Aside from movement, a seam bowler needs three essential lengths: a default length as a starting point; a yorker, the better to get the ball through the arc of the batsman's swing and still the best counter to hitting; and a bouncer, which has to be directed at the eyes, from which height it is hard to control a shot. Around these essentials come the variations. Heavily disguised slower balls \u2013 none of which has been bettered than that used by the West Indian Franklyn Stephenson 20 years ago \u2013 come in a variety of forms: a straightforward off-spinner or cutter; another bowled with a split grip where the first two fingers are splayed; yet another sent out between first finger and thumb, the hand turned sideways on delivery; another again bowled out of the back of the hand, as a leg-spinner. All are intended to disrupt the rhythm of the stroke. Use of the creases are important, so that angles can be varied. England's tactic from round the wicket, employed in the warm-up against West Indies, is an attempt to bowl wide to a field set accordingly without the unfair restriction placed on them by umpires. Such is the freedom of movement of batsmen now, that the wide rule may have to be revised. Fielding The overall standard of fielding in one-day cricket was already high, a galaxy away from previous generations. There is no hiding place. Fielders are fit, athletic, and ubiquitous. Positions that once were outposts now become mainstream and vital. Paul Collingwood's move from backward point \u2013 which has become pivotal in 50 overs cricket and in which he is among the worlds most adept \u2013 to extra cover shows how the shot range has altered. Slips play only a minor role, while deep midwicket and deep square-leg are crucial, often the first scouts to go out rather than the normal long on or long off. The nature of the wide rule means that it is difficult to set loaded fields, with a bias towards one side or the other, something that the England tactic tried to address. The bowler has to try to force the batsman to play into a particular area with a field set accordingly. The team that hits the stumps most often could be the one that triumphs in the end, such are the small margins in such a short game. Outfielders are encouraged to hunt in pairs, the flick-back on the boundary to a team-mate for return shown to be quicker than collect and throw. Similarly the slide and throw, and the roll over and back onto the feet, all designed to cut milliseconds off the fielding process: most run outs are tight to the line. Watch the best infielders get close on either side of the wicket to cut down the angle, relying on reaction. In England's case, wicketkeeping has gone full circle, with the abandonment of a stopper who bats \u2013 Matt Prior the latest encumbent \u2013 to be replaced by a quality gloveman in James Foster. Much of his time will be spent stood up to the stumps to spin and medium to fast-medium alike, the better to cramp the batsman. Twenty20 probably produces more stumpings than other forms of the game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
