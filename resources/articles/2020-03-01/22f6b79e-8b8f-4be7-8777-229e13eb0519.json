The announcement came as the NHS launched an appeal to 65,000 retired doctors and nurses to come back to help with the coronavirus epidemic, under the slogan evocative of wartime: \u201cYour NHS needs you.\u201d The beds occupied by elderly and vulnerable people who have recovered from illness but need care in the community are now urgently needed for the expected influx of severely ill coronavirus patients. Getting them home with support or into a care home will enable the NHS to free up 15,000 beds and convert them to critical care. A further 15,000 beds will become available through cancelled elective operations, and 10,000 will be bought from the private sector. Local authorities will get \u00a31.6bn to boost the social care workforce. The rest of the money \u2013 \u00a31.3bn \u2013 will go to \u201cenhance the NHS discharge process\u201d, speeding up the assessments and decision-making at the hospital end. \u201cOur NHS and social care colleagues are at the heart of protecting the most vulnerable during the coronavirus outbreak, and the whole country is tremendously grateful for their commitment during this challenging time,\u201d said the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock. \u201cThis funding will help the NHS and social care services in our communities to rise to this once-in-a-generation challenge by allowing the NHS to do what it needs to, and help move people out of hospital as soon as possible to get them back home with the right support.\u201d The Local Government Association welcomed the financial boost. \u201cA widespread coronavirus epidemic across the country will have a huge impact on an already stretched adult social care system,\u201d said Ian Hudspeth, chairman of the LGA\u2019s Community Wellbeing Board. \u201cTo maximise the impact of this funding, councils will need to be able to target it towards the pressures in their particular local area, including support to the care provider market.\u201d Meanwhile 15,500 doctors and 50,000 nurses who have retired in the last three years are being asked to come back to fill a range of clinical and non-clinical roles, along with final year medical students and student nurses. \u201cAs the health service gears up to deal with the greatest global health threat in its history, my message to former colleagues is \u2018Your NHS needs you\u2019,\u201d said England\u2019s chief nursing officer, Ruth May. \u201cOur wonderful nurses in every corner of the country are preparing to change the way we work so that we can provide the right care for the rising numbers of people who will need it. \u201cBut we can\u2019t do it alone, so I am urging all recent former nurses to lend us your expertise and experience during this pandemic, because I have no doubt that you can help to save lives.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
