It's completely bike-o-phobic,' says Boris Johnson MP, upon hearing that bikes are now banned on some train services into London. One solution could soon see Boris trading in his Marin mountain bike, on which he's often spotted around Westminster, for a fold-up version. 'I might get one like that - I'm fed up with my bike being stolen,' he says. 'I've lost six or seven bikes to thieves, so I see the advantages. There's no mainline station in the UK where you can lock up a bike safely. So these are good investments.' Then there's the fact that a woman on a folding bike overtook him the other day on the streets of Islington. 'I don't understand the law of physics that states that you can go as fast on a bike with tiny wheels as one with large wheels,' he says. The only downside, says Boris, is that watching a bike being folded resembles 'one of those terrible pictures of people putting their heads between their legs.' Boris, currently higher education spokesman in David Cameron's shadow cabinet, promises great things for cyclists under a Tory government. 'It's going to be an Augustan era for cyclists under Cameron. There's going to be a glorious reconciliation between cyclists and motorists.' The Dream of Rome by Boris Johnson (HarperCollins, \u00a318.99) is out now. Interview by Ben Flanagan They say... 1.Birdy Red - Condor Cycles, \u00a3830 Everything a cyclist could want: an aluminium frame, full suspension, beefy V-brakes and 8-speed Shimano gears. First manufactured in 1995 by Riese und M\u00fcller, the wheels fold inwards, eliminating the need for a joint in the main frame. It weighs approximately 10.5kg, and folds down in about 15 seconds to 79 x 61 x 36 cm. Boris says... It's pretty good and incredibly light - how do they do it? It's extraordinary, but you wouldn't want to do very long distances on it. It's German? Can we get a British one? I'm going to downgrade it because it's a Kraut-wagon...only joking... They say... 2. Dahon Hon Solo - Condor Cycles, \u00a3699.99 An expression of passion: a single-speed bike with elegant cream-coloured frame. Its lace wood fenders and chain-guard are hand-crafted in an Oregon workshop. Components by Brooks (who make the leather saddle) and Sugino (who make crank set) will bring smiles to the faces of many a bicycle connoisseur. Weighs in at 9.9kg, and folds in 15 seconds to 75 x 67 x 29 cm. Boris says... For elderly rowing coaches going up the towpath, bellowing into their megaphones. I do like the leopard-skin finish though. It's a Roman imperial bike - it's got wooden mudguards! I see it's a prototype model...when perfected, it's going to be ideal at Henley. They say... 3. Brompton M3L - Condor Cycles, \u00a3480 'Brompton is the best make. There's nothing quite as quick and easy to fold up,' says one bike shop expert. Produced in a small west London factory since 1988, the Brompton has become a benchmark of good design. This entry-level model has three gears, folding pedals, and a neat pump. Optional extras include dynamo lights (\u00a352), carrying bag (\u00a395) and cloth pannier set (\u00a370). It folds in 15 seconds to 56.5 x 54.5 x 27 cm and weighs 11.5kg. Boris says... Wheely fantastic! Imagine being the Professor Brainstorm that dreamt that up. It's amazing! [Upon being folded] you could drag it as a piece of luggage - it's got wheels within wheels. It's quite light and is a beautiful piece of engineering. They say... 4. Specialized Globe Micro 2005 - Cycle Surgery, \u00a3369 (RRP \u00a3500) End-of-line clearance stock means this bike is a bargain at just \u00a3369 - but you'll have to be quick. The lightweight alloy frame has a patented folding system allowing you to fold and unfold the bike with the flip of a single lever. Features include a magnetic latch system, eight gears and folding pedals. The price also includes mudguards, a carry bag and rear rack. Boris says... It's fantastic the way it collapses. It was pretty comfortable and sturdy. A triumph of design. I wouldn't be surprised if some higher education establishment didn't have something to do with this. 5. Apollo Folding Bike - Halfords, \u00a399.99 The best-value folding bike on the market. It's an affordable option for commuters, caravaners, and those who need a small bike for space reasons. But the steel frame, rather than aluminium, means it is not that light to carry. There are no gears, but it does come with a bell and reflectors. Weighs approximately 17.5kg, and folds to dimensions of 85 x 59 x 36cm. Boris says... It's quite heavy but it does the job. It's a bit of a children's bike: there are no gears, and it's very basic. It's like a My Little Princess bike - it should be bright pink with sky blue wheels. It's good value though. Personal shopper cycle surgery's top tips Ask yourself: will you enjoy cycling on a fold-up bike? More expensive models can feel like proper bikes. But some cheaper models are barely functional - they have a wheel on each end, but that's about it. Lightweight models, some made from components such as titanium, can be worth the extra cost if you'll be riding or carrying your bike a long way. Folding pedals sound a bit gimmicky. But they're a 'must have' - regular pedals will jab you in the leg when you carry the bike. Some bikes come with built-in dynamos. But if you're fitting your own battery lights, be aware that they may snag when you try to fold the bike. Remove them if you leave the bike anywhere. If you are tall, make sure the seat can be raised high enough. If you're too low in the saddle, you risk damaging your knees. Hills and headwinds make gears a must, especially if you're cycling further than a mile or so. Some bikes are single speed. Internal hub gears are a consideration - they mean there are no greasy cogs that could trash your expensive new suit. They also require less maintenance. Buy a cover: London Underground and some train companies won't let you take a bike on certain services, so cover it up. A bicycle isn't a bicycle if they can't see the wheels. You'll need a hard case for stowing it on a plane. Puncture-resistant tyres are available as standard with some models - and are worth paying that little bit extra for. It's not uncommon for people to do 5-10 miles to the station in the morning - and I don't see why they couldn't go further on a decent folding bike.
