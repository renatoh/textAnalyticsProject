The consumer electronics and entertainment giant reported a second-quarter loss of 7.3bn yen (\u00a337m), down from a 23.3bn yen profit a year ago. The disappointing performance increases the pressure on Sir Howard Stringer, who was born in Wales and is Sony's first foreign chief executive. His appointment in April was part of a management shake-up aimed at re-establishing Sony as a market leader. He is expected to unveil a business strategy in September that could include axing several failing businesses. But, overseeing his first results announcement, he was obliged to lower expectations of full-year net income down to 10bn yen from the 80bn yen anticipated in April. It is the first time in four years that Sony, facing an onslaught of cheap, high-quality products from rivals at home and abroad, has recorded losses in two consecutive quarters. Sony's operating loss was 15.3bn yen, compared with a profit of 9.8bn yen last year. Group sales were down 3.3% to 1.56 trillion yen. The losses were also attributed to restructuring costs amounting to almost 16bn yen, almost all of which was spent on reviving the firm's struggling electronics division. Yet sales in the sector, which Sony once dominated, continued to fall during the quarter, by 1.4% to 1.1trillion yen. The faltering performance has exposed Sony's struggle to make an impact in the rapidly growing market in flat-screen televisions and other consumer goods, faced by competition from Asian rivals such as South Korea's Samsung. \"Price falls for liquid-crystal display TVs in Europe were much sharper than we expected,\" Sony's corporate executive officer, Nobuyuki Oneda, told reporters in Tokyo. \"The LCD TV market has expanded two or three times but we were not able to keep up.\" Once the market leader in portable music players with its Walkman range, Sony's range of digital music players has also failed to mount a significant challenge to Apple's iPod. Yesterday's results came as little surprise to investors, who were not expecting a miraculous recovery just two years after the infamous \"Sony shock\", when massive quarterly losses sent the firm's shares tumbling. \"Sony's numbers are bad, there is no question about it,\" Ken Masuda, a senior dealer at Shinko Securities, told Reuters. \"The stock will probably fall on this. But the market was expecting a weak result. I don't think we are looking at another Sony shock.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
