The 20-year-old, who has been on City\u2019s radar since 2013, is understood to be keen to move to the Premier League despite his father stating on Monday that the forward could still move to Bayern Munich or Real Madrid. However, after Carlo Ancelotti admitted on Tuesday that Bayern are no longer interested in signing him, Pep Guardiola will be encouraged to hear Christian Heidel\u2019s admission that San\u00e9 is set to leave the Bundesliga side. \u201cLeroy has made it clear he would like to leave this summer,\u201d he told Sky Sports. \u201cWe will consent to a transfer if Schalke\u2019s conditions are met.\u201d Initially City were willing to offer only around \u00a335m for the player who made his debut for Schalke in April 2014 and has 11 goals and seven assists in 47 Bundesliga games for the club. But with Schalke holding out for their asking price of \u20ac50m (\u00a342m), it is believed City will submit an improved offer. The son of the former Senegal striker Souleyman and former German rhythmic gymnast champion Regina Weber, San\u00e9 was included in Germany\u2019s Euro 2016 squad but played only 11 minutes, against France in the semi-final, which Germany lost 2-0. Earlier on Tuesday Ancelotti denied reports that Bayern were looking to sign him. \u201cThe team is very good. All positions are well staffed and we do not need new players for this season,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have very good young players here. You have to give them the opportunity to show it and to gain experience.\u201d City have already agreed a \u00a34m fee to sign the Argentinian goalkeeper Ger\u00f3nimo Rulli, with the 24-year-old set to join Real Sociedad on a season-long loan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
