After approval was granted today by the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, the BBC is to press ahead with plans to spend \u00a3150m over five years developing online educational products for schools, which it will give away free. Conservative shadow culture secretary John Whittingdale joined education publishers in hitting out at the decision, saying that it makes the case for the BBC coming under new super-regulator Ofcom even more urgent. \"This is just another example of the BBC using money raised by the licence fee to offer services that potentially compete with the commercial sector. There needs to be strong safeguards which the existing regulatory regime simply does not provide,\" said Mr Whittingdale. Ms Jowell said the decision came with \"the most stringent conditions\" attached but commercial rivals dismissed the requirements, which include a regulatory review after two years and the requirement that 50% of the curriculum must be produced by the commercial sector. \"The BBC doesn't have a great track record in keeping to conditions. In two years' time it might already be too late,\" said Phil Hemmings, director of investor relations at RM, one of the largest suppliers of educational software to schools and one of the BBC's most vocal critics. \"It would be unimaginable if the BBC were to suddenly decide to start publishing text books and giving them away free to schools, decimating the publishing industry. This is exactly the same thing but they can get away with it because it's a nascent industry.\" Smaller companies, which stand to lose out most, are also furious. \"I'm not at all happy. I think it's a shambles. It's one of the most ill-conceived educational schemes for a long time and could do a lot of damage,\" said Ian Goodall, the managing director of Big Bus, which produces software for primary schools. RM will continue with its judicial review against the BBC, which is due to be heard at the end of this month. However, the case may now be broadened to include the digital curriculum decision. \"We have a judicial review in place about the BBC acting outside its powers and we're as confident as you can be before a court case. Our lawyers advise us that there is scope to broaden that review to look at the decision as a whole,\" said Mr Hemmings. Other companies, which could include Financial Times publisher Pearson and ITV giant Granada, are expected to examine the possibility of legal action or a complaint to Brussels that the BBC was acting anti-competitively. \"People I've spoken to are disappointed and very cross. It wouldn't surprise me if you saw other companies coming to the same conclusion as us - which is the only way to beat this is to fight it with as much vigour as possible,\" added Mr Hemmings. Next week, the Tories plan to table an amendment to the communications bill calling on Ms Jowell to place responsibility for approving and monitoring such services with Ofcom rather than the government and BBC governors. \"It is indefensible that the government is unwilling to give this responsibility to its new communications regulator and is refusing to allow any independent adjudication of complaints about the BBC's activities,\" said Mr Whittingdale. Education minister Charles Clarke said today he was confident the BBC was keen to work with the commercial sector to grow the market as a whole but accepted the concerns of the industry. \"That's why I explicitly discussed these issues with the BBC. If you've had years of bitterness you have to take a position to move things forward. A pre-condition for moving forward is to accept the boundaries developed with Tessa Jowell. I don't think legal action will help the situation,\" he added. Colin Hughes, the managing director of Learnthings Ltd, a content provider controlled by Guardian Newspapers Limited that supplies coursework to school students, said he didn't think the BBC would pose a threat to his business. However, he said the conditions imposed on the BBC should have stricter. \"We feel that the conditions cited by Tessa Jowell should have been more stringent, in particular a greater requirement to collaborate with existing content providers whose work is compatible with the BBC,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
