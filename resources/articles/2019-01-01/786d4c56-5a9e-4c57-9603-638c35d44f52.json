To many, it was the defining moment of the 20th century. Perhaps, even, of all centuries. Humankind walked on the moon, in a scarcely imaginable feat of ingenuity and daring. That Neil Armstrong was the first man to do it is not a \u2018surprise twist\u2019. Half a billion people, roughly one-fifth of the world\u2019s population at the time, watched it happen live on their TV sets or listened to it on their radios. The man and the act have since become synonymous. To hear Armstrong\u2019s name is to immediately recall a series of timeless images: a footprint in dust, the planting of the American flag and two grown men skipping about with childlike abandon as the Earth watches on in silence. It is a story as beloved as it is familiar, which presents a fascinating problem to filmmakers. How do you breathe new life into one of the best-known stories of all time? For the team behind the astounding biopic First Man, the solution was simple: you tell the untold tales. It is within this space that writer Josh Singer (Spotlight) and director Damien Chazelle (La La Land) set their story, spanning the eight physically and emotionally gruelling years of Armstrong\u2019s life before that iconic \u2018small step\u2019, explaining not what he did as an astronaut, but rather how he came to be one at all. The result is a moon landing story like no other; an intimate character portrait rather than a history lesson and a small-scale study in grief and resilience set against, quite literally, a story of astronomical proportions. The unseen \u201cMy goal with this movie was to share with audiences the unseen, unknown aspects of America\u2019s mission to the moon,\u201d Chazelle says, \u201cparticularly Neil Armstrong\u2019s personal saga and what he may have been thinking and feeling during those famous few hours.\u201d As a shining example, then, of the biopic done right, First Man is a film masterfully defined by what it\u2019s not. It eschews the familiar machismo and tension of NASA control room scenes for dimly lit kitchens and moonlit walks, as well as relegating the most famous of all moments \u2013 the lunar landing itself \u2013 to a mere 10 or so minutes at the film\u2019s conclusion. The audience doesn\u2019t feel short-changed. The overwhelming sensation in that moment is one of empathy: a deep appreciation of the man behind the mission and the heart-wrenching struggles he overcame to be there. They are struggles that very few people knew about until now. \u201cIt is a story about an ordinary man who makes profound sacrifices and suffers through intense loss in order to achieve the impossible,\u201d Armstrong\u2019s sons, Mark and Rick, say in a statement attesting to the accuracy of the film\u2019s representation of their father. The loss they speak of concerns their sister Karen, who at just two years of age was diagnosed with brain cancer. After months of gruelling radiation treatment, Karen fell ill to pneumonia and died shortly after. Neil chose to endure the ensuing grief in private, never once bringing up the subject of Karen\u2019s illness or death with even his closest friends and colleagues. According to Armstrong\u2019s biographer, James Hansen, many of them never even knew he\u2019d had a daughter. That loss, and Neil\u2019s response to it, underscores Ryan Gosling\u2019s entire, remarkable performance in First Man. It\u2019s a deftly understated turn, conveying an introverted and emotionally repressed family man who used work and the emerging space program as the means of dealing with his loss (Karen died on 28 January 1962, and Neil was back in the air just nine days later). The nerdy engineer reports for duty \u201cIt\u2019s a very different movie and storyline than people expect,\u201d says Hansen, whose 2005 biography lends the film both its title and its astounding insights into the reluctant hero at its core. Nowhere is this more notable than in First Man\u2019s near-total absence of \u2018wonder\u2019. Films about space travel, both real and fictional, rarely venture far from themes of discovery, exploration and awe, yet in First Man that sense of wonderment is wholly replaced by duty. The task of reaching the moon is stripped of its JFK-driven aspiration and presented instead, matter-of-factly, as a problem needing to be solved. Several thousand problems, to be precise, each apparently more complex and frustrating than the last. This was a time of intense political turmoil, and in the unprecedented technological challenges of the space race, the Soviets were winning at every turn. This was, however, a dynamic in which Armstrong had no interest. To compound the already extreme pressures and anxieties of space travel with the additional burden of American heroism always sat uncomfortably with him. He preferred to see himself as just \u201can engineer and a pilot; a father and a friend\u201d, according to his sons. His own characterisation was even stronger: \u201cI am, and ever will be, a white-socks, pocket-protector, nerdy engineer.\u201d That aspect of Armstrong\u2019s character appealed to Singer and Chazelle as they settled on their story for First Man, and is reflected with awkward detail in his famously stilted and abrupt press conferences before the Apollo mission. His humility and introversion only deepened on his successful return to Earth, as he maintained that the entire experience made him feel \u201cvery, very small\u201d, and preferred, whenever possible, to redirect praise towards the thousands of engineers, physicists and mathematicians who helped make it all possible. The technical aspects of the mission and the related feats of those responsible are realised in First Man with astonishing (and, at times, uncomfortable) accuracy. The dark, cramped cockpits of both the Gemini and Apollo spacecraft are exact replicas of the ones that Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins occupied, and much of their dialogue is pulled directly from the official NASA radio transcripts. The result is an intensely claustrophobic film, aided by cutting-edge special effects and sound design that contribute to a remarkably visceral experience. From the terrifying opening scene involving Armstrong\u2019s near-fatal X-15 test flight in the Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere, to the final, tense moments of the lunar landing, much of the action is captured from Armstrong\u2019s point of view. Even as he stares into the infinity of space from the moon\u2019s surface during the film\u2019s touching finale, it remains an intimate scene rather than an epic one. Coupled with the focus on Armstrong\u2019s emotional, rather than physical, journey, the result is a movie about the man, shot in a way that makes you feel, frequently, like you are the man. It\u2019s at once an exhilarating and humbling experience, an opportunity to share in the moments \u2013 so personal, private and unknown \u2013 of one of history\u2019s most iconic figures. \u201cI wasn\u2019t chosen to be first,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cI was just chosen to command that flight. Circumstance put me in that particular role. That wasn\u2019t planned by anyone.\u201d Such was the case for so much of his extraordinary life. Circumstance, often in the form of profound personal tragedy, steered events and attempted to heap chaos upon a man whose life was governed by control. First Man is the honest, confronting and captivating account of that private contest; an intimate and revealing portrait of one man\u2019s resilience and his fierce determination to achieve the impossible. First Man is out on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray &amp; DVD from January 23rd. Out now on digital."}, "isHosted": false}}}
