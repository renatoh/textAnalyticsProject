This lump of craggy rock lies almost halfway between Africa and South America, surrounded by 55 million square miles of empty ocean. The maps of early explorers bore the words \"here be dragons\" in places like this. The only way to reach this British Dependent Territory is by sea, and we had just arrived after a five-day voyage from Cape Town on board the Royal Mail Ship St Helena. We had followed the same route as the square rigger of the Portuguese explorer J\u00e3o da Nova who stumbled upon this strategic toehold of land - measuring only 47 square miles - on the birthday of Saint Helena exactly 500 years ago. On board the RMS, we sailed in a style and comfort that da Nova could not have dreamt of - captain's cocktail parties, deck quoits, fancy-dress shindigs and multiple-course meals morning, noon and night. But the St Helena's days are probably numbered - it is the last Royal Mail ship in the world, and the islanders have voted in favour of a \u00a3102m, 10-year development project that will include an airport, a five-star hotel, golf course and luxury villas. Aboard the St Helena were about 40 tourists, mostly British with some South Africans. About 800 tourists visit the island every year, attracted by its history, but also by the natural beauty of one of the world's most remote landfalls, particularly the walks, birds, plant life, dolphins and fishing. The rest of the ship was packed with \"Saints\" going home for the quincentennial celebrations. You couldn't easily understand what they were saying when they spoke to each other, but when they slowed down you began to unravel their words into comprehensible English, softened by a country-and-western lilt and spiced with the remnants of exotic old accents. When at last the RMS dropped anchor, her horn blasted across James Bay and up Chapel Valley. Passengers were ferried to the wharf and family members ran to embrace each other. St Helena is a place of farewells and reunions, of banishment and punishment, of isolation. Over the past five centuries, a long line of exiles and unwilling passengers have been been ferried to this wharf below the volcanic rock-face of Jamestown: slaves from Africa, Zulu chief Dinizulu, Boer prisoners of war, Bahraini dissidents and, in 1815, the most famous of all, Napoleon. One morning, I joined Colin Corker's vintage Chevy charabanc tour to Longwood House, where Napoleon spent his last years. His presence infused the space like the permanent twilight contained by the shuttered windows. I could imagine his potent footfall around the billiard table. \"L'Empereur Napol\u00e9on I. Est mort ici le 5 Mai 1821.\" A brass plaque indicates the place where one of history's most powerful men succumbed at last to stomach cancer - shrunken, defeated, losing touch with reality, racked by pain. As I walked across the Longwood Green, I could also imagine the procession to the tomb in Geranium Valley led by his grey horse. \"I feel the infinite in myself\" - his words came alive under this silver Atlantic sky. The next day, I went fishing. It was typical St Helena weather. Shards of mist blew towards the land and swelled into a light drizzle. Then the sun broke through and a golden glow swept the coast like a searchlight, chased by grey shadows, until the sun grew fierce and burnt the shadows away. Ten minutes out of James Bay, we were surrounded by hundreds of dolphins. Our skipper, Michael Thorpe, steered the boat slowly in a large circle, and they played with us - leaping and twisting, poking their faces out of the water right next to the boat. Like children, we ran from side to side, laughing with salt spray on our faces and shouting every time a dolphin leapt high. We dropped two fishing lines in the water and headed for Dry Gut Bay. A tiny fishing boat rocked in the sea off Egg Island - a huge jagged rock streaked white by guano - then disappeared momentarily behind the swell that rose at its stern. The sudden \"krrrrrrrr\" of the fishing reel broke the morning murmur. \"Wahoo!\" shouted Fred, the local fisherman on our boat. The barracuda's silver form flashed through the water. After a long struggle, it lay on deck, 3ft of shimmering and shuddering fish. By the time we had caught two more tuna, the skipper pronounced the hunt over. I noticed Fred prayed before gutting the fish. Michael pointed out the fortifications that ribboned the high cliff faces of the island, once one of the most strategically important 47 square miles in the British Empire. A few days later, I walked from Jamestown around Rupert's Bay to Half Moon Battery and marvelled at the display of engineering genius that surely rivalled the best of the Romans. The lookouts, shelters and defences were perched on harsh crags, but the heavy weaponry lugged there by donkey was never used. Heavily fortified after a surprise attack by the Dutch in 1673, no shot has since been fired in anger at St Helena. The ruins of the battery have crumbled slowly, retreating back into the rugged rock. It was a hard life for some. In 1816, Richard Cross of the 53rd Regiment drew the outline of his hand on a rock at Gregory's Battery, added his age in two Roman numeral 10s and drew a wreath around it, then jumped off the cliff into Turks Cap Valley. Now, where hundreds of soldiers had once shouted and marched, a slow wind shook the prickly pear and silence bore down on the ruins. Back in Jamestown, the Georgian facades, castle, taverns, shops and streets have changed little since the days of the East India Company. I stayed in the comfortable Harris Guest House. Donald Harris is a baker, and every morning the cosy smell of bread rose to the upper corners of the house. Irene Harris is one of the best cooks on the island. Her three-course dinners at \u00a37 per head included deep-fried stuffed chicken and peppermint fridge tart. Two hotels, a handful of guesthouses and a sprinkling of self-catering flats are jolted into business when the RMS arrives with guests. Most offer full board, but lunch and dinner can also be enjoyed at Anne's Place - the only restaurant on the island. It serves traditional fish dishes and locally-grown coffee. I spent three weeks on the island and could easily have spent six. There were still walks unwalked, stories I wanted to know more about (like Iris from Halftree Hollow who wore her wedding dress for the rest of her life), and more hidden coves to be explored. When the RMS sailed into the bay again after returning from Ascension Island, I felt as if a friend had come to fetch me too early from a very good party. The next morning, we embarked and the RMS slipped her mooring in bright sunshine, hugging the coastline for an hour or two. When we passed Speary Island and sailed into the teeth of a wind ripping up a four-metre swell, she turned away into the vast Atlantic Ocean. Soon St Helena was no longer visible.
