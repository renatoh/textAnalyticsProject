The BBC's equivalent of Celebrity Love Island sees the likes of Marti Pellow and Sarah Brightman try to warble their way to victory with a non-singing celebrity in tow. Like watching Ian Thorp being chained to Bella Emberg and thrown in the North Sea, brother and sister/husband and wife Vernon Kay and Tess Daly oversee proceedings. In Hell, it plays on a loop. Grow Your Own Veg 8.30pm, BBC2 When civil society crumbles and all you have to live on are your wits and tins of tuna at the back of your cupboard, you'll be glad of Carol Klein and her guide to growing spuds. They may not count towards your five-a-day but the versatility and deliciousness of the potato knows no bounds. Chipped, roasted, mashed, baked - broccoli can only dream of such adaptability. After potatoes and Jerusalem artichokes, come beetroot and beans, carrots and cabbage, and, if you're so inclined, courgettes. Celebrity Big Brother 8.30pm, Channel 4 In the absence of any proper characters such as George Galloway and Pete Burns, the editors at Endemol have a challenge on their spidery, six-fingered hands. Jermaine might not like germs and Danielle may not like herself but, in themselves, such things don't make for great TV. With this in mind, tonight a whole family is being moved into the house to invigorate goings-on. Fingers crossed it's the Mansons. Timewatch: The Hunt for U864 9pm, BBC2 As volcanoes and dinosaurs are to science documentaries, so Nazis and Tudors are to history programming. Where Nazis are concerned, nothing beats vanished treasures or a bit of the occult to tweak interest further, but in the absence of those, underwateriness will do just as well. Timewatch returns with a story of submarines and a tense battle to the death in February 1945 between HMS Venturer and the altogether less-poetically monikered U864. (No prizes for guessing who won.) As an archaeological salvage team seek out the wizened German wreck, jobbing actors reconstruct the claustrophobia. Deep breaths all round."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
