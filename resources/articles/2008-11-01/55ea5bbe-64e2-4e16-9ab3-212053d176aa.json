In fact, the state was called between the time I left home and arrived at the Polish Falcon, on East 3rd Street in Erie, Pennsylvania, where Democratic candidate for the state Senate, Cindy Purvis, was hosting her election-day party. It was in a wide, white room with rows of tables spread evenly throughout. A buffet table with pizza and salad stood to one side. A television blared with CNN. The crowd was mostly older, working stiffs. A few wore \"Letter carriers for Obama\" shirts, featuring a hand clutching a letter emerging from the red-and-white striped field in the Obama logo. George Miller, the Erie Times-News reporter, hovered on the edge of the crowd in a long, dark trench coat and thick glasses. Purvis' supporters started out in a good mood - and why not? Not only had Obama won their state, but it had been a beautiful day, sunny and warm, temperatures in the low 70s. The city's ubiquitous maple trees were explosions of colour, and their litter lined the streets with gold. The mood in Erie was festive, as voters were out on the sidewalks heading to their polling places, calling out to one another across the streets: \"Did you vote?\" I went to the party thinking Pennsylvania's 49th Senate district race could tell me what kind of election I could expect. Purvis was a first-time candidate running a grassroots campaign to bring universal healthcare to the state. Her Republican rival, Jane Earll, was formidable: a multi-term incumbent, once a state-wide candidate for lieutenant governor, who had prevailed in three previous elections in this heavily Democratic district. But Earll was also hostile to unions and a supporter of a disastrous energy deregulation scheme. Was the 49th ready for change? Was the Erie electorate hungry for progressivism? Were Obama's coattails big enough to sweep up Purvis with him? The question surrounds Obama's strategy of bringing new voters into the fold. Voter registration was setting new records in the county. The question for Purvis, and other down-ticket candidates across the country, was: would these people vote the Democratic party line in the polling booth? At the Polish Falcon, the media outlets called Ohio for Obama. Election over, just like that. No one said anything, but the math was cruel to John McCain. New Mexico fell for Obama, as well. The local media broke in to say that the 49th Senate district was a race to watch in Erie county, along with the tussle for Pennsylvania's 3rd congressional district House seat between Democrat Kathy Dahlkemper and long-time Republican incumbent Phil English. Erie is the midnight blue swath in PA-03. Would English become a casualty of the Democratic wave? The results. With nearly half of the districts reporting, Purvis was down by nine points. Dahlkemper, however, still led English, by seven points. Obama had a massive lead in Erie. The crowd began to thin. Purvis mingled with her supporters, still upbeat. The crowd didn't know, but Purvis' hopes looked bleak. The initial districts reporting were in Erie proper; her staff had the numbers from the outlying, suburban regions of the county, and they were heavily skewed for Earll. When the election was officially called for Obama, ragged cheer went through the dozen or so remaining supporters. The pizza had long since disappeared, and the large cake with American flag was half-devoured and marred by ragged cuts. I saw someone who volunteered with me for the Obama campaign, a Vietnam veteran with a silver beard and Navy baseball cap. His eyes were filled with tears for Obama's victory. I don't know his name, but we embraced. Purvis' standing in the polls, by contrast, continued to drop. At the end of the night, she lost by 16 points, 58-42%. In the same precincts, Obama outpolled John McCain, 59-39%. Dahlkemper won 57% of the county's electorate compared to English's 43%. Obama went on to win all of Pennsylvania with 55% of the state's votes, and Dahlkemper won PA-03 with 52% of her district's votes. What did these results tell us about the election, and about Pennsylvania? For one, it's obvious that Obama voters didn't vote the party ticket. In Erie county, Obama outpolled Dahlkemper by about 4,000 votes, and Purvis by more than 29,000. Likewise Earll outpolled McCain, 61,000 to 48,800. And Purvis wasn't the only Democrat to lose Erie county: John Morganelli drew only 44% of Erie's votes in his attempt to unseat the state's Republican attorney-general, Tom Corbett. And lest you think Purvis' loss was a result of new voters who were wooed to the booth by Obama, but were ignorant about down-ticket races, Erie county voters were more likely to vote in the 49th state Senate district race in 2008 than they did in 2004, by about 4%. In fact, turnout in Erie county was lower in 2008 than it was for 2004, by about 2,000 voters - quite an anomaly in an election that had record turnout across the country. Who stayed home? Was the new voter and Obama supporter a myth in Erie? What's more likely is that conservative voters were discouraged and stayed home - after all, Obama finished much better in Erie than John Kerry did, by about 5%. What happened in Erie was that the demographics and makeup of the electorate was different than it was four years ago, enough to give Obama a clear victory and boost Dahlkemper, but not enough to bring Purvis into office. In the end, what lost the race for Purvis might be old-fashioned campaigning. Earll outspent her three-to-one and was able to buy television ads, something Purvis couldn't afford. Purvis' grassroots campaign style probably fared well in the city, but it's likely the small campaign couldn't reach the suburbs with much intensity - the districts that carried Earll to a big victory. Contrast that to Dahlkemper's campaign, which received a $1.5m boost from the DCCC, the House Democrats' election committee. Not only that, but English had a poor reputation as an ineffectual lawmaker - in contrast to Earll, who has successfully campaigned and governed from a heavily Democratic district. And when you look at the numbers, Purvis did finish considerably better than the last Democratic candidate to face Earll, in 2004. That year, the Democrat garnered about 35% of the vote. So, yes, Obama appears to have had some coattails, but only enough to give Purvis a few points' advantage. Those points, combined with the opportunity of a bad incumbent and a substantial financial boost, allowed Dahlkemper to win PA-03. But Purvis ran into a tougher opponent, with considerably less financial resources. In the end, Obama's message of bipartisan unity may have propelled him to the White House, but it probably gave voters permission to split their tickets. Whatever the case, Tuesday night it was a tired Cindy Purvis who rose to address the knot of supporters who had stayed until the end to give a concession speech, not Jane Earll. But the convention centre was filled with ecstatic Obama supporters, and the campaign headquarters was showing Obama's speech on a wide-screen television, and cars drove up and down State Street blowing their horns."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
