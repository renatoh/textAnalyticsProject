I\u2019m speaking to people one to one, effing and jeffing, getting the team going. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult when you\u2019re not involved, and I go in with the mindset that I\u2019ll probably take a bit of a back seat, just have a quiet word and then I end up like: \u2018Come on then lads!\u2019 It\u2019s just in me, it\u2019s how I\u2019ve always been and it probably won\u2019t change.\u201d Delph is speaking at St George\u2019s Park, as he prepares to travel to Portugal with England for the Nations League finals. He is an intelligent, entertaining man. Anyone who has seen the City documentary series All or Nothing will recognise the midfielder\u2019s description of himself. After City lost the Manchester derby in April 2018, we watch Delph in the dressing room, ripping into his team\u2019s performance and embarking on an industrial-strength tirade about \u201cthe basics of football\u201d. Eventually he is placated by his manager, but the point has been made, and forcefully. After earning his place in City\u2019s centurions as an impromptu left\u2011back, the following season proved trickier for Delph. A two\u2011month run in the side was brought to an end by a red card in the defeat by Leicester at Christmas. As City went on to complete a domestic treble, the 29-year-old made only five more appearances. The quality Delph could make best use of in that time, therefore, was his presence in the dressing room, his inability to stay quiet. And if he couldn\u2019t play, he wanted his teammates to kick on, including those he already considered to be among the best in the world, such as Raheem Sterling. \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing young man,\u201d says Delph of his City and England colleague, who looks set to earn his 50th cap against the Netherlands on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m older than him, I\u2019ve been around a lot longer even though he\u2019s probably played twice as many games. [I give him] regular pats on the back, motivating him, giving him good advice, telling him to be confident. \u201cPeople still forget that he\u2019s only 24 years old. When we both signed for City he was 19 [he was actually 20], he looked like a little baby. People questioned what type of player he\u2019d be and whether he would go to that next level. I remember speaking about it a few years back and I was like: \u2018This kid has everything \u2013 once he finds his path and finds what works for him, you\u2019re going to see something incredible.\u2019 \u201cI still believe he\u2019s operating at about 80%. So if he can push himself a bit more, which I know he will because his mindset is very good, I think the sky\u2019s the limit in the next couple of years.\u201d Delph says he has received similar encouragement from Sterling, especially when the pair have gone away with England. \u201cI remember when I played in November for the national team,\u201d Delph says, \u201che was doing that for me. He was the one who was pumping me up and telling me to express myself and to be more direct. I was like: \u2018Wow, OK.\u2019\u201d As he ponders where his club career goes next \u2013 minutes elsewhere v medals with City \u2013 England has proven a valuable outlet for Delph. He enjoyed a strong World Cup, despite largely being reduced to a substitute\u2019s role. This year he was named as captain by Gareth Southgate against the USA at Wembley. He is also part of the \u201cleadership group\u201d within the England squad. The respect Southgate shows Delph is mutually felt. The player is highly complimentary of his manager and the team around him. \u201cGareth has a great way about him, [as do] the staff that he\u2019s got,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re really good people and, when you come here, straight away you feel at home. So if they tell you to run through a brick wall, you\u2019re going to run through a brick wall. You\u2019re going to do everything that you can for these people. \u201cSince the World Cup we\u2019ve changed the system, we\u2019ve changed the way we\u2019re playing. What we do at City is pretty incredible but that\u2019s at City. When you come away from that it\u2019s a different ethos and everyone is buying into what Gareth is putting on the training pitch and in the meeting rooms. Everybody is heading in the same direction.\u201d After taking part in the FA Cup final, City\u2019s players were granted leave to arrive late to the camp at St George\u2019s Park. Typically, Delph ignored that dispensation and arrived at St George\u2019s Park a week earlier than he had to. He has also been playing 60 minutes of a practice match on top of training each day to prove his readiness. This mini-tournament in Portugal presents a real chance of silverware for the first time since Le Tournoi in 1997 and Delph\u2019s thoughts on the Nations League are typically straightforward. \u201cI really want to win this competition.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
