I enjoy nurturing genuine enthusiasm. You get some students who are so passionate about a subject, and you really want to support that. Sometimes you get students who think studying media is going to be about how they can be the next Cat Deeley. They end up on a course where there are debates and discussions about film censorship and how advertising works, and it's not what they thought it would be. But hopefully, most of them enjoy that journey. I'm a Londoner - I moved up here for the job - and one of the things that strikes me about Liverpool is that it's such a great place for media students. There's so much going on: they can go to a gallery or a public space and see all kinds of experimental film work, and film/video installations. There's a great cinema/gallery complex called Fact. And Manchester's not that far away. There's a real buzz about TV/film production in the north-west. I'm lucky because the college really encourages enrichment activities, such as the Africa at the Pictures festival last month, where I devised workshops with leading African film-makers. I spent 13 years in industry so I had experience in editing, advertising and working in audio-visual. Over the past six to seven years, I've started to lose contact with people and one thing that would improve my job would be the opportunity to shadow people in industry as a practical way of keeping in touch with what's going on.
