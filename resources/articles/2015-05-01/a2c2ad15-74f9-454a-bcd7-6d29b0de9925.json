S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, the environment minister and former presidential candidate, will play a leading role in the United Nations conference in December as the French government is working to produce a new \u201cParis protocol\u201d that would determine the future of global action on climate change for decades beyond 2020. She told the Guardian in an exclusive interview: \u201cDeveloping countries are not hostile [to an agreement]; I would say that they are positive, but they are waiting to see. We have to meet their expectations.\u201d She said that the key to a successful agreement would be for rich countries to come forward with plans to provide financial assistance to the poorer world, to help developing nations cut their greenhouse gas emissions, avoid basing their future economic growth on fossil fuels and adapt their infrastructure to the likely ravages of climate change. Royal strongly criticised commodity businesses that she said had \u201cseized resources\u201d without factoring in the cost of the climate change arising from the greenhouse gases they emit. \u201cThe financial sector has been extremely predatory on natural resources for a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cThey must understand what is at stake. Natural resources have been seized, and the real costs of them have not been paid. We did not give the right price.\u201d She said energy, transport and construction companies would all have to change radically the way they do business, in order to reduce emissions and lead the way to a low-carbon economy. At Paris in December, world governments are expected to sign a new global agreement on climate change, with commitments from both developed and major developing countries on limiting greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2020, when current commitments run out. This is seen as the last chance for the world to craft such an agreement, because scientists have warned that rising emissions will soon push the world over the critical 2degC threshold, beyond which global warming is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. So far, more than 30 countries, including the EU and the US, have submitted emissions plans to the UN. Developed countries are expected to make absolute cuts in their emissions, by 2025 or 2030, that go much deeper than the cuts to be made by 2020, which were agreed at the landmark Copenhagen climate conference in 2009. Poorer countries are required only to curb the future growth of their emissions. But analysis of the commitments made so far, and likely to made before Paris, show that they are insufficient to meet the targets scientists say are needed to avoid dangerous levels of climate change. Royal said she was pushing countries \u201cto be more ambitious, to come up with more\u201d ahead of the Paris conference. She said there was an urgent need to invest more in renewable energy, electric vehicles and energy efficiency, if climate change goals were to be met. As \u201can ideal\u201d, she said, the world would \u201cgive up fossil fuels\u201d. But \u201cI don\u2019t think we are going to\u201d in the short term at least, she added. She was also adamant that climate change was not merely a question of economics, but \u201ca matter of civilisation\u201d, and that people should be persuaded to see reducing emissions, and the means to do so, such as renewable energy, in a positive light. \u201cWe do not want environmental issues to be a matter of punishment,\u201d she said. \u2022 This article was corrected on 29 May 2015.
