Image: Shiv Kapila, December 2010 [velociraptorize]. Nikon D300s DSLR and Sigma 150-500mm f6.3 Question: This remarkable mystery bird has a special ability that makes it unique among birds. Can you name this ability? In view of the fact that this bird's family is obvious, I am happy to award smug points for anyone who correctly identifies the species. Response: This is an adult R\u00fcppell's griffon vulture, Gyps rueppellii. Gyps is a genus of Old World vultures in the bird family Accipitridae. This family also includes eagles, kites, buzzards and hawks. R\u00fcppell's griffon vultures are sight hunters. This species is very similar to the White-backed Vulture, Gyps bengalensis, but is distinguished by its yellowish bill. The R\u00fcppell's griffon vulture is special, even amongst birds, because it is considered to be the world's highest-flying bird, with confirmed evidence of a flight at an altitude of 11,000 metres (36,100 ft) above sea level. This was confirmed after the unfortunate bird had been sucked into an airplane engine whilst flying over Abidjan, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, at that altitude. This species has a variant of the hemoglobin alphaD subunit which has a high affinity for oxygen. This protein allows these remarkable birds to breathe efficiently despite the low partial pressure in the upper troposphere -- where humans would normally pass out.
