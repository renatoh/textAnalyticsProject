If you\u2019re downbeat about Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, know that 48% of the country are with you, and one of them might just be your soulmate. No, honestly ... there is a new dating app in development that aims to let you meet other Remain voters so that you don\u2019t have to go through the pain alone. The idea for \u201cRemainder\u201d started off as a joke between \u201ctwo ordinary voters\u201d on Friday afternoon, but after receiving a huge number of sign-ups since the website went live, the pair are trying to make the app a reality. Billing itself as the \u201cdating and social app for the 48%\u201d, Remainder is in the early-formation stage at the moment, but discussions with a dating app developer means a launch could be expected soon, the team behind it told the Guardian. The website asks: \u201cVoted to Remain, and looking for love? What better way to recover than hooking up with someone who shares your sense of existential dread?\u201d In a press release, the team behind Remainder explained: \u201cWe think everyone\u2019s entitled to their views and we know that there are many sensible, kind and intelligent leave voters but our audience is \u2018Remainers\u2019 and we\u2019re trying to provide a little comfort for these heartbroken voters. \u201cWe created it because all the remain voters we know seemed so depressed. Our Facebook feed had turned into a neverending funeral service. \u201cWe thought the best way of recovering must be to go out for a few drinks with someone who\u2019s in the same boat. After all \u2018a problem shared is a problem halved\u2019 and what we never managed to give Brussels was our British sense of humour.\u201d The target for sign-ups is over 16 million, the team said, and a crowdfunding site has at the time of writing received four backers. Early sign-ups and funders will be in line for invitations to exclusive events in remain-voting cities such as London, Brighton, Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow and Edinburgh. \u201cWe don\u2019t have heaps of cash to throw at it, so we\u2019re just dependent on the goodwill of friends, friends of friends, and fellow \u2018Remainers\u2019,\u201d the team added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
