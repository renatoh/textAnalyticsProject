At 6am on Sunday there were 96 bush and grass fires in NSW - 47 of which were not contained. Five fires are at a watch and act level. Conditions eased on Sunday morning, allowing firefighters a chance to do critical back-burning and containment work ahead of Tuesday, when the mercury is tipped to soar into the 40s in parts of the state. NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said overnight conditions had improved. \u201cWe\u2019ve got much more benign conditions, particularly a dominant easterly influence which will stretch pretty much right across most of our fire grounds,\u201d he told Seven News. \u201cWhich means hundreds - as a matter of fact more than 1600 - firefighters are around again today doing really important and critical back burning and containment-line consolidation to try and gain the upper hand before we see those conditions deteriorate into Tuesday.\u201d Already this fire season, six people have died and more than 1,000 homes have been lost across NSW and Queensland. The largest conflagration, the \u201cmega fire\u201d at Gospers Mountain near Sydney\u2019s north-western outskirts, was likely to burn for weeks until substantial rain falls, likely at the end of January or early February. The NSW Bureau of Meteorology said the largest fires simply could not be extinguished by water-bombing aircraft or firefighting crews on the ground. \u201cThe massive NSW fires are in some cases just too big to put out at the moment \u2026 they\u2019re pumping out vast amounts of smoke which is filling the air, turning the sky orange and even appearing like significant rain on our radars,\u201d the bureau said. The bureau has forecast a grim week ahead, with strong winds forecast for fire-affected areas and no rain relief in sight. A months-long drought in eastern Australia has left bushland tinder dry and prone to ignition, especially from dry lightning strikes. Temperatures are expected to reach 43C in western Sydney, and 44C in the Hunter region immediately north of Australia\u2019s largest city. Temperatures will also soar in the state\u2019s north-west, where they are forecast to hit 44C in Bourke and 43C in Colbar. In Queensland late on Saturday, a shipping container filled with fireworks exploded and residents were forced to flee their homes as an unpredictable fire threatened homes in Bundamba, on the outskirts of the state capital, Brisbane. Residents within an three-kilometre-squared exclusion zone were ordered out as the firefront was waterbombed but fire crews warned they might not be able to stop the fast-moving blaze. Conditions have eased off, a spokeswoman for Queensland\u2019s Fire and Emergency Services said on Sunday morning, however are expected to pick up later in the day. A high fire danger rating is in place for the Darling Downs and Granite Belt to Cape York Peninsula, and will ramp up to severe in the Northern Goldfields and Upper Flinders on Monday. One home was reportedly destroyed in the Bundamba fire on Saturday night. The chief scientist at the Australian Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Dr Bidda Jones, said that, beyond the human cost of the fires, the widespread blazes would have a \u201cmajor impact of biodiversity\u201d. \u201cDepending on the intensity of the fire, it will have had a massive impact on wildlife,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd not just on those iconic species like koalas. You have to think of this in terms of how it affects the entire ecosystem. \u201cYou have animals relying on the eucalyptus trees for their primary diet \u2013 greater gliders are another example of that. Then you have a whole range of other species living off nectar or the insects in that environment, and there\u2019s going to be a considerable loss of insect life in those fires.\u201d Jones said animals often preferred old large trees for nesting, the trees most likely to be destroyed by the fires. \u201cAnd then with fires that have been burning even at low intensity, leaf litter and all the understorey is gone. That\u2019s providing food and refuge to animals there and the animals they would eat. \u201cSo if you look at the overall picture \u2026 the damage has been so extensive, it\u2019s going to have a major impact on biodiversity.\u201d Much of Jones\u2019s own property, which backed on to national park at Braidwood near the Australian capital, Canberra, was lost to fires this week. \u201cAt this point almost all of that has been burnt, all of that continues forest, up to 31,000 hectares,\u201d she said. \u201cThe big trees are still there and we have greater gliders that live in the forest, as well as powerful owls. \u201cSo I\u2019m hoping that they\u2019ll be OK. They\u2019ll have lost nesting holes because the big trees have fallen and it\u2019s the big old trees that have the nesting holes.\u201d Jones\u2019s property was home to a huge variety of birds, as well as eastern grey kangaroos, swamp wallabies and red wallabies. \u201cWe were going out and meeting kangaroos and red neck wallabies that were moving away from the fire,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of wombats, I\u2019m not sure what they\u2019re going to eat. All of the forest floor, any grass any shrubs, are gone.\u201d Jones said her rainfall records showed last month to be the driest November in 40 years. The November average is about 100ml but this year it was 18ml. The role of climate change in contributing to Australia\u2019s unusually early and fierce fire season has been the subject of acute political debate. The federal government has refused to concede that climate change \u2013 and in particular Australia\u2019s continued rising carbon emissions and massive fossil fuel exports \u2013 have played any role in the current fire crisis. The Australian, prime minister Scott Morrison, has consistently said it was \u201cno credible scientific evidence\u201d linking climate change with the fires. This has been rejected by climate scientists, who have said politicians are \u201cburying their heads in the sand while the world is literally burning around them\u201d. \u201cAnytime I hear \u2018don\u2019t talk about climate change\u2019,\u201d Jones said, \u201canyone in my situation has absolutely no doubt these conditions are extreme and are connected to climate change.\u201d with Australian Associated Press"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
