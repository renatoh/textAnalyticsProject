Her music is", "bodyText": "When the carping over Madonna\u2019s age began in earnest, the focus wasn\u2019t on her singing, or songwriting, or even her stagecraft. The problem, according to certain sections of the press, lay with her hands. \u201cWhy do Madonna\u2019s hands look older than her face?\u201d asked the Daily Mail in 2006. Such was the paper\u2019s concern over the then 47-year-old\u2019s apparently awful paws, a plastic surgeon was drafted in to provide professional analysis. \u201cAs a person ages [the] plumpness goes, making the hand look bonier and more veiny \u2026 less elastic,\u201d he said sagely. Since then, close-ups of Madonna\u2019s hands have been as much a tabloid staple as Victoria Beckham\u2019s scowl or Amanda Holden\u2019s sideboob. Music critics tend not to pass comment on a musician\u2019s appearance \u2013 to do so would undermine the seriousness of their endeavour. But the assessments of Madonna\u2019s 14th album, Madame X, have nonetheless brought more subtle kind of disparagement. \u201cPerhaps the erstwhile Queen of Pop should be content with the role of Queen Mother of Pop now,\u201d said the Daily Telegraph\u2019s critic, going on to note that a woman who has shifted 350m units and broken every record for a female artist going hasn\u2019t had a Top 10 hit in a decade. Even in the Guardian\u2019s review, which was mostly positive, the theme of her age was never far away. Madonna is not alone in being seen through the prism of age. In 2014, looking ahead to Kate Bush\u2019s live shows at Hammersmith Apollo, a (male) critic at the Independent cringed at the idea that she might start dancing. \u201cHowever beneficial any yoga regime she might follow,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s simply unbecoming for a woman of a certain age to be prancing about, and certainly not in the leotard and leg-warmers of the 1979 shows.\u201d In fighting to do her job at 60, Madonna is, as ever, blazing a trail. Do we really think that Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift will simply down tools when they reach 45 and take up knitting? The fact she is still annoying people by doing the job she has been doing for 35 years would suggest she\u2019s a long way from being irrelevant. In the minds of her most vicious detractors \u2013 the ones that jeered with hilarity as \u201cgrandma\u201d fell off the stage at the 2015 Brits \u2013 she would be better off binning the fishnets, putting on a nice cardie and waiting for death. Even the more moderate language used in relation to her is revealing. \u201cDignity\u201d crops up a lot, as does \u201cappropriate\u201d and \u201cgrowing old gracefully\u201d. When men talk about women ageing gracefully, they are not acting out of concern. They\u2019re telling them to know their station, to sit down and shut up. \u201cPeople have always been trying to silence me for one reason or another, whether it\u2019s that I\u2019m not pretty enough, I don\u2019t sing well enough, I\u2019m not talented enough, I\u2019m not married enough \u2013 and now it\u2019s that I\u2019m not young enough,\u201d Madonna told Vogue recently. \u201cNow I\u2019m being punished for turning 60.\u201d Tracey Thorn, the Everything but the Girl singer-turned-solo artist and author, last year shared her objections to being described as \u201ca 55-year-old wife and mother\u201d in a review by the American music writer Robert Christgau. \u201cThe more I think about it the crosser I\u2019m getting,\u201d she said on Twitter. \u201c\u201855-year-old husband and father.\u2019 I\u2019m trying to imagine it as a description in an album review. Nope. Can\u2019t do it.\u201d I have no right to throw stones here. In 2003 I interviewed Siouxsie Sioux, an artist I\u2019d admired for as long as I could remember. Near the end of our chat I asked blithely if musical retirement was on the cards. She was 45. She gave me a proper bollocking, and pointed out \u2013 rightly \u2013 that I would never have asked a man that question. Ultimately it all boils down to what society deems alluring and acceptable. Older men, with their silver hair and laughter lines, are seen as stately and wise. Women of the same age are past it and embarrassing. Today, Iggy Pop (72) gets to run around shirtless during live performances. Nick Cave (61) dyes his hair and wears his shirts slashed to the waist; Elton John (72), who this year spoils us with a film, a memoir and a farewell tour, gads about in shades and diamante-encrusted suits. What links them, beyond their occupation, is that they get to decide how they conduct themselves and, crucially, when they stop working. And they get to do this without fear of criticism or vitriol. It\u2019s high time female artists enjoyed the same privilege. \u2022 Fiona Sturges is an arts writer specialising in books, music, podcasting and TV"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
