They now understand why the 500ft hill, with its vast view of the Somerset plains, is a special place. The year 8 pupils have been brought here as part of their religious education studies. They started the year learning about sacred places and pilgrimages. Now they have made their own to the West Country town steeped in its spiritual history of druids, ley lines, Joseph of Arimathea and the holy grail, and the grave of King Arthur in the Saxon abbey's grounds. \"You can explain what a special or sacred place is, but to experience it is the only way to really understand it,\" says RE teacher Ian Jamison. \"You have to be there for it to be transformative. Pilgrimages tend to be in groups and so it is good to go in a group. \"When you stand on the top of the Tor, it feels like nothing else. It must have been truly wonderful and bizarre when it was an island standing out of the marshes. People have constructed mythologies and stories around it, some manipulated, for example, by the monks who just happened to find the graves of King Arthur and Guinevere in their abbey, prompting the pilgrimages - and the money that comes with them. Even today, the town's economy is largely driven by spiritual visitors.\" Unplanned incidents Jamison may not be everybody's idea of an RE teacher with his cropped hair and pigtail and cowboy boots. But his innovative teaching style and passion for his subject led him to be named winner of the Guardian award for teacher in a secondary school in last year's Teaching Awards. He teaches at the 1,200-pupil Kingsbridge community college in south Devon. He first led school trips to Glastonbury when he worked at schools nearby, but thinks it is worth the two-and-half-hour coach trip it takes from Kingsbridge, despite a few unplanned incidents on the way, such as finding a naked man on top of the Tor. The pupils start off at Glastonbury Abbey, pottering around the ruins with worksheets asking them to find King Arthur's grave. They hear from an actor playing a monk about life in a Saxon monastery and are told about the town's interesting visits from Jesus, Joseph of Arimathea, St Patrick and St David. The pupils enact making bread and the monk explains that the top part of the loaf went to the nobles - the upper crust - and the children got the burned bit at the bottom. The Kingsbridge pupils want to know who the children are if the monks are not allowed to have sex. The object, for Jamison, is not to deconstruct the stories and myths of Glastonbury. \"The point is for them to experience the story, but not say if it is true,\" he says. \"That is not what is important in RE. I cannot say the Christian stories are authentic and the New Age worshippers and pagans are weirdos, especially as in the UK traditional religious groups are on the decline and people doing their own spiritual thing are on the increase. \"RE is a very important part of discourse and its increasing relevance has been partly driven by events such as 9/11. But I think it is part of the zeitgeist - RE is something that people want to talk about. You have [evolutionary biologist] Richard Dawkins on the one side, and people making strong religious statements on the other. Children need RE if they are to interpret the world around them. People are saying this is the truth and they have to have the ability to decide what stories they want to buy into or not. \"One of the things the kids in my classes learn is that there is not necessarily a right or wrong answer. RE is a subversive subject. You are encouraging people to think for themselves. Encouraging them to think what is right and what is wrong. People on one level want children to do that - but on another they don't really. I get paid to blow people's minds - and I get mine blown away too. When I walk into an RE lesson I have no idea where it will go. We have the most fabulous discussions.\" The trip makes an impression on the year 8 pupils. \"I thought it would be like Dartmoor, a bit boring, but it was different and really atmospheric,\" says Emily. \"I sat on the Tor in silence and I could let my imagination run wild. You really listen to Mr Jamison's lessons. He is very free and you can believe what you want. I am not sure of my religion yet.\" Jack is also waiting to make up his mind: \"I think what you got out of the trip depends on the basis of your religion, and I have not made my mind up yet. I have only been around for 13 years and have not seen all that much. The water from the well does taste like blood and it depends on whether you believe the legend about the holy grail, but if you do not, it could be because of the iron ore in the stone.\" Special place Alastair is more convinced: \"Glastonbury felt like a very special place. On top of the Tor you felt you could see all over the world. I think Joseph of Arimathea could have come here.\" RE is growing in popularity, interest fuelled in part by the short GCSE course. It is also gaining favour with politicians. Gordon Brown believes it can play a part in social cohesion and sees it being used to combat extremism, with RE teachers playing a role in the fight against terrorism. Jamison agrees: \"You cannot get on with people you do not understand. But the issue is muddied by faith schools. They may look at different religions but they say this one is right.\" Ofsted has reported that the standard of RE teaching is patchy. Jamison says: \"A recent survey found that 53% of RE teachers have not studied the subject post A-level. I can run a very switched-on GCSE class because I have studied the subject thoroughly and am passionate about it. I have also changed the way I teach after I attended a conference run by [researcher] Spencer Kagan about collaborative teaching. I managed to convince my head to let us to go to Florida for a course that transformed my teaching and what I am about. My approach now is not 'what will I teach today?' but 'What do I want my class to learn?'\" Jamison's main interest is Hinduism, which he first studied as a student at Bristol University. When he became a teacher, he could not find an A-level textbook on the subject, so he wrote one. And his next school trip? He will be taking 12 A-level students on a two-week tour of India in October. He promises it will be life-changing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
