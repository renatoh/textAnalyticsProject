Duncan Edwards", "bodyText": "Job: managing director, the National Magazine Company Age: 40 Industry: publishing Staff: 700 2003 ranking: new entry As managing director of the National Magazine Company, Duncan Edwards oversees a stable of titles including Cosmopolitan, Esquire, Company and Harpers &amp; Queen. The publisher, part of the giant Hearst Corporation, has several launches in the pipeline, including a weekly celebrity title to take on Emap's Closer, and has also teamed up with the US publisher of Men's Health, Rodale, to launch a range of health and fitness titles. \"This is an incredibly exciting venture,\" said Mr Edwards. \"Natmags and Rodale's instinct is to be very long-term about publications. Both companies are well established in the business of publishing internationally recognised power brands with real longevity that either define, or perform at, the top of their market sector.\" He has been at NatMags since 1989, when he joined as ad director for Company magazine, becoming its publisher two years later. Since then he has risen through the ranks, becoming managing director two years ago. Having impressed in his first 18 months in the job, in which he also oversaw a company restructure, Mr Edwards took on a more high profile role last year following the retirement of NatMags' president and chief executive Terry Mansfield. As deputy managing director in 2000, Mr Edwards oversaw the company's acquisition of Prima and Best publisher Gruner and Jahr, snatched from under the noses of IPC, and specialist bridal group Aim Publications. He has just appointed former Company editor Sam Baker to edit Cosmopolitan, the former women's glossy market leader which lost its crown to Conde Nast's Glamour. Mr Edwards showed his irritation at the departure of former Cosmopolitan boss Lorraine Candy, who quit to join Elle while still on maternity leave. In a farewell statement, he said Candy \"has been on maternity leave for a significant proportion of the last two years\" and said the acting editor had done \"a wonderful job\". Candy described the comments as \"shameful\". A keen rugby player, he is also a director of the National Readership Survey and the Periodical Publishers' Association."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
