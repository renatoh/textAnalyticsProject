For now, a first victory in their third appearance at the tournament represents the summit for Wardlaw and his team-mates. England in Christchurch on Sunday night, looking more Ben Nevis than the Eiger\u2019s North Face after Eoin Morgan\u2019s team\u2019s harrowing loss to New Zealand on Friday, is the 10th opportunity to make history. Before their second Pool A fixture, the message from Scotland\u2019s assistant coach Paul Collingwood, seen muscularly patrolling the boundary rope in a sleeveless T-shirt during their three-wicket defeat by the co-hosts in Dunedin on Tuesday, could not be simpler: their opponents are the team under pressure. Not that his old team truly know the meaning of the word, insists Collingwood, who was part of the management team when the captain Preston Mommsen\u2019s 78 helped successfully chase 261 against Kenya in the World Cup qualifier early last year, sealing their place in the main event. That tense finale at Hagley Oval, the venue for this encounter, opened the former England all-rounder\u2019s eyes to the make-or-break nature of cricket at associate level. \u201cYou take it for granted as an England player \u2013 you\u2019re always at the big tournaments,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the qualifying tournament the emotions were incredible. [The Scottish team] were literally playing for their jobs. With consequences like that you understand what real pressure is. In a way the pressure is off once you\u2019ve reached the finals.\u201d Cricket Scotland, whose \u00a32.1m annual revenue is one-60th that of the England and Wales Board, employs nine players on central contracts, the highest of which is worth \u00a330,000 a year \u2013 a far cry from the six-figure sums their opposite numbers pocket. But with six county cricketers and 68,000 active participants back home, along with 2,000 coaches, the Scots draw from a wider talent pool than Ireland. And yet unlike their fellow associates, who have embarrassed Pakistan, England and West Indies in successive World Cups, for Scotland that breakthrough maiden victory remains elusive. \u201cIt is a hurdle for us,\u201d Collingwood told the BBC\u2019s Test Match Special. \u201cThe players know they are close and getting closer. They can handle pace and spin and they can be one of the best fielding sides in the tournament.\u201d That analysis will raise eyebrows from those who watched Scotland subside to 12 for four in their opener with New Zealand before a stand of 97 in 23.3 overs between the centrally contracted Richie Berrington and the Sussex left-hander Matt Machan steered the side to 142 all out. The Kiwis, in the hunt for a quick kill, ended seven down as Wardlaw and his fellow seamer Josh Davey claimed three wickets apiece. Machan\u2019s role in the recovery, a calmly constructed 79-ball 56, came as no surprise to his county coach Mark Robinson, who believes the 24-year-old\u2019s international career \u2013 courtesy of a 2012 change in criteria that allowed the Brighton-born batsman to be selected by virtue of his Scottish mother \u2013 is helping to fully round a promising young talent. \u201cPlaying for Scotland has done him a lot of good,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cHe had an outstanding breakthrough season for Sussex in 2013 but hadn\u2019t quite got his identity in a strong team. Becoming a leading player for Scotland, and the responsibility that comes with that, has given him self-worth. He\u2019s a very destructive and counterattacking player at his best \u2013 a born striker of the ball.\u201d Scotland will hope Machan\u2019s arrival at the crease against England comes with a sturdier foundation \u2013 a base camp, if you will \u2013 than that in their last outing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
