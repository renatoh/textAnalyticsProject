Nothing more strenuous than raising a Bloody Mary to the last of the summer tourists, bemoaning the lack of rain and its consequences for the garden, and congratulating yourself, once more, on the sense, taste and good fortune that brought you to live in this small corner of rural France. But this year something is different. The tranquil, winding lanes; the mellow, unspoiled villages; the picturesque, expensively restored cottages with the views to die for - all are are abuzz. Petitions are being signed. Meetings are being organised. Associations are being formed. Rumours are circulating. Threats are being exchanged. Dordogne daggers, in short, are drawn. In the one corner stand the Brooker-Careys, proud British owners since 2003 of the Domaine de Bagatelle, a breathtaking hilltop estate between Nontron and Brant\u00f4me: a 17th-century manor house and period outbuildings around a gravelled courtyard; 70 hectares (175 acres) of rolling woodland; vistas that stretch for up to 30 miles across an area of exceptional natural beauty. David Brooker-Carey made his millions in aluminium smelting; his wife, Sandra, is a property developer from south-east London. Together, they have plans to turn part of their new home into a historic car museum, vehicle restoration workshop, luxury country club with fitness centre, and a 1920s-style country house hotel. The centrepiece of the Brooker-Careys' project, however, is a nine-metre-wide, 2.8-mile long motor racing circuit for vintage cars, complete with skidpan. They estimate that the track, which would wind through most of the estate, would be in use for about 240 days a year; the whole complex could expect to draw up to 40,000 visitors annually. Which explains why, standing in the other corner, are most of the Brooker-Careys' neighbours: locals and expats who are not overjoyed at the prospect of several dozen noisy, polluting, 50- to 80-year-old Ferraris, Bugattis, Porsches, Bentleys and Jags roaring up and down the green hills half a mile or so from their prized - and hitherto peaceful - homes. \"This is a major, multimillion euro project in an area that badly needs a good dose of outside investment,\" insisted Mr Brooker-Carey. \"We have massive local support, background political support. There's an enormous amount of interest from around the world; this project is unique. The only people objecting are second-home owners with some kind of fantasy idea about life in rural France.\" The project has the approval of the International Automobile Federation, which likes the idea of the first racetrack in the world built specifically for vintage cars. The Brooker-Careys' opponents include a retired creative director for the BBC, a former lecturer in textile design, a Belgian organic sheep farmer and a world expert on millipedes. They may be genteel, but they are determined. Their association, Court Circuit (Short Circuit), has more than 40 members, and their petition has gathered more than 1,000 signatures so far. \"Most of the signatories are French,\" said Christopher Drew, one of its leading lights, \"though I have to admit it's sometimes a bit of a struggle to persuade the locals. For many of them, the B-Cs are lord and lady of the manor. They don't see what we see, because we're English.\" If the project ever gets off the ground, its opponents argue, few jobs will come the locals' way because most of the posts will be technical. Christopher Hughes, who bought his house in the area in 1989 raises another objection. \"To my knowledge, at least three sales have fallen through over the past few months because of worries about this whole thing,\" he said. \"People don't come to the Dordogne to have a racetrack on their doorstep.\" Jocelyne Martin, the French president of Court Circuit, lives half a mile from La Bagatelle. She said: \"It's barely imaginable that people could be so insensitive not just to their natural surroundings, but to the community, to what's appropriate. There are towns that would pay you for this kind of project. But here? It's madness.\" Thibault d'Harveng, a Belgian, says the project is \"so unrealistic it makes you think it's all some kind of financial scam. It's so nouveau riche. Who are these people? We're in the middle of a regional nature park here\". And that may be the objectors' trump card. The Brooker-Careys stress theirs is a private project on private land, and that they will build their circuit \"in full compliance with all standards and norms\". But the Domaine de Bagatelle is in the middle of the P\u00e9rigord Limousin regional nature park. It sits on a ridge that overlooks two valleys, one of which is a European nature reserve and the other of which soon may be. Desmond Kime, an eminent retired biologist, says three dozen threatened \"red list\" species - from European mink, big spotted lizards and nesting peregrine falcons to rare toads, otters and black woodpeckers - live in an area he calls \"one of the most precious and biodiverse natural habitats left in Europe\". \"Motorways have been stopped because of just one of these species. Imagine what the noise would do to nesting birds. Imagine the run-off, the effect of petrol and oil finding their way into these perfectly pure rivers. And the air. This is really a very special place; a disturbance of this kind would do enormous harm.\" The local prefecture says it is still far too early to rule on the Brooker-Careys' \"interesting\" project. And as a former French minister once famously said: \"If you want to drain the marsh, don't consult the frogs.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
