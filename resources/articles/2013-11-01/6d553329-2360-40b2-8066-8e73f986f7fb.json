The work, funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, shows that a third of the 1.3 million families with children living in poverty are \"single breadwinner couple families\". There are half that number of two-earner families living in poverty. While the traditional model of families has long been in decline as many more women have moved into the workforce, they represent a key electoral constituency with around a quarter of couples with children having only one earner in 2012, equivalent to around 1.6 million families. The JRF's work shows that the risk of poverty is much higher for children in couple families where only one parent works. In 2011/12, around 20% of children living in sole-earner couple families in Britain fell below the poverty line \u2013 compared with 4% where both parents worked full-time. The foundation argues for a mix of measures to support parents who want to share work and childcare, rather than pursue the traditional single breadwinner model \u2013 centred around increasing parental leave, making childcare affordable and not sharply reducing benefits if the non-working partner gets a job. In particular the study is critical of the government's flagship welfare reform: universal credit. It points out that as soon as a second earner enters work 65p of every \u00a31 earned will be lost to withdrawn benefits. \"This could affect 900,000 potential second earners,\" warns the JRF. Katie Schmuecker, policy and research manager at JRF, said: \"The traditional family model where one parent \u2013 usually dad \u2013 goes out to work and supports his family does not offer a guaranteed route out of poverty in Britain today. Our low pay jobs market means many families that are reliant on a single breadwinner find it hard to make ends meet. \"Measures like the living wage, supporting people to progress into better jobs and ensuring it always pays to work more will all help increase household incomes. So too will helping more families to become dual earning households.\" There is also concern that poorer families have missed out on employment opportunities \u2013 feeling keenly the period of economic stagnation since the crisis began in 2008. While employment levels among mothers in couple families with pre-school children have risen since 1997 and continued to do so between 2008 and 2012, the JRF warns low-skilled mothers in couple families have seen their employment prospects \"weaken considerably\" during the recession. The Department for Work and Pensions argued its new benefits regime would see \u00a3200m worth of new childcare support, along with the existing support, to help 100,000 families with their childcare costs for the first time. A department spokesperson said: \"The government is tackling poverty by making work pay and growing the economy to raise living standards. There are more people in work than ever before, and we're helping families by taking 2.7 million people out of income tax altogether, freezing fuel duty and providing working families with support for the costs of childcare. Universal credit is a vital reform that rewards work and clearly improves incentives for second earners to take up work as well as helping 100,000 families with childcare costs for the first time.\" Lucy Powell MP, Labour's shadow minister for childcare and children said: \"Under David Cameron's cost-of-living crisis many families are finding one income alone is not enough to make ends meet at the end of each month. He has hit families with a triple-whammy childcare crisis of falling places, rising costs and cuts to support. \"While David Cameron stands up only for a privileged few, Labour will make it easier for parents to manage work and family by making work pay and extending free childcare provision for 3 and 4-year-olds with working parents from 15 to 25 hours a week and give parents a guarantee of wrap-around care for all primary school children.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
