I booked on a trip to Reserva Faunista Peninsula Valdes on the Atlantic coast of Argentina. I left sleepy Trelew and moved to coastal Puerto Madryn, which I can only compare to a slightly more upmarket Benidorm. Packed with Argentinians during this, the peak season, Puerto Madryn doesn't offer quaint, old world charm or stunning beaches, but it's a pleasant enough place and easy jump off point for the peninsula. The scenery on the drive there was striking in a barren sort of a way with not a single building breaking the horizon. It's the sort of scenery that you don't mind napping through when you realise that the first 20 minutes offers exactly the same view as the next three hours will. We were promised interesting wildlife and weren't disappointed. At Punta Norte, we found a huge colony of southern sea lions, hundreds of them lined the shore; fully grown dominant males (the technical term, not just my interpretation), regular males, females and groups of cubs trying not to get squashed in the midst of the chaos. The sound that sea lions make is part bark, part bray and part angry yell. It's the most phenomenal din and I would have given anything to know what they were screaming about. The males are huge lumbering creatures weighing up to 350kg. Their huge hairy heads are almost disproportionate to their bodies and as the odd one lifted his head to yell something, the profile did resemble a lion in some ways. They were fascinating to watch as they defended their mates. There's a shortage of female sea lions here, so the women are fought over in some fierce looking brawls. The male will guard her by placing his huge body in front of hers, if another potential suitor dares to approach, he will go for him with a huge roar and a lunge for the throat, not dissimilar to a Saturday night outside the Blue Orchid nightclub in Croydon! Southern Right whales (known here as Orcas) travel around the peninsula and are often seen on the shore at the colony. Our guide said that there was a sighting just an hour before we arrived, but I'm becoming a little cynical about the words of tour guides who always seem to claim that you've just missed the most significant wildlife spotting opportunity. From there we went to Punta Delgado to watch some elephant seals. This might have been a slight oversell as \"watching\" wildlife implies that they might do something. These chaps however, were static, grey lumps on the shore and we waited with baited breath for the odd movement. They come on to shore to rest and moult after feeding and whilst are fast in the sea, they struggle with movement. Watching one trying to heave itself around made me want to offer it a piggy-back, apparently though, it's not advisable. All this with a few guanacos, more penguins, armadillo and some rhea thrown in combined to make for a very fruitful Patagonian day. Argentinian buses are extremely comfortable with standard seats on some buses rivalling business class on certain airlines. The 15-hour journey to Bariloche in the Argentinian Lake District passed without event until we saw the most spectacular sunrise over the Andes. The dramatic skies morphed from a cauldron of fiery reds and oranges right through the palette to golden threads across a crisp blue sky, the perfect complimentary addition to the on bus \"entertainment\". My shrinking budget has dictated that I must venture back into the mysterious world of budget hostels complete with mixed dorms, queues for often unsavoury bathrooms and travellers who make me look and feel like I'm a 100-years-old. I met Niamh and Ellen, two Irish travellers, on the bus and checked into the same hostel, where I got a room with three Argentinian men who fortunately had discovered the joys of clean socks. Ellen and Niamh adopted me for the duration of our stay in Bariloche and turned into travelling Pied Pipers, picking up other assorted waifs and strays along the way. Together we went on a boat trip on Lake Nahuel Huapi, soaking up the spectacular mountain backdrops, and braving a short hike to some waterfalls and a beautiful mountain lake. We also discovered the Bariloche nightlife and the joys of an afternoon beer. It might have been the beer that led me to my moment of madness in which I decided that paragliding would be a great idea. The others didn't take much persuasion (also beer induced) and soon we had another young recruit, Ash, and the four of us were booked to throw ourselves off a cliff at around 9am on Sunday. Personally I blame the whole Netjetters thing for my momentary fits of craziness as I try to think of things to do which might be interesting for you to read. With the paraglide booked, any sensible group of travellers would have had a simple meal and an early night. Instead we found ourselves still in a bar at 7am and decided that a few hours sleep would do more harm than good. Luckily a freak shower postponed the venture until the afternoon and at around 2pm, four travellers carrying a green tinge were travelling up the Cerro Otto cable car, three were cursing me and all four of us were cursing the Guardian. The paraglide at around \u00a324 had seemed a bargain, but at the top of that mountain I could suddenly think of a million more sensible ways to spend the money, none of which involved sailing through the air over a lake with nothing but a flimsy bit of cloth to support you. We donned some unattractive flying suits, listened carefully to some complicated instructions, watched as they checked the kit and then, all strapped in, I waited for the wind to carry my instructor and I away. After the initial shock of being pulled up into the air, once all the kit and my backside was in the right position, I looked around and took in the fact that I was flying! It was the most mind-blowing experience; hundreds of metres beneath me microscopic people were walking around Bariloche town. Ahead of me, the shining blue water of the lake twinkled in the sunshine and the surrounding mountains suddenly looked closer. I couldn't find any words except for \"wow\" (verbal genius) and was quite literally speechless for most of the amazing 35-minute flight. Ernesto, the instructor, let me \"drive\" for a while and what an incredible feeling it was to soar through the sky led only by the wind and a gentle tug on some bits of string. It was so tranquil up there, like everyone and everything else had stood still, watching our flight. I could have stayed up there for longer, just floating in the clean air, but as they say, what goes up... And down we came, at an average of around one metre per second into a clearing with the canopy tumbling down after us. The four of us all agreed that paragliding is officially the best cure for a hangover as we compared notes on our flights still buzzing from the adrenaline rush. Ellen's instructor had pointed out a condor below. Not bad for a day's travelling work - flying higher than a condor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
