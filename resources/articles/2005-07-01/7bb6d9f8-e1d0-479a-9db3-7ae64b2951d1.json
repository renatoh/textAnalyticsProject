And having appointed Bradby and poached Daisy Sampson from the BBC as chief political correspondent, ITV News editor in chief David Mannion has already professed himself the proud owner of the \"best-looking Westminster bureau in British broadcasting\". But Bradby, newly promoted from the post of UK editor to replace the BBC-bound Nick Robinson, has no time to consider the fripperies of his new role. In fact, he has barely been able to consider his new job at all, having spent most of the past two weeks on screen, trying to keep abreast of the aftermath of the July 7 bombings. Yet it is clear the position is one he had set his sights on for a while. \"In a way this is a job I've wanted since I came to ITN, quite consciously. If I had to pick out one ambition at ITN that would probably have been it. Probably more than being Mark Austin, say. So I'm totally thrilled and really excited,\" he says. With Austin, a \"good mate\", later this year adding the 10.30pm news to his early evening brief when Sir Trevor McDonald stands down, the reshuffle marks a changing of the guard. Smooth, engaging and authoritative Bradby and Austin may be, but some critics wonder whether they lack gravitas and individuality. If that is the case, it is not something that is going to keep Bradby up at nights. \"I think it's quite interesting that all political editors have been, to put it politely, a bit eclectic and a bit different. I suppose I'm the straightest one there's been for a while, so maybe that's what makes me different,\" he muses, adding that he hopes to be more of a team player than previous incumbents. But he will not be developing an arm-waving tic or donning an outlandish tie in an effort to stand out. \"My journalistic heroes are the people who broke Watergate. That's what I get up in the morning dreaming of. To try and sit there worrying about whether I've got some particular style would be an utter disaster and not helpful at all. Although, obviously I will be wearing a false wig and a full- length leather coat with an open- necked shirt,\" he laughs. There will also be a less ego-fuelled approach, says Bradby, while accepting that his own contacts with the big hitters will be key. \"Unless you have the best contacts, you're struggling. So a huge amount of my energy is going to have to go into developing those contacts, not just individually but as a team. \"Traditionally, this hasn't been a team job but one that has tended to orientate around the political editor. Maybe it still will but I'd like to use the team more broadly than in the past to get a more co-ordinated approach,\" he says of a job he says he can see himself doing for the next decade. Bradby has an impressively wide array of roles on his CV. After a spell as producer for Michael Brunson, from whom he says he learnt the importance of the \"lost arts\" of packaging and great writing, his 15 years at ITN have included spells as Northern Ireland correspondent, political correspondent and Asia correspondent. \"What I learned is that what I think doesn't count. You've got to listen to people closely and see what they think. It reinforced to me the need to have very good contacts, listen very carefully and not wander around with a big ego thinking you know everything, because you don't,\" he says of his time in Northern Ireland. It was while in Asia covering post-election riots in Indonesia that he suffered a compound fracture to his leg after being hit by a flare. Concern for his three young children and a lot of soul-searching led him to return home for a spell as royal correspondent, seen by some as an odd move. But he took to the role enthusiastically and can see lessons for ITV's political coverage in that too, particularly in the need to inject a touch of humour. After recovering from his apoplectic rage at the BBC's decision to woo back Robinson, Mannion has also greeted the latest bout of musical chairs as an opportunity to change the way the network covers politics. He has said that he wants Bradby and his team to get out and about more, connect the issues to the regions and talk to people beyond the Westminster village. It was a rationale that informed ITV's coverage of the last election and one with which Bradby wholeheartedly concurs. \"Sometimes our Westminster coverage has felt too much like the Westminster village. As political editor you want to bring some of that excitement to the screen, but you have to be careful that you're not just broadcasting to the rest of the village,\" he says, pointing to a recent piece he fronted on binge drinking. \"It was a real example of how ITV pulls together and what happens when we do. People really noticed that piece.\" He has also been thinking deeply about how to engage viewers who are turned off by politics. It is clear that he is not going to suddenly become an aggressive rottweiler in the process: \"Viewers can't stand macho posturing on the part of journalists. They want light shed on the story, not heat. I think sometimes journalism is a bit too know-it-all and we just need to be a bit more mature about it, be a bit more balanced and take into account there are other views out there.\" But his humble approach belies a steely competitive core. He admits that Robinson's defection \"hurt\", carrying as it did the underlying message that the BBC job was still the bigger role. \"I don't think the BBC political editor's job is better than the ITV political editor's job. I really really don't. What we do that's slightly different is that on a good day we're really crisp, we're really swift moving, we strip away all the bullshit and give it to you straight. That's why I like working here - we're not sitting here having esoteric debates about the nature of the story,\" he says. ITV's coverage of the bombings on the 10.30pm news that day bore this out, he claims. \"I think we've had a great three years, we've been really resurgent. We had got to a pretty bad point and we've put a rocket up ourselves.\" Having got the job he always wanted, although he confesses that he quite fancies anchoring election night in the future, he is keen to make his mark. \"You look at the leaks that some of the Sunday newspapers get and you think - why don't we get some of those? They have a long tradition of being able to generate stories that set the agenda and we need to do an awful lot more of that. You can talk about whether I wear glasses or whatever but I'm just not interested in all that. I want to look back at five or six years of setting the agenda, really clear reporting, doing things slightly differently and hopefully bringing in stories. Then I'll be happy.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
