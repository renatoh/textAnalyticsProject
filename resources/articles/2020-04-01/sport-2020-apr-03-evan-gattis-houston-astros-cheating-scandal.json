Looking back, it feels like he lost. Gattis was with the Astros for their historic run, which since has been disgraced by revelations of a sign-stealing scheme that cost general manager Jeff Luhnow and manager AJ Hinch their jobs and a one-year ban from baseball. The repercussions swept up two other managers \u2013 the New York Mets fired Carlos Beltran and the Boston Red Sox parted with Alex Cora - who were part of the scheme in Houston in 2017. \u201cEverybody wants to be the best player in the fucking world, man,\u201d Gattis told the Athletic\u2019s 755 Is Real podcast. \u201cAnd we cheated that, for sure. And we obviously cheated baseball and cheated fans. Fans felt duped. I feel bad for fans. \u201cI\u2019m not asking for sympathy or anything like that. If our punishment is being hated by everybody forever, just like, whatever. I don\u2019t know what should be done, but something had to fucking be done. I do agree with that, big-time. I do think it\u2019s good for baseball that we\u2019re cleaning it up. ... And I understand that it\u2019s not fucking good enough to say sorry. I get it.\u201d Astros All-Stars Alex Bregman and Jose Altuve apologized publicly in brief statements at the start of spring training in February. Gattis, who retired after the 2018 season, isn\u2019t the first member of the 2017 team to air a guilty conscience. Blue Jays reliever Ken Giles, the Astros\u2019 closer in 2017, said he would give his World Series ring back if asked. Baseball launched an investigation after former Astros pitcher Mike Fiers, now with the Oakland Athletics, told the Athletic details of the sign-stealing operation, which included reviewing signs from a digital replay room and banging a garbage can a certain number of times based on the pitch that was coming. The Astros were stripped of first- and second-round draft picks in 2020 and 2021 and were fined $5m, but MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said the team would not lose its World Series title. The 33-year-old Gattis said he didn\u2019t think Hinch liked the team cheating by stealing signs and said Beltran and others didn\u2019t put pressure on players to participate. \u201cNobody made us do shit. You know what I\u2019m saying? People saying this guy made us, that guy made us, that\u2019s not it. But you have to understand the situation was powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cYou work your whole life to try to fucking hit a ball, and you mean you can tell me what\u2019s coming? It was like, \u2018What?\u2019 It\u2019s a powerful thing, and there\u2019s millions of dollars on the line and shit? And that\u2019s the bad of it, too, that\u2019s where people got hurt. And that\u2019s not right. That\u2019s not playing the game right.\u201d Former Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Mike Bolsinger filed a civil lawsuit against the Astros, alleging the sign-stealing caused a four-run, 29-pitch outing that effectively ended his career."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
