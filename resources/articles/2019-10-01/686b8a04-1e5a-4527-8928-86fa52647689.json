Who can blame them? The script to this point seems to demand nothing less. But it may also do its leading player something of a disservice, because the final scene that would confirm Enable\u2019s place among European racing\u2019s all-time greats is a long way from being a foregone conclusion. The 15th race of her career promises to be the most demanding assignment of all. The field is the smallest for a dozen years but there is a depth to the competition that was not there in 2017 \u2013 when Enable had all the allowances as a three-year-old filly \u2013 or 2018, when the year-younger Sea Of Class was seemingly beaten only by her draw. Sea Of Class was the obvious potential improver in last year\u2019s field and she got to within a nose of Enable. This year, though, Enable has three opponents with a similar profile: Sottsass, Japan and the four-year-old Ghaiyyath. All three are fresh, lightly-raced and have very little to find to give her a race. Enable\u2019s class, courage and will to win may see her through once again, but to justify quotes of 4-6, she should be several pounds clear of her field on ratings. Timeform\u2019s figures, though, have her behind Ghaiyyath before factoring in her 3lb mares\u2019 allowance. On the weight-adjusted ratings, Japan and Sottsass are 6lb and 7lb behind Enable, after eight and six races respectively. Both have scope for further improvement, Sottsass in particular, and Jean-Claude Rouget\u2019s runner has also been prepared solely with the Arc in mind. At the available prices, Ghaiyyath must be the value in the market at around 12-1 and potentially bigger still on the PMU. Perhaps it is his disappointing run in the Prix Ganay in April that sticks in some punters\u2019 minds, but that followed close behind his impressive first outing for six months. His first start at 12 furlongs, meanwhile, in last month\u2019s Grosser Preis at Baden, saw him put his exceptional stride to good use on the way to a 14-length success. The draw could have been kinder but the widest stall of 12 is much less of a challenge than 18 of 18, and in terms of his form, rating and scope for improvement, Ghaiyyath\u2019s chance to upset the favourite is as good, if not better, than that of Sottsass or Japan. An each-way bet at 12-1 is surely the way to go."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
