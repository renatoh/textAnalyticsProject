London's doucest and greenest borough of Richmond-upon-Thames was going quietly about its business. I was sitting in my car waiting for my partner to come from the shops. Suddenly a large and obviously embittered drunk came by. He swore at the world, told two girls sitting on an office doorstep that he would stab them, staggered, lurched on and, as she came round a corner, flattened my partner with a blow. She fell amid the dry cleaning she was carrying. Witnesses said she screamed, though she herself had no recollection of having done so. Horrified, I saw the whole thing in my rear mirror. He paused, as if thinking of kicking her, but by now I and some passers-by were running to help. He stumbled on. Later, we heard, he had continued his rampage, smashing a car window, punching a passer-by who protested and trying to throw a man into the Thames before finally being arrested. It was shocking, but it could have been worse. My partner had bruises and some cuts, but was admirably calm. We reflected that had we been in the US might well have had a gun and we were heartened too by the public spirit and concern of the witnesses. What was almost more irksome was the amount of time it took to process the evidence in Richmond's small and under-resourced police station. Statements were taken first by a clerkess who filled up a standard form on a computer. Then there was a long wait until detectives arrived. In the meantime a man in battle fatigues imperiously rapped on the locked glass door of the interview room, leering balefully in at us. It was all a bit nerve-racking. The woman dealing with our case excused herself and went outside with a form for him to sign. Our visitor, it turned out, was a Glasgwegian on bail who had obviously spent the day in the worship of Saint Tripun, as my father used to say, or boozing at the nappy like Tam O'Shanter. Meanwhile witnesses to the rampage were growing impatient. They had to wait while the clerkess, single-handed, took a statement from a man whose mobile phone had been stolen. Two women detectives finally arrived but before they could give us their attention a distraught mother turned up with her son. Her husband, she said, was psychotic and was on the second day of a two-day bender, creating mayhem in their home. Yes, said the son, he's already trashed my room. It's impossible to go home. What are you going to do? Nothing, said the detective wearily. No crime has been committed. But, said the son, surely you can do something. He's already been sectioned. The detective said she would see if a local patrol would accompany him back to the house to pick up some belongings, presumably leaving the father to rot amid the wreckage of his home. Three hours after the incident, my partner signed another statement, this time taken down in longhand by the detective, and we were finally free to go. It had altogether been a very odd afternoon, like an excerpt from an improbable police serial. We had seen a graphic illustration of something about which we had often read - the way that cumbersome procedures bring a bureaucratic sclerosis to police work, which is already stressful and exhausting. And so when I saw that in his speech setting out next year's legislative programme First Minister Jack McConnell had announced there would be a Bill to strengthen support for victims of crime my feeling was that this was an unquestionable priority. The Richmond police had offered to put us in touch with a victim support group and at all times, despite the frustrating delays and interruptions, had been caring and solicitous. But I am rather less comfortable with the proposal that victims should contribute to the sentencing process, even though the idea has won the support from such luminaries as Lord McCluskey. It sits uneasily with the notion of impartial justice, though the way the French system deals with its victims - by allowing them, as 'civil parties', formal legal representation at criminal trials - might be worth examination. No one can say that a legislative programme that includes land reform is timid. But there was a distinct feeling that McConnell had decided to observe Miss Piggy's dictum that 'you should never eat more than you can lift'. In other words, he may want a quiet year of legislative plod. After the headlines that have attended Parliament's first three years, who can blame him? But if he thinks carping coverage is about to stop, he is deceiving himself. After the Queen's visit to Parliament in Aberdeen, where it had decamped because of the General Assembly, Sir David Steel said that more sessions outside Edinburgh were being discussed. Cries of extravagance led by David McLetchie filled the air. Yet if we are to avoid the London disease - the Economist last week pointed out that booming Edinburgh promises to become as dominant and thrombotic - it is an entirely admirable notion. In any case, if he had wanted a quiet life McConnell wouldn't have gone into politics. As Alistair Darling said in an interview yesterday, his father, when told of his career choice, told him: 'It'll end in tears.' Harold Macmillan, asked what he most feared, replied: 'Events, dear boy, events.' Sooner or later McConnell will be plucked from the quiet life by the political equivalent of a rampaging drunk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
