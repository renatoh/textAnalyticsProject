All you need to know about prices, technology and range", "bodyText": "Of all the bizarre sideshows on the 2019 federal election trail, the pantomime around electric cars had to be one of the strangest. Scott Morrison argued that Labor\u2019s plan for 50% electric vehicles by 2030 would \u201cruin the weekend\u201d and the Liberal party paid for Facebook ads claiming Labor would confiscate tradies\u2019 Hilux utes. Meanwhile, all the world\u2019s big car manufacturers are busy getting on with electrifying their model ranges. But while things are changing, buying an EV is still a big leap. Guardian Australia spoke to experts about the options. What kind of price tag am I looking at? The price tag is still the biggest deterrent. Mike Sinclair, the editor of carsales.com.au, says things are improving \u2013 there are several models below $50,000, but prices are likely to fall further over the next few years. \u201cJust by critical mass, the cost of the vehicles will moderate but they won\u2019t become cheap,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd there will be more choice, which will inevitably make the market a bit more competitive.\u201d There are about a dozen models of pure EVs on the market in Australia from manufacturers including Hyundai, Kia, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Mercedes-Benz, Renault and Tesla, priced from $46,000 to well over $100,000. Recharging at superfast charging stations takes less than 30 minutes, or they can be charged overnight at home. That\u2019s a big change from a decade ago when, in 2006, the Guardian\u2019s then editor Alan Rusbridger bought an electric car in the UK that resembled something that Noddy would drive through Toyland. It was made mostly of plastic, had a top speed of about 45km/h, a range of 48km, just enough room for two small adults and cost \u00a39,000 ($18,000). EVs are now fast and luxurious in comparison \u2013 they can seat a family comfortably and have ranges measured in hundreds of kilometres. But there are only about 6,000 on Australia\u2019s roads. Will EVs get cheaper? And when? In the absence of government policy aimed at boosting uptake (the election campaign demonstrated the Coalition isn\u2019t keen to go down that road), the number of EVs on the road will shift substantially only when they approach price parity \u2013 selling for the same price or cheaper than the combustion-engined equivalent. Bloomberg New Energy Finance is relatively bullish about how long that will take. In 2017, it forecast that the crossover point was in 2026. Its 2019 analysis has this happening in 2022. While its projections are optimistic, the International Energy Agency and oil companies such as BP are predicting this will take place before 2030. A Deloitte report released in January put the tipping point at 2024. The falling cost of batteries is driving that optimistic outlook. For many years, electric vehicle batteries were said to account for half the car\u2019s total cost, but that figure has dropped dramatically. In 2015, the battery represented about 57% of the cost, in 2019 it was 33% and by 2025 Bloomberg NEF predicts it will be only 20%. Should I buy now or wait? This depends largely on personal circumstances and the reality is that more than half of all Australians buy used cars, rather than new, so for them it\u2019s not yet an option. In the next three to five years, there will be a larger range of EVs in the $40,000-$50,000 price bracket with a few under $40,000, Sinclair says, which could be an indication to wait. But in the meantime, the cost of operating a petrol car could be significant, particularly for high-mileage drivers. And with interest rates at record lows, the cost of financing a new car is lower than it has been for some time. What about a plug-in hybrid? Is that an option? Plug-in hybrids work in much the same way as regular hybrids, but they have larger batteries and can be plugged into the wall socket. They\u2019re a compromise between conventional hybrids and battery-only electric vehicles. Gail Broadbent is a PhD student at the University of New South Wales. She researches electric vehicles and owns a plug-in hybrid Mitsubishi Outlander SUV. Buying an EV is a good option for a family in the market for a second car, but for the primary vehicle it\u2019s worth looking at the option of a hybrid, she says. \u201cThey\u2019ll find most of their driving is running around locally, going to pick up kids, shopping and that\u2019s where an electric car is absolutely ideal because it\u2019s a lot cheaper to run one, it doesn\u2019t have the energy costs, assuming that they plug it in overnight and they have off-peak pricing. If you are looking at two-car families, now is an ideal time to buy.\u201d But plug-in hybrids, or PHEVs, also come with some widely recognised downsides. There\u2019s the expense and maintenance hassle of both the petrol engine and the electrical systems, and a high upfront cost. Sinclair says: \u201cThe reality is that the technology is expensive. For some of those vehicles it\u2019s almost like putting two powertrains in them \u2013 you have a conventional powertrain and you have an electric.\u201d And plug-in hybrids still consume fuel and produce CO2, which is the reason many people are looking for an alternative in the first place. What\u2019s the range of electric vehicles? Is it enough? Pure EVs on the market in Australia have battery ranges of anywhere from 200km to more than 500km \u2013 but generally the longer the range, the larger the batteries and hence the greater the overall cost. The Outlander, like many other PHEVs, has a 50km range on the battery, but will automatically switch over to petrol beyond that. Sinclair and Broadbent are keen to point out that range anxiety \u2013 the fear among buyers of running out of charge while driving \u2013 will continue to shape the electric vehicle market, despite that fear not actually matching reality. \u201c60km is enough range for about 80% of day-to-day driving, 170km range is about enough to satisfy 99% of driving trips,\u201d Broadbent says. \u201cTo expect a car that does more than 400km, which is what Tesla will do, you have to be the sort of person that wants to drive from Sydney to Canberra without having to stop.\u201d \u201cThe whole issue of range anxiety is a very interesting one,\u201d Sinclair says. \u201cThe first crop of electric vehicles will probably have more range than people need but it\u2019s the range that people want.\u201d What about a regular hybrid? Hybrids are not really electric vehicles in the sense of the two other options because all their energy is still taken from fossil fuels, but their widespread adoption shows how quickly something that was once a niche technology can become mainstream in a short time. It\u2019s a glimpse of what EV price parity could look like. Toyota was the first to bring hybrids to the Australian market with the Prius in 2001 and has sold more than 100,000 since then. This year, the Japanese carmaker released a hybrid version of its RAV4, which exceeded the company\u2019s sales predictions. Dealers say about three-quarters of customers are now asking for the hybrid version, compared with company estimates of about 40%. That has caused a shortage and the waiting times have blown out to four months despite the vehicle going on sale only a month ago. Toyota Australia\u2019s vice-president for sales and marketing, Sean Hanley, said that uptake exceeded their expectations. \u201cWe are not surprised that hybrid is growing in the Australian market at all. What we might be a little surprised at is the weight of the sales mix is a lot higher than we anticipated. It\u2019s a good thing. \u201cOur order intake suggests that over 60% of our future sales will be hybrid variants and that exceeds our own plan.\u201d Hanley says that mix may settle down to about half of all future sales, but demand will remain strong. \u201cWhat that says is Australians are mindful of CO2, they\u2019re mindful of the cost of running a car and they see hybrid as a credible practical technology that\u2019s affordable and requires no infrastructure and no range anxiety.\u201d Toyota, along with most major carmakers, has plans to electrify its entire range in the future, including the use of plug-in hybrids, fuel-cell electric and battery electric models. \u201cNo one technology will necessarily be the silver bullet to the future of mobility, the market will determine that,\u201d Hanley says. To paraphrase Henry Ford, in future you\u2019ll be able to have any model you want, as long as it\u2019s electric."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
