I've written an opera that opens in Lisbon in January, a libretto called Evil Machines. It's an adaptation of a short story I wrote, and I got rather caught out when they asked me to direct it as well, because as I was writing, I did wonder how on earth the director would manage to pull it off. How does one get huge machines on the stage? You can't cover the actors' heads up. How are they going to be able to hear the orchestra or expand their lungs? How long has this been going on? Forever. I've recently done a lecture tour on how Richard II was misunderstood. People have this idea that he was a tyrant; actually he was murdered by Henry IV, who then had to invent all this propaganda to gain public favour. So really, political games have always been going on. It's always the same people wanting power. War is always about money, whether its Caesar or Halliburton. There, that's a nice easy answer, isn't it? How deep is your love? What an impossible question. It's one I keep asking myself. I don't know. Isn't that what we spend our lives trying to find out? Love is constantly being tested. My personal love is a slowly maturing beast. It's not instant. Are friends electric? I think friends galvanise you. In fact, the origin of the word galvanize comes from Luigi Galvani, the man who first put an electrical current through dead frogs. In that sense, friends can bring you back to life. Who wants to be a millionaire? Money does help. The academic tours I do are possible because of royalties, so I'm very lucky. I have no idea how academics who haven't done Python survive on what they get paid. What's the meaning of life? Ha! It's exactly what it says in the film. Doing as much as you can, getting as much out of it as you can, while you're alive. As you get older, everything is less surprising. As a child, the underside of a table is exciting. As an adult, you wouldn't even notice there's a table in the room. Do you really want to hurt me? I would hate to hurt anybody, especially you. What are we fighting for? We used to think we were fighting for a better, more understanding world. But now I'm not sure. What shall we do with the drunken sailor? Well, I enjoy wine and beer, but I don't enjoy getting drunk. In fact, I'd consume barrels of beer if it wasn't for the frustrating side effect of being drunk. Though I do remember once getting terribly drunk with Bob Hoskins right before he had to go on stage. He gave a very drunken performance. Do you believe in magic? Yes. For me, writing is magic, when you come up with the kinds of ideas which are actually better than what you think you can do. Like when Michael Palin read out the Spanish Inquisition sketch. Where on earth did that come from? Pure magic. Is this it? I'm not saying there's not life after death. But I do think it's very unlikely. In Egypt's Valley Of The Kings, the workers' tombs have pictures on them of what people imagined the afterlife would be, and their pictures are all of sewing, farming, and what they were doing in the present. I can't imagine car factory workers in Detroit wanting the afterlife to mirror this life. Yes, I think this is definitely it. \u00b7 Life Of Brian: The Immaculate Edition DVD is out now"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
