This is not hubris \u2013 I am fit and healthy and for years have followed a sensible physical regime and for me, though I grant this is a gamble, the virus is unlikely to be mortal. I am no Dominic Cummings fan, but with his famously off-the-wall thinking, he might consider a controlled policy of volunteers, such as myself, to be exposed to the virus under strict conditions so as not to spread, self-isolate during its onset and then be in a unique position to offer up ourselves for research, to provide antibodies, to ameliorate the disease and, finally, join those valiantly fighting to help. As a former psychotherapist who worked in the NHS, and especially with those with a mortal condition or whose loved ones had sadly died, I feel my services would currently be more worthwhile both to myself and others in that capacity than just dallying at home not getting on with writing my next novel.
