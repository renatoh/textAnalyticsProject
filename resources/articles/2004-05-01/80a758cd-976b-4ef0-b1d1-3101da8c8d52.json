Then we want to travel to Vanersborg or Trollhattan by bus or train. Will this be possible? We're also contemplating cycling along the Gota canal. Is it worth it? Diana Tremayne and Rachel Terry Bicycles can't generally be carried on inter-city trains or buses in Sweden, so you'll have to cycle everywhere. That said, the south of the country is flat and ideal for relaxed summer cycling. The Gota canal is worth it - it has a towpath and is a lovely ride, although it can get busy. For more information, visit www.gotakanal.se I am spending two weeks in Kyrenia, northern Cyprus, in June with my wife and other family members. Would you advise us on places of interest, car hire and public transport? Roy Clinton, Chesterfield Cyprus remains divided, even though it recently joined the European Union, so keep an eye on developments if you want to cross to the Greek Cypriot south. Kyrenia, (also called Girne) is one of the island's pleasantest resorts. Its old quarter is atmospheric. Buses link it with Lefkosia (Nicosia) and other destinations. It's easy to hire a car to get to the main sights, including the ancient city of Salamis and the Venetian city of Famagusta. There's more information about Northern Cyprus at www.holidayinnorthcyprus.com. Letter of the week My wife and I want to visit a long-lost cousin in Henryetta, Oklahoma, as part of a 10-day tour in a rented car, staying at budget hotels. We want to see small town America and stay near nice water. Brian Sharpe, by email Most famous as the home of legendary bull rider Jim Shoulders, Henryetta offers an unusual, authentic taste of small town life. You'll probably fly into Tulsa, or the state capital, Oklahoma City, where there are excellent art museums and a National Cowboy Museum. Drive between these cities on the longest remaining continuous stretch of Route 66 - you'll find pleasant detours in lakes and forests - then head south to Henryetta. Oklahoma is within driving distance of Memphis. Bridge The World (0870 444 1716; www.bridgetheworld.com) can arrange multi-stop USA itineraries.
