Little did he know that those next few seconds, which culminated in him sending his effort high over the Tottenham crossbar, would lead to some over-cooked criticism from Neil Warnock and an unseemly argument between the two, some of it carried out on Twitter. Now, wouldn\u2019t you know it, with the pair reunited at Palace, Warnock is talking in glowing terms about the player. But first, the argument. Warnock was working as a pundit on TalkSport in March when he brought up Puncheon\u2019s miss. He said on the radio station: \u201cThere\u2019s no way I would\u2019ve trusted him with a penalty. You\u2019ve got to have somebody a little bit more cool, and he\u2019s not like that, Jason. He can whack a 35-yard free-kick in here and there but a penalty, with all the pressure on him at a place like White Hart Lane \u2013 not in a million years for me.\u201d Puncheon responded with some tweets that he swiftly deleted. Warnock knew Puncheon well as he signed him on loan at QPR in 2011, although he clearly did not rate him that highly. In four months at Loftus Road, he only made two appearances, as a substitute, which perhaps explains those comments. However, when Warnock was appointed manager of Palace at the end of last month, he thought Puncheon was on his way out of the club. Warnock said: \u201cI was told he was going to ask to leave, before my first day. So I was waiting for him to ask but we just had a quick chat, only a 10-minute chat and he was brilliant really. I said I was pleased with him, I said he had been fantastic the last couple of years. He\u2019s been a revelation for me, him and [Yannick] Bolasie.\u201d Bolasie was as effective on the left wing as Puncheon was on the right. In the second half, Bolasie\u2019s cross forced Kasper Schmeichel into conceding a corner that was taken by Puncheon. Scott Dann headed it goalwards and Fraizer Campbell, bought for \u00a3900,000 from Cardiff City in July, flicked his shot past Schmeichel for his second goal in as many games. Three minutes later, Bolasie was hauled down by Wes Morgan outside the penalty area, Puncheon curled in the free-kick and Mile Jedinak glanced his header inside Schmeichel\u2019s far post. Game over and a second consecutive convincing league victory for Palace, who won 3-2 at Everton last Sunday. Palace\u2019s three-man strikeforce was too much for Leicester City to cope with. Six days after their thrilling 5-3 defeat of Manchester United, this was a poor follow-up performance by Nigel Pearson\u2019s men. Jamie Vardy and Leonardo Ulloa were not the same threat that they posed to Louis van Gaal\u2019s defence and Leicester\u2019s vulnerability to set pieces was exposed. Pearson, never one \u2013 on the surface at least \u2013 to swing between emotional highs and lows, was measured in his assessment of his team. \u201cI\u2019ll take time to reflect on the performance because there are certain things that clearly we\u2019ve got to improve on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for the most part the performances so far have been very encouraging and we\u2019ve had some positive results because of it.\u201d This was not one of them.
