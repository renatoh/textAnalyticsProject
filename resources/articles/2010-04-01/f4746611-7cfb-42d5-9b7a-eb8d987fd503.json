Alistair Darling insisted the increase would not damage jobs and was an important element of the government's plans to ensure Britain pulled out of recession. Ministers again questioned whether the Tories could find the cash to pay for scrapping the NI rise. They also ridiculed Conservative claims that the NHS would save \u00a3200m if the NI plan was abandoned \u2013 money that the party said it would spend on cancer drugs. Douglas Alexander, Labour's election coordinator, said: \"There's no doubt that the Tory messaging has got headlines in recent weeks \u2013 they started the year promising austerity and tough action on the deficit, but having come under pressure they have now changed their tactics, with a series of improbable rabbits out of seemingly bottomless hats. \"In the last week, the Tories have promised to cut taxes for employers, for employees, for married couples, and even the NHS; they've promised new cancer drugs for anyone who wants them and a new programme to create an army of community activists; and all at the same time as they have kept up their rhetoric on cutting the deficit faster and deeper than Labour. The words are cheap but the cost to the British people will be staggering.\" John Appleby, chief economist of the King's Fund health thinktank, said the Tories were involved in a sleight of hand, since substantial savings could not be made on a tax rise that had not yet been implemented. Appleby said: \"I find it very hard to see where the money is. This is like making a saving on a cost that has not been implemented yet. It is not a cost the NHS has to bear at the moment. \"It is a sleight of hand to say the least. The money is not there to be saved yet, so the money will have to come out of existing budgets.\" The King's Fund later said that Appleby had not intended to accuse the Tories of dishonesty. \"If the phrase 'sleight of hand' suggested this, he would wish to withdraw it,\" it said in a statement. Under pressure, the shadow health secretary, Andrew Lansley, said that the \u00a3200m would be found from \"existing efficiencies\". He also defended the right to give patients the broadest choice possible when it came to providing cancer treatments \u2013 remarks that seemed to suggest the Tories were pledging a massive increase in health spending. Lansley said: \"We need to give patients in the NHS an assurance that if they are very seriously ill and their doctor, their specialist, says to them: 'This is the best treatment for you, and it is a licenced medicine, we know it is clinically effective,' we need to arrive at a position where we put patients first and we give patients the treatment that their specialist believes is right for them. \"Contrary to what John Appleby has said, we have been very clear we are going to protect the NHS budget, we are going to increase the budget each year in real terms, so within that budget from next year onwards employers in the NHS don't have to spend \u00a3200m-plus on an increase in national insurance, they will have that money available to meet other needs.\" The shadow chancellor, George Osborne, insisted that the Tories had costed their initiatives: \"I think it comes down to priorities. Do we want the money going on additional national insurance in the NHS or on new cancer drugs?\" He also said that he would not have to raise taxes further to meet his pledge to remove the bulk of the structural deficit by the end of the next parliament, in 2014-15. He has not yet defined the bulk of the deficit, save to say it requires going further than Labour's plan to cut 70% of the deficit. \"The plans we set out involve around 80% of the work being done by spending restraint, about 20% coming from tax increases. The tax increases are already in place. The plans do not involve an increase in VAT,\" Osborne said. But he said that he, like any other \"shadow chancellor or chancellor in Britain over the recent decades\", could not absolutely rule out any future tax rises. He again claimed that the Conservatives could avoid the planned NI rise by finding \u00a36bn in efficiencies identified by two leading businessmen, Peter Gershon and Dr Martin Read. Osborne said shadow ministers had already identified extra waste the Tories planned to tackle in 2011, but Darling said Osborne was double counting efficiencies for which Labour had already budgeted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
