Public sector pensions, misunderstood and misrepresented, still matter not only to those who pay into them, or to the frustrated handful of people whose driving examiners are on strike this Friday in protest over the reform plans, but to everyone who values having a public sector. The steady erosion of opposition to the reform of public sector pensions is a success for David Cameron, a rare trophy from the coalition's first two years. As he acknowledged that the 2012 budget had run into a brick wall, he could at least list what he called standing up to public sector strikes. However much people value nurses or librarians, public sector workers as a category have few friends. Any sympathy for them over pension reforms that mean later retirement and higher contributions is tempered by the perception that they are better off than the private sector. Last month, a thinktank, the Intergenerational Foundation, pointed out that 78,000 public sector workers enjoyed annual pensions above the average wage, while the average public sector worker retired on a pension nearly twice that of the average private sector worker. The facts are more complicated. After all, 78,000 is a very small proportion of the 4 million who are claiming public sector pensions. Also, public sector pensioners tend to have been in relatively senior positions. What is undeniable is that public sector workers are still retiring on final salary schemes, a fond memory for almost everyone else. But getting pensions right is one of the most important long-term challenges facing government, and driving them down to the inadequate level of most in the private sector is the wrong answer. Getting people to save is what matters most, and guaranteeing a decent pension at the end of it is the best way of doing it. Raising contributions, especially for the low-paid, is more likely to stop them saving at all. Meanwhile, the National Employment Savings Trust scheme, into which workers in firms that do not run their own company pension will be automatically enrolled later this year, will not challenge private pension providers . The last bastion in the defence of the existing arrangements is manned by the doctors, teachers and civil servants . They risk making the government's case for it. Arguing over the relative fairness of what looks like one generous pension against another, as the BMA appears to be doing, is self-defeating. This row is not a serious economic argument, it is a piece of politics. The cost of public pensions is becoming more affordable, as Robert Chote of the Office for Budget Responsibility recently confirmed. That's because there is a fast-shrinking number of people working in the public sector."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
