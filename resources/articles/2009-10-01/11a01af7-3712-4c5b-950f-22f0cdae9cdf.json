In the sport's most optimistic future projections the opening rites of the artistic world championships at London's 2012 Olympic venue, the O2 Arena, might come to be recognised as the start of the sport's own Italia 90, its Botham's Ashes, a period of irreversible ascent into the sporting mainstream. That seems to be the idea, anyway. \"This is by far the biggest occasion we have ever organised. We didn't expect the interest to be so enormous,\" was the verdict of Vera Atkinson of British Gymnastics during an opening day that went off without hitches, albeit also without anything approaching a full house inside the 12,000-capacity dome. \"Ever since the [Beijing] Olympics people expect more and more. But these are the cream of the cream. For our gymnasts even achieving a place in the final here is a real feat.\" With this in mind, perhaps it was no surprise there were some early nerves. The first significant act for a largely partisan, largely primary school-age crowd was the appearance on the pommel horse of Daniel Keatings, the European junior champion and one of the great hopes of the British team. After twirling through his routine Keatings missed his grip and muffed his dismount, silencing the squeals of pre-teen excitement. Keatings will now miss the pommel finals on Friday. But half an hour later he was back, nailing his routine on the rings, and the O2 was united in heartfelt relief. It seems appropriate that the artistic worlds should be taking place on the Greenwich peninsula. Like the former Millennium Dome itself a great deal of effort \u2013 and money \u2013 has gone into rebranding British gymnastics for the wider public. Some time before midday the stadium MC could already be heard pleading with a three-quarter empty arena to \"join in\". \"We don't mind if you shout the name of your favourite gymnast like they're a football team!\" hinted the man with the mic. And by the end of the first session things had at least begun, tentatively, to swing, with further solid performances from Keatings securing his place in the all-round final. It was left to his coach, Paul Hall, to lament the missing pommels: \"Daniel got himself into a great position, executed his routine very well and then just came off. He was unlucky. He picked himself up and he can be proud of that.\" Between sessions we were treated to a pleasantly homemade opening ceremony. People in blue T-shirts carried the flags of the competing nations, accompanied by a portentous chamber music version of The World In Union, and Beth Tweddle read out the gymnast's oath. British gymnastics is set on an exciting trajectory. This is something we're getting better at, and rapidly. Tweddle's 2006 world championship gold was Britain's first global title. Louis Smith's pommel horse bronze in Beijing was our first individual Olympic medal since 1908. If British gymnastics is still awaiting its first real break-out star, the charismatic Smith seems the man most likely. \"Louis does deal with all the interest really well,\" his coach said, speaking before Smith's qualification session. \"He's a very cool and collected young man and he can cope with the pressure, as he showed in Beijing. It's not just Louis, though. Looking forward to London in 2012 there's Dan [Keatings], Beth [Tweddle], Kristian [Thomas] and others.\" As is often the case, a lot of this strength in depth comes down to money. UK Sport has provided British gymnastics with an improved \u00a310.3m budget in the current Olympic cycle and success has followed. Never mind the pressure to perform, this week gymnastics is hungry for more. \"This is one of the qualities of the sport,\" Atkinson said. \"You work for years. Then you have just one moment to deliver.\" It sounds like British gymnastics is having its moment right now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
