Samir Flores Soberanes, an indigenous N\u00e1huatl, was killed in his home during the early hours of Wednesday in the town of Amilcingo in Morelos state, 80 miles south of Mexico City. He was a human rights activist, producer for a community radio station and long-time opponent of the Proyecto Integral Morelos (the integral project for Morelos) \u2013 which includes the plant and pipeline. Mexican media reported that Flores had been shot twice in the head by unknown assailants. The Morelos state prosecutor, Uriel Carmona, said the murder had nothing to do with the thermal-electric plant and investigators were probing links to organised crime. The People\u2019s Front in Defence of the Land and Water for the states of Morelos, Puebla and Tlaxcala (FPDTA) said in a statement that Flores had no enemies besides those behind the project. \u201cThis is a political crime for the human rights defence that Samir and the FPDTA carried out against the [project] and for people\u2019s autonomy and self-determination,\u201d the statement said. The FPDTA has opposed the construction of the thermal-electric project at Huexca over concerns it could contaminate water supplies. The project was first proposed in 2011, but has been championed by Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, as a way to reduce electricity bills. There will be a referendum on the project in the three states this weekend. L\u00f3pez Obrador, who took office late last year, has held referendums on previous megaprojects such as a new airport for Mexico City, a refinery and railways in southern Mexico \u2013 though critics have claimed the votes were designed to induce his preferred outcomes. The president condemned Flores\u2019s murder but said the referendum would proceed as planned. Flores\u2019s violent death continued the disturbing trend of environmental and human rights defenders, along with journalists, being murdered with impunity in Mexico \u2013 something L\u00f3pez Obrador has promised to confront. The death also came after L\u00f3pez Obrador controversially branded civil society groups as conservative for opposing his plans for megaprojects and creating a militarised police force. Conservatives \u201chave seized control of civil society. I don\u2019t know people from civil society,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador, commonly called AMLO, said on Tuesday. \u201cThe truth is very few [are] left-wing. With total respect, everything to do with civil society has to do with conservatism. Even big consortiums promote civil society.\u201d Civil society organisations responded with dismay to the president\u2019s declarations, saying many non-governmental groups work on human rights and LGBTQ issues, and accompany victims of violence in the face of government indifference. Some analysts see L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s criticism of civil society \u2013 which he has also branded as fif\u00ed (snobby) \u2013 as an attempt to undercut an important counterweight in a country with a weak political opposition. \u201cCivil society implies diversity and conflict, whereas the pueblo \u2013 the people \u2013 can mean uniformity and obedience,\u201d said Carlos Bravo Regidor, a political analyst. The FPDTA responded to the president\u2019s charge of conservatism by commenting: \u201cAll those who oppose the [project] \u2026 we are for L\u00f3pez Obrador radical ultra-conservatives.\u201d \u2022 The headlines in this article were amended on 24 February 2019 to clarify that while Samir Flores Soberanes opposed the electrical plant and its related gas pipeline, the public vote is formally on whether the plant should operate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
