When she was 14, her entire family disappeared and now, following a television programme about this old unsolved mystery, she has received unsettling messages suggesting they are still alive. It's a promising scenario that develops at breakneck speed, with a plot that tightens, garrotte-like, with every twist. Cynthia's husband tracks down her old boyfriend, who admits seeing her mother and brother leave the house that night, and her father rush away shortly afterwards. Despite the complex drama becoming increasingly improbable, even ludicrous, and despite the narrator using an irritating voice for the story's many mobile calls, it's unswitchoffable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
