In an address to the National Press Club to respond to Labor\u2019s official campaign review \u2013 which blamed weak strategy, poor adaptability and an unpopular leader for the defeat in May \u2013 Albanese said Labor would continue to prioritise spending on health and education. But with the opposition likely to drop some or all of the controversial revenue-raising measures proposed under Bill Shorten, Albanese said Labor would have to work within a smaller funding envelope: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the same level of revenue, you can\u2019t have the same level of expenditure. It\u2019s just a fact.\u201d As well as digging in on climate, Albanese also gave progressive activist groups a serve for assuming that Labor had already won the election, and escalating their wishlists in a way that compounded difficulties in the campaign: \u201cI think that too many of the interest groups were concerned with influencing a future Labor government rather than getting one. \u201cThey assumed it would happen, and they took it for granted.\u201d He counselled groups like GetUp that if they were interested in getting a progressive government elected federally they should concentrate on marginal seats rather than inner-city electorates. \u201cThere are always a lot more people handing out for GetUp in my electorate of Grayndler than in Reid right next door \u2013 a seat that determines government one way or the other,\u201d he said. He also called time on the party\u2019s post-election introspection: \u201cLabor should not be fighting ourselves. We should be fighting the others. I want to lead a unified party. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a difficult time but, frankly, some of the self-reflection stops today. That\u2019s the point of the campaign review.\u201d He wanted to change party culture, moving on from the hostilities of the Rudd/Gillard era and in the process creating a platform where Labor could win government, and hold on to government for long enough to enact durable change. Despite being in politics for most of his adult life, living through the leadership battles of the Rudd/Gillard period, managing the parliament during the period of minority government, and doing two terms in opposition after losing a bid to be party leader in 2013, he still had the energy for the fight. He intended to attack the opposition leadership with \u201cvigour and energy\u201d and he challenged journalists at the National Press Club: \u201cTry and keep up with me.\u201d As part of Friday\u2019s reset, Albanese intended to change the substance of Labor\u2019s policy platform, not just the style. The party\u2019s national conference would be held next December and policies rolled out closer to the next election. He insisted Labor would continue to pursue an ambitious climate change policy and would not be \u201cdragged\u201d into a suboptimal set of responses by a government that was a long way out of step with conservatives in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. \u201cWe sometimes, I don\u2019t think in this country, see just how far off the mainstream the Abbott forces are \u2013 and you know the mob who are not just climate-change sceptics but \u2026 market sceptics as well have dragged the political debate in this country. I\u2019m not going to be dragged with it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
