His match-winning 107 in the CB40 final at Lord's on Saturday was all the evidence England's selectors needed that he is ready for a recall to the team after missing two months of the season with a broken metatarsal. Today he was called up to the squad for the two remaining one-day internationals against Pakistan. Bell himself reckoned that the innings on Saturday was the finest he has played in the limited-overs game. \"In terms of one\u2011day cricket,\" he said, \"I probably haven't played any better than that.\" It was hard to disagree. Paul Collingwood missed the third one\u2011day international on Friday because he was suffering from a virus. And while he took full part in England's training today, Bell has not just been called up to provide cover. In his current form, England will be better with him in the team. \"It's great to have him back,\" said the captain Andrew Strauss. \"I didn't see Saturday's match, but it was obviously an outstanding effort. You get a huge amount of confidence from playing that kind of innings, because there is a lot of pressure on your shoulders chasing like that.\" And that was the key to Bell's innings. There have been enough occasions in the past when he has struggled to score runs under pressure, to stoke the cynics' perception of him as a choker, but he carried Warwickshire to victory almost single-handedly. No one else in his side passed 30. The extra responsibility that came with captaining the team \u2013 \"something I have always wanted to do\" \u2013 sharpened his desire to play well. \"I was extra determined to be there at the end.\" The beaten Somerset captain, Marcus Trescothick, admitted afterwards that even though they were defending only 200, he felt his side would win \"so long as we could get Bell out\". They could not, not in time to save the game. They did not even come close, the odd troublesome delivery from Murali Kartik aside Bell, who batted 129 minutes and hit 12 fours from 95 balls, only fell when he was trying to hit the winning runs. He has already made sure of the result by crashing 20 runs from the 38th over, bowled by Mark Turner. It was the perfect example of how to pace an innings, Bell played a steady hand while wickets fell at the other end, waited patiently for the opportunity to attack, and then took full advantage. \"He showed himself to be the world\u2011class player that he is,\" Trescothick rued. \"He didn't give many opportunities for us to get him out at all.\" \"As the innings developed I didn't need to take too many risks,\" Bell said. \"It was not as aggressive as I have played this year but it was what was required in the situation.\" He has tailored his approach to one\u2011day cricket in response to a demand from the England coach Andy Flower that he increases his scoring rate. \"Previously for Warwickshire, most of the season in the CB40, I have scored over a run a ball, which is what Andy Flower wanted from me, not a strike rate of 80 but over a run a ball. \"That doesn't mean hitting the ball out of the park, but it means taking the boundaries when the field is up and playing sensibly when the field is out.\" Bell's recuperation from the injury has left him hungry for more. While his team-mates wind down at the end of the season, he insists he will be going back to the nets. \"I want to keep my form going. I feel fresh and excited about cricket with those eight weeks behind me.\" It has been more than a decade since Bell made his first-class debut, but he is only 28. \"The best years are still to come,\" he says. England will certainly hope so."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
