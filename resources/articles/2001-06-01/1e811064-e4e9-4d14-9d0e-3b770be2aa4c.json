The venue was the home of the striker Vincenzo Montella in the suburb of Casal Palocco, just south of Rome. But this was no end-of-season social soiree for players and partners. The instructions were to come alone, without wife or girlfriend. For this was a time when men had to do what men have to do. They were there to sign a \"title-winning pact\" over a plate of pasta. In the build-up to tomorrow's last dramatic act in a still uncertain Serie A championship the heat is on and Roma's last supper was just one more sign of escalating tension in a week marked by threats, accusations and insinuations. Roma are the league leaders and they go into tomorrow's fraught programme two points clear of second-placed Juventus and three points clear of third-placed Lazio. Roma are at home to Parma, Juventus host Atalanta and Lazio are away at Lecce. In theory, there should be no contest. At an Olympic stadium packed to its 75,000 capacity, Roma will face opponents who have already qualified for the Champions League. Parma's motivation will hardly have been boosted by a midweek Italian Cup final loss to Fiorentina. If Roma lose and Juventus win, then the title goes north to the \"Old Lady\". If Roma draw and Juventus win, then both will have 73 points and there will be a play-off. If both Roma and Juventus lose and Lazio win, then it will be a Roma-Lazio play-off. Lest Parma forget their duty, the Juventus president Vittorio Chiusano reminded them to \"show a professional attitude\". Parma's defender Fabio Cannavaro was also threatened on the internet, and told that if he did not \"ensure that Roma win\", then his enemies knew where he lived. Parma have also been accused of entering a pact - with relegation-battling Verona, to whom they lost 2-1 last week. Giorgio Corbelli, the joint owner of Napoli, who are also fighting against relegation, yesterday restated allegations that Verona benefited from a \"favour\" from Parma because of financial links between the two clubs' owners. Verona's president, Giambattista Pastorello, is a former employee of Calisto Tanzi, the president of Parma. Despite their bonding dinner, Roma will not be sleeping easily. For a start, unlike their northern rivals Juventus, they are not accustomed to winning titles, having lifted the scudetto only twice, in 1942 and 1983, and they have drawn four of their past six games. They also blew a chance to secure the title by conceding a late equaliser in a 2-2 draw away to Napoli last Sunday. Then there is the Montella question. Frustrated at being kept on the bench for much of the season, the striker turned on his coach Fabio Capello after the game against Napoli last week in a touchline altercation that ended with him calling Capello a \"piece of shit\". Since then, according to Capello, the pair have talked \"man to man\" and Montella had clearly recovered sufficiently to host Totti's impromptu dinner party. Capello, already a title winner with Milan and Real Madrid, knows how to handle such tense situations. \"Our table position, two points clear, is the only reality that matters; the rest is just idle chatter,\" he said. \"I don't see any psychological problems. We will play really well on Sunday.\" Serie A P W D L GD Pts Roma 33 21 9 3 33 72 Juventus 33 20 10 3 33 70 Lazio 33 21 6 6 30 69 Parma 33 16 8 9 22 56 Milan 33 12 13 8 11 49 Internazionale 33 13 9 11 -1 48 Atalanta 33 10 14 9 5 44 Fiorentina 33 10 13 10 2 43 Bologna 33 11 10 12 -3 43 Perugia 33 10 12 11 -3 42 Brescia 33 9 14 10 0 41 Udinese 33 11 5 17 -9 38 Lecce 33 7 13 13 -15 34 Reggina 33 9 7 17 -18 34 Verona 33 9 7 17 -20 34 Vicenza 33 8 9 16 -15 33 Napoli 33 7 12 14 -17 33 Bari (R) 33 5 5 23 -35 20"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
