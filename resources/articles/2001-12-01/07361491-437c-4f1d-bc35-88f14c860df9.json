Thanks to Newcastle United it got one. When Nolberto Solano ran clear in the last minute to steer the ball into the far corner to make it 3-4, it did not feel absurd to suggest that the trumpet-playing Peruvian struck a chord around the country that he can never have hoped would be heard so widely. Yet for some even that proved insufficient distraction. Afterwards we were immediately carted back to violence and Leeds United. That is where we, and Leeds, are now stuck on top of a most unpleasant bandwagon. It would be great, for football's sake, to get off it, to reclaim the game. But, even though Newcastle staged a fantastic comeback from 3-1 down after 56 minutes, the post-match debate was dominated by Mark Viduka's twin strike on Nikos Dabizas. Dabizas left on a stretcher just before the interval after Viduka had caught the Newcastle defender with an over-the-ball tackle which Bobby Robson described as \"mad and violent\". Jeff Winter showed the Australian-Croat a yellow card, a decision Robson considered dereliction of duty. Earlier, less obviously, Viduka had caught Dabizas with an arm that crushed the Greek's nose. When Viduka then twisted Newcastle's other centre-half, Andy O'Brien, inside out in the process of giving Leeds a 2-1 lead, Robson was contemplating \"a villain-to-hero story that would have made me very bitter\". David O'Leary thought Robson's an overreaction - \"Is he still harping on about it?\" - but the issue is sure to make the renewal of activities at St James' Park in less than three weeks somewhat spicy. \"A very, very bad tackle,\" said Alan Shearer in a tone of flat menace. \"Very, very nasty,\" said Dabizas, \"two inches lower and he could have shattered my leg to pieces. He had already broken my nose.\" Thus the glorious diversion was interrupted. Newcastle, it should be said, were not too displeased about that. As they filed past on the way to the bus there were plenty of smiles and handshakes but there was also a refusal to become engaged in meaningful title talk. Newcastle had just won their fourth game in a row, three of which were away from home, and the last three having been recoveries from deficit, but still the mantra was \"Leeds, Liverpool, Arsenal and Man United are all bigger and better\" - Shearer. But, understandably excited by their mini-achievement, a couple diverged slightly from the captain's hymn sheet. \"We played like league leaders today,\" said Shay Given, a short but telling insight. Robson was more expansive: \"We're not quite a brilliant team yet,\" he said, \"but we're on the verge of becoming a brilliant team. We are a talented, fit, forceful team. We have no physical incapabilities, we're winning at the end of matches. Man United will be the test, that will tell us more. I just need a bit more confirmation.\" Newcastle travel to Old Traf ford on January 2. Before that they face Middlesbrough and Chelsea at St James'. A win and a draw would leave Newcastle 10 points better off than at the same stage last season. There will be talk of reinforcements to sustain the push, though in Kieron Dyer and Gary Speed it seems the Geordies have two new signings. Speed and Dyer were at the heart of Saturday's triumph. At 32 Speed is like a man reborn this last month. It was his block tackle in the 38th minute that set Dyer on his way to creating Craig Bellamy's opener. Dyer flew past Ian Harte on the way. \"I don't know where Kieron gets his energy,\" said Shearer. The same could be said of Robson. \"I'll be 69 in February,\" said the Newcastle manager. \"I feel 50. I'm on the training pitch every day and I'll look at myself at the end of next season.\" With that he should have killed the Phillippe Troussier-arrives-in-July rumour. \"He's a World Cup player,\" said Robson, returning to Dyer. \"He'll do that for you at the highest level. In terms of England he's the man. His best position is right half but he can play anywhere.\" Robson then revealed that Dyer's stress fracture was healed only by a graft from Dyer's hip on to the shin from where the stress had literally been cut out. If only Leeds could do the same. When, within 60 seconds of Bellamy's goal, Bowyer had equalised, it seemed Leeds had done so. After Viduka had scored his marvellous goal followed by Harte's 20-yard drive, any lingering anxiety about the occasion should have been erased. Bowyer's comeback would be the story. Newly confident, however, Newcastle played their way back. O'Brien was assured in defence, Bellamy was a torment in attack. Speed and Dyer kept pumping and when Nigel Martyn could only parry a Dyer shot, Robbie Elliott's diving header made it 3-2. Eirik Bakke then handled Speed's flick in the area and Shearer whacked in the penalty. There were still 20 minutes remaining. Leeds had time to regroup but the defenders, particularly Danny Mills and Harte, could not find a colleague with the ball. Then, with seconds to go, Bellamy bravely won a 50-50 tackle with Bakke - and received a nasty kick for doing so. Dyer collected the ball and steamed on. A sliding pass inside Harte left Solano free in the area, Martyn was slow to come and offered the room in the corner that Solano found. Newcastle had their ninth goal of the week, their second 4-3 win of the season and a land of grateful admirers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
