The Scotland manager is encouraged by the possibility of being able to field the midfielders Barry Ferguson, Scott Brown and Darren Fletcher in the same team for the first time since he was appointed last January. But while Ferguson is expected to shake off a rib injury for the World Cup qualifier in Amsterdam, serious problems have emerged among Burley's defenders. The Rangers duo of Kirk Broadfoot and David Weir have already withdrawn from the Scottish squad while Stephen McManus, the Celtic captain, has no better than a 50-50 chance of playing due to a twisted right ankle. Two of the remaining three central defenders in Burley's party, Christophe Berra and Darren Barr, have a combined four caps to their name. Fielding Tottenham Hotspur's Alan Hutton against one of the most potent attacking threats in world football would be a major risk: the full-back's 70-minute reserve outing against West Bromwich Albion last night was his first action of any sort since November. \"In a bizarre way, call-offs can bring people together and unite a team even more,\" said Terry Butcher, the Scotland assistant manager, somewhat optimistically. \"There will be no hiding place on Saturday. If you want to beat the Dutch at any time you have to have the bottle to go out and play against them. \"We have to test them out, utilise the pace we have and the likes of Ferguson, Brown and Fletcher. We have legs and exciting players who want to get forward, taking the game to the opposition. These guys are used to doing that with their clubs. We are not going there to put up Hadrian's Wall and play for 0\u20130.\" Weir and Broadfoot could recover their fitness in time for Iceland's visit to Hampden Park. So too should Kris Commons, who has returned to Derby County to receive further treatment on a calf problem. The Rangers full-back Steven Whittaker has received a call-up in the meantime. Scotland trained once rather than the prearranged twice in an apparent attempt to limit the potential for further injuries. Butcher, a former England captain, recalled that he has personal experience of the kind of task Berra or Barr may face in the Amsterdam Arena. \"I played against France in the opening game of the 1982 World Cup having only had four caps,\" he said. \"I was thrown in against [Michel] Platini, [G\u00e9rard] Soler and [Jean-Fran\u00e7ois] Larios. It scares me now thinking about that, I was a rookie really. But once you get stuck into it, instinct takes over and you play your game. \"If you are overawed by reputation, in this case the likes of Robin van Persie and Dirk Kuyt, then you are sunk. Reputations should mean nothing and hopefully will mean nothing on the day.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
