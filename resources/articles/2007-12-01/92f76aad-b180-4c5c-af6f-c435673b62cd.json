My graphic designer sibling always suggests playing Pictionary at Christmas so the kids can fall about when it's my turn. So when I ring Sue Stevenson at Harrop Fold Farm about art tuition and she tells me, \"You'll definitely leave here with a painting,\" it's my turn to titter. \"Only if I nick one off her walls,\" I think. Group or one-to-one classes have been on offer since the Stevensons opened their Peak District B&amp;B (two rooms and a self-catering cottage) in 2003 and are courtesy of artist Michael Moore, who lives and works at the farm and happens to be married to Sue's author mother, Jackie. According to the website, Moore is a self-taught landscape artist who swapped photography for oils and watercolours. Let's hope he has also taught himself how to deal with the artistically challenged. I arrive at the farm, just outside Macclesfield, in the damp and dark, but the rough stone walls in my room, in a converted barn, are a cheering pale lemon. Windows at different heights are set into their reassuring thickness. Antique walnut bed, bone china by the kettle and cafetiere, cut glass for water, and an enveloping bathrobe for slobbing out. Sue bustles off to bring tea and home-made scones to a modern glass and oak dining hall linking the barn to the farmhouse. Mike Moore fetches me from breakfast the next day. I've done my best to squirrel away Cheshire Smokehouse cod with a freshly laid egg, and toast with home-made gooseberry jam before class, but it's a challenge because, naturally, I stuffed myself at dinner the previous night (canap\u00e9s, Delamere Dairy goat's cheese and dressed leaves, then lovely beef from the Stevensons' own herd). Ten minutes later, I'm at an easel in the white high-ceilinged studio, facing my worst nightmare: a blank sheet of paper. The studio is above my room, the view from the window of the same deep valley almost drained of autumn's lively hues now as winter advances. We're not painting this. Mike, long-ish haired and laid back wants me to copy him doing a different scene. That way I'll be more focused on the process. With swift pencil lines he divides his paper into sky, ground, and deftly adds a bridge. Even I can copy this. Soon I'm mixing lovely squidges of paint Mike has blobbed on to a paper plate for me (\"ideal palettes for beginners,\" he says). If only I can do justice to their regal names: prussian blue, cadmium red, burnt umber. Then, wielding a square-ended brush - \"easier to control\" - I start to mix water with paint, aiming to match the little puddles of colour on his plate. Gradually, we build up tones on our respective paintings, stroking on light shades first, dabbing dark colours with smaller brushes later. \"Colour creates perspective in painting,\" Mike explains. I'm utterly absorbed and hours go by in a flash. This is such fun. \"Stand back and take a look,\" he says. Blimey! Trees, fields, a riverbank and water flowing under the bridge are clearly identifiable. Of course the brushwork is far less practised than Mike's, but it's my brushwork and I love it. The picture is propped up on my desk now. Kishfield Bridge in Derbyshire, painted by me.
