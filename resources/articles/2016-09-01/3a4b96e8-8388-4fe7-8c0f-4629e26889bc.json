Until the S6 400m freestyle final began, that is. Ellie Simmonds\u2019s defence of her title came to an unhappyend when Yelyzaveta Mereshko won gold at a canter, while Ellie Robinson was pushed into fourth place by her older team-mate. Inspired to take up swimming after watching Simmonds in London four years ago, Robinson has been one of the breakthrough stars of these Games. The 15-year-old has the same condition as Simmonds, Achondroplasia dwarfism, and she caused a stir by winning S6 50m butterfly gold last Friday, while Simmonds made swimming history by becoming the first SM6 swimmer to race below three minutes in the 200m medley on Monday night. Robinson was in the pool with Simmonds a day later and finishing fourth to the five-time Paralympic champion\u2019s sixth in the S6 50m freestyle final was a surprise given that the youngster spent most of the race pinching herself. The stage was set for the S6 400m freestyle final on Tuesday night when Simmonds and Robinson qualified third and fourth fastest respectively after being placed in the same heat. Yet Mereshko, the world record holder, showed why she was the favourite by streaking away in 5min 17.01sec. China\u2019s Lingling Song took silver in 5min 21.37sec and Simmonds was unhappy with bronze in 5min 24.87sec. This was billed as her strongest event, the one in which she made her name in Beijing eight years ago. \u201cI had a great warm-up and then I don\u2019t know to be honest, I had been on really good form,\u201d Simmonds, who has two events left, said. \u201cIt\u2019s not good.\u201d In the end the highlight for ParalympicsGB came when Stephanie Millward won the women\u2019s S8 100m backstroke final in 1min 13.02sec. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, three Paralympic Games, 18 years of multiple sclerosis and here I am with that gold medal I\u2019ve been striving for,\u201d the 34-year-old said. \u201cI wrote a poem ages ago called MS My War about how we have to keep on striving for winning the war and I think that swim has just won that war.\u201d Millward\u2019s victory was preceded by Ollie Hynd winning silver in the men\u2019s version of the race. China\u2019s Zhou Cong won gold with a world record of 1min 2.90sec. Robinson finished fourth but she has enjoyed herself in Rio. The teenager made headlines with her nonchalant entrance before the 50m butterfly, strutting into view looking like she owned the place in her black hooded robe. \u201cI saw the reaction from it and people quite liked it, so I was like \u2018I can go with this\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cThe story behind it was I was going to wave and put my hands up and just say hi to everyone. I forgot I had a really tight suit, a jumper, a dry robe and a drawstring bag. I could only get my arms to halfway and I was like \u2019okay, we\u2019ll just deal with this\u2019.\u201d Some people never get the chance to meet their heroes. Some end up disappointed when they do. There was no chance of Simmonds letting Robinson down. They make quite the double act. They were side by side after the morning heats, explaining how confusion strikes whenever someone says their name. \u201cWe both look round, don\u2019t we?\u201d Simmonds said. Robinson replied: \u201cYes, it\u2019s like Ellie\u2019 \u2013 and it\u2019s like \u2018oh, the other one\u2019.\u201d On it went. \u201cEllie S and Ellie R,\u201d Simmonds said. \u201cPeople call me Simmondsio or El. We\u2019re just Ellie, aren\u2019t we?\u201d They certainly are."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
