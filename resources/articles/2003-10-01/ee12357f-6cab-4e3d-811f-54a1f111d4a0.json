Another US soldier died in a gunfight in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, the US military said. The attack in which the two soldiers died happened just before noon local time near Samarra, 60 miles north of the Iraqi capital. The town is part of the so-called \"Sunni Triangle\" to the north and west of Baghdad, an area in which resistance to the US-led occupation has been strongest, and which is a hotbed of support for Saddam Hussein. In Mosul, a soldier from the 101st Airborne Division was killed by small arms fire before dawn in the west of the city, US central command reported. It gave no further information about the identities of the dead soldiers. In the same city, two Iraqi children died and three adults were wounded in a grenade attack on a police station today, Iraqi police said. Also today, witnesses reported that a roadside bomb had injured several other troops in Falluja. It was the sixth attack carried out by insurgents there in the space of as many days. Today's deaths bring to 108 the number of US army personnel killed by hostile fire since the US president, George Bush, declared an official end to the conflict in May. In yet another violent incident, 13 other soldiers were last night injured in a mortar attack near Baqouba, 40 miles north-east of Baghdad, the US military said. The 13 injured soldiers, from the 4th Infantry Division, were wounded when a mortar round struck a hangar at Camp War Horse near the town, officials said. Three were seriously injured, and were evacuated for treatment. The others were treated at the local aid facility, the command said. US troops returned fire and pursued the attackers, but there was no word on any Iraqi casualties. Today's grenade attack on the Mosul police station was carried out by three assailants, one of whom was apprehended, Iraqi police said. The children, aged three and five, died when the grenade blew up at a side door of the station, which is located in a busy market street. There was no report from the US military command about the attack in Falluja, a notorious flashpoint town 40 miles west of Baghdad. However, Iraqi witnesses said that it had occurred near a bridge at the western end of the city this morning. The witnesses said that three injured US soldiers were evacuated after the area was sprayed with gunfire. After the attack, troops detained several Iraqi civilians, including one who was dragged from his vehicle and punched repeatedly in the kidney as he fell to the ground. \"Immediately after the attack, which damaged a Humvee, troops fired randomly and two helicopters hovered overhead,\" said one witness, Youssef Mohammed. \"The troops arrested five shopkeepers who were in their shops close to the location of the blast.\" It was the sixth day of attacks against US forces in Falluja since gunmen blasted a broken-down ammunition truck there on Sunday, causing no casualties but setting off a series of huge explosions. A US paratrooper from the 82nd Airborne Division was killed by a bomb the following day, and another soldier was wounded yesterday by a homemade explosive. Lieutenant Colonel George Krivo, the US command spokesman, said that attacks on coalition forces have averaged around 26 per day over the past two weeks. Around three-quarters of the attacks have taken place in an arc stretching from the west through Baghdad to the region north of the capital. The incidents came as representatives of 77 nations gathered in Spain for a two-day conference to raise money for Iraqi reconstruction. The violence has raised concern over the prospects of a quick revival of Iraq's economy, despite the country's vast oil reserves. Today's attacks also coincided with a visit to Iraq by the US deputy defence secretary, Paul Wolfowitz, a chief architect of the US \"war on terror\". Mr Wolfowitz flew into Baghdad today, aiming to help speed up the transfer of power from US-led forces to Iraqis. Visiting for the second time in three months amid growing concern about escalating attacks on foreign troops, he said that Iraqis were increasingly \"putting their lives on the line to defend their country and build a free and prosperous future\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
