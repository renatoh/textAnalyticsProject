Not for 20 years has a Calcutta Cup fixture been played in more atrocious conditions and seldom have so many travelling fans experienced so many problems getting home afterwards. For those left stranded by cancelled trains and planes, flying to Kolkata for the weekend would have involved slightly less hassle. In one case an easyJet plane which had flown from Edinburgh to Stansted was forced to abort its landing at the last moment and return to Scotland. Bemused passengers were subsequently informed their next available flight would depart on Tuesday. With flooding close to the airport having also left car rental firms unable to release most of their vehicles, only a fortunate few made it back on schedule. England\u2019s players and management were among the luckier ones, having dodged the chaos by taking a prompt flight south on Saturday night. Rugby-wise, they also managed to emerge shaken but, ultimately, not stirred. Victory has breathed fresh life into their championship prospects and amid the swirling wind and rain there were enough flickers of improvement to offset the disappointment of their chastening defeat in Paris. Further improvement will be required to win the title but two successive home games against Ireland and Wales now represent an opportunity as much as anything else. England\u2019s pack were good enough in the wet, for the most part, to neutralise Scotland, who should probably have won in Dublin. With home advantage also to be factored in, Eddie Jones will be disappointed if they fail to rise to the Irish challenge. Jones is also firmly of the opinion that games like this one are part of rugby\u2019s rich tapestry. A dry ball, firm surface and bright sunshine clearly encourages a very different kind of match but, in Jones\u2019s view, it is that in-built variety that makes the tournament unique. \u201cRugby is a winter sport so until we make it a summer sport we should be playing in winter conditions,\u201d he said, dismissing suggestions that a roof over Murrayfield might be the way forward or that southern hemisphere coaches would look down their noses at the lack of spectacle. \u201cThe players have to adapt to the conditions and find a way to win. I think it\u2019s the most intriguing rugby. To come up here and do that after we got a bit of a kick in the guts [in Paris] is one of the most satisfying wins we\u2019ve had. Everyone in the southern hemisphere appreciates how tough the competition is here. I know that from talking to other coaches.\u201d Anyone who has ever played the game at any level will instinctively know what he means: a damp, mud-spattered dressing room can be the best place in the world when you have just edged a tight, physically demanding contest alongside your mates. Casual sofa viewers who simply want sanitised rugby should get out more, according to Jones. \u201cYou get new fans by having a good product. And a good product is a game which is contestable, tough and played in a number of different ways. If you had that game every week for 12 weeks, people mightn\u2019t like it. It\u2019s a pretty simple game in those conditions. You want the opposition to have the ball. But next week the ball might be fizzing around everywhere. It\u2019s the great thing about our game that we can have different sorts of games. We don\u2019t want to take that away, otherwise it becomes like Twenty20 cricket. You know what the balance of the game is going to be all the time.\u201d Jones also has strong views on the subject of modernising the Six Nations, with reports continuing to swirl that South Africa, Japan and Fiji might one day join the championship: \u201cIt\u2019s called the greatest rugby tournament in the world and I think it is. So why would you want to add other teams that are going to decrease the level of competition? I can only talk from experience. Super Rugby was the golden egg of rugby: 12 teams, brilliant, competitive. As soon as it expanded it lost its allure. You want the best teams playing against each other. There\u2019s something about the Six Nations \u2013 because of the history of the relationships between the nations \u2013 that makes it outstanding. There is a lot of meaning to a lot of people for a game like this.\u201d The secret of rugby satisfaction, in summary, is simple: it has genuinely to matter to both the players and their audience. There should be no problem on that front for the rest of this tournament, with Jones hoping the first-hand experiences of the last two weeks has taught his side some important lessons about adapting under pressure. Gregor Townsend, for his part, will simply be hoping his captain, Stuart Hogg, has made his last costly misjudgment of the season, the full-back\u2019s failure to deal properly with a George Ford grubber kick under his own posts supplying England with the field position from which their replacement prop Ellis Genge crashed over for his match-winning 70th-minute try. With Finn Russell also having some pointed words to say about Townsend\u2019s man management, these are not the easiest of times to be a Scotland head coach. For coaches, captains and the travelling hordes of spectators alike, the Six Nations is nothing if not a proper test of character and stamina."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
