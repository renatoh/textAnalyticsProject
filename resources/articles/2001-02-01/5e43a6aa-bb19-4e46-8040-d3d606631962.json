A good, decent solid speech it was too. Carefully modest and vainglory free - \"a massive amount still to do\" is an honest and convincing core message. But what we are waiting for is not there yet - the big picture, the big idea, the vision thing. \"Radical but firmly in the centre ground\" butters not one political parsnip, cuts no hot mustard. It is a line that might have been written for Rory Bremner. Alas, the prime minister is still flapping about in his big tent, still squaring every circle, never a tough choice in his have-it-all, all-gain-and-no-pain school of politics. That is partly electioneering (Denis Healey did not win an election promising to tax people until the pips squeaked), but it is also very Blair. This is third way tactics, zig-zagging to dodge all political labels, running for touchdown before anyone pins one on him: \"There will be no dogma of the past, no ideological barriers, no hangovers from either the postwar Labour settlement or the Thatcherism of the 80s and 90s, that will stop us getting the right answers that meet our ideals and help improve the lives of the vast majority of the British people\". This is dodg'em politics. The advisers were not pleased when some of the (hostile) press predicted this speech would herald a return to old Labour ideals. Well, it does and it doesn't. Old Labour ideas permeate it - how could they not? Better schools, transport, doctors and universities with fairness and equal opportunity for all - these are bedrock Labour values. But there isn't a Tory baseline he doesn't touch down on too: \"Open more markets to competition by removing damaging regulation... We need to reform radically not just the relationship between business and government but how we encourage small business and how taxation affects the business environment\". Nowhere a mention that we already have the lowest business taxes and least business regulation of any EU country. He talks only of the responsibility of the poor to take up opportunities. There is not a word of the responsibility of the rich or of business towards the wider society. Does it matter? In the end it will. Because the Labour goods cannot be delivered by merely redistributing a lucky surplus. However, there is a changed tone from the frenetic pre-1997 days. Tony Blair sounds less craven in pandering to antithetical interests. But then what is there to be afraid of at all? Lord of all he surveys, the enemy nowhere, why the need still to placate instead of persuade? There are mighty battles to be won, not against the already vanquished Tories but to tug the hearts and minds of the voters towards a more progressive agenda. There is no doubt he would like to persuade them about Europe, about the uselessness of prison, the importance of proportional representation or the value of the public goods that can only be bought collectively, through taxation. If not now, then when? It will get no easier when a new Tory leader with a more threateningly compassionate conservatism starts to creep up on Labour halfway through the next term. Electorally, this is as good as it gets. So is this as brave as Tony Blair ever gets? Opportunity. That was the one word message of this speech. It is one of those political hardy annuals that blooms both red or blue, according to the speaker, not a word to set the world on fire. But in his peroration, Blair produced a good version of it: \"Creating a meritocratic society is not wrong: it is just insufficient. It needs to recognise talent in all its forms, not just intelligence. It needs to be coupled with a platform that recognises the equal worth of all our citizens.\" That requires \"an active government ensuring a fair playing field, investing in our people and public services to release the potential of all\". That is a good enough leftwing analysis. But how is the \"massive amount to do\" to get done without a higher share of GDP spent on more government? Tony Blair is not much of a political theorist. He likes what works in the real world and he likes what keeps a Labour government in power: he has a pretty keen political instinct for both. If you want high theory, not gut instinct, then turn to the Treasury where the chancellor thinks and talks it (endogenously) day and night. But despite his reputation as the secret keeper of the candle of old Labour's egalitarian conscience, the way his thinking now tends is even further from old Labour than Tony Blair. Like Blair, he has a passionate commitment to pulling up the poor and improving the life chances of every poor child. But after that, he increasingly looks across the Atlantic for inspiration, not to the social democracies of Europe. This is odd. For the fulfillment of Blair's \"land of opportunity\" dream would be Sweden - about as far from Texas as you can go. Like the Americans (and unlike the Europeans), he does not think that runaway super-wealth at the top makes much difference to the poor. Instead he hankers after a US dynamism he finds lacking in Europe. Like the Americans, the chancellor shudders at big government and sometimes ends up in a surprisingly similar camp to William Hague, eyeing the same US social models. All week Hague has been praising the power of the churches, faith-based charities and voluntary organisations as the best providers of welfare. It is surprising to find the chancellor also looking to these same ideas. The Atlantic-sized social differences between the UK and US are easily airbrushed. Policies President Bush will surely find unworkable are unimaginable here. Here the \"faith-based community\" is about the size of the ten-pin bowling community and the weak voluntary sector unable and profoundly unwilling to shoulder the role of the state. Encouraging and contracting them may be good social policy, but they can never be a substitute for the state. A Labour party that no longer believed that a well-run state can be a force for good would soon lose its way. The enthusiasm for PFI and PPP using the private sector wherever possible springs from the chancellor's visceral American dislike and mistrust for the state, fearing it will always run things so much worse that it is worth paying out large extra sums to avoid it. The election will be fought on tax and spend, and also on the vice or virtue of big government. What matters will be what Labour thinks and says to the voters about the future of government, its size and its potential. In an untheoretical, hands-on way Tony Blair is inclined to believe in it, with a tendency to roll up his own sleeves and steer it on every possible subject, as he did with the NHS plan. Blithely he promised to reach EU average levels of health spending. But he does not face up to needing EU levels of spending and therefore taxing to match their standards in all the public services. No, \"radical but firmly in the centre ground\" will not take us to his land of opportunity for all - which is a truly radical aspiration. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
