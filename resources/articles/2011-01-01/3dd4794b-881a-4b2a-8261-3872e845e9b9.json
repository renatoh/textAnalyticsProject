Spurs are now in talks with Beckham's club, Los Angeles Galaxy, about signing the 35-year-old on loan until the Major League Soccer season resumes in March. Redknapp even suggested that Beckham could be available to play in the FA Cup tie against Charlton Athletic next weekend, explaining that he was eager to complete the deal done as rapidly as possible. Galaxy are believed to be reluctant to sanction the move because Beckham suffered an injury during a similar loan stint at Milan last year, but the player has explained that he believes playing for Spurs would help him maintain his fitness levels during the American off-season \u2014 while also helping him fulfil his ultimate aim, which is to add to his 115 England caps. \"We've got to get him quickly if it's going to happen as he's only available until March,\" explained Redknapp. \"It's out of may hands now, I've passed it on to [Tottenham director of football administration] Darren Eales and I think he's talking to whoever he has to talk to at LA Galaxy. It's down to whether they'd let him come or not.\" Asked whether he was concerned that Beckham has previously said he would never contemplate signing for a club other than Manchester United, whom he left after a decade in 2003, Redknapp replied: \"David just said he'd like to come and play at Tottenham. He told me that.\" Redknapp rubbished the notion that Beckham no longer has anything to offer at the highest level and explained how he could fit into Tottenham's team. \"Other than Aaron [Lennon] we've got no one who can play wide on the right because David Bentley keeps picking up injuries and wants to go out on loan anyway. I've got Niko Kranjcar but he hates playing there, he wants to come in off the left so it's a problem. You need a squad. [Beckham] is not going to play every game but I still think he could play a big part for us. He could have come on [against Fulham] and help us keep the ball.\" Redknapp compared signing Beckham to his decision to bring Teddy Sheringham to Portsmouth in 2001, when the striker, like Beckham now, was 35. \"[Beckham] would be a great influence. When I took Teddy to Portsmoiuth, I said to the others 'watch him train, watch his technique and how he takes pride in everything he does. Watching how top players practice is better than all the coaching in the world. If it's doable, it's a no-brainer.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
