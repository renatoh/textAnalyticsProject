After the alarms of the tuition fees bill, when the government had to fight tooth and nail to preserve its majority by five votes, Ruth Kelly, restored as education secretary, and her new ministerial team could be forgiven for thinking that's enough higher education for the time being. Education ministers will be looking over their shoulders to please Gordon Brown and second-guess his education preferences. From what we know so far, he is keen on early years education - small John Brown will be a daily reminder - and science (which is better news for universities). Further education colleges are optimistic because of his support for educational maintenance allowances and vocational training, but the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) may well feel universities and Tony Blair's target of 50% participation are no longer top priorities. But while the issue of top-up fees didn't get much play in the media during the election campaign, it does appear to have hurt Labour on polling day in university towns. Cambridge went from Labour to Lib Dem on a 15% swing, Manchester Withington went the same way on a 17% swing, shifts that can't just be explained by Iraq. The first task for Kelly and her team in higher education is to start selling top-up fees to the public in a way that the government has singularly failed to do so far. Many students and parents still seem to imagine they will have to find \u00a33,000 before being allowed on to campus - ignorance cynically stoked by the Lib Dems and the National Union of Students. Having got top-up fees through the last parliament - only just - ministers need to work harder to explain it to the public. The smaller majority, with many of the Labour anti-fees rebels still in their seats, and an emboldened Liberal Democrat presence, means that the \u00a33,000 cap is fixed for the foreseeable future. Ian Gibson, MP for Norwich North and chair of the science and technology committee until the election, said he would \"die fighting\" any move to lift the fees cap. \"Most MPs were against top-up fees, and even more are now. I have evil thoughts in my head: rather than taking the cap up, maybe we should get rid of them [variable fees]. It's a useless policy.\" Phil Willis, the Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said: \"Labour are going to find it incredibly difficult to lift the cap on fees. I think they've got to rethink their whole policy on higher education. I think all three parties should be reconsidering their university funding policy - the Liberal Democrats included. We're going to be looking much more closely at what universities' form and function should be. We need to ask how we fund them and what they're for.\" Michael Sterling, vice-chancellor of Birmingham, who chairs the Russell group of research universities, admits: \"It's absolutely clear the cap won't be lifted.\" He adds, a trifle desperately: \"There has to be pressure to put the cap to a more sensible level. We all know \u00a33,000 was a compromise to get the legislation through. The education select committee recommended \u00a35,000 and that's the cap, we believed was viable. We still believe that. If the balance of power means there is no raising of that cap it's even more urgent that we increase government funding. [The government] assumed that the Higher Education Act sorted out universities. It hasn't.\" The parlous state of several universities and higher education colleges was demonstrated when the Guardian published details of 11 institutions (the majority thought to be HE colleges) on the \"worry list\" of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce). One institution (all names were blanked out by Hefce officials) was reported in December to have undershot its 2001 recovery plan, shown poor financial management and had a history of weak governance. One institution that had under-recruited in the past and had high drop-out rates was described as having \"very ambitious\" projections for growth in both home and overseas students. Another had no assets and its fixed costs were too high for its current student numbers, but it had produced an \"unrealistic\" business plan. A substantial minority of institutions are running accumulated deficits in the hope that fees will get them out of the red from next year, as Sir David Watson, vice-chancellor of Brighton University, and his colleague Rachel Bowden pointed out in their magisterial \"end of term report\" on Labour's record on higher education: \"And some parts of the sector may be close to meltdown.\" For all the the furious debate about funding and government promises of investment, public funding of higher education as a proportion of GDP has increased slightly to 0.8%, compared with the 1% average for developed countries, but remains behind the UK's main competitors. Since 2001, spending on schools in England has nearly doubled, while what the DfES spends on higher education has increased by 36%. Public funding of universities is only two-thirds what it was in 1989 in real terms and has yet to regain the level inherited by the Blair government in 1997. \"We are not moving at all. There is all this noise around higher education but it is not moving the business forward in the way that the government is doing for schools,\" said Watson. Because the Blair government abolished upfront fees, the Treasury must first find the fees and only several years later get them back in graduate repayments. It also subsidises European Union students before trying to get the money back via tax systems from Portugal to Estonia - an issue almost guaranteed to land on the higher education minister's desk before long. And to scramble the act through the Commons, ministers agreed to subsidise the necessary student loans so graduates will pay zero real interest. It is the cost of this measure that universities will have to live with over the next four or five years, because the interest rate subsidy comes out of the higher education budget. Another immediate consequence is that the fees and loans scheme is too expensive for ministers to extend to part-time students (about 40% of all higher education students). This has created a looming crisis not only at Birkbeck College London and the Open University (which take only part-timers) but for a number of new universities with high part-time numbers. Nobody knows quite who they are. Some are single parents battling back into the jobs market, while others are well-off executives subsidised by their companies. The high cost of student funding will also hamper progress towards the target of 50% participation in higher education. At the moment the government is not funding enough places to reach it by 2010, in the view of Hefce. Will Brown be keen on the target - it is where Scotland is already and is a key part of the government's knowledge economy policy - or recoil at the cost? On research, some universities will hope to benefit from the science and innovation strategy backed by Brown. Scientists love it - it is serious money and is a 10-year programme, so they can plan ahead. The new universities (and many of the old) will hope that the current concentration of research funding can be eased somewhat in the run-up to the 2008 research assessment exercise (RAE). It will be interesting to see whether universities are drawn increasingly into the ambit of the new Department for Productivity, Energy and Industry, where the money is, if they get decreasing amounts via the DfES. In Scotland, universities come under the Department of Enterprise and Lifelong Learning, not education, and seem to be doing rather well out of it. One can imagine it happening in England in a future Brownite reorganisation. Universities now have other masters as well: the regional development agencies, with their own pots of money and agendas. Unfortunately, as Watson and Bowden point out, although in Scotland and Wales universities are fitting into a national pattern, they do not comfortably align with the English regions. London and the south-east form a \"country\" in themselves, with 34% of home students, 44% of international students, 40% of all higher education income and 47% of research income. Relations with the regions are an immediate problem for Kelly and her colleagues as they grapple with the question of maintaining the science base around the country. Left to itself, the RAE leads to ever more concentration of scientists in fewer, larger departments but, as the Lambert report on business and the universities pointed out, this does not necessarily help companies that need local research and graduate recruits. But what universities really long for from education ministers are long-term policies like the science strategy - what Watson and Bowden compare with Galapagos tortoises - as opposed to the fleeting \"fruit fly\" experiments of which ministers are so fond. \"Institutions in the UK have become the fruit flies of evolutionary studies of higher education. They have been genetically manipulated and re-manipulated so many times that (like varieties of Drosophila) scholars and policy-makers from other countries regard them as the ideal experimental site for the study of development and heredity.\" In their report, the Turtle and the Fruit Fly, they contrast the relative stability of Labour's first term under a single education secretary, David Blunkett, with the three who have been in charge since 2001. In recent years there have been some extremely expensive fruit flies - the e-University, the NHS \"University\", and individual learning accounts, to name but three. Universities will be wishing Ruth Kelly and her colleagues a long and steady tenure and an absence of fruit-fly ideas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
