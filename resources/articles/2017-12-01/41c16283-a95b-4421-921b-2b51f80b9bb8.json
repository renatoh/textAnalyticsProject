A discussion paper released on Tuesday by the Centre for Policy Development concludes that 73% of Australians think politics is fixated on short-term gains and not on addressing long-term challenges. Only 34% thought politicians were good at making difficult decisions when representing their communities, and just 39% thought that parliaments were effective at tackling the major challenges facing their communities. The survey also paints a picture of a sceptical public. Two-thirds responded that politicians did not seem to be serving their interests, and 65% said they thought lobbyists had too much influence. The survey for the centre was undertaken by Essential in October 2017 and was based on an online panel of 1,025 respondents. It was overseen by Glenn Withers from Australian National University and sought to replicate similar polls undertaken in 1994 and 2015. Taken with the Lowy Institute\u2019s finding in April this year that only 60% of Australia\u2019s voting age population (and only 52% of 18- to 29-year-olds) believe that \u201cdemocracy is preferable to any other kind of government\u201d, the survey raises many concerns. But the good news out of the survey is that Australians are broadly in agreement on the way forward. Unlike the US where debate over \u201cdraining the swamp\u201d has deteriorated into an all-out war between President Donald Trump and institutions such as media organisations, the FBI and Congress, Australians have an appetite for democratic renewal and substantial policy reform, the survey\u2019s authors said. \u201cEvery day we\u2019re reminded our democracy is struggling under the strain of new and old challenges,\u201d said the centre\u2019s chief executive, Travers McLeod. \u201cThe arduous and painful path to marriage equality despite broad public support is one example. The rolling crisis over the citizenship status of parliamentarians is another. \u201cAnd this isn\u2019t a temporary blip. For too many years we\u2019ve been treading water while the big challenges of our time \u2013 climate change, inequality, the future of work, sustainable growth, and Australia\u2019s place in the region \u2013 have gathered steam. We need better answers, and we don\u2019t have any more time to lose.\u201d Last month the former head of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet Terry Moran, who chairs the centre, gave a speech to senior public servants describing the state of policy advice in Canberra as being \u201cin palliative care\u201d. He also criticised a policy direction he had helped implement for the Rudd-Gillard governments \u2013 contracting out to the private sector the delivery of social services such as job search. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear from CPD\u2019s research,\u201d said Moran \u201cis that Australians think reinvigorating our democracy is a pressing and overdue task. This is about improving the way the system works and ensuring that the best contemporary policy ideas rise to the top.\u201d The report offers some clear signposts to both fixing the system and policy directions. It showed Australians strongly back reforms such as a federal anti-corruption commission (77%), a tougher code of conduct for MPs (79%), putting citizens on parliamentary committees (68%), fixed four-year parliamentary terms (58%), and giving public agencies more independence (55%). Unlike Americans, Australians want an active government that boosts equality and protects the most vulnerable, the survey found. Despite the constant talk of tax cuts, the survey found a majority \u2013 61% \u2013 were willing to pay more tax in return for better services and improved infrastructure and are highly sceptical of outsourced human services. The report also drew on a focus group of 30 eminent Australians who assembled in Melbourne last month to discuss the challenges to democracy. \u201cThe importance of genuine citizen engagement in democracy and the policy making process was emphasised by the roundtable participants as one example of the paradox of Australia\u2019s democracy [and parliamentarians] listening but not hearing,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe postal survey for marriage equality provided ample evidence that Australians haven\u2019t switched off,\u201d the authors said. This week the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, warned against a repetition of the postal vote exercise as a way of devising policy. But the authors say people are interested in citizen engagement in the process, though probably by more modern forms of communication than the post. \u201cThere is a huge appetite for greater citizen involvement in policymaking whether it be through citizen juries or allowing citizens to serve on parliamentary committees, alongside politicians,\u201d the paper said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
