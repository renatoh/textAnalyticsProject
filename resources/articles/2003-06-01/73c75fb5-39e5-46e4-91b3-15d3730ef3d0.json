Charles Clarke, the Education Secretary, and Schools Standards Minister David Miliband will be among those summoned to explain their role in the crisis. Findings from the investigation will be geared to ensuring there can be no repeat of the funding row which is likely to leave hundreds of teachers redundant. Officials from the Audit Commission are formulating an inquiry that will examine the flow of money and decisions from Whitehall down to local authority staff. Ministers are smarting over a chain of events that has raised questions over their commitment to education despite increasing school funding by \u00a32.7 billion. Yet new calculations by the Local Government Association (LGA) claim the funding increase in reality actually amounts to just \u00a3250 million - the equivalent of \u00a310,000 a school. The inquiry will place further pressure on the rapidly deteriorating relationships between local government and Whitehall. Local authority officials have already accused the Department for Education and Skills of blunders over the handling of this year's budget. In turn, Whitehall has laid the blame at the door of the local education authorities, claiming they have failed to pass on the money to schools. Government officials have even threatened to take responsibility for education funding away from town halls altogether. A DfES spokesman insisted yesterday the crisis was a 'one-off', while conceding there had been problems. 'The strong pressure of costs combined with particular issues for individual local education authorities has made the situation difficult for individual schools.' The continuing crisis follows the passing of last Friday's deadline for headteachers to dismiss staff. Surveys suggest almost 1,500 teachers and support staff may have been issued with redundancy notices because of the budget crisis. Criticism of the Government's handling of the education funding row will continue this week at the LGA's annual education conference. Sir Jeremy Beecham, chair of the LGA, warned of the potential for a repeat of the funding shortfall next year. Unless radical changes are made to the funding system a repeat of the chaos would almost certainly happen again, he said. 'The education service needs to be tailored to local needs and run by local people accountable to local people and supported by the Government. That is the only way to get flexibility and money where it is needed.' In a direct attack aimed at Clarke, who will be speaking at the conference, Beecham warned that direct funding would rupture relationships to the point of 'real violence' across the entire structure of local government. 'It will sour the relationship and make it much more difficult to build relationships between schools and other services,' he said. Instead he would prefer a local funding formula that could quickly respond to the specific needs of individual schools alongside a scheme to minimise the amount a school's funding can fall. So far Ministers have pledged extra money next year, but Clarke is thought to have ruled out the possibility of an extra funds this year. His threats come amid a rise in staff-room militancy. Britain's biggest teachers union, the NUT, is demanding other unions join it in taking industrial action if teachers lose their jobs. Yesterday the LGA blamed the crisis on a combination of insufficient funds, changes to the funding formula and 'inadequate' communication between central and local government. www.observer.co.uk/education"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
