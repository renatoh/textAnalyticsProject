The Premiership is already being billed as the League of One. But Ars\u00e8ne Wenger wants the best of all possible worlds for Arsenal: to be admired and loved. The Frenchman wants the legacy of his English management to be the greatest team in Arsenal's history. Many observers at the Valley would say he has already produced it. Alan Curbishley spoke in terms of Arsenal setting new English levels; his Charlton side had just played against \"something different\". The minds are already being won. The best of Arsenal has not been seen on foreign fields, however, and it became clear, as Wenger considered the latest Champions League campaign, where his heart's desire lies. This trophy would add elusive and magnificent substance to his record. Yet even here, reaching the summit of Europe, he raised the bar. For there is the small matter of style. Wenger's desire is to see his team playing \"perfect football\" and his European role models, clubs he has loved watching, were \"Ajax and Real Madrid, teams who play positive football. We want to show we are as good and I'm confident we can.\" He did not go so far as to specify a time span, reminding everyone that, in Borussia Dort mund tomorrow night, Arsenal were playing \"a big team\". England's own champions merit that description in every sense. Patrick Vieira bestrode the midfield, ultimately a French-Brazilian axis, with a towering performance that justified Wenger's faith in his captain's fitness. If Vieira is \"cooked\", then how good will he be when he declares himself fresh? \"Tired like that,\" said Wenger knowingly, \"I'll love him the whole year.\" Wenger has already spoken of a power shift from Old Trafford to Highbury but he was not rubbing in the point here after Manchester United's dismal week. \"United will be up there, don't worry about that,\" he warned. But he clearly believes the championship is Arsenal's to lose. \"We know we can win the league. We know we can be stronger. At this stage last season we were not as good as we are now.\" If there were Arsenal prizes for unselfishness - \"a sign of a great team,\" according to Wenger - there were several contenders here. All three goals defined teamwork, the pick being Vieira's lay-off for Sylvain Wiltord after the captain ran from inside his own half to find a good scoring position himself. Edu's original pass, slid as if along an invisible tape measure, was a prize-winner in itself. Confronted by such precision, pace and self-belief, Charlton were eventually goaded almost beyond endurance. Edu's header two minutes from time might have been seen as the coup de grace; in reality it had been supplied just before the interval when Thierry Henry, accepting Dennis Bergkamp's thoughtful pull-back, made a difficult chance look simple with his first time shot from the edge of the area. Henry's goal saw Arsenal score for the 45th league game running and set a record in top-flight English football. Yet their fans restrained themselves until Wiltord's obligatory strike before sending up ironic chants of \"boring, boring Arsenal\". They will enjoy themselves even more next month if Arsenal stay undefeated in their next three league games and surpass the Premiership's best unbeaten run, 29, completed in October 1999 - set by United. Charlton have lost their first three home games and United are the next visitors. Charlton started well here but missed chances by Claus Jensen and Jonatan Johansson ensured their fate. Curbishley praised his conquerors generously. After the reigns of Liverpool and United, he said, \"maybe you will be talking about the Arsenal of the 2000s. For that to happen you have to dominate for five to six years. He [Wenger] has set it up and clearly thinks he's got a chance to do that.\" Curbishley appeared to be talking in the context of England. Can Arsenal conquer Europe this season? \"We'll have to wait and see.\" Man of the match: Patrick Vieira (Arsenal)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
