Since 1901, it has shown modern artists from Barbara Hepworth to Nan Goldin, Jackson Pollock and David Hockney. Famously, the Whitechapel is the only British space to have exhibited Picasso's Guernica, and it continues to champion challenging contemporary artists. It recently expanded into the Passmore Edwards library next door, which has a year-round free exhibition to tempt even more heads to peek through the doors. Once you've eaten up all the delights inside, pop around the corner and wander up Brick Lane to Story Deli for pizza served on driftwood slabs and street-side hipster-watching. \u2022 77-82 Whitechapel High Street E1, +44 (0)20-7522 7888, whitechapelgallery.org, open Tues-Sun 11am-6pm, Thurs 11am-9pm Banner Repeater Need to kill time while waiting for a train? Search out Banner Repeater on platform one of Hackney Downs station and be bored no more. This innovative rush-hour haven should spawn a slew of art spaces in unexpected everyday environs. It's an intimate gallery with a library trolley outside and a reading room attached, but it instantly breaks down the barrier that can make wandering into an official art gallery daunting. Banner Repeater is artist-run by Ami Clarke with support from Hackney council's Empty Shops Fund. \u2022 Hackney Downs Station, Dalston Lane E8, bannerrepeater.org, open Tues-Thurs 8-11am, 4-7pm, Fri 8am-6pm, Sat, Sun noon-6pm Hannah Barry The inimitable Hannah Barry gallery is surreptitiously tucked upstairs in an 18th-century corner building on the swish shopping promenade of New Bond Street. Once you've survived the tiny, clanking lift and shuffled across the fusty landing, the door opens into a luminous showroom that is bringing emerging artists to the central London masses. Visionary Hannah Barry first opened a Peckham gallery in a disused grain warehouse before launching this second space in 2010. Bold Tendencies, the annual sculpture show she founded in the dizzying disused heights of a south London car park, is now in its fifth year. The summertime show coexists with Frank's Caf\u00e9 and Campari Bar, and is universally acclaimed for the art, architecture \u2026 and those views. \u2022 110 New Bond Street W1 (entrance on Brook Street), + 44 (0)20-7493 4224, hannahbarry.com, open Tues-Sat 10am-6pm Freud Museum While the main draw here is the pristinely preserved study, couch and all, this vast Hampstead house, where Freud and family lived after they escaped Austria in 1938, doubles as an art space. Exhibits take Freud's work, and the world's most notorious sofa, as a starting point. Artists that have interpreted Freudian terms \u2013 from the pleasure principle to free association \u2013 include Sarah Lucas, Susan Hiller and Sophie Calle. You can also gaze upon a Dali portrait of an ailing Freud that he didn't live to see, and Freud's own fine art and archaeology collection, not to mention irresistible morsels of the Freud clan's home videos. \u2022 20 Maresfield Gardens NW3, +44 (0)20-7435 2002, freud.org.uk, open Wed-Sun noon-6pm, adults \u00a36, concessions \u00a33-\u00a34.50, under-12s free Kate Macgarry Head through the bottle-green industrial front doors on notoriously arty Vyner Street and up a sloping walkway and you will emerge in this classic white cube gallery. There is a relaxed feel about the place \u2013 the exhibitions continue into the curious glass-roofed office, where you can poke your head in and peruse the art while staff are hard at work. Kate Macgarry is on the international scene, presenting work by established artists including Peter McDonald, Francis Upritchard, Goshka Macuga and Marcus Coates. This part of Bethnal Green is a hub for great spaces \u2013 while you're here, try the newly opened Motel de Nowhere on Hollybush Gardens and Image Music Text on Cambridge Heath Road. \u2022 7a Vyner Street E2, +44 (0)20-8981 9100, katemacgarry.com, open Weds-Sun noon-6pm Museum of Brands The Museum of Brands is a product placement time tunnel that snakes from decade to decade, stuffed with everything consumers have filled shopping baskets with since Victorian times. Walls are stacked like supermarket shelves, with the first ever Dairy Milk wrappers, original Marmite jars and 1930s Mars and KitKat bars. The cafe has a looping video showing a history of TV ads since 1955, when they first appeared (look out for Joan Collins getting doused by drinks in the name of Cinzano). Director Robert Opie had a revelation 46 years ago that if he tossed packaging out no one could marvel, retrospectively, at the design hours that went into it. He's been hoarding ever since. \u2022 2 Colville Mews, Lonsdale Road W11, +44 (0)20-7908 0880, museumofbrands.com, open Tues-Sat 10am-6pm, Sun 11am-5pm, adults \u00a36.50, concessions \u00a34, children 7-16 \u00a32.25, family \u00a315 Parasol Unit Next door to Victoria Miro, one of London's leading commercial galleries, is Parasol Unit, its not-for-profit neighbour. Parasol Unit is housed in a classic old warehouse building that appears run-of-the-mill until you crane upwards and spot the architecturally curious grey-and-glass shoebox perched on top. The interior has impressive minimal design and never mundane multidisciplinary exhibitions. Take in the shows \u2013 four a year since 2004 \u2013 that spread out in vast rooms over two stories, or peer out of the floor-to-ceiling back windows into the bamboo-heavy courtyard. Parasol also runs an alfresco art scheme called Parasol Public \u2013 one to watch. \u2022 14 Wharf Road N1, +44 (0)20-7490 7373, parasol-unit.org, open Tues-Sat 10am-6pm, Sun noon-5pm, first Thurs of the month 10am-9pm The Wapping Project A post-industrial art-and-dining space in a former Wapping hydraulic power station, built in 1890 to convert Thames water into power for the docks. The Boiler and Filter House galleries have innovative site-specific exhibitions, such as the Yohji Yamamoto show where visitors can rent a rowing boat and paddle out to examine a dress hung in the centre of a makeshift lake. Next door in Wapping Food, the stark brick walls and now-silent mint-green machinery contrast with the modern, seasonal food (definitely book in for brunch). The owners opened a second space in 2009: Wapping Project Bankside, a round yellow warehouse opposite Tate Britain, which concentrates on photography and film. \u2022 Wapping Wall E1, +44 (0)20-7680 2080, thewappingproject.com 176 Anita Zabludowicz is one of Britain's leading philanthropists; a contemporary collector; and a global power-patron. She runs three galleries, in the US, Finland and this Corinthian-columned Methodist chapel space that opened in 2007. It's a dynamic place that shows off not just her vast personal collection, but her curatorial nous. There's a programme of residencies and exciting exhibitions, and176 also has weekly \u00a35 life classes for the public, and free performances, talks and festivals. In 2011, The Shape We're In group exhibition sees newly commissioned sculpture take over empty shops throughout Camden. \u2022 176 Prince of Wales Road NW5, +44 (0)20-7428 8940, zabludowiczcollection.com/london, open Thurs-Sun 12-6pm The Crypt This is an old coffin repository, and there are reminders of its former use everywhere: gravestones propped against walls, a coffin slot and the bones of 557 people underfoot. A faded red sign on the thrum of Euston Road points you in the right direction, but when you head around the moss-entrenched church walls towards the vaults, there's only an \"uneven surfaces\" sign to signal your arrival. Through the ornate red iron doors and down stairs, you are welcomed into a space full of eerie alcoves, and nooks and crannies that artists use for installations and innovative group shows. The crypt was also an air raid shelter, and it has an old operating theatre, still half-daubed in surgical green to display the blood of bygone days. \u2022 St Pancras Church, Euston Road NW1, +44 (0)20-7388 1461, cryptgallery.org.uk \u2022 Kate Abbott is a commissioning arts editor for the Guardian \u2022 This article was amended on 9 May 2011.
