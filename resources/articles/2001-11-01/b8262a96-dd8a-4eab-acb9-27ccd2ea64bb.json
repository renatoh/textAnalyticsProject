It was just like old times, with Graeme Souness and Phil Thompson barking orders, a team in red apparently content pinging passes in possession and the Premiership's pinnacle scaled. Yet a closer scrutiny provided a dose of reality. The visitors may have led at the interval, faced as they were by cautious if committed opponents, but like the match itself, they promised so much more than they delivered. Even the tete-a-tete between Souness and Thompson, which had been expected to light up the Pennines, was doused by a pre-match handshake. After that, a meek share of the spoils was inevitable. \"Patience, patience,\" smiled Souness, whose side remain unbeaten at home and might have gleaned more from the game's only spell of incisive enterprise, a 15-minute period after half-time, than Matt Jansen's smartly taken equaliser. \"It was a battle of players, not managers. The Liverpool side in which I played used to keep possession much further up the pitch than they do, but that first half summed it up. They had one chance and they took it. That's football at the top level nowadays. \"We're the new boys in this league and we were playing against a team who won three trophies last season and whose results in Europe and in the Premiership have been outstanding. They could win this league. They are very difficult to play against, they'll always score goals and they work bloody hard.\" His own side mimicked that last quality in abundance. By swamping midfield to the constant holler of \"just get behind the ball\" from the bench, Rovers denied Michael Owen space in which to charge and Robbie Fowler time in which to conjure. The visitors banked plenty of possession, just like the great Reds sides of old, but the ball zigzagged across the pitch with little penetrative purpose. So much for entertainment. Then, out of nothing and within seconds of Jansen forcing Jerzy Dudek to save the first shot of the match, Rovers switched off and Liverpool scored. Steven Gerrard's hopeful cross into the area was met by Owen, leaping high above Henning Berg to thump his header into the bottom corner. \"He had no right to win that ball,\" said Jansen. \"To get the direction and power on the ball under such pressure shows what a class player he is. \"Owen is the key to them winning the league. He needs only the slightest sight of goal to score. I fancy Liverpool to win the championship. They work very hard when they've not got the ball and don't have to throw men forward because they've got Owen up front.\" It took only a slight tactical switch at half-time for Blackburn to reply. With David Dunn reverting to the left and Damien Duff given licence to roam, the outstanding Tugay Kerimoglu's shot squirmed into the area, was gathered by Jansen and the England hopeful slammed in an equaliser. Yet a return to parity did not lure Rovers from the cagey to the gung-ho. They survived a few anxious moments - Robbie Fowler crumpling to the turf under John Curtis's challenge and Danny Murphy lobbing wide in stoppage time - and their point justified their prudence. \"Generally we go at teams and attack them here, but we were never going to chase it against Liverpool,\" said Souness. \"You can't step out against them, so it was cat and mouse. It may not have been a great game to watch, but we got it right tactically.\" And politically. The feud between the former team-mates was left to simmer in the background, kept under a lid of professionalism rather than reconciliation. \"I have nothing to regret,\" said Thompson. \"What have I done?\" \"Maybe Phil regrets certain things in his life,\" added Souness. \"I certainly do. Things went on between us that I was extremely unhappy about - that's why I sacked him [as reserve-team manager] - but we had some glorious times at Liverpool and there was no one sadder than me to see it end like it did.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
