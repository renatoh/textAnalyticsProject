But let us have peace,\u201d Shipley said in brief remarks. William Murphy Jr, the Gray family lawyer, said the charges against the six officers marked \u201ca momentous step on the road to justice for Freddie\u201d. \u201cWe were in shock,\u201d Murphy said of the moment the family learned that charges had been filed against the six officers. They missed the state attorney\u2019s press conference as they were not told in advance, he said, and the family watched a recording later on television news. \u201cFreddie was taken too early and too horrifically. The worst of the Gray\u2019s family days in the history of this family have been the last three weeks,\u201d Murphy said, thanking the 35-year-old state\u2019s attorney Marilyn Mosby. \u201cWhile the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office did its work, the community and other communities like it all over the country have much work to do of their own,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cThe blue wall of silence that makes policemen wrongfully conspire to conceal evil must come down,\u201d he added. The six officers surrendered themselves on Friday afternoon at the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center downtown, where they were processed and appeared before a commissioner of the Maryland district court. Court records show that five of the six had their bail set at $350,000. The driver of the police van, officer Caesar Goodson Jr, who is African American, faces the most severe charge of second-degree murder. . Officer William Porter and sergeant Alicia D White were charged with manslaughter, assault and misconduct. They are also black. Lieutenant Brian Rice, officer Garrett Miller and officer Edward Nero were charged with manslaughter, assault, misconduct and false imprisonment. A handful of people gathered at Central Booking to catch a glimpse of the officers who were to be put through the same booking process as the scores of protesters who were arrested throughout the past week. As the crowd waited for several hours, they were joined later in the afternoon by Sybrina Fulton, the mother of deceased Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. Fulton was joined by Jamal Bryant, a local Baltimore minister with the Empowerment Temple, and several members of the local clergy, including Christian ministers and several imams. \u201cWhile we are celebrating the fact that the police officers have been arrested, we have to keep in mind that that is not a conviction,\u201d Fulton said. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, for some reason, this is open season on young African American men. I want to know, when is the season gonna be over?\u201d In west Baltimore, at the West North and Pennsylvania Avenue intersection, hundreds of people gathered to celebrate the announcement. Cars beeped their horns, preachers sang from loudspeakers and a school bus drove by with cheering children on board. The location has become a focal point for much of the protests over Gray\u2019s death and is the location of the CVS pharmacy that was burned and looted on Monday. Despite a large contingent of law enforcement officials, including members of the national guard who arrived in Baltimore after a state of emergency was declared during the rioting, police kept their distance. Captain Douglas of Baltimore police, a black officer who has been present at many of the protests over the past two weeks, told the Guardian that the citywide curfew of 10pm would be enforced. He added, however, that police would be employing \u201csoft touch\u201d tactics. Mike McMcCullough, a 55-year-old Baltimore county resident who has been seen at a number of protests over the past week, said he was shocked at the speed with which the charges were announced. \u201cIn my 55 years, I never thought I\u2019d see a black president or a police officer indicted for murder,\u201d McCullough said. \u201cThank God for social media. White folks always pooh-poohed whatever we were saying. But now we can tape it. Now we\u2019ve got proof.\u201d Many others in the crowd shared Murphy\u2019s sentiment that the charges were the first step in attaining justice in the case."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
