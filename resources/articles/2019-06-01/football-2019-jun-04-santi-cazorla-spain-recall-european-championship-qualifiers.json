Now he is in the squad that travels to the Faroe Islands for Friday\u2019s European Championship qualifier and faces Sweden at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u on Monday. Although his story is an extraordinary, inspirational one, he is there on merit alone. Cazorla has not been in the Spain team since they defeated England 2-0 in Alicante in November 2015. He scored the second goal that night and was due to travel to Wembley the following November but he struggled with knee and ankle injuries going back to 2013 and subsequently went two years without playing, suffering an infection in his heel that ate away 10cm of his tendon, left his bone \u201clike plasticine\u201d and threatened to finish his career and see him lose his leg. He underwent 10 operations, leaving him with a bit of his forearm grafted on to his right ankle, a piece of thigh in its place, part of his calf in his heel, and rolled up hamstring replacing the rotten achilles. He was told to settle for being able to walk around the garden, and was released by Arsenal. His last game had been against Ludogorets in October 2016. This summer, though, Villarreal gave him an opportunity to continue his rehabilitation. During pre-season he played for the first time in 636 days and was then offered a contract. Now, after a campaign in which he played 46 times, making 30 starts in the league, he is back with Spain \u2013 11 years and 77 caps after his debut. At Spain\u2019s Las Rozas HQ, Cazorla was asked whether he could have imagined this two years ago. \u201cUnthinkable,\u201d he said. \u201cPlaying a single game at a top level was a very long way off so imagine [playing for] the national team. This was difficult for me to take in: it\u2019s unexpected after everything. Now I take it as a new challenge, a new hope. \u201cI\u2019m here for purely sporting reasons. They said that to me: it\u2019s what you bring,\u201d Cazorla continued. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s more special in my case, because of the injury, but that\u2019s not the reason I\u2019m here although it could be an example for players my age: don\u2019t give up. \u201cThere have been all sorts of moments, times you consider throwing in the towel, but I knew it was a long run and if I didn\u2019t make it, I didn\u2019t want to blame myself or think I could have done more. There were [negative] things said to me that I didn\u2019t treat as important: I took this on with optimism, tried to leave the bad things behind, and I\u2019ve had my reward. \u201cI always felt the support of everyone from Arsenal: if there\u2019s something I\u2019ve taken away from there above all else, it\u2019s the fans\u2019 affection. The thorn in my side, the regret, is not having been able to say goodbye on the pitch, the way I\u2019d have liked.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
