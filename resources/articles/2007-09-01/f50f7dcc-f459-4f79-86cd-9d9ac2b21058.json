The London School of Economics and Political Science launched a podcast channel for its public lectures and events in January in order to advance and disseminate knowledge more widely. Anyone interested in the social sciences can hear the eminent speakers that LSE attracts talk on wide-ranging issues via our podcasts at www.lse.ac.uk/podcasts-publicLectures. LSE's podcasts have enjoyed a steady rise in visitors and downloads since they were launched and we are expecting this to continue as new podcasts are added. Catherine Bellamy Corporate web editor, LSE I was surprised by the tone of your report (Overseas fees bail out colleges, September 13). Higher education is a truly global activity. Success for our universities in recruiting international students and international academics is a matter of satisfaction, not of concern. But it is certainly important to build up levels of scientific education in the UK workforce. Over the next three years we are spending an additional \u00a375m to support provision of key science subjects in English universities. It should also be noted that the UK's research base is strong and through the 10-year science and innovation investment framework the government is committed to encouraging more people to take up research careers.
