The Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Gina McCarthy, announced that the new standard for smog levels in the US will be 70 parts per billion (ppb), tightening the rules from the previous limit of 75 ppb agreed in 2008 by the previous Republican government. The new rules to be imposed under the Clean Air Act seek to reduce asthma, especially childhood asthma, and other respiratory diseases and premature deaths that can be caused or exacerbated by smog, otherwise known as ground-level ozone pollution. \u201cThe days are gone when cities like Los Angeles were so smoggy people could not see across the street, but ozone pollution is still making people sick and we still have a lot of work to do,\u201d McCarthy said during a press conference on Thursday afternoon. \u201cThe 2008 standards are not adequate to protect public health and need to be revised,\u201d she added. Smog is the general term for low-level pollution that forms when emissions from power plants, other industry and vehicle exhaust mix, particularly on hot, still days. The Obama administration had intended to tighten the rules in 2011 following Obama\u2019s campaign promise, but succumbed to political pressure to delay the measure. The new restriction falls at the top end of a range suggested by the government in November 2014. Court action by environmental groups imposed a deadline to determine the new limit \u2013 which expired on Thursday, spurring the EPA announcement. But even as the EPA fleshed out the new rules, it was setting up Obama for an expected fresh round of confrontation with congressional Republicans already up in arms about the administration\u2019s crackdown on power plant emissions. The EPA\u2019s own scientific advisory panel recommended a smog limit between 60 and 70 ppb in 2008. McCarthy said that she had consulted 1,000 new scientific studies since that time, which showed that 72 ppb was \u201cthe lowest ozone exposure that protects against adverse effects on the health of active adults\u201d, leading her to decide on 70 ppb. The new levels must be achieved across the US by 2025. She pointed out that smog pollution has been cut by 70% since 1970 \u201cwhile GDP tripled\u201d and that the cost of meeting the new standards would be outweighed by the savings in health costs. But the new limit has been received with frustration by some on both sides of the debate. \u201cThe level chosen of 70 parts per billion simply does not reflect what the science shows is necessary to truly protect public health,\u201d said Harold Wimmer, president and chief executive of the American Lung Association, which had been pushing for 60 ppb. But the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and other business groups that have lobbied the White House in recent months and spent millions on a TV ad campaign have decried tighter limits, claiming it will cost jobs and is an overreach by the federal government. \u201cWe know that this regulation could have been worse, but it still feels like a punch in the gut,\u201d said Tom Riordan, chief executive of iron-casting company Neenah Enterprises and an NAM member. \u201cManufacturers are tough and resilient, but when Washington puts politics above job creation, we still pay a price,\u201d he said. But the EPA\u2019s McCarthy warned that 40 million Americans still lived in cities that do not meet the current smog standards of 75 ppb. \u201cWhen you look at the challenge of meeting 70 ppb, it takes a lot of time and there is plenty of time now for states to work with us on this issue,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
