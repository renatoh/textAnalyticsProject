That might be a big task if Richarlison, who cost Everton \u00a335m to acquire from Watford, has to keep playing in wide positions rather than as a central striker, though Silva feels he has plenty of goals still to come. \u201cHe has seven already, which is not a bad number when you consider he missed two games through suspension,\u201d the Everton manager said. \u201cI am happy with him but I still think he can do better in terms of goals, he certainly has the quality.\u201d Richarlison\u2019s latest goal, against Newcastle, only restored parity as Everton dropped another couple of points at home, but Silva is unconcerned over his side scoring only twice in their last four matches. \u201cYou have to take into account that two of those matches were at Chelsea and Liverpool,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cThey are not easy places for any team to score goals, yet at both Stamford Bridge and Anfield we created chances. \u201cI agree we should probably take more of our chances, we created enough in the first half against Newcastle to have won the game, but points in the Premier League are not always easy to come by. Every game brings its own challenge, and the main thing is to keep working and believing. I look at my friend Nuno at Wolves, whose team lost five times but came back to beat Chelsea.\u201d Silva knows Watford well \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s true, but they know me very well also\u201d \u2013 and was not surprised by their robust start to the season. \u201cThey have some good attacking players who can create problems. We are expecting a tough game but it is not different because it is Watford, it is just another home game it is important to try and win. What happened in the past is history now. \u201cThis will not be the first time I will face a former club and unfortunately I doubt it will be the last. That is bound to happen over time when you are trying to build a managerial career. It is not important now to talk about how my time at Watford ended. Things have moved on but I have big respect for every club I have worked for.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
