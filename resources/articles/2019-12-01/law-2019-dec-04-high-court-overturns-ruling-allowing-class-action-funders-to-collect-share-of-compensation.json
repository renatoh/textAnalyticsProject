The ruling means that funders will now have to return to the previous practice of getting individual permission from each person or company participating in a class action in order to get paid. In a decision split five to two, the full bench of the high court overturned a 2016 decision called Money Max that opened the way to what are called \u201ccommon fund orders\u201d, which drag everybody who stands to benefit from a lawsuit into a funding agreement even if they do not sign up to it. Three of the judges, chief justice Susan Kiefel and judges Virginia Bell and Patrick Keane, also mounted an unusually strong attack on a panel of federal court judges, accusing them of stating the law inaccurately and setting up a straw man argument in a decision dealing with the issue. Employer body AI Group, which has been campaigning against class actions, welcomed the decision. But its chief executive, Innes Willox, said that because the decision was split, \u201cthis suggests that a degree of legislative uncertainty remains in this area\u201d. \u201cThis highlights the need for reforms which would give greater protection to class action members against litigation funding arrangements that deliver huge windfall payments to largely unregulated, foreign litigation funders,\u201d he said. Shares in Australia\u2019s largest listed litigation funder, IMF Bentham, fell almost 3.3% on the news, dropping to $3.675 at about 2.30pm on Wednesday. However, IMF\u2019s chief investment officer, Tania Sulan, said the company welcomed \u201cthe certainty that the decision has delivered\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have a positive impact on our business,\u201d she said. This was because before the Money Max decision IMF funded cases by signing all class members up to an agreement \u201cand that was a model that worked well for us and it worked well for the clients\u201d. The high court was hearing appeals against the common fund order brought by BMW, which is fighting a class action over allegedly unsafe airbags, and Westpac, which is fighting a class action over allegedly dodgy insurance. In their joint judgment, Kiefel, Bell and Keane said that a full court of the federal court, made up of federal court chief justice James Allsop, John Middleton and Alan Robertson, paraphrased law regarding the court\u2019s powers in a way that was \u201cinaccurate in a significant respect\u201d by leaving out clauses limiting those powers. \u201cThat was, with respect, to set up a straw man and then proceed to demolish it,\u201d they said. They said the law recognised that sometimes it might be too expensive or difficult to gather the names of potential class action members through a \u201cbook-building\u201d process, making a potential lawsuit uneconomic. \u201cIf that is the case, the solution contemplated by the legislation is to halt the representative proceeding, not to make a CFO because the process of book building is proving too expensive or too difficult,\u201d they said. Dissenting, Stephen Gageler said he agreed with the full court\u2019s arguments and dismissed out of hand constitutional objections raised by BMW and Westpac. \u201cThe constitutional objections raised by the appellants do not withstand scrutiny and do not warrant elaborate responses,\u201d he said. Judges Geoffrey Nettle and Michelle Gordon agreed with the majority ruling while James Edelman opposed it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
