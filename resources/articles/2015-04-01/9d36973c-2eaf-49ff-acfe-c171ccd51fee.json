It said readings from Wednesday put the state\u2019s level of water content at just 5% of the historical average for the date. \u201cToday\u2019s survey underscores the severity of California\u2019s drought,\u201d said DWR director Mark Cowin. \u201cWater conservation must become a way of life during the worst drought in most Californians\u2019 lifetimes.\u201d Brown on Wednesday ordered the State Water Resources Control Board to reduce statewide water use by 25%. The action \u2013 the first time ever state officials have imposed mandatory water restrictions \u2013 is expected to save 1.5m acre-feet of water by the year\u2019s end. Experts say a massive response is needed to confront California\u2019s punishing dry spell, now languishing into a fourth year and exacerbated by scorching temperatures. Saying \u201ca distinct possibility exists that the current drought will stretch into a fifth straight year in 2016 and beyond,\u201d Brown\u2019s order requires city and town water suppliers to reduce per capita usage. Brown\u2019s order would also: prohibit watering ornamental grass on public street medians; require new homes to use water-efficient drip irrigation system for landscaping; direct urban water agencies to set up a new pricing structure to maximize water conservation; require urban water and agricultural agencies to report more water usage information to the state. \u201cIt\u2019s a different world,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe have to act differently.\u201d Brown made the announcement while standing on a patch of brown grass in the Sierra Nevada, which would have historically been covered in snow. \u201cThis historic drought demands unprecedented action,\u201d Brown said in a statement. \u201cTherefore, I\u2019m issuing an executive order mandating substantial water reductions across our state. As Californians, we must pull together and save water in every way possible.\u201d The 1 April snowpack survey is an important indicator of the amount of water the state will have in its reservoirs as the state\u2019s wet historically wet season winds down. \u201cIn what were considered normal precipitation years, the snowpack supplied about 30 percent of California\u2019s water needs as it melts in the spring and summer,\u201d the DWR said in a statement on Wednesday. California relies on a few big storms during the winter months to drop snow on California\u2019s mountain ranges. During the spring and summer months the snowpack melts and fills the state\u2019s reservoirs. Historically, 1 April marked peak snowpack for the year. This year, the mountain runoff will be just a trickle. David Rizzardo, chief of snow surveys for the California Department of Water Resources, said the previous driest condition on the 1 April was 25%, which occurred in 2014 and 1977. \u201cWe\u2019re not only setting a new low, we\u2019re completely obliterating the previous record,\u201d he said on a conference call with reporters. \u201cAnd this is the supply of 30% of the state\u2019s fresh water.\u201d To conduct the survey, the state\u2019s water agency dispatches researchers to measure the level of snow manually at 250 separate sites in the Sierra Nevada, Rizzardo said. Additionally, the survey includes readings from 130 automated snow sensors. An official count will be released on Wednesday afternoon. Last week, Brown signed into law a more-than-$1bn plan to fast-track emergency relief to drought-stricken cities and communities, including food aid and drinking water. The proposal also includes hundreds of millions of dollars to fund long-term projects, involving water recycling, conservation awareness and flood control projects. At the signing, Brown said the plan was part of a wider effort to prepare California for an \u201cuncertain future\u201d. The package followed action by the state water board this month to pass what has been described as the most restrictive water conservation measures in state history. The plan limits the number of days residents can water their yards, and requires bars and restaurants to ask customers if they would like a glass of water before serving it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
