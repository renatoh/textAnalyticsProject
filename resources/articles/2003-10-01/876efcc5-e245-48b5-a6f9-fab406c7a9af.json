Should Inter overcome Lokomotiv Moscow at San Siro today the Arsenal manager considers the Italians' qualification to be guaranteed, and just one other team will progress from Group A. His uncertainty, coloured by the experience of a single Champions League win from the Gunners' last 11 games, is perhaps to be expected. \"If we lose against Kiev it is not in our hands any more,\" Wenger said yesterday. \"If Inter win they have qualified. Then the rest of us are playing for the second spot, and we cannot afford to lose. This is a big game for us. It is a game where we must get something.\" Past Arsenal results in the former Soviet Union do not inspire confidence. In four previous visits, they have lost 4-1 to Spartak Moscow, 3-0 to Shakhtar Donetsk and 3-1 to Kiev, though Wenger prefers to recall last month's \"solid\" 0-0 at Lokomotiv Moscow. The reasons for these European misadventures have been the subject of much analysis. The Arsenal forward Robert Pires puts it down to tactical predictability, a suggestion Wenger rejects. The Arsenal manager turned the tables on Pires, calling for him and his colleagues to relieve the goalscoring burden on Thierry Henry. The statistics are stark. Over the past 12 months in the Champions League Henry alone has scored for Arsenal away from home. \"Away from home our record has been quite decent, we are the No5 club in Europe because of good results,\" said Wenger. \"I think if you look at the last two years we have a good record away from home. But the scores are mainly from one person and it would be better to share that amongst the players. Goalscoring is an opportunity that should come from other positions. Thierry has been the main scorer away and we have been relying on that.\" Allied to the wayward finishing, and perhaps causing it, is Arsenal's tendency to lose composure in the face of adversity when in European competitions. Just once in the past 12 months have Arsenal come back from behind to win, in the 3-1 victory at Roma. Conversely, over that time they have let a lead slip on three occasions. \"I feel that, in the Champions League, if we concede we rush to make a difference,\" said Wenger. \"Against Chelsea on Saturday we knew we could come back from 1-1, in the Premiership we feel we can. \"That's why I feel we don't keep control. We need to be more relaxed and patient.\" Wenger must have agonised long over the match readiness of Patrick Vieira and Freddie Ljungberg, the pair having returned to near-fitness in the past week. Wenger was anxious for his captain Vieira, who has been suffering from a thigh injury, to travel to Kiev so that his dressing-room influence might be felt. Dynamo Kiev (probable, 4-4-1-1): Shovkovsky; Nesmachnii, Govrancic, Federov, Dimytrulin; Peev, Ghioane, Leko, Belkevich; Husyev; Satskikh. Arsenal (probable, 4-4-2): Lehmann; Lauren, Tour\u00e9, Campbell, Cole; Parlour, Gilberto, Vieira, Pires; Wiltord, Henry.
