Ballyhampshire Boy was odds-on to extend his winning sequence to five but Maguire, who went on to complete a 48-1 double on Murrayfield, pounced on the outside early in the straight with the Edward O'Grady-trained gelding. The favourite flattered briefly when hitting the front off the home bend, but it was left to Yeoman's Point to chase home Sacundai, who paid a considerable to his previous Fairyhouse conqueror, Like-A-Butterfly. Maguire partners Paris Pike for Ferdy Murphy in today's valuable Ericsson Chase at Leopardstown. This was due to feature the reappearance of Cheltenham Gold Cup favourite Sackville, but he is reported doubtful owing to a runny nose. Behrajan was cut to 16-1 from 25-1 by Ladbrokes for the Gold Cup after his highly impressive victory in the Rowland Meyrick Chase at Wetherby. But trainer Henry Daly was not getting carried away, saying: \"I don't know if he is a Gold Cup horse. We'll have to have a think about it and where we go next.\" \u00b7 Musselburgh faces an early-morning inspection to determine prospects for today's card following a forecast of a severe dip in temperature."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
