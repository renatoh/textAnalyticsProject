Mind you, the ferries are pricey. It's not just the fare and cabin but also the restaurant costs which can be very expensive if your tastes extend beyond junk food! Perhaps it's better to drive all the way. It's not a difficult drive so long as you keep your wits about you when going around Paris and Madrid on the motorways. Personally I stop in northern France on the first night of the journey and at Hendaye (on the France Spain border) on the second night. From Hendaye you can get to Algarve in one day.
