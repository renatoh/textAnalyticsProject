The manager was upset at Walker\u2019s 70th-minute aberration in which the defender \u2013 back in the set-up for the first time in 15 months \u2013 mistimed a challenge when on a yellow card. Southgate noted how sendings\u2011off had previously cost England at major tournaments. Gomez got away with his error when the Iceland midfielder Birkir Bjarnason missed from the spot, meaning that Raheem Sterling\u2019s penalty, scored moments earlier, proved to be the winner. But Southgate did little to disguise his frustration at Gomez. \u201cThe obvious lessons are the red card,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cYou can\u2019t make challenges like that. I know Kyle has held his hand up in the dressing room but it makes it so difficult to win games. \u201cAnd then to invite the pressure once we\u2019d scored in the way that we did \u2013 that was another lesson we have to learn. We hadn\u2019t really been in trouble up to that point and it\u2019s a really basic penalty that we\u2019ve given away. That took a bit of gloss off the win. We have to be tactically and psychologically more aware when we\u2019re 1-0 up with 90-plus minutes gone. \u201cKyle knows the situation. We all have to learn from that incident because we\u2019ve gone out of tournaments before because we\u2019ve been down to 10 men. That\u2019s not a situation we\u2019ve had in the four years I\u2019ve been in charge. So the response to it from the rest of the team was good. But it put us in a really difficult situation and also we lose him now for the Denmark game [on Tuesday]. \u201cIf we had scored the late penalty and that had been the end of it, we\u2019d have been talking about a performance of great character. We then give a really poor penalty away and it feels like we got out of jail.\u201d Walker, on the occasion of his 49th cap, was devastated at his dismissal. He had hoped to reach his half-century during this international window but that will not happen because of suspension. With competition for places in his position so intense, there are fears he could be stuck on 49 for some time. \u201cI have to take full blame,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI\u2019m an experienced player and I should know I\u2019m on a yellow card and to make a rash challenge like that is not acceptable from me.\u201d Asked if he was trying too hard to impress, Walker answered: \u201cPossibly. That probably plays a big part in it but I don\u2019t blame that. I\u2019m a seasoned professional and I have played a lot of games. I should know how to manage a game if I\u2019m on a yellow card. You have to say fair play to the lads for digging in and fighting and getting the win we needed.\u201d Southgate, who was unhappy that three rather than five substitutes were allowed \u2013 given the level of the players\u2019 fitness \u2013 said he did not see the midfielder James Ward-Prowse appearing to scuff the penalty spot with his foot shortly before Bjarnason\u2019s kick. Jordan Pickford said England had \u201cgot away with one\u201d when Bjarnason missed. He added: \u201cWith us getting a penalty down the other end \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen it back but I think the referee might have made an early decision to just give it to them. But a 1-0 win away from home is good for us.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 September 2020. Birkir Bjarnason plays for Iceland, not Finland as an earlier version stated. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
