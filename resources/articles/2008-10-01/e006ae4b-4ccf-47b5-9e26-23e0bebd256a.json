Today, the band are a neo-Britpop fixture, seemingly sent to wind up people who equate massive choruses with moronic rabble-rousing. Their detractors would have found much to dislike here: there was nothing clever or tricksy about their 60-minute trot through the ubiquitous hits from the new album, Off With Their Heads. Nor is there anything particularly remarkable about Ricky Wilson as a frontman except his stamina, which sees him pogoing and scissor-kicking from start to finish. His energy is so unquenchable that he even dances behind a roadie as he retrieves a kicked-over microphone stand. But if Kaiser Chiefs see a gig as essentially a protracted release of adrenaline, they have the songs to fill an hour, and that's enough. Beneath the romping melodies are articulate observations about dumbed-down Britain - current single Never Miss a Beat deplores today's infatuation with ignorance - but they are secondary to the tunes. \"Who bought our new album today?\" asks Wilson. Apparently, everybody did: when the band proceed to play half of it (first impression: bulky and less immediately likable), it's met with nearly the euphoria that greets their previous hits Ruby, Oh My God and I Predict a Riot. It is drummer Nick Hodgson's birthday, so there's nothing for it but for Wilson to lead a chant combining Happy Birthday and 50 Cent's In the Club. The house bawl along, and it's another victory for Kaiser Chiefs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
