Only Gay Kelleway, all the way back in the summer of 1987, had done it before and precious few had since been given a real opportunity of emulating her. It had to be Turner who finally killed off what had become one of the more notorious statistics in horse racing. Chipper and unpretentious despite a long list of achievements, she long ago established a talent for breaking new ground. The first woman to ride 100 winners in a year in British racing and the first to win a Group One race outright, she was also on the \u201cGirls\u201d team when they first won the Shergar Cup here, an event that has become her favourite day of the year. Kelleway and others showed that women can win in the saddle but it was Turner who made a habit of it and who did it at the sport\u2019s highest level as well. Now, thanks to the late surge of the 33-1 shot Thanks Be in the Sandringham Stakes, she has a Royal Ascot victory to her name as well. It came at the expense of the Queen, whose Magnetic Charm was beaten by just a neck. Asked what it meant to her, Turner replied with a cheerful dig at her only predecessor: \u201cQuite a lot because, although we all love Royal Ascot, we have to listen to Gay every year. Well done to her, because it\u2019s a great achievement and it\u2019s nice to have that goal to aim for. Hopefully now the standard of girls is so much, they\u2019ll just keep coming and coming.\u201d To the casual form student, Thanks Be had little to recommend her, having never previously won so much as a maiden race. Then again, Turner had never ridden her before. \u201cA significant step up is needed,\u201d mused the Racing Post\u2019s analyst in Friday\u2019s paper, but the successful jockey claimed she had known hours earlier that she had a big chance. \u201cAlfie, who rides her out all the time, said this morning: \u2018I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s drifted out to 50-1.\u2019\u201d Charlie Fellowes, the winning trainer, also filled the rider with confidence. \u201cShe just sliced through them easily,\u201d Turner said, slightly bemused that the summit so long admired from afar had suddenly been reached. \u201cAt least when I celebrated this time, I didn\u2019t nearly fall off. I\u2019m getting the hang of it.\u201d Turner has been invited by many a reporter to complain about chauvinism in the sport and, indeed, there must be some reason why the capable female jockeys around these days do not get more rides in this key week. But she has always insisted that the chances are there for any jockey who proves to be deserving. \u201cI went in the changing room today and there was Josephine Gordon, Hollie Doyle, Nicola Currie, they\u2019re all there all the time now. The standard is just so high and they all deserve to be here with good rides. The media are all: \u2018Aw, the girls don\u2019t get a fair chance,\u2019 but the numbers are rising and in 10 years\u2019 time, the girls will be having winners more often and it won\u2019t be a big thing. It\u2019s just gonna snowball but it\u2019ll take time.\u201d \u201cWell done, Hayley,\u201d said Kelleway, who is a trainer these days and watched the Sandringham from Goodwood, where she was preparing to saddle a runner. \u201cShe\u2019s been around for long enough, she deserves it.\u201d There was, she admitted, a slight piquancy to the fact that she is no longer the only woman to have won at Royal Ascot, but Kelleway has always been a supporter of female jockeys, always been adamant that plenty of them are good enough to win here on the right horse. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not another 32 years until the next one,\u201d she added. Dettori and Moore will fight to finish for crown The most successful Royal Ascot jockeys of the last 30 years traded blows throughout the afternoon here on Friday, and Frankie Dettori and Ryan Moore will go head-to-head once again on Saturday on the fifth and final card of the Royal meeting, with the prize for the week\u2019s leading rider still in the balance, writes Greg Wood. Dettori has not finished Ascot week as the top jockey for 15 years, while Moore has taken the crown eight times in the last nine years. It is Dettori, though, who will head into the last six races with the upper hand, despite Moore riding a double, on Japan in the King Edward VII Stakes and Baghdad in the concluding Duke Of Edinburgh Stakes, in which Dettori finished second on the fast-finishing Ben Vrackie. Dettori had earlier responded to Moore\u2019s success on Japan with victory in the Group One Commonwealth Cup aboard Advertise. He is the leading current rider at Royal Ascot with 67 winners since breaking his duck at the meeting with Markofdistinction in the Queen Anne Stakes in 1990. Moore, who got off the mark in 2008, is the only other current jockey within sight of Dettori\u2019s total, having compiled his figure of 57 at a much faster rate. It is Dettori who has been setting the pace here this week, however, most memorably when recording the first four-timer at the Royal meeting since 1965 when he took the first four races on Thursday. He equalled his best return from a single Royal meeting when Advertise beat a strong field including Moore\u2019s mount Ten Sovereigns, the even-money favourite, in the Commonwealth Cup, and his seventh winner in the four days was registered in emphatic style. Moore needs to find two winners on Saturday to snatch the riders\u2019 title from Dettori on countback, having held off Dettori\u2019s charge in the concluding race to register what could prove to be a pivotal success by a short head. Dettori is a 1-5 shot with Paddy Power to maintain his lead, while Moore is 3-1 to get his head back in front."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
