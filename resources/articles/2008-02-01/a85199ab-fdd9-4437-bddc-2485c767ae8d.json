An independent report released in December named Clemens, an eleven-time all-star and a seven-time winner of Cy Young awards for best pitching in baseball, as a user of performance-enhancing drugs. Commissioned by baseball's top officials, the report revealed widespread use of steroids that artificially boost muscles for training. But Clemens disputed the report, which was supervised by former senator George Mitchell \u2013 a key negotiator in the Northern Ireland peace process. Clemens accused his ex-trainer, Brian McNamee, of lying to Mitchell's investigators and to Congress about his drugs use. \"If I am guilty of anything, it is of being too trusting of others, wanting to see the best in everyone, and being nice to everyone,\" Clemens said today. At stake is more than Clemens' place among the best baseball pitchers of all time. The oversight committee of the House of Representatives, where Clemens and McNamee testified under oath today, could refer criminal perjury charges against either man to the justice department. \"If Mr McNamee is lying, then he has acted inexcusably and made Mr Clemens an innocent victim,\" Democratic congressman Henry Waxman, chairman of the committee, said. \"If Mr Clemens isn't telling the truth, then he has acted shamefully and unconscionably smeared Mr McNamee. I don't think there's anything in between.\" Concerned about baseball officials' inability to regulate steroid use and the drugs scandal's effect on the sport, Congress has investigated the issue since 2005. But today's testimony failed to decisively incriminate Clemens or McNamee, as many Democrats appeared to side with the former trainer and many Republicans appeared to side with Clemens. After McNamee admitted making several false statements during the inquiry's early stages, Republican congressman Dan Burton became agitated: \"This is really disgusting \u2026 I know one thing I don't believe, and that's you,\" he said. The drama was compounded thanks to Andy Pettitte, who pitched alongside Clemens on the New York Yankees and Houston Astros teams. Pettitte, a friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Clemens, admitted using steroids, telling Congress that he and Clemens spoke about drug use in 1999 or 2000. Pettitte did not appear today, avoiding a public confrontation with Clemens, but provided private testimony in advance. Clemens said his team-mate misspoke, claiming that his wife, Debbie, was the steroids user in question. Waxman said his investigators confirmed that McNamee did inject Debbie Clemens \u2014 who posed in a skimpy bikini for the 2003 Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue \u2014 with performance-enhancing drugs. Despite the media circus caused by the steroids report, baseball remains a hugely profitable sport in the US. Baseball's annual revenue exceeded $6bn last year, according to CNN, almost breaking the record profits reached annually by American football."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
