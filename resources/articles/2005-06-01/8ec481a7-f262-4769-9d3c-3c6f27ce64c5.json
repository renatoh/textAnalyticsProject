A hip injury has meant the Warwickshire left-arm spinner has been missing from the squad since the start of the recent Test series against Bangladesh. So slow had it been in responding to the cortisone injection administered just before the first of those matches at Lord's, however, that he was replaced in the one-day squad by Gareth Batty, with the further prospect of him not being fit for the first Test against Australia in little more than five weeks. But now the aches are gone and Giles is ready for some cricket before rejoining his England colleagues. Today, he will play for Warwickshire second XI against their Glamorgan counterparts at Neath. If that goes well and there is no reaction over the next few days, he will play for the Bears against Leicestershire at Edgbaston on Sunday. Again, if there is no reaction he will join England in time to play against Bangladesh at Trent Bridge next Tuesday. \"I spent about three hours bowling and fielding,\" Giles said yesterday, \"and I am virtually pain-free. \"The only concern with the management was that after 2 weeks of rehabilitation, and no match practice, it would be asking too much to go straight into a strenuous one-day series without having played. So it is a question of play, practise, play some more, see if there is any more reaction and then get back into it.\" But it is possible the condition, specifically affecting the cartilage in the joint, will require keyhole surgery at some stage. The minimum recovery time after that is two months. Finding a window of opportunity will not be easy. But with the tour of Pakistan finishing shortly before Christmas and that of India not until March, a chance might be found then."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
