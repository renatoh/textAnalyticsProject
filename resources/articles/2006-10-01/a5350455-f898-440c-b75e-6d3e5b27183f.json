McCormack experienced the bitter taste of defeat in the last two years as his Whitehaven charges lost out to Leigh and Castleford in the 2004 and 2005 grand finals. He left the Recreation Ground to take up the challenge of lifting the relegated Vikings straight back into Super League, and now McCormack has got his new side to within 80 minutes of a top-flight return. Widnes will play Hull Kingston Rovers in next Sunday's final at Warrington and their victory here means that there will be no last-minute reprieve from relegation for Castleford Tigers. The Tigers were pinning their hopes on Whitehaven lifting the title as they have failed to meet the criteria for Super League this year. McCormack had to ensure a nerve-shredding final quarter as Whitehaven came back strongly from 24-12 down. The visitors scored tries through David Seeds and Spencer Miller, but Carl Rudd's failure to convert either left the Vikings with a narrow advantage and 'Haven's last hopes disappeared when the desperate Widnes full-back Gavin Dodd beat Steve Maden to a kick through by Mark Leafa. \"We ground out the victory and the team spirit was fantastic,\" McCormack said. \"When we lost our play-off game at Hull KR last week there was big pressure on us but the players responded superbly. \"Next week's game will be a great occasion and we have got to make sure that we produce our best performance of the season. It will be a good game between two good sides, but getting to the final will only mean something if we win it.\" Widnes's former Castleford winger Damien Blanch recovered from a third-minute blunder that gifted a try to Miller by scoring himself in the corner and creating another try for Dodd after a thrilling touchline run. With a further try from the influential Mark Smith, one of 11 former Wigan players in the Vikings' ranks, Widnes led 18-8 lead at half-time. Leroy Joe pulled a try back for 'Haven but Sean Gleeson looked to have clinched the Vikings' grand final place when he dived on a loose ball from Ian Watson's kick - but Whitehaven's fightback spirit kept McCormack anxious to the end.
