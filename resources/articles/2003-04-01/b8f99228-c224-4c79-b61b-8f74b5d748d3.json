To the thinktanks - the Institute for Public Policy Research has got its baby bonds; to the housing associations - they got their exemption from stamp duty; to the regions - the regional development agencies get extra powers. The chancellor delivered to the lobbies. And maybe he intended that to be a lesson. Bang on the door, make a fuss and - at least within economic circumstances that are looking more and more straitened - Uncle Gordon will do his best. There is a serious point here. Privately, Gordon Brown is wont to say: why don't you ask me for more, why don't you hold my feet to the fire, on child poverty for example. What he means is that politicians mostly act under pressure and on some of his big picture issues, notably family income, he has not been under sufficient pressure. Childcare is another example. No disrespect to the excellent work done by Daycare Trust and others, but their voices are small. Conventional wisdom says Brown's principal devices for lifting family income, the child and working tax credits, are too complicated, too ornate, also (a strong criticism) they interact perversely with housing benefit (yet more \"major reforms\" announced in the Budget). Those criticisms may be justified but they may also miss the point. The purpose is pristine. It's to increase the amount of money flowing into the purse in households on the edge. What Brown needs (and may even want) is pressure to do more. He says that as a result of all his measures since Labour came to power, families with children are \u00a31,200 a year better off, after allowing for inflation. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has backed his contention that households in the poorest slice of income distribution have done differentially well. The lobbying response should surely be: more, more, more. But look around the papers, including even the Guardian as they respond to the Budget. How much attention gets paid to the poverty target or the condition of lower income families with children? How many donations will be made to the struggling poverty charities as a result of people seeing that government can act, does indeed act, but could do much more? Budgets are artificial crests in the wavy sea of policy and admin. But they do provide a glimpse of priorities, however under-realised. Once again, Gordon Brown - on behalf of the Blair government - has stated the commitment to abolishing child poverty, while claiming progress is being made. And producing some evidence. The best response ought to be a cheer - followed by a renewed determination to lobby, campaign, knock loudly on the newly refurbished door of the Treasury and ask for more."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
