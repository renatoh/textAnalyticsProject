Billionaire's eccentric idea will get a vote", "bodyText": "A proposal by the billionaire venture capitalist and Bitcoin investor Tim Draper to divide California into three separate states will appear on the November 2018 ballot after the \u201cCal 3\u201d campaign garnered enough signatures for a statewide referendum. Cal 3 is Draper\u2019s latest effort to break up the country\u2019s most populous state. In 2014, he spent $5.2m on a campaign to split the state into six pieces, but failed to qualify for the ballot when only about 750,000 of the 1.14m signatures collected were found to be valid. This time around, Draper cut the number of new states in half, and cleared the requirement for petitioners, reportedly paying canvassers $3 per signature. The three new states would be Northern California, roughly comprising the northern half of the state, including San Francisco, Silicon Valley and Sacramento; Southern California, stretching from Fresno to the US-Mexico border; and California, comprising six coastal counties between Los Angeles and Monterey. \u201cThreeCAs will give Californians better education, better infrastructure and lower taxes,\u201d Draper said in a statement when he launched the campaign in November. \u201cThree new state governments will be able to start fresh, to innovate and better serve their people.\u201d If approved, the partition would mark the first division of a US state since the pro-union West Virginia broke from secessionist Virginia during the US civil war. But don\u2019t start adding stars to the US flag yet: even if the idea were to win voter approval, it would still have to clear numerous hurdles, including getting approval from the US Congress. \u201cMy guess is [voters] will vote this down, and this will all be a waste of time,\u201d said Jim Newton, a lecturer in public policy at the University of California Los Angeles. \u201cBut no children or animals will be hurt in the process. It\u2019s a fatuous exercise but it\u2019s not fatal.\u201d It\u2019s not immediately clear what the constituency is for the proposal, beyond the eccentric Draper. An April poll by SurveyUSA found support for the measure among registered voters was just 17%. Draper made his fortune investing in Hotmail and Skype, and made headlines in recent years over his investments in cryptocurrency and staunch support of Theranos and its disgraced founder, Elizabeth Holmes. Draper also runs a school for entrepreneurs called \u201cDraper University of Heroes\u201d and once performed a striptease in honor of the female entrepreneurs in whose companies he has invested. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone else in the state besides Tim Draper thinks this is a good idea,\u201d said Steven Maviglio, a Democratic political consultant and spokesman for the official opposition campaign, OneCalifornia. \u201cOur only difficulty is getting people to take it seriously ... In this political climate, you have to take everything seriously.\u201d The Cal 3 campaign blames \u201cthe Sacramento system of top-down control\u201d for the state\u2019s various ills, and suggests that having state governments \u201ccloser to home\u201d will result in better outcomes for education, infrastructure and taxes. \u201cI think it\u2019s actually fairly ludicrous,\u201d said Newton. \u201cWhy three states? Why not 30 states? Why not 300? ... Substantively, I don\u2019t think it solves any problems California confronts.\u201d There are also a host of legal obstacles that could stymie the effort. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more than just an initiative that would be required to split California in three parts,\u201d said Eric McGhee, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. \u201cEven if this were to pass, it would face a real struggle in Congress, or it would be tied up in legal issues in California, or both.\u201d Vikram David Amar, the dean of the University of Illinois College of Law, has suggested that the Draper proposal, which is written as an amendment to the state constitution, may not pass legal muster. \u201cThere is a very strong argument that Mr Draper\u2019s proposal would constitute a \u2018revision\u2019 to rather than an \u2018amendment\u2019 of the California constitution,\u201d he wrote in April. A constitutional revision cannot be placed on the ballot in the same manner as an amendment. Whether Draper has any chance of seeing his dream come true, he has certainly succeeded in making the state\u2019s voters debate his idea, which may stir more debate over California\u2019s referendum process. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten further and further away from the idea that this is a populous or progressive process,\u201d said Newton. \u201cIt really is a money process, and anyone with enough money that wants to get something on the ballot can do it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
