What he got instead was a Swede bearing a question about national service. At such moments cornflakes can wait. \"The manager knocked on my door,\" Owen explained an hour or so later. \"He said: 'How do you fancy being the captain tomorrow?' I said: 'Just a little bit.' That was it. I was surprised.\" The fact that he has never led out any team at senior level went through neither man's mind as they stood discussing the armband left available by David Beckham and last seen on the shirt of Robbie Fowler during the final stages of England's last friendly, against Italy at Elland Road. Fowler was a Leeds United player captaining his country at his club's home and his former Liverpool team-mate will do the same tonight at Anfield against Paraguay. \"It will be special in front of the home crowd,\" Owen said. \"Maybe playing at Liverpool had something to do with the decision.\" Eriksson confirmed that it was \"a small part\" of his deliberations. Voted European footballer of the year already, the captaincy is the latest landmark of many in the career of the 22-year-old. \"It's different to winning a cup; it's a privilege,\" he said. He has yet to lead Liverpool, although he told the story of how he once sprinted for the armband at a Uefa Cup tie in Valencia four years ago after the captain Paul Ince and his deputy Steve McManaman had both been sent off. \"I've been captain for five minutes for Liverpool,\" he joked. \"Obviously I'm not expecting to keep it. David Beckham is the captain of England and, who knows, if Rio Ferdinand or Sol Campbell were in the squad then I might not be sitting here. But I am, and, though I know I'm not going to be here forever, being given it is a great responsibility and honour for me.\" His smile said as much and he will not be an aggressive, clenched-fist kind of leader. \"I'm not going to shout and bawl like certain ones,\" he said, \"David Beckham isn't like that, he's more a leader on the pitch through his performances, and I hope I can be more like that.\" The image of Beckham, who yesterday visited the hotel and congratulated Owen personally, has been transformed since he was awarded the captaincy, maturity replacing petulance, and though Owen tiptoed away from saying his untarnished public image mattered greatly to him - he is not averse to a bet and a pint, and is wary of hypocrisy - Eriksson said that it was a consideration in his thinking. \"I don't know if I'm using the right word,\" Eriksson said, \"but for me he is a clean young footballer, a clean killer, how is that? He will be in the squad and in the team for many years if he is fit. It is a decision for this game. Then, if David isn't fit against South Korea, we will see what happens. But also I'm looking a bit to the future.\" \"I would prefer to be seen in a decent light rather than non-decent,\" Owen said, \"but I don't go on the pitch meaning to be anything. Off the pitch I try to do things the right way to enable me to play. But clean-cut? That's for others to say.\" What others have been saying about his fitness has clearly been exercising his thoughts of late. \"It's been happening for five years now that when I come back from injury for a couple of games I don't feel ready to go on blistering runs. So I can't understand why it's being said now. \"I got a lot of stick after the Bayer Leverkusen game but I was really pleased after that game to have done a load of sprints and got into good positions. I felt really sharp, back to my best. In the next game [at Sunderland] I proved that I can finish. \"It's probably in your mind more than anything. The injury has healed but then the last memory of sprinting was the one where you got injured. It does take a little to break through that barrier again.\" Breaking barriers has long been an Owen trademark. He was the youngest-ever scorer for England - against Morocco in his fourth international in May 1998 - having been the youngest cap since 1900 three months earlier. Now he is the youngest captain since Bobby Moore. Next in his sights are three famous England goalscorers: Roger Hunt, Johnny Haynes and Kevin Keegan. Keegan is seven goals ahead of him; if the young striker equals that in June, England and Owen will have had a good World Cup. And it won't matter who is captain.
