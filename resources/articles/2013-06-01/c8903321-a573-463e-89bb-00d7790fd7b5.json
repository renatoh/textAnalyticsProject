The human resources body, CIPD, says its roundup of workplace statistics from around the G8 and the emerging BRICS economies highlight the stark contrasts in work and working lives around the world. The UK is close behind Canada in the contentment rankings, followed by Germany, Italy and the US. In Canada 91% of those in work report being satisfied with life. At 81%, France was the lowest ranked in the G8 and India was bottom, at 39%, once the BRICS \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa are included. Unsurprisingly, the CIPD found a strong correlation between average pay and satisfaction with life, in its analysis of data from a variety of sources including the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and International Labour Organisation. Among the more wacky facts about workplaces around the world, it found that nearly one in five American companies allow pets in the workplace. In France, the average lunch break is now 22 minutes, compared with 90 minutes 20 years ago. In the UK, the average worker spends 29 minutes on lunch, with people in Birmingham and Coventry taking the shortest break, at 25 minutes. The group also highlighted signs of growing pressures \u2013 both financial and physical \u2013 on UK workers. One third of UK employers say they have seen more people coming into work sick in the past year. The proportion of the UK workforce who are \"underemployed\" \u2013 not getting as many hours of work as they wish \u2013 has risen to 9.9% in 2012 from 6.2% in 2008. Against a backdrop of high unemployment and falling wages in many member states, CIPD is urging G8 leaders meeting in Northern Ireland to look at workers and ways to nurture talent alongside their talks on tax, trade and transparency. CIPD chief executive Peter Cheese commented: \"As we compete in an increasingly globalised economy, it's more important now than ever that we open our eyes to the enormous differences in the ways the world works. We need to see what we can learn from other countries, and think carefully about what we can productively contribute to a global economy.\" He added: \"Employers are increasingly seeing a mismatch between the skills available to them locally and the skills they need from a workforce: what skills do we need to be developing in our workforce to ensure that we're able to do productive work in the modern world?\" The analysis found that Russia topped the rankings for the percentage of senior management positions held by women at 46%. Italy was second with 36%, followed by South Africa, Brazil and Canada. The UK was 8th out of the 12 countries and the US was 9th."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
