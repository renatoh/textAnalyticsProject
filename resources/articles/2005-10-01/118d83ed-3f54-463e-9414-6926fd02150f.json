The apology came as the world's second largest advertising group was set a deadline of November 25 to announce whether it will bid for Aegis, owner of Europe's largest media buying network. Neil French was worldwide creative director at WPP until he resigned last week after his comments at an industry event earlier this month received widespread press attention. Sir Martin said WPP was still awaiting clarification of Mr French's comments, but the group wholly rejected biased attitudes towards women. \"If his remarks are correct then he spoke out of line, and out of line with our principles and record. If he has not apologised and he is standing his ground, we apologise on his behalf,\" he said. Sir Martin added that he did not expect the episode to cause long-term damage to WPP, which owns the Young &amp; Rubicam and Ogilvy &amp; Mather agencies. The British executive said two of the group's biggest businesses were run by women: Ann Fudge at Young &amp; Rubicam Brands and Shelley Lazarus at Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide. Sir Martin added that Mr French was attempting to make a \"serious point\" about the difficulties facing women in the professional working environment, but he had made a rare mistake for an advertising executive: bad communication. \"He was trying to make a point that a lot of people have made, that women do not get opportunities that they should because of commitments they have to their families. We as an industry have to do more work on that,\" he said. The apology came as WPP was given a \"put up or shut up\" notice by the Takeover Panel over its interest in Aegis. Sir Martin declined to comment on the London-based group, but it is understood that WPP is waiting for more information on Aegis's contracts with major clients before deciding whether to bid for the business in tandem with Hellman &amp; Friedman, the US private equity group. The would-be bidders fear a repeat of the situation at Interpublic, the world's third largest advertising group, which is handing back bulk discounts - or incentives for booking large amounts of advertising space - to its clients. WPP also reported an organic revenue increase of just under 5% in the third quarter yesterday. Including the $1.5bn (\u00a3840m) acquisition of Grey Global and currency fluctuations, turnover for the three months to September 30 rose 26% to \u00a31.3bn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
