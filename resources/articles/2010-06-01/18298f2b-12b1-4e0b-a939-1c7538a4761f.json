I breast the rocks near Alcock Tarn, a viewpoint gained by the walkers each year who make their way up through the woods and on to the fellside above Dove Cottage, and take stock. Boughs laden with hawthorn blossom still gild the slopes this late spring-in-midsummer the Lake District is experiencing, and the breeze-ruffled lake water far beneath cuts a dash. Cutting a dash was the prerogative of the man who is standing by the rocks with a hawk-like look as he gazes down, as it were, the chimneypots of the village below beloved by William Wordsworth. Twelve minutes and one second is all it took for Kenny Stuart to run up and down this same mountainside during May in 1985 as he relives those moments when he had wings on his feet, and left his rivals trailing. It has never been broken since, that record time for sprinting up Butter Crag and rocketing down in leaps and bounds, although many try to best it each year. The walkers now toiling their way past pass by this lean and muscular man, less than nine stone in weight and 5ft 5in tall in his fell boots, unaware there is a tiger in their midst. Perhaps it was this electrifying run \u2013 along with so many others where the fell running records he set up in the 80s from Snowdon to Ben Nevis still stand today \u2013 that in some way led to the chronic fatigue syndrome condition responsible for slowing his system and stopping his fell running, if not his spirit. That it could never do. The effortless lope across the fells of this groundsman at Newton Rigg College, near Penrith, at the age of 53 still gives a hint of what \"once was\" to an almost superhuman degree."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
