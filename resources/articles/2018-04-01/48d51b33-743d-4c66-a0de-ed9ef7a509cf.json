His intervention, in an article in the Observer, comes as millions of voters prepare to go the polls on Thursday in local elections in which Labour hopes to seize flagship Tory councils in London and other urban areas. Khan had stopped short of demanding the home secretary\u2019s resignation, believing she should be given a chance to explain and put right the evident administrative failings and chaos inside the Home Office. But allies said that revelations in the Guardian on Friday that Rudd had in fact been informed of specific targets for the removal of immigrants \u2013 having been copied in on a detailed six-page memo giving details of them \u2013 were the last straw. Khan writes that the \u201clatest revelations have exposed Amber Rudd even further as someone who appears completely unaware about what is going on in her own department. It frankly beggars belief. What the home secretary and prime minister don\u2019t appear to understand is that the Windrush scandal is the direct consequence of their policies and not just another example of the administrative chaos at the Home Office. \u201cIt is about a generation who have lived all their lives here suddenly feeling they are not wanted here. Rather than hiding behind process or blaming civil servants yet again, the time has now surely come for the home secretary to resign.\u201d Allies of Khan, London\u2019s first Muslim mayor and the son of immigrant parents who came to London from Pakistan in the 1960s, said he had to speak out because he felt a responsibility toward the millions of other immigrant families in the UK. Khan says: \u201cAs the scandalous treatment of the Windrush generation emerged, Conservative politicians tried to give the impression that it was an anomaly, an accidental series of mistakes. But the British people know this is a lie. We know that, in reality, it was the deliberate intention to create a \u2018hostile environment\u2019 for migrants. We know this because they have repeatedly bragged about this for years.\u201d Rudd\u2019s future and controversy over Tory immigration policy look certain to become a central factor in the many high-profile contests in Thursday\u2019s elections. Labour is hoping to cause a series of political upsets by beating the Tories in their traditional strongholds of Wandsworth, Westminster and Barnet in London and in Trafford in Greater Manchester. More than 4,300 seats are being contested in 151 mainly urban councils. Government sources insist May did not consider sacking Rudd on Friday evening, nor had Rudd offered her resignation, after the Guardian provided details of the memo contradicting Rudd\u2019s claims there was no policy of immigration targets. \u201cOur role at No 10 was to convey to the home secretary that she had the prime minister\u2019s full support and confidence,\u201d said one source. Rudd will make a statement to the Commons on the crisis on Monday. Senior Tory MPs said May would do everything in her power to hold on to Rudd, not only to shield herself from blame for immigration policy when she was home secretary but also because a resignation or sacking would harm the Tories in the run-up to Thursday\u2019s polls. Ministers have rallied around Rudd after she admitted that she should have known about the official targets for removing illegal immigrants. In a series of late-night tweets, she said that, although her office had been copied in to the memo, she did not see it herself. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, led her defence, saying that Rudd was \u201ca highly talented and highly effective minister\u201d, and accused Labour of trying to \u201cweaponise\u201d the issue. \u201cWhen documents that should be placed in front of a home secretary aren\u2019t then placed in front of a home secretary, that is sad, that is regrettable,\u201d he told the Today programme. \u201cBut she was very clear both in her apology and also in the fact that this specific document wasn\u2019t placed in her box, wasn\u2019t brought to her attention.\u201d The Cabinet Office minister, David Lidington, said Rudd was dealing with \u201cone of the biggest challenges in government\u201d, and that she had the \u201cresourcefulness and determination\u201d to get the job done."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
