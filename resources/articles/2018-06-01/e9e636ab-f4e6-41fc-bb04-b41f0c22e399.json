He did not mention the Eagles or attempt to heal divisions. The event on the south lawn had been intended to follow the tradition of US presidents welcoming the national football champions to the White House. But on Monday night Trump disinvited the Eagles after learning that fewer than 10 players planned to attend, reopening his feud with American athletes over protests during the national anthem. Instead, a \u201ccelebration of America\u201d for Eagles fans was promised. Four US national flags hung on the south portico and 18 more curved around the south lawn. A few hundred people gathered, many waving stars and stripes, but there were more suits and ties than Eagles shirts or caps on display. \u201cThis is a beautiful, big celebration,\u201d claimed Trump, notorious for his obsession with size, at the end of remarks that lasted only four minutes. \u201cActually, to be honest, it\u2019s even bigger than we had anticipated.\u201d With that, the US marine band and the US army chorus, their helmets and tunic buttons gleaming in the summer sun, played God Bless America. Trump sang some of the words but his lips were sealed for trickier lines, suggesting that his knowledge of Irving Berlin\u2019s patriotic song is somewhat sketchy. He then departed and the crowd began to disperse, showing little interest in the band music that moved on to hits by the Four Seasons and others. Earlier, during the national anthem, one man in the crowd had taken the knee in protest, emulating Colin Kaepernick and other football players, though no Eagles made the gesture last season. There was also a shout of \u201cEagles\u201d and some heckling at the start of Trump\u2019s speech, eliciting boos from the crowd. The president said: \u201cWe love our country. We respect our flag. And we always proudly stand for the national anthem. We always will stand for the national anthem.\u201d There was a cheer from a gathering that seemed more like a Trump rally than a football watch party. The president went on to reel off achievements including unemployment figures and claiming: \u201cOur country has never done better than it\u2019s doing right now. Never!\u201d There was support for Trump\u2019s stand against the NFL players\u2019 protests among the guests. Steve Woods, a retired business lobbyist from Alexandria, Virginia, described himself as a lifelong Eagles fan. \u201cIt would be nice if they showed up but I didn\u2019t think they would,\u201d he said, a Stars and Stripes in his top pocket. \u201cToo much peer pressure to be politically correct.\u201d The 69-year-old, who voted for Trump because of his policies for small businesses, added: \u201cThe great thing about our country is they can make a political statement and he can make a political statement.\u201d Michael Carr, 56, a logistician from Philadelphia, said: \u201cI agree with the president 100%. The whole situation is disappointing. I believe respecting our country should have nothing to do with one personal\u2019s beliefs. It\u2019s simply a matter of pride and respect. Our flag and anthem are sacrosanct and not a matter of debate in my view.\u201d Trump\u2019s statement on Monday cancelling the visit cited player protests throughout the NFL over police brutality and racial inequality. \u201cThey disagree with their president,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause he insists that they proudly stand for the national anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country.\u201d On Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted against a form of protest that will be allowed under an NFL policy banning kneeling during the anthem on the field or sidelines that was announced last month. \u201cStaying in the locker room for the playing of our national anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling,\u201d Trump wrote, returning again to an issue seen as attractive to his Republican base. \u201cSorry!\u201d Later, a statement issued by the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said that \u201cdespite sensing a lack of good faith\u201d, the White House had \u201cattempted to work with the Eagles\u201d. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Sanders added, \u201cthe Eagles offered to send only a tiny handful of representatives, while making clear that the great majority of players would not attend the event, despite planning to be in DC today. In other words, the vast majority of the Eagles team decided to abandon their fans. \u201cUpon learning these facts, the president decided to change the event so that it would be a celebration of the American flag with Eagles fans and performances by United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus.\u201d The Eagles issued a statement that avoided the issue, paying tribute instead to the supporters who followed the team to its first Super Bowl win. The NFL Players Association said the cancellation had resulted in the concurrent cancellation of \u201cseveral player-led community service events for young people\u201d in the Washington DC area. \u201cOur union is disappointed in the decision by the White House to disinvite players from the Philadelphia Eagles from being recognized and celebrated by all Americans for their accomplishment,\u201d the statement said. \u201cNFL players love their country, support our troops, give back to their communities and strive to make America a better place.\u201d LeBron James and Steph Curry, star players for the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors, indicated their teams would not accept any invitation to visit the White House should they win the NBA finals series. At the daily White House briefing on Tuesday afternoon, Sanders seemed to attempt again to cast the NFL team in a bad light with its followers, saying: \u201cThe Eagles are the ones that changed their commitment at the last minute \u2026 and the president thinks that the fans deserve better than that. \u201cCertainly,\u201d she added, \u201cwe would hope that all of the people of Pennsylvania would share the Potus\u2019s commitment to the national anthem and pride that we have in the country.\u201d Pennsylvania was one of a group of usually Democratic states that Trump won in 2016, paving his road to an electoral college victory despite losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3m ballots. A Trump-backed candidate, however, recently lost a special election in a Pennsylvania district the president took by 20 points. Though many of Trump\u2019s usual Republican supporters rallied to his side on Tuesday, there was some dissent in party ranks. Ryan Costello, a Pennsylvania congressman, wrote: \u201cThis is a depressing commentary on our political culture, very deflating to me. Was really excited for today. As a fan who bleeds green. Not going to WH. Disappointed in all of this.\u201d Among a number of Democrats and Pennsylvania lawmakers who criticised Trump, Philadelphia\u2019s mayor, Jim Kenney, said the president was a \u201cfragile egomaniac\u201d. Speaking to CNN on Tuesday, the Democrat defended players\u2019 rights to protest under the first amendment. He did not want to debate the issue with the president, he said, because the president was \u201ca child\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
