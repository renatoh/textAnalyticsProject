They are concerned that too many pupils who are excluded from mainstream education, sometimes after minor breaches of zero-tolerance behaviour policies, end up on part-time timetables of as little as two hours a day in pupil referral units. With less time in the classroom, children are at greater risk of criminal exploitation and involvement in violence, a report by the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on knife crime has said. The report, Back to School? Breaking the Link Between School Exclusions and Knife Crime, calls on ministers to review the system so that all excluded children have access to the full-time education they are legally entitled to. It also calls for mainstream schools to be more accountable for the children they exclude. \u201cToo many children are being socially excluded and marked as failures, with tragic consequences,\u201d the report says. \u201cAll too often the moment of school exclusion is the tipping point that leads to young people picking up knives.\u201d The report highlights an \u201calarming\u201d rise in school exclusions. In 2017/18 there were 7,900 permanent exclusions from schools in England \u2013 a 70% increase since 2012/13. At the same time, it says there has been a \u201cworrying\u201d rise in youth knife crime. According to the report, more than 17,500 boys aged 14 in England and Wales carry a knife or weapon and a third of those have had weapons used against them. New Ministry of Justice figures published on Thursday show knife crime continuing to rise, with the number of first-time knife crime offenders up by 25% in the last five years. In the 12 months to the end of June, 22,306 knife or dangerous weapon offences were dealt with in England and Wales, up from 21,314 the previous year. \u201cThe number of children being excluded from school and locked out of opportunities is a travesty,\u201d said the APPG chair and Labour MP for Croydon Central, Sarah Jones. \u201cOften these children have literally nowhere to go. They are easy pickings for criminal gangs looking to exploit vulnerable children.\u201d The Department for Education warned against drawing a simple causal link between exclusions and crime. \u201cThe issues surrounding knife crime and poor behaviour in schools are complicated and multi-faceted,\u201d a government spokesman said. The APPG talked to young people about their experiences of exclusion. Some said zero-tolerance behaviour policies meant schools were increasingly dependent on using exclusions \u2013 both fixed-term and permanent \u2013 to address relatively minor misdemeanours. \u201cI would get excluded more often and sent home more often, for unnecessary reasons, like not wearing a blazer, my socks not coming up to my knees. Just silly things like that,\u201d said one. \u201cIt is encouraging kids to go out and do what they want because you are not giving them an education.\u201d Another said: \u201cSince they kicked me out I\u2019ve got time on my hands to do more crime, commit more crime \u2026 in Croydon with my friends who have also been kicked out who are also doing wrong things, who are also selling drugs [and] who are also carrying knives.\u201d The report also raises concerns about recent leaked government plans suggesting an increased focus on school discipline, as revealed in the Guardian, warning: \u201cIf we see more schools adopting stricter approaches to school discipline, we are likely to see greater use of exclusions.\u201d It calls instead for schools to be given the funding to support vulnerable children, with a focus on prevention and early intervention. It says every council should appoint a leader responsible for children excluded from school and school rankings, and results should take account of all pupils, including those they exclude. A government spokesman said: \u201cThe government has been clear that it will always back teachers and headteachers in delivering discipline in the classroom. We are clear that permanent exclusion should only be used as a last resort and exclusion from school must not mean exclusion from education.\u201d Julie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cThe causes of knife crime are complex, and we need to be careful not to make school exclusions the scapegoat for this issue. However, it is certainly the case that we need to do better for vulnerable young people.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
