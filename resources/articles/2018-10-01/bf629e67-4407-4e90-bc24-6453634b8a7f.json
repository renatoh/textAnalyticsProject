The midfielder\u2019s deal runs out next summer and he is aware the ball is in Chelsea\u2019s court. However F\u00e0bregas is enjoying life under Maurizio Sarri and the 31-year-old, who has dropped down the pecking order after missing the start of the season with a knee injury, does not want to leave. \u201cI\u2019m very open about it,\u201d F\u00e0bregas said. \u201cTo be the honest the club has not said anything. At the end of the day I have eight months left and at the moment I\u2019m gone. But I\u2019d love to stay at the club. I\u2019ve been very happy for the last four years and a half. We\u2019ve had great success, won many things. I think I have a good understanding with the fans and players. I feel I still have a lot of football left in me but it is now up to the club.\u201d Chelsea have had a policy of offering one-year extensions to players in their 30s and Sarri could decide he wants to keep F\u00e0bregas. The former Arsenal and Barcelona midfielder started in the Europa League victory over Vidi on Thursday and helped to create \u00c1lvaro Morata\u2019s winning goal. However he is likely to make way for Jorginho when Chelsea visit Southampton on Sunday. \u201cI just came back from a difficult injury,\u201d F\u00e0bregas said. \u201cI\u2019m still sometimes feeling it a little bit. It is difficult to be sitting there and not helping the team when you know you could add something.\u201d F\u00e0bregas, who has won two league titles, the FA Cup and the League Cup since joining Chelsea from Barcelona in 2014, does not envisage seeing out his career in England. \u201cProbably in a few years I\u2019d like to go away from Europe and experience something different at the later stage of my career,\u201d he said. F\u00e0bregas played in a deep-lying role against Vidi and is impressed with Sarri\u2019s attacking approach. \u201cI wish he came a bit earlier to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit late now in my career.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
