Guayaquil has emerged as a regional hotspot for coronavirus, and hospitals and mortuaries have been overwhelmed, forcing some families to store bodies at home. \u201cIt looks like a war zone hospital. The things we have seen are straight out of a horror film,\u201d a doctor at the Teodoro Maldonado Carbo hospital, one of the city\u2019s biggest facilities, told the Guardian. \u201cMy wife doesn\u2019t want me to go to work. But if I don\u2019t, more patients will die.\u201d On Saturday Ecuador\u2019s health ministry said it had registered 172 Covid-19 deaths, 122 of them in Guayas province, of which Guayaquil is the capital. Low testing rates mean the true figure is almost certainly higher. Ecuador has officially registered 3,465 coronavirus cases, the third highest number in South America after Brazil and Chile. One regional politician, Carlos Luis Morales, told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol that officials had been instructed not to divulge statistics about the death toll in Guayas. But he added: \u201cJust to give you an idea, 480 death certificates have been issued since yesterday; 150 bodies are being collected each day.\u201d Ecuador\u2019s president, Len\u00edn Moreno, has said up to 3,500 people could die in Guayas in the coming weeks, while Guayaquil\u2019s city hall said on Saturday that it would hand out 2,000 cardboard coffins \u201cto offer a dignified burial to those who die during this health emergency\u201d. Jorge Wated, the official leading Guayaquil\u2019s response to the crisis, announced a WhatsApp hotline for victims. \u201cAttention: those who require the removal of the deceased from their homes can write to us on this number,\u201d he tweeted. Ecuador\u2019s government has faced criticism for its response to coronavirus and failure to effectively enforce a quarantine in Guayaquil as the infection spread. \u201cWhen the virus appeared in China, we thought it would never reach here,\u201d Morales told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. \u201cNow it\u2019s in all of us. We are breathing it. It\u2019s in the atmosphere.\u201d Ecuador\u2019s vice-president, Otto Sonnenholzner, offered a televised apology to the nation on Saturday for the gruesome images coming out of Guayaquil showing corpses dumped on pavements or outside homes. \u201cI give you my word that I am doing everything in my power to save the greatest number of lives possible,\u201d Sonnenholzner said. \u201cThis crisis isn\u2019t about left or right. Rich or poor. This virus doesn\u2019t care for religion, race or social status. All it seeks to do is spread. Its transmission risk is something never before seen by humanity.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
