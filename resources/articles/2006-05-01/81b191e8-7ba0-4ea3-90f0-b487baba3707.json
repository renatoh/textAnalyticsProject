Since graduating I've done a mixture of jobs and when I list them in an application it makes me look like I never stick at anything. In reality, they were all temporary contracts. My experience includes TEFL, call-centre work, waitressing and working as a learning adviser in an FE college. Keeping yourself going with a series of temporary jobs shows that you are both resourceful and adaptable. So, there's absolutely no need to apologise for that. If you are positive about the variety of work tackled and believe you gained something valuable from each experience it will be easy to convince potential employers likewise. You're right to feel a linear list is not the best way to present this. If you are filling in boxes on a form, put in the date from graduating until now and write \"range of temporary contracts, see additional information section\". Use the free space the final section provides to elaborate on what you have been doing and what you gained from it. Although you have had a range of employers there is a cohesion to the type of work you've done. It has all included dealing with people and there's a strong element of being persuasive and supportive. Describe your previous employment in such a way that it highlights the qualities you developed - rather than the length of time you have spent in each job. I'm concerned about funding a second degree in medicine I qualified as a dentist, but as I want to go on to a career in oral surgery, I need a medical qualification as well. I've been offered a place on a standard five-year course but am being allowed to join the second year because of my previous study. I've been told I have to pay my own fees for all but the final year and that no bursary will be available until then either. Is this right? I understood there was better funding for those doing medicine as a second degree. There are two ways for graduates to do a second degree in medicine. One is expensive and the other very expensive. The cheaper is an accelerated graduate entry course. Students on one of these four-year courses receive Department of Health bursaries for the second, third and fourth years. The course you have a place on is a standard medical degree; that you will complete it in four years does not alter that fact. Graduate students on such courses are only eligible for bursaries in the fifth year and beyond, which is why you will only receive financial help in your final year. The only way round this would be to try for an accelerated course next year. But, because of the disparity in funding, the competition for places on such courses is fierce. Is there fast-track promotion available in the police? Is there a graduate recruitment scheme for the police that means you move up the ranks quickly? Police services don't have graduate recruitment schemes as such. As a graduate you would be recruited in the normal way, but could express interest in the High Potential Development Scheme if you are applying to an English or Welsh force or the Accelerated Promotion Scheme for Graduates in Scotland. These are aimed at individuals who have the potential to become future leaders. Starters who do exceptionally well at recruit assessment centres are invited to the HPD assessment centre.
