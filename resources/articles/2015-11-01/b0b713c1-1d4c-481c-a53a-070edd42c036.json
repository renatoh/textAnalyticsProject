Deulofeu returned to Goodison Park this summer in a \u20ac6m transfer from Camp Nou having enjoyed a successful loan stay in 2013-14. The 21-year-old had found first-team opportunities understandably limited at Barcelona and also struggled to make an impact while on loan at Sevilla last season, but the Catalan club were reluctant to let the winger leave during their transfer embargo and insisted on a buy-back option lasting two years. The winger has been in fine form recently for Everton and Spain Under-21s, scoring a hat-trick against Georgia and twice against Croatia during the international break having been named captain for the European Championship qualifiers. Deulofeu\u2019s development is being closely monitored by Barcelona and it has been suggested that, even if the player does not feature in Luis Enrique\u2019s first-team plans, the Spanish champions could re-sign him with a view to selling on at a profit. But Mart\u00ednez explained: \u201cThey can\u2019t do that. There are certain things in the deal. They can\u2019t take him back in the winter so they can\u2019t take him back in January. It can only be at the end of the season. It is \u20ac9m for the first year and \u20ac12m in the second year. \u201cIf they take him back they can\u2019t sell him for a season, so he has to stay in the first-team squad for a season. At the end of that if they decide to sell him we have got first rights of getting him back or we have got a big percentage of that deal. There is nothing we can do if they activate it. That was the deal and the only way we could access the player in the terms that we wanted. I\u2019m delighted with the deal.\u201d The Everton manager insisted the complex deal and risk of losing Deulofeu after only one season is offset by having a player of that talent for \u20ac6m. \u201cMy worry would be to lose him in January, that would be a big problem,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez, who is adamant there will be no major departures from Everton in the next transfer window, a stance that applies to John Stones and Romelu Lukaku. \u201cBut for us to have a player of that quality for the money we paid, if we lose him it will be on a profit financially so we would be able to use the money. And you want the player. You\u2019re talking about a Barcelona player who has been all through his years as the golden boy believing he is going to be at the top level at Barcelona and we got him for a very good price. I\u2019d like to tell Barcelona that he\u2019s rubbish but they come to watch our games.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
