The promise and enjoyment of their first full season under Owen Coyle has long been forgotten, with this seventh defeat in eight home Premier League matches making it 12 from 15 in all. Even Wigan Athletic are climbing away from them now, and the sight of a large rat scurrying across the Reebok car park smacked of a sinking ship. Coyle had identified this game, against an Aston Villa team who had yet to win away, as the first of five December fixtures that will shape the rest of their season. But they lost it so limply that it is hard to have confidence about their prospects in any of the remaining four, at Fulham on Saturday followed quickly by a desperate derby at Blackburn Rovers before home games against Newcastle United and Wolverhampton Wanderers on Boxing Day and New Year's Eve. \"It's an absolutely crucial spell coming up now, particularly after the way we let an opportunity pass us by in recent weeks,\" the manager said. He suggested that attitude was the major problem, especially in a first half during which Villa scored twice and should have had several more. But the gulf in aptitude seemed at least as wide. Bolton have comfortably the worst defensive record in the Premier League, and it was easy to see why as they were regularly exposed by the pace of Darren Bent, Gabriel Agbonlahor and Marc Albrighton, the latter opening the scoring with his first league goal since a 3-2 defeat at Bolton last March. Then no-one picked up Stilian Petrov until it was far too late, allowing the Bulgarian to score his third of the season with a deflected shot from the edge of the penalty area. However, despite some second\u2011half huffing and puffing, Bolton were little more impressive at the other end. Ivan Klasnic scored a scrappy goal and contributed the odd classy touch to compensate for his unappealing theatrics, but he was forced off with a knee injury 10 minutes from time. Coyle could therefore be forced to start with David Ngog, an ineffectual late replacement here, alongside Kevin Davies at Fulham, where Klasnic's absence would leave a team who have scored only 11 league goals between them all season. Coyle did not duck discussion of his own position. \"The greatest pressure I am under is the pressure I place on myself. It is how I conducted myself as a player, and it is no different now I'm a manager. I was never the best player in the world, but I maximised what I had. I remember someone warning me that if I went into management, one of the biggest difficulties I would face would be that not everyone would be as passionate as me. They were right. I have tried to deal with it, but it's not easy. \"All I can say is, I come in here every day and do my very best. If someone turns round and says that's not right for this club, then fair enough. I'm very comfortable with that, because I know I'm doing everything in my power to turn things round.\" Alex McLeish clearly has far greater talent with which to work. He stressed that it is far too early to know whether the penny has dropped for Charles N'Zogbia, despite a decent performance on his recall after he had been omitted for last week's defeat by Manchester United for disciplinary reasons. But Brad Guzan shaped as a capable deputy for Shay Given, James Collins and Richard Dunne combined well in central defence, and Chris Herd played a valuable, understated role in front of them. Albrighton was the greatest bonus of all in only his second league start of the season, buzzing energetically down the right to suggest that he is ready to emerge from a self-confessed crisis of confidence. \"It has been tough mentally,\" said the 22\u2011year\u2011old, who is preparing to become a father early in the new year. \"Last season went so well but I've not reached those heights and it has been difficult. I scored at Tottenham and then this season I wasn't even on the bench. That was the worst moment. It felt like a massive step back. Hopefully I can just push on from here.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
