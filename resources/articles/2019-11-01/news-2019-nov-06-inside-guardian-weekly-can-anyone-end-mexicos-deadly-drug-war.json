The country is witnessing almost 100 drug gang-related murders every day and the battle to stop the carnage has been the bane of presidential administrations from Felipe Calder\u00f3n to Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. On his election last year, the leftwing populist Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador promised to end the long-running \u201cwar on drugs\u201dwith a pledge to battle the social roots of crime with a policy of \u201chugs not bullets\u201d. Nearly 30,000 murders later, little progress has been made and a wave of high-profile attacks have rocked Amlo\u2019s government. The Guardian has sent reporters across the country to try and make sense of the current state of Mexico\u2019s drug war. Latin America correspondent Tom Phillips witnessed a bloody week in Tijuana, while Mexican novelist Jorge Volpi laments those lost to the violence. It almost goes without saying (and we seem to say it every week) that the last seven days in British and American politics have been dramatic. Since our last edition the UK parliament confirmed Boris Johnson\u2019s plans for a general election on 12 December and the US House of Representatives voted to move into the public stage of impeachment hearings against Donald Trump. Caroline Davies heads to the PM\u2019s constituency in north-west London, where there is a chance that Johnson could become the first PM to lose his seat since Arthur Balfour in 1906. Later, Julian Borger analyses the Kafkaesque moves at the US state department, where new transcripts released by congressional committees pursuing an impeachment inquiry against Trump cast further light on his administration\u2019s dysfunction. In opinion, Simon Tisdall argues that it\u2019s surely time to throw the kitchen sink at the president. Elsewhere, as part of the Guardian\u2019s expanded reporting from New Zealand, we look at what a population of 5m will mean to the country; Moldovan writer Paula Erizanu writes on the perils of being a young lefty in eastern Europe and Hannah Ellis-Petersen tells the story of an already famous picture taken this week of water pollution in Delhi. We also include a fascinating read from Robert Macfarlane, who looks at the movement that wants to grants legal rights to natural phenomena, including rivers, lakes and mountains. While writers and authors from east Berlin and east Germany remember the Berlin Wall, 30 years after it fell. Subscribe here"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
