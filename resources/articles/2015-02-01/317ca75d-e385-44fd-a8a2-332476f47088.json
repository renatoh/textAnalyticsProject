The Manchester United manager was pleased at what was a second league victory since Boxing Day and it featured an impressive display from Adnan Januzaj. Despite being content, Van Gaal made it clear the winger has to continue to prove himself. \u201cHe has a lot of talent but you have to perform that talent in the matches. \u201cAnd also in the training sessions. I\u2019m not making the line-up, the players themselves are making the line-up. Every time you have to compare and that\u2019s also [with Darren] Fletcher, who is a very good player, but I have to compare him with [Michael] Carrick and [Daley] Blind who are playing in that position,\u201d said Van Gaal. In Januzaj\u2019s ongoing struggle to establish himself, this show of strength and willingness to shape the contest against Leicester City will do him no harm. Robin van Persie was United\u2019s star performer, scoring a peach of a right-foot volley, then starting the move from which Radamel Falcao scrambled home a fourth of the season. But Januzaj had a quietly impressive game, illustrating muscle has been added to flair, as several visiting players discovered when being held off with ease. This was only a fifth Premier League start for the Belgian handed the No11 shirt formerly worn by Ryan Giggs. If this was a sign of how United see Januzaj and where his career may go, Van Gaal is yet to be convinced. The two main charges are a lack of consistency and tentativeness, issues hardly evident when Januzaj was the best player last season in many games under David Moyes. Januzaj is also battling the sheer number of rivals for a starting berth. Given Van Gaal\u2019s view that he can be classed as a centre-forward as well as a No10 and wide player, then Wayne Rooney, Van Persie, Falcao, James Wilson, \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda, Antonio Valencia, Ashley Young and Juan Mata all vie with him for a place in the XI. In a campaign of ever-changing formations Van Gaal sent this side out with a traditional back four, Blind as a holding midfielder, and an advanced three to support Van Persie and Falcao, of which Januzaj was positioned on the left. Wes Morgan\u2019s own-goal to make it three and Marcin Wasilweski\u2019s late reply wrapped up the scoring. Afterwards Van Gaal identified Januzaj\u2019s current rival as Mata. To make his point the manager adopted a high-pitched, theatrical tone and said: \u201cI have to compare him with Mata because the next press conference you shall ask, \u2018Why? Why? Mata is not playing?\u2019 I have to choose and now I choose Januzaj. \u201cBut it\u2019s always like that \u2013 I\u2019m looking every week and every day the players have to show it. I\u2019ve said to players, I\u2019ve said to Falcao, I\u2019ve said to Mata and I\u2019ve said to Januzaj. I\u2019m very pleased that you are pleased with his performance.\u201d Van Gaal does not doubt Januzaj\u2019s talent. \u201cOtherwise he was not in Manchester [United]. I think the former manager has chosen him to play from out of the youth and he had an extension of his contract, or an improvement of his contract, so then you know that he is a Manchester United player,\u201d he said. \u201cPaddy McNair, now, is coming from out of the youth, he has extended his contract, so he is a Manchester United player.\u201d While Van Gaal would not be pushed on how Januzaj might be feeling about the lack of regular play \u2013 \u201cYou have to ask him, it\u2019s not for me\u201d \u2013 there must be a good chance he will play against Cambridge United in Tuesday\u2019s FA Cup fourth-round replay against the League Two side. Cambridge lost 3-2 at Luton Town on Saturday. Then, despite these three points that move United within five points of Manchester City, the arch-perfectionist wants more. \u201cThe results are good but I\u2019m looking always to the process and what our next step is now in that process,\u201d Van Gaal said.
