Philippe Pigeard, 51, told the Guardian he believed the attack should have been prevented by MI5 and the police, and that British authorities failed by not putting barriers in place to protect people on the bridge from a vehicle attack. His son, Alexandre, 26, was a waiter at Boro Bistro restaurant next to London Bridge on 3 June 2017, when three terrorists carried out the attack. The ringleader, Khuram Butt, had been under investigation by MI5, which failed to spot his plot and the danger he posed. Pigeard, a musician and poet from Paris, said he understood counter-terrorism investigators had a difficult job but believed they should have done better. He said he found their evidence to the inquest into the deaths of eight people during the attack unconvincing and \u201cfrustrating\u201d, because the security services were certain they had not made mistakes. The inquest heard Butt\u2019s brother-in-law rang the police because he was so concerned about his Islamist extremism, but nothing was done and the information was mishandled. Pigeard said: \u201cDespite the warnings, the direct warnings, with calls from relatives of Butt, they did not put more pressure on the guy \u2026 Many of Butt\u2019s actions are unknown by the investigators, even though they were supposed to have him under investigation. \u201cThe question is: could this attack have been prevented? The answer is really difficult \u2013 but yes, probably. I think they could have done a better job.\u201d Pigeard criticised an MI5 witness known only as \u201cL\u201d, who testified at the inquest, and said: \u201cIt was very frustrating when I listened to witness L. I was irritated by the way he talks, he was very aggressive, we were 3 metres away. He was so sure of himself and so proud of what they had done. \u201cWhen he was questioned \u2026 there was not a moment when he said things could have been better. All he said was they had done the best job possible. I don\u2019t think so \u2013 too many failings.\u201d Pigeard said the March 2017 attack on Westminster Bridge, in which a car was driven into pedestrians, should have led authorities to do more to protect London Bridge. \u201cFirst Westminster, three months before \u2013 where were the barriers on [London] Bridge? If there were barriers on the bridge then [there would have been] no attacks in that area. \u201cI still don\u2019t know who is responsible for the decision not to put barriers on the bridge.\u201d Pigeard said of the impact on relatives of the victims: \u201cIf you add all the parents, it is a lot of people. My life is destroyed, for the last two years, it is stopped. It is a long night, I am obsessed.\u201d Alexandre Pigeard ran to help others after the van driven by the terrorists crashed into railings above the courtyard of the restaurant where he worked. His father said: \u201cI still shout in my sleep when I manage to sleep, I still shout no, as to tell him not to go. When he heard the bang in the restaurant, he rushed to the place where the crash was, because he wanted to help.\u201d \u201cIt is a matter of seconds. He could have been in another place in the restaurant and not hear[d] the bang.\u201d He said his son\u2019s nine months in London\u2019s were the happiest of his adult life. Alexandre Pigeard was a music producer and DJ who loved the clubs and parties London had to offer. His father said he last spoke to him hours before his death. The two chatted on FaceTime while Alexandre Pigeard had a break from his job as a waiter and ate a quick meal. They talked about their shared passion for music. Pigeard praised the thoroughness of the inquest, which examined the attacks and the run-up to them in minute detail. When Pigeard saw news of the attack, he desperately called and messaged his son. He began to fear the worst when he received no reply, more so as his son had messaged to say he was safe after the Westminster Bridge attack. Pigeard, who has attended most of the seven weeks of the inquest, has said he is \u201cobsessed\u201d by the hatred of the attackers and the events that led to the killing of his son. Imagining his son\u2019s final moments, Pigeard said: \u201cWhat was the last picture in the eye of Alexandre \u2026 what was the last sound in his ear?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
