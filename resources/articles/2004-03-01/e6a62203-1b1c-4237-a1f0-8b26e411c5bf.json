Deportivo shocked the Italians when they took an early lead through Walter Pandiani, but then the Italian club equalised on the stroke of the interval through Kaka. When the match resumed after the break, Milan took a firm grip on proceedings with three goals in the first eight minutes of the second period through Andrei Shevchenko, Kaka again and then Andrea Pirlo on target. Milan could have added three times to their lead had not the assistant referee called Shevchenko offside and twice flagged against substitute Jon Dahl Tomasson. In all three occasions the official looked to have got it wrong. In the night's other game, Porto moved a step closer to a place in the semi-finals with a comfortable 2-0 win over Lyon. Deco was the star of the show for the Portuguese side, who knocked out Manchester United in the last round. He scored the first before creating the second for Ricardo Carvalho to leave Lyon with an uphill task in the return leg on April 7."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
