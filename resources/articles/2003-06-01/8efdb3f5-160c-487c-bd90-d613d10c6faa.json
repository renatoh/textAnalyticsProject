Telephone: 0131-525 8200. Website: theetoncollection.com. First Impressions: Edinburgh's latest hotel is a bijou Gothic castello skewered by gigantic runaway ice tray two minutes from the east end of Princes Street. The Eton Group have spent \u00a37m grafting a 65-bedrooom boutique hotel on to a cinema complex and the stained sandstone facade of the 150-year-old Lady Glenorchy Church. Scarlet and gold station clock hanging from the battlements feeds the air of Ruritanian fantasy. Inside, the feel is 1950s cool: right-angles, high backs, stained Honduran mahogany, chocolate 'n' mustard tones, enough chrome to clothe a battleship. Porters are draped in black aprons, chambermaids wear pleated dresses with shoulder puffs and demure white aprons. Reception's three stainless steel candleabra and ornate ceiling tiles are a homage to the building's origins. Slabs of modern art reassure you that this is, indeed, the 21st century. What are the rooms like? Parquet flooring, cannonball-sized paperweights, L-shaped settees, electronic trinkets including portable telephones and screen-mounted, swivelling (in suites) TVs. Suites have balconies that could stage table-tennis tournaments; on the north side, sybarites can contemplate St Mary's cathedral's injunction to 'Walk Humbly'. The bathroom: Heated floors and mirrors. Atmosphere is provided by monochrome studies of soft-focus nudes with a curious proclivity for being shrink-wrapped; a subliminal reference to the Scottish weather? Just another headache-inducing urban style ghetto? No. The unexpected two-acre roof garden with arched timber pergola, raised beds of porcupine heather plants, lawns framed by ash trees, conveniently-glued shingle and view on to the more chaotic forestry of Calton Hill is a superb nerve-soothing coup de theatre. The restaurant: Only for breakfasts: \u00a316.50 (cooked), \u00a313.50 (continental). How much? De luxe double room from \u00a3175; suites range from \u00a3225 to \u00a3375 a night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
