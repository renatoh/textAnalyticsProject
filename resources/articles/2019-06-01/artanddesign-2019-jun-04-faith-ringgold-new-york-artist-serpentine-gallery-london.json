Ringgold lived around the corner from the campus in Harlem, and used to \u201csee the boys coming out of the subway and going up the hill to the college\u201d. It had never occurred to her that they were all white, and that it was a men-only college. When the bemused college administrators informed her she wouldn\u2019t be able to attend, Ringgold refused to budge. She wasn\u2019t taking a stand, she just didn\u2019t understand why they were telling her she couldn\u2019t do art. \u201cArt is what I wanted to do,\u201d she says matter-of-factly. \u201cAs a child you think you have the freedom to do what you want. You learn later in life that maybe you\u2019re not supposed to do this or that. Then, hopefully, you realise that you can try.\u201d Eventually, a college official helped her sort out a compromise. Women were allowed to teach \u2013 that was acceptable; she could get an art degree as long as she minored in education at the college\u2019s teaching institute. She was in, but it wasn\u2019t exactly a breeze from there: she experienced racism and several teachers tried to discourage her. But she never doubted her ability: \u201cSorry, but I\u2019m here. And I\u2019m going to be here. And you better know it.\u201d Ringgold has certainly made good on her words. The 88-year-old isn\u2019t just a successful artist: she\u2019s an author, activist and cultural icon. Her career has been prolific and diverse; she\u2019s worked across 16 different media. A survey of her work spanning 50 years is about to open at the Serpentine in London, her first in a European arts institution. I\u2019m chatting to Ringgold at ACA, the New York gallery that has been representing her since 1995. We\u2019re sitting in leather armchairs next to Tar Beach #2, one of her signature \u201cstory quilts\u201d. She turned to quilting out of necessity. She enjoyed sculpting in wood and clay but the dust provoked her asthma, so she started experimenting with \u201csoft sculpture\u201d, combining fabric, painting and narrative. She produced her first such work, Echoes of Harlem, in 1980 in collaboration with her mother, Willi Posey Jones, a fashion designer. Quilts were practical for other reasons. Ringgold, a vocal feminist, didn\u2019t want to rely on her husband to help her carry her work to a gallery \u2013 \u201cThat ain\u2019t right!\u201d However large her latest piece, she could just roll it up and take it wherever she needed. Quilts also became a stealthy means of getting her own story out there. \u201cI have always wanted to tell my story or, more to the point, my side of the story,\u201d Ringgold writes in the preface to her memoir, We Flew Over the Bridge, which was published in 1995. Her first autobiography, completed in 1980, was met with a string of rejections. \u201cIt was then that I hit on the strategy of self-publication through masked performance pieces and readings of my story quilts at college lecture dates and exhibitions,\u201d she explains in her book. For a long time, quilts have been both a utilitarian and subversive medium. \u201cIt was an art form that slaves used to keep themselves warm and to also import their art because they couldn\u2019t bring the art forms that they practised in Africa,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThis was a way of them being able to continue their art in a way that was acceptable to the slavers because it was keeping them warm.\u201d Tar Beach #2 is one of a number of story quilts in Ringgold\u2019s Woman on a Bridge series, named after the tar rooftops of the apartment buildings in Harlem where people used to go to cool off on a hot day. Ringgold was a child during the Harlem renaissance; artists and musicians such as Jacob Lawrence, Duke Ellington and Aaron Douglas lived around the corner from her family. \u201cThere was excitement and festiveness\u201d in the air, she says. People would gather on the roofs and tell stories: \u201cI guess that\u2019s why I became a storyteller, because I heard so many stories.\u201d Another of Ringgold\u2019s story quilts, Coming to Jones Road #6: Baby Freedom Came One Night, is hanging nearby. The series was partly inspired by Ringgold\u2019s experience of moving to a house in New Jersey in the 90s. She\u2019d bought the property from another artist and planned to build a studio, but the neighbours weren\u2019t keen on a black neighbour and took her to court. \u201cThe neighbours figured, \u2018If we keep her from building this studio, she\u2019ll go. We\u2019ll stall her, and eventually she\u2019ll leave.\u2019 But they didn\u2019t know: I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d In Coming to Jones Road Part 1, Ringgold tells the story by harking back to the experience of runaway slaves migrating to the north. \u201cOut of every awful thing is something beautiful,\u201d she says. \u201cAs an artist I want to see the beauty, especially in situations that I can\u2019t change and that are so prevalent.\u201d Ringgold is adept at presenting ugly themes in beautiful ways. There have been times when people have spectacularly missed those layers. In 1970, just after her second solo show in New York, Ringgold caught the attention of David Rockefeller, the chief executive of Chase Manhattan bank. He sent a couple of representatives to buy a piece to hang in the bank. They walked past the pieces that looked too obviously political and then stood approvingly in front of a piece featuring the American flag. \u201cThe flag, very patriotic. Yeah, let\u2019s get it,\u201d she remembers the woman saying. \u201cAnd then the guy says to the woman, \u2018But did you read it?\u2019 The woman began to read the letters in the star section of the flag. \u201cD-I-E.\u201d That was fine. Edgy but fine. \u201cYeah, but put your head to the side, to the left side, and read,\u201d Ringgold told them. \u201cOK, hold on. \u2018N-I-G-G ...\u2019 Oh. Oh my goodness.\u201d The pair ran out of the door and did not buy the piece: Flag for the Moon, Die Nigger, 1969. (Eventually they returned and bought a more palatable piece called Black Light #9: American Spectrum, which is in the Serpentine show). Ringgold has lived through momentous political and cultural change. Is any of her current work addressing Donald Trump? \u201cOh my God,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cYou had to bring him in! Well, I\u2019ve started a series on him: Trump the Chump. I\u2019ve done lots of sketches on him. And I\u2019m gonna come up with some paintings shortly. He is something, he really is.\u201d The Trump sketches are just a diversion, a form of art therapy, rather than a real project at the moment. Ringgold\u2019s current focus is a series about ageing called Aging-aling-aling. All over the world people are living longer and longer, she notes, and this series will be an exploration of our elongated lives. While she may be nearing 90, age hasn\u2019t slowed her down much. She still gets up early and heads to her studio to paint every morning. \u201cI want to get that work done,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t stop until it is done.\u201d \u2022 Faith Ringgold is at the Serpentine Gallery, London, 8 June to 8 September.
