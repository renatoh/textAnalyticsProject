Sadly, it was also an accurate one. With the exception of Goldie Sayers, who just missed out on an Olympic medal in the javelin last summer, a dire lack of talent, expertise and investment is threatening to end a great British tradition of international throwing success. That realisation may come as a shock after the myriad talents of Olympic medallists Tessa Sanderson, Fatima Whitbread and Steve Backley in the javelin. There was a time when Britain confidently made finals and won medals in the throws. But not a single male thrower travelled to compete in Beijing last year and only Sayers made an Olympic final, underlining the desperate need to improve the discipline. With Backley's retirement five years ago the golden era is decidedly dead and gone. As the former world record holder says: \"It is devastating.\" The former greats of the sport are in agreement: something needs to be done, and fast. \"Van Commenee is absolutely right,\" says Sanderson, the only British thrower to win an Olympic gold medal in 25 years. \"But he needs to look at the whole system and see why it is appalling. You have to make sure you don't put throws at the bottom of the list just because it's appalling.\" Sanderson laments that her own expertise is not being utilised by the governing body. \"I've been in athletics for 40 years, the governing body, they've probably asked me once to do something, maybe twice, to give my input on a training weekend. I think that's shocking.\" Even when Sanderson directly offered to help, her attempts fell on deaf ears. Watching heptathlete Kelly Sotherton struggling with her weakest event \u2013 the javelin \u2013 Sanderson called UK Athletics. \"I thought, 'Every time I watch you throw I cringe, and I can help you'. I called the governing body and tried to get a message to Kelly. I said, 'Listen, come up to Newham, we'll have a girls' weekend just doing some throws'. I did see Kelly once very briefly, but I never heard a thing again after that. If an Olympic gold medallist is offering to help, you don't turn it down do you? When I started doing heptathlon, Daley Thompson said, 'Come, I'll show you how to high jump', and I went up to Haringey and he helped me. But I never heard anything back, so why bother?\" But if expertise at the elite end is not being made use of, Backley is even more concerned by what is happening at grassroots level. \"When I speak to people of my age, every one of them will go, 'Oh, I threw a javelin at school', they might have even thrown a hammer, and a discus. But kids nowadays don't have those opportunities.\" Backley says schools don't have the facilities or know-how to deal with the health and safety issues particular to throws, to offer children the opportunity to try those events. Sayers, the brightest exception to the gloomy landscape, believes that even when children are offered the option, outdated ideas about the kind of physique they should have is threatening the sport's talent pool. \"PE teachers see the big kids and think they can have a go at throws, when as a sport we'd be better off if all the sprinters and jumpers had a go.\" The British record holder, who threw a personal best of 65.75m to finish in fourth place in Beijing, says the idea of children needing to be giants is a misconception. \"I've seen Mo Farah [the European indoor 3,000m gold medallist] with a javelin in his hand and he's bloody good. The main thing is athleticism and movement, it's a coordination type event.\" Backley says the children who do prove talented as juniors are too often lured away by other, more high-profile sports. \"Our heavy throws are stifled because young, strong lads go and play rugby, and rugby is very proactive in searching out that talent. Throwing is hard, fairly lonely in comparison, there's no camaraderie, so it's not necessarily an attractive or easy option.\" So while other sports wade in with a heavy recruitment drive, throwing is lagging behind, and suffering the consequences. \"Throwing is not being marketed as a sport in its own right,\" adds Backley. \"That's the only reason it's failing. Other countries have proved that. In Germany the field and the track have an equal bearing. I've been in a stadium in Finland where the javelin would finish, with the 800m and relay still to go, and the crowd leaves the stadium. In this country that would never happen, we're very track focused.\" Sayers worries that the problems are structural. \"We haven't got a performance director for javelin now, UKA need to look at that. I've done my best, but that's just through being driven. I probably learned more in Finland than I ever did here if I'm honest . I'm lucky enough that I can pick up the phone to Steve Backley. We have got the knowledge in this country, UKA just needs to engage with people again.\" The 27-year-old says she is \"not completely positive about the future\", but remains excited by the talent she comes across at junior competitions. \"There's definitely a lot of younger girls throwing further than I did at my age \u2013 with the new specification javelin which is harder to throw. The problem with throws is you can get stuck at a certain distance and unless you have very experienced coaches it's very difficult to get past that. \"I see kids in schools all the time who could be way better than me if they worked hard and persevered. But you need decent coaches, talent only gets you so far. We need to change the attitude of, 'we'll help you out when you get there', to, 'we'll help you to get there'.\" Sayers has offered to help out with the coaching, \"but I've always been told to just concentrate on myself\". The young talent coming through the system could just be the saving of the sport. Backley points to teenagers Daniel Pembroke and Ashley Bryant in the javelin \u2013 \"two of the best we've seen in a long, long time\" \u2013 and this summer there have been multiple medals in the European Under-23s. Francis Eden won gold in the discus with Jade Nicholls taking bronze, while Sarah Holt took bronze in the hammer. The question now is whether that talent can be retained and shaped to emerge on the world stage as promising seniors. Happily, Van Commenee's appointment last year has injected a new urgency into the sport. The Dutchman's first recruit to his staff was a leading US throws coach, the British-born double Commonwealth gold medallist, Bob Weir. A throws centre of excellence is also planned, as part of the national high performance centre in Loughborough, and is due to open next spring. Weir, who guided Adam Nelson to an Olympic silver medal in the shot put in 2000, feels positive about how the sport can improve in the UK. \"Where I've been working, with arguably the best team in athletics in the world, the attitude is 'can do', not 'we can't'. It's very positive. If you want things to work and get better, you might prepare for the worst but you look at things with optimism. \"The athletes over here are every bit as talented as in the US. What is needed now is the right pathway for them to become successful. A lot can be done in time for 2012, but it's about getting them throwing the A-standard on a regular basis \u2013 then we can start talking about getting people into finals.\" Kevin Tyler is the new head of coaching and development that will oversee the strategy for the sport. The Canadian former winter Olympian says that throws have struggled more than any other discipline as a result of poor investment in British coaching over the past decade. \"You always start to see the technical events suffer first.\" But will 2012 come too soon for any major improvement to the sport? \"In 2012 the goals for the throwers will be different to the other events,\" Tyler concedes. \"We had one finalist in Beijing so we'd like to increase that number.\" Sanderson, though, remains unconvinced. \"It doesn't seem that the governing body are doing enough, throwers are still suffering. Now they've got Bob Weir it will do a little bit of good, but I still think throwers are looked on as not the blue-ribbon event. That's crazy. It's wonderful to see the javelin leave your arm, fly through the air. It's a beautiful sound as it moves through the air. \"Give me the women and I'll do it. I'm always prepared to help. It's not just about money, but money is an issue. Gone are the days that you spend hours working for nothing. But if we don't do something quick we'll be in a terrible state come 2012.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
