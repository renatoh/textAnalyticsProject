Perhaps she burns the midnight oil poring over her books before falling into a fitful sleep. Or maybe he sits at the computer \"working\" while downloading his favourite music and telling you not to worry because he's on top of it. Most probably it's somewhere between, but if you have a teenager, you and everyone else in your household will know that The Exams are here. With such high stakes now riding on the results, it can be a time of acute stress. Last week psychologists at Coventry University reported that more than half of the A-level students interviewed for a research study found exams very or extremely stressful and many reported loss of sleep and appetite, headaches and nausea and a tendency to binge on food and drink. There is plenty of parenting advice out there on how to handle it all with as little fuss as possible. It seems to boil down to keeping the fruit bowl full, the kettle on and the sympathy fully charged. But everyone is different - parent and child - and how you support your teenager depends to a large extent on the relationship you already have with him or her. If it's good, then that's a start, but even so don't expect a smooth ride; if it's not good, this is the time to put irritations about the size of the mobile phone bill or the rotten homework grades to one side. Whatever the quality of the relationship, you as the parent should know this kid better than anyone else and can offer the kind of support that is appropriate to them. Over-anxious teenagers need to be encouraged to get things into perspective. They need to see their friends and family and get some exercise - well, they all do, but it's even more important to encourage the ones who feel they will fail if they spend one night at the pictures. The too-laid-back teenager needs to be told - not nagged - that he is in danger of not reaching his potential, which would be a shame. They all need regular meals and, if they are having trouble sleeping, it's good to remember that a 20-minute power nap in the afternoon is as good as two hours' sleep a night. If they have regular jobs round the house, give them a break from those; even do their paper round, if you can face it. A bit of pampering at a difficult time never hurt anyone. With some sleep, decent food, exercise and social time it will be a lot easier to keep calm and do their best. Linda Blair, a clinical psychologist based at Bath University, who is an expert on exam stress, says if they ask for help, give it, but don't keep proffering it or quizzing them on how they are doing. \"It drives them crazy,\" she says. And don't minimise their problems and anxieties. \"If they say they can't do it, don't jolly them along and say it will be all right on the night. That makes them feel they don't understand their own feelings because Mum or Dad is saying it's all right,\" she says. Be realistic about their chances of success and get help from their teacher if they really don't understand something. The odd bout of tears or irritable snappiness is one thing, but feelings of real hopelessness should involve a visit to the GP. Eight per cent of those students interviewed for the Coventry study reported having suicidal thoughts brought on by the stress of exams. And don't forget, they might look big on the outside, but they are still little on the inside. The latest neurological, biochemical and psychological findings suggest that the teenage brain is in a similar state of flux to that of a five-year-old. Maturity doesn't begin to kick in until around the age of 17. Just remember that, and count to 10 slowly whenever you need to over the next few weeks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
