And it is not only made up of elected politicians. Over the last two decades they have been joined in Westminster by an ever-expanding band of special advisers, party professionals and lobbyists. The growing professionalism of British politics, the massive expansion in news media and the increasing desire among businesses and in the voluntary sector to influence government have all contributed to its growth. And like other classes, becoming a member can be tough. The director of Kingston's new MA, the former head of Downing Street's corporate communications, James Humphreys, believes it is wrong to dismiss political communications as \"spin\". \"It is the reality of the way politics and public policy are now conducted. Everyone is competing for public opinion - government, businesses, campaigning groups, even the media themselves. \"It's a hard game,\" he concludes. \"If you don't understand the rules and don't have the right skills, your voice will be drowned out.\" A hard game? Maybe. But it has made life a lot easier for those who have had a misspent childhood posting political leaflets and pouring over political biographies. Though I blush now to admit it, I was such a youth. And whereas 25 years ago those I would have met along the way - in my student union, at party conferences and in the Commons' canteens - would have had to go off and get a \"proper\" job after graduation, or a short, poorly-paid stint working for an MP, they can now go on to make a mint working as a lobbyist. Nick Jones, the former BBC political correspondent and author of \"Control Freaks\", has met many about to embark on this new career path. \"What amazes me is how students who have shadowed me in the past - to learn about the work of a political journalist - have had such a meteoric rise since that they're now earning \u00a3100,000 a year. \"There now seems to be a whole career ladder, where you can start off stuffing envelopes for an MP, go and work for a party, become a researcher on a BBC political programme and then land a highly paid job at a lobbying company. It shows the interface between the media and politics can be very lucrative.\" Mr Jones regrets this development, but for Ed Vaizey, who heads the public affairs (or lobbying) arm of one of Britain's biggest PR companies, it is no bad thing. Having qualified as a barrister after a stint at the Conservative party's research department, he sees parallels between his past and present professions. \"As the media and government have become more sophisticated, they've become more and more like the legal world. Whereas justice is suppose to be for all, you in fact need a barrister to guide you through all the procedure and precedents of the law. And you now need an expert to guide you through the complicated world of Westminster too.\" One of the men behind Kingston's new course, Professor Brian Brivati, sees it as a means to open up the political class to people who have not spent their youth hacking around a political party. \"This MA recognises that there is a new politics profession developing in Britain, but one with a real skills shortage. This creates a 'spin divide' between those who can get their message across to government and those who can't. We want to close that divide by providing the professional qualification the new political class needs.\" The course will be open to up to 25 people a year, with entrants particularly encouraged from the voluntary sector. And, with Alastair Campbell already having promised to come and speak, it should be popular. Whereas to Mr Jones the prime minister's spin doctor is the bogeyman, he has found he is a hero to many students. \"When I go and speak to politics students now they don't see Alastair Campbell as an ogre, instead they view him as a role model. In fact, some of them ask me how they can become like him.\" Now they have the opportunity to find out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
