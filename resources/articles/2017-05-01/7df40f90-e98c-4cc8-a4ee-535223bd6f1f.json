Victory against West Bromwich Albion would secure the Premier League at the first attempt under Conte\u2019s stewardship, with an appeareance in the FA Cup final still to come. The manager has two years to run on his \u00a36.5m-a-season deal but Chelsea are expected to offer him improved terms following the team\u2019s startling success this term. Those negotiations will play out with Inter, under the money-flushed ownership of Suning Holdings group, having this week sacked their head coach, Stefano Pioli after only six months in charge. Their Chinese backers have prioritised Conte as a replacement and the Italian, asked to offer definitive assurances he would lead Chelsea into a Champions League campaign next season, was equivocal. \u201cI have a contract for another two years with Chelsea but, for me and my players, the important thing is to be focused on the present,\u201d Conte said. \u201cThis moment is very important. The future is not important for any single person: me or the players. It\u2019s normal to have a lot of speculation around players and coaches, so it\u2019s important not to lose the concentration and be focused as we try to reach this fantastic target. \u201cIt\u2019s logical that, when you start in a new club, the will is to continue and improve your work for many years. For sure this is my will. But now the most important thing is to reach our target. To arrive at this moment, in this position, to have this great opportunity \u2026 we worked very hard for the whole season [for this]. Now it\u2019s important to be ready and to try to do this step, to win and then to celebrate together.\u201d Conte earns significantly less than Pep Guardiola, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho or Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, managers whose teams he has eclipsed comfortably this season. The scope is there to use Inter\u2019s interest as a means of securing far better terms. Yet he suggested that, at such an elite level, the salary itself is less of a priority other than providing an indication of the worth a club places in his services. \u201cThe most important thing is to win, not the money,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what the money does explain is your value; the real value of a player or a coach. If you show you deserve it, then you have earned [your] money. \u201cIf, in the future, we decide to extend my contract, then we\u2019ll decide this. But it\u2019s not important, this. I have two more years of contract and, I repeat, it\u2019s important to win and write the history of this club with my players. Money is important but it\u2019s not everything.\u201d Conte has pointed to the confidence his players gained from an impressive second half comeback at Manchester City in early December as key to Chelsea\u2019s anticipated title success as the leaders seek to secure the Premier League ahead of the weekend. A win at West Bromwich Albion on Friday would be enough to claim the trophy for the fifth time under Roman Abramovich\u2019s ownership, and exorcise the memories of last season\u2019s mid-table under-achievement. Chelsea had finished 10th under Mourinho and the interim management of Guus Hiddink, their lowest placing since the oligarch purchased the club in 2003, to suggest Conte had taken on a daunting task. Indeed, even after winning his first three games in charge, he was unconvinced they would boast enough to mount a challenge back in the autumn. Those concerns became more acute after successive league defeats to Liverpool and Arsenal in September. \u201cWe started this season with three wins but, honestly, I wasn\u2019t tranquillo. I wasn\u2019t calm,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see what I was wanting to see. After three wins and a draw, you can lose one game like Liverpool, but a bad defeat against Arsenal ... after that defeat [3-0 at the Emirates], I understood we had to change something and find the right solution. We had to improve our tactical work. But, after that, I saw my team improving game by game, increasing their confidence in the work. In what we were doing.\u201d He added: \u201cIf you ask me for one [definitive] moment when I knew we could compete for the title, I didn\u2019t see one. But I saw my team improving, step by step and, for sure, when you play against City and win the way we did, confidence improved from then on.\u201d Chelsea, having adopted the manager\u2019s 3-4-3 formation after the Arsenal loss, had trailed 1-0 to Pep Guardiola\u2019s much fancied side at the Etihad Stadium with their former player, Kevin de Bruyne, then missing a glorious chance to double the hosts\u2019 lead. That proved pivotal with Diego Costa, Willian and Eden Hazard scoring in the last half-our to claim the points. Conte also acknowledged the part the emphatic 4-0 win over Mourinho\u2019s Manchester United, back in late October, had played in convincing his players his methods would yield results. \u201cAlso the draw at Liverpool in January, when we missed a penalty 10 minutes from the end,\u201d he said. \u201cThe confidence had improved a lot. These are moments when you understand you can fight for the title. But to win it in the first season? That\u2019s difficult, and we are not there yet. We are building good foundations for this team at a transitional moment when we are losing players who wrote the history for this club. To build those foundations you need time.\u201d Chelsea\u2019s players trained at Stamford Bridge before travelling to the Midlands ahead of the game at the Hawthorns with three points required from their three remaining fixtures to confirm their status as champions. Conte has always stressed their success this term \u2013 they will play the FA Cup final against Arsenal later this month \u2013 is born of incessant work on the training ground. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to win this title without suffering,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen you work very hard, it\u2019s normal to suffer. I\u2019ve never seen a player who, during hard work, doesn\u2019t suffer. I think that when you suffer you become stronger and then you are ready to face every situation, above all problematic situations during games. \u201cThis season, above all at the start, was not easy. We faced a lot of problems. When you arrive at a club who finished 10th in the league, it means that there was not only one problem, but lots of problems. So we tried to solve them \u2013 with my players, my staff and the club \u2013 and to find the right solution to change the situation created last season. My players and staff worked so hard to change this, so I have to thank them. But, above all, when I arrived here I found my players were great men, first of all, and also really good players. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to adapt to new methods or philosophies, and training very hard to change totally the work when you compare it to the work in the past. I think we\u2019ve done a really good job. But I want this job to become great and fantastic because we have two really good opportunities, in the league and the FA Cup, to finish this season the right way.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
