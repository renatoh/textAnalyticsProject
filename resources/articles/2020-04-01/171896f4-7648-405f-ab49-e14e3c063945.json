The Covid-19 outbreak began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, but has spread globally and by Saturday evening had killed more people in America, nearly 20,000, than in any other country. White House public health experts have said they currently expect a death toll of around 60,000 in the United States. On Saturday, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a foreign policy hardliner, wrote on Twitter: \u201cSince I first learned of the Wuhan coronavirus in mid-January, common sense has been my guide. \u201cNot Chinese communist lies. Not \u2018the models\u2019. Not so-called \u2018public-health experts\u2019. Just common sense. Many elected leaders have also been guided by common sense. Others haven\u2019t.\u201d The virus is believed to have originated in a market in Wuhan in which wild animals were sold. But in an appearance on Fox News in February, Cotton floated a conspiracy theory which suggests the virus was manufactured in a Chinese bioweapons facility. \u201cHere\u2019s what we do know,\u201d he said. \u201cThe virus did not originate in the Wuhan animal market. Epidemiologists \u2026 have demonstrated that several of the original cases did not have any contact with that food market. That the virus went into that food market before it came out of that food market. \u201cSo we don\u2019t know where it originated. But we do know that we have to get to the bottom of that. We also know that just a few miles away from that food market is China\u2019s only biosafety level four super-laboratory, that researches human infectious diseases. \u201cWe don\u2019t have evidence that this disease originated there but because of China\u2019s duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning, we need to at least ask the question to see what the evidence says, and China right now is not giving evidence on that question at all.\u201d The Chinese ambassador to the US censured Cotton following his remarks on Fox and said the senator\u2019s floating of the conspiracy theory was \u201cabsolutely crazy\u201d. The senator walked back on the issue shortly afterwards and said the theory was one of \u201cat least four hypotheses about the origin of the virus\u201d. But Cotton, other leading Trump allies and the president himself have continued to refer to Covid-19 as the Wuhan or Chinese virus, denying that it is racist or discriminatory to do so. On Saturday, Texas senator Ted Cruz was among prominent figures to defend Bill Maher, after the comedian condemned protests against naming the virus with reference to China. Critics of Maher pointed out that Asian Americans have faced abuse and attacks since the virus took hold in the US. More than 500,000 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in the US, with New York, New Jersey and Michigan worst hit. Together, the three states account for more than 10,000 deaths. On Saturday, Cotton also took aim at Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, regarding a stay-at-home order which deemed garden centers to be non-essential businesses. \u201cI get that Governor Whitmer is auditioning to be [vice-president],\u201d Cotton wrote on Twitter. \u201cFoolish, theatrical orders with no public-health benefits may generate headlines, but they undermine public confidence. Then again, Joe Biden called the China travel ban \u2018xenophobic\u2019. So maybe those two are a good match.\u201d In fact, though Trump placed restrictions on travel from China \u2013 which Biden now backs \u2013 he did not ban such travel entirely. The World Health Organization has cautioned against travel restrictions, saying they can be counterproductive. Research indicates the virus mainly came to the US from Europe, not China. Nonetheless, on Saturday Cotton also tweeted an opinion piece entitled: \u201cTime to put China on lockdown for its dishonesty.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
