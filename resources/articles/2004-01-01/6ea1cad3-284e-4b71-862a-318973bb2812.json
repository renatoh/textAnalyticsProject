All embarrassment ended there. \"This is about doing ourselves justice,\" said the Telford striker, his composure restored and focus honed on Saturday's third-round FA Cup tie at Crewe. \"But football can be cruel sometimes.\" Mills, more than most, is painfully aware of that. Exactly a year ago the forward, twice transferred for \u00a31m in a career spanning eight league clubs, trotted out at Selhurst Park with his Coventry team-mates on the fringe of the play-offs and promotion to the Premiership a realistic ambition. This afternoon he will be at The Lawn, aiming to undermine Forest Green Rovers in the hope of a return to the Football League. At first glance the plummet from First Division to non-league appears staggering, yet the 33-year-old can recall precisely when the downturn began. On March 15 last year, a month after joining Stoke City permanently, he was driving home to Stafford along the M6 following a goalless draw with Sheffield United when the car he was following swerved to avoid a vehicle parked in the outside lane. Mills was not so lucky. \"The lady's car had broken down but it was pitch black and I ploughed into her at 70mph,\" he recalled. \"She was in the car and ended up in intensive care. My lease car was a write-off and my body took a battering too - chest, ribs, neck and facial injuries, general whiplash - and it affected my hips so I couldn't run. \"For two months I was all over the place, both mentally and physically. The first time I drove in to training for rehab I couldn't go over 30mph in the slow lane. My contract was up in the summer and the manager Tony Pulis didn't think I'd be the same player after the accident. If he'd offered me a contract, I wouldn't have signed because I'd made up my mind to quit. \"Then Telford offered me a two-year deal. I persuaded them to cut that to 12 months - if I was an absolute disgrace and my body wasn't up to it, there was no point hanging on for the sake of it, particularly as there are so many players out of work. But it's been good. It's a hell of a drop from the First Division but, if it had been a non-league set-up, I wouldn't have come here. It isn't.\" Telford, fresh from their dismissal of Second Division Brentford in the second round, are a club geared for league football. Last season Jake King's side toiled to stay in the Conference, resources stretched with the bench occasionally boasting only two substitutes. Now, with a new manager in Mick Jones and the chairman Andy Shaw's ambitions close to realisation, the Bucks Head is a sparkling, rebuilt arena. The transition from part-time to professional status has been negotiated with only one player retained from last season. \"Back in the summer nobody knew each other's name,\" said Mills, one of four in the squad - the ex-Bolton defender Scott Green, the former QPR full-back Trevor Challis and Fitzroy Simpson, once of Manchester City - with top-flight experience. \"It's not just at Chelsea where that happens. Everything is brand new, from the stadium to the manager to all the players. It was hard to take it all in but we're getting there now.\" The trip to Crewe will provide an indication of how far the club, currently 11th in the Conference, have come. Mills, for his part, is flourishing. There have been 10 goals in 27 games to revive memories of the form which, only five years ago, propelled Bradford into the Premiership. His partnership with Robbie Blake, now with First Division Burnley, produced 39 of City's 82 league goals in 1998-99 to provide the highlight of the 6ft 1in striker's career. \"Paul Jewell gambled and spent about \u00a35m on six of us, but to finish second was the stuff of dreams,\" said Mills. \"The last-day victory at Wolves, one of my former clubs, was unbelievable. Even then I was still pinching myself. I was playing at Stocksbridge and working for Barnsley Council, training to be an accountant, when I got my window of opportunity. Wal sall offered me a trial back in 1992 and I scored a hat-trick against Wrexham reserves in a 3-3 draw only for the Wolves scout Ron Jukes [now with Telford] to urge Graham Turner to sign me. \"My experience of a nine-to-five 'proper' job made me appreciate football. I went from pushing pens to scoring for Wolves in an FA Cup tie at Ipswich within six months. I haven't done too badly for myself since, playing for Derby, Coventry, Pompey and City. God knows why they all wanted to sign me. \"I'm an old-fashioned centre-forward but I've always needed to play alongside someone who can make me look better. At Bradford, alongside Rob Steiner, we looked hopeless together; I was at Portsmouth with Lee Bradbury and we'd both instinctively run down the same channels. Alongside clever players like Robbie or Tony Naylor [at Port Vale and Telford], my game clicked. \"Hopefully I can show that at Gresty Road. In the grand scheme of things the match against Forest Green is more important than Crewe. We're not going to win the FA Cup but we have aspirations to be promoted. But it'll still be an occasion against [the] Alex. After all, I thought I'd never play First Division opponents again.\" It should be like old times."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
