Moore took to Facebook to clarify his position after reports suggested he was explicitly attacking Eastwood\u2019s movie, which smashed records with a gargantuan $105m in North America over the four-day Martin Luther King Jr weekend. Moore had tweeted: \u201cMy uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren\u2019t heroes. And invaders r worse.\u201d However, yesterday he confirmed his view of snipers as \u201ccowards\u201d who \u201cdon\u2019t believe in a fair fight\u201d but said he had not mentioned American Sniper in his tweet. \u201cSo here\u2019s what I think about American Sniper. Awesome performance from Bradley Cooper. One of the best of the year,\u201d wrote Moore. \u201cGreat editing. Costumes, hair, makeup superb!\u201d The film-maker nevertheless suggested he had mixed views of the movie, which stars Bradley Cooper as real-life US Navy Seal and sniper Chris Kyle, known for 160 confirmed kills in Iraq. \u201cToo bad Clint gets Vietnam and Iraq confused in his storytelling,\u201d wrote Moore. \u201cAnd that he has his characters calling Iraqis \u2018savages\u2019 throughout the film. \u201cBut there is also anti-war sentiment expressed in the movie. And there\u2019s a touching ending as the main character is remembered after being gunned down by a fellow American vet with PTSD who was given a gun at a gun range back home in Texas \u2013 and then used it to kill the man who called himself the \u2018America Sniper\u2019.\u201d He added: \u201cMost of us were taught the story of Jesse James and that the scoundrel wasn\u2019t James (who was a criminal who killed people) but rather the sniper who shot him in the back. I think most Americans don\u2019t think snipers are heroes. Hopefully not on this weekend when we remember that man in Memphis, Tennessee, who was killed by a sniper\u2019s bullet.\u201d Kyle, who was shot dead in February 2013, has been criticised as a soldier who reportedly described killing as \u201cfun\u201d, referred to his victims as \u201cdamn savages\u201d and bragged about murdering looters during Hurricane Katrina, the latter claim remaining unsubstantiated. However, Eastwood\u2019s film has resonated with the American public, netting the highest opening weekend for a drama ever. The US comic and actor Seth Rogen said on Twitter that American Sniper reminded him of the Nazi propaganda movie seen in the final part of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s second world war romp Inglourious Basterds, but later also denied explicit criticism of Eastwood\u2019s film. \u201cI just said something \u2018kinda reminded\u2019 me of something else,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI actually liked American Sniper. It just reminded me of the Tarantino scene... But if you were having a slow news day, you\u2019re welcome for me giving you the opportunity to blow something completely out of proportion.\u201d Sarah Palin has meanwhile added her two cents, writing on Facebook: \u201cHollywood leftists: while caressing shiny plastic trophies you exchange among one another while spitting on the graves of freedom fighters who allow you to do what you do, just realize the rest of America knows you\u2019re not fit to shine Chris Kyle\u2019s combat boots... May the epic American Sniper bring nothing but blessings to Taya and the children of this true American hero.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
