Scholes, the fourth United player to face a Football Association disciplinary charge this season, admitted violent behaviour but his guilty plea did not earn him any leniency during a hearing in Manchester yesterday. Television pictures clearly showed him striking Doriva in an off-the-ball incident during the first half of Middlesbrough's 3-2 win, an offence which would almost certainly have been punished with a red card had the referee, Paul Durkin, not missed it because he was following the play. The three-match suspension is standard punishment for an act of violence and yesterday's outcome was largely expected at Old Trafford. As well as the Charlton match, Scholes will be unavailable for Liverpool's visit to Old Trafford on Saturday and the trip to Blackburn a week later, but by immediately turning down the opportunity to appeal the England international midfielder has at least ensured he will not miss the visit of Chelsea on May 8 and the FA Cup final against Millwall on May 22. \"We have had a good hearing. Paul explained his position and the panel accepted how the matter came about,\" said Maurice Watkins, the club's solicitor. There was better news for United yesterday when Ferguson revealed that Ruud van Nistelrooy would \"definitely play\" against Charlton, having not figured at all this month because of an injured knee. Roy Keane and Phil Neville are also back in contention and Kleberson should be available for the Liverpool match after recovering from damaged knee ligaments. Only a month after being promised a new dawn, Leeds United fans have voiced growing concern over the new regime amid speculation that the former Bradford City chairman Geoffrey Richmond is to be made chief executive. The group of local businessmen, led by new chairman Gerald Krasner, which took over the club in a \u00a325m deal, face a backlash from fans. Supporters' groups are concerned at the growing influence of Richmond, who led Bradford to the Premiership then to the brink of liquidation, and his son David, the new commercial director. Leeds last week handed responsibility for all transfer negotiations to Richmond Sr and it is understood that he will be appointed chief executive in the summer unless new investors come on board. \"Anyone stupid enough to think Richmond is the answer clearly doesn't know what the question is,\" the Leeds United Supporters Trust chairman John Boocock said yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
