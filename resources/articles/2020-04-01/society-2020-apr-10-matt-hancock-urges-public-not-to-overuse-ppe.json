The government does not recommend the general use of protective face masks to slow the spread of disease, and Hancock warned the public against overusing protective equipment. He reiterated that hand washing, social distancing and staying at home are the best ways to avoid infection. \u201cA front door is better than any face mask\u201d, he said. Hancock and the chief nursing officer, Ruth May, declined to give a figure for how many healthcare staff have died after contracting the virus. The health secretary said a nationwide delivery system had been set up, with the help of the armed forces, to distribute masks, aprons and other equipment to 58,000 healthcare providers. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had to create a whole new logistics network, essentially from scratch.\u201d Within a week, every NHS hospital would be receiving daily deliveries, he added. The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, welcomed the promise that more PPE would reach the frontline but pressed Hancock to ensure his target was met. Ashworth said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time ministers have given NHS and social care staff big promises on PPE. But there has been a mismatch between statements at Downing Street press conferences and the realities facing health and care staff on the ground. \u201cStaff have been raising the lack of PPE for weeks. We hope the government\u2019s plans today deliver the adequate supplies of PPE our brave healthcare staff deserve.\u201d Doctors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 leaders criticised Hancock\u2019s plan as inadequate, given the growing death toll of NHS staff from coronavirus. The British Medical Association said PPE shortages could spell \u201creal disaster\u201d for doctors. It also took issue with Hancock\u2019s insistence that the NHS has enough PPE to go round but needs frontline staff to use \u201cno more and no less\u201d than they clinically require. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA\u2019s chair, said: \u201cWe are dealing with an unknown, highly infectious, and potentially deadly virus that has already claimed the lives of several healthcare workers, including 11 doctors in the UK. \u201cIt is absurd that the people trained to treat this disease are the ones who are not being appropriately protected \u2013 and without them, we face real disaster. \u201cWe note the government\u2019s announcement this afternoon \u2026 However, PPE should not be a \u2018precious resource\u2019 and for NHS staff facing shortages of protection they need today, they don\u2019t want to hear of a plan, but that this vital equipment is made available to the frontline now.\u201d Susan Masters, director of nursing at the Royal College of Nursing, also voiced scepticism that Hancock\u2019s pledges would end the supply problems that are causing alarm among staff, and denied nurses were misusing PPE. Masters said: \u201cThese figures on deliveries are only impressive when nursing staff stop contacting me to say what they need to use wasn\u2019t available. The calls are still coming through \u2013 people are petrified. They have seen colleagues die already. \u201cThings have improved in recent days and I credit the government with that. But the safety of nurses and care staff must not be compromised. They are pretty clear about what they need to do to stay safe and they will be angered by any suggestion they cause shortages by misusing kit.\u201d As well as promising to tackle what he acknowledged was the \u201cenormous challenge\u201d of ensuring PPE reaches those who need it, Hancock said lab capacity had been increased sufficiently to allow any health or social care worker who needs it, to be tested. He visited a newly opened \u201cmega-lab\u201d in Milton Keynes on Thursday and said 15 drive-through testing centres were available. He stressed the complexities of meeting demand for PPE against the background of rocketing global demand, and without a significant domestic supply sector. Diplomatic staff around the world have been pressed into service trying to source equipment, Hancock said, with Whitehall officials in London trying to organise transporting it to the UK. He praised firms, including Burberry and Rolls-Royce, which have turned their facilities to manufacturing PPE \u2013 and urged others to do so, based on requirements published by the government. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got production facilities, and you can meet our published specifications, we want to hear from you,\u201d he said. Appearing alongside Hancock, May underlined the toll, both physical and mental, that treating the virus is having on her frontline colleagues. But she said they were heartened by the public\u2019s support. \u201cThe rainbows and NHS signs in the windows lift me, and they lift my colleagues,\u201d she said. She and Hancock emphasised the importance of the public continuing to use the NHS for conditions unrelated to the coronavirus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
