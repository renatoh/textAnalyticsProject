My giddy awakening came on a package holiday to Benidorm with a schoolfriend and her single mother. It started on the flight from Manchester to Alicante, full of women with tattoos and single fortysomethings called Steve. My friend's wayward mother plied us with vodka and orange throughout the flight; having never drunk alcohol before, as soon as we arrived at our hovel of an apartment I threw up over the balcony. There was only one bedroom, with three single beds in a line. Late at night, the addled mother would fling open the door, shout 'Geronimo!', then divebomb our beds. That's if she came home at all. Determined to make the most of our freedom, my friend and I headed out on the pull. Despite our spotty, pasty pallor, we managed to grab two lads from Barnsley who must have been hammered enough not to notice. Needless to say we were dumped for two lasses from Scunthorpe a couple of days later. After them we only managed to snog the obligatory Spanish waiters, both called Jose. For the rest of our time we wandered feral and survived on chips. By the end of the holiday I had so embraced the hedonistic lifestyle that I couldn't relate to school on my return. Others adopt dreadlocks and tattoos after their life-changing trip; I just caked on the fake tan and discovered a liking for vodka and greasy men that was never to leave me fully."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
