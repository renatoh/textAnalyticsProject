Speaking at a rally in central London on Monday night, Burnham said Labour had previously been too timid and repeated pledges to bring the railways into public ownership, scrap the charitable status for private schools and replace tuition fees with a graduate tax. \u201cLet\u2019s have a Labour alternative and a balanced plan for the economy that doesn\u2019t reduce the deficit just by punishing the poorest and most vulnerable,\u201d said Burnham. \u201cA balanced plan where Labour isn\u2019t frightened of using a word we haven\u2019t said in recent times. Tax! Why don\u2019t we bring down the deficit by asking people who can to pay more tax.\u201d Burnham promised a church hall filled with supporters that a Labour party led by him would not propose policies that were \u201chopeless dreams or pie in the sky\u201d, but that they would \u201cthink big again\u201d. \u201cLabour has spent too long bowing down before the mantra that the market has the answer to everything,\u201d he said. Labour was highly critical of the chancellor, George Osborne, for reducing the 50p top rate of tax to 45p in 2013 and pledged to bring it back for people earning more than \u00a3150,000 a year in the party\u2019s election manifesto. Labour\u2019s interim leadership dropped its opposition to the policy after July\u2019s budget, but Burnham and fellow leadership candidate Yvette Cooper have both said they would continue to oppose the policy if they led their party. A week after ballot papers for the Labour leadership election started arriving on people\u2019s doorsteps, Burnham and Cooper are battling to persuade voters away from frontrunner Jeremy Corbyn. Burnham joked on Monday that the race had been going on a long time, but he could still remember a time when he was the favourite. The shadow health secretary was heckled by audience members demanding to know why he had voted with the party\u2019s leadership and abstained on the welfare bill. Burnham said he had not wanted to lead a rebellion and split the party, adding that it was stronger united. Introducing Burnham, former deputy prime minister John Prescott said Labour had allowed itself to be \u201cscrewed\u201d by Conservative propaganda on the economy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t put any argument up. We constantly argued to the [parliamentary Labour party] and I was told by the two Eds that we were concentrating on the future and not the past,\u201d said Prescott. \u201cWe got screwed on the past.\u201d He said of some of his former cabinet colleagues that they needed to \u201cshow a bit more humility when they make their comments about who they would work with or wouldn\u2019t work with\u201d. Cooper and Kendall have both said they would not serve in a Corbyn-led shadow cabinet. A string of senior party figures \u2013 including Tony Blair, Neil Kinnock, Jack Straw, Gordon Brown, David Blunkett and David Miliband \u2013 have issued warnings that a Corbyn win would risk turning the party into a mere pressure group. Labour will announce the result of its leadership election on 12 September. Under new rules anyone can vote if they pay \u00a33 to register as a supporter, which prompted concerns that the system was being played by people who support other parties. About 400,000 people have become eligible to vote in the contest since the general election, 120,000 of them paying to become registered supporters, swelling the electorate to 600,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
