Data recorded by EA Sports, which works officially with the Premier League, has indicated no one has run faster than the Everton and England centre-half this season with Jagielka reaching a speed of 35.99kmh (22mph) against Leicester City on the opening day of the campaign. There was only one winger, Swansea\u2019s Nathan Dyer, in the top 10 compiled by the analysts, though confirmation Jagielka\u2019s burst of pace leaves others trailing did not come as a surprise to his club-mate. \u201cWe have always known that,\u201dBaines said. \u201cFootball people will always know that. You see it all the time: when someone renowned for being quick is not getting away from someone. I have never seen anyone run away from him. \u201cI think that is why he has always been brilliant for Everton and never really got the credit he deserved. I don\u2019t think he is too bothered by that. He likes to come in, do his job and is not interested in plaudits. He\u2019s just a strong, powerful lad. \u201cWe have seen him play against some quick players. That is always why we have felt secure. Even one on one at the back, you feel we will be fine. He reads the game really well, but other players will have known.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
