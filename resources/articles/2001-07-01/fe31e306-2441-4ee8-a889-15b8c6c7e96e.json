Euphoric partying is all very well for the fans, but he and his charges will not be relaxing just yet. 'We have got to keep our feet on the ground,' the former schoolmaster warned. 'We didn't play well in the last 20 minutes and the Australians will be a lot better side next week. I think they were a wee bit underdone today.' Martin Johnson, hardly a hedonist himself, was more ebullient about the situation, clearly inspired by the support the Lions were enjoying. 'I went out on to the pitch to toss up an hour before kick-off,' he said, 'and when I went back into the dressing room I told the lads it was virtually going to be a home game out there. The support was unbelievable - I have never seen anything like it.' And the Lions skipper was also pretty chuffed with his players, hailing the performance as one of the best he has been involved in, despite the grumbles that had been emanating from the camp beforehand. Henry and Johnson's Australian counterparts were understandably less enthusiastic about the evening's events, but both coach Rod Macqueen and captain John Eales paid handsome tribute to the tourists. 'The Lions were quite outstanding,' said Eales, 'and we weren't up to the challenge. They're the best-prepared team to have come to Australia.' Macqueen also pointed to the new challenge that the Lions posed for his Wallabies. 'They were able to make some holes in our defence which is a problem we haven't had for a few years. But we weren't happy with the way we played. We can play much better than that.' So it seems the Aussies are also keen to keep the Lions honest. The fans can enjoy themselves for a week, but the players still have work to do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
