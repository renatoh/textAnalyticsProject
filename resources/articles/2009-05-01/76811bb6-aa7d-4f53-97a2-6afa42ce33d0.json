The stage features 18 jazz musicians playing everything from trombones to a vibraphone. Fronting them is David Gedge donning a velvet jacket and tapping a toe swing-style. He describes this Fuse festival collaboration, which features the back catalogue of his groups Wedding Present and Cinerama after a jazz makeover, as \"the weirdest thing I've ever done\". He's not wrong. As Gedge's northern accent mixes with walls of trumpets, he is really singing for the first time in his career. Gedge is no Sinatra, but does unveil what could be described as a Tetley's Bitter croon - smooth, but with curious rough edges. The No 10 single from 1992, Come Play With Me - \"my greatest hit ever\" - is delivered as an up-tempo swing. My Favourite Dress has never sounded like this before, beginning, \"Sometimes I ... ah, shit!\" as the nervous indie man takes three attempts to get it right. Hearing his vocals more audibly than usual, it's sobering how many of Gedge's songs are about girls who left him for someone else - or perhaps one girl, who left over and over. She wears that Favourite Dress for someone else. In Heather, she frolics on the moors where she formerly played with Gedge. You want to shout, \"Dave, get over it, man. Or at least stop following her around.\" They're fine songs, but they don't always work with similar-sounding brass arrangements. The startling exception is Cinerama's Don't Touch That Dial with just Gedge's haunting vocal and piano. It is something he must build on - the magical moment that makes this brave but failed experiment worthwhile."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
