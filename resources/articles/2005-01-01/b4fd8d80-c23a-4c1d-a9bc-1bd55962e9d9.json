'Collect stamps. Or butterflies. If you can't catch 'em up here, hang yer rod up and do something else.' We were in Darwin, state capital of Australia's Northern Territory, picking the brains of the locals for their fishing knowledge. More specifically we were seeking advice about barramundi, a fighting fish respected and revered in Australia's Top End for its tenacity and cunning. 'Lazy buggers when it's cold, just lie on the bottom. Gotta get among 'em. Stir 'em up a bit,' another old hand mused absent-mindedly, as though remembering past tussles. It was the barra, to give it its familiar name - some more than a metre long, held aloft by proud anglers - that was the subject of the photographs which lined the walls. And the mission of my friend and I was to catch one in what is regarded as the finest barra fishing country in the world. It was strange embarking on such a mission. For years fishing had conjured up a depressingly bleak picture of waterproofed figures hunched miserably under over-sized umbrellas with nothing but flasks of luke-warm coffee for company. Why people would willingly put themselves through such unnecessary torment in their leisure time was one of life's mysteries. Yet here we were with rods, reels, live bait, dead bait, plastic bait, buckets, hooks, sinkers, weights and countless other fishing accessories ready to begin our quest. And we were not alone. Barra fishing is a popular pastime for locals and tourists in the Northern Territory and in the north of Western Australia. Several companies offer fishing day trips along the various rivers that snake through the region. But at A$220 (about \u00a389) a throw, we opted for the do-it-yourself approach. Our first attempt came at Buffalo Creek, on the outskirts of Darwin. Bordered by the huge expanse of Lee Point beach and vast mangrove swamps, the creek was bewitching. We cast our lines and waited. And waited. For a long while. Until, after three lengthy sessions, we gave up. But we weren't too worried. After all, it was only a warm-up and besides, the water was still a little cold for barra. The World Heritage-listed Kakadu National Park, one of Australia's iconic natural environments and a mecca for anglers, would be different. With a staggering array of bird and animal life, Kakadu, 250km south east of Darwin, can truly be described as a wilderness. For three days and nights we camped and fished at Four-Mile Hole, a remote spot on the Wildman River, where early morning bought a thick band of mist drifting across the plain behind us, half shrouding dingos trotting across the horizon. Meanwhile, egrets, whistling kites and jabirus began their daily chores amid a cacophony of noise. Also sharing our stretch of river were huge saltwater crocodiles that lurked menacingly beneath the water or basked contentedly, open-jawed, on the opposite bank. Caution, we were warned, is the key word when fishing in such locations. Salties, apparently, do not take too kindly to man invading their territory and diminishing their supply of food. We were told to fish a few paces back from the water's edge and not to scale and gut our catch into the water - assuming, of course, we managed to persuade anything onto our hooks. The setting was wonderful. If we drew a blank here, we consoled ourselves, there could be no better place to fail. Three days later we consoled ourselves that there could have been no better place to have failed. Twice we came agonisingly close to landing 40cm barra - not quite large enough to keep (55cm is the minimum legal size) - but after playing dead, they performed passable impersonations of salmon by leaping several feet, spitting out the hook and escaping. Kakadu may have been our best hope, but certainly not our last. Heading west along the Victoria Highway would take us to the small town of Kununurra, otherwise known as Barra Country. Now call me an optimistic fool, but that sounded encouraging. We pitched our tents at Mambi Island, a rustic campsite on the banks of the River Ord, 40 miles down a dirt track north of town. Spirits soared. Barra were in the area - being caught and barbecued. Our time had come. The Ord, broad and lazy and bordered by tall, delicate trees, meandered through pristine surroundings. Egrets glided inches from the surface, their reflection perfectly mirrored in the mid-afternoon stillness of the water. It was a stunning fishing environment. But still the barra refused to bite. Further advice came from a six-strong fishing group from Darwin who, without fail, returned from their daily fishing expeditions loaded with 'eaters', the technical term for a fish that doesn't get a second chance. Also without fail was their extraordinary inability to agree on anything. Heated rows ensued as they debated, in robust language, the best time to fish and most suitable bait. Depending on whom you collared, the best time of day was low tide, high tide, 6am, 8pm, when the moon is full and when there's no moon at all. We tried them all. Frustratingly, we could even see the barra - their red eyes illuminated at night - but somehow they seemed to know. And then disaster. My fishing companion, who had shared countless fruitless expeditions with me, landed one. An eater, to boot. Sure, it was a suicidal fish, virtually hurling itself onto the bank. But he had broken his duck. That night we sprinkled it with herbs, added a dash of lemon and cooked it over the camp fire. He was jubilant, unnecessarily extolling the virtues of stamp collecting. Desperation set in. I had to level the score. For three successive days, I stirred at 4.30am, impelled by some foolhardy notion of catching the barra unaware. This was no longer a quest. It was an obsession. I tried new bait - prawns, donated by the now sympathetic gang of six who had grown accustomed to my empty-handed treks back to camp. Out of respect, they stopped asking if I'd caught anything. Not that I didn't come close. More than once I had one, only for it to perform its Houdini routine. And countless times hopes were raised and crushed in equal measure on realisation that my suddenly taught line had not a barra on the end but a submerged tree root. It wasn't to be. On my return to Kununurra for the flight back to Darwin and London, I had one final cast at Ivanhoe Crossing, another beautiful stretch of the Ord. I envisaged a glorious finale, a last-gasp triumph, my fishing peers watching in awe as I reeled in a monster barra. I could see the photo in the bar. I cast - and watched the bait, hook, line and sinker, fly off into the distance. Knot tying was never my strong point - but you should see my stamp collection.
