Much of it is based on common sense, and may therefore seem unfamiliar to you. General Advice. The best subjects for Silly Season stories are the most obvious: Big Brother antics, surprisingly good weather, surprisingly bad weather, funny animal stories, root vegetables shaped like celebrities, odd items being auctioned on eBay and humorous fatalities from the United States. Don't stray too far from the formula. What To Do In An Emergency. Make a preparedness kit containing the following items: \u00b7 a large picture of Catherine Zeta-Jones \u00b7 Prince Charles's summer schedule \u00b7 phone numbers of freelance journalists who don't mind dressing up \u00b7 full-page layout celebrating the 90th anniversary of the bra \u00b7 latest Photoshop software package Scare Stories. August is not intrinsically scarier than any other month, but it's still a good time to speculate about how many people might die if floodwaters wiped out London, or if terrorists stole the National Grid. Apply words like plague, epidemic, panic and horror to stories about flying ants, athlete's foot, Harry Potter DVD shortages and EU bureaucracy. Be Alert. Always think to yourself, \"How can I make this story sillier?\" Try a unique angle: find the first person to die of rising interest rates. Think how a possible hosepipe ban could affect Catherine Zeta-Jones. What might Keira Knightley's National ID Card look like? Be Proactive. Don't wait for silly things to happen. Ring up people who have been known to streak at sporting events. Goad animal rights activists into rescuing bees. Press Jodie Marsh for her views on household debt. Also, keep a sharp lookout for TV actors behaving in a fashion consistent with the characters they play, ie someone off Casualty going to casualty. What To Do If You Are On Holiday. Are you relaxing ona beach near anyone famous, or topless, or both? It is your duty to report any sightings immediately. Perhaps you've seen someone who looks like a celebrity, but isn't. That might work if you can get a pic and a short interview. If not, can you do 600 words about what a nightmare it is hiring a car in Spain? Find an internet cafe, and don't forget about the time difference."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
