It\u2019s saved, in the main, for weddings and other celebrations \u2013 and not only because the longer you cook it, the better it gets. It\u2019s also unapologetically rich; makhani means \u201cbuttery\u201d in Hindi. Niki Segnit sums the spirit of the dish up perfectly in Lateral Cooking, when she describes it as \u201cthe dal equivalent of Jo\u00ebl Robuchon\u2019s famously opulent puree de pomme de terre, except you don\u2019t even have to pretend to want anything else to go with it\u201d. Meera Sodha reckons it\u2019s \u201cone of the world\u2019s finest dishes\u201d, and all you need is a little patience, and a lot of ghee. The dal Dal makhani requires urad, sometimes written as urid, dal and \u2013 I made this mistake so you don\u2019t have to \u2013 not everything labelled as such is suitable. These small black beans are available whole, split (as used by chef Vivek Singh in his recipe in Spice At Home), and split and hulled \u2013 at which point they become known as white lentils, which are never used for black dal. Perhaps that seems obvious to you, especially if you\u2019re lucky enough to have grown up on the stuff, but staring at endless bags of beans in Drummond Street behind London\u2019s Euston station, it wasn\u2019t to me, so I offer up my own stupidity as a cautionary tale. Go for the things that look like tiny grey pebbles in the bag. Krishna Dutta\u2019s gloriously comprehensive Dal Cookbook includes a recipe for a Kashmiri-style dal makhani, contributed by an 80-year-old she describes as a \u201cpious Hindu\u201d, which uses five different types of dal \u2013 urad, channa, masoor, waxy toor and moong \u2013 as an \u201causpicious combination\u201d. The texture is far more varied than those using a single type, but delicious as it is, with urad dal as just one sixth of the total. It\u2019s not terribly black or, indeed, creamy, which, auspicious or not, seems a shame. Both Gowardhan and Romy Gill, whose gloriously rich dal makhani made a big impression on me when I visited her Thornbury restaurant last year, use a mixture of urad dal and kidney beans, Gowardhan explaining that \u201curad dal is a lentil that thrives on slow cooking; the longer it cooks, the richer the dal makhani is\u201d. One Delhi restaurant famously simmers it for days on end, but without the luxury of time, \u201cthe addition of a small quantity or rajma or kidney beans will give the makhani gravy its rich texture, and also a little bit of colour\u201d. They do indeed lend the finished dish a better colour, but neither my testers nor I think they add much else, so I\u2019m going to leave them out. However, if you do happen to have some dried kidney beans lying around in need of using up (dried beans and pulses are best used within six months of purchase, according to Dutta; the older they are the longer they will take to soften), by all means use them in place of some of the urad dal. I do like Gowardhan\u2019s suggestion of roughly mashing the cooked dal; in the absence of 40-odd hours to tend the dish, this is a useful shortcut for thickening the gravy. The spices While Dutta, Gill, Sodha and Gowardhan cook their pulses separately, Singh and Will Bowlby, head chef at London\u2019s Kricket, simmer them with onions, chillies and spices. I find this makes them difficult to skim, and gives the onion a rather slimy consistency, but the subtle, smoky sweetness that Anjali Pathak\u2019s black cardamom and cinnamon gives the beans in her book Secrets from My Indian Family Kitchen, does appeal. If you don\u2019t happen to have them, though, don\u2019t worry \u2013 they\u2019re by no means essential. This isn\u2019t a dish that demands hundreds of different spices \u2013 indeed, Sodha uses just chilli powder \u2013 but warming garam masala, as used by Gill, Gowardhan and Dutta, works well with the richness of the cream, along with cumin for earthiness and coriander for zestiness \u2013 both popular ingredients in the recipes I try. The secret ingredient in Gill\u2019s dal, which proves the runaway winner among my testers, is methi, or fenugreek leaves, which she tells me is a typical Punjabi ingredient. They add a haunting, smoky, almost musty flavour that takes me right back to India. Do try to find them, if you can; Asian supermarkets will carry them, and they\u2019re commonly stocked in the speciality ingredients or world food aisles of large supermarkets. The aromatics Dutta\u2019s recipe is unique in containing no onion or garlic, which are off limits to devout Hindus (hence the asafoetida, which is often used to impart a compensatory, savoury note in their place). Everyone else adds large amounts of the latter, along with ginger, and Gowardhan, Singh, Sodha, Bowlby and Pathak also start their dals with golden, slow-cooked onions, which gives them an answering sweetness to the beans and spices. I would suggest chopping, rather than slicing them, however; the tangle of the former spoils the smoothness of the gravy for me. Fresh chillies are also common: finely chop them if you enjoy heat; slit them and remove from the dal before serving if you\u2019d prefer a milder result. Tomatoes: yes or no? Only Dutta leaves these out altogether; the rest of the recipes are divided fairly evenly between fresh fruit and puree \u2013 we all prefer the latter, and not just because decent fresh tomatoes are so hard to come by in the UK for most of the year. The rich, deep, cooked flavour of the puree just works better with the earthy lentils and cream. The dairy \u201cThe reason I say this dish is for special occasions,\u201d Gowardhan writes, \u201cis the copious quantities of butter and cream. No recipe should skimp on it, and nor will mine!\u201d Wise words: for my greedy crowd, Dutta\u2019s yoghurt just won\u2019t cut it. Sodha, interestingly, uses whole milk, simmering it down to sticky sweetness, and copious amounts of butter, but perhaps unsurprisingly, the double whammy of double cream and butter or ghee favoured by Bowlby, Singh and Gill proves the most popular. You can reduce the latter, if you like, but it seems a shame \u2013 there are thousands of great recipes for everyday dals out there (indeed, Dutta\u2019s book is stuffed full of them), but this isn\u2019t one of them. Perfect dal makhani Prep 15 min, plus soaking time Cook 50 min Serves 4-6 as a main or side 200g urad dal, whole and unhulled 1 cinnamon stick (optional) 2 black cardamom pods (optional) 5 tbsp ghee or butter 2 large onions, peeled and finely chopped 20g piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated 5 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed 2 green chillies, slit (or finely chopped, if you\u2019d like your dal hotter) 1 tsp garam masala 1 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp ground coriander \u00bd tsp Kashmiri red chilli powder 75g tomato puree 150ml double cream 2 tbsp dried fenugreek leaves Fresh coriander (optional) Soak the dal overnight, then rinse well and drain. Cover with three times as much cold water and bring to a boil. Skim, then add the cinnamon stick and cardamom pods, if using. Simmer until the beans are soft enough to crush easily against the side of the pan, topping up the water if necessary, because they should always be covered (this will probably take 45 minutes to an hour). Meanwhile, melt four tablespoons of ghee in a large frying pan over a medium heat, then gently sweat the onions until soft and golden. Stir in the ginger, garlic and green chillies, cook for another minute or so, then stir in all the dried spices apart from the fenugreek leaves, and cook, stirring, for a few minutes more. Turn down the heat and stir in first the tomato puree and then, gradually, the cream and fenugreek. Turn off the heat. When the dal is ready, drain it over a bowl, retaining the water, then roughly mash so some of the dal is squashed and some remains whole. Stir all the dal into the pan with the sauce, then, over a low heat, add just enough of the cooking water to bring it to your desired consistency \u2013 I like mine quite thick, rather than soupy. Season to taste and serve with a scattering of fresh coriander, if you like the stuff. \u2022 Dal makhani: a heart attack in healthfood\u2019s clothing, or the most delicious thing you can do with lentils?
