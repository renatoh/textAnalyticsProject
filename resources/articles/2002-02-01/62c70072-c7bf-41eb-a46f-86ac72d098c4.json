Williams, 28, is hoping for a world title shot within 12 months and was a class removed from Sprott, a game late substitute. The champion probably could and should have won sooner than he did. In the fourth round Williams had the challenger on the canvas after a classic attack. First he thudded a right hook and a left hook into Sprott's ribcage and, as the Reading man's gloves dropped, he delivered two chopping right hands to put his man down. Another big attack had Sprott in trouble, but he was rescued by the bell and survived in excess of two more rounds. Perhaps thinking Sprott's bravery might become an embarrassing negative on his record, Williams launched a furious attack when the seventh round began. Sprott bravely stayed on his feet but was absorbing unanswered blows from all angles when his experienced trainer Jimmy Tibbs had seen enough. He held up a white towel, although Sprott was still on his feet, prompting an intervention by the referee Richie Davies. Whether Williams has the ability to test the best in the division is unclear. At times he appeared to lose the plot, allowing his work rate to drop, but there were moments when he produced moves of genuine class and he may be able to secure the title shot he hopes for. He has signed a promotional deal with Don King and hopes to challenge the World Boxing Association champion John Ruiz within the year. \"I felt rusty tonight,\" he said, \"and was a little disappointed with my performance. I think I need to have at least one more fight before I step up to fight people like John Ruiz or Hasim Rahman.\" In a thrilling principal support bout the Welshman Bradley Pryce came from behind to stop Gavin Down in the ninth round of their International Boxing Federation Intercontinental light-welterweight title fight. Both men earned their standing ovation from the appreciative crowd. \u00b7 Mike Tyson has been given 30 days to obtain a licence and find a suitable venue or his world heavyweight title challenge to Lennox Lewis will be off, according to Gary Shaw of Main Events, Lewis's American promoters. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
