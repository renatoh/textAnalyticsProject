Results so far show his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, with an edge in the race to 270 electoral college votes after flipping the state of Arizona, but it could be days before the outcome is known. \u201cThe president\u2019s statement tonight about trying to shut down the counting of duly cast ballots was outrageous, unprecedented and incorrect,\u201d said the Biden campaign manager, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, in a statement. The Democrats went further on Wednesday mid-morning when Dillon said in a live address, \u201cWe believe we are on a clear path to victory by this afternoon\u201d and that Biden was on course to become the president of the United States. That Trump had been widely predicted to make a baseless assertion of triumph and resort to the courts to stop votes being counted did not make his 2.21am speech at the White House any less shocking. Some likened the move, unprecedented in American history, to a presidential coup. \u201cOnce again, the president is lying to the American people and acting like a would-be despot,\u201d tweeted Adam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee. \u201cWe will count every vote. And ignore the noise.\u201d Trump spoke in the East Room with numerous US flags behind him and flanked by two TV screens, which had been showing Fox News. Around 150 guests were standing with few face masks and little physical distancing. Donald Trump Jr, Ivanka Trump and other family members sat in the front row. \u201cMillions and millions of people voted for us tonight, and a very sad group of people is trying to disenfranchise that group of people and we won\u2019t stand for it,\u201d Trump said to whoops and cheers. \u201cWe will not stand for it.\u201d There is no evidence for Trump\u2019s allegation of disenfranchisement. The president listed some correct state victories, some false claims of state victories, and dived deep into unfounded conspiracy theories. \u201cAnd did I predict this, did I say this? I\u2019ve been saying this from the day I heard they were going to send out tens of millions of ballots because either they were going to win or, if they didn\u2019t win, they\u2019ll take us to court.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election. So our goal now is to ensure the integrity \u2013 for the good of this nation, this is a very big moment \u2013 this is a major fraud on our nation. \u201cWe want the law to be used in a proper manner, so we\u2019ll be going to the US supreme court. We want all voting to stop. We don\u2019t want them to find any ballots at four o\u2019clock in the morning and add them to the list. OK? It\u2019s a very sad moment. \u201cWe will win this and as far as I\u2019m concerned we already have won it.\u201d Trump\u2019s demand for all voting to stop did not make sense after polls had already closed, but appeared to be an attempt to sow confusion about mail-in ballots. Millions are still to be counted in key battleground states in the midwest such as Pennsylvania and they are expected to heavily favour Biden. Trump has spent months arguing that mail-in ballots are prone to fraud. Experts say there is no evidence for this. The president appears to be pinning hopes that a conservative majority on the supreme court, including his recent appointment Amy Coney Barrett, will rule in his favour. The role of the attorney general, William Barr, who has been loyal to Trump, could also be critical. The scenario could also involve support from Republican senators, conservative media and the millions of people who voted for Trump\u2019s re-election, creating a powder keg with high potential for battles in the courts and the streets. Trump\u2019s attempt to enflame divisions to his political advantage provoked a fierce backlash. Dillon, Biden\u2019s campaign manager, said: \u201cThe counting will not stop. It will continue until every duly cast vote is counted. Because that is what our laws \u2013 the laws that protect every American\u2019s constitutional right to vote \u2013 require.\u201d Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic congresswoman from New York, tweeted: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s premature claims of victory are illegitimate, dangerous and authoritarian. Count the votes. Respect the results.\u201d The Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar added: \u201cThe irony of worrying about people turning America into Somalia, while allowing Trump to do literally what Somali dictators used to do. \u201cWe send election observers into other countries, we shouldn\u2019t need ours monitored.\u201d David Plouffe, a former campaign manager and White House senior adviser for Barack Obama, predicted \u201cdark and scary days\u201d to come. He told MSNBC: \u201cIt\u2019s one of the darkest hours the White House has ever seen, one of the darkest hours in American history \u2026 Even if Trump\u2019s not successful, and I don\u2019t think he will be if the votes are there for Joe Biden, you\u2019re going to have to 40 to 45% of the country believing him, which is going to affect our democracy going forward.\u201d Historian Michael Beschloss posted: \u201cTrump claiming a victory he never won, and saying he will take it to the supreme court. This is what dictators do. Stop.\u201d Even conservatives expressed criticism. Justin Amash, a former Republicam congressman from Michigan, tweeted: \u201cThat was one of the most dishonest and despotic speeches ever given by a president of the United States.\u201d Ben Shapiro, an author and media personality, wrote: \u201cNo, Trump has not already won the election, and it is deeply irresponsible for him to say he has.\u201d Earlier on Wednesday, Biden told supporters: \u201cIt\u2019s not my place or Donald Trump\u2019s place to declare who\u2019s won this election. That\u2019s the decision of the American people, but I\u2019m optimist about this outcome.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
