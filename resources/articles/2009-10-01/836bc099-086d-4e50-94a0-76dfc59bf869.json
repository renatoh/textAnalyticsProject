You do this using simple physics and a limited supply of bombs, ropes, balloons and pivot points, which are individually introduced over the course of six lovingly created worlds. With an interface that's perfectly designed for finger jabbing and rarely gets in the way when you're making pixel-wide adjustments to the positioning of a bomb or fractional timing adjustments, it's a simple joy to use. Glitches (its undo button works only intermittently, for example) are minuscule compared with the highly polished mechanics of the game and its masterful puzzles and soothing background music. iBlast Moki rocks.
