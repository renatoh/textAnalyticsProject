The current crisis cannot be overcome without a substantial increase in the role and scope of public power. The crisis stems, above all, from lax and incompetent public regulation of private economic power. That in turn stems from a profoundly dangerous economic philosophy, which holds that government failure is more prevalent and more damaging than market failure, that markets are always wiser and more rational than governments, and that if private market actors are allowed to pursue their private interests without interference from public authorities, the invisible hand of the market will necessarily deliver the best possible outcome for society as a whole. After the fall of communism, that philosophy became part of the conventional wisdom in the United States, in Britain, in the institutions of global economic governance like the IMF and the World Bank and to a lesser extent in most member states of the European Union. We have now been reminded that it was fatally flawed: that as John Maynard Keynes pointed out more than 70 years ago, financial markets, left to themselves, are governed less by reason than by a quintessentially irrational herd instinct and therefore have an inherent propensity to generate bubbles which are bound to burst sooner or later. When they burst, they are likely, in the absence of countervailing public action, to drag the whole economy down with them. So public power has to be deployed; and, as Keynes also showed, it has to be deployed in good times as well as in bad. The notion of the \"managed economy\" has fallen so far out of favour in the last twenty years that it has become little more than a memory. It must now return to the centre of the public policy stage: not just during the current crisis, but after it as well. But who is to do the managing? What form should public power take? In Keynes' day, the answers were not in doubt. The state would manage the economy, for it was in the state that public power took visible shape. In Europe, at least, I believe that the answer is grossly over-simplified, and may turn out to be almost as dangerous as the market fundamentalism that has got us into the current mess. The small and medium-sized states of Europe are too small and vulnerable \u2013 and also too divergent \u2013 to do the job. As I write, the British government has just launched a massive fiscal stimulus to avert the danger that the current downturn will turn into a real depression on the scale of the depression of the 1930s. It was right to do so. But there are formidable risks: chief among them the risk of a confidence crisis, and a precipitate fall in the value of the pound that would make it impossible for the government to borrow enough to finance the stimulus it seeks. The obvious answer is for Britain to join the euro; and although this is highly unlikely in the medium term, I don't rule it out. But irrespective of what may or may not happen to Britain, the crisis has shone a harsh light on a fatal flaw in the eurozone. Monetary policy has been Europeanised, but fiscal policy has been left to national governments. That was always a risky thing to do, but as long as the boom proceeded on its merry way all seemed to go well. Now the flaw has become obvious. In short, the eurozone, as presently constituted, is not enough. We need a smaller role for public power on the national level, and a bigger role for it on the European level. In that perspective, the whole language of \"state\" and \"non-state\" obscures more than it illuminates. \u2022 If laissez-faire politics is dead, how big a role should the state have?
