It was excellent for all sorts of reasons and, for an ex-communist like me, very uncomfortable at times too. But this isn't a review. I just want to pass on a couple of the best bits of dialogue about newspapers. Stoppard, whose first job on leaving school was as a journalist for the Western Daily Press, is never better than when dealing with the abyss that exists between the concept of press freedom and its practice. (Remember Night and Day from 1978?) Here's the character called Nigel, a reporter for the Cambridge Evening News, addressing Max, a hardline communist Cambridge University professor: \"If you had your way, the Cambridge Evening News would be a very different sort of newspaper. As would all the media. Well, you're much cleverer than me. Obviously. So my question is: am I missing something?\" Max: \"Yes.\" Later in the play, when Nigel has moved to a national paper, he says: \"We're the fourth estate... Good men went to prison to establish the public's right to know\". Max: \"They did, and personally I'd be keeping quiet about that if I were filling half the paper with salacious drivel about celebrities I've never heard of.\" Nigel then defends an intrusive story (about the late Pink Floyd founder Syd Barrett) by saying, \"I suppose you're going to say it's not true\", prompting another character, Stephen, to observe: \"Nothing so simple. What it is, is an unrebuttable lie. To anyone who knows, it's an overheated nonsense, apparently written for people with arrested development, and mindlessly cruel, but totally safe, a sort of triumph, really. But the oddest thing about it is that the cruelty and the dishonesty areb completely unmotivated, it's just a... kind of style.\" There's a great deal more for journalists to ponder, particularly a scene in which Nigel seeks to explain the difference between \"a piece\" and \"a story\". Priceless. Go see it if you can. It isn't only rock 'n' roll. It's much, much more than that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
