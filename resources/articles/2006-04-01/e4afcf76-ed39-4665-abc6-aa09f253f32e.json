After spending a few months in Vienna, where he studied with Anton Webern, he reached Palestine, living and teaching in Jerusalem until 1938 when he emigrated to the US. The works he completed in Jerusalem were his first to use the 12-note method, which he had studied with Webern, though Wolpe's approach was distinctly different from that of the Second Viennese School. The most substantial of the pieces in this collection of his Jerusalem works is the orchestral Passacaglia, based upon a collection of 36 notes and conceived as a vast architectural span with almost symphonic aspirations. This disc also includes two sets of woodwind duets, Three Smaller Canons and the Hexachord Suite, which show Wolpe exploring the possibilities of this new musical language. And his Concerto for Nine Instruments, a homage to Webern's own concerto Op 24, looks back to his earlier style as much as forward to his later music."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
