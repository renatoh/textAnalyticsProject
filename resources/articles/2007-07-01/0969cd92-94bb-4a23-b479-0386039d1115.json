Davide Lippi, son of the former Juventus and Italy coach Marcello Lippi and agent for both players, said he was meeting Juventus to discuss the future of the pair, adding that both would be keen to move to England, especially to play for Sven-Goran Eriksson. The Swede has already recruited an Italian, the \u00a38.8m striker Rolando Bianchi, from Reggina after taking over at City this summer. Chiellini, who captained Italy in the European Under-21 Championship this summer, fell out with Ranieri after complaining publicly following a contract wrangle. \"With his words he has caused damage within the group,\" Ranieri said. The tall, powerful left-back, who can also play in the centre of defence, played 32 games for Juventus in Serie B last season, scoring three goals. Capped six times by Italy at senior level, Juventus have already turned down offers of \u00a36.7m for the 22-year-old. They want at least \u00a38m. Blasi, a highly combative 26-year-old midfielder with one of the worst records of bookings in Serie A, is ready to move in order to play on a regular basis after understanding he will not have many opportunities under Ranieri. Capped eight times by Italy, Blasi has just returned from a loan spell at Fiorentina where he played 31 games last season. Juventus, who paid \u00a312m for him in 2003, would be ready to let him go for \u00a35m. Everton's injury-jinxed James Vaughan was so downhearted after learning a dislocated shoulder could rule him out until November that he considered giving up football, according to his team-mate Victor Anichebe. The 19-year-old England Under-21 striker lost almost two years of his career with a serious knee problem before returning to fitness to claim an Everton place last season. But he was devastated last week when he suffered the shoulder injury in a friendly at Preston. Now, while Everton are at a training camp in Los Angeles, he is beginning his rehabilitation on Merseyside. His fellow striker Anichebe said: \"When it happened he just wanted to give up because he was thinking 'how can this happen to me again?' But it is not a career-threatening injury. It is the timing, because he was doing so well.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
