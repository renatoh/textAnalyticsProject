Happily I was fortunate enough not to suffer any trouble with my teeth while playing hooker for Wasps and England. Eventually I became dental surgeon to the Rugby Football Union. Some 20 years ago the England team were preparing to tour Australia and, along with a medical, an inspection by a dentist became mandatory for insurance purposes. Dudley Wood, who was secretary of the RFU at the time, knew me and gave me a call. I still examine the touring sides before they go abroad - plus the past five Lions squads - and attend all the major fixtures at Twickenham. Before the West Stand was built in 1995 the stadium doctor, physiotherapist, orthopaedic surgeon and myself sat down with the architect and discussed what we wanted in terms of space and equipment to create a modern new facility for us. Today we have a dental surgery on site. On match days I get to the ground about three hours before kick-off and ensure that we are ready with sterile packs and instruments, and local anaesthetic. During a game I sit a couple of rows behind the replacements and Clive Woodward. I have a pair of binoculars so that I can clearly see what is happening on the pitch and when there is an injury I join the doctor and orthopaedic surgeon. After looking at the problem, whoever is not needed goes back to their seat. Players can spend only 15 minutes off the field while they are receiving treatment for a blood injury. Any more than that and they aren't allowed to return. If I have to stitch a wound then a pad can be placed on it until after the final whistle. The worst sights I have come across are teeth which have been broken off because of getting a knee in the mouth. Once a match has finished it's fair to say that if anyone does require my professional attention they don't wait for me to approach them first. And I will provide out-of-hours emergency cover to the touring sides - they don't have a dentist travelling with them. Another part of my role is to see that the England guys are aware of the importance of good oral hygiene: nobody should miss a game through tooth decay. Dietary changes mean they tend to eat small, frequent meals to maintain energy levels, but this can result in missing out on brushing their teeth often enough. But the lads are sensible: they realise the benefits of staying dentally, as well as physically, fit. I also give advice to clubs and schools, including the necessity of wearing a customised mouthguard - one that has been made by a dentist from an accurate impression of the mouth so that it is comfortable and stays in place during contact. My view is that mouthguards should be regarded as an important part of the kit to play rugby. The kind I make for the national team should last at least a season. They come in white, though each has the English rose on it placed just left of the centre line. That's just something that I decided to do for the players as a patriotic little touch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
