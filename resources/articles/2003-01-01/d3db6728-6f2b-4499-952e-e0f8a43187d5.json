Buying a player on the day he picked up a six-match ban was unusual enough, but the club surely made history by becoming the first to sit bottom of the Premiership in January with four England midfielders on their books. Bowyer's West Ham debut will most likely come in a quartet featuring Michael Carrick, Joe Cole and Trevor Sinclair. The last two went to the World Cup, Carrick has played under Sven-Goran Eriksson and Bowyer would surely have more than a single cap but for his court case. What it will say about West Ham if they go down with such a rich combination, their fans would rather not consider just now. Some feel angry that Bowyer has been given a contract at Upton Park. Others, including the club's manager Glenn Roeder, are overjoyed to have obtained someone who would ordinarily have been beyond their reach. \"This is a football opportunity for us to sign a player who under different circumstances would have been out of our price range,\" Roeder has said. Bowyer's behaviour has been too despicable at times to make him a likeable character but he could prove a bargain at around \u00a3300,000. Relegation would cost West Ham millions. Whether a midfielder and a striker - Roeder's remaining target - are what the club need to survive only time will tell. Often this season they have lacked a commanding central defender and their last clean sheet was at the end of October. But Roeder has staked his reputation on his dealings in this transfer window, and Bowyer, in more ways than one, encapsulates that element of risk. Roeder, like everyone, waits to see which Bowyer will turn out for West Ham: the talented, hugely energetic midfielder capable of scoring goals and winning challenges, or the thug who stamped on the head of a Malaga player to earn the ban that was handed out yesterday. Bowyer has to show that the two can be separated. Recklessness is something West Ham can do without in their present predicament. Roeder has not spoken about where he intends to play Bowyer but there seems a good chance he will be used alongside Carrick in the centre of midfield, with Sinclair and Cole in the wide positions. The alternative is for him to play on the right, giving Cole and Carrick the central ground. If fear has sometimes hindered West Ham at home this season, that is the last emotion to be expected from Bowyer. \"He is a nice lad and not a madman,\" said Jermain Defoe, a new team-mate. \"He is just aggressive, someone in the middle that can win the ball - and is good going forward as well. Especially in the situation we are in, we need aggressive players in the team and I think Lee will do a good job. When you watch him play and see him going in for 50-50s you can see he is a winner - just what we want.\" Defoe and Bowyer were together at Charlton in the mid-90s, though they barely knew each other given an age gap of more than five years. Both are likewise products of the Senrab club in east London which has also seen Sol Campbell and Muzzy Izzet pass through its ranks. For Bowyer, brought up in Poplar, this move has brought him full circle. His desire to return to his roots in the capital has been well documented, though it says something that, seemingly, the only London club willing to pay even a paltry fee for the 26-year-old were West Ham. This is a player for whom Liverpool almost shelled out \u00a39m last summer until G\u00e9rard Houllier decided he lacked \"the hunger or desire to play for the club\". Few will forget the words of the Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale just over a year ago when asked whether, with hindsight, he would authorise the purchase of Bowyer if the player were put up for sale by another club. \"It is one question I was asked by our manager this week,\" he said, \"and, no, I would not.\" There are plenty who can recount that Bowyer has tested positive for marijuana, was nearly jailed for throwing chairs across a McDonald's restaurant, stood trial after an Asian student was brutally attacked in Leeds and initially refused to pay a club fine for breaking drinking regulations on the night of that incident. Fewer can recall that his ability made him the country's costliest teenager at \u00a32.6m when he moved from Charlton to Leeds, that the then Leeds manager Howard Wilkinson described him as having \"a bit of Denis Law about him\", and that he was nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year award in 1999-2000. \"He is a fantastic midfield player,\" one former West Ham player said of Bowyer this week, \"and he has got the best years of his career in front of him.\" And, Roeder has to hope, the days of controversy behind him. Otherwise, forming that four-man England midfield may prove a waste of time.
