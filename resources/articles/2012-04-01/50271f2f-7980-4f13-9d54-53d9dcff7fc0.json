Was it intended or was it a fluke? But Marriott certainly scored in a wind-assisted clearance from inside his own penalty area after 61 minutes.Marriott's kick appeared to be caught by the wind, soared high over the halfway line, then bounced just outside the Wrexham penalty area. The Wrexham keeper, Joslain Mayebi, was off his line and tried to sprint back as the ball bounced over his head and into the net. Bedford-born Marriott joined Mansfield in early 2009 following a spell at Rushden &amp; Diamonds. He started at Tottenham Hotspur as a trainee but was released in 1999 without making a first-team appearance before joining Lincoln City."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
