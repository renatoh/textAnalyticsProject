The Iron Chancellor has finally been pronounced human because, during a television interview last week, he wept at the memory of the death of his baby daughter. Commentators hailed Gordon Brown for revealing his softer side, being in touch with his emotions and cutting a sympathetic figure. Voters, no doubt, will follow suit. No one would dispute that his tears were genuine, but his crying before the cameras was a calculated move. Public tears, especially a man's, were once taboo. Brown and his advisers know that today, soft plays better than stoic. The stiff upper lip served its purpose (the Blitz, the recession), but now the public longs for raw emotions. And nothing beats weeping as proof of emotional engagement. Our confessional culture has become Kleenex culture and the more you cry the better you do, whether on reality TV or in elections. Sympathy vote, surprise element, live entertainment: the man who cries ticks all the requisite boxes. His audience, satisfied on so many levels, can do nothing but enthusiastically support him. This was not always so. A man's tears were once deemed so shocking that the expression 'unmanned by tears' was common currency. TV great Gilbert Harding made headline news by crying on camera when discussing the death of his mother in 1960. And Marlon Brando's blubbing in Last Tango in Paris (1972) provoked more consternation than his character assaulting Maria Schneider with butter. It's a different story nowadays. Tony Blair turns tearful at the drop of a hat, Bill Clinton was forever wiping a tear from one eye and Prince Charles's eyes brimmed as he buried his granny. Even Jeremy Paxman struggled to contain his tears during a documentary earlier this year about his plucky ancestors. It is as if public men now reckon that only by showing us their tears will they convince us of their real strength. It all started with Gazza. Paul Gascoigne cried when he was given a yellow card for a foul against West Germany. It was the World Cup semi-final and millions watched the stocky Geordie blindly weeping. Against the macho backdrop of football, this display by a popular icon kicked masculine tears into national life. Suddenly, everyone discarded the old prejudice that said weeping was for wimps. A good thing, too. Tears are not always genuine. They are not necessarily a sign of a big heart or a gentle soul. But even crocodile tears are preferable to the kind of emotional constipation that stops males from exhibiting any feelings. The hanky man may not be dignified, but at least he is not forced into living the lie that nothing moves him to tears. It's crying men, hallelujah."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
