The watchdog told Britain's dominant airport owner to sell Gatwick, Stansted and either Glasgow or Edinburgh. Christopher Clarke, chairman of the inquiry, said the disposal of Stansted could further delay a planning inquiry that has already been put on hold by ministers pending the outcome of the commission's own report. A new owner may want to build a cheaper second terminal and runway, said Clarke, which would render BAA's planning application redundant. \"The idea of BAA continuing with a planning application when it will not own the asset is a clearly ambiguous position,\" he said, adding that the 2017 opening date for a second runway could be pushed back if passenger numbers continue to deteriorate. The Department for Transport said it remained \"committed\" to its airports policy, including an expanded Stansted. The high-risk \u00a310.3bn acquisition of BAA by Spanish group Ferrovial was unravelling today following the publication of the report. The deal has become one of the cautionary tales of the credit crunch after the Heathrow owner was told to dispose of key assets that it bought near the height of the financial boom in 2006. The commission gave BAA two years to sell three of its seven airports after ruling that its dominance of the market exacerbated poor service for passengers and airlines. BAA has already put Gatwick up for sale but sources close to the process have warned of difficulties in putting together the finance for any such transaction. Colin Matthews, BAA chief executive, refused to rule out appealing against the \"flawed\" final decision today after indicating that the group might struggle to sell three airports in two years. \"Two years suggests a long time but it is not necessarily a long time to complete three transactions in a difficult market environment,\" he said. Matthews confirmed that BAA will use the proceeds to pay down a \u00a312bn debt burden that was imposed on the group by its Spanish owner to finance the 2006 takeover. However, even a successful disposal of all three prized airports would still leave BAA counting the cost of its takeover by Ferrovial three years ago, City analysts are warning. \"They've got a lot of debt \u2013 the sale will help them reduce it, but once you've sold everything, there will still be a pile of debt left over,\" said Andrew Fitchie at Collins Stewart. \"The market has changed. Airport values are falling; people are paying less for assets than they were when BAA was acquired. There's a lot of uncertainty out there and they might struggle to achieve the valuation that they're hoping for.\" The valuations of Gatwick and Stansted are underpinned by a regulatory formula known as the regulated asset base \u2013 or RAB \u2013 which gives Gatwick a minimum value of \u00a31.6bn and Stansted an initial price tag of \u00a31.3bn. Expectations of a big premium to those benchmarks are expected to come under pressure as the recession bites. According to the latest traffic figures, passenger numbers at Gatwick fell 9% last month, with Stansted slipping 10.3% as Glasgow posted a decline of 12% and Edinburgh fell 2.8%. Ferrovial paid about 22% above RAB when it bought BAA, according to a research note by Credit Suisse. Fitchie believes that Gatwick's sale may raise only \u00a31.5bn, as opposed to BAA's initial estimate of \u00a32bn. Lower proceeds and plunging passenger numbers may also put the company near its debt covenant limits, Credit Suisse warned. If the number of passengers falls more than 15%, some of BAA's covenants with its bankers could be breached, but that scenario is far worse than this year's forecast passenger fall of 8%. Covenant breaches leave businesses in the hands of creditors, who can push them into administration or negotiate a new debt restructuring. BAA's lenders, which include Spanish bank Santander and nationalised British bank RBS, have been cooperative, helping with a refinancing last summer and with high levels of capital expenditure. \"They were lucky to secure the refinancing given credit market conditions,\" Fitchie said. One solution to any remaining debt problem would be for banks to swap some of their debt for equity in the company. Debt-for-equity swaps are common among highly indebted companies as a way of avoiding insolvency. Industry observers warned that BAA's concerns over the disposals timeframe will be underpinned by the scarcity of financing. Chris Bosworth, an aviation industry consultant, said the sale process will favour sovereign wealth funds because trade buyers and private equity firms are operating in a depleted credit market. \"Financing is becoming difficult for trade buyers and private equity groups. For instance, airlines are struggling to raise funds to turn aircraft options into firm orders.\" Analysts also warned that the commission's determination to vet every step of the sale process, including whether to allow certain parties to bid, could result in a lower price. \"The disposal process will be very tightly policed and dictated by the commission,\" said Douglas McNeill at Blue Oar Securities. \"It clearly intends to make sure that these disposals happen in the near future. The prices may not be prices that would be considered attractive in normal market circumstances.\" The commission said today's ruling would bring \"substantial benefits\" to passengers. Derision has been heaped on BAA by passengers, airlines and politicians since the terrorism scare of 2006, when its security facilities were overwhelmed by the need to enforce stringent new anti-terror measures. A major plank of the commission's case is that, under new owners, Gatwick and Stansted's attempts to build new runways will have more urgency injected into them \u2013 a process that will take years. \"In the short term it will not make much difference because of the time it will take for the sales to go through. And once that happens, the new owners will need time to get settled in. So it will be further down the line before we see new investment and changes,\" said John Strickland, an airline consultant. BAA, meanwhile, will be reduced to ownership of four airports: Heathrow, Southampton, Aberdeen and either Glasgow or Edinburgh."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
