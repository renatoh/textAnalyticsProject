He was of course delighted to see his missive published a few days later in the paper. What a shame, though, that the Independent didn't find room for Barron's line that he wouldn't take any lectures in succumbing to celebrity culture from a newspaper which had handed editorial control to Bono. They must have run out of space. \u00b7 It is the end of an era at the London Evening Standard, where the paper's TV department is being dismantled and work outsourced to PA. Still, at least the four-strong team from \"London's quality newspaper\" went out on a high at a TV quiz held by the good people of UKTV in Soho last week. The Standard department - all but one of whom are being made redundant - finished first in the quiz, beating the likes of the Radio Times, Daily Express, and Satellite and TV Weekly. The Standard dedicated their win, and a rather attractive silver cup, to the team that came last - PA. \u00b7 Christmas has been cancelled at Sky. Monkey hears the booze-up, formerly known as the Christmas party, due to take place on December 8 has been renamed the \"Winter Party\" after two complaints about the use of the word Christmas. This sort of thing has ex-Sky News regular Richard Littlejohn foaming at the mouth, and it hasn't gone down too well with staff, but management is not for turning. Next they'll be telling us that James Murdoch isn't going to dress up as Santa and leave a stocking at the end of everyone's desks. That really would be a let-down. \u00b7 Thursday was a landmark day for the Times, where a long-held tradition of using foreign honorifics (\u00e0 la Frau Merkel, Senor Zapatero or M. Chirac) has finally been abandoned after a lengthy consultation process launched by Richard Dixon, the chief revise sub, with both London staff and foreign correspondents. The Times had been the only British paper to persist with the practice. Hear that noise? It's the sound of relieved subeditors rejoicing around Wapping. \u00b7 Sky News' most popular stories, 9.30am, Friday: number two, Terror Alert. Number one, Nude Cleaner. \u00b7 To the Telegraph, where the Alex cartoon strip continues to bear an uncanny resemblance to changes going on at the paper itself. After the wailing and gnashing of teeth among staff about Megabank's move to new offices, they are now having to get to grips with a pushy new \"head of cost-cutting\". Uncanny. In the same paper, Craig Brown offers his thoughts on \"10 Things You Didn't Know About the Future of Newspapers\". One reveals that his column will soon be available in a \"bubblecast - with one blow a bubble will appear, containing anything up to 800 humorous words or expressions. Some may argue that bubbles burst, but what do they know?\" It's like a living soap. \u00b7 The unlikely spectre of an NTL/ITV merger got Monkey thinking about the last time NTL shareholder Richard Branson tried to get a piece of ITV. Having failed to persuade Michael Grade to join him 15 years ago, Branson then partnered David Frost for three franchise bids - London weekday, Southern and Anglia - all of which failed at the first fence. There was a general air of bemusement and disapproval at the prospect of the tie-up at a Channel 4 party on Thursday. Channel 4 has bad memories of NTL, when cabling connection problems were blamed as one of the reasons for the failure of Film Four as a pay-TV channel. \"Bit of a comedown for ITV,\" sniffed one Channel 4 exec."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
