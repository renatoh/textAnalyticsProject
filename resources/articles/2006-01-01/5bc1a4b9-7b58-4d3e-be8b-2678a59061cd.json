Why? Because to be a bankable property in all imaginable earthly territories, it must be homogenised. Publishers may be making local variants of coursebooks more of a priority in a number of select (read: profitable) markets, but economies of scale mean that most coursebooks published in the UK are rolled out across the globe with all the grim determination and air-brushed anonymity of a new Mariah Carey album. If you've ever wondered why coursebooks can seem so anodyne, it's because they are designed to be. Sensitivities to potential offence in different territories rule out whole areas of human experience, including references too, which is why teachers and learners become so familiar with units on travel and the weather. There is even a code for this inside publishing: while the mafia relies on the omert\u00e0 - a vow of silence and non-collaboration, ELT publishing swears by the Parsnip. An acronym, of course, standing for : no politics, alcohol, religion, sex, narcotics, isms or pork. Despite acknowledging the homogenising impact of the global market on coursebook content, I'm not saying I would be excited by a radical approach offering a cheeky new menu of Marxism, bacon sandwiches and body piercing. The real issue is not the content, but the delivery mode. Depending on a coursebook to supply the stimulus for language learning is like expecting youth TV to deliver the authentic experience of being young. Youth is about experience, not representation (discuss). Learning a language is about constant experiment, not rehearsal and performance. The raw material for this wonderful experiment is our immediate experience: our daily needs and concerns, hopes and fears. And it's unlikely that someone whose most imaginative ideas have been wrestled to the ground and injected with prescription-strength depressants by the editorial department (and if they don't get you, the marketing people will) is going to know what these are. This is only partly because much of our immediate experience revolves around the secretive world of the Parsnip. It's also because our daily needs and concerns are often repetitive and banal. That doesn't stop us from talking about them in our first language, though - and it needn't stop us doing it in any others. This is in fact the very heart of T-ching: managing a classroom environment in which people become so used to making their own lives the subject of the lesson that the need for any published stimulus diminishes dramatically. And if this kind of gentle and aimless self-disclosure is the name of the new game, what do we do with the coursebook? Allowed within the training audit which teachers are asked to carry out on coursebooks is the contingency for more or less relevant/interesting units, or parts of units, to be left out. In the old days, when units were discrete, and only a couple of pages long, it was relatively easy to do this. Weed them out and move on. Modern coursebooks present the judicious pruner with more of a challenge. The units are longer for a start - mini-epics in their own right. Skip one of them and you've stripped out up to a twelfth of the book's (considerable) market value, especially multiplied across all the relevant material contained in the workbook and CD-Rom. If, moreover, this consideration persuades you to cut and prune from inside a given unit, it's not much easier. Revolution from within runs up against the seamless integration which lies at the heart of the modern coursebook. The text leads to the listening, both lead to the language study, the language study references the text and the listening, and everything is prefaced by preparatory exercises. It as if the texts were explosive materials and no one in the class had ever read or said or heard anything longer than \"good morning\" in their lives, in any language: this is teaching as hand-holding, teaching as neurosis. We are caught in a loop of the coursebook's devising - no wonder it can seem easier to go with the flow. After all, with experience you learn to leaven the coursebook with humour. You develop an instinct for what is a more or less reliable version of our popular grammar rules. You learn to fast forward and pause. You are master of the technology. Or is the technology master of you? Teachers are now armed with such a battery of teaching materials that the lesson can become a logistical challenge rather than a human exchange. Remember that there are innumerable situations in which we teach someone something where it would seem perfectly absurd to plan our interventions in advance. Think children, think friends, think colleagues: passing on expertise as an activity, rather than teaching as a profession, is instinctive. Given effectively, tuition reflects the ability and ambition of the trainee, not the teacher. It isn't impossible to subvert the system from within and use the coursebook a great deal less, even if it is worth your while (and job) to have it in the classroom. The more you teach without a coursebook, the more aware you will be of the energy drop when you do use it. The subversion I'm speaking about here is, in a way, curiously passive. And this is the fourth step of the T-ching. This kind of teaching isn't about impacting on students' lives. It's about allowing the students' lives to impact on us."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
