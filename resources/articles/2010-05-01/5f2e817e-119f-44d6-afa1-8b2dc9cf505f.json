Anyone can see that. The way they look at each other. Finish each other's sentences. But there is scepticism about the Cameron/Clegg love-in among commentators, and rightly so. And Dave's new partner doesn't seem to be finding much favour with the Tory malcontents in Europe. \"Nutters\", Clegg called their allies during the TV debates. They're still angry about it. \"These were particularly offensive remarks \u2026 untrue, incorrect and slanderous, and clearly showed Clegg did not know what he was talking about,\" huffed MEP Martin Callanan to the Parliament Magazine. \"He should establish the facts before he comes out with such stuff.\" And it's true that neither the Tories nor their friends in Europe should be derided as \"nutters\"; indeed, one is loth to describe anyone thus these days, and rightly so. But they are a problem. Nick has found his partner. Think of the Euro-Cons as the troublesome relatives. \u2022 No sign of a comparable attraction between George Osborne and Vince Cable. But then there have been harsh words between them in the past, and the past can so often be a stumbling block to the future. Why are you stealing my ideas? Cable protested to Osborne during one scratchy debate in the house. \"My 10-point plan on debt reappeared as the Conservatives' six-point plan on debt. I had been puzzled as to what was wrong with the other four points.\" Nothing in common. \"My main point of difference with the shadow chancellor at the moment relates to my lack of a sense of humour,\" said Vince. \"I fail to appreciate what is hilarious about the Conservative website describing people who have got into debt as 'feckless tossers'.\" But then he is older than George. Still, even George is older than he used to be. \u2022 A very British revolution, it said on the front page of the Times yesterday, and true it is that many would unpick the election given the opportunity. But we must accept that things are as they are, and that goes for the Times, whose handy website guide Who's who in the Cabinet was yesterday reporting that Gordon Brown is in charge, Des Browne has lost his job as defence secretary, and Peter Mandelson is to be business secretary. We all would turn the clock back to 2008. Forget it. It's gone. \u2022 So that was the first meeting of the Con-Lib cabinet, and can there have been anyone happier than the new home secretary, Theresa May? For years now, says our man in blue, she has been churning out reports on cuddly subjects such as race and gender equality, only to see them suppressed by the higher-ups at Central Office because the right didn't like them and they would have erupted the volcano that is the Daily Mail and Paul Dacre. Yes, it's sod you time to the right, and one assumes that will include Fraser Nelson, political editor of the Spectator, who just last month, writing in the Telegraph, said the new home secretary had \"a nine-year track record of achieving precisely nothing in opposition\". In time she may forgive, but surely she won't forget. \u2022 So David Miliband has thrown his elegant hat into the ring. Balls is hovering. And there's Cruddas with his working-class cap. It's going to be a real battle this time, say the party elders. And already there is the language to match. Ken Livingstone is putting himself about a bit, the better to secure the party's nomination for the London mayoralty. And though physically he was in South Africa \u2013 wittering on about congestion charging \u2013 he found time on Wednesday to assess the race thus far for listeners of the digital station Colourful Radio. \"There's a bigger issue,\" said Ken. \"Peter Mandelson's been working behind the scenes to try and avoid a leadership ballot, in which the ordinary members get a say, to try and shoehorn David Miliband in. The thing about having Ed Balls is it freezes Peter Mandelson out of the politics of the Labour party. His role over the past 20 years has been pernicious and damaging. All that people looking at this from the outside need to know is, Mandelson's backing David Miliband, and Ken Livingstone's backing Ed Balls.\" So the lines are drawn. Let the bloodletting begin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
