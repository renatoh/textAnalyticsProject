This was summed up in the closing stages when R\u00faben Dias somehow hooked the ball clear of the Porto goalline when scoring looked easier for the defender. Still, City\u2019s manager was pleased: this has been a slick qualifying campaign and the final match is now a non-event, allowing Guardiola to focus on domestic affairs until the knockout phase begins. He said: \u201cWe played incredibly well, unfortunately we couldn\u2019t score but we came here to finish first. Now it is time to focus on the Premier League \u2013 we did an incredible group stage \u2013 this is a day to be happy.\u201d Given the needle between Guardiola and Porto\u2019s S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o eyes were on the touchline as well as the pitch. While there were no contretemps, on the field City were confident \u2013 Phil Foden beginning by troubling Wilson Manaf\u00e1 and Chancel Mbemba, which encouraged Oleksandr Zinchenko, at left-back, to move into attack and link with the 20-year-old. Foden\u2019s corner from the right, aimed at Eric Garc\u00eda, won a second kick from the opposite quadrant. Foden trotted over to take and though the Portuguese champions survived they were to remain under pressure. When Zinchenko found the razor-sharp Foden close to Agust\u00edn Marches\u00edn\u2019s goal the youngster was oddly unaware, the ball bouncing off him to safety for the home team. Porto\u2019s first foray into City territory occurred when Garc\u00eda\u2019s loose pass allowed Zaidu Sanusi to rove along the left and a further warning came down the opposing flank when Ot\u00e1vio latched onto a chip and Ederson had to rush out to snuff the danger out. This signalled a shift in the contest, Porto no longer pinned back near their goal. And they gave City a real scare when Diogo Leite\u2019s flick from a long throw had to be saved low by Ederson. Yet Porto were turned due to a rapid counterattack from the visitors. Bernardo Silva led the break, feeding Foden, the youngster\u2019s instant pass from the left rolling precisely into Ferran Torres\u2019s path. He advanced towards the excellent Marches\u00edn but the home No 1 smothered the Spaniard\u2019s shot. City again asserted themselves. Rodri, Jo\u00e3o Cancelo, Silva and Fernandinho tapped the ball between them until suddenly Silva was fashioning a rabona towards Torres and Marches\u00edn had to scramble the ball away. A flurry of chances ensued, Raheem Sterling looked to be clear but Malang Sarr hooked the ball away \u2013 the resulting corner saw Sanusi clear off the line from Sterling. That was the opening period in microcosm: for all their dominance City could not apply the killer touch \u2013 as, with the interval approaching, was again illustrated when two Zinchenko balls into the area were not finished off, and efforts from Rodri and Fernandinho failed to beat Marches\u00edn. As the second half kicked off a telling statistic was how Porto\u2019s keeper had had more touches than any outfield colleague. Cancelo was first to show with a feint but his cross disappointed. At the other end, Ederson\u2019s save from S\u00e9rgio Oliveira was a reminder of how rare any shots on target had been. Zinchenko\u2019s 30-yard free-kick that went straight into Marches\u00edn\u2019s hand was another as a little niggle between the sides occurred, Mateus Uribe shoving Silva over, Rodri having earlier been booked for a wild elbow. Finally, City had a clear chance. Sterling ran to slide home a Foden pass but could not beat the defiant Marches\u00edn, then Torres dawdled over the rebound. Dias\u2019s miss came when Fernandinho sliced the ball to Sterling, who moved it on only for the centre-back to make his inadvertent clearance, Torres\u2019s follow-up overhead-kick also failing to register. Gabriel Jesus had a late strike disallowed for offside in the build-up but this was immaterial, Porto also qualifying. Fernandinho said: \u201cWe tried to win the game from the start, from the first minute and for them it was an important point but what\u2019s important for us is where we are now, ready for the next game.\u201d This is Fulham\u2019s visit to the Etihad on Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
