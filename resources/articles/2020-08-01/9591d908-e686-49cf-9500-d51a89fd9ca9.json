Hanagan is so well known as a Reds fan that when he became champion jockey in 2010, it was arranged for him to be given the trophy by Ian Rush at half-time during a game at Anfield. As Liverpool worked towards a trophy of their own in recent months, Hanagan was struggling to recover from a fall at Newcastle in February that left him with three fractured vertebrae, an injury so grievous he feared his career could be over at the age of 39. \u201cIt certainly helped,\u201d he said of his team\u2019s success during his recuperation. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting a long bloody time for them to lift the trophy, but it was just great to see. I grew up as a Liverpool fan, my sons are Liverpool fans now, my Dad\u2019s a Liverpool fan and his dad was. It\u2019s just memories, isn\u2019t it, of going to the match with your dad. It was just great to see, so chuffed. I was able to enjoy it and it was a great influence to get back in action.\u201d Hanagan\u2019s fall came in a sprint handicap, when Requinto Dawn clipped heels and fell. \u201cYou know when it\u2019s a bad one. I couldn\u2019t get up. That was scary. You can imagine the thoughts going through your mind. I thought, I\u2019m never going to ride again. I just hope I can walk again...\u201d The jockey reached the stage of discussing with his family the question of whether he should retire and some voices were raised in favour. \u201cI asked the specialist, if I do fall off again, which is probably inevitable, how is my back going to be? And it\u2019s going to be just as strong as before. So there\u2019s no worries about that.\u201d Racing Welfare and the sport\u2019s chief medical officer, Jerry Hill, are among those Hanagan wants to thank but his greatest gratitude is for staff at Jack Berry House, the Injured Jockeys Fund facility in Malton, close to his home. He has been rehabbing there every day since it reopened in mid-June and says: \u201cIt sounds crazy but I actually feel like I\u2019m fitter, stronger than I\u2019ve ever been in my career. They\u2019ve been absolutely unbelievable. I couldn\u2019t be in this position now if it wasn\u2019t for Jack Berry House.\u201d Hanagan will return with two rides for his old guv\u2019nor Richard Fahey at Beverley on Tuesday, warming him up for this week\u2019s Ebor meeting at York, which has been the target for his return since the injury. He has also been spurred on by the thought of getting to his 2,000th winner, just a couple of dozen wins away. Might he retire at that point? \u201cOh, no! It\u2019ll be on to the 3,000th, I think.\u201d Monday\u2019s best bets It could be a good day for Tim Easterby at Catterick, where the in-form trainer fields Look Out Louis (1.45). This one has dropped back to a handy rating, 6lb below the one from which he won at Haydock last year, and ran on to be third when stepped up to this distance last time. He\u2019s 4-1. Later, Dandy Story (4.20) should finish strongly at 12-1. She was outpaced early in three tries at Beverley but this stiffer track on rain-softened ground will help her get competitive and the yard has hit form since she last ran. At Uttoxeter, the 9-4 shot Le Grand Rocher (1.35) may be capable of taking a step forward in novice hurdles this season. Lungarno Palace (3.10) went well for Paddy Brennan last time and another good showing should be on the cards at 13-2."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
