Speaking at Sandown after seeing his colt Imperial Monarch take the Classic Trial under his son, Joseph, O'Brien was reluctant to commit the unbeaten winner of last year's Racing Post Trophy to the Guineas. \"It's so far, so good, but we won't force him to do anything. We've always had one eye on the Guineas and we're looking at the race,\" he said. \"Everything is going smooth so far but I'm afraid to commit him. If there's any question then he won't be there. If all those boxes are ticked he'll run.\" Asked whether he had learned anything from his handling of St Nicholas Abbey, another son of Montjeu who finished only sixth when the even-money favourite for the 2000 Guineas two years ago, O'Brien replied: \"You mean the mess I made of him? \"Nick is only coming back now. He lost his brilliance in the spring of his three-year-old career, maybe because we tried to force him. It's only coming back now. He lost it all. It's only now he's starting to quicken like a top horse again, like he did in the Breeders' Cup and in Dubai. Maybe I forced him a bit in the spring.\" O'Brien's comments may to an extent have been aimed at advertising future Coolmore stallion St Nicholas Abbey, but also appeared to reflect genuine fears that the rest of Camelot's campaign could be undermined by a hard race, possibly on testing going, at an early stage of the season. O'Brien junior, on board Camelot for both victories last season, is set to retain the ride at Newmarket presuming he is eventually given the go-ahead to race. The teenager gained plenty of plaudits for his thoughtful ride aboard Imperial Monarch, keeping the favourite wide throughout and forfeiting ground on the home turn before making it all up in the final stages to win going away by one and three-quarter lengths. \"We walked the course before racing and on the outside was where all the tyre tracks were from the vehicles and the ground had become much more compacted there,\" he said. \"I was a good six or eight lengths back on the turn but I was happy with that as I was travelling a lot better than those on the inside.\" The winning trainer refused to take credit for the successful tactics. \"Joseph can make his own mind up,\" he said. \"He knows the horses and he can make the decisions. We didn't say we were definitely going to do it but we'd walked the course together and I can't say I was surprised when he came wide like that.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
