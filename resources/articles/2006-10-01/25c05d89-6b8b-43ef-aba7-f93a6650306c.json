She hits on an angle that has been missed, or she unearths a minor figure who leaps to life irresistibly as she writes. She has done it again with Ernest Jones, Freud's disciple and biographer. Jones does not appear as either trustworthy or even particularly likable, but he is a great character, a man of immense energy and many talents who did well for himself and who performed services for Freud that won him his gratitude and affection. He was the chief exponent of Freud's ideas and practice in England, treating patients by his methods and publishing articles and books promoting the Freudian doctrine. Single-handed, he persuaded the English government to accept Freud and his family as refugees from the Nazis in 1938, and bravely travelled to Vienna to bring them out. After Freud's death Jones, by then in his mid-70s, took on the task of writing the life of his master. The three volumes were greeted in the 1950s as masterpieces of contemporary biography. Jones sprang surprises throughout his life, claiming to have had sexual congress for the first time at the age of six, while at his village school. A super-bright Welsh boy from a modest background, he arrived in London in 1898 to study medicine at University College Hospital, but failed to fit in with the English medical establishment. Like his brilliant contemporary HG Wells, he was small, self-willed, vain, highly sexed and generally irresistible to women. Any prospect of an orthodox medical career in London was ended when he was twice accused of indecent behaviour or talk with children he was examining. He was found innocent of the first charge, but Maddox, sympathetic though she is to him, thinks he was probably guilty. As a good biographer she keeps her sympathy for him even when his behaviour falls short of honour or dignity. By good luck he met a rich and beautiful young Dutch-Jewish woman, Loe Kann, in 1906, just as he had begun to read about the work of Sigmund Freud, \"a man in Vienna who actually listened with attention to every word his patients said to him\", as Jones put it, believing it was an important part of any treatment. Kann shared his interest in psychiatric matters, and became his mistress and benefactress. With her money they travelled abroad. He met Jung and then, in Salzburg, at the first international congress of psychoanalysis, Freud, who invited him to write a book on dreams in English. Unable to find a post in London, Jones was offered a psychiatric one in Canada and persuaded Kann to go with him. He described her as his wife, but they never married. Maddox is good at conveying Jones's intellectual agility and skill in popularising new ideas, and how much his patients liked him. He and Kann both disliked Canadian life, and by 1912 they were in London again. Kann, a morphine addict, was suffering from sexual \"anaesthesia\" (as it was put then) and was eager to be analysed by Freud. He was charmed by this attractive and wealthy patient, and he broke his own rules of confidentiality by discussing her case with Jones and passing on details to another colleague. He gossiped about the tangled situation between what he called \"my adopted children\": Jones was having an affair with Kann's maid, and Freud knew that Kann was falling in love with another man. But Freud valued Jones particularly after his break with Jung, because he believed his doctrines needed a non-Jewish champion, as Jung had been, and almost all the Viennese analysts were Jewish. Jones was happy to take on this role and to deal with the many quarrels and feuds that broke out among the analysts. He loved travelling, lecturing, editing journals and officiating at congresses. He was clear-headed enough to dissuade Freud from talking publicly of his belief in telepathy, and dissuaded him from adopting Lamarkism, knowing that such an allegiance would damage his status among scientists and intellectuals. In 1932 he became president of the International Psychoanalytic Association. After a brief and tragic marriage to a Welsh musician who died after a botched operation for appendicitis, Jones was found a suitable wife by an analyst friend of Freud. Kitty Jokl had been at school with Anna Freud and had good secretarial skills; she was well educated and also Jewish, which appealed strongly to Jones, who had once cherished hopes of marrying Anna. Within hours of their introduction, he proposed to Kitty and she accepted. A month later they were married. The marriage was a complete success and gave them both what they wanted. She translated Freud, helped her husband with his work and gave him emotional security and a family. There were four children, the elder daughter dying tragically young, the elder son, Mervyn, becoming a writer. In Jones's later years he found himself finally accepted by the establishment, becoming a member of the Royal College of Physicians and of the Athenaeum. He received honorary degrees, appeared on television and became almost a celebrity, described by Time magazine as \"a spry homburg-hatted little Welshman\" whom \"Freud called the greatest psychoanalyst in the English-speaking world\". The book tells a cracking story, no doubt. But behind it lies the question about the value of psychoanalysis, to which Jones gave his life and which made him a success. Maddox says in her introduction that she has benefited both in her personal life and in her writing from undergoing analysis. She writes extremely well, with an easy openness and sympathy. But we are still left to ask whether there is any scientific basis to Freud's theories or whether it was just a fad. One of the sanest writers on the subject, the late Anthony Storr, himself an analyst, concluded that the best claim that could be made for psychoanalysis was simply as \"the talking cure\", the giving of time and attention to the distressed and emotionally needy. As such it flourishes and does good work. It does not appear to have changed the world for the better. Freud's ideas have penetrated language and literature, and have encouraged people to be open about their feelings and behaviour. A biography as frank as this one would have been impossible 100 years ago, and indeed Jones's biography of Freud was much less open. Maddox pulls no punches in dealing with either the wizard or his master, and she kept me entertained from start to finish with the very odd story she has to tell. \u00b7 Claire Tomalin's Thomas Hardy: The Time-Torn Man is published by Viking later this month"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
