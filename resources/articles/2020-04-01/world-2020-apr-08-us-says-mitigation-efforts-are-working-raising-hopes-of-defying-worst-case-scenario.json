The taskforce projected on 31 March that the pandemic could claim between 100,000 and 240,000 American lives, even if the federal guidelines were maintained, based in part on evidence from Europe. There is now cautious optimism that the final total, while still high, will be lower. Dr Deborah Birx, the response coordinator, told reporters: \u201cWe carefully looked at Italy and Spain, and we are doing much better in many cases than several other countries, and we\u2019re trying to understand that. We believe that our healthcare delivery system in the United States is quite extraordinary.\u201d One model, run by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington School of Medicine, predicts the virus will kill 60,000 people in the US over the next four months \u2013 about 33,000 fewer than its estimate last Thursday. Birx continued: \u201cThat is modelled on what America is doing. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening and I think what has been so remarkable to those of us who have been in the science field for so long is how important behavioural change is and how amazing Americans are in adapting to and following through on these behavioural changes. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s changing the rate of new cases, and that\u2019s what will change the mortality, because now we\u2019re into the time period of full mitigation that should be reflected within the coming weeks of decreasing mortality. That\u2019s what we really hope to see. We are impressed by the American people.\u201d The public response will change the way scientists look at respiratory diseases and consider what is possible, Birx added. \u201cWe are still in awe, really, of the American people\u2019s strength in this in following through.\u201d Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, added: \u201cThis is a consequence of the commitment of the American people. What\u2019s been remarkable to watch here is how the American public has changed their behaviour when it protects the vulnerable.\u201d And Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the briefing: \u201cRemember, what you do with data will always outstrip a model. You redo your models depending upon your data, and our data is telling us that mitigation is working. So again, as Dr Birx said, keep your foot on the accelerator because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to get us through this.\u201d The taskforce warned against complacency, however, insisting that the advice must still be followed and warning that moving too soon could result in a \u201csecond wave\u201d. After the current guidelines end on 30 April, a battle is looming between cautious public health experts and Trump\u2019s economic team, who are eager to restart. Laura Ingraham, a Fox News host whom Trump name-checked on Tuesday, tweeted: \u201cAt some point, the president is going to have to look at Drs Fauci and Birx and say, we\u2019re opening on May 1. Give me your best guidance on protocols, but we cannot deny our people their basic freedoms any longer.\u201d At Wednesday\u2019s briefing, Trump sounded bullish about the prospects of getting back to business sooner than some had expected. \u201cAspirationally, I said let\u2019s see if we can do it at Easter, but I said it would be very tough, and I was criticised for that. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be very far behind and some of these models are looking like Easter\u2019s going to be a very important date anyway because of the curve. It\u2019s hitting the top and it\u2019s starting to come down.\u201d Trump claimed Louisiana needs far fewer beds than expected, a makeshift hospital at the Javits Center in New York \u201cisn\u2019t too heavily used\u201d and in general \u201cthe numbers are coming way down\u201d. He went on, \u201cI\u2019m not getting called where they need ventilators any more, so we were right on those ventilators\u201d \u2013 though he had taken a call from Senator Cory Gardner in Colorado on Tuesday night requesting a hundred. Such claims are likely to raise fears that Trump is sliding back into complacency, even as states such as New York and New Jersey struggle for ventilators and other equipment. The current US death toll is more than 13,000. Trump was also asked about reports that US intelligence officials warned as far back as late November that the coronavirus was spreading through China\u2019s Wuhan region and posing a severe threat. He said: \u201cWhen I learned about the gravity of it was some time just prior to closing the country to China \u2026 so I don\u2019t know exactly, but I\u2019d like to see the information.\u201d The briefing also strayed into absurdity when a reporter asked whether he would consider a pardon for Joe Exotic, who tried to hire a hit man to kill a rival and whose story is told in the Netflix series Tiger King. \u201cYou think he didn\u2019t do it?\u201d Trump said. \u201cAre you recommending a pardon?\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019ll take a look.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
