But this week, while the All Blacks\u2019 destruction of the Wallabies was on everyones\u2019 lips, there was another topic of conversation: birds. Voting began on Monday in the hotly contested and brutal election of New Zealand\u2019s Bird Of The Year. What started 15 years ago as a modest promotion to draw attention to New Zealand\u2019s native birds, many of which are endangered, has become a phenomenon. Back then an entry page in the NZ Forest &amp; Bird magazine had to be ripped out, filled in and posted. Last year more than 40,000 votes were cast online. As ever, heavyweight names are chiming in. Word is the Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, is backing the black petrel again this year. \u201cShe calls it the Bogan Bird because it dresses in black\u201d says Laura Keown, spokesperson for Bird of the Year 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s a cool bird because it faces a lot of threats. Due to its feeding habits it gets caught as bycatch by commercial and recreational fishers.\u201d There\u2019s been scandal and allegations of vote rigging. In 2008, the successful campaign to elect kakapo was accused by the takahe of accepting undeclared donations \u201cfrom wealthy migratory birds living in Monaco.\u201d Even the odd non-Kiwi gets hooked. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I\u2019ve followed enough New Zealanders to start seeing #BirdOfTheYear posts in my timeline,\u201d Mark Bessey, a software writer residing in Santa Barbara wrote on Twitter. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing some much needed joy (and very weird-looking birds) to my Twitter experience.\u201d Defending champ, the Hoiho, live and breed only in New Zealand. Their numbers have been heading downhill for 30 years and in 2019, only 165 nests were located. In the M\u0101ori language, hoiho means \u2018noisy\u2019, also an apt description of the social media debate about which bird should triumph. When Helen Clark, the country\u2019s former prime minister, declared a few elections ago that she\u2019d voted for the Hoiho, not everyone was thrilled. \u201cHelen, you wot mate? Not gannets?,\u201d responded and incredulous Michelle Langstone, campaign manager for the gannet and inventor of the hashtag #dammitgannet. \u201cGannets are magnificent! This is very disappointing.\u201d Langstone, writer, actor, chip fanatic, won\u2019t be driving the gannet campaign this time but Langstone is squarely in their corner. Put it down to the bruising nature of politics. \u201cI am emotionally drained, and all elections give me hives,\u201d she declared recently on Twitter. Pressed further, Langstone elaborated to The Guardian, \u201cAnd I\u2019ve realised nobody will ever vote for gannets, so I just love them on my own.\u201d She is urging punters to cast all five of their votes for seabirds which she says are \u201clargely overlooked in popularity contests, because they\u2019re mostly offshore, and they smell, and they haven\u2019t got fancy plumage, and many of them are not endangered. But they\u2019re so heroic.\u201d Keown puts the competition\u2019s popularity down to the Kiwi sense of humour. \u201cThey enjoy the frivolity, the fun.\u201d But there is a serious side to proceedings. About 75% of land birds and 90% of seabirds are judged to be threatened or at risk of extinction. Their habitats are being destroyed or degraded by introduced predators, pollution, human development, and climate change. Recent Birds Of The Year include the plump wood pigeon, the Kerer\u016b, with its green, copper and white dreamcoat, that alpine thief, the Kea (it\u2019ll steal your lunch and your bootlaces) and the Forrest Gump of the skies, the bar-tailed godwit which have just returned to New Zealand from Siberia, a non-stop flight of some 12,000 kilometres. No past winner has won again. There\u2019s no rule against it, says Keown. \u201cI think it\u2019s just the heart of New Zealanders that they want to share the love.\u201d Voting closes on 15 November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
