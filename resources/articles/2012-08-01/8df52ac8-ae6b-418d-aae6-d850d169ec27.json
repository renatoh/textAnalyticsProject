N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd chose to base his piece on one of Andersen's less well-known tales, The Will-o'-the-Wisps Are in Town Said the Marsh Witch, for a \"fairytale cantata\" including mezzo soprano, actor, two choirs, drummers and orchestra. Soon after, he produced this chamber version \u2013 amalgamating the roles of the mezzo and the actor, boiling the score down to five instrumentalists, and transforming the choral numbers into arias. In this version, the soloist (the brilliant Helene Gjerris) alternates between narrating Andersen's tale, and singing the arias, which are settings of poems by Suzanne Br\u00f8gger that project Andersen's tale into the 21st century. It's a fascinatingly approachable piece, sometimes recalling Pierrot Lunaire or The Soldier's Tale, but more often conjuring up its own, rather quirky fairytale world, full of typical N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd gestures and slithering harmonic allusions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
