Rodham\u2019s age was not immediately known but he was born in 1954, six years after Clinton, 71, and four years after the other Rodham sibling, Hugh, 69, in the Chicago suburbs. \u201cWe lost my brother Tony last night,\u201d Clinton wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find words, my mind is flooded with memories of him today. When he walked into a room he\u2019d light it up with laughter.\u201d Clinton described her brother as \u201ckind, generous [and] a wonderful husband to Megan [and] father to Zach, Simon [and] Fiona\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ll miss him very much,\u201d the former senator, secretary of state, first lady and presidential candidate said. She did not say how her brother died. Rodham attended but never graduated from Iowa Wesleyan College and the University of Arkansas. In adult life he was best known for his general consulting work but he was also a prison guard, a private investigator, a repo man, an investor and an insurance salesman. His first marriage, to Nicole Boxer, daughter of former California senator Barbara Boxer, was held in the White House Rose Garden in 1994, while Bill Clinton was president and Rodham was working for the Democratic National Committee. The couple divorced in 2001 and Rodham remarried in 2005. Rodham helped on his sister\u2019s 2008 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. He was not deeply involved with Clinton\u2019s campaign for the White House in 2016, CNN reported, although he did stump with her at events in Pennsylvania. According to a New York Times report in 2015, like his brother Hugh, Rodham sometimes drew scrutiny for allegedly \u201cleveraging his ties\u201d to his sister and her husband, Bill Clinton. \u201cIt can go both ways,\u201d Rodham said in 1999, of his relationship with his famous sister and her husband. \u201cThere\u2019s some wonderful things that have happened to me because of my relationship with Hillary and Bill, and there\u2019s been some really terrible things that have happened to me.\u201d The same year, the White House publicly rebuked Tony and Hugh Rodham for a business venture in which they planned to export hazelnuts from the former Soviet Republic of Georgia with the help of Aslan Abashidze, the leading political rival of then Georgian president and Clinton ally Eduard Shevardnadze. \u201cIf in fact this project is still going forward, we don\u2019t approve and will continue to make clear to Georgian officials that this venture has no connection with or sanction from the US government,\u201d White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said at the time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
