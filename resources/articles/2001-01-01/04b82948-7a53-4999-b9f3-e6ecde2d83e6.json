Wise almost left Chelsea, where he has been a fixture for more than a decade, to join Blackburn. He stayed after impassioned pleas from chairman Ken Bates, chief executive Colin Hutchinson and team-mate Gianfranco Zola whose relationship with Wise, according to the Stamford Bridge grapevine, had recently become strained. Now Observer Sport understands that Fulham are monitoring Wise's situation and are prepared to make him a generous offer in the summer - including the captaincy of the side. By then the runaway First Division leaders should have cemented a place in the Premiership. Owner Mohamed Al-Fayed is backing manager Jean Tigana's team-building plans and Wise has been earmarked as precisely the sort of experienced Premiership campaigner to complement Craven Cottage's blossoming mix of young foreign stars and domestic talent keen for another crack at the elite. Meanwhile, Chelsea are said to be keen to sign South African central defender Pierre Issa from Marseille on loan for the rest of the season, allowing Frank Leboeuf to join Monaco."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
