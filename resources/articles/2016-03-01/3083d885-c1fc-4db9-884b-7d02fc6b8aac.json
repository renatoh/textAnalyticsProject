Wasted a good chance on the right but was a constant threat with a huge boot. 14 Wesley Fofana 6/10 Did not see a great deal of the ball but more to do with a lack of sharpness than being stranded on the wing. Will improve, and so will France as a result. 13 Ga\u00ebl Fickou 7/10 Clattered by Watson early on but showed no ill-effects with some sharp footwork. Has moved up a gear under his ex-club coach Guy Nov\u00e8s. 12 Maxime Mermoz 6/10 Made one scything break down the middle and his understanding with Fickou continues to improve. Provides a bit of solidity to a capricious backline. 11 Virimi Vakatawa 8/10 Roasted Nowell twice early on. He gets spectators off their feet and if he improves defensively France have a considerable talent on their hands. 10 Fran\u00e7ois Trinh-Duc 5/10 A promising start came to an abrupt end when picking up an ankle injury in the build-up to Care\u2019s try. France\u2019s hopes limped off with him. 9 Maxime Machenaud 8/10 On kicking duties \u2013 performed with the sort of accuracy France have cried out for \u2013 and rarely missed a beat at scrum-half. Must do it more often. 1 Jefferson Poirot 4/10 Culpable for Care\u2019s try and was exposed at scrum time. International career will not be a long one unless he makes swift progress. 2 Guilhem Guirado (capt) 7/10 Angered that Cole\u2019s try stood and he played like it thereafter. He could do with a few of his team-mates following his lead more often. 3 Rabah Slimani 5/10 Loss of form as the tournament has progressed does not chime with his undoubted class. Threw himself into tackles in the first half though. 4 Alexandre Flanquart 5/10 Lineout struggled again against Kruis and Itoje. At 6ft 9in Flanquart should be more dominant but it was no surprise when he was hooked for Jedrasiak. 5 Yoann Maestri 6/10 Touted as the next captain this time last year and has played like he has had the hump ever since. Put in a good shift at the breakdown though. 6 Damien Chouly 6/10 Much happier on the blindside. Does not carry with any great authority but made countless tackles, plenty of them on Billy Vunipola. 7 Bernard Le Roux 7/10 Restored to bring ballast and did exactly that. Takes plenty of the credit for such an improved defensive performance from France. 8 Loann Goujon 7/10 Called upon to provide the muscle to combat Billy Vunipola and stuck to the task admirably. Only major fault is that he is not Louis Picamoles. REPLACEMENTS Jules Plisson 6/10 (for Trinh-Duc 13) Kept things simple Uini Atonio 6/10 (for Poirot 57) At 23st, he got stuck in as expected Xavier Chiocci 5/10 (for Slimani 57) Fared better than man he replaced until blatant yellow card Paul Jedrasiak 5/10 (for Flanquart 57) Gave away needless penalty Camille Chat 6/10 (for Guirado 66) Very highly rated but not much time to show why Maxime M\u00e9dard 5/10 (for Mermoz 69) Few chances to shine Wenceslas Lauret 6/10 (for Loann Goujon 69) Made his tackles S\u00e9bastien B\u00e9zy 5/10 (for Machenaud 75) Hardly any involvement ENGLAND 15 Mike Brown 5/10 Typically tenacious and made an early break on the left but pass to Care was shocking. Needs to improve distribution and decision-making. 14 Anthony Watson 7/10 May find himself in hot water for first-minute challenge on Fickou. Has a sidestep to die for and that keeps defenders honest. Took try well. 13 Jonathan Joseph 6/10 A marked man and perhaps he has been figured out a bit but he does suffer with England too lateral. Much improved defensively, though. 12 Owen Farrell 7/10 Solid from the tee but was given the slip by Spedding and is often guilty of getting and giving too early \u2013 unsurprising as No12 is not his position. 11 Jack Nowell 7/10 Edgy debut here two years ago and certainly up against it facing Vakatawa but responded well. Ability to wriggle out of tackles is uncanny. 10 George Ford 7/10 Still not at his best, when his tail is up and his eye is in, but did not shy away when pressure was on. Credit to Eddie Jones for sticking with him. 9 Danny Care 6/10 Was excellent here two years ago and his try demonstrated precisely why he was picked. Box-kicking, as ever, has room for improvement 1 Mako Vunipola 5/10 Held his end up at the scrum but with England unable to blast France away early on perhaps he was better suited to coming off the bench. 2 Dylan Hartley (capt) 6/10 Flawless at the lineout but perhaps felt the strain a bit, he had been in this position twice before and failed. Head injury looked horrible. 3 Dan Cole 6/10 Took his widely contested try, his second in 64 Tests, superbly. Gives away the odd penalty but he can be happy with his championship. 4 Maro Itoje 7/10 Got better as the tension went up a notch which shows why he is so highly thought of but, continuing the motoring theme, not quite firing on all cylinders. 5 George Kruis 9/10 Leads lineout with the authority of a seasoned international and performs duties at the restart with similar confidence. The standout performer. 6 Chris Robshaw 7/10 Would still be out there tackling until tomorrow if Jones asked him. Does so much dirty work and it is a role that suits him far better. 7 James Haskell 5/10 There were rumours a back spasm was going to rule him out just before kick-off and he did not seem right. Not at abrasive best but does not give up. 8 Billy Vunipola 8/10 Well shackled but when he finally built up a head of steam Watson was going over moments later. Player of the tournament by some distance. REPLACEMENTS Joe Marler 7/10 (for M Vunipola ht) Relished a belated return to the pitch after a turbulent week Ben Youngs 8/10 (for Care 44) Brought more authority than his rival and the grubber for Watson\u2019s try was lovely Luke Cowan-Dickie 6/10 (for Hartley 68) Stayed calm in heat of battle coming on for stricken colleague Jack Clifford 5/10 (for Robshaw 75) No time to shine but chance will come, probably in Australia over summer"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
