Had the weather turned seven days earlier, Sea The Stars might have been at home in Ireland on Sunday afternoon, and 50,000 racegoers at Longchamp would have been denied a vision of brilliance that we will carry with us to the grave. Similar random factors will be on the minds of Sea The Stars' connections as they decide whether to send him to California to contest the Breeders' Cup Classic on 7 November. There are risks involved with getting any racehorse to the other side of America, even one with an easy-going attitude. There are risks too every time a horse runs at racing speed, surrounded by others doing the same. A switch from the European autumn to the heat of Santa Anita is another fresh obstacle to overcome. These risks are all relatively slim, but when a horse has won six Group Ones on the trot, why take any chances at all? It is an argument that may well carry the day. \"My gut instinct is that after the hard season the horse has had, with six races in six months, America is probably a step too far but we haven't ruled it out,\" his trainer, John Oxx, said yesterday. \"It's two weeks before we have to make an entry for him and a decision will be made around that time.\" Oxx and Mick Kinane, the jockey, seemed on Sunday to see only negatives in a trip to Santa Anita, as if preparing for Sea The Stars' immediate retirement. But the answer, as with most things in racing and life in general is that a risk is worth taking if the possible reward is sufficient. And the potential reward in the Classic is almost beyond calculation. It is not merely prize-money, though five million bucks is five million bucks. In terms of Sea The Stars' value as a stallion, the Classic is a shot to nothing, a race that can only increase his desirability to breeders. They have four weeks to rehearse the reasons why he may be beaten, and perhaps 20 years after that to remind everyone about his crowning moment should he win. Defeat, meanwhile, would be disappointing, but nothing more. It did not detract from the memory of Galileo, Giant's Causeway or Dancing Brave, who all failed at the Breeders' Cup, two of them in the Classic, and nor would it with Sea The Stars. This all depends, of course, on how he has reacted to his latest race but, despite Kinane's suggestion the colt's winter coat is imminent, he did not look to be crying out for a break. Indeed, his frame is now crammed with muscle, and on looks you would think he was a speed horse rather than a stayer \u2013 another reason to allow American breeders to see him in the flesh. American racing is currently engaged in a slow, painful switch from dirt to artificial surfaces, which offers scope for Sea The Stars to be the first super-horse of the all-weather era. Had he emerged in 2010, when the Breeders' Cup will return to dirt at Churchill Downs, he would be an ex-racehorse already, as Oxx would never entertain the possibility of running him on dirt. It is only the fact that Santa Anita has a Pro-Ride surface that makes a run in the Classic a possibility. In other words, there are sporting reasons to go to America as well as commercial ones. Racing needs horses like Sea The Stars, now more than ever. It is asking too much to see a \u00a350m horse race on at four. One more outing in a race that might have been designed with him in mind is not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
