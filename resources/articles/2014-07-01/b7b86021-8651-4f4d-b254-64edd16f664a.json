Do not read on unless you have watched episode 12. Read Stuart's episode 11 blog here Previously on 24 In the space of 11 hours, Jack Bauer has managed to infiltrate the CIA, defeat Catelyn Stark's evil drone plot, save London from destruction, lead the US president to \u2013 and subsequently rescue him from \u2013 a colossal explosion, arrest a high-ranking CIA official for treason, reconnect with an old girlfriend and indirectly bring about the murder of yet another Russian politician. Now, still wanted by the Russians, he has to singlehandedly locate his Chinese arch-nemesis in order to stop global nuclear armageddon. And he's only got one hour to do it. Or 13 hours. Look, nobody really knows how this episode is going to work. Onwards! 10:00 - 10:09 We begin in the home of Walrus Vagina, which LadyBauer and Boudreau are fruitlessly ransacking for clues to help them find Cheng. Luckily, Jack knows that the best way to find clues is to arbitrarily walk up to a piece of furniture and punch it until a secret phone magically appears. It works, but then Cheng calls. His message is clear \u2013 Audrey will be shot dead by a sniper as soon as anyone tries to stop him. So, naturally, Jack immediately tries to stop him. Boudreau appeals for Audrey's life by croaking, \"She loves you,\" at Jack, at which point Kiefer Sutherland spins around, does the single best onscreen finger-point since his dad starred in Invasion of the Body Snatchers and screams: \"SHUT UP!\" Eventually a plan is hatched \u2013 LadyBauer will rescue Audrey, Jack will take out Cheng, and Boudreau will just sit there with his thumb up his arse because he's a big baby. Time-jump? 10:13 - 10:20 Nope. Because at Southampton docks, Cheng and his men meet Walrus Vagina's contact, a Russian sailor who also has a moustache that looks like a walrus's vagina. Surely this cannot be a coincidence. Maybe that's how the sailor met the minister in the first place, at a Spectacularly Genital-Looking Facial Grooming convention in Vladivostok. The sailor leads Cheng to his escape vessel. Time-jump? 10:24 - 10:32 Nope. Despite it being almost two hours away by car, Jack somehow manages to arrive in Southampton within about 10 minutes of leaving London, and promptly starts taking out all of Cheng's men. Chloe \u2013 having convinced Jack that she didn't know how evil Julian Assange was, despite him wearing cravats and talking like Dr Claw from Inspector Gadget \u2013 assists him by hacking into some sort of infrared drone (because drones aren't bad if you use them to murder Chinese people) and Metal Gear Soliding him to the deck of the boat. At this point, Cheng realises that Jack is after him and sets sail for Russia. And Jack \u2013 even though he's now on a boat that has been commandeered by his torturer and steaming towards a country where he's wanted for the mass murder of its entire government \u2013 doesn't even flinch. That's how hardcore Bauer is. Meanwhile, LadyBauer rescues Audrey from the clutches of the sniper. But then another of Cheng's gunners leaps out from behind a bin. Audrey is hit. And, despite LadyBauer repeating the phrase \"stay with me\" about 16 times, Audrey dies. She's definitely dead, too \u2013 there's a silent clock and everything, which rules out the possibility of an annoying twist where it turns out that she actually looped the gunfight and escaped in a car or whatever it is that her dad did the other week. Goodbye, Audrey. You had genuinely terrible taste in men. Time-jump? 10:36 - 10:46 Nope. LadyBauer phones Jack to tell him that Audrey died, and Jack immediately goes to a very dark place. He realises that he's cursed. With barely any exceptions, everyone he loves ends up dead. Knowing that he can't go on ruining lives like this, Jack pulls out a pistol and silently prepares to end his own life. But then he hears a Chinese accent and realises that violent revenge always trumps suicide. A little revenge perspective: when Renee (a woman he'd slept with once) died, Jack more or less wiped out a superpower's entire government. But Audrey was one of his great loves \u2013 a woman he'd been involved with on and off for more than a decade \u2013 which means that all of China should probably retreat to their panic rooms this instant. Jack stands up and shoots about nine baddies at once while shouting \"Yaaar!\" like a pirate. He flings a meat cleaver through another baddie's chest. He stabs Cheng's right-hand man in the throat and shoots another raft of them. Now the only men left alive are left are Jack and Cheng, and this is the perfect stage for an old-fashioned Star Trek-style fistfight. They match each other blow for blow. Cheng lets off a fire extinguisher in Jack's face. Jack break's Cheng's arm. Jack punches Cheng unconscious. Jack knees Cheng in the face twice. Jack punches Cheng some more. To be honest, Jack's probably won this one. Cheng's capture convinces the Chinese president to call off world war three, just in the nick of time. Unfortunately, Jack and Cheng just so happen to be in a room full of samurai swords, so Jack takes the cosmic hint and chops Cheng's head clean off. But anyway, war is over! President Heller is a hero! His moment of glory lasts for approximately half a second, though, because then someone tells him that Audrey is dead, and he faints. At this point, bang on cue, Boudreau pulls the biggest \"Oh, shit\" face of his entire life. Jack clambers off the boat to celebrate with Chloe, but she's gone missing. His phone rings. Jack says: \"I'll be there.\" Which means \u2026 Time-jump! It's now 12 hours later, and everyone is miserable. LadyBauer resigns from the CIA. Boudreau is in custody, where he'll be tried for treason and probably executed. Heller escorts Audrey's body on to Air Force One. When he reaches America, he will resign. Prime minister Stephen Fry offers one last sympathetic jowl wobble, and Heller tries to comfort himself with the knowledge that at least his dementia will wash in soon and irreparably steal away all his grief. It is an outstandingly bleak ending for a terrific series. But wait. Elsewhere, a helicopter lands. Jack approaches it, with snipers trained on him from every angle. Inside is Kevin McNally, who is Russian now. He's the one who abducted Chloe. He'll only release her if Jack hands himself in. Jack tells Chloe that she's his best friend, boards the helicopter and heads to Moscow to face justice for all the atrocities he has committed in the name of justice. Silent clock. The end. Notes \u2022 Wait, a silent clock? Does this mean that the Russians are going to kill Jack? Or maybe, judging by the quarter-smile on his face, that Jack will strangle the helicopter pilot and die in a crash? Either way, can this really be the end of 24? \u2022 I think the moral of this season, based on the last scene, is: \"Never have best friends.\" \u2022 What a brilliant season this was, though. Easily good enough to banish the dark memories of six, seven and eight. In fact, I might be bold enough to put this in the top three seasons of 24 ever. More, please. \u2022 One disappointment: Stephen Fry's Obviously Evil Special Adviser Miranda Raison didn't turn out to be very evil at all. In fact, she barely even did anything. Would it have been too much trouble to get a subplot where she left rotting fish behind President Heller's radiator or something? \u2022 Thank you all so much for the comments you've provided throughout this series. It's been a joy to have you here. Meet back here if Jack somehow cheats death? \u2022 I still miss Basher, though."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
