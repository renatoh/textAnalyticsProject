For the non-initiated this is the show that lets you experience all the hell of a dinner party without having to pick a designated driver. The cast is more or less unchanging; a chubby woman with dyed blonde hair, in her early 40s, wearing the entire contents of a small branch of H Samuel the jeweller, with dialogue she seems to have stolen from Carry On Cabby, a camp straight guy, a sad thin woman, and a fourth one, the Ringo if you like. A voiceover shouts at you, telling you when you should laugh. My wife's always watching it, not just on 4 but on E4, More4, Yet More4 and Oh My God, Not Even More4. The programme defines Channel 4 for me; that, reruns of Friends and panel games with Jimmy Carr and a few other intermittently mildly amusing comedians sitting behind a desk commenting on the week's news. So the Paralympics has broken the mould for the channel and in some ways reconnected it with its past. Quirky sports coverage used to be a speciality of 4; Football Italia, American football, sumo wrestling and even kabaddi, once found a home there. Clearly the key to televising the Paralympics is to hold the quirky and celebrate the athletic excellence, in which Channel 4 was at least halfway successful. Most of the cavilling about its work seemed to me to be simply complaining that Channel 4 is not the BBC. The BBC's Olympics coverage was more polished and proper. The BBC spent seven years preparing it. Once the Games were won a senior executive was put in charge and could call on the corporation's vast resources to ensure the bang-up job it delivered. Channel 4's content came from an independent company whose priority, one assumes, is ensuring black rather than red ink on the monthly statement. People complained about the primacy of chat over live action and the constant plugs for Sainsbury's, which is rather like moaning that apples were not publicly funded oranges. My personal beef was the overuse of montages over a soundtrack of what the best available sources tell me is urban grime, a genre that if I am ever called upon by Kirsty Young I shall be sure to leave behind. That aside, I think Channel 4 did a pretty decent job and even discovered a star in Alex Brooker, who I suspect will not want for offers to continue his career in sports broadcasting. The engaging Brooker played second banana to the eponymous host of Adam Hills' Last Leg, the nightly chat show-highlights programme. Both Brooker and Hills have prosthetic limbs, so shared amusing detachable body part stories, while answering knotty questions about treatment of the disabled in these confusing times. \"Is it OK,\" asked one viewer, \"to kneel down when you have your picture taken with Ellie Simmonds?\" Another wanted athletes to have their disability printed on their shirts if it was not immediately obvious. Hills, Brooker and the comedian Josh Widdicombe, third banana on the show, agreed the correspondent had a point and suggested the system be extended to everyday life, with slogans such as \"Fears Commitment\" and \"Thirty-three per cent of people who know him think he's a nob\" printed on T-shirts, like cigarette packet warnings. As front man, Hills radiated charm and had some great anecdotes. I particularly liked his story of the Aussie who lost both legs in a car crash, went on to win Paralympic gold, was asked by an interviewer if that had always been a dream and replied: \"Well, not when I had my bloody legs, mate.\" What with Last Leg and Paralympic Breakfast, there may have been too much chat overall \u2013 I fear my appetite for hearing how \"amazing\" the atmosphere was and how \"it hasn't really sunk in yet\" may now be sated \u2013 but I suppose that is inevitable with so many remarkable stories to be told. And if ever there was an excuse for a slightly over-the-top celebratory tone, this was it. I am tempted to say the next step is a Paralympics Come Dine With Me but they have of course already done one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
