The answer is fundamentally important for the future not only of Northern Ireland but democracy on this island. Judging by the standard of debate, the turnout and the large number of people aged under 25 in the audience of an upstairs room in a Dublin pub last Thursday night, the response to that key question is 'well, maybe'. The topic debated at Doheney and Nesbitt's in Baggot Street was policing and the Patten Report - the issue which perhaps more than any other finally puts clear green water between the SDLP and Sinn Fein after the years of Hume/Adams and pan-nationalism. The former has decided to take its seats on the north's new policing board and will urge young Catholics to join the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The latter says it will 'actively discourage' nationalists from signing up to the PSNI. Thus the battle lines are drawn in a struggle which will either save or see off the SDLP. Imagine six months from now when the drive is on to recruit young Catholics. During last Thursday's meeting, I described for the assembled SDLP, Labour and Fianna Fail members and supporters what this might entail. What happens, for instance, when PSNI recruitment officers want to talk to secondary school pupils in west Belfast? Alex Attwood will have to stand alone as the only Assembly member in the constituency who supports the new service's access to the area's Catholic schools. There will be pickets at schools and SDLP constituency surgeries, veiled and even explicit threats to staff and students. In short, it will be hell for those in the nationalist community who have embraced the new service. Policing, or more importantly the freedom to join a new police service, will test the mettle of the new SDLP under Mark Durkan, and undoubtedly push the already strained relations between the two nationalist parties to breaking point. During my speech I reminded the SDLP that every successful party needs a big idea, especially if it is to attract fresh blood. The Shinners' message is crude but incredibly effective. The party is 'making history'; it is 'greening the west' and re-drawing the border. To put it another way, it is on a historic mission. The trouble of course with messianic notions such as national destiny is that ordinary people get crushed under history's wheels, which is exactly what happened for 30 wasted years in Northern Ireland. To counter the seductive historicism of Sinn Fein, the SDLP should promote two 'big ideas' of their own: freedom and, paradoxically, the battle of history. The freedom part is easy. Freedom to join the police service; freedom from paramilitary intimidation; freedom to think differently in communities where having the wrong political ideals means you don't get a job; freedom for sporting organisations like the GAA to allow police officers to play their games. The battle of history is more problematic. This weekend Ireland will be subjected to a cynical circus of necrophilia (the Mountjoy 10's re-burial at Glasnevin) which could backfire on Bertie Ahern. I hope it doesn't, given Bertie's balanced and reasonable approach to northern policy. Yet I strongly suspect that the Taoiseach might end up like one of those British Egyptologists who opens the mummy's tomb and ends up living under a curse for the rest of his life. For there is one thing which the SDLP must have learnt by now regarding the republican movement - you can't out-Shinn the Shinners. There is, however, one historical project that constitutional nationalism should pursue, and that is to consistently question the moral validity of the IRA's 30-year-old campaign. For at pre sent there is a sinister rewriting of history taking place on the political, intellectual and cultural battlefields. You see it in Robert Ballagh's commemorative portrait of the 1981 hunger strike with its 10 white doves breaking free from a smashed H block. Now the hunger strikers have been many things to many people but they certainly were not doves, particularly the three INLA members who died and are now written out of this new narrative. Francis Hughes' bombs for example decapitated a nine-year-old girl, hardly the action of a dove. Hughes and his comrades did not die for the peace process, parity of esteem or powersharing. They killed and were killed for nothing less than a united Ireland. The SDLP has one single devastating argument that it failed to deploy during the years of the peace process. What the hell were the last three decades for then? That message - of wasted lives and futility- has to be transmitted to a new generation now being nurtured on falsehoods and lies. In essence, the SDLP's intellectual project post-Hume is to tell the truth about the Troubles. henry.mcdonald@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
