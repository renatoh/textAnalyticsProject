Thoughts with Andr\u00e9 Gomes, who Marco Silva has confirmed was taken by ambulance to hospital: A classy snippet from Pochettino in his press conference regarding a classy touch from the Everton skipper. \u201cI want to thank the captain, S\u00e9amus Coleman \u2013 he came into the dressing room to console Son,\u201d the Spurs manager said. Marco Silva confirms Andr\u00e9 Gomes has gone to hospital. \u201cOur medical staff is taking control of everything and soon there will be more information,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wait until it is a bit more clear. It is a bad moment for us as a group and as a team. It more than a football game, this is the most important thing right now. We as a group have to keep togetherness.\u201d Fabian Delph, understandably, found it difficult to keep his emotions in check. \u201cWe feel just as you can imagine,\u201d says a deflated Delph. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult time for us. He [Andr\u00e9 Gomes] is one of our brothers, someone we care about. It is difficult to put into words how we feel. As soon as we could get in touch we will send him our best. It\u2019s difficult to see. It\u2019s hard to talk now. \u201cOur thoughts are with Andr\u00e9, we all want to see him as soon as possible. He\u2019s such a good guy, such a good professional. It\u2019s hard to put into words. When it happened, it is hard to refocus. We buckled down and were desperate to get something out of the game. It was a big push. Mind is muffled, we are happy to get the point but I am not thinking of the result, we are all just thinking of Andr\u00e9. It\u2019s a difficult time for us, especially for him. We will give him all of our support.\u201d Word from the Premier League on the Son sending off. In a statement released a moment ago, they say: \u201cThe red card for Son was for endangering the safety of a player which happened as a consequence of his initial challenge.\u201d Marco Silva talks, and is reluctant to talk too much about the injury to Andr\u00e9 Gomes, stating he only saw the incident live. \u201cWe showed a fantastic team spirit, if you can talk about the game. There were many, many stops that did not help the game or the performance. I think we deserved a little bit more, in the second half we were more balanced and they didn\u2019t create anything. Until the goal they scored, we had the two big, big chances. After, one mistake, one counterattack and maybe the only time they went in our area. After we reacted, we had some chances to equalise and we showed that spirit to come back.\u201d More from Pochettino. He says Son Heung-min is devastated and adds that the referee Martin Atkinson should have checked the VAR screen to realise his challenge was not red-card worthy. \u201cSonny was devastated,\u201d Pochettino says. \u201cIt was difficult to keep calm. When you watch the action on TV, there is no intention to do what happened after. It was very, very bad luck for him and bad luck for the family of Everton. It finished with a red card for Sonny, very unfair and of course the conditions of the game changed. We defended well but then we conceded. I am disappointed with the result, and disappointed with other things that happened in the 90 minutes. I cannot agree with the sending off of Sonny and many things that happened before. I think the referee needs to go to the screen, like in different leagues.\u201d Read Andy Hunter\u2019s report from Goodison Park: Mauricio Pochettino speaks, and sends his best wishes to Andr\u00e9 Gomes. \u201cWe feel very sorry, we feel very sorry because it was a really bad situation,\u201d he says, after puffing his cheeks. \u201cIt was very bad luck how he landed in the action. We can only send our best wishes and of course we are devastated for the situation. Football is not important but the situation of him is important. Of course we can talk about football but always feeling bad, feeling sorry and very devastated for the action.\u201d Asked whether recent criticism stings, Alli replies: It depends who from. There are certain people that obviously when they something it hurts and it really kicks you up the backside and certain people who say stuff and you just roll your eyes at it and it\u2019s in one ear and out of the other. Growing up, coming from League One into the Premier League, you have to have a strong mentality you have a strong mentality. Granted I didn\u2019t have the best of seasons last season, I picked up a few injuries or whatever but that\u2019s all behind me now and I\u2019m working hard. Maybe last week against Liverpool I didn\u2019t perform as well as I can but I think in the other games, Watford and in the Champions League, I think I\u2019ve played well. People always say \u2018can Dele get back to where he was?\u2019 But I don\u2019t want to get back to where I was, I want to go past that and keep improving. Some people just say it [criticism] because it\u2019s their job to say something.\u201d Dele Alli speaks, and very well too. Of the injury to Andr\u00e9 Gomes, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s not nice, I didn\u2019t want to look too much at what happened but I just want to send him our best wishes. He is an amazing footballer. I just went into the changing room and he [Son Heung-min] is devastated, he is in tears but it\u2019s not his fault. He is one of the nicest people you will ever meet and he would never mean to do something like that. He cannot even pick his head up, he is crying that much. It does play on your mind [in the game] but you have to stay professional, focus and switched on. Unfortunately we switched off for a split second and they scored.\u201d It is very much secondary given the injury to Andr\u00e9 Gomes \u2013 but it has to be said that the video assistant referee technology had a bit of a stinker. It was an understandable human error by Martin Atkinson and the officials to award Son Heung-min a red card on the back of the agony the Everton midfielder found himself in but, on closer inspection, his challenge was in no way worthy of a red. Which is precisely when technology should surely intervene ... Cenk Tosun cancelled out a fine Dele Alli opener \u2013 but all thoughts from both teams will be with Andr\u00e9 Gomes at the final whistle. The Everton midfielder was carried off on a stretcher after sustaining a serious-looking injury. Son Heung-min was sent off for fouling Andr\u00e9 Gomes, but replays appear to show that the injury was not as a result of that challenge but rather because how the midfielder awkwardly fell. Alli\u2019s opener was timely, in front of the watching Gareth Southgate, who names his England squad on Thursday, but by the end it was a distant memory, after Tosun powered in Digne\u2019s cross to equalise. There was also a long VAR check for a possible Everton penalty after Alli seemingly handled in the box but, after a three-minute delay and numerous checks, play continued. 101 min: Ryan Sessegnon is on for his Spurs debut, in place of Christian Eriksen. Sessegnon\u2019s first touch? A crucial headed clearance. 100 min: Ten-man Spurs are suddenly hanging on. Everton are level \u2013 and it\u2019s a brilliant goal. Tosun powers home a header, meeting Lucas Digne\u2019s brilliant volleyed, first-time cross. It was a wonderful floating cross into Digne by Yerry Mina, who lost his footing after sending the ball across the field. Digne fired the ball into the box, where Calvert-Lewin and Tosun were both champing at the bit, and Tosun did the rest. 90+5 min: Delph is penalised for a challenge on Lo Celso. Spurs win a free-kick on halfway. Seven minutes to play at Goodison. 90+2 min: The game, as you would expect, has gone very flat after that horrifying injury to Andr\u00e9 Gomes. That Son was distraught and the distress of both sets of players and the crowd speak volumes of the severity of the injury. Goes without saying, but all thoughts with Andr\u00e9 Gomes. 90 min: There will be 12 added minutes. 88 min: Juan Foyth replaces Aurier for Spurs, who are down to 10. 86 min: Sigurdsson and Calvert-Lewin are on for Everton. Tom Davies was withdrawn, while Andr\u00e9 Gomes was carried off through injury. 84 min: Now is perhaps not the time to address it but replays show Son\u2019s challenge was worthy of a yellow card at most. It appears the way Andr\u00e9 Gomes awkwardly landed on the turf was why the concern around him was so serious \u2013 not the manner of Son\u2019s challenge. 83 min: Andr\u00e9 Gomes is carried off on a stretcher. Marco Silva\u2019s eyes appear to be watering. That looked a very nasty injury. Goodison rises to its feet as the Everton midfielder is carried off. Sky say an ambulance is waiting to take him to hospital. 82 min: Medical staff continue to attend to Andr\u00e9 Gomes. 80 min: Son Heung-min has been sent off. But the Tottenham forward has to be consoled as he heads down the tunnel. Both sets of players appear very distressed at the injury sustained to Andr\u00e9 Gomes. Replays suggest the injury to Andr\u00e9 Gomes was sustained after Son\u2019s challenge, as a result of the way he fell. 78 min: There is real concern for Andr\u00e9 Gomes. Son Heung-min looks absolutely distraught, close to tears. Son\u2019s tackle was not brilliant. 74 min: Giovani Lo Celso replaces Tanguy Ndombele, who had been booked. Tosun replaced Theo Walcott a few minutes ago. The delay for that latest VAR check? More than three minutes. Spiffing ... 73 min: \u201cPerhaps VAR should be restricted to (more) objective decisions,\u201d emails Dave Hannah. \u201cSuch as offside? The disruptive delays that we are all coming to hate appear to be caused by situations that require subjectivity, and often don\u2019t have a clear right answer. The decision is not improved by involving VAR. As ridiculous as an offside armpit sounds, at least it\u2019s an objective decision.\u201d It has been a total killjoy, hasn\u2019t it? 72 min: No penalty. 71 min: A long delay, as the VAR check continues ... 69 min: From the resulting corner, the VAR has flagged up a possible handball. Dele Alli appears to handle the corner, taking the ball away from Yerry Mina. Are Everton about to be awarded a penalty? Anthony Taylor is seeking out all angles. 68 min: Gazzaniga is almost beaten! Tom Davies surges through the Spurs midfield, bypassing a sea of white shirts before spraying the ball wide to Walcott, who is lurking on the right flank, as per. Walcott\u2019s low cross is ordinary but it cannons off Ben Davies, and almost catches Gazzaniga cold. Davinson S\u00e1nchez seemed worried too, but Spurs get away with it. Everton corner ... 66 min: Everton are readying Cenk Tosun. Amid all of the excitement, Tanguy Ndombele went into the book shortly after the goal for a crude challenge on Djibril Sidib\u00e9. Dele Alli strikes! After Alex Iwobi squanders possession, Son slides in Alli, who drives inside Djibril Sidib\u00e9 and fires into the corner beyond Pickford. It was a thumping finish and Alli\u2019s celebration packs a punch, too; he holds an index finger over his mouth before going to ground, pretending to be in a deep sleep. Alli basks in the glory, after Spurs break incisively at Goodison. 60 min: Richarlison stings Gazzaniga\u2019s gloves! Digne raids down the left and cuts the ball back towards the edge of the box. Davinson S\u00e1nchez is sluggish to react and the ball runs into the path of Richarlison, who takes aim first time. His effort is not lacking in power \u2013 but it\u2019s relatively close to the Spurs goalkeeper, who gratefully gathers. S\u00e1nchez has been at the heart of the action in the last few moments. It was the Spurs defender who Richarlison felt tripped him in the box. 59 min: Richarlison goes down in the box \u2013 but there\u2019s nothing doing. Martin Atkinson sprints away, totally uninterested. 58 min: Tottenham\u2019s next opponents are Sheffield United, and both Chris Wilder and Alan Knill are at Goodison to cast their eye over Spurs. Hopefully Wilder has covered his eyes from much of this. It\u2019s been dire from both teams. 55 min: Eriksen sends a gorgeous ball flashing across the six-yard box ... but Tottenham cannot get anyone on the end of it. Everton clear. It was an exemplary cross in \u2013 but Spurs are still to fashion a shot on target. Everton have had just the one. 54 min: Pochettino is nodding along to the fourth official, who is busy explaining the VAR\u2019s decision not to award a penalty. The Spurs manager seems to be taking it pretty well \u2013 but he\u2019s clearly miffed Son did not get the penalty. 51 min: Seconds after the big screens say: VAR decision: no penalty, Martin Atkinson is informed the incident is being reviewed, for a second time. When the VAR check is checked, play can resume. It\u2019s all a bit farcical. Mina certainly made contact with Son. Whether it was a theatrical fall, only he knows. 50 min: Son goes down in the box, collapsing to the floor under pressure ... but Martin Atkinson is unmoved. Yerry Mina\u2019s trailing leg does appear to make contact with the Spurs winger. The video assistant referee will have a look ... 49 min: Lucas Moura is adamant he has earned Spurs a corner but, in fact, Holgate helps Everton win a goal-kick. We go again. 47 min: Stephen Carr emails back in to confirm, sadly, he is not the Stephen Carr. \u201cI am happy to confirm that I am not football\u2019s Stephen Carr and also that I have been to Peterborough on a number of occasions,\u201d he says. As you can tell, not a lot going on in the second half at Goodison. Other than Everton almost pressing Spurs into trouble, with Serge Aurier getting out of a tight corner. 46 min: Spurs\u2019 Dele Alli gets the second half going. \u201cThis match isn\u2019t just like watching paint dry,\u201d emails Stephen Carr (unconfirmed whether it\u2019s the former Tottenham and Newcastle defender). \u201cIt\u2019s like watching beige paint dry. In an abandoned bus stop. In Peterborough.\u201d Anyway, do dust yourselves off for what will surely be a pulsating second half ... Meanwhile, in Italy ... It\u2019s not been a classic. Richarlison looks the most likely to do any damage, with the Everton forward having a couple of efforts repelled. Spurs have not had anything to shout about either. 45 min: There will be two added minutes. Neither Gareth Southgate, up in the posh seats, or indeed anyone else look too excited. It has been a largely dull first half. 43 min: Richarlison works an opening \u2013 but his shot zooms over! He does really well, in fairness. Iwobi plays a simple pass into his path and Richarlison wriggles away from Sanchez, spinning into a yard of space before getting a shot off. Plenty of endeavour from Everton, but not an awful lot to show for it. 42 min: Son Heung-min has not had a sniff. He\u2019s had 10 forgettable touches, fewer than anyone else on the pitch, including both goalkeepers. 41 min: Another Everton corner, another Lucas Moura clearance. 39 min: Andr\u00e9 Gomes is winded as a result of that collision but the Everton midfielder is quickly back on to the field. 38 min: Richarlison feeds Iwobi, nudging the ball into the winger\u2019s path way out from goal. Iwobi charges down the left before teeing a cross into the box but Spurs deal with it. It was a fairly aimless pass in the end. Andr\u00e9 Gomes was cutely blocked off by Sanchez, but Everton have no chance of a penalty. 35 min: Lucas Moura lashes the ball away and Eriksen buys Spurs 50-odd yards of territory, and now Everton find themselves on the back foot. A replay shows Yerry Mina needlessly pulled back Dele Alli as Spurs broke forward on the counter. Martin Atkinson is alerted to it and has a curt word with the defender. 34 min: Everton earn a corner ... 32 min: Richarlison sends a shot at Gazzaniga! The Everton forward does the hard part, controlling Lucas Digne\u2019s dinked cross from the left with his first touch before swivelling and getting a shot away. The ease with which Richarlison manhandled the ball was reminiscent of Joshua King against Manchester United on Saturday. But, the Brazilian\u2019s effort lacks conviction and the Spurs goalkeeper comfortably gathers. 31 min: Eriksen is booked. Lu\u00eds Boa Morte is going ballistic down on the touchline. Silva\u2019s staying calm on this one. Those tackles have revved up Goodison. 30 min: Walcott goes into Martin Atkinson\u2019s book for a late challenge on Ben Davies. Walcott is quick to embrace the Spurs full-back, who is all smiles. It turns out the VAR had a peek at whether Walcott\u2019s challenge was deserving of upgrading to a red card but that\u2019s not the case. 28 min: Nice move from Everton! Sidib\u00e9 slips in Walcott, who races to the byline before standing up an inviting cross. Lurking towards the back post is Andr\u00e9 Gomes, who is not renowned for his aerial ability. The Everton midfielder gets his header all wrong, shunting the ball well over Gazzaniga\u2019s goal. 27 min: Alderweireld nods a straight-off-the-training-ground free-kick wide of goal. It was well-worked by Spurs, who played it short but Everton made life difficult for Alderweireld, who needed a miracle to generate the required power to trouble Pickford. Down on the touchline, Silva is barking like mad. 25 min: Andr\u00e9 Gomes slides through Richarlison but the forward ends up taking the shot on early, rather than allowing the ball to run through in front of him. Richarlison ended up taking the sting out of the pass and giving Sanchez and Alderweireld the initiative to bite back at the Brazilian. 22 min: Spurs get sloppy and then so do Everton, with Digne undercooking a pass inside for Iwobi. Spurs gobble up possession and probe down the left. Ben Davies ends up buying a corner out of Walcott. That was all a bit cheap \u2013 and almost costly. The corner comes to nothing but, when Aurier recycles the ball, his cross from the right lures Pickford into a wild punch. Everton survive. 20 min: Sidib\u00e9 drops the ball before taking a throw-in. It\u2019s not quite happening for either team at the moment at a fairly subdued Goodison. 18 min: The Spurs buildup is all a little too pedestrian and predictable but, eventually, they work the ball wide to Serge Aurier, who whacks the ball in from the right. It\u2019s straight down Jordan Pickford\u2019s throat. 15 min: Walcott gallops into a gaping hole inside the Spurs box but the Everton winger\u2019s cross is not good enough. He fizzes a pass into no man\u2019s land and Spurs hoover up the danger. Everton have been bright without testing Gazzaniga. 12 min: Goodison rises to its feet to commemorate the life of James Myers, a 12-year-old who died on a railway line in Merseyside last month. On the pitch, both teams seem a little cagey; it is almost as if a lot is riding on this one. 11 min: Spurs almost carve an opening. After some patient buildup play, Toby Alderweireld floats a cross-field ball into Davies, who slides in Eriksen. But Everton eventually manage to crowd Tottenham out. It was a slick move, a sign of how Spurs can open up teams. That\u2019s as good as it\u2019s got for Spurs so far. 9 min: Pickford launches the ball high to Walcott out on the right flank. He tries and fails to keep it in, with Davies in close proximity. 8 min: Everton are hogging the ball. Spurs cannot get hold of it. 5 min: Walcott\u2019s pace causes more problems down the Spurs left but the winger\u2019s decision-making lets him down. Again. He ends up running into trouble and Spurs clear their lines. Still, an encouraging start for Everton to build on. 4 min: Pickford wellies the ball downfield in search of Theo Walcott, who had comfortably eluded Davies, but Gazzaniga is alert to alert. It was a wonderful, mammoth Ederson-like kick down the pitch by Pickford. A beautiful kind of route one. 3 min: Spurs think they are in, but the assistant referee adjudged Ben Davies, who is wearing the captain\u2019s armband, offside. The defender had been slipped in down the left flank. His low cross almost picked out Lucas Moura. But it counts for nothing. 1 min: Everton make a decent start. Richarlison plays a beautiful blind pass into Djibril Sidib\u00e9, who scurries forward. They knock the ball around, keeping hold of possession before trying to pick out Iwobi, but the cross evades him. Everton get things started at Goodison. We\u2019ve had an impeccable minute\u2019s silence. Here we go ... Marco Silva speaks, and talks about Yerry Mina replacing Michael Keane, who has endured a torrid time. \u201cWhen you have good competition, it\u2019s always a tough decision,\u201d he says. \u201cWe needed to establish a strategy and [consider] the strengths of the opponents as well, and that helps decide our best eleven. You have to plan.\u201d Mauricio Pochettino talks, and confirms Harry Kane is cocooned in a blanket on the sofa with a virus. \u201cHim and his family got a virus, he started to feel bad on Friday night and it was impossible for him to train on Saturday or to travel with the team,\u201d Pochettino says. \u201cI hope he will feel better and be ready as soon as possible. It is always difficult with injured players like him or Hugo and of course we are trying to cope with this situation. We have a very good squad and different players can step up.\u201d Tim Cahill has just proclaimed Leicester \u201cthe real deal\u201d. Brendan Rodgers\u2019s side could have ended up with three or four in the end: Leicester really are quite brilliant. Ben Chilwell, Youri Tielemans, Jamie Vardy and James Maddison, in front of the watching England assistant Steve Holland, have all been superb. Again. Beyond Manchester City and Liverpool, Brendan Rodgers\u2019s side set the benchmark. Work to do for Everton and Spurs ... Leicester are about to return third in the table. They are two goals to the good against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park: We need to be moving up the table. It has been difficult in the past few weeks but the coach can\u2019t take all the blame. It is us that go out on to the pitch and we need to take responsibility. We are all under the same pressure and unfortunately the results aren\u2019t happening. We were very frustrated last week.\u201d Team news news: the headline absentee is Harry Kane, with the England captain missing out for Tottenham through illness. Jan Vertonghen is not deemed fit enough to make up the numbers after a hamstring problem, while Ben Davies returns in place of the suspended Danny Rose to skipper Spurs. Ryan Sessegnon, however, is among the Spurs substitutes; he could make his Tottenham debut. As for Everton, Tom Davies is one of three changes for Marco Silva. Theo Walcott is also in from the off. Everton (4-2-3-1): Pickford; Sidib\u00e9, Holgate, Mina, Digne; Andr\u00e9 Gomes, Delph; Walcott, Davies, Iwobi; Richarlison Subs: L\u00f6ssl, Keane, Coleman, Sigurdsson, Tosun, Calvert-Lewin, Kean Tottenham Hotspur (4-2-3-1): Gazzaniga; Aurier, S\u00e1nchez, Alderweireld, Davies; Sissoko, Ndombele; Son, Alli, Eriksen; Moura Subs: Vorm, Foyth, Dier, Sessegnon, Winks, Lo Celso, Parrott Referee: Martin Atkinson This, a meeting between teams 17th and 13th in the Premier League, says it all. Marco Silva has been drinking in The Last Chance Saloon for a while and the consensus is the under-pressure Everton manager is almost out of time. That\u2019s despite two wins from his past three matches, though the latter came against his former club, Watford, in the cup in midweek. Shove Silva\u2019s results under the microscope and the picture is bleak, with Everton hovering above the bottom three having won just three league games this season \u2013 against the division\u2019s three W\u2019s: Watford, Wolves and West Ham. If there is any consolation for Silva it is that each of those victories have come at Goodison Park, where they take on Tottenham determined to arrest their slump. \u201cWe need to change it as you can\u2019t have two faces \u2013 one when you play at home and one completely different away,\u201d Silva said. Things are not entirely rosy for Mauricio Pochettino either, with the Spurs manager picking up just one win from his past five matches. Spurs, scarred from shellackings by Bayern Munich and then Brighton, have struggled to strike any form of balance or consistency, particularly on the road \u2013 they have yielded a single away win in the league since January \u2013 but Pochettino will hope his team take this opportunity to prove they are out of the woods. \u201cAt the moment we struggle a little bit in our confidence,\u201d said Pochettino, whose side are winless in their past 11 away games. \u201cThe most important is how we are going to finish, it\u2019s not nice to see you in the middle of the table but that is a reality we need to accept. If you don\u2019t accept the reality you are going to struggle. We know very well that we need time, to be strong, be solid and start to win because that is going to be the best thing for us.\u201d Kick-off: 4.30pm (GMT)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
