The term is a bit of a misnomer, for these places don't just offer an escape from tax. They offer secrecy, in various forms, combined with varying degrees of refusal to co-operate with other jurisdictions in exchanging information. The term \"secrecy jurisdiction\" emerged in the US in the late 1990s, and I use them interchangeably. Another common marker for tax havens is very low or zero taxes. They attract money by letting people escape tax, legally or illegally. Secrecy jurisdictions routinely ringfence their own economies from the facilities they offer, to protect themselves from their own offshore tricks. Offshore is fundamentally about being an elsewhere zone of escape \u2013 and offshore services are provided for non-residents. So a tax haven might, say, offer a zero tax rate to non-residents who park their money there, but tax its own residents fully. Another way to spot a secrecy jurisdiction is to look for whether its financial services industry is very large compared with the size of the local economy. The IMF used this tool in 2007 to finger Britain, correctly, as an offshore jurisdiction. But the most important feature of a secrecy jurisdiction \u2013 and it is a defining one \u2013 is that local politics is captured by financial services interests (or sometimes criminals, and sometimes both), and meaningful opposition to the offshore business model has been eliminated. This political capture produces one of the great offshore paradoxes: these zones of ultra-freedom are often highly repressive places, wary of scrutiny and intolerant of criticism."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
