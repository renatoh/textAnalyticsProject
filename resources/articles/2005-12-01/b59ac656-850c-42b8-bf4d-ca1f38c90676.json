Speaking after meetings with the commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, and three other European leaders in Downing Street today, the prime minister said: \"The overall mood is one of people wanting to reach agreement. \"But I would have to say there are still some very tough negotiations ahead because the room for manoeuvre is very limited.\" Defending his decision to give up at least \u00a31bn of Britain's \u00a33bn annual EU budget rebate to help fund EU enlargement, Mr Blair argued that funding economic development in eastern Europe would hugely benefit British trade. \"It is right that Britain pays its fair share, but not more,\" he said. But he warned there would be no deal if EU member states didn't accept a review of farm subsidies in the common agricultural policy (CAP) before 2013, an idea flatly rejected by France among others. \"People must leave open the possibility of change,\" he insisted. My insistence is that we must at least have the prospect of being able to make a change if we wish to do so,\" he said. \"I cannot force such a change now, but I can insist that we leave open the possibility of such a change for the second half of the financial perspective.\" Tony Blair's hectic diplomatic schedule of talks in person and on the phone with a string of EU leaders began yesterday following criticism earlier this week of Britain's initial budget proposal. Britain now plans to outline revised proposals for the EU's 2007-13 budget next week, where it is expected to reduce the 10% suggested cut in future aid for the 10 new mainly eastern European members. Last week Mr Blair conceded that the UK would have to surrender at least \u00a31bn of the \u00a33bn annual EU budget rebate won by Margaret Thatcher in 1984 but would not accept cutting any money connected to the CAP. Leaving Downing Street after meeting Mr Blair today, Mr Barroso said he believed a deal at the EU heads of government summit on December 15 was still possible. \"It will be very difficult but it is possible to get a deal. I know now that there will be further proposals. I hope these proposals will be in the right direction. Hopefully they will be a solution,\" he said. Mr Barroso last week compared Britain's first proposal to \"Robin Hood in reverse\", for taking money away from poorer EU members to give to the wealthy, which he said was unacceptable. \"We want to make reforms in Europe, and reforms cost money,\" he said. \"If we want to have a large, competitive, open Europe, we have to accept that we have to invest in Europe.\" Talking to reporters in Downing Street, the commission president said a deal next week was important to \"avoid some kind of paralysis\". Mr Blair was today seeing the Irish taisoeach, Bertie Ahern, and the prime ministers of Greece and Spain. He also had telephone discussions with the leaders of Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria. Mr Blair has insisted that the UK will not surrender any part of its rebate linked to the common agricultural policy without its fundamental reform, nor any part in relation to the 15 member states. Britain has offered concessions relating to the 10 new accession countries. After an hour-long meeting with Mr Blair this morning Mr Ahern told reporters that he wanted to be \"constructive\" but had concerns about Britain's demand for CAP reform. \"It's a difficult set of negotiations, but the overall picture is, we should try to complete this next week.\" With farm subsidies a political \"issue of concern\" for Mr Ahern, Ireland has joined France in rejecting any reform of the 2003 CAP deal, which lasts until 2013. \"There's no problem about a review of the CAP, but it is about the date,\" Mr Ahern said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
