President Vladimir Voronin said his party would address the issue of its name after the parliamentary election that it is expected to win. A parliamentary majority of 61 of the 101 seats is needed for MPs to appoint the president. President George Bush said the vote in Moldova, the poorest country in Europe, was a chance to put its \"democratic credentials beyond doubt\". However, the opposition has expressed fears of electoral fraud, and the US State Department and international observers have criticised laws limiting campaign coverage and ensuring the government dominates television coverage. Mr Voronin's party has been communist in name and symbolism alone. It now pursues policies aimed at European Union integration and improving the economy in a country where a quarter of the workforce is employed abroad. The party retains the logo of the hammer and sickle, as its elderly and rural support base remains nostalgic for the security of the Soviet era. However, the Soviet icon now appears upturned in party campaign posters that stress the push for European integration - appearing like an \u20ac in the word \"Vote\". Mr Voronin said the change of identity \"depends on the party's assembly\" and was a \"big task that I cannot decide on my own\". Such a move would complete a big reversal from his poll pledge in 2001 to build greater political and economic ties with Moscow. Relations with Moscow have collapsed since November 2003 when Mr Voronin pulled out of a Russian plan to settle a 13-year conflict over the breakaway region of Transdniestria, where 1,500 Russian troops are stationed, some as peacekeepers. They are the remnant of a force that stopped the conflict in 1992 sparked by Moldova's decision to secede from the Soviet Union. Yesterday, Russia's parliament again called for sanctions against Moldova if it continued to blockade Transdnestria. Mr Voronin dismissed the tension as pre-electoral posturing. He predicted \"all will be calm again\" after the vote. The Russian troops are accused of bolstering the breakaway region - a \"rogue regime\", according to one senior diplomat - accused by some of smuggling drugs, people, counterfeit goods and arms. Tensions have risen in the past year in villages along Transdniestria's border, separating Moldova from Ukraine. Mr Voronin further distanced himself this week from Russia when he met the presidents of Georgia and Ukraine, two other former Soviet republics that have thrown off the yoke of Russian influence Referring to Russia's \"military occupation\", he said in a joint statement with President Mikhail Saakashvili of Georgia: \"Let us all join together and help complete the third wave of European liberation.\" Yet for many Moldovans a new image will not wipe away the communist past. \"They are a mafia party,\" said Volodya Kapatsina, 52, a taxi driver, who plans to vote for Yuri Roshka, head of the Christian Democratic People's party. The opposition fears that the governing party will fix the vote. Serafim Urechean, the mayor of Chisinau and head of the main opposition coalition, the Moldovan Democratic bloc, said: \"From day one, the communists have been busy with falsifying the results. \"Police have attended opposition meetings. People have been arrested and threatened. There is great discontent in the electorate. We want a peaceful process, but if human rights are broken, people have a right to protest.\" Mr Roshka's party has also promised protests on Monday. However, Mr Saakashvili, who led Georgia to a peaceful ousting of its old Soviet elite in 2003, was upbeat about the poll. He told the Guardian: \"The government would not risk stealing the election. People react to injustices everywhere in the same way.\" He thought that Mr Voronin knew his country's survival \"depends on democracy\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
