He wants them to think of ones they could scrap and get on with enforcing the useful ones already on the statute book. But yesterday the former Irish finance minister, frustrated by the cost and time it takes to make cross-border payments, came up with an \"action plan\" to create a single, pan-EU system in all 25 member states by 2010 at the latest. Yes, it will be backed by new laws. The present fragmented national systems, used by firms and private citizens, costs up to 3% of GDP each year to handle 56 billion non-cash transactions worth \u20ac52 trillion (\u00a335 trillion). Replacing them with a single EU-25 system could save up to \u20ac100bn (\u00a370bn) a year. Mr McCreevy, already planning legislation to force down the cost of clearing and settlement in EU bourses, is clearly taking aim at the banks - all 8,000 of them. He's promising to enforce stiffer competition, reduce the often exorbitant costs of simply running a private account and, for shops, of accepting plastic. The banks, he says, must get their act together and create the schemes, services, infrastructures and standards to build a single system - given that the technology and political will already exist. His plan is certain to face delaying tactics, or attempts to raise prices, from the institutions most affected. But, from an EU suffering from inertia, it's a laudably bold idea. Trade secrets Jack Keenan, a non-executive director of Marks &amp; Spencer, has just acquired 50,000 M&amp;S shares at 343p. This \u00a3170,000 package is some buy for Mr Keenan, who has been on the M&amp;S board for four years. The 50,000 shares acquired takes his total holding to 53,238. It certainly appears that his stake has changed in nature - from the token holding required as a non-exec to something that may be a little more lucrative. And he is not the first. This month five directors of M&amp;S have jointly acquired 295,000 shares, worth north of \u00a31m. These are not options or share grants. This is directors wading into the market with their own money. Chief executive Stuart Rose has acquired 100,000, new finance director Ian Dyson is in for 20,000 and chairman Paul Myners - who is also chairman of the GMG, publisher of The Guardian - has picked up 25,000. Even Charles Wilson, Mr Rose's departing deputy, has piled in, snapping up another 100,000. So what do these chaps know that we don't? There is a growing feeling that despite the depression engulfing the high street, which has even spread to smart operators like Next, M&amp;S could be doing better than expected and that its new season's fashions - with their Russian, Romantic and Baroque inspirations - might just be on the button. The next trading update is on October 11. Might just be interesting. Mail conundrum Which ever way you choose to count the numbers at Royal Mail, one fact is inescapable. The company needs a lot of cash to fund the modernisation of its sorting offices and to tackle its pension deficit. But how is that to be achieved? That is the problem facing trade and industry minister Alan Johnson, currently considering Royal Mail's future. One solution would be for the government, Royal Mail's only shareholder, to stump up from the public purse, though the scream of rage from the Treasury would be heard across Whitehall. Another would be full-blown privatisation, to screams from Westminster. As the Lib Dems so aptly, if ineptly, demonstrated yesterday as they rejected their leaders' proposals for a partial sell-off, anything to do with the Royal Mail has a tendency to create division. But doing nothing is not an option. Next year the postal market will open to competition and Royal Mail will have to cope with competitors looking to cherry pick its best - its profitable - customers. Royal Mail will have to take on tough new rivals while saddled with public service responsibilities - delivering to every address in the country, for starters - and be subject to a regulated price regime. None of the competitors will be similarly hobbled. Hardly fair, even allowing for Royal Mail's dominant market position. Mr Johnson must decide what he wants Royal Mail to deliver and then set up a structure to match. For example, should the post offices be separated from the delivery service? The mistake would be to organise the business to meet an ideological mindset. We have been down that unhappy route with the separation of tracks and trains on the railways."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
