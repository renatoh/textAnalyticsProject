Those fearing that the French club would travel to Stadio Artemio Franchi and meekly roll over and have their bellies tickled will have drawn heart from the side Claude Puel put out, with Sidney Govou, Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis and Michel Bastos making up, on paper, a threatening three-pronged attack. However in reality, with J\u00e9r\u00e9my Toulalan and Maxime Gonalons missing from midfield, Lyon failed to assert themselves and the front three were demoted to the role of spectators in a first half that Fiorentina dominated. Govou's wild 20-yard effort in injury time may have been cathartic, but it was also the Ligue 1 side's first meaningful effort and at that stage they were already a goal behind. It was in the 28th minute of Liverpool's catastrophic 2-0 defeat here in September that Stevan Jovetic scored his first of two and once again the Florence club took the lead two minutes before the half hour \u2013 Vargas sending Hugo Lloris the wrong way from the penalty spot after Marco Marchionni was clumsily felled by Aly Cissokho on the byline. That goal was no less than the Italians deserved after enjoying a monopoly on endeavour and adventure in the opening period. Mario Santana rattled the post with a well-struck 18-yard volley and Lloris did splendidly to react and turn the rebound around the post. From the resulting corner Alberto Gilardino outjumped Jean-Alain Boumsong and directed his header on to the other post. Any onlookers with Liverpool sympathies could comfort each other at half-time with the assertion that Lyon could not be much less threatening on the resumption and so it proved. The Bosnian midfielder Miralem Pjanic twice demonstrated that there was life in his safely qualified side \u2013 twice worrying S\u00e9basti\u00e9n Frey, Fiorentina's French keeper, from distance. While Lyon were happy to shoot from long range the home side sought the penetrative moment that could seal their fate and Liverpool's. Just before the hour the industrious Gilardino found space to shoot inside the area, but under pressure from Boumsong the Italy international dragged his left-foot shot across goal. Sissokho made some amends for the concession of the penalty when he perfectly-timed a last ditch tackle on Marchionni but as Lyon's brief bout of adventure waned a second Fiorentina goal began to look more and more likely. Lorenzo Silvestri broke down the right and found an unmarked Gilardino but once more the striker fluffed his lines. In a frantic final quarter Lyon \u2013 and Liverpool \u2013 hopes seemed to rest exclusively with Pjanic's right foot and its potency from set pieces and with 10 minutes to go a dipping effort 35-yard effort required a volleyball style punch from Frey. Late on he chose more conventional methods to deny Jean Makoun and Lisandro. And Liverpool."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
