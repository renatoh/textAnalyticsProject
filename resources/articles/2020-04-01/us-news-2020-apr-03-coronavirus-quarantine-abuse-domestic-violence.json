Another reported they had been strangled by their partner, but feared going to the hospital because of the threat of coronavirus. An immunocompromised man from Pennsylvania called in after his emotionally abusive girlfriend began hiding cleaning supplies and hand sanitizer from him. With more than three-quarters of the US population told to stay home to stem the pandemic\u2019s spread, nowhere is safe for victims of intimate partner violence. A self-quarantine puts them in perpetual proximity to their abuser. Leaving exposes them not just to a deadly virus but a world that has largely closed its doors. Activists worldwide have reported an alarming rise in domestic violence cases since the start of coronavirus-related quarantines. In Wuhan in February, while the province was under strict lockdown, one police station, reported a threefold increase in complaints compared with the same period last year. Advocates are concerned that this bleak reality has reached the United States, where experts say one in four women and one in seven men face physical violence by a partner at some point in their lifetimes. The National Domestic Violence Hotline, which typically receives up to 2,000 calls per day, counted 951 callers between 10 and 24 March who mentioned Covid-19 while reporting their abuse. One caller, from New York, reported being awakened from bed because she had a fever and wasn\u2019t feeling well. Her abuser threw her out of the front door and kept their child. Another told the hotline she was being kept home against her will after being threatened by her abuser with a hammer and an unregistered gun. He was using the pandemic as an excuse to stop her from leaving him, she said. \u201cWe are hearing from survivors how Covid-19 is already being used by their abusive partners to further control and abuse, how Covid-19 is already impacting their ability to access support and services like accessing shelter, counseling, different things that they would typically lean on in their communities,\u201d says Crystal Justice, the chief marketing and development officer at NDVH. \u201cWe want people to socially distance themselves as much as possible, but that really has impacts for people,\u201d says Kimberlina Kavern, senior director of the crime victim assistance program at Safe Horizon, a New York-based victim assistance organization. \u201cA domestic violence victim is likely not able to pick up the phone and call somebody for help because their abusive partner is in the home or in the room with them.\u201d Safe Horizon has a chat service on their website for quiet interactions, as well as an escape button which allows survivors to quickly leave their website without it appearing in their browser history. Kavern explains that financial concerns as the economy falters and unemployment numbers spike can also increase incidents of domestic violence. Studies show that as unemployment rises, so do levels of domestic violence. Financial uncertainty might stop women from leaving even outside times of economic crisis. Women hold two-thirds of America\u2019s low-wage jobs, and many have now been cut. \u201cWhat we are concerned about in the community is that calls to our domestic violence hotline are down, calls to our intake are down, and we don\u2019t think that that\u2019s because less people need our help,\u201d says Susan Pearlstein, co-supervisor of the family law unit of Philadelphia Legal Assistance, which provides legal services to low-income residents of Philadelphia. \u201cWe\u2019re really fearful that the people that are in the most danger are unable to reach out.\u201d PLA saw a 54% decline in intake volume in the period following 16 March. With much of the country shut down, advocates are also concerned that victims may assume there\u2019s nowhere to go for help. That\u2019s not the case, says Pearlstein, emphasizing that hotlines are still open, legal aid remains accessible, and Philadelphia courts have set up remote access to file for protection orders against abusers by phone or email. NDVH operates one of the country\u2019s largest databases of resources and service providers and is working to track who is still operational so that women throughout the country can find where to go for help. Shelters, too, remain open, though many are screening for Covid-19 symptoms. If a woman seeking help from Safe Horizon is showing symptoms, she is referred for medical treatment and can self-quarantine at one of the organization\u2019s shelters. Safe Horizon is practicing physical distancing within shelters, ensuring people are six feet apart and running therapeutic and educational programming virtually when possible. The organization continues to provide child advocacy services, as well; with children out of school, Kavern also expects an inevitable increase in child abuse, especially with fewer options to seek refuge in someone else\u2019s home. When leaving isn\u2019t an option, advocates are still committed to helping women navigate a changed world. \u201cObviously a safety plan looks very different if they\u2019re forced to shelter in place with their abuser, so right now, we\u2019re focusing a lot on emotional safety plans,\u201d says Justice. \u201cThen physical safety planning. What does it look like for you to create physical distance between yourself and the abuser in the space that you\u2019re in? What does it look like for you to use virtual tools? What does it look like for you to reach out in a time of emergency?\u201d Advocates at the National Domestic Violence Hotline are available 24/7 at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) in more than 200 languages. Survivors can also chat with advocates here. This article was amended on 3 April 2020 to clarify that women seeking help with Safe Horizon can self-quarantine at the organization\u2019s shelters if they are showing symptoms."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
