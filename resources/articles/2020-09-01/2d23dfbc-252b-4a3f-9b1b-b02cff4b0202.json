Thanks as always for following along with us and be sure to check out the full match report here. \u201cIt was tough in the end,\u201d says Medvedev, who finished with 51 winners against 37 unforced errors. \u201cThat\u2019s why maybe for the first time in almost a year I actually celebrated my win because it was very tough in the end and I felt like I could get in trouble, so I was really happy to get the win. One point decided two sets. Andrey was playing honestly unbelievable.\u201d Asked about the decisive first-set tiebreaker, Medvedev describes the game within the game against his childhood friend. \u201cIt was 6-3, two of my serves,\u201d he says \u201cI was going for the second one because I knew that if I\u2019m going to push the ball right now, he\u2019s going to go for it and 6-4 is not 6-5. So on 6-5, I decided to not go for it and he went just a little bit out. I think it was a really tactical game today and I\u2019m really happy to go through.\u201d Third-set tiebreak: Rublev 5-7 Medvedev Rublev immediately goes down a minibreak as Medvedev cranks a forehand winner early in the rally, but Medvedev gives it right back with a double fault upheld by a challenge. Medvedev then hits a highlight-reel backhand winner down the line from the baseline and we\u2019re on serve. Rublev pounds an ace then wins the next point on a Medvedev unforced error. On serve with Medvedev serving at 2-3 and he strikes a 126mph unreturnable serve out wide for 3-all as the players change ends. Medvedev holds again as Rublev chips in his 17th unforced error. And then Medvedev comes in for the kill, pouncing ruthlessly on a 74mph second second and ripping a backhand winner up the line. Wow! Medvedev is two points from the finish line with Rublev serving at 3-5. Rublev wins the point, then gets the minibreak back when Medvedev blinks on his serve. Serving at 5-5, Medvedev cracks a forehand winner for match point ... and he converts it after running Rublev ragged then hitting a forehand into the open court! Medvedev is back into the US Open semi-finals after dispensing of Andrey Rublev in two hours and 27 minutes! Third set: Rublev 6-7, 3-6, 6-6 Medvedev Another love hold for Medvedev, who\u2019s won 11 straight points on his serve. We\u2019re heading to a third-set tiebreaker. Third set: Rublev 6-7, 3-6, 6-5 Medvedev* ... and Rublev holds at love, capping it with his ninth ace. Medvedev will again serve to stay in the third after the break. Third set: *Rublev 6-7, 3-6, 5-5 Medvedev Medvedev holds at love, capping it with his 15th ace ... Third set: Rublev 6-7, 3-6, 5-4 Medvedev* Rublev comes through with another stress-free hold, slotting his eighth ace of the day along the way. Medvedev, who appears to have caught a cramp near the end of the game, will serve to stay in the third set after the change of ends. Indeed, Medvedev has called the trainer, who is working away on his right shoulder and both quads during a medical timeout. Third set: *Rublev 6-7, 3-6, 4-4 Medvedev Medvedev pounds a forehand winner to open the game, but follows with his second double fault and an unforced error off the backhand to go down 15-30 on his serve for only the second time today. A glimmer of a chance for Rublev here. But Medvedev rattles off three quick points including a pair of unreturnable serves to escape with the hold. Third set: Rublev 6-7, 3-6, 4-3 Medvedev* Rublev holds easily from love-15 down. He\u2019s won 82% of his first-serve points in the third set, up from 67% in the second. Third set: *Rublev 6-7, 3-6, 3-3 Medvedev Daniil Medvedev: four points, four aces. Next? Third set: Rublev 6-7, 3-6, 3-2 Medvedev* Rublev holds easily from 15-all, going forehand passing winner, 119mph ace down the middle, 110mph ace out wide. On we go. Third set: *Rublev 6-7, 3-6, 2-2 Medvedev Rublev pushes Medvedev to love-15, then 15-30 for the first time all day thanks to Medvedev\u2019s first double fault. But Medvedev cruises to the hold from there, closing it with consecutive backhand winners from the baseline. Third set: Rublev 6-7, 3-6, 2-1 Medvedev* Rublev holds comfortably. A bit more positivity on his side after the dismal body language that carried over from the tiebreaker into the second set. Third set: *Rublev 6-7, 3-6, 1-1 Medvedev Medvedev responds with a business-like hold at love. The highlight: a superb backhand passing winner for 40-love that paints the sideline. Third set: Rublev 6-7, 3-6, 1-0 Medvedev* Rublev holds to open the third. But if we\u2019re being real, this one has felt all but a handshake away since the first-set tiebreaker. Second set: Rublev 6-7, 3-6 Medvedev Medvedev opens with a 129mph ace down the middle before misfiring off the backhand side for 15-all. But he follows with back-to-back winners from the baseline for two set points. And he needs only one of them, firing in a 107mph second serve that Rublev can\u2019t return into play. Medvedev takes a commanding two-sets-to-none lead and is one set from the semi-finals. Second set: Rublev 6-7, 3-5 Medvedev* Rublev quickly holds at love, putting the pressure on Medvedev to serve out the set. Second set: *Rublev 6-7, 2-5 Medvedev Medvedev, working quickly on his serve now, clinically backs up the break, closing out the easy hold with a 130mph ace down the middle. Curiously, Rublev is given a code violation for audible obscenity even though his eruption after going down 40-15 was more of a barbaric yawp than discernible swear word. Medvedev breaks in sixth game of second set! Second set: Rublev 6-7, 2-4 Medvedev* A dangerous moment for Rublev, who very quickly goes down love-15 then 15-40 on his serve. It\u2019s the first break point of the match for either player and Medvedev makes the most of it, crushing an overhand winner at the end of a 12-shot rally to take control of the set. Second set: *Rublev 6-7, 2-3 Medvedev Medvedev breezes through a love hold. He\u2019s 12 of 13 points on his racket this set \u2013 and 22 of the last 26 on his serve going back to the first. Second set: Rublev 6-7, 2-2 Medvedev* Rublev seems to have settled, cracking his third and fourth aces of the afternoon en route to a simple hold of serve. Good sign. Second set: *Rublev 6-7, 1-2 Medvedev Medvedev rolls through another service game, capping the love hold with a 123mph ace out wide. Some changeover reading: Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report off Serena Williams\u2019s quarter-final win earlier today. Second set: Rublev 6-7, 1-1 Medvedev* Rublev goes down 15-30 on his serve. Early days, but feels like a critical juncture given the context. He responds with a forehand winner followed by a service winner, but Medvedev pushes it to deuce after winning a baseline rally. From there Rublev escapes with the badly needed hold, putting a bit of distance between him and that catastrophic breaker. Second set: *Rublev 6-7, 0-1 Medvedev Medvedev does exactly what\u2019s needed: whizzing through his opening service game in a blur to immediately put the pressure back on Rublev, who is still fuming after letting the opener slip through his fingers. First-set tiebreak: Rublev 6-7 Medvedev Rublev wins the first point of the breaker on his serve when Medvedev misfires on a drop shot at the end of an 22-shot baseline rally. Another lengthy rally \u2013 what ball-striking! \u2013 and Rublev wins the point as Medvedev goes down an early minibreak. Both men hold their serves over the next three points until Rublev paints the line on Medvedev\u2019s serve with an inside-out forehand winner. With Rublev serving at 5-2 and two points from the set, he mixes in his first double fault of the match. But Rublev wins the next point to give him three set points. Medvedev saves the first then the second, both on his serve, giving Rublev a set point on his racket at the match hits the hour mark. And Rublev makes an unforced error on a forehand at the end of a 16-shot rally. We\u2019re at 6-all but the momentum is very much in Medvedev\u2019s favor. Medvedev then wins another point on Rublev\u2019s serve and he will have a set point ... and Medvedev closes it out with a 128mph ace down the middle. Rublev lays waste to his racket after squandering leads of 5-1 and 6-3 in the tiebreaker. A meltdown, no two ways about it. First set: Rublev 6-6 Medvedev We\u2019ve got a delay on court as the electronic scoreboards on court have been flickering. The players want to wait until they\u2019re turned off completely. More than four minutes have passed since the last ball hit in anger. The chair umpire says they\u2019ve been shut off, but they begin to flicker once more right as Medvedev hits a first serve out. They\u2019ve stopped again as the tournament referee gets involved and Rublev has darted off the court for a bathroom break after he\u2019s ensured it won\u2019t count against his quota. We\u2019re finally under way with the scoreboard powered down ... and Medvedev holds at love to force a tiebreaker. First set: Rublev 6-5* Medvedev Rublev is facing a spot of pressure on serve for the first time today. He\u2019s pushed to deuce from 40-love after misfiring on a backhand at the end of a 22-shot rally, but he rattles off two quick points from theree to escape with the hold. Medvedev will serve to force a first-set tiebreaker after the changeover. First set: *Rublev 5-5 Medvedev Medvedev is forced into a backhand error on the opening point to go love-15 down, marking the first time either player has fallen behind on his serve so far. But he responds emphatically on the next three points: forehand baseline winner, 125mph ace down the middle, forehand baseline winner. He then closes out the hold with a 124mph serve out wide that Rublev can\u2019t get back into play. First set: Rublev 5-4 Medvedev* Rublev responds with a love hold of his own. He\u2019s only gettiing about a third of his first serves in \u2013 nine of 26 so far \u2013 but staying afloat with 13-of-17 second-serve points won (76%). First set: *Rublev 4-4 Medvedev Medvedev holds at love, crushing a 129mph ace down the middle along the way. His first-serve percentage inches above 50% during his cleanest service game yet. That\u2019s a good sign: He\u2019s won 10 of 11 of his first-serve points, a formidable 91% clip. First set: Rublev 4-3 Medvedev* Rublev opens with a 128mph ace down the middle, but Medvedev crushes a forehand winner from the baseline on the next point for 15-all. Rublev rattles three straight points from there, sealing the hold with a forehand winner early in the point. Both guys hitting the cover off the ball early. First set: *Rublev 3-3 Medvedev Medvedev breezes through another service game, closing it out with a 121mph ace out wide. On we go. First set: Rublev 3-2 Medvedev* After Rublev wins the opening point with a sharp backhand, Medvedev gets the better of a grueling 18-shot exchange with a backhand winner for 15-all. From there, Rublev rattles off three quick points for the hold. Both sides looking comfortable on serve in the early going. First set: *Rublev 2-2 Medvedev Medvedev answers with a stress-free hold of his own, capping it with a 127mph ace down the middle. Mostly short points so far but some big hitting and fine shotmaking when they get into the rallies. First set: Rublev 2-1 Medvedev* Another uncomplicated hold for Rublev, who cracks a 105mph ace out wide along the way. First set: *Rublev 1-1 Medvedev Medvedev opens with a 110mph second-serve service winner to the body and cruises to a straightforward hold in his opening service game. First set: Rublev 1-0 Medvedev* The second match of the day is under way on Ashe. And if the 35-stroke rally (!) won by Rublev to hold his opening service game is any indication, this all-Russian matchup between old friends could be a barnburner. The final for the women\u2019s doubles has been set. The No3 seeds, Nicole Melichar and Xu Yifan, have won their semi-final and will face the team of Laura Siegemund and Vera Zvonareva in the final. \u201cIt just shows me how tough moms are,\u201d Williams says in her on-court interview after winning the first ever major quarter-final staged between two mothers. \u201cWhenever you can birth a baby, then honestly you can do anything. And I think we saw that with Tsvetana today. She played unbelievable.\u201d She adds: \u201cI could barely win a match when I came back. She\u2019s incredible. That\u2019s why I say I think I\u2019m most influenced by moms. ... You play a match and you go home and you\u2019re still changing diapers. It\u2019s like a double life. It\u2019s really surreal.\u201d Asked about her slow start in falling a set and break down, Williams admitted to experiencing fatigure in the early going. \u201cI definitely was feeling it a little in my legs,\u201d she says. \u201cFor whatever reason, an hour in I get more energy. I guess that\u2019s a good thing. I don\u2019t really get tired. Just in the beginning I was a little fatigued for whatever reason. Obviously I can\u2019t do that if I want to keep winning, so I\u2019m going to try to figure that out. \u201cI play again tomorrow. The good news is I\u2019m used to playing back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back, so in a way I\u2019ll kind of be used to it. But at the same time I just need to figure out how to start out a little bit faster.\u201d Third set: Pironkova 6-4, 3-6, 2-6 Williams Williams closes it out in style: 103mph ace out wide, 107mph service winner down the middle, 124mph unreturnable, backhand winner at the net. The 23-time major champion is through the US Open semi-finals ... and two wins away from her record-tying 24th! Williams breaks in seventh game of third set! Third set: Pironkova 6-4, 3-6, 2-5 Williams* Williams giving Pironkova no quarter. The Buglarian is a point from the hold at 40-15, but Williams rattles off three quick points for a break chance. Pironkova saves it with a backhand winner, but moments later Williams earns a second look at a break ... and this time converts it with a backhand winner of her own. The American will serve for the spot in the semi-finals after the change of ends. Third set: *Pironkova 6-4, 3-6, 2-4 Williams Another easy service game for Williams, who punctuates the hold with a 122mph ace down the middle. Pironkova running out of time to make up the difference. Third set: Pironkova 6-4, 3-6, 2-3 Williams* Pironkova comes through with her first drama-free hold since the first set, opening with her fourth ace and going backhand winner, service winner, service winner to close it out. Third set: *Pironkova 6-4, 3-6, 1-3 Williams A dialed-in Williams breezes to a comfortable hold, capping it with a 120mph ace down the pipe. Another must-hold game coming up for Pironkova, who still trails by a break. Third set: Pironkova 6-4, 3-6, 1-2 Williams* After cruising on her serve early, Pironkiva has found herself fighting from behind in her last six service games. She is pushed to deuce from love-15 and 15-30 before escaping with the hold in another drawn-out marathon. She\u2019s hit 21 winners against 22 unforced errors on the day (compared to 34 and 24 for Williams, respectively). Third set: *Pironkova 6-4, 3-6, 0-2 Williams Williams is pushed to deuce, but follows with a pair of unreturnable serves to close out the hold and back up the break. That\u2019s five games on the trot for the American from 3-all in the second. A must-hold service game forthcoming for Pironkova. Williams breaks in first game of third set! Third set: Pironkova 6-4, 3-6, 0-1 Williams* Pironkova almost immediately in deep waters after falling behind love-30 on her serve. She rallies with three quick points, but Williams responds with a backhand winner off the ground for deuce followed by a backhand return winner for break point. Pironkova erases it with the aid of the netcord, but faces another break point only moments later. Pironkova saves that one, too, when Williams overcooks a backhand return on a 73mph second serve. Williams hangs around long enough for a third break chance and this time she capitalizes, winning the 16-point marathon to nose ahead in the decider. Second set: Pironkova 6-4, 3-6 Williams Williams goes down love-15, then 15-30. But the American digs in, pounding her 14th, 15th and 16th aces to back up the break and close out the set in style. We\u2019re headed to a decider. Williams breaks in eighth game of second set! Second set: Pironkova 6-4, 3-5 Williams* Pironkova drops three quick points on her serve to give Williams three chances at a break point. She saves the first with a forehand volley winner. Then a gruelling 24-stroke baseline rally breaks out \u2013 the longest of the afternoon \u2013 ending when Pironkova mishits a drop shot. Williams gets the break and will serve to force a deciding set! Second set: *Pironkova 6-4, 3-4 Williams Williams goes down love-15 and 15-30, but serves her way out of trouble once more as Pironkova doesn\u2019t get a ball back in play the rest of the way. Second set: Pironkova 6-4, 3-3 Williams* Pironkova badly needed a straightforward service game and that\u2019s what she produced, rattling off four quick points after misfiring a forehand volley for love-15. They\u2019re on serve in the second. Second set: *Pironkova 6-4, 2-3 Williams Williams breezes through her third service game of the set, closing out the love hold with a 99mph ace out wide and an 88mph second-serve service winner. Second set: Pironkova 6-4, 2-2 Williams* Pironkova feels the pressure on her serve for a second straight service game, getting pushed to deuce and saving a break point before escaping with the hold. Williams is getting neutral in the baseline rallies far more effectively than in the first set, when Pironkova won all five exchanges of nine or more shots. Second set: *Pironkova 6-4, 1-2 Williams Williams is forced to deuce and made to work for the hold over a 12-point game, but the American is helped out mightily once again by her serve: she\u2019s just slotted her ninth, 10th and 11th aces of the day. She\u2019s also starting to get the ball deeper into the court in the rallies, denying Pironkova the time and space that she enjoyed in the first set. Williams breaks in second game of second set! Second set: Pironkova 6-4, 1-1 Williams* Pironkova blinks in her first service game of the second set, falling behind love-15, then 15-30, then 30-40 to give Williams her first look at a break point all day. And Williams converts it when Pironkova misfires on a forehand from the baseline, breaking right back. Pironkova breaks in first game of second set! Second set: *Pironkova 6-4, 1-0 Williams Williams crushes her eighth ace for 15-all after dropping the opening point, then is pushed to 30-all after Pironkova gets the better of a backhand-to-backhand exchange from the baseline. Pironkova then hits a backhand winner for break point ... and the underdog converts it when Williams misfires a forehand for her 13th unforced error of the day. The upset alert is on as Williams goes down a set and a break. First set: Pironkova 6-4 Williams Serving at 15-love and three points from the set, Pironkova picks a poor time for her first double fault of the day. But she responds nicely, going 110mph ace, service winner and backhand winner to close out the set. Williams will need to go the distance if she hopes to keep her quest for a record-tying 24th major title alive. First set: *Pironkova 5-4 Williams Unforced errors are beginning to creep into Williams\u2019 game at an inopportune time. She is pushed to 30-all after making a pair of them off the backhand side. Pironkova wins the next point with a sharp backhand from the baseline for set point, but Williams saves it with a forehand winner into an open court. She follows with a service winner but another unforced error from the baseline on the next point edges it back to deuce. Pironkova then slots a highlight-reel lob winner for a second set point, but wastes it with an overcooked forehand. From there Williams holds, closing it out with a 103mph ace down the middle. Pironkova will serve for the first set after the changeover. First set: Pironkova 5-3 Williams* Pironkova falls behind love-15 and is pushed to a second serve at 30-all, but she holds comfortably from there, capping the hold with a 109mph ace out wide. Williams will now serve to stay in the first set. First set: *Pironkova 4-3 Williams Williams holds at love, closing out the hold with her eighth winner (against five unforced errors). The American\u2019s serve is keeping her afloat so far with 10 of 13 first-serve points won (77%), but she will need to improve her first-serve percentage (54%), especially if Pironkova manages to sustain this level. First set: Pironkova 4-2 Williams* Pironkova races through another service game. She\u2019s lost only two of the 14 points on her serve. Williams is looking to avoid backhand-to-backhand exchanges by playing heavily to her opponent\u2019s forehand, but Pironvoka\u2019s movement and point construction have mostly thwarted the tactic so far. Pironkova breaks in fifth game of first set! First set: *Pironkova 3-2 Williams Pironkova gets her teeth into a Williams service game, ripping a forehand winner from the baseline for 30-all. Then Williams mixes in her first double fault to give Pironkova her first break-point opportunity of the day. The American saves it with a 104mph ace down the middle, but an unforced error off the backhand on the next point gives Pironkova a second look at a break. This time she converts, pounding a backhand winner down the line from a step inside the baseline to nab the early break. First set: Pironkova 2-2 Williams* A promising start for Pironkova, who holds at love. Williams, who didn\u2019t get a single ball back into play in the game, is having trouble reading the serve of the Bulgarian, who\u2019s won eight of nine points on her racket. First set: Pironkova 1-1 Williams* Pironkova, surprisingly, opens with an ace: 108mph down the center. She follows with a forehand winner from the baseline to settle a 15-shot rally, then a service winner for 40-love. Pironkova gifts Williams one back with a forehand error, but holds on the next point with a forehand passing winner as Williams comes to net. First set: *Pironkova 0-1 Williams (*denotes next server) Williams is on serve to start the match and is quick off the mark, following a service winner with back-to-back aces: 108mph out wide and 115mph down the middle. Pironkova finally gets a ball back in play and on the board with a drop shot/lob combo winner, then pushes it to 40-30 when Williams misfires on a forehand. But Williams responds with her third ace to close out the hold in her opening service game. The players have emerged from the tunnel into Arthur Ashe Stadium for today\u2019s first quarter-final. Williams is unbeaten in four previous meetings with Pironkova including a pair of straight-sets wins in their two hard-court matches. Another straightforward outcome would very much be to the American\u2019s benefit given the quick turnaround before tomorrow\u2019s women\u2019s semi-finals. Hello and welcome to Arthur Ashe Stadium for Wednesday\u2019s daytime twinbill. A pair of quarter-final matches are on the menu with Serena Williams facing Bulgaria\u2019s Tsvetana Pironkova, followed by an all-Russian clash betwen Andrey Rublev and Daniil Medvedev. Today\u2019s opener is a matchup between two of the nine mothers in this year\u2019s draw. The third-seeded Williams, who missed more than a year after having a daughter in 2017, will continue her quest for a record-tying 24th major title against the unseeded Pironkova, who is playing her first tournament after a three-year hiatus where she gave birth to a son. The winner advances to a semi-final matchup on Thursday against either No 16 Elise Mertens or unseeded Victoria Azarenka, who face off at 7pm local time. Bryan will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell on Serena Williams\u2019s campaign: Nobody in tennis suffers for her art like Serena Williams \u2013 except maybe her one-time doubles partner, Andy Murray. On the women\u2019s Tour, nobody retreats into her own world so completely under pressure, external and self-induced, to then emerge like a butterfly from a chrysalis and fly free. For as long as she stays in the fight this week at Flushing Meadows, the greatest player of her generation will become more introspective, irascible, monosyllabic and explosive in pursuit of a 24th grand slam title. If she wins the final point of the tournament to move alongside Margaret Court after nearly three fruitless seasons, she will smile, thank the absent crowd and let go of the anxiety that gripped her so worryingly in the first set of her win over Sloane Stephens on Saturday.
