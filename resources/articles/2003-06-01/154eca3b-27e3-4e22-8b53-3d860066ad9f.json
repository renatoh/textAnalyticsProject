Which is why every year we ask you, the readers of the Guardian, the Observer and our website, Guardian Unlimited Travel, for your personal recommendations. Here we publish the results - the best places in the world to visit and the best people to take you there. A record 24,000 of you answered our questionnaire, published in January, asking you to rate the quality of service you received on your holidays by ticking one of four boxes: excellent, good, fair or poor. We scored the answers from four to nought, respectively, and the total for each company was divided by the number of coupons. This figure was then translated into a percentage, allowing us to compare small companies, assessed on fewer coupons, with larger rivals. You may be surprised by some of the results, but then travel is all about finding new places and new ways of enjoying them. Happy holidays. How to read these results Number in brackets is last year's position. First number is the amount of coupons received. Second number is the percentage score. Best travel agent A couple of new faces make the top 10 this year, but Trailfinders regains the top spot it lost to Travelcare in 2002. 1 Trailfinders (2) 533; 86.4 2 Apollo Travel (-) 71; 81.7 3 Travelcare (1) 587; 81.4 4 American Express (-) 59; 80.3 5 Travelbag (-) 161; 79.8 6 Bridge The World (5) 89; 78.3 7 STA Travel (7) 397; 77.7 8 Flight Centre (-)109; 77.3 9 Air Miles (10) 79; 77.1 10 British Airways (-) 88; 76.4 11 Bakers Dolphin (6)78; 75.7 12 Expedia (-) 123; 74.6 13 Going Places (10) 441; 73.7 14 Thomas Cook (8) 963; 72.2 15 Holiday Hypermarket (-) 80; 71.9 Best online booking service The response from our readers to Opodo's first full year of trading looks to have justified the hype. However, it's a long-established brand, Virgin, that takes the honours, in a category where other operators failed to work as successfully online. 1 Virginholidays.co.uk (-) 66; 84.1 2 Opodo.co.uk (-) 206; 82.0 3 easyJet.com* (2) 968; 80.0 4 Buzzaway.com* (3) 139; 79.7 5 Expedia.co.uk (9) 886; 78.5 6 Dialaflight.com (-) 56; 78.4 7 Travelocity.co.uk (-) 73; 77.3 8 Ebookers.com (7) 414; 75.6 9 Go-fly.com* (5) 139; 74.8 10 Ryanair.com* (6) 298; 74.0 11 Trailfinders.co.uk (-) 56; 73.6 12 Airmiles.co.uk (-) 73; 72.9 13 Mytravel.com (-) 68; 71.7 14 Britishairways.com (8) 153; 71.0 15 Teletextholidays.co.uk (-) 92; 70.9 Best tour operator Close, but no cigar for Tapestry, who for the second year inched tantalisingly close to unseating the winners. But while the top five nearest contenders have all improved on their scores, it's still not enough to beat Laskarina, who wins this blue ribbon category for a remarkable eighth year in a row. 1 Laskarina (1) 158; 95.5 2 Tapestry (2) 120; 94.2 3 VFB Holidays (3) 113; 93.9 4 Citalia (-) 114; 91.9 5 Inntravel (-) 82; 91.4 6 Saga (4) 113; 89.7 7 Trailfinders (6) 235; 88.3 8 Canvas Holidays (-) 79; 88.1 9 Magic Group (18) 68; 86.0 10 Bridge The World (-) 55; 85.5 11 Page &amp; Moy (10) 83; 85.3 12 Headwater (16) 62; 85.3 13 Explorers (-) 54; 83.8 14 Simply Travel (8) 226; 83.7 15 Kuoni (14) 378; 83.3 Best short break company Inntravel, second two years ago, breaks the stranglehold of VFB Holidays - winner every year so far in this category.

British Airways' price cuts seem to have propelled them to the top of this particular league. Meanwhile, the two best scoring no-frills brands, Buzz and Go, no longer exist. 1 British Airways (-) 174; 76.6 2 British Midland (8) 496; 74.1 3 Buzz* (6) 669; 71.2 4 Go* (1) 1519; 70.7 5 easyJet* (2) 3919; 67.2 6 Britannia (-) 78; 65.4 7 Monarch (7) 130; 62.7 8 My Travel Lite (-) 57; 62.6 9 Aer Lingus (-) 59; 62.1 10 Ryanair* (3) 3306; 61.4 11 JMC (4) 102; 61.2 12 Airtours (-) 93; 60.8 13 Air 2000 (5) 137; 58.1 Best leisure airline Once again, it's a tussle between Singapore Airlines and Emirates, with clear blue sky between these two and third place, but Singapore winning for the second year running. Malaysia and Cathay Pacific make it an all-Eastern top four, with Thai and SriLankan also in the top 10. 1 Singapore Airlines (1) 292; 88.5 2 Emirates (2) 281; 86.6 3 Malaysia Airlines (5) 176; 80.7 4 Cathay Pacific (-) 78; 80.4 5 Virgin Atlantic (7) 690; 80.4 6 Air New Zealand (4) 103; 80.1 7 SAS (6) 91; 79.9 8 Swiss (8) 128; 79.7 9 Thai Airways (3) 157; 79.5 10 SriLankan Airlines (-) 50; 77.2 11 Lufthansa (13) 280; 76.4 12 Air Canada (14) 112; 74.8 13 Aer Lingus (-) 111; 74.3 14 British Midland (28) 367; 73.4 15 British Airways (18) 3587; 72.8 Best business airline Virgin takes the top slot for the fourth year running, well ahead of British Airways. Low-cost airlines have fallen from favour in this section; both Ryanair and easyJet have dropped out of the top 10 list, while Go no longer exists. 1 Virgin (1) 244; 82.5 2 Lufthansa (2) 102; 77.6 3 Aer Lingus (-) 62; 75.8 4 British Midland (3) 397; 73.0 5 Air France (-) 52; 72.1 6 British Airways (4) 2222; 71.1 7 KLM (6) 194; 70.6 8 Go* (7) 97; 68.6 9 United Airlines (-) 77; 68.5 10 American Airlines (-) 55; 64.9 11 easyJet* (8) 347; 63.7 12 Ryanair* (5) 127; 57.7 Best train company Congratulations to Eurostar for holding on to first place.

Enterprise Rent-a-Car moves up a place to silver, pushing Autos Abroad back to bronze. 1 Arnold Clark (-) 63; 79.3 2 Enterprise Rent-a-Car (3) 158; 77.6 3 Autos Abroad (2) 86; 74.4 4 Holiday Autos (6) 500; 73.6 5 Dollar (-) 59; 73.4 6 Thrifty (-) 112; 72.8 7 National Car Rental (1) 98; 71.3 8 Alamo Rent a Car (7) 519; 70.5 9 Budget Rent a Car(12) 487; 70.2 10 Europcar (4) 716; 68.7 11 Hertz (11) 1668; 68.7 12 Avis (8) 1008; 68.7 13 EasyCar (5) 633; 68.7 14 Eurocars Rent a Car (10) 171; 68.5 15 Auto Car Rentals (9) 59; 67.4 Best ferry crossing Our readers obviously feel they get a better service on the North Sea than on Channel crossings, voting P&amp;O North Sea Ferries into first place again, with DFDS coming in a close second. Only three years old, Norfolkline has jumped to third place. 1 P&amp;O North Sea Ferries *(1) 123; 80.3 2 DFDS (5) 114; 76.5 3 Norfolkline (-) 73; 74.4 4 Brittany Ferries (2) 1113; 74.2 5 Caledonian Macbrayne (6) 145; 73.3 6 Irish Ferries (3) 205; 71.0 7 Condorferries (-) 58; 69.9 8 Wightlink (7) 74; 69.2 9 SeaFrance (11) 385; 69.1 10 Stena Line (9) 553; 68.9 11 Hoverspeed (8) 252; 67.6 12 Seacat (-) 127; 67.4 13 P&amp;O Stena (10) 1873; 67.0 Best UK hotels The clear winner here is the Hotel du Vin, whose classy rooms and excellent food and wine have proved an irresistible combination.

Former number one Hyatt has slipped to 10th place. 1 Shangri-La (-) 64; 97.4 2 Paradors of Spain (-) 89; 94.7 3 Four Seasons (-) 73; 94.6 4 Luxor, Las Vegas (-) 55; 89.2 5 Melia (-) 51; 87.9 6 Sofitel (-) 91; 87.3 7 Le Meridien (-) 123; 87.3 8 Inter-Continental (5) 78; 85.9 9 Westin Hotels (-) 59; 85.4 10 Hyatt (1) 144; 85.3 11 ANA (-) 207; 83.3 12 Sheraton (6) 246; 83.0 13 Sol (-) 105; 82.3 14 Hilton (4) 429; 82.3 15 Disney (-) 125; 81.7 Favourite UK city Cities north of the border head the tables in this section, with Edinburgh winning for the fourth consecutive year and Glasgow moving up to second place. 1 Edinburgh (1) 1928; 85.5 2 Glasgow (5) 861; 84.4 3 Newcastle upon Tyne (3) 471; 83.6 4 Belfast (9) 157; 81.5 5 Winchester (-) 74; 80.1 6 York (6) 944; 80.1 7 Bath (7) 947; 79.3 8 Brighton (11) 685; 78.5 9 Durham (2) 120; 78.2 10 Cardiff (12) 401; 77.9 11 Norwich (16) 189; 77.3 12 Manchester (19) 1033; 76.9 13 Chester (8) 217; 76.2 14 Salisbury (-) 55; 76.1 15 Hull (-) 51; 76.1 Favourite overseas city Once again, Australian cities Sydney and Melbourne lead the field, with the World Cup effect moving formerly unranked Tokyo up into third place. Oslo is the most popular European city on the list. 1 Sydney (1) 403; 96.6 2 Melbourne (2) 100; 95.1 3 Tokyo (-) 80; 94.6 4 Cape Town (3) 205; 94.5 5 Vancouver (5) 129; 94.4 6 Rio De Janeiro (-) 51; 93.4 7 Chicago (18) 83; 93.2 8 Dubai (-) 93; 92.5 9 Oslo (-) 53; 92.5 10 Orlando (40) 129; 92.3 11 New York (9) 689; 92.1 12 Perth (-) 50; 91.4 13 Venice (7) 658; 91.2 14 Hong Kong (13) 107; 91.2 15 Berlin (12) 220; 90.9 Favourite European country The Nordic countries have performed well again this year, taking three of the top four slots.

Peace talks in Sri Lanka have helped the island move up to 10th place. 1 Chile (-) 58; 89.7 2 Morocco (29) 98; 89.2 3 Tanzania (7) 74; 89.1 4 Ecuador (11) 55; 87.5 5 Brazil (21) 133; 87.2 6 United Arab Emirates (27) 79; 86.4 7 Costa Rica (3) 63; 86.1 8 Canada (13) 522; 85.8 9 Argentina (31) 83; 85.3 10 Sri Lanka (19) 191; 84.9 11 Kenya (30) 149; 84.9 12 Australia (4) 1447; 84.6 13 Thailand (17) 478; 84.6 14 Nepal (2) 80; 84.5 15 Cuba (14) 304; 84.5 Best brochure of the year Winner: Original Travel We received more than 300 entries in the best brochure of the year category, covering the whole spectrum of holidays from coach tours to luxury safaris. But one brochure stood out for its innovative design and clear understanding of its target market. Original Travel is a new tour operator specialising in short, adventurous breaks for professional people who want to make the most of their precious holiday time. The company has ditched the traditional glossy, A4 brochure format to produce a classy book of holidays with a plain grey cover that really stands out from the competition. The judges felt that the brochure struck the perfect balance between style and substance and did not sacrifice user-friendliness or clarity in its quest for an uncluttered, contemporary look. The photography is beautiful, the design clean, the copy concise, the product appealing: a deserving winner. There is only one overall prize in this category but the judges felt that Worldwide Journeys deserved special mention for a classy and informative brochure with lots of mouthwatering photography and masses of information. Best of all, the prices for each product are given on the same page, so no nasty surprises when you get to the back of the brochure. Our judges also commended Roxton Bailey Robinson Worldwide for its Luxury Resorts brochure: lavish photography, a clean layout that is easy on the eye and succinct information boxes on every page that tell you exactly what you need to know about each resort. Best website of the year Winner: Trips Worldwide tripsworldwide.co.uk Tour operators' websites get better every time we look, and some of those not even shortlisted this time would have been worthy winners in other years. Quick and advanced search facilities are now standard, making them ever easier to use. A minor annoyance - which even our favourite sites were guilty of - was the trend for intro pages telling users to 'click to enter'. Why not just let us straight in? The judges also felt sites would benefit from linking to other information sources on the net. One that does was Himalayan Kingdoms (himalayankingdoms .com), even if their links pages are the weakest part of an excellent site. We liked Simpson Travel's (simpson-travel.com) simple design and its make-your-own brochure facility. This was also offered by Turquoise Holidays (turquoiseholidays.co.uk), which we considered to be the strongest site in pure design terms. Our winner, Trips Worldwide (tripsworldwide.co.uk) wasn't the most ambitious technically but had a distinct, appealing character and, our judges felt, gave great introductions to its destinations - and made you want to travel with them. *Voting based on holidays and travel prior to mergers or rebranding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
