His latest film, World Trade Center, caused practically zero controversy while, perversely, his frequently silly historical epic Alexander caused quite a furore. Nice to see that we still can't predict him. Stone might not seem as wilfully incendiary as before, but he's never dull, and his inventive and stylish films still bludgeon their message home with a level of hectoring few directors would attempt - you know when you've been \"Stoned\". Whatever you think of the man, his work or his politics, it's worth remembering he is, of course, a great talker. He's arrogant, intelligent, witty and talented, as a great director should be. Mark Lawson will be trying to get a word in edgeways. \u00b7 National Film Theatre, SE1, Wed 13 London Kurdish Film Festival London Back after a year off, this fixture returns somewhat invigorated, with the new addition of a shorts selection for schools. The shadow of Saddam is still cast over many of these films. Subjects such as military rule, subversion and displaced families occur frequently, although they're handled in different ways. Beritan, for instance, about a real-life resistance heroine, has a cast made up from actual mountain guerrilla fighters. Bahman Gobadi's prize-winning latest, Half Moon, follows a Kurdish musician trying to get to Iraq, while David And Layla is a New York romantic comedy. On the documentary front, Al-Anfal deals with Chemical Ali's war on the Kurdish people, and David The Tolhildan recounts the story of a Swiss man who gave up a comfortable life to join the PKK resistance movement. \u00b7 Rio Cinema, E8, Sat 9 to Dec 14 The London Film Festival On Tour, Nationwide Rather than go for the big names, this tour consists of five films less likely to get the exposure they deserve. New Zealand's No 2, breathes new life into the \"family reunion\" format. Will Oldham stars in the pleasantly meandering Old Joy, and Canada's Who Loves The Sun, asylum seeker drama Almost Adult and Filipino hit The Blossoming Of Maximo Oliveros complete the package. \u00b7 Various venues, Sat 9 to Mar 2007, www.lff.org.uk Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten London More group therapy than pop group, metal-percussionists Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten were a band few ever expected to stay the distance. But having recently celebrated their 25th anniversary, they are still a unique proposition, their music is complex rhythmically, melodically delicate and always powerful and meaningful. Now they've released their first concert film, Palast Der Republik, which receives its UK premiere here. The movie sees the group live up to their name (it means \"collapsing new buildings\") by performing in the half-demolished site of the East German Parliament in Berlin, aided by a 100-strong choir. And with a CV including guitarist for Nick Cave, arts lecturer, author and actor, Blixa Bargeld, their articulate frontman is on hand for what is sure to be a fascinating post-screening Q&amp;A. \u00b7 ICA, SW1, Thu 14"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
