The incident came in the 15th minute of United\u2019s 2-1 defeat at PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League. As Shaw burst into the home area Moreno made what appeared to be a two-footed tackle on the left-back. Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg that was operated on in Eindhoven that night. Moreno, who equalised for PSV, was named the player of the match by European football\u2019s governing body yet a United source said: \u201cWe find it strange and disappointing Uefa made him their man of the match after what happened to Luke.\u201d It is understood the award is decided by a Uefa reporting team who cover each Champions League tie. Moreno offered an apology to Shaw after the game and the Mexican insisted there had been no intent on his part. Following the incident Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the defender or award a penalty. Howard Webb, the former technical director of Professional Game Match Officials Limited, which oversees refereeing in England, backed the Italian official. \u201cLuke Shaw\u2019s injury was awful and I wish him a speedy recovery but I have got to say the referee made the right decision,\u201d he told BT Sport. \u201cMoreno stretches with his right leg, which plays the ball cleanly. His left leg makes some contact on the follow-through, but it is always tucked away under him and not aimed towards Luke Shaw. \u201cLuke is unlucky in that he gets his studs caught and twists, which causes the injury, but I think the referee made the right decision.\u201d After requiring nine minutes of treatment on the pitch Shaw was in tears in United\u2019s dressing room before going to hospital. Although his team-mates rallied impressively in the match to score before the interval through Memphis Depay, afterwards they were shocked at the severity of Shaw\u2019s injury. At the team dinner, there was near-silence among the squad and members of staff because of the emotion the 20-year-old\u2019s leg break had caused. On Wednesday morning United confirmed Shaw had been operated on and would remain in Eindhoven to begin his recovery from what medical staff described as a clean break. United, whose executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, visited Shaw in hospital on Wednesday, said: \u201cLuke underwent surgery for his injury and will remain in hospital in Eindhoven to continue his early recovery. Manchester United are grateful for the excellent care he is receiving and would like to thank everyone who has sent messages of support. A further update will be provided in due course.\u201d Mauricio Pochettino, who coached Shaw at Southampton, said he had spoken to Shaw on Wednesday morning. \u201cHe\u2019s much better today but it is always difficult when you have that type of injury.\u201d The Tottenham manager added: \u201cI give my support and wish him a speedy recovery. It\u2019s difficult because he was crying and you can understand that after a big injury \u2013 not only for the pain but for everything around the situation.\u201d Moreno said of the incident: \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. I don\u2019t remember, I just feel really bad because I was involved in the accident. I feel really sorry. I think it was not a foul, I think I played the ball, but in this kind of situation I don\u2019t care if it was a foul, I feel bad for him, for his family.\u201d The loss of Shaw is a blow to United. He had recaptured his best form after a difficult opening season following a \u00a330m transfer from Southampton. Shaw\u2019s pace had been harnessed by Louis van Gaal as an attacking threat, and the defender had been among the side\u2019s best players in their eight matches. United remain optimistic Shaw will play again this season, meaning he could yet be available for England in next summer\u2019s European Championship in France. Until Shaw returns Van Gaal\u2019s options to replace him at left-back are Daley Blind, Marcos Rojo and Ashley Young. Last year Blind acquitted himself well at left-back and it was he who slotted into Shaw\u2019s berth against PSV. Although Rojo has been used mostly as a central defender, he was Argentina\u2019s left-back at Brazil 2014 and was voted into the Fifa team of the tournament in the position. If Van Gaal wishes to replace Shaw\u2019s speed in attack he may be tempted to again use Young as an auxiliary left-back. The winger could then link with Depay as Shaw had successfully done."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
