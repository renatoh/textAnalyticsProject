More than three-quarters of these are subjected to forced labour by private companies or individuals rather than being victims of the state, the ILO study suggests. The report, A Global Alliance Against Forced labour, estimates that 2.4 million people worldwide are the victims of human trafficking. Launching the report in London, the head of ILO's programme against forced labour, Roger Plant, said: \"It is imperative to have some controls, so that you don't have an unprotected workforce.\" The report estimates the largest number of forced labourers is in Asia, at 9.5 million. A further 1.3 million are estimated to work in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 660,000 in sub-Saharan Africa. However, 360,000 victims work in industrialised countries."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
