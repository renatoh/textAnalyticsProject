Farrell is neither squat and rotund like the version portrayed by Danny DeVito in Tim Burton\u2019s Batman Returns, nor slight and awkward like the memorable Penguin played on TV by Robin Lord Taylor in Gotham. Many observers had expected the role to go to Josh Gad, the Frozen and Book of Mormon stalwart who campaigned heavily for the role on Twitter and seemed the perfect choice, should Reeves be headed in an operatic, larger-than-life direction for his reinvention of the Batman myth. That it is the Irishman who will pull on Cobblepot\u2019s trademark top hat and tuxedo may be instructive about this forthcoming vision of Gotham City. Farrell is perfectly capable of hamming it up \u2013 there are those of us who are still reeling from his toe-curlingly oirish Bullseye in the misfiring Daredevil (2003). But he still seems likely to be a more understated Penguin than those we have seen in the past. A more obvious choice to play the villain, if Reeves wanted a furniture-chewing Cobblepot, might have been his old pal Andy Serkis \u2013 yet the latter has been cast as Alfred Pennyworth instead. Farrell will be competing for villain space with Paul Dano\u2019s Riddler, and to a lesser extent (for her loyalties are often mixed), Zo\u00eb Kravitz\u2019s Catwoman. His challenge is to stand out from the crowd, and make his version of the umbrella-toting bad guy the definitive one. DeVito\u2019s great achievement was to simultaneously encourage the audience to sympathise with his torrid existence and reel from his cruelty and sideshow-freak schtick. Farrell, though a capable character actor, has the demeanour of a leading man not a gimpy outsider. So Reeves will have to paint the story in a different way to carry it forward. This syncs nicely with the Planet of the Apes film-maker\u2019s rumoured neo-noir take on the material, and avowed aim to restore the caped crusader\u2019s mantle of the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest detective\u201d, rather than recapture the pantomime bombast of the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher years. The less said the better about Ben Affleck\u2019s appearances in the misfiring, dull as ditchwater and now almost forgotten DC \u201cextended universe\u201d films. Might including both the Penguin and the Riddler in the same film end up crowding things? That depends on Reeves\u2019 long-term plans for his movie and any sequels. One of the two seems likely to be the film\u2019s main antagonist, with the other cast as a more shadowy figure, perhaps with their place in the picture to emerge more fully in subsequent films. If so, the clever money would be on Dano\u2019s character surfacing as the immediate threat. The star of There Will Be Blood can do unhinged mania so well that it would be a huge pity if Reeves did not fully unleash him on Pattinson\u2019s new dark knight. If such a \u201cfast stream, slow stream\u201d approach is taken, it will surely be Farrell\u2019s Penguin, with his traditional position as a totem of the Gotham underworld, who finds himself watching patiently from the shadows, a master-manipulator waiting for his moment. The good news for Reeves is that Batman, perhaps more than any other superhero, is capable of sustaining a myriad enemies at a time: his famed \u201crogues gallery\u201d of nemeses. But there is a warning hanging in the air here, too. As Schumacher found to his cost with the over-packed Batman Forever and Batman &amp; Robin, it is when the camera does not know where to rest that potentially heavyweight figures can suddenly appear gossamer thin and lacking in threat. Of course, Nolan had no such issues, despite cramming Bane, Catwoman, Talia al Ghul and the Scarecrow into The Dark Knight Rises. And therein lies the greatest poser: how have so many film-makers, working with essentially the same source material, ended up with such vastly different results when wrestling with Batman?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
