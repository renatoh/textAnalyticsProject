When they decide one might be useful, they ask for a simple one. \"I just want to make phone calls,\" they say. \"Maybe I'll send a text message.\" You or I might see this as an opportunity to serve the public and sell them a phone that's easy to use. How laughable! Certain companies see a much better opportunity. Where customers know absolutely nothing about phones, intimidate them enough and they'll buy any old rubbish. The phone industry is subtle. The Nokia 1100 does look simple. It's thin, has a rubbery edge and big keys on a moulded keyboard. It doesn't have a camera or a music player. It looks like a slimmed down version of the Nokia 3310 that everyone had in 2000. So that must make it simple, right? Wrong. It's not simple. It's obsolete. It's old technology being dumped on the vulnerable. In 2000 we used Nokia's 3310 because it was the best thing available. The industry was still learning how to make a usable phone. We suffered with it, we've moved on and we're not going back. Not so the newbie with the 1100. The people most uncertain about technology have plucked up the courage to buy a phone, and had their confidence utterly destroyed. It's a \"simple\" phone, but the horrid menu structure of the early Nokia makes no sense. It can't store your friends' mobile and work numbers in the same place, like a real phone can. Each number is a separate entry in the contact list, burning up the 250 possible entries faster than you expected. Want to turn predictive text off? You'll have to find someone to do it for you. I can see the torch on the phone is useful. And its 16-day battery life could help in parts of the third world (where Nokia is also dumping it). But calling this a \"simple\" phone is a step too far. It may use older, simpler technology, but that makes it harder, not easier to use. DOS has fewer features than Windows or the Macintosh, but it's harder to use. The Model T Ford is \"simpler\" than today's cars, but you need a hand crank to start it. Twin-tub washing machines have no electronics, but I'd rather use a modern front-loader. Nokia, if you want to make an easy phone, don't start with an old one and pretend that makes it easy. Take a nice modern design, remove unnecessary features and test it properly. And T-Mobile, if you're going to unload this stuff on the public, get the price right. \u00a350 for this is a crime. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
