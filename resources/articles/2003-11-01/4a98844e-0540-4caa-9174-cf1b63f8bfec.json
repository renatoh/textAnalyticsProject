He created a lunar globe and a large-scale painting of the moon in the Radcliffe observatory in Oxford. Russell's better-preserved painting of the moon is astonishing and looks exactly, on first view, like a photograph taken either from space or with a powerful, modern telescope. It is a still, detailed landscape of the moon's mountains and craters and other marks, mapped with consummate accuracy and realism in about 1795. But is it art? The question comes back again with a vengeance looking at this incredible painting. Surely this is a scientific more than aesthetic product. It is revolutionary; it ends, brutally and factually, centuries of mythological speculation. Clearly the disc in this painting is uninhabited, a dead rock in space. Russell's painting reminds us that British curiosity would lead, with The Origin of Species, to the end of universal religious belief. And yet this picture, which seems to be something other than art, is a classic product of British landscape painting. Landscape came to dominate British painting in the early 19th century. Constable and Turner were, simply, the greatest landscape painters of all time, meticulous observers, scientific to the point of eccentricity. Constable's cloud studies rank with Stubbs's Anatomy of the Horse. At the beginning of the 1820s Constable, painting on Hampstead Heath, looked up at the big London sky with meteorological inquisitiveness. He painted pictures that are all sky. Constable's oil sketches of cloud formations are pieces of research. They are documented by the artist like scientific experiments. \"Hampstead. Sept. II, 1821,\" he writes on the back of one study of a sky, \"10 to 11 morning under the sun - Clouds silvery grey on warm ground sultry - Light wind to the S.W., fine all day but rain in the night following.\" On August 11 1999, Cornwall experienced a total eclipse. Various events took place to mark, celebrate, exploit and enjoy such a powerful natural occurrence. Artworks were commissioned, and you might think that spectacle and drama were guaranteed in any art inspired by the disappearance of the sun at 11 minutes past 11 in the morning. Tacita Dean, who the year before had been shortlisted for the Turner prize, chose to film the event on a dairy farm overlooking the sea - Burnewhall Farm, pronounced \"Banewl\", the title of Dean's 63-minute film. In it, a herd of black and white cows spend the morning in their usual way, clumping down a lane, feeding in a green field. At a certain moment the light disappears. The cows lie down as if it is night. It is filmed in the spirit of Constable: pastoral, agrarian Britain observed close up, in its quietest routines. Clouds, fields and then darkness. Constable's preoccupation with his \"childhood scenes\" in the Stour Valley roots his art in a world of honest natural observation. One of his favourite books was Gilbert White's Natural History of Selbourne (1813), which he said \"shows what a real love for nature will do\". His paintings take what he praised as White's \"clear and intimate view of nature\" to a pitch of unrivalled intensity. Constable is the naturalist as poet. The observation of hedgerows, rivers, shire horses, rumpled lanes and cottage gardens in his paintings is charged and visionary; but it is the vision of a scientist, not a seer. Constable laughed at the prophetic William Blake for his lack of naturalism. Constable pursued his studies remote from the world, which was how he liked it. But JMW Turner had his own self-appointed spokesman, who gave his paintings a theoretical dimension. For John Ruskin, Turner was a moral scientist, his art superior to almost any other, not because it was beautiful, but because it was true. Ruskin published Modern Painters, his awesome, digressive defence of Turner, in five volumes between 1843 and 1860, the last volume contemporaneous with The Origin of Species. If Ruskin's cosmology is more moralising than Darwin's, his faith in science is equal to that of the subversive naturalist. If Modern Painters is the greatest book of art criticism that exists, it is also a great book about geology, meteorology and oceanography. Ruskin's chapter titles given an idea of his emotional involvement with the natural world: Of the Open Sky; Of Truth of Clouds: Thirdly, of the Region of the Rain-Cloud; Of Truth of Vegetation; Of the Central Mountains. Turner, argues Ruskin, is not just a shallow observer of surface appearances but an analyst, a theoretical scientist who reveals the inner structures of mountains, the forces at work in the sea - for Ruskin, the greatest scientist of all. If Ruskin wanted to give an idea of what hills are like, how they are structured, \"I should not refer to any geological drawings, but I should take the Loch Coriskin of Turner.\" Landscape in Turner attains the sublime. It survives in British art in the form of the grotesque. Jake and Dinos Chapman's Hell is a landscape tableau made with the enthusiasm of railway modellers. A volcano, which might have been painted by Wright of Derby, spews out a vortex of forces whose dynamism evokes Turner's energised nature. Hell is perhaps the consummate vision of natural history and of landscape in contemporary British art: an entire model world. But its energy is monstrous. What emerges from the volcano is a legion of sadomasochist toy soldiers in Nazi uniforms torturing and destroying each other in sublime apoplectic original chaos amid trees and rocks that might come out of Chinese miniature art. This is the beginning and end of the world, parodically Darwinian. The survival of the fittest. Empirical and scientific, sometimes not seeming to be art at all, the great tradition in British painting is not so far from the art of the Turner prize years as we think. There is no damning contrast between the painting of Turner and Constable, Stubbs and Wright, and the non-painting of today. In fact, if you wanted a movement to describe British art now, empiricism might be it. But is it art? The question implies a gulf between art and the lumpen facts we live among. A bed may be placed in an art gallery but it is still a bed. A shark can be suspended in a tank but it is still a shark. Nothing is transformed here, nothing is transfigured. One way of understanding this art is as a distrust - of displayed emotions, words, abstractions. Tracey Emin's bed, shortlisted for the Turner prize and exhibited at Tate Britain in 1999, offers itself as nothing but evidence of the artist's physical being. She slept in it, spent days rotting in it. The physical remains - tights, empty bottle, stains - are intimate raw facts. The viewer is invited to draw conclusions. It is an empirical exercise. Emotion is implied by its physical traces. It is this emphasis on the tangible, the empirically observable facts, rather than some vague \"conceptualism\", that distinguishes the British art of the past 15 years. Richard Wilson's 1988 installation 20:50, a room-filling tank of sump oil, so perfectly reflective that it confuses the eye, is a test of perception, and in its latest manifestation in the Saatchi Gallery continues to catch the unwary with substantial empirical proof of what it really is. Since that work was first made, in the same year that Damien Hirst curated the group show Freeze, art has got ever more tangible, solid and measurable. It's as if the very language of art, the idea of the aesthetic, were mistrusted. And it is. The expressiveness of painting is far too flowery to be believed any more, it seems. It would be naive to think this question - is it art? - had never occurred to the artist. The worst art of the present moment seems complacent and unquestioning in its iconoclasm. The kind of art that assumes there is no need to explain why video is better than painting is invariably dull. This is the ritualised self-defining activity of the art world and not much more. The reason British art was impressive in the 1990s is that it was not in the least assured or relaxed about what it was. The best British art of this period is an empirical experiment. Do you experience it richly enough for it to be art? If so, this says something about who we are, what our world is like, what the time is. When Constable painted the sky, the empiricism that art shared with science was founded on optimism. Knowledge was making the world richer. The British art of the turn of the 21st century asks some of the same questions, but with mutant answers. Knowledge, now, seems frightening. Terrors that long precede modernity - death, disease, the end of the world - stalk a scientific art grown apocalyptic. But the character of British art, the investigative and sceptical, endures. In Damien Hirst's most recent exhibition, a Victorian natural history display cabinet is turned upside down, and the stones on its shelves hang disturbingly in space. Hirst is a great artist in a great tradition. In his exhibition at White Cube, dead butterflies float in acres of paint, as if this art had been made by some desperate scientific aesthete who, even as he tried to capture the beauty of nature, killed the thing he loved: like the boy fishing in the reeds in The Hay-Wain, like Thomas Gainsborough's daughters chasing butterflies. Nature is dead; long live nature."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
