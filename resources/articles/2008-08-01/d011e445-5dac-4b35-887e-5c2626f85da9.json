A few decades ago the idea that bands would exist past their 30s was ludicrous, now the baby-boomers are into their 60s and still they plough on. Brian Wilson brilliantly nailed the elliptical beauty of the Californian lifestyle 45 years ago - so why can't he just leave it alone? That Lucky Old Sun is full of Beach Boys-isms - the massed choral voices, the jaunty piano, the strident strings - but it's just not any good at all. When Wilson sings about surfer girls and Mexican girls and Southern California and first love, truly, the only emotion you feel is sadness. Every single note feels forced, in hock to a sound and a set of attitudes that date from a time before many of us were born. Please, let this be the end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
