Another defeat, in Saturday\u2019s third-place play-off against Holland, would increase the public\u2019s anger towards Scolari following the 7-1 semi-final humiliation against Germany and the coach is desperate to end the summer with a show of strength. \u201cI know my career will be marked by this defeat but we have an obligation to move on and think about the next goal, which in this case is the match for third place on Saturday in Bras\u00edlia,\u201d the Brazil coach said. \u201cI know it\u2019s a much smaller dream than we all wanted but we have to honour the shirt of the national team.\u201d Scolari will meet officials from the Brazilian Football Confederation after the match to discuss his future. On Friday the confederation\u2019s president-elect, Marco Polo Del Nero, said Scolari should keep his job because of the good work he has done during his 19 months in charge. \u201cTo me, he stays,\u201d he told the Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper. \u201cWhat happened was a tactical error. That was the problem. But we all make mistakes. It can happen to anyone. The important thing is that he did a good job. The campaign and the preparations were good. A base exists.\u201d Scolari, too, insists he has done a good job with the players he has at his disposal. \u201cWe made the semi-finals, the top four teams in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there were a lot of good teams that were knocked out before us. Some supporters at the Est\u00e1dio Mineir\u00e3o for the Germany match burned a Brazilian flag on Tuesday night and many left after 29 minutes, when the hosts were 5-0 down. Those who remained booed their team off at half-time and then in the second half they cheered and clapped the Germans as a sign of their disapproval towards the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o. The captain, Thiago Silva, wants the home fans inside the stadium in Bras\u00edlia to get behind their team. \u201cThis is a bad time so we need strength from our fans,\u201d said the defender, who returns to the starting XI after missing the Germany game through suspension. \u201cI guarantee that we will play this Saturday\u2019s game like it was the final.\u201d The Holland coach, Louis van Gaal, also spoke of the match\u2019s importance on Friday, saying he wants to sign off with a win to become the first coach of the Dutch national team to go unbeaten in normal and extra time at a World Cup. \u201cWe haven\u2019t lost a match,\u201d he said. \u201cI have two and a half days to analyse and watch Brazil and I don\u2019t want to leave anything to chance so I have been focusing on Brazil and I hope I can prepare my players in such a way that we can play a good match, win the game and write history.\u201d Van Gaal remains convinced, though, that the World Cup was set up to favour Brazil. \u201cI will stick to the facts,\u201d he said. \u201cThe facts are that Brazil started first. And Brazil again has played first again and we played a day later. \u201cThese are the facts. I am not going to beat around the bush. Then you know what the implications are if that is the case. The question is why? I think Scolari should think about that if he wants to do that and is allowed to do that.\u201d Van Gaal\u2019s annoyance has clearly been heightened by the fact that Brazil have had another day to prepare for the third-place play-off. \u201cWe have one day less than Brazil,\u201d Van Gaal added. \u201cWe have to get into shape in two and a half days, which physically is hard.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
