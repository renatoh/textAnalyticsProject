The project, set up in 2001, is an archive of candidinterviews with those directlyinvolved in paramilitary violence between 1969 and 1994 in Northern Ireland. Participants were promised that these interviews would be released only to historians, researchers and journalists once they were dead. But now the PSNI is going to the courts in the US in an attempt to obtain all the project\u2019s tapes, including those in which ex-IRA and Ulster Volunteer Force members talk about their roles during the Troubles. The move could have serious consequences for political stability in Northern Ireland. To date, the PSNI has successfully pursued the Boston tapes relating to only one crime from the Troubles: the IRA\u2019s kidnapping, murder and secret burial of Jean McConville in 1972. This led last May to the arrest of the Sinn F\u00e9in president, Gerry Adams. He was questioned but not charged about claims from former republican comrades he gave the IRA an order to \u201cdisappear\u201d the widow to avoid a public backlash over the decision to kill her because the Provisionals believed she was an informer. However, in a court case in Belfast on Thursday, another participant in the Belfast Project, the ex-UVF veteran Winston \u201cWinkie\u201d Rea, it was revealed that the PSNI had moved to seize his testimony as well. Police have since announced that they are pursuing all of the Boston College\u2019s archive. \u201cDetectives in Serious Crimes Branch have initiated steps to obtain all the material as part of the Belfast Project,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cThis is in line with the PSNI\u2019s statutory duty to investigate fully all matters of serious crime, including murder.\u201d Last week, Ed Moloney, journalist and former director of the Belfast Project, accused the PSNI and the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland of seeking all the material to create the impression that they were not just interested in using the tapes to investigate republican crimes only. \u201cThe secret efforts to obtain interviews allegedly given to Boston College by Winston Rea are a pathetic attempt by the security authorities to demonstrate balance in their efforts to invade a confidential academic archive in the United States. \u201cHaving previously expended all their energies on attempting to obtain IRA interviews and in the process drawing the ire of Irish-America, the PSNI and the PPS are now trying to show Americans that they are even-handed by pursuing a well-known loyalist figure.\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
