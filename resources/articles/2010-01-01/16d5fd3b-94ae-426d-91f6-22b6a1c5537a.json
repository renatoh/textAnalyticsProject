Neuroscientist Lady Greenfield is taking legal action after the Royal Institution of Great Britain (RI) decided her post of full-time director was no longer affordable. The professor of pharmacology at Lincoln College, Oxford University, said she was \"saddened and dismayed\" by the decision and was taking legal advice. Her departure comes after a \u00a322m refurbishment of the Royal Institution's premises in Mayfair, London, which she initiated, left the organisation so short of funds that auditors questioned its financial viability. The strategy, which included a complete refit of the historic Faraday lecture hall and an upmarket bar and restaurant, was criticised by some on the governing council and board of trustees as a risky financial gamble. In a statement, Greenfield said: \"I am saddened and dismayed by developments and dispute the lawfulness of the current decision-making procedure. As well as contesting the legitimacy of the process, I will be presenting a claim in the employment tribunal which will include allegations of sex discrimination. \"I am the only female who has been appointed to this iconic post throughout the 211-year history of the Royal Institution, and I cannot see how this decision can be in the best interests of the organisation or its members.\" In a statement, the institution said Greenfield had left after a strategic review concluded the organisation no longer required a full-time director. The statement added: \"Baroness Greenfield has played a leading role, not only in the development of the RI, but in the wider scientific community through her work in popularising science. \"In her 12 years as director of the RI, she was the driving force behind numerous initiatives, notably, the recent visionary refurbishment project and the renowned Science Media Centre. Baroness Greenfield leaves with our thanks and we wish her all the very best in her future endeavours.\" Greenfield is regarded as a forthright and colourful character whose love of neuroscience, entrepreneurial drive and determination not to conform to the stereotype of dull scientist secured her position as a role model for female scientists. She has donned designer outfits for Vogue and Hello magazines, and on being ranked 14th most influential woman in Britain by Harpers and Queen magazine, quipped: \"Dolly Parton came ninth.\" She was awarded the CBE in 2000 and made a \"people's peer\" in 2001. The Royal Institution is best known for its Christmas lectures, which were introduced by Michael Faraday in 1825 as a way of exciting children about science at a time when organised education was not widespread. The lectures have continued every year since, breaking only for the second world war."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
