This sentiment was reiterated by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, in comments made regarding the resignation of Democratic congresswoman Katie Hill. Her departure came after an ongoing campaign against her that included the leaking of naked photographs. \u201cIt goes to show you, we should say to young candidates, and to kids in kindergarten really, be careful when transmitting photos,\u201d Pelosi said. It is telling that the admonishment was saved for the victim, not the perpetrator. Though the source of the photos remains unconfirmed, Hill has said they were provided by her estranged husband (he has said he was hacked). Her husband having access to naked images of her and choosing to leak them would be as \u201ccareless\u201d on Hill\u2019s part as him having access to her funds in a joint bank account and choosing to steal from her. \u201cTaking care\u201d simply doesn\u2019t cut it when it comes to revenge porn \u2013 just ask the celebrities who were targeted by hackers in 2016, naked photos of them leaked online, regardless of whatever security measures they had in place. The solution suggested by critics is to opt out of taking or sending nude pictures altogether \u2013 as Whoopi Goldberg advised when the actor Bella Thorne decided to share naked photos of herself online that a hacker was threatening to make public. \u201cIf you\u2019re famous, I don\u2019t care how old you are. You don\u2019t take nude photos of yourself,\u201d said Goldberg on the US talkshow, The View \u2013 conveniently forgetting that revenge porn is something that affects civilians as well as celebrities. Thorne had been due to go on the show, but didn\u2019t \u201cfeel like being beaten down by a bunch of older women\u201d. There does, at times, appear to be a generational disconnect, with victim-blaming regarding nudes fast becoming the \u201cHow short was her skirt?\u201d of the 2010s. Even if no other woman on Earth sent another nude again, nudes would still leak. In 2012, Kate Middleton not only had topless images of her sunbathing published without her consent, but the images were taken without her permission, too. The same happened to the musician Sia, who deployed the tactic Thorne did when she learned they were being sold on the internet. \u201cSomeone is apparently trying to sell naked photos of me to my fans,\u201d she wrote, alongside the image in question. \u201cSave your money, here it is for free.\u201d If revenge porn is something we hope to end, perhaps it is time to focus on those seeking the revenge instead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
