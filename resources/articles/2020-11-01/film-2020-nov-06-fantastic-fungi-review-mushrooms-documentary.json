It starts out as a slickly shot nature film and then morphs into an impassioned screed on how mushrooms can \u2013 essentially \u2013 save the world. The central figure is Paul Stamets, a Denzil Dexterish figure who studies fungi in Washington state and is an advocate for the life form\u2019s centrality to harmonious natural systems. (Though quite how that squares with developing lethal types of mould to exterminate termites is never explained.) If this film resembles a souped-up TED talk that\u2019s because it presumably took wing from Stamets\u2019 own 2009 TED talk, Six Ways Mushrooms Can Save the World, and the film contains copious excerpts from his various on-stage lectures: there\u2019s no denying he is a charismatic and persuasive speaker, both to camera and to live audiences. This film, likewise, is a treat for the eye and ear: the liberal use of speeded-up footage of growth and decay is unfailingly spectacular, while Stamets and fellow interviewees have a gift for a memorable turn of phrase. \u201cWe will forever exist together within the micro-molecular matrix,\u201d Stamets says at one point. \u201cMushrooms don\u2019t give a shit,\u201d says academic/author Michael Pollan, at another. Though the fungus-eye-view voiceover, by Brie Larson, with its breathy, quasi-visionary utterances, is less impressive. Stamets\u2019 message is that fungi (which he, like the other US and Canadian interviewees here, pronounce with an off-putting soft \u201cg\u201d) can be put to use in a variety of helpful ways: cleaning up oil spills, assisting chemotherapy and \u2013 a little more controversially \u2013 treating mental illness. It\u2019s this latter point, which is dwelled on with rather more enthusiasm than anything else, that you feel is the deep motivation for the hippy silver-fox speakers who pass across the screen. For long stretches Fantastic Fungi resembles the final sequence of 2001: A Space Odyssey, with swirling kaleidoscopic visuals and a solemnly intoned devotion to the mystical experience. Whether you buy the fungal head trip is a matter of personal inclination; there\u2019s quite a bit of shamanistic waffle and airy speculation about brain evolution to get through. Perhaps most eye-opening is the brief mention of fungus\u2019 use in battling a potential pandemic \u2013 the news clip of a US president (George W Bush, as it happens) taking the threat of a pandemic seriously like a bulletin from another age. \u2022 Fantastic Fungi is available on digital platforms from 9 November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
