Speaking to the UN security council in the wake of US secretary of state Colin Powell's address, Mr Straw said that Iraq's deceit on weapons of mass destruction had been \"laid bare\". He said Mr Powell's 70-minute speech had exposed Iraq's lack of cooperation with UN weapons inspectors. \"The truth is that, however strong the inspectors' powers, without cooperation they could never be sure of finding all Iraqi weapons of mass destruction,\" Mr Straw added. \"Saddam Hussein is defying the will of every nation represented here. He is gambling that we will lose our nerve rather than enforce our will. \"The Iraqi document [on weapons] submitted to the UN was long on repetition and short on fact. It was neither full, nor accurate, nor complete. By anyone's definition, it was a false statement. \"Its central premise, that Iraq possesses no weapons of mass destruction, is a lie. Iraq has no intention of relinquishing its weapons of mass destruction. \"Instead of open admissions and transparency, we have a charade, where a veneer of superficial co-operation masks wilful concealment.\" Mr Straw accused President Saddam's regime of spurning its final opportunity to bring a peaceful end to the crisis. He said that the UK did not want war, but warned that time \"is now very short\". \"Our decisions must have a force beyond words,\" he told the security council, echoing Mr Powell's statement that the UN \"must not shirk from the task that it ahead of us\". French foreign minister Dominique de Villepin said weapons inspections should be strengthened, with a full-time monitor overseeing the process in Baghdad. Describing the use of force against Iraq as something that \"can only be a final recourse\", he insisted: \"We must move on to a new stage and further strengthen the inspections. \"Given the choice between military intervention and an inspections regime which is inadequate because of a failure to cooperate on Iraq's part, we must choose the decisive reinforcement of the means of inspection. This is today what France is proposing.\" China's foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, urged the 15-member security council to give inspectors more time to carry out their task. He said that inspectors had been working \"very hard\", and added: \"It is their view that now they are not in a position to draw conclusions. \"We should respect the views of the two UN inspection agencies and support the continuation of their work.\" Those sentiments were echoed by the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, who called for the allegations made in Mr Powell's statement to be confirmed by inspectors inside Iraq. Mr Ivanov said: \"The information given to us today will require very serious and thorough study. Experts in our countries must get down to analysing it and drawing the appropriate conclusions from it. \"Baghdad must give the inspectors answers to the questions that we have heard in the presentation by the US secretary of state.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
