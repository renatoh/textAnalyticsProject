To be sure, some of the New Age types make a deliberate claim on the green and pleasant land. Glastonbury, ley lines, Albion: yes, yes. But it's more than that. Festivals are our modern version of pastoral - the way we urban English can imagine ourselves reconnected to the ancestral earth. Gwyneth Jones has written a novel in which a festival swallows up the whole country. She is one of Britain's most brilliant sci-fi writers, and one of the few authors of SF worldwide to understand the scale of opportunity the genre offers for the imaginative reconfiguration of our categories of familiarity and strangeness, thought and feeling, gender and individuality. Her magnum opus so far, the White Queen trilogy, was a rich, sad, allusive story, which described an alien-occupied Earth using the same kind of palette Kipling used for India. Her prose is always elegant in a dishevelled way. Bold as Love is tinged by Kipling too, as it delves into Englishness, but this time the effect she is aiming for is more like Puck of Pook's Hill on class-A drugs. It is a curious piece of work altogether. It begins one summer in the near future as the nations of the UK go their separate ways, releasing the English to work out for the first time in centuries who they think they are. The new English government signs up some of the musicians performing in the \"Dissolution Tour\", hoping for a bit of youthful credibility; but as society crumbles away under the pressures of climate change, rampant disease and anti-technological terrorism, the rock stars find themselves with real power. \"Stone Age fame\" becomes the source of true authority as the island darkens. Modern life is over. All England draws towards the condition of being a festival site. Since Jones is a good and subtle writer, the texture of this unlikely story is wonderfully maintained. At the core of the book is a three-way relationship between a mixed-race guitarist given to attacks of responsibility, a chilly and well-spoken nymphet singer, and a giant West Country technohead with a history of poor impulse control to expiate. Jones's attention to the way the dynamic develops would dignify any straight novel. Subtle, too, is the way that the lineaments of the triangle central to ancient Britain begin to emerge out of the sarky chat of the modern one. Ax, Fiorinda and Sage begin (of course) to tread out the steps of Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot. What else could happen when the ancient glamour takes hold? As in Le Morte D'Arthur , so long as the three of them are united, Camelot stands. Bold as Love ends well, with good king Ax wishing time would stop and leave him safe at his apex of happiness with his lover and his friend. But it won't: there's another volume to come, called Castles Made of Sand . The salient oddity of Bold as Love is that its achievement is rooted not in the festival scene of 2001, but in the world of 1971. It substantiates the dreams not of present-day apocalypse-minded teenagers, but of their counterparts 30 years ago, who read Michael Moorcock's Jerry Cornelius novels and relished the fantasy of the Rolling Stones playing gigs in the rubble of liberated cities. Jimi Hendrix played \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at Woodstock; Jones has an equally sexy guitar hero put the reverb into \"I Vow to Thee, My Country\". This book reopens the door to a particular stylised world next to our own, where the slender-hipped male heroes of pop culture are freed from time and place to do cool, violent deeds. It's a rock'n'roll world, but it's English. It's a world where the young Mick Jagger is always to be found jamming in the Hundred Acre Wood, his gun lying on the grass beside him among the forget-me-nots."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
