No matter how alien our new world looked at the start of the coronavirus shutdown, you could say one thing for sure: eventually, this will be the fault of Raheem Sterling. I know that so-called experts will rewind through the testing failures, to the herd immunity row, to the 250,000-strong Cheltenham Festival, to the shifting epicentre of the pandemic, to Spain, to Italy, to South Korea, to air travel, to Wuhan, to patient zero, to the bat in the Chinese wet market. But in a very real sense \u2013 perhaps the realest \u2013 this whole thing traces way back beyond all that. Back, in fact, to UK humankind\u2019s oldest enemy: young men who play in the Premier League. Even in the good times, the same people who thought Brexit was totally worth the nursing crisis it vastly deepened can never wait to tell you how many NHS nurses a footballer\u2019s contract is worth. As discussed frequently in this space, nurses are criminally undervalued. But strangely, it\u2019s only ever footballers whose remuneration is discussed in these precise relative terms. The footballers-nurses discussion takes place in an exchange market in which only two currencies are traded. You rarely hear anyone convert how many nurses\u2019 salaries we could have had instead of a Libyan intervention that helped create a failed state, or instead of some \u00a353m drawings for a garden bridge, or instead of a load of nuclear weapons we wouldn\u2019t even notionally be allowed to use unless the Americans told us to. And without wishing to downgrade the spectator pleasure anyone took from seeing a north African country slide into civil war \u2013 GET IN! \u2013 people actually like football. They watch it. They frequently claim to live for it. They get more bang for their buck for it than they do with a botched military intervention, which effectively plays behind closed doors. (Though Rupert Murdoch usually owns the rights to both.) It has been mere days since a few clubs (not players) began revealing their plans to apply for government aid for furloughed support staff, and footballers are already getting it in the neck for not having what we might call an oven-ready formalised response to it. On Wednesday, we heard from the Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport select committee chair, Julian Knight, about the \u201cmoral vacuum\u201d of the Premier League, which means so much more coming from an MP who literally wrote a book on tax avoidance. For now, the question seemingly frothing off everyone\u2019s lips is: are Premier League players taking a pay cut? The answer, as of Friday afternoon, is yes: 30%. Yet to put that into perspective, last year Forbes estimated that just 12 of the richest Premier League owners had a combined worth of \u00a374bn. Are the owners taking a pay cut? Or to put it into another perspective: the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association is run by the galaxy\u2019s highest-paid union boss, one Gordon Taylor, who took home more than \u00a32m last year, yet continually fails his members in a variety of ways, and somehow managed to head off a coup and string out his already 41-year tenure at the top by commissioning a review \u2013 a full 16 months ago \u2013 into how the union is run. Is he taking a pay cut? Or to put it into arguably the most relevant perspective: it has now been months since Boris Johnson began to be briefed about the threat of the coronavirus; many weeks since he was able to watch its ravages take hold on our European doorstep, yet persisted in a mitigation strategy that left the UK\u2019s response a remarkable outlier; almost three weeks since he radically changed course; two weeks since he promised 25,000 tests a day; and a good 48 hours since it was revealed that his government\u2019s pledges had seen just 2,000 NHS frontline workers tested in total. Is he taking a pay cut? Because I want to be sure he\u2019s personally paying the taxpayer \u00a3350m a week to be prime minister before we give one second of his airtime to the Newcastle midfield. Disappointingly, Matt Hancock seized on this piece of footballer misdirection in his comeback briefing on Thursday night. That said, the health secretary\u2019s return was relatively welcome, not least because mere hours before, Nigel Farage had broken another 14-second silence to demand his sacking. (Mr Farage, a 56-year-old occasional freelance journalist, called for Hancock\u2019s replacement with a tough outsider who \u201cgets things done\u201d. Louis Van Gaal?) Hancock\u2019s briefing was a vast improvement on the previous day\u2019s effort with alleged business secretary Alok Sharma, when we had to accept the government was not so much playing its reserves but its most talentless fan, who duly spent the entire fixture running away from the ball. As time has worn on, these daily three-person televised set-pieces resemble the prelude to an Apprentice firing. Who will you be bringing back into the boardroom with you, Alok, and attempting to offload the blame on to? The only thing missing is Alan Sugar shouting: \u201c30 bladdy ventilators?! That is a bladdy disgrace!\u201d Hancock unveiled his Five Pillars strategy, which is arguably compromised by the fact that Pillar One is not \u201cProcure a Tardis\u201d. As former Conservative cabinet minister Greg Clark, now chair of the science committee, warned on Thursday, the UK is now \u201cobviously too late\u201d to recover the time lost by failing to mass-test NHS staff. Our best hope is a \u201cDunkirk\u201d strategy of allowing smaller labs to assist the effort. Ah, Dunkirk. There\u2019s something slightly heartbreaking about watching experts apparently judging that this might be the only language the government understands. Clark himself was only echoing the plea of Paul Nurse, chairman of the respected Francis Crick Institute, who this week urgently tried to find the government\u2019s sweet spot. \u201cInstitutes like ours are coming together with a Dunkirk spirit,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe government has put some big boats, destroyers, in place. That\u2019s a bit more cumbersome to get working and we wish them all the luck to do that, but we little boats can contribute as well.\u201d This desperate appeal strategy has the flavour of giving a toddler a potty branded with its major obsession. Ooh, look at this thing! What\u2019s that then? You like the Teletubbies, don\u2019t you? Shall we go over and have a closer look? This, but with imploring the government to do what it takes to even get near to adequate virus testing. See, it could be like Dunkirk! You like reading about Dunkirk, don\u2019t you? Shall we make it a fun Dunkirk game and get some health workers tested, yes? Aw, who\u2019s a big boy, Churchill? We began this column with one of the great laws of British public life, and we end with another: the pathological insistence on filtering everything through the prism of the second world war. It runs from Johnson\u2019s Churchill obsession through Nigel Farage\u2019s career misunderstanding of what a single minute of the conflict meant, to people who weren\u2019t born in the blitz telling you \u201cwe survived the blitz\u201d. We are never more than six feet away from the events of 75 to 80 years ago. Let\u2019s hope we get the three points this time, too. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
