No, I wasn\u2019t a fantasist. Or, at least, the fantasy wasn\u2019t mine alone. The escapades were thanks to my compulsive reading of Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials. Northern Lights, the first book in the His Dark Materials trilogy, was published in 1995, when I was four, so it was a few years after it came out that I fell for Pullman\u2019s writing. But when I finally did \u2026 boy, did I fall hard. I zoned out of sleepovers with friends, family dinners, and \u2013 on one occasion \u2013 my brother\u2019s wedding as I joined Pullman\u2019s heroine, Lyra, on thrilling Arctic voyages and skirmishes in parallel universes. If I detailed all the reasons I loved the trilogy, I\u2019d take up the whole newspaper. But it comes down to three things. First, I loved Lyra who, thanks to her daring and mischief, allowed me to glimpse what life would be like were I not such a timid teacher\u2019s pet. Second, there were Pullman\u2019s irresistible \u201cdaemons\u201d \u2013 a kind of animal self. A companion who could shape-shift from seal to snow leopard seemed an improvement on my drab imaginary friend, Cheryl. And third, it felt \u2026 rebellious. I had a cosy Church of Wales upbringing where the history of Christianity was presented as an uninterrupted stretch of benevolence. Pullman\u2019s scrutiny of the authoritarian side of religion was as invigorating as a blast of the Arctic air I\u2019d read about in his books. I grew up, and finally consented to read a few other books \u2013 but my devotion to Pullman never diminished. Which is why I\u2019m positively writhing with excitement about the all-star TV adaptation which kicks off on Sunday night on BBC One. The palpable hype among my generation is proof of something I\u2019ve always suspected: that the books we encounter as children are the ones to which we\u2019re most attached. After all, while it\u2019s not inconceivable that one would throw a viewing party for a TV adaptation of the work of a writer discovered in adulthood, it seems more likely to happen with a children\u2019s author. (My flat. 8pm. \u201cArmoured bear\u201d makes a good cold weather costume.) So what\u2019s behind our heightened connection with children\u2019s books? The journalist Lucy Mangan offers some clues in her memoir of childhood reading, Bookworm. She suggests that children\u2019s tendency towards re-reading is not only healthy but necessary, given the wealth of new information books convey. \u201cYou are learning about people, about relationships, about the variety of responses available to them [the characters] and in many more situations and circumstances \u2026 than one single real life permits,\u201d she writes. \u201cEach book is a world entire.\u201d I\u2019d argue, then, that our fondness for children\u2019s books not only comes from the familiarity forged through re-reading but from the reason we re-read, too. As Mangan says, children\u2019s books are where we first encounter myriad aspects of life. Such intense periods of discovery tend to lodge in the memory. There\u2019s also another factor: time. In youth, entire days are spent in uninterrupted stretches of reading. It\u2019s harder when you have a job and WhatsApp. Mangan also notes that higher expectations mean these \u201cdays of effortless immersion\u201d are harder to come by in adulthood. \u201cAs an adult, your tastes (and/or prejudices) are more developed, your time is more precious and your critical faculties are harder to switch off.\u201d Children, on the other hand, are joyously uninhibited when they read \u2013 in other words, they\u2019re not fretting about whether the book will fit with their #personalbrand on Instagram. In addition, author Katherine Rundell has suggested that children\u2019s books work on two levels, simultaneously satisfying kids\u2019 thirst for adventure and incorporating the adult author\u2019s awareness of the knottier aspects of life. Indeed, they\u2019re required to operate on two planes if they\u2019re to avoid boring parents who are reading to their offspring. So, in a way, children\u2019s books work harder than books for adults, conveying many-layered meaning with the sort of lightness required to hold short attention spans. Such finesse doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by readers. All of this is why, when someone inquires about your favourite book and you insist it\u2019s a toss-up between Bernardine Evaristo\u2019s Booker prize-winning Girl, Woman, Other and Virginia Woolf\u2019s To The Lighthouse, they\u2019ll know you\u2019re lying. Neither of these can be your favourite book \u2013 or, at least, the book that has had the greatest influence on you. The books that mark us most profoundly \u2013 that burrow into our psyches and shape how we see the world \u2013 are the ones we read as children. Of course, some sneer that children\u2019s books are rife with nostalgia. But the nostalgia in question isn\u2019t a \u201ctake back control\u201d yearning for a simpler time \u2013 but for a simpler way of seeing. Childhood reading overlaps with a period where the future seems wide open. What we\u2019re looking to resurrect through kids\u2019 books isn\u2019t the past, but this beguilingly cheery perspective. Besides, the great gift of Pullman\u2019s stories set in Lyra\u2019s universe is that they\u2019re part of the present as much as the past. Along with the TV series, anyone who\u2019s been in a bookshop recently will know Pullman is still adding to the series \u2013 The Secret Commonwealth, the second book in The Book of Dust trilogy (which is interlinked with His Dark Materials) was published last month. It revisits Lyra in her 20s. I\u2019ve already read it twice. Perhaps it\u2019s not only childhood that gets lost to literary escapism, after all. Lifelong literary loves Little Women Louisa May Alcott I was addicted to Little Women and the three books that followed it. I adored reading about sensible Meg, Tomboy Jo, ailing Beth and spoilt Amy with her blond ringlets (I envied her those). I am not sure that I identified with any of the Little Women but the narrative escape was as complete as vanishing into another country (Massachusetts, America, to be precise). Nowadays, I think the main reason these books enslaved their readers was to do with Alcott\u2019s virtuoso sentimentality. We are so used to disdaining sentimentality,we forget what a force it can be. Kate Kellaway, Observer writer The Secret Garden Frances Hodgson Burnett My mother gave me Frances Hodgson Burnett\u2019s A Little Princess when I was princess-age, and its story of the suffering of Sara Crewe was once my favourite. But that was because I hadn\u2019t read The Secret Garden yet. Reading it this September, through a depression that was starting to lift, Mary Lennox taming her tantrums in the Yorkshire air and lifting her sadness as the daffodils bloomed felt like the metaphor I needed. Sara Crewe is always good, just tested by circumstances; Mary Lennox is spoiled but learns to be good to herself, and to others. It is a very Victorian rewilding \u2013 the stiff father repents and returns, and love for nature is elided into love for God \u2013 but it gives a girl hope, because it shows that her happiness is in her own hands. Joanna Biggs, writer and assistant editor of the London Review of Books The James Bond novels Ian Fleming I\u2019m envious of children who grew up with The Gruffalo or The Amber Spyglass. My juvenile reading lacked such contemporary wonders. We read what our parents had read. The landscape of the postwar child\u2019s imagination was dominated by Victorian classics (Alice), or Edwardian stalwarts (Swallows &amp; Amazons). For me, reading was about transgression not fantasy. My favourite was the adventures of 007. Casino Royale was published the year I was born, 1953. James Bond is my Harry Potter. Addicted to reading \u2013 the flashlight beneath the bedclothes \u2013 it was Fleming\u2019s thrillers (Dr No, Goldfinger, From Russia with Love) that became the literary drug I look back on with longing, shame and regret. Robert McCrum, writer and associate editor of the Observer The Borrowers Mary Norton I don\u2019t remember when I first read Mary Norton\u2019s The Borrowers. It seems it was always part of my childhood. As with the very best children\u2019s books, it filled my world with magic. In each place we lived I looked for nooks and crannies where our family of Borrowers might live. When small things went missing, I would be convinced it had been \u2018borrowed\u2019, and puzzle at how tiny people might use one plastic Barbie shoe (perhaps a soup bowl?). The Borrowers kept my imagination alight and, in a childhood where I moved frequently and often felt lonely, those tiny creatures became secret friends and I, their beloved, watched over, \u2018human bean\u2019.
