Platt, with only two more friendlies scheduled before the tournament begins, was delighted that his squad gained invaluable experience in a game watched by only 350 people, with the bonus that they extended his undefeated record - six wins, one draw - as coach of the Under-21s. \"Once we qualified [for Switzerland] I wanted to make sure that we had an away game against an eastern European side, and for me it was a good exercise,\" Platt said later. \"That's part of their development. If you're going to go on and play at senior level you're going to be coming to places like this needing to get points. \"You're going to go to places like Turkey and Poland where they put you in very working- class cities, not the best hotels, and play the game where there's going to be a very partisan crowd. They don't look after you in the manner that you're looked after back in England, and you're better off learning that at this level.\" Shola Ameobi got the goal in the second half with a tap-in after Malcolm Christie had wormed his way into the area and crossed. Ameobi, the 20-year-old Newcastle striker, had been on the field only four minutes and in that time had rattled a post from 25 yards. Slovenia played with 10 men for 51 minutes after Matjaz Lunder was sent off for tripping Jermain Defoe, who had tested him for pace, and England were mostly in control thereafter, though six minutes from time Nicky Weaver did well to tip awaya long-range effort from Dejan Robnik. \"It's only a friendly, but had that been a qualifying game and one of those goes in from 30 yards you draw 1-1 and only go away with a point when you know that you're considerably better,\" Platt said. The coach used all 16 of his players but lost Christie near the end when he hobbled off, though the injury is not thought to be serious. Newcastle's Jermaine Jenas, who played his first game for Nottingham Forest when Platt was manager there, and Charlton's Paul Konchesky were given debuts and Spurs' Matthew Etherington and Fulham's Zat Knight also won first caps as second-half substitutes. Slovenia, whose players looked keen to force their way into the World Cup squad, took the game to the visitors before half-time with their midfielders Mitja Hojnik, Janez Zavrl and Dominik Bersnjak linking confidently, although their best chance came when Gareth Barry's looping back-pass sailed over Paul Robinson's head but bounced over the bar. - PA Slovenia: Fornezzi; Lunder, Radovac (Andelkovic, 90min), Dedic, Krsic (Elsner, 70), Cesar, Hojnik (Vodeb, 59), Zavrl (Doncec, 70), Bersnjak (Stromajer, 70), Plastovski (Robnik, 55), Plazniki.
