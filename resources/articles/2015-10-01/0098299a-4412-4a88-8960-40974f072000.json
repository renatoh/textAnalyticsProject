Contrasting her party\u2019s disciplined stance with Labour\u2019s chaotic position on the issue, the SNP leader will warn on Saturday that British airstrikes will only add to the \u201calready unimaginable human suffering\u201d in the region, rather than help to swiftly bring it to an end. The SNP strategy was endorsed overwhelmingly by the party\u2019s national conference in Aberdeen on Friday, after former leader Alex Salmond said military intervention would be futile and would add Syria to a long list of British military failures, including in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. The party leadership expect David Cameron\u2019s government to push for a Commons vote to formally authorise RAF airstrikes in Syria, with Tory backbenchers complaining about a lack of action while France, US and Russia are now attacking. In her closing speech to the conference, Sturgeon will claim that a vague notion that something needs to be done, without any clear evidence that added airstrikes can solve the crisis, is wholly inadequate. She will ask: \u201cThis question has not been answered \u2013 when airstrikes by US, Russian, Arab, Turkish and French forces have not brought this multi-layered conflict closer to a resolution, what possible grounds are there for believing that adding UK airstrikes will do so?\u201d A \u201crenewed and intensive diplomatic initiative, led by the UN\u201d would be the best long-term solution, she will say. The Tory majority will push through any vote on Syria backed by Cameron, but SNP strategists believe that a united stance by their 55 MPs in the Commons will highlight Corbyn\u2019s inability to unite Labour on the issue, weakening his authority in parliament and among leftwing voters. It comes as the SNP is preparing to fight a Scottish parliamentary election that Sturgeon hopes to win with another landslide. While Corbyn is instinctively opposed to UK intervention, his shadow foreign secretary, Hillary Benn, and many on the Blairite wing of the party support it. . Salmond told the conference \u2013 the party\u2019s largest after its membership quadrupled following last year\u2019s independence referendum \u2013 that Labour\u2019s divisions left it to the SNP to be the voice of \u201cclarity, sanity and humanity\u201d on Syria. Characterising the Tory position as settling scores after Labour defeated Cameron on Syria in 2013, and Labour\u2019s as woefully confused, Salmond added to loud applause: \u201cThe should be no more futile military interventions by the UK. No more Afghanistans with no exit strategy, no more Libyas where we spent 13 times as much bombing as we did reconstructing that country, and no more illegal wars such as the one in Iraq.\u201d Senior SNP figures have told the Guardian that the party\u2019s firm stance on Syria will also build up its standing among centre-left English voters. They are keen to counter suspicions that the SNP\u2019s sole motivation is to cause conflict with Westminster as they pursue a second referendum. The party\u2019s ongoing quest to completely replace Labour as Scotland\u2019s dominant party of the centre-left will continue on Saturday when the general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, Grahame Smith, will give the first ever speech by an STUC leader to an SNP conference. In a clear sign of Labour\u2019s waning influence among trade unionists in Scotland, Smith will welcome Sturgeon\u2019s promise to oppose the UK government\u2019s trade union reform bill but will also gently urge Sturgeon to use her government\u2019s legal powers to block the legislation where it affects Holyrood\u2019s policymaking areas. But it then emerged that the SNP is to ignore any appeals to join other UK parties or party leaders \u2013 including Labour \u2013 in the official cross-party campaign to stay in the European Union at the forthcoming referendum. It will instead set up its own autonomous yes campaign on Europe. Its senior figures want to minimise any risks to the SNP\u2019s reputation from sharing platforms with a divided Labour party or the Tories, and ensure it keeps complete control over its agenda on the EU. SNP leaders also acknowledge that the party has a deeply Europhobic section of its membership; many older nationalists believe Scotland cannot be truly independent inside the EU. Humza Yousaf, the Scottish government\u2019s minister for Europe, said the SNP wanted to run its own campaign to ensure it was positive and grassroots-led. Referring to the nickname given to the pro-union Better Together campaign during last year\u2019s Scottish independence referendum, Yousaf told the SNP conference in Aberdeen: \u201cI\u2019ve got no interest in being part of project fear mark two. \u201cLet\u2019s make it clear that the SNP will not join the campaign club with the Tories. We will not stand shoulder to shoulder as Scottish Labour did with the heartless Conservatives. And we will not join with a divided Labour party, who don\u2019t have a unified position on Europe, who do more flip-flops than the proverbial Olympic gymnast. \u201cWe will have our own campaign, an SNP campaign for a positive, reformed Europe. Our yes campaign will not just be positive, it will be grassroots, it will be upbeat and it will offer a better, reformed, greener, fairer and a more socially liberal EU that works for the betterment of the many and not the few.\u201d Sturgeon and John Swinney, her deputy first minister at Holyrood, peppered their speeches with new policy and spending pledges. Swinney said Scottish councils would soon be able to cut local business rates to stimulate investment. Having already announced plans to build 50,000 new homes if the SNP win next May\u2019s Scottish elections, Sturgeon is expected to tell delegates on Saturday the party will spend \u00a3200m over the next five years to greatly increase specialist knee, hip and cataract operations for elderly people at five new centres."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
