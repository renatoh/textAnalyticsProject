I stand much closer to the world, although you seem to take most of the light, and lean back on the bed, one leg tucked up, one hand reaching to pet the cat. 'The world at large' is what I mean. On your side a trace of musk or ambergris, on mine whisky and the sting of turpentine, as if we had marked our ground, as if we had staked a claim, you to play the odalisque, me to set a stain on your linen, then up and turn my back and work till dawn. You tell me your dreams are bad; I say the same. It's as if we could still be here in thirty years with more possessions but fewer needs, your name on the very tip of my tongue, and mine on yours. A hunter's moon hangs in the bathroom steam. Tell me where you learned that a daily soak in that scald was more than halfway to a cure for whatever might ail you - some compendium on Health and Welfare for the Modern Woman? Was it a footnote in that same vade mecum that encouraged you to seek comfort in darkness, so you rise from the bath and draw the shadows to your shoulders like a cloak? Come back to bed: there's more to be done to this double portrait, double take. Man and Wife, Nude; or man and wife in the raw. XXIV Full-length in the bath, you are wasp- waisted, long-legged, high-breasted: you are just as you were. The water is skimmed with sunlight from the cusp of your feet to the wide weed of your hair. It's best for me if I'm standing on a chair, back a bit and off to the side: where I always stand, in fact, to get you right, to watch you pour those syrups and crystals, to watch the colours blend, to watch you wallow as if it were kill or cure. Which could, you want to tell me, be the case. The sun dips under the sill; a fragile gloss peels off the bathroom tiles and the water greens. You slip below the surface with open eyes. Don't you know that total immersion will soften your bones? Don't you know what it signifies to fold your arms across your breasts like that? It must be cold so far down, and dark. Can you hear the drone of deep-sea psalmody, or feel the tides? Come up from the salt and I'll give you back the sun flourish by flourish, just as it was, green into gold."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
