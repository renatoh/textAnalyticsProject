What I can say is we have had the lead in so many games and we haven\u2019t been able to win; six or seven times we\u2019ve been 1-0 up, or 2-1 or 3-2. We should be better at seeing those games into wins.\u201d Since he was made permanent manager in late March United have won six out of 22 matches. Asked what evidence there is that this form can be arrested, Solskj\u00e6r was defiant. \u201cI think there\u2019s loads of evidence these boys are closer to winning games than losing games,\u201d he said. \u201cTo tip margins in our favour we\u2019ve got to work on different things. The first half wasn\u2019t good enough. I am disappointed in that because all the [regularly selected] boys stayed here, while the young boys went over to Kazakhstan [last week to play Astana]. \u201cWe didn\u2019t go out together [against Villa] as a team. We should have done better. These boys will learn and improve. Sometimes inconsistency will happen with young boys. We have to become a better unit. Aston Villa had too many counterattacks for my liking.\u201d United fell behind to an 11th-minute Jack Grealish opener before Marcus Rashford equalised just before the interval. While Victor Lindel\u00f6f put the home side ahead on 64 minutes, Tyrone Mings equalised within 120 seconds. With the score at 1-1 Grealish missed a clear chance to put Villa ahead. The Villa manager, Dean Smith, said: \u201cHe knows more than anybody that nine times out of 10 he scores that. He\u2019ll be pleased because of his goal but he won\u2019t sleep because of that miss.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
