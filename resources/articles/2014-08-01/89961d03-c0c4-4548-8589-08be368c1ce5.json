Since finishing third behind Manchester City and Liverpool last season two club stalwarts, Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole, have joined the Brazil defender David Luiz in leaving Stamford Bridge, while Chelsea have spent more than \u00a375m on Cesc F\u00e1bregas, Diego Costa and Filipe Lu\u00eds and also brought Didier Drogba back to London for a second spell. Now Mourinho believes he has everything he needs to mount a serious challenge on all fronts. \u201cWe have the squad that we want to have,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a squad for tomorrow, for next season and also a squad with big possibilities for the next five or 10 years with so many young people. So I like my squad very much. \u201cI love the club because the club was fantastic and gave me the three targets I was asking for, in the left-back, a midfield player and a striker. In fact they gave me two strikers because Didier is also back. \u201cWe have bought three people in Filipe, Diego and F\u00e1bregas, all in the best stage for a football player \u2013 between 25 and 30. They are three experienced players with the quality to strengthen immediately our team.\u201d Chelsea begin their new campaign on Monday night with a trip to newly promoted Burnley. Three losses to Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and Sunderland \u2013 who put paid to Mourinho\u2019s record of 77 Premier League home games without defeat \u2013 virtually ended their hopes of regaining the league title in the Portuguese\u2019s first season back at Stamford Bridge. However, the manager has warned that his players have learned from that experience and expects them to make amends this time. \u201cThe squad improves, for sure, and the team can show qualities on the pitch that in the past we didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cBut obviously this is the Premier League and every team tries to be better, especially at the top. Are we ready for that? Yes, we are but this is England. \u201cIn other countries the title race is between two teams and sometimes only one. Here it is between five or six.\u201d Meanwhile, Everton have confirmed the signing of Ghana winger Christian Atsu on a season-long loan from Chelsea."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
