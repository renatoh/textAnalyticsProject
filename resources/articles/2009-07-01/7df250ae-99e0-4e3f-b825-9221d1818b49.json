The Confederation of British Industry warned that unemployment would rise to more than 3m by next summer unless action was taken now. The organisation is proposing an Alternative to Redundancy (ATR) scheme, giving the employer the option of placing an employee on the scheme for up to six months instead of making them redundant. The employee would not work during that time, but would be paid twice the rate of job seekers' allowance \u2013 half by the government and half by the employer. The CBI, which pitched the idea to the government last week, believes it would help firms to retain skills during a short and sharp fall in demand and give workers greater security of returning to work. John Cridland, CBI deputy director-general, said: \"We considered various forms of wage subsidy and short-time working, but this approach is better.\" The scheme would allow the firm to take the employee back into work when the ATR period expires or earlier, if business improves. If demand fails to pick up, full redundancy rights are preserved, including the six months of ATR service. \"This is not about businesses ducking their redundancy responsibility. In fact if a scheme runs for six months and a redundancy is still made then the business will end up paying more,\" Cridland said. However, the Trades Union Congress is sceptical. Brendan Barber, the TUC general secretary, said: \"It is better to keep people in work and training with their employer even if on short-term working, rather than sitting at home, which is why unions and other employer groups are campaigning for the kind of wage subsidies that are now common in the rest of Europe.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
