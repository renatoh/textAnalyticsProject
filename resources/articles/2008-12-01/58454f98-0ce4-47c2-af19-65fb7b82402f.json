She overhauled pre-race favourite Katie Hoff of the US in the closing stages of the 400m freestyle then won a second gold in the 800m freestyle, breaking a world record that had stood for 19 years to become Britain's most successful swimmer in 100 years. Ben Ainslie Ben Ainslie has dominated Olympic sailing for nearly a decade and won a third consecutive Olympic gold in Qingdao this summer. Ainslie's victory in the Finn class made him the most successful British Olympic sailor in history \u2014 IOC chief Jacques Rogge likened his achievements to those of multi-medallists Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt. Joe Calzaghe The reigning BBC Sports Personality of the Year cemented his place in boxing history with victories over Americans Bernard Hopkins and Roy Jones Jr. The Pride of Wales stepped up to light heavyweight to fight Hopkins and Jones Jr, and then beat both of them in their own backyard. His unbeaten record now stands at 46-0. Nicole Cooke Cooke started the gold rush in Beijing for Britain's cyclists, winning the Olympic road race with a perfectly timed finish. In September, she was crowned world champion in Varese, creating history by becoming the first cyclist, male or female, to win road racing's top two prizes in the same year. Lewis Hamilton In the final race of the formula one championship in Brazil, Hamilton provided one of the most exciting finales to a championship in motor sport history, leaving it to the final lap before securing the fifth place he needed to become the youngest ever driver to win the world title. Chris Hoy The Scottish cyclist won three cycling golds in the Laoshan Velodrome in Beijing, in the team sprint, sprint and keirin. He was the first Briton to win three golds at a single Games since swimmer Henry Taylor in 1908, and is now the most successful male Olympic cyclist of all time. Andy Murray The Scot finally began to come of age this year. The 21-year-old beat world No1 Rafael Nadal on his way to the final of the US Open, and took his number of career singles titles to eight with five tournament wins, including victories at Masters Series events in Cincinnati and Madrid to cement his ranking this year at a career high No4. Christine Ohuruogu In front of 91,000 people in the Bird's Nest stadium in Beijing, the reigning world champion timed her run to perfection to overhaul America's pre-race favourite Sanya Richards and Jamaica's Shericka Williams on the home straight to claim Great Britain's only athletics gold of the Games in the Olympic 400m final. Rebecca Romero Rebecca Romero continued Britain's cycling domination in Beijing when she beat compatriot Wendy Houvenaghel to win individual pursuit gold. The 28-year-old's victory was made all the more remarkable because in Athens four years ago she won a silver medal in rowing. She is only the second woman to win a medal in two different sports at a Summer Games. Bradley Wiggins Pursuit expert Bradley Wiggins, 28, took his overall Olympic medal tally to six with two golds in the Laoshan Velodrome, in the individual and team pursuit. In winning the individual pursuit, Bradley became the first rider to successfully defend an Olympic pursuit title. His second gold came in the team pursuit in a new world-record time for the British team."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
