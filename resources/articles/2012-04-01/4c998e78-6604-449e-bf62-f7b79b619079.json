But that's the past. We believe, with the team we have, we can beat them.\" No one has explicitly mentioned the word \"revenge\" yet, but Chelsea's motivation is implicit. It is a little under three years since Iniesta emerged from a frenzied contest, made infamous by Tom Henning Ovrebo's erratic refereeing performance, to thrash in a stoppage-time equaliser for the visitors' 10 men and secure progress to the final in Rome. A fourth penalty appeal from the home side was turned down by the Norwegian in what little time remained after the critical away goal and before the tie ended in anarchy, with Michael Ballack confronting the officials and Didier Drogba screaming obscenities into a television camera. The mood was so embittered because Chelsea, then under the temporary stewardship of Guus Hiddink, recognised a glorious opportunity had been snatched from their grasp. Given the relative toils endured in this competition in the years since, their sense of grievance has festered. It is tempting now, ahead of a rematch against the Catalan club, to wonder what might have been had Chelsea followed up their whirlwind start that evening to reach the Stadio Olimpico and a second successive final against Manchester United. Would Sir Alex Ferguson's side have been defeated and Roman Abramovich's thirst quenched in this competition at last? If so, would the European Cup have allowed the hierarchy to part with long-serving players on a high, and seen the club progress in a more systematic manner? And would Hiddink's permanent successor, Carlo Ancelotti, have been granted proper time to instigate a revamp of this squad rather than being sacked after his first trophyless season? As it is, the current interim first-team coach Roberto Di Matteo is effectively papering over cracks that have been allowed to gape ever wider in the period since, with another summer of upheaval lying ahead. There has been too much disruption off the pitch and short-termism on it over the last three years. Bar\u00e7a have claimed two European Cups since that fateful night. Chelsea have gone through three managers, are currently searching for a fourth, and have seen their reputation at this level steadily eroded as players' powers inevitably fade. Ancelotti, a Champions League specialist, had been appointed in the summer of 2009 to secure the trophy for the first time in the club's history, an ambition that felt realistic at the time but proved horribly optimistic. Under the Italian, Chelsea never even reached the last four. Twelve of the 18 players involved in Hiddink's match-day squad for that infamous second leg remain at the club and are fired by hopes of making amends, even if this campaign surely represents an unexpected if final opportunity for most to make history. This generation's time must come now or never. The task ahead is daunting in the extreme: to suffocate and overcome the slickest club side in world football. Logic suggests their chances of success are slim. Benfica, with 10 men, had threatened on Wednesday to prevail at Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea are usually at their most impressive. But recognition that this could be a last chance will serve to fix focus, even amid a cluttered schedule, and may ensure the semi-final tie is far tighter than common sense demands it should be. These are the kind of weighty occasions to remind elder statesmen of the powers of their youth. \"Two months back I'd have bitten your hand off to be where we are now,\" said the captain John Terry, reflecting just how unlikely even getting this far feels within the setup after an underwhelming campaign. \"Those meetings with Barcelona have been some of my proudest memories as a Chelsea player. When they come here, especially, I feel we've shown we can take it to them a little bit. Not many teams have really done that to them. \"We realise it's going to be tough, but we're a good side, too. We've shown over the last month that we're a match for anyone. If we can be as solid as we have been in the last few games in the Champions League, well, who knows?\" Kalou pointed to playing against teams who \"you play and they always win\", though the irony is that Chelsea have not lost any of their last five meetings with Barcelona, dating back to the Jos\u00e9 Mourinho era. \"People will look at the way Barcelona play and say: 'Chelsea have no chance,'\" the Ivorian added. \"But we learn from the past. We believe we can pull through.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
