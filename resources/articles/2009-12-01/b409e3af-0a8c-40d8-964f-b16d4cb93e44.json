There may be oodles of (rather clumsy) flying, but even so Julian Ronnie, Paul Miller and David Taylor's musical version of JM Barrie's story about the boy who didn't want to grow up remains resolutely earthbound. Indeed, there are times during these two long hours when the production seems to be suffering from some kind of theatrical arrested development all of its own. It's very sparkly, the Darling nursery is a tangerine dream, Neverland is full of Enid Blyton-style toadstools and Nana the dog is simply a canine version of the pantomime cow. You half expect Bonnie Langford to appear slapping her thigh. Actually, I found myself longing for Bonnie to appear slapping her thigh. This is very much the reduced Peter Pan, untroubling, jolly, perilously sweet and entirely untouched by the original's disturbing sense of loss and grief, the tragedy of growing old and the even greater tragedy of remaining for ever a child. The result is an evening that is bright and shiny but rather charmless, and so defaults to romping comic mode. The pirates are fun, particularly the gobbledegook-speaking Mad Pete (Matthew Gould), and there is a fine clutch of Lost Boys with Nicholas Pack touching and funny as Tootles. But the songs add little and often detract from the action. Siobhan McCarthy, who also plays Mrs Darling, gets the only really entertaining song when doubling as Ethel the Mermaid, an underwater nightclub singer, who in a witty ditty inquires: Where Have All the Mermen Gone? Elsewhere, there are just too many soppy ballads that no amount of lush orchestration can enliven, including one sickly number that substitutes for the original play's inspired device that has the audience save the dying Tinkerbell by saying that they believe in fairies. Faced with such material, it's not surprising that many of the cast struggle. Spencer Charles Noll's unappealing Peter is curiously unanimated and lacks vulnerability, and Lauren Samuels' Wendy is earnest and perpetually puzzled \u2013 as if wondering why her agent ever put her up for the job. With better material they may well shine, but I suspect that everyone involved knows that this production is a Christmas turkey that is never going to take flight. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 December 2009. In the original Wendy was said to be played by Holly James. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
