Savill said: \"We currently have two governing bodies - the BHB and the Jockey Club - whereas all other sports and racing jurisdictions have just one. In order to modernise our structure, we need to merge the governance and regulatory responsibilities of the two bodies into one. \"That is not to say that the BHB will take over regulation. The regulatory function needs to operate independently, even if under the same umbrella. What we need is a simplification, rationalisation and modernisation of our structure in order that we can operate more effectively. \"How this is managed will be a matter for considerable discussion between the BHB and the Jockey Club over the next few months. \"Jockey Club chief steward Christopher Spence and I have already talked about the principles of a way forward, but it is too early to be talking specifics. What we agreed is that the most troublesome area is the security function. \"We have therefore decided to have a joint BHB/Jockey Club review of this area which will begin immediately. We would hope to produce a report by early next year.\" Saville acknowledged that the sport's public image had been damaged by the Panorama programme and that it was an embarrassment to racing, and in particular the Jockey Club. However, he described the BBC programme as \"neither fair, nor balanced in its portrayal,\" tempering that observation with \"Panorama made a good case that more vigour needs to be shown to stamp out questionable practises.\" He endorsed Phipps's resignation: \"He made some serious errors of judgment and had no choice. He should have done so the day he was interviewed by Panorama.\" Savill is presently chairing the Racing Review Committee, and he added that the recommendations that may emerge from it would be the same as if Panorama had not taken place. He expected the committee to produce a report by March or April next year and a restructuring plan to take about 18 months. \"That will take place almost certainly after I have ceased to be chairman of the BHB, if anyone thinks this is a power grab by me,\" he said. \"I hope that I am not giving the impression that there are not some very capable people within the Jockey Club. There is a wealth of knowledge and experience among them. \"There has been the feeling that the Jockey Club has to become more democratic, more professional, more open, and the merger idea is just an extension of the process.\" Savill intriguingly hinted that the government might be approached to ensure that the police and racing security became much more involved. He said: \"In France, their Jockey Club does not have a security department, they have a special police department which is responsible for all matters relating to racing and betting.\" Back on the subject of the Panorama programme, Savill said: \"It left the casual viewer believing that racing is riddled with corruption, when the truth is that it is by and large clean.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
