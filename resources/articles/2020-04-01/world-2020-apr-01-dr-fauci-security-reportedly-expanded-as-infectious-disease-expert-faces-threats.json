While Fauci\u2019s straight talk and willingness to gently correct the president\u2019s outrageous exaggerations have drawn admiration from late-night talkshow hosts, professional basketball players and doughnut shop owners alike, the doctor has received threats and unwelcome communications from both critics and fervent admirers. The Washington Post first reported the news. At a coronavirus taskforce briefing at the White House on Wednesday, Fauci declined to comment on whether he was receiving security protection, deferring to the health department\u2019s inspector general. Trump interjected, saying that Fauci \u201cdoesn\u2019t need security, everybody loves him\u201d. If anyone were to attack Fauci, Trump added, \u201cthey\u2019d be in big trouble\u201d, touting the disease expert\u2019s high school athletic career. \u201cHe was a great basketball player, did anybody know that?\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe was a little on the short side for the NBA but he was talented.\u201d As basketball captain at Regis high school in 1958, Fauci had helped lead the team to an unlikely victory. Asked to comment on any increase in Fauci\u2019s security detail, Tesia Williams, a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) spokeswoman, said: \u201cFor more than two decades, the office of inspector general has provided professional protective services for the HHS secretary and, as needed, to departmental leadership. In each case, OIG assesses and recommends the appropriate level of protection. I cannot confirm, at this time, that we are providing such services for Dr Fauci.\u201d The immunologist has become an unlikely celebrity, representing the US scientific community facing off against the coronavirus pandemic. The NBA star Stephen Curry has called him \u201cthe Goat\u201d \u2013 greatest of all time. Fans have plastered his likeness on cupcakes, doughnuts, socks and prayer candles. But Fauci has also become a public target for rightwing pundits and bloggers who believe he is undermining the president. An article in the rightwing outlet American Thinker called Fauci a \u201cDeep-State Hillary Clinton-loving stooge\u201d, and referred to a seven-year-old email in which he praised Clinton for her stamina through the Benghazi hearings. Tom Fitton, the president of the conservative group Judicial Watch, a conservative group; and Bill Mitchell, host of the far-right online talkshow YourVoice America, have also reinforced Fauci criticisms and conspiracy theories."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
