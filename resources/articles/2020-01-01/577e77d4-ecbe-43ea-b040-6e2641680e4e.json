United\u2019s \u2018Barmy Army\u2019 have carved out a reputation for creating an adverse environment. Earps loves it, and is one of the few goalkeepers to have her own song. \u201cWhen my family came [the Barmy Army] gave them a song sheet and they were very impressed it was in squad order,\u201d she says. Told there is a PDF too, she quips: \u201cIs there an ebook coming out?\u201d \u201cI assure you that if it goes to penalties the Barmy Army will be behind my goal,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey will move if they have to. \u201cWhen you are playing at home you want a loud atmosphere and that is where we are getting to in the women\u2019s game now. In prior seasons it didn\u2019t really feel different if you were home or away. But I think the noisier and more fiery it is, the more fun it is. \u201cI buzz off it personally and I think it is intimidating for the opposition to come to. I don\u2019t want to say the more hostile the better but the louder the better because it really gives you a buzz on the pitch and gets you through tough moments.\u201d With a bigger profile and more fans comes the need for a much thicker skin. \u201cYou always play your best football on the sofa,\u201d the 26-year-old Earps says. \u201cI\u2019m the same. I watch a game and: \u2018Why did this person do this?\u2019 \u201cLots of people have opinions now, the game is growing and there are more people on social media, more media in general and you have to have a thick skin to deal with every man and a dog telling you how to save the ball in that moment. I can assure you that in every situation I\u2019m very much trying.\u201d In women\u2019s football it has been harder for goalkeepers because whereas the game has grown, goalkeeping coaching has lagged behind. It is finally catching up, though. \u201cThere are more trained coaches now,\u201d Earps says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a goalkeeper coach full-time until I was 18 or 19, which now sounds completely ludicrous. It can still improve but it is so much better. I would train two, three, four times a week. In Sunday League my dad would just throw the ball to me, or one of the players would warm me up before a game, which seems completely ridiculous.\u201d Instead goalkeepers were left to do their own research and Earps turns goalkeeper encyclopedia when asked who she admires. \u201cI\u2019ve watched so many. Manuel Neuer, Ter Stegen, Joe Hart, Casillas, Reina, Hope Solo, Alisson, Ederson, Buffon. So, so many, all with completely different strengths. \u201cWhen I was growing up I loved the shot-stopping of Joe Hart, the way Casillas dealt with one-v-one battles, and Pepe Reina\u2019s side-volley was insane. Manuel Neuer all-round. Now it is probably Ter Stegen.\u201d If her heroes were mostly men, Earps is now part of a generation providing role models for the next layer of aspiring keepers. \u201cBefore I spoke to just young girls. Now I see a lot of young boys saying: \u2018I\u2019m a goalkeeper.\u2019 I always like speaking to them as I think it is the best position and most important,\u201d she says. \u201cI like having that interaction with the kids because it\u2019s not easy: it is split-second decision-making; it is heavily criticised. Especially as a kid that can be intimidating. Your peers are saying: \u2018Why didn\u2019t you save that?\u2019 and you are trying. \u201cI don\u2019t think social media helps that when it broadcasts good or bad things that goalkeepers do. Eight-year-old kids feel they have to live up to a standard of Buffon, who is 41 and nobody knows how he\u2019s still going. Maybe it is more open about the struggles of the position but I\u2019m always encouraging of people wanting to be a goalkeeper because it is a wicked position.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
