But assuming the trench warfare eventually relents, Rob Howley\u2019s team will find themselves with a scarcely deserved opportunity to stumble into the record books. No Welsh side has ever managed three wins from their autumn internationals in Cardiff and after Sam Davies\u2019s last-gasp drop goal spared their blushes against Japan, the defence coach, Shaun Edwards, was quick to drum that into his players. The highlights of their autumn so far would not make for comfortable viewing \u2013 shredded by Australia before squeezing past Argentina and Japan but lacking in confidence, composure and any real attacking intent. Comparatively, Japan mesmerised with handling skills that took the breath away \u2013 their back three of Kotaro Matsushima, Akihito Yamada and Kenki Fukuoka were quite wonderful. And but for one missed penalty from the otherwise excellent Yu Tamura at fly\u2011half, another giant-killing beckoned on British soil. \u201cWe\u2019re licking our wounds to be honest, we were too loose at times and we got punished,\u201d said Dan Lydiate, who scored his first try in 62 international Tests. \u201cIf we do that next week it\u2019s not going to be a pretty scoreline so we\u2019ll look at the video and hopefully tighten things up.\u201d South Africa recovered from defeat by Japan to finish third at the World Cup \u2013 edging out Wales in the quarter-final \u2013 but 12 months before that, Wales claimed a largely forgettable 12-6 win in a rare victory against one of the southern hemisphere\u2019s big three. And it appears the Springboks, wounded by a first defeat by Italy on Saturday and facing a first winless autumn tour of Europe since 2002, will again determine what note Wales finish the year on. \u201cThey\u2019ll certainly be wanting to finish their autumn internationals on a high and there will certainly be a backlash coming,\u201d Lydiate added. \u201cHopefully we can up our game from this week; we need to step up. \u201cThey are one of the most physical teams in world rugby and if you don\u2019t stop them it\u2019s going to be a tough day at the office and a high scoreline. It\u2019s going to be a tough challenge. They\u2019re not a poor team by any means. In recent years we\u2019ve come short, in 2014 we got a win over them but if we can the win over them next week, three out of four is not too bad for an autumn series.\u201d Despite falling behind 6-0 and losing Liam Williams to the sin-bin inside the first 10 minutes, Wales\u2019s response suggested a tough afternoon for Japan. The home side had dominance up front but while Jamie Roberts followed Lydiate over in the first half, Wales could not turn the screw. As was the case against Argentina, whenever Wales put points on the board \u2013 Sam Warburton was next over the try line \u2013 Japan hit back almost immediately, eventually levelling at 30-30 before Davies\u2019s intervention. Howley will make changes for South Africa and Taulupe Faletau comes into contention after playing the best part of an hour for Bath on Friday while Dan Biggar and George North will surely return for Gareth Anscombe and Alex Cuthbert. Warburton is expecting the Springboks to bring \u201cthe kitchen sink\u201d but Wales, lambasted by the England coach Eddie Jones for their performance against his former side, are under equal amounts of pressure. \u201cSouth Africa are coming back here and the last time they played here was a loss and that will give players confidence,\u201d Howley said. \u201cWe\u2019ve won two from three and [it comes down to] next week\u2019s performance \u2013 it\u2019s either a really good autumn series or we\u2019ve come up short and that focuses the mind for next week\u2019s performance.\u201d Wales L Williams; Halfpenny, J Davies, Roberts, Cuthbert; Anscombe (S Davies, 66), Lloyd Williams (G Davies, 51); Smith (Gill, 66), Baldwin, Lee (Andrews, 66), Hill (Ball, 62), Jones, Lydiate, Warburton (capt), King.
