Can we all calm down about cyberwar with North Korea already?", "bodyText": "The sanest thing anyone said in Washington this week was a reminder, on the Friday before Christmas, when Barack Obama took a break from oscillating between reassuring rationality and understated fear to make an accidental joke: It says something about North Korea that it decided to mount an all-out attack about a satirical movie \u2026 starring Seth Rogen. It also says something about the over-the-top rhetoric of United States cybersecurity paranoia that it took the President of the United States to remind us to take a deep breath and exhale, even if Sony abruptly scrapped its poorly reviewed Hollywood blockbuster after nebulous threats from alleged North Korean hackers. Unfortunately, acting rational seems out of the question at this point. In between making a lot of sense about Sony\u2019s cowardly \u201cmistake\u201d to pull a film based on a childish, unsubstantiated threat, Obama indicated the US planned to respond in some as-yet-unknown way, which sounds a lot like a cyberattack of our own. \u201cWe will respond, we will respond proportionally, and in a place and time that we choose,\u201d Obama said at his year-end news conference. Why should we be responding offensively at all? As the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Danny Yadron reported, a movie studio doesn\u2019t reach the US government\u2019s definition of \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d that would allow its military to respond under existing rules, but that didn\u2019t stop the White House from calling the Sony hack a \u201cnational security issue\u201d just a day later. Let\u2019s put aside for a moment that many security experts haven\u2019t exactly been rushing to agree with the FBI\u2019s cut-and-dry conclusion that \u201cthe North Korean government is responsible\u201d for the hack. Wired\u2019s Kim Zetter wrote a detailed analysis about why the evidence accusing North Korea is really flimsy, while other security professionals have weighed in with similar research. But whoever the hackers are, can we stop calling them \u201ccyber-terrorists,\u201d like Motion Picture Association of America chairman Chris Dodd did on Friday? They may be sadistic pranksters, extortionists and assholes, but anonymously posting a juvenile and vague word jumble incorporating \u201c9/11\u201d that has no connection to reality does not make them terrorist masterminds. That\u2019s giving whoever did it way too much credit. The rhetoric surrounding Sony\u2019s entirely voluntary decision to cancel a shitty movie based on a barely legible \u201cthreat\u201d has been quite amazing, even for a US Congress that only does one thing well: hyperbole. John McCain, for example, called the Sony hack an \u201cact of war\u201d on Friday \u2013 and that was before he called cancelling the movie \u201cthe greatest blow to free speech that I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime probably\u201d. Really? As security expert Peter Singer explained earlier this week, \u201chaving your scripts posted online does not constitute a terrorist act\u201d. He continued: We\u2019re not going to war with North Korea ... just because Angelina Jolie is now mad at a Sony executive. Acts of war have a different standard. We need to infuse that kind of reality back into a farcical episode that, if it were actually a movie pitch, even Seth Rogen couldn\u2019t get financed. But judging by the hysterical reaction so far, that might be too much to ask. Some of the very politicians vacillating between war-mongering and freedom-of-speechifying have wanted to pass ambiguous \u201ccybersecurity\u201d bills in the past that do hardly anything to increase any single company\u2019s defenses and would have done nothing to stop the Sony attack. But what this kind of legislation would do is promote \u201cinformation-sharing\u201d \u2013 a euphemism for cutting a giant hole in our privacy laws that allow companies like Sony or 20th Century Fox (or Google or Facebook) to hand over all sorts of our personal information to the government with no legal process whatsoever. Obama himself, who threatened to veto a similar bill on privacy grounds last year, is now calling for an \u201cinfo-sharing\u201d bill to be passed quickly next year. McCain has his own bill, as do many others, and you can bet that the new, Republican-controlled Congress capitalize on this all-out fear to try to lose any sort of minimal privacy protective features that may have been required for passage before. Lost in all of the cyber-Armageddon rhetoric is Sony\u2019s own negligent security practices, which is maybe where some of Hollywood\u2019s own overwrought ire should be pointed, rather than blaming journalists for reporting. For a giant corporation that\u2019s been hacked multiple times before (and has even planted malware on its customers devices), Sony had embarrassingly awful security practices, which former employees called \u201ca complete joke\u201d. It\u2019s why multiple former employees are suing Sony for mismanaging sensitive and personal information. This is also critical moment to take another look at the FBI\u2019s proposal to force tech companies to install an insecure backdoor in all communications systems that use encryption, and the NSA\u2019s own aggressive hacking of companies and governments overseas \u2013 both policies that would make attacks like the Sony hack more likely in the future. Shouldn\u2019t we be asking why America is purposefully degrading its own cybersecurity in an attempt to make sure we keep our vast surveillance capabilities on everyone else in the world? In the meantime, calm down about the Sony hack. All-out cyberwar should not be our first reaction when, in reality, outrage over this episode shouldn\u2019t reach higher than the level of watching Team America: World Police in protest on Netflix over the holidays."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
