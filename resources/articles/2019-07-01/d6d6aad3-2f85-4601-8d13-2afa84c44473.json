She sniggers with her colleague as she passes on my request \u2013 to speak to an expert on male circumcision \u2013 before informing me they don\u2019t have one. This foreskin flippancy festers into revulsion in some areas of popular culture. In one Sex and the City episode, Charlotte is so repelled by her lover\u2019s foreskin, she likens it to a \u201cshar-pei\u201d, the analogy cementing Miranda\u2019s resolve to circumcise her kids. It\u2019s written for entertainment value, but for Adam Zeldis, a 36-year-old software developer from New York, it\u2019s no laughing matter. Many men circumcised as babies \u201chave an epiphany when the cultural blinders come off\u201d, he tells the Guardian. \u201cI was a vulnerable 16-year-old when I realised how much skin was removed and that my bodily autonomy was violated.\u201d Georganne Chapin, who runs Intact America, hears about foreskin degradation often. \u201cMen call us saying their wives think it\u2019s \u2018disgusting and dirty\u2019 not to circumcise their sons. It\u2019s sad,\u201d she says. \u201cIntactivists\u201d (portmanteau of \u201cintact\u201d and \u201cactivist\u201d) are raising their voices in increasing numbers about infant male circumcision \u2013 but are they being heard? Not according to Zeldis. \u201cI felt immense loss and grief that I\u2019d never be given the chance to experience sex the way nature intended it. And nobody in society cared. It was terribly isolating.\u201d America is the western nation with the highest proportion of infant male circumcisions. Many do it for non-religious and non-therapeutic reasons. Due to different tracking measures and non-uniform reporting of newborn circumcisions, the prevalence is difficult to measure accurately. One American healthcare agency report in 2012 found that circumcisions had dropped from around 60% in 2000 to 54.5% in 2009. Madison Zaliski, 26, gave birth to her son in Arkansas eight months ago. Despite not consenting, she was \u201casked multiple times a day\u201d when he would be circumcised. \u201cMost nurses thought it was a paperwork mistake,\u201d she says. The other notable western nations circumcising baby boys are Canada and Australia. The Canadian Paediatric Society uses the figure of 31.9%, based on research conducted in 2007. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians puts Australia and New Zealand\u2019s figure at between 10% and 20%. In the UK, the National Childbirth Trust estimates 8.5% of men are circumcised. The NHS stopped paying for it in the 1940s. \u2018It creates trauma, pain and risk\u2019 Why do it? The most common response is custom: because dad did. Zeldis says this is the \u201cresponse people like my parents give when they don\u2019t really know why\u201d. The non-religious history, at least in America, comes from the Victorian myth that masturbation was dangerous because the loss of semen would weaken a boy permanently, and threaten the moral order. It was thought that circumcision would somehow prevent masturbation. The 1960s sexual revolution debunked that. Chapin\u2019s passion to end infant male circumcision came from her younger brother: \u201cI remember seeing his bloody penis and being taken back to have his urethra forcibly reopened \u2013 it sealed over as a result of his circumcision. The trauma kept returning.\u201d She lists her reasons against the practice like a scattergun: \u201cYou can\u2019t go cutting the body parts of people without consent unless it\u2019ll kill them. It creates trauma, pain and risk. It permanently alters a child\u2019s body and their sexual function and pleasure later in life. And it\u2019s a waste of medical resources \u2013 but American medicine is a money machine and if a procedure is refundable, it\u2019ll happen.\u201d I hear these reasons repeatedly from opponents of circumcision. Zeldis\u2019s adult perception of his operation is echoed in many of their stories: \u201cSomeone strapped me down and cut off part of my genitals with a clamp and knife, forever changing my sex life, for no reason. If you touch leftover tissue, it\u2019s highly sensitive \u2013 and that\u2019s the majority of what\u2019s cut off. There\u2019s no \u2018cut here\u2019 mark, so men are all left with different versions of the procedure.\u201d Those protesting against circumcision have, as of this year, fallen into two closely related camps. The first group is those keen to reframe vocabulary around \u201ccircumcision\u201d into \u201cmale genital mutilation\u201d. The same lexicon recurs for these men: violation, non-consent, maimed, rage, powerlessness. The second group is reclaiming the foreskin by celebrating it. It\u2019s led by people like Damien Williams, 45, from Sydney. He tells the Guardian: \u201cWe realised we don\u2019t need to fight the battle against circumcision, and decided to lay down arms on that front. Let the circumcisers have that brand, and all the cutting, blood, fear, pain and hate for the human body that goes with it. Let them try to sell that to a public now embracing the positive-body movement and has a healthy scepticism for people in white coats selling them things they don\u2019t need. We made a pact to push forward a new brand \u2013 foreskin!\u201d Part of the brand is foreskin restoration for men cut as babies. Williams realised the need to do it because of discomfort in his teens. \u201cI was constantly irritated by my glans rubbing against clothing. I knew even from this age that I was supposed to have a protective covering,\u201d he says. Restoration techniques, which involve weighted tugging devices inserted on to the end of the penis, can be arduous. They didn\u2019t work out for Zeldis. \u201cIt requires years of dedicated disciplined practice which I\u2019ve been unable to give,\u201d he says. \u201cThose devices are uncomfortable to wear all day.\u201d But for Williams, it was revelatory: \u201cAfter gaining enough restored foreskin, the main new experience for me in addition to the protection was the \u2018rolling\u2019 function, where the foreskin glides over the glans. I realised: \u2018Oh, THIS is what a normal penis is supposed to do.\u2019\u201d He channeled his anger at that function being \u201cstolen\u201d from him into the restoration process, which he finds psychologically healing. Goals to ban the practice on minors risk accusations of Islamophobia or antisemitism. But the US Council of Muslim Organisations said it was \u201cnot an issue we\u2019ve dealt with\u201d. Although not mentioned in the Qur\u2019an, circumcision is mentioned in the Sunna \u2013 the practice of the Prophet Muhammad \u2013 and has been a religious custom since the beginning of Islam. It\u2019s done for cleanliness; Muslims believe the removal of the foreskin makes it easier to keep the penis clean because urine and other matter can\u2019t get trapped there. Shimon Koffler Fogel, chief executive of Canada\u2019s Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, explains the biblical reason for circumcision: \u201cFrom when God first commanded Abraham to circumcise himself and his household, this ritual has become a symbol of the covenant between God and the Jewish people. From an esoteric perspective, Jewish sages have explained that man was created imperfect \u2013 with the requirement of circumcision to achieve that perfection.\u201d Fogel says \u201copposition to it is more a device of anti-religion activists than genuine concern for what is a fabricated issue\u201d. When I put some of the language used by opponents to him, he says: \u201cClearly it\u2019s not an \u2018amputation\u2019. Nor can it be considered in the same way as FGM [female genital mutilation]. Undertaken at birth, it neither constitutes a gross abuse of the infant, nor a significant healthcare risk.\u201d Medical miracle or genital mutilation? Medical opinions differ. Cheryl Gowar from the UK\u2019s National Aids Trust says: \u201cMedical male circumcision reduces the possibility of HIV transmission from HIV-positive women to HIV-negative men by around 50%. Circumcision may also decrease sexual transmission of HIV in men who have sex with men (for the insertive partner), although studies on this are inconclusive.\u201d The NHS, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and the Canadian Paediatric Department agree that studies about circumcision reducing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases are inconclusive and spurious because they were carried out in African countries such as Uganda, and the higher rates of STIs there are not comparable to western countries. None of these organisations recommends the routine circumcision of newborn males. Paediatrician Dr Paul Bauert says the Royal Australasian College of Physicians believes the frequency of diseases modifiable by circumcision (penile cancer, HIV, STIs, UTIs) and the complication rates don\u2019t warrant routine infant circumcision in Australia and New Zealand. And, he says, \u201cethical and human rights concerns have been raised regarding elective infant male circumcision because it\u2019s recognised that the foreskin has a functional role\u201d. That functional role includes a dispute over how many nerve endings the foreskin has to enhance sexual function and pleasure (estimates vary between 20,000 and 100,000, making it the most sensitive part of the penis and an erogenous zone). But Chapin says: \u201cHow many nerve endings would make it OK? The body is designed that way, for that sexual function.\u201d In addition to potential loss of sensitivity, there are stories of painful erections. A study of 5,552 people found that circumcision was associated with frequent orgasm difficulties in Danish men. In the Netflix documentary American Circumcision, for every medical professional who makes claims about the benefits of male circumcision, there are three who will dispute the risk-to-benefit ratio. Intactivists and foreskin reclaimers are speaking up in higher numbers, but many will not. Zeldis has a theory as to why: \u201cThe majority of circumcised men tell themselves it was good for them. The alternative to that denial involves admitting you were harmed and sexually maimed as a child in one of your most sensitive areas. \u201cMany men don\u2019t want to psychologically deal with that. It\u2019s overwhelming.\u201d This article was amended on 24 July 2019.
