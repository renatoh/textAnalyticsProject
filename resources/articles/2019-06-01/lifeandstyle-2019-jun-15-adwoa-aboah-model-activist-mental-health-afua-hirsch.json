I wanted to jump out of my skin\u2019", "bodyText": "Adwoa Aboah\u2019s clothes are causing a stir, and not \u2013 as you might expect from one of the world\u2019s most recognisable models \u2013 in a fashion sense. Her team are worried that her black hoodie, featuring the colourful logo of a young, disruptive sportswear brand, won\u2019t fit with the podcast she is recording about girls\u2019 mental health when the pictures go up on Instagram. Aboah\u2019s not having it. \u201cNah \u2013 these are my boys,\u201d she says, of the designers behind the hoodie. \u201cAnyway, would you prefer the one I have on underneath?\u201d She lifts her top to reveal a white T-shirt that says: \u201cBlowjobs are real jobs.\u201d There is a story behind the T-shirt, of course. It was designed by a friend of hers who is a sex worker and a lesbian, but is proud of her work with male clients. The friend sometimes stays at Aboah\u2019s parents\u2019 house, freaking out Aboah\u2019s dad with stories of douching her vagina. Soon enough, Aboah\u2019s team have changed their minds. \u201cYou know what, let\u2019s keep the black hoodie on,\u201d says one. \u201cIt works fine.\u201d At 26, Aboah is one of the most photographed women in the world. She has graced the cover of US, Spanish, German, Italian, Mexican and British Vogues, as well as W, i-D and Time magazine. She regularly adorns 100ft canvases in airports, or the sides of buses or shop fronts. She has her own line of jewellery and her own Barbie, with a brown complexion and a shaved head. Today, there is a heart barbered into her cropped hair, one of her many adornments, along with delicate hand-scrawled tattoos, signet rings, neck chains, bracelets and her signature tooth gem. These days, Aboah describes herself as an activist first and a model second. It is hard not to be a little sceptical: what self-respecting celebrity these days is complete without a pet cause, a United Nations appointment or a wellbeing-oriented Instagram account? It is admirable when people use their fame to do good, of course; it is just hard to tell, sometimes, where the PR ends and the conviction begins. The more time I spend with Aboah \u2013 several hours, over two days \u2013 the harder that scepticism is to sustain. She puts a tremendous amount of effort into her mental health charity, Gurls Talk, which she founded in 2015 as an Instagram account, growing it into a weekly podcast and a series of global events that have brought girls and women together in cities from London and Los Angeles to Accra and Warsaw. When I ask her about these, she beams with pride. \u201cI really felt very confident when we did the Gurls Talk event in Poland,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought: this is in Europe and there are going to be a lot of similarities [with British audiences]. But when we talked about abortion, religion really came into the equation, and how you were brought up. It was a big moment for Gurls Talk \u2013 girls had travelled from small towns, the panel discussions went on for hours. I had no idea we had this community there.\u201d The event Aboah seems most proud of took place last year in her father\u2019s birth country, Ghana. The format is consistent across Gurls Talk events: a panel of local women and girls engage with an audience who, in countries such as Ghana, may not be used to opening up about their experiences. \u201cI introduced each panel, but I made a point of handing the torch over to give all these amazing women the chance to do what they do,\u201d Aboah says. \u201cAt first, everyone was a bit shy, but then they started putting their hands up and sharing all these things \u2013 around sexual assault in school, for example, things I didn\u2019t necessarily know were such big subjects because I didn\u2019t grow up in Ghana. But I have been going there all my life. It was monumental to me.\u201d Aboah does not always feel so confident. A few weeks ago, she was speaking at a GQ magazine event where Piers Morgan was also on the bill, talking to Alastair Campbell about political interviews. \u201cI watched him say all this stuff, and when they opened it up to the floor, all of us [Aboah and her friends] were too scared to say anything, because we didn\u2019t want to be bullied. Because he is a bully,\u201d Aboah says, referring to Morgan\u2019s reputation for shouting down guests. \u201cThere are times when I do feel quite fearful about talking about politics. You have to be knowledgable and articulate,\u201d she says. \u201cThat always scares me, as someone who has struggled academically and is highly dyslexic.\u201d If you look online for the most publicised images of Aboah, in among the Fendi, Versace and Gap campaigns you will find photographs of her sitting in the bath, looking vacant and frail, shortly after an attempt to kill herself in 2014. \u201cI look at these photos and I see a different person staring back at me\u2026 the darkness had overtaken me, the grey had engulfed my life, I was broken, exhausted and the light has completely left my eyes,\u201d she wrote about her suicide attempt last year, in an Instagram post to mark World Mental Health Day. Aboah had overdosed; she was in a coma for four days, before recovering in a psychiatric hospital. \u201cI mourn the girl I once was, it\u2019s almost as if I\u2019d like to jump into the photo, kiss away the tears, hug her for ever and tell her that she\u2019s not alone.\u201d It was a heartbreaking memo to her younger self, who had a ketamine addiction and poor mental health. Since her recovery, she has spoken frankly about that low point and about her treatment for depression, addiction and bipolar disorder, problems that began much earlier, she says, when she was a teenager at boarding school. \u201cI think it was obvious something was wrong, because I would miss loads of school. I just thought it was because I was really homesick,\u201d Aboah says, matter-of-factly. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel suicidal or anything like that then. I just wanted to jump out of my skin. I felt unhappy and insecure and pressured. But I don\u2019t see why things have to get to rock bottom before you\u2019re able to get help \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t be like that. With Gurls Talk, I\u2019ve created a space where we get to talk about those things, where we get to bring all our shit into that room, where anything and everything is important.\u201d Aboah talks constantly about \u201cour girls\u201d and says her work on the podcast is about giving them an opportunity to \u201cswitch off, put your headphones on and, when you are thinking negatively, just block out the outside world. By the end of the episode, I want to give girls the tools to block out the darkness and go forward.\u201d That may sound earnest, but her podcast is a joyful affair, involving interviews with compelling and inspiring young women; a recent episode brought together the champion sprinter Dina Asher-Smith and the hip-hop DJ Tiffany Calver to talk about their competitive natures. It is the kind of frank conversation, about how to navigate the world as a young woman \u2013 and a black woman \u2013 that the teenage Aboah needed. She was raised around the fashion industry: her father, Charles Aboah, is a location scout, while her white, English mother, Camilla Lowther, founded the agency CLM in 1984 and went on to represent many of the biggest photographers, stylists and film-makers in the business. Aboah describes her younger sister Kesewa \u2013 who has modelled for Alexander McQueen and Miu Miu, and recently completed an art degree in New York \u2013 as her \u201csoulmate\u201d. But Aboah felt like the more vulnerable member of her close-knit family. \u201cKesewa has always been the more carefree one. I was always painfully shy,\u201d Aboah says. Her confidence was further knocked by dyslexia, which made school a struggle. \u201cI worked, I tried to get the grades. But an exam based on how much I\u2019d revised didn\u2019t really work with me. I would just get into those exam rooms and fail.\u201d That sense of failure, Aboah now realises, had long-term effects. \u201cThe trauma that surrounds you feeling like you were stupid is something that stays with you for a long time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I got sober that I realised it didn\u2019t matter that I couldn\u2019t punctuate or spell. I could still write if I wanted to.\u201d Drug abuse among her peers added to young Aboah\u2019s demons. \u201cDrugs came quite early on. Too early on,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I went into treatment that I realised that it was very odd that we started taking drugs that young.\u201d It was after Aboah left school \u2013 to do a degree in drama at Brunel University London \u2013 and began working that her drug use, especially of ketamine, began to spiral. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really being that honest. And I was using that as a kind of crutch to make me feel a little bit better,\u201d she says. Aboah had started modelling by then \u2013 at first, fairly informal shoots through her mother\u2019s network, then more professional ones after leaving school and university. Was modelling part of the problem? \u201cMy work ethic at that time wasn\u2019t that great,\u201d Aboah says. \u201cI found it quite embarrassing to feel upset about the rejections. So I didn\u2019t really ever sit in the emotions very long. And then I would watch certain girls, and their careers had gone completely differently to mine. They had been supported by British publications and I had never felt that support. I would definitely say there was envy and jealousy. At the same time, I didn\u2019t necessarily care about that side of my life that much.\u201d Her career was on the up, but, battling her demons, Aboah\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t in it. *** Growing up, I knew and dearly loved Aboah\u2019s grandparents, met but barely knew her parents, and heard about but never met Aboah. Like many mixed-race children in Britain, we had overlapping Ghanaian families (her father is related to my mother\u2019s family), but we straddled other worlds, too. Neither of us was firmly part of any one community. We were dispersed in different, predominantly white environments, places where our African heritage put us in a minority of one or two. The first time I met Aboah, at a party a couple of years ago, I was struck by her honesty. Whatever the subject, she doesn\u2019t dial it up or down; she approaches every topic, whether her suicide attempt or her plans for the evening, with the same degree of openness, all delivered in a deadpan, impossibly gravelly voice. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way I speak,\u201d Aboah says. \u201cI know the importance of sharing one\u2019s story and being really honest about it.\u201d By her own admission, there are some things that come to the surface more easily than others. When she started Gurls Talk, the focus was on mental health experiences. Over time, she began to see the relevance of, and include more discussions about, race and identity. \u201cGrowing up, I saw myself as not-black-enough and not-white-enough,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it was only when I got to boarding school that I was like: \u2018Oh my God, this is an issue.\u2019\u201d Her racial heritage led to a level of exclusion \u2013 \u201clike, watching all the girls in my school wearing Dream Matte Mousse foundation.\u201d The foundation was a 90s sensation, but \u2013 as I can attest \u2013 its colours were a hopeless fit for almost all black skin tones. \u201cI just didn\u2019t understand that putting on \u2018skin-colour\u2019 tights was a thing I couldn\u2019t do.\u201d I tell Aboah that, as a mixed-race girl in a very white school environment, I shared these experiences. I was convinced that boys were not interested in me. \u201cOh, they definitely were not interested in me,\u201d Aboah says. \u201cI could just piece it together from the girls who were idolised. I was never going to look like them. So I immediately thought I was hideous.\u201d The sense of rejection went deep. \u201cI truly believe that if I\u2019d been given some sort of space to really get down to it \u2013 to talk about being a virgin, to talk about my insecurities around my hair, all these things \u2013 it would have made a big difference,\u201d she says. Hair is an issue for so many black women, and Aboah\u2019s experience is no exception. At the beginning of her modelling career, hair anxiety became an unwelcome part of her day. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly explain to someone the embarrassment of sitting in a chair at a modelling job and having 10 people around your head, struggling with your hair,\u201d Aboah says. \u201cOr what it\u2019s like taking your hair out of a ponytail and watching in the mirror as someone goes like this\u201d \u2013 she feigns a catastrophic facial expression. \u201cYou can\u2019t explain to someone what it\u2019s like to wear a hat for four years because you didn\u2019t want someone to touch your hair, or snogging someone, fearing that they might try and put their hands through it when you\u2019ve got your hair grease in it, or they\u2019re going to ruin it. I think only a black girl will ever, ever understand that,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd sometimes I can\u2019t even be bothered to explain it.\u201d In 2015, Aboah entered rehab and recovery, founded Gurls Talk and took a break from modelling. What happened next shows the power of abandoning attempts to please others and, in short, not giving a damn. Because it was when Aboah shaved her head \u2013 against the advice of her agency \u2013 that her career went stratospheric. \u201cEverything feels better when I\u2019m doing me with full force,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is who I am. Rejection feels less painful because I\u2019m being myself. If they don\u2019t get it, someone else will.\u201d *** I sit down a couple of days after our interview to watch her record a Gurls Talk podcast, as she interviews Jawahir Roble, AKA JJ, the first female, Muslim qualified football referee in the UK. In a plush basement studio in London, Aboah draws out JJ\u2019s remarkable life story: how she defied the odds to play football, and then to persuade her sceptical parents that it was what she was supposed to do. Aboah, the schoolgirl who was convinced she was stupid and ugly, is a quick-witted, fluent interviewer. The podcast has a clear structure: Gurls Talk, where the guest shares their story; Gurls Share, where listeners send in their experiences; Gurls Listen, where the guest shares their coping mechanism; Gurls Take Control, where Aboah and her interviewee talk about what they have learned; and Gurls Take Action, where they work out what, practically, they can do next. It sounds prescriptive, but Aboah is so good at guiding JJ through the hour they spend in the recording booth, at bringing out the humour in her story \u2013 how to explain mud on your shoes to the dad who has forbidden you from playing football \u2013 that it works. Later, I ask her how being part of the fashion industry fits with her work around mental health. It is a complicated question, not least for a black woman who knows the power of that industry to foster a sense of exclusion, but also as someone who was born into an affluent family established in that world. \u201cI think about modelling and whether it works alongside everything I advocate,\u201d she says. \u201cI question whether it\u2019s a part of this idea of beauty that does harm. But then I think about the younger me, and seeing someone like me reflected back would 100% have helped her. Just me being unapologetically myself is even more important than my face.\u201d Aboah and her friends talk a lot about race and identity. \u201cPeople always used to ask about my accent and about being posh \u2013 they didn\u2019t really think I could be black because I spoke like that,\u201d she laughs. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t underestimate my privilege as being more light-skinned. My black friends and I always talk about \u2018the quota\u2019,\u201d (the idea that brands only include a limited number of people of colour, creating opportunities for a privileged few). \u201cIt\u2019s definitely helped me that I fit into a certain box.\u201d While acknowledging her privilege in a world where \u201ccolourism\u201d remains rife, she identifies as black rather than mixed race. \u201cWe don\u2019t really say \u2018mixed race\u2019 any more,\u201d she says, referring to conversations with friends who have one white parent. \u201cWe always say we are black. I think it\u2019s about feeling part of something, feeling part of a movement and a bigger community. I\u2019m like: \u2018Well, I\u2019m not white, am I?\u2019\u201d She says she feels \u201ca massive connective to my African heritage. I will never forget going to my auntie and uncle\u2019s [in Ghana] and getting my hair braided and washing it over the bathtub, the food we would eat, the chilli, sleepovers with family. It is an unbreakable bond.\u201d After a stint living in New York, Aboah is now based in London and counts among her close friends other fashion royalty, such as the model Cara Delevingne and the editor of British Vogue, Edward Enninful (she was his first Vogue cover). At the same time, she is clearly striving to maintain a sense of normality. The last time I saw her was when I went to hear Michelle Obama speak at the Southbank Centre in London, where before the event she chatted excitedly in the stalls along with everyone else. I\u2019ve met her boyfriend \u2013 she keeps details of their relationship private, only saying that, unlike her, he rarely travels. When I ask her how he is, for the first time she becomes bashful and coy. For now, her priority is Gurls Talk, and maintaining a balance in her personal life. She recently took part in a \u201cleadership lab\u201d at the UN, a two-day workshop that brought together female leaders and activists to help them scale up their work. \u201cWe had a lot of sessions and quite a few of the women described having burned themselves out to the point of being hospitalised,\u201d Aboah says. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult when you\u2019re doing activism. You don\u2019t go to bed and the job is done \u2013 you wake up and there are still the same problems. You can exhaust yourself, and I have done.\u201d She acknowledges that she is a \u201ccomplete workaholic\u201d. She relies heavily on what she describes as her \u201camazing team\u201d, composed mostly of young women she has chosen to work with in place of more established agents, producers and publicists. The plan is to establish a charity that can move forward even without its famous figurehead. \u201cGurls Talk can stand on its own two feet without me,\u201d Aboah says. \u201cIt\u2019s needed all over the world, but that doesn\u2019t mean I am.\u201d As I leave, she is trying to organise an impromptu football match with her mates. There is no way JJ is going to leave the studio without getting recruited. \u201cYou\u2019re going to play with us, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Aboah asks. I think she\u2019s going to have a hard time saying no. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.
