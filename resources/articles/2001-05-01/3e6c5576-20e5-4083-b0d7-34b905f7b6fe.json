But surely jaded western magazine consumers should know? This week, an out-of-court settlement agreed by IPC and VNU Business Publications highlighted the significance to magazine publishers of protecting their brands, if necessary through the courts. IPC agreed to a series of undertakings relating to Web User, its newly launched consumer internet magazine, after a challenge from VNU, which was prepared to take IPC to court for \"passing off\" its own magazine, Computeractive. VNU has trumpeted the settlement as a major victory. It makes it pretty clear that it thinks it's been vindicated in taking IPC to court. Computeractive's unique selling point is its accessibility. Launched in 1998, it quickly became the tabloid newspaper of the computer publishing industry, speaking to the lay person in no-nonsense language and deciphering the vagaries of Unix kernels, DOS programming or TCP/IP protocols that made up the staple content of much of the computer press. This, combined with aggressive marketing by VNU and clever tie-ins with the nationals, made the magazine a huge success, recording a launch ABC of 325,000. So successful that a series of publishers piled on the bandwagon. Last year, Future Network poached several of Computeractive's editorial team, including launch editor Dylan Armbrust, to create a rival. After a long gestation period, the magazine was axed before launch earlier this year as the company faced mounting financial difficulties. IPC, which had been rumoured to be waiting in the wings to create a rival, pounced on the wreckage of the magazine, taking a number of key editorial staff. Finally, IPC launched Web User to great fanfare. It was its first foray into the previously off-limits world of IT, and it went into battle with world domination rhetoric. Not only was IPC squatting on VNU's patch, paying its former staff higher salaries and picking their brains, it now had the cheek to come out with what the company saw as a carbon copy of the jewel in its crown. VNU, already mildly paranoid about the competition, took IPC to court, with a date set for July. This week IPC made its undertakings to VNU about Web User. First, neither Web User nor any other computer magazine will feature a front cover title in which the first half is in black and the second in white. Second, it has agreed not to use a sloping red masthead and, third, it will no longer feature a panel called \"workshops\". Computeractive's editor, James Harding, says the degree of similarity was such that VNU's lawyers, Slaughter and May, were confident that they had a case for passing off. \"We had a lot of responses from readers saying: 'I bought your magazine and imagine my surprise when I found it was a different magazine'\". Passing off, defined by the Oxford Dictionary of Business English as \"conducting a business in a manner that misleads the public into thinking one's goods and services are those of another business,\" is notoriously difficult to prove. It's especially hard, say lawyers, in an industry such as magazine publishing, where there's a greater degree of homogeneity than with, say, consumer goods. \"The problem with magazine publishers is that they tend to choose descriptive titles with very small nuances of difference,\" says Joel Barry, a solicitor with intellectual property specialists Olswang. \"Small differences in branding between, say, Woman's Realm and Woman's World are enough difference, legally, to stop you getting into trouble where you may actually have produced a title almost identical to another one. The litmus test is proving that the consumer is confused as to which title is which.\" VNU says that with 20 witness statements from users saying that they thought Web User was a sister title, it had a clear case. One of the landmark magazine passing off cases was won by National Magazines against IPC in the early 90s. National Magazines is believed to have settled out of court with IPC after accusing them of imitating House Beautiful with Homes and Ideas. IPC accepted that design similarities were such that consumers could have been confused, and agreed to make the necessary changes. But a case brought by the Financial Times that the Evening Standard's use of its pink pages was a passing off was lost, on the grounds that no one reading the Standard - even the pink pages - would think that they were reading the FT. Legal sources say that to be successful in bringing a passing off case, you need to challenge the newcomer fairly soon after launch. Hello! magazine stopped short of taking its Northern &amp; Shell rival OK! to court in 1998 after the magazine was repositioned to compete directly with Hello!, largely because Hello! proprietor Eduardo Sanchez did not want to face a court battle. Insiders say Hello! could have won at the time, but would be less likely to do so now because OK! has become a well-established brand in its own right and consumers are well aware of the differences between the magazines. You also need to prove that you have a reputation that others could credibly be jealous of, and that the other party has deliberately mimicked you. Barry says that, initially, it was necessary to prove that the mimicking was designed to harm, but increasingly, \"as media companies become more and more aware of the importance of protecting brands, they can win cases more easily\". Are magazines going to follow TV production companies into the courts to battle over formats? David Attfield of law firm Lovells thinks Charlie Parsons/Endemol-style scraps over magazine formats are fairly unlikely. \"Magazine consumers are very sophisticated and they know a lot more about marketing and brand differences than the publishers may think. And because the formats tend to be very well-established, there's less room for genuine innovation.\" But as Computeractive editor James Harding points out, all media companies are very protective of their brands in markets where there is so much competition. \"The pressure is on media companies to keep expanding and creating new brands, and the temptation is simply to do what everyone else has done.\" Magazines continue to behave like amoebae, subdividing into ever more subtle variations on a theme. And the lawyers are watching."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
