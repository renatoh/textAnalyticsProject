A few months ago the thought of Jon Dahl Tomasson, a laughing stock at Newcastle, posing the biggest threat to England's progress to the World Cup quarter-finals would have seemed implausible. Now where once there was ridicule there is only mild regret. Four years after sneaking away from Tyneside a shot-shy emotional wreck Tomasson is the second top scorer in the World Cup finals behind Germany's Miroslav Klose. His four goals are as many as he scored in a whole season with Newcastle; the murmur of misgiving that would sweep across the Toon Army when his name was announced over the Tannoy before kick-off must seem a distant nightmare. \"I'm proud of what I've achieved here so far but team spirit not individual achievement has been the key to our success,\" said the 25-year-old after contributing the second goal to Denmark's 2-0 victory over France on Tuesday. \"Mentally we are strong and we'll need that to cope with being underdogs against England. Playing them will be massive, a bigger match even than against Sweden. There are so many superstars in English football.\" Tomasson was never one of them. Having made his name at Heerenveen, where he scored 37 goals in 78 games, he was signed by Kenny Dalglish for \u00a32.2m in the summer of 1997. The Scot intended to play him behind Alan Shearer to link with the midfield in a formation that should have flourished in the Champions League. After a debut goal in the pre-season Makita tournament and a hatful on a summer tour of Ireland life seemed rosy. \"When he first joined Newcastle he was magnificent,\" said his then team-mate Peter Beardsley. \"Watching him at close quarters in pre-season he was a frightening talent and everyone thought he would go on to make a huge impact.\" Then Shearer was injured, not to return until the turn of the year, and Faustino Asprilla joined him on the sidelines. Tomasson was thrust up front as an out-and-out striker and the sitter he missed in his first game, against Sheffield Wednesday set the miserable tone. \"He was clean through from the halfway line but he fluffed it,\" Beardsley recalled. \"From that day he was never the same player. Had Alan Shearer been fit we would have seen a different Tomasson but the lad often had to play in attack on his own. He was just unlucky.\" A return of three goals in 23 league appearances highlighted how uncomfortable Tomasson was in that role. \"These days I can play as a lone striker,\" he said, a point he proved against the French. \"But back then I wasn't physically strong enough. I was 19 and too young to handle the pressure. Without Alan and Tino everyone expected me to fill their shoes and play like them and that got to me. How can you replace Alan Shearer?\" His confidence sapped, Tomasson slipped out of the first team and into the gallery of multi-million pound flops. The only reason his name flickered back into the lime light long after he had returned to the relative obscurity of the Dutch league was because his apologetic lob over Crystal Palace's Kevin Miller at Selhurst Park in November 1997 proved to be Newcastle's last winning goal in London for four years and 29 games, elevating Tomasson almost to cult status. \"I loved being at Newcastle but I hardly remember any playing highlights,\" he said. \"Dalglish defended me and stressed that I was playing out of position and I tried my best but it wasn't right. I never had a chance to show what I could do. It was hard at the time but, looking back, that year made me stronger. You have to learn from football.\" He did so to spectacular effect. At Feyenoord he dropped deeper yet scored 38 in his first three seasons, adding another 17 last term. Along the way he broke into the Denmark squad, scored six times in seven fixtures and almost single-handedly propelled them to Euro 2000. But the goal he scored at the De Kuip Stadium to win the Uefa Cup last May proved to be his last for Feyenoord; though Barcelona had been sniffing for his signature, he opted to sign a four-year deal with Milan. His style should flourish in the less frenzied pace of Serie A, suggesting the Rossoneri may have pulled off something of a coup. \"Jon can play in several positions and suits our system,\" added the Denmark coach Morten Olsen, who in relying heavily on Tomasson's goals has not lost a competitive match since taking up his post two years ago. \"Against the French he played the role in which he had struggled at Newcastle, yet you saw how disciplined he is working for the team. \"He did so much running to help us start defending on the halfway line and used his brain really well. Of course we hope he maintains that form and I'm sure he will. After all, he has a point to prove to Newcastle.\" Three more dangerous Danes STIG TOFTING (Bolton Wanderers) Age 32 Caps 40 Goals 2 Combative and abrasive, the 32-year-old with \"no regrets\" tattooed across his back is integral to Denmark's midfield, where his strong-arm presence has dictated play. The \"Little Lawnmower\" fell out of favour at Hamburg and stumbled through an injury-plagued spell at the Reebok but has been inspirational in the Far East. \"We want to send England home,\" he barked yesterday. \"We'll be ready, because this will be special.\" JESPER GRONKJAER (Chelsea) Age 24 Caps 29 Goals 2 Danny Mills can hardly relish coming up against the Chelsea wide man. He may only have made stuttering appearances in the group games but should feature because of his inside knowledge of English football if nothing else. A \u00a37.8m signing from Ajax, his blistering pace and dribbling skills were missed at Chelsea during a five-month absence through injury. He came off the bench to lay on Tomasson's goal against France, putting some mild but tactless criticism of the management behind him. DENNIS ROMMEDAHL (PSV Eindhoven) Age 23 Caps 23 Goals 7 A tetchy relationship with his club has not hampered the winger's impact on the national team, with the two goals he scored against Germany in Copenhagen in November merely underlining his talent. When Thomas Linke is not having nightmares about the roasting handed to him by Michael Owen in Munich last September, he must be suffering flashbacks to the 23-year-old's breathtaking performance that night. Capable of streaming down either flank, his smart goal against the French could further fuel the transfer speculation linking him with Lazio, Newcastle and Aston Villa. In Niigata on Saturday, with Geordies everywhere pinching themselves, Tomasson will try to put the record straight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
