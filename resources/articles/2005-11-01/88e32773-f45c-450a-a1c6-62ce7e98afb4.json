He made his last movie, Clash of the Titans, in 1981, ending a 30-year-career in which he virtually singlehandedly wrote, directed, shot, lit, art-directed, modelled and animated some of the most remarkable moments in the genre. By 1981, though, his speciality was an anachromism. George Lucas had released the first Star Wars movie four years earlier, ushering in a new era of special-effects film. Since then CGI - computer-generated imagery - has become the centrepiece of an increasingly industrialised film business. It's an irony that the masters of this new techno-trousered advance, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, John Landis, James Cameron and Peter Jackson, are all die-hard Harryhausen devotees. Now the perversely quaint, relatively low-budget art of stop-motion - in which static models are moved frame by frame - is undergoing a minor renaissance. Last month saw the release of Aardman's Curse of the Were-Rabbit and Tim Burton's Corpse Bride. Both movies were created by people who, as short-trousered adolescents, had also been lulled by Harryhausen's craft. Both contain overt homages to Harryhausen; the quirkily ghoulish Corpse Bride even includes a skeleton battle sequence that is a straight nod towards his 1963 masterpiece Jason and the Argonauts. And, in a bizarre moment of synchronicity, both movies feature the same in-joke; a piano where the maker's name is displayed above the keys as 'Harryhausen'. 'Well,' smiles Harryhausen, a tall, broad-shouldered man, 'people keep trying to say that stop-motion is dead.' He sits on a dining chair; he finds it easier these days than the sofa. Olivia, his wife, offers coffee. Los Angeles-born Harryhausen moved in 1960 to Britain where the Rank laboratory's expertise in 'travelling matte' allowed him to expose film twice, once with real-life characters, once with his models. His technological expertise in a pre-CGI world is one of the things that awes the new generation of British animators such as Aardman's Nick Park, or Peter Saunders of Mackinnon and Saunders who made the puppets for Corpse Bride. 'His technique was incredibly sophisticated,' says Saunders. 'The mystery of how he produced some of the effects is part of the allure. That he was pretty much a one-man-band is phenomenal.' Harryhausen says he hasn't yet seen Corpse Bride but he thinks Aardman's animation is 'beautifully done'. Though their success may be minor, both movies represent a counter-revolution against computer animation. Tim Burton recalls how production companies, awed by Shrek's takings, offered him extra money to deliver Corpse Bride as a CGI movie. But he refused, believing that puppetry retains a magic that CGI can't begin to emulate. Just as Harryhausen has inspired a new wave of model animators here, his own epiphany came when he was 13 and his aunt received free tickets to see Willis O'Brien's King Kong. 'I've never forgotten it,' says Harryhausen. 'The dinosaurs, and King Kong particularly. It was like a nightmare. People are so critical of the movie today, but for its time it was unique.' Within six months he had figured out the rudiments of stop-motion and was experimenting with a boxy 16mm Victor movie camera. Harryhausen was an only child, and was, like many teenage boys, obsessed with the world of fantasy. In his teens he became a member of the Los Angeles Science Fiction Society, where he befriended the author Ray Bradbury. Mostly though he retreated to the garage when not at school. His parents indulged him. His father was a machinist and made his first real armatures, the metal skeletons that sat inside the latex puppets. His mother cut up the curtains to clothe them. By 18 he was making an absurdly ambitious film called The Evolution of the World. The first sequence was of dinosaurs. He took the results to show to O'Brien. 'I'd contacted him after King Kong,' remembers Harryhausen. 'He invited me down to his studio at MGM and I brought some of my dinosaurs in a suitcase. There weren't many people interested in that type of thing at that time, so I was rather unique, I guess.' In fact, O'Brien was critical of Harryhausen's work. The legs of his stegasaurus looked like sausages, tutted O'Brien. If he really wanted to animate models he'd better go away and study anatomy. Stung, Harryhausen did as he was told; but the two men remained friends and when O'Brien returned to the Kong theme for Mighty Joe Young, it was Harryhausen he hired to animate the gorilla. That movie's success, and what he learned working next to O'Brien, allowed him to make his own 1953 movie, The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, based on Bradbury's short story. Oddly enough, playing with dinosaurs and a camera in a garage seems to have been a rite of passage for most stop-frame fans. The day after he saw Kong on TV, director Peter Jackson picked up the Plasticene. 'My teenage years were fuelled by a desire to do exactly what Ray Harryhausen was doing ... create a new world, populated by new creatures, and bring them to life,' Jackson writes in the new book The Art of Ray Harryhausen There is a gender issue here. There are, of course, women model animators; but the unfashionable truth is that an awful lot of the genre's major practitioners were - and are - men. And many of them underwent that same rite of adolescent passage. It makes you wonder what is it about teenage boys that makes them create these miniature alternate worlds. 'It's not egomania, I promise you,' says Harryhausen. 'I was very modest in those days. I didn't discover for 50 years that modesty is the wrong quality in Hollywood.' There is a quiet sense of grievance; his pictures were never allowed the budgets his contemporaries had. When, in 1992, Tom Hanks presented him with an Oscar for Lifetime Achievement, Hanks lauded the director, saying, 'Some say Citizen Kane is the greatest motion picture of all time. Others say it's Casablanca. For me, the greatest picture of all time is Jason and the Argonauts.' 'That was delightful,' says Harryhausen, 'because it was ignored at the time.' There is a hint of bitterness in his voice. Did he feel it was a long time coming? 'Oh, certainly it was. The Academy ignored every film. So I was grateful we got an Oscar. But that was for Lifetime Achievement.' And you feel it should have been for a movie? 'They were considered B pictures because they were made on a tight budget. But we outlived many of the A pictures made at the same time.' For Harryhausen the frisson wasn't in the puppetry per se. The sense of horror in his films comes from setting the monsters against real footage of cities, landscapes and people. In the Cold War era, he and his audiences got a thrill from the genre he now describes as 'destroying cities'. The traumatised Japanese nation instantly took to the 'destroying cities' genre, and 1954's Godzilla was born. 'Oh, the Godzilla stuff was a direct ...' Harryhausen bites his tongue as he says it. 'I don't like to use that word. But that was a filch from The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms.' A series of other building-smashing movies followed, until Harryhausen discovered another fantastical scenario: Greek mythology. 'I'd got tired of destroying cities, you know? ' The greatest movies of his career, The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad and Jason and the Argonauts, followed. The actual Medusa from Clash of the Titans sits on a chaise longue in his front room, much smaller than you'd expect, only a foot high. Her snakes are a little frayed but there's still something wildly fierce about her. A small coffin lies next to her. 'Open the box,' he grins proudly. Inside lies one of the skeletons from Jason and the Argonauts In a workshop upstairs, reminiscent of his teenage garage, Harryhausen still tinkers, restoring many of the figures he's kept. 'A lot of them were cannibalised at the time because we were short of time and money. The tentacles from this character,' he says, 'became a dinosaur tail in the next movie.' CGI has breathed new life into the whole fantasy genre, with the result that many of the classics are being remade. In 1996 Harryhausen cameoed in the remake of Mighty Joe Young. Godzilla, too, has been remade, and Jackson's Kong is on its way. Harryhausen remains underwhelmed by the way special effects have colonised movies. 'Half the time I don't know what these movies are trying to tell me. They're just a series of explosions.' \u00b7 Ray Harryhausen presents a series of his films on Sky Cinema next Sunday.
