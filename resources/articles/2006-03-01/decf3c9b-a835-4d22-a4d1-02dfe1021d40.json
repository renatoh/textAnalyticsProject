That's an argument for another day. However there is one type of \"process\" which I confess has dominated the quarter of a century for which I have been a journalist. That is the process by which we do our work. When I was a student journalist, the shortlived publications on which I worked were cut-and-paste sheets, copied on offset lytho. Golf ball typewriters were the smartest thing around. My first working office wasn't much different. We weren't allowed to touch the clunky computers the secretaries toiled over. Then came pagers, faxes, desktop computers, mobile phones, laptops, digital, the web, texting, broadband, BlackBerries and Bluetooth - to name just a few of the wonders. Each one of these innovations not only changed the way we worked but also increased what we were capable of achieving. Those starting in journalism today will find themselves covering the news in ways not yet conceived of when they were training. I am old enough to have stood outside Our Price Records brandishing a small circle of shiny silver plastic, asking passers-by what a CD was and only getting one correct answer. More seriously, in 1992 when Norman Lamont gave his first reactions to Black Wednesday in a hastily-arranged doorstep in an inner courtyard with no electronic media facilities, I was able to cover it live for Sky on a mobile phone. In 2003, satellite phones were installed on BA, allowing journalists to learn about the death of David Kelly and to report on the prime minister's reaction before the plane on which they were all travelling touched down. Of course new technology is open to all who have the money and democratic freedom to access it. For all their complaints about \"24/7 media\" politicians have not been slow to exploit technological advances for their own ends. People used to laugh about Labour MPs being robots because they got their commands from the leadership by pager. Now all parties regularly send out their most important instant briefings by text message and no one is ever more than a phone call, text or email away. These days it is easy to send out different messages to different audiences, tailoring your words to its intended audience. For example Senator Hillary Clinton is working hard to shake off a leftwing image ahead of the 2008 Presidential race, so she never criticises the Iraq war in her mass media appearances. But she also has to worry about her core supporters, so her emails to signed-up party members express a lot more scepticism than her comments on TV. American campaigners reckon they will spend as much on internet communications, including podcast commercials, in the next campaign as they do on traditional paid-for TV ads. Britain hasn't quite gone that far, but electoral experts are considering how long it will be before you can cast your vote by text or email. Technology is also transforming the way the journalism we produce is consumed. I was lucky enough to work on the launches of Britain's first commercial breakfast television service (1983) and Britain's first 24 hour news channel (1989). But these innovations belong to the old era of linear, broadcast or \"push\" technology. The internet, ipods and personal video recorders mean that, increasingly, the public can \"pull\" down journalism at a time of their choosing, not according to a publisher's deadlines. It is important that journalists keep track of these changes and their implications. If we want to bring the information to the public then we've got to be on the media they want to use. Print and electronic journalism aren't just converging for the consumer, they are also converging for working journalists. I now do more writing than ever before in my on-screen career. For the MP3 owner's convenience, I've started to contribute regularly to the sound and vision podcasts available from Sky News and I have my own daily weblog (available on www.sky.com/skynews) to complement my live commentaries on Sky News' TV channel. Blogging brings home what I believe is the most fundamental transformation in the practice of journalism yet - interactivity. As fast as I report on screen or on the blog, comments and criticism are posted back at me. None of this traffic is comprehensively mediated. It could be rubbish but it ends up being published on the internet, if not on a Sky site then elsewhere, perhaps even self-published. Much of the material sent to us we are happy to broadcast. Thanks to mobile phones, members of the public often send us pictures and video of a breaking news story long before we can get our cameras there. We professional journalists want to be paid for our work. But now we have more freelance competition than ever before and we are under more scrutiny. So what have we got to offer that's worth buying? Only our expertise in gathering and communicating information. We have no market if the public won't trust us. Happily, expediency and the modern technological \"processes\" of journalism are forcing us to be honest - back to the basic values of our trade. \u00b7 Adam Boulton is political editor for Sky News"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
