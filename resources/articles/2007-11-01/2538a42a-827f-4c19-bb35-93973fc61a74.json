This has less to do with approaching winter than with the squeeze on further education funding that everyone expects to be confirmed this week in the government's grant letter to the Learning and Skills Council. One student from outside the European Union can easily bring a college more than \u00a35,000 a year in course fees. The problem is, recruiting them is far from easy. So says Peter Brown, director of international operations at Chichester College, West Sussex, which has been in the overseas game since it was opened in 1964. \"When recruiting international students, you must make sure the courses you are offering are actually running by the time those students arrive.\" Twenty years ago, Chichester College advertised a diploma in music. When a Malaysian woman arrived to do the course, it had closed due to lack of demand. \"We tried to find an alternative, but the student had come for this specific course. We provided a full refund, but from that day to this we have had very limited uptake from Malaysian schools. Agents have long memories.\" Other east Asian countries, however - Japan, China and Thailand, to name three - have proved rich veins for Chichester College. \"We started off by teaching English as a foreign language,\" Brown says. \"Now we have 800 international students a year, of whom half still come to study English and the other half to do academic and vocational courses with our home students.\" The college's first marketing mission was to Hong Kong, where there were students wanting to come to the UK to do GCSEs and A-levels. It helped that the college could offer accommodation. Over the past 20 years it has built halls that can now house 260 students and it operates a range of rented accommodation for the rest. But overseas students are wanted for more than just their cash supply. \"There are educational benefits,\" says Brown. \"In the past we've maintained some courses that were not popular with home students because international students want to do them, for instance A-level physics and chemistry. They are now more popular with home students again.\" Foreign students also bring a cosmopolitan atmosphere to a college such as Chichester, which does not have many people from ethnic minorities, Brown adds. In his years recruiting overseas students, Brown has learned that consistency and commitment are crucial. \"Without having a five-year budget and the commitment from governors, senior managers and staff, you can't expect to succeed. International marketing is not a short-term exercise.\" And even when a market is built up, that is just the start of the story. Markets need to be constantly nurtured and consolidated. Experience has left Brown sceptical about the worth of advertising the college or taking part in exhibitions overseas where up to 50 institutions set up stands. But good agents are invaluable, he says. As well as making contacts with schools and colleges in their countries, the best will be sought out by potential students."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
