Sandra Mahlberg had flown from Canberra to Melbourne, then from Darwin to Dili, in Timor-Leste, and now she was being ushered to a motorbike. It was an unusual excursion for someone drawing close to their retirement but Mahlberg was determined to find Lelia de Jesus Andrade. Last time they\u2019d seen each other, De Jesus Andrade had been flown to Canberra to give birth to her son. A scan had shown that baby Reinaldy had duodenal atresia, a condition that prevents the passage of stomach contents. Emergency surgery would be needed, and it had been funded and facilitated by the Rotary Oceania medical aid for children (Romac). Officially Mahlberg was in Dili volunteering on another Rotary project but she was moved to track down the mother and son. There are few actual addresses in Timor-Leste, but she knew the rough area. \u201cI had a photo, so I stopped kids in the street,\u201d she says. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t speak English, but they pointed me towards another boy with a motorbike. He said, \u2018Hop on and I\u2019ll take you around the area.\u2019\u201d Mahlberg wasn\u2019t feeling very daring so the boy rode beside her while they trekked the streets. Eventually they found De Jesus Andrade and her son. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Mahlberg says of the reunion. And that\u2019s sure to be quite the understatement. Mahlberg has been to Timor-Leste three times now, and it\u2019s this commitment to her volunteer work that saw her voted the Australian Capital Territory\u2019s senior Australian of the year in 2014. The nurse and midwife recently retired \u2013 but only from paid work. Since 2006 she\u2019s been the ACT coordinator for Romac, a program celebrating its 30th year in the territory. Now 20 children have undergone treatment through Romac in the ACT. But it\u2019s complicated. In 2010 eight-day-old Tava Bird from the Solomon Islands needed surgery to treat a blockage between his stomach and oesophagus. The hospital bill came to $140,000 and Rotary\u2019s district clubs had raised only $15,000. Mahlberg teamed up with a paediatric surgeon, Prof David Croaker, and they campaigned for a memorandum of understanding with ACT Health, with the result that four children a year are now covered to receive free care. Having that kind of impact still astonishes Mahlberg, for whom having a voice is a new development. \u201cThe first thing I did when I got divorced was join Rotary,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to feel sorry for myself, and the motto of Rotary is service above self. You learn a lot at times like these. I found out who I really was, and not just a mother or a nurse.\u201d Once a child is cleared to come over, Mahlberg puts the word out for a carer family and club, or takes the child and mother in herself \u2013 as she has done nine times. There\u2019s a lot of adjustment for kids coming to Australia so she knows not to push. \u201cAt the airport they won\u2019t go down the escalator because they\u2019re too scared,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll put out pyjamas but they\u2019ll sleep in their clothes. I do a lot of stir ries because the kids love green vegetables. I\u2019ve got a dog, which breaks the ice a bit, and we play number games like Tri-Onimos.\u201d Mahlberg goes with the family to appointments at hospitals such as Calvary John James with a translator provided by the embassy of the country of origin. Once a child has had their operation they often need to stay in Canberra until their condition has stabilised because hospitals in developing countries often lack rehabilitation facilities. She recalls the case of a Timorese baby, Santa, who had gastroschisis, a birth defect in which organs protrude from the body. Santa had been bound in plastic wrap in an attempt to keep her organs intact. \u201cWhile she was in intensive care, I stayed in hospital with her mum, Maria, and we topped and tailed at night,\u201d Mahlberg says. \u201cWe prayed together because that\u2019s what she needed. Santa was baptised in intensive care and I was the godmother.\u201d Santa made progress. But within weeks of being back in Timor she developed pneumonia and died. \u201cI went over on a red eye; I was devastated,\u201d Mahlberg says. \u201cI turned up at the funeral. Maria didn\u2019t know I was coming but I didn\u2019t want to just drop her.\u201d The nurses at the Timorese hospital were working as best they could but had only recently been taught the importance of hand washing, and were under-equipped. \u201cI was about to turn 60,\u201d says Mahlberg, \u201cso I had a fundraiser for my birthday to provide 30 pouches for the paediatric nurses, with scissors, forceps, calculators, thermometers, name tags and stethoscopes to make them feel like they had all the equipment.\u201d The kits were estimated to cost $4,500. The birthday donations came to $1,400, so Mahlberg resigned herself to making up the rest of the figure herself. It seemed her sense of goodwill had spread, however. When the equipment retailer heard about the project, it offered to provide some items for free and some at a discount. \u201cIn the end it came to $1,400 for the 30 pouches without me even having told her that this was the figure I\u2019d raised. I thought that was a miracle.\u201d The pouches were presented to the paediatric nurses in the memory of baby Santa. \u201cSince then all the nurses have been given the same things by another business over there because they were a bit jealous of the paediatric nurses,\u201d Mahlberg says with a laugh. Our conversation ends with Mahlberg on a train to Sydney to rescue some school desks that were destined for the dump. They will now be shipped to Sri Lanka. Mahlberg ought to be exhausted but she insists, \u201cThe joy of giving gives you so much without realising it. I don\u2019t think we realise how spoiled we are in Australia, because our expectations are so high. We do not appreciate what we have until we see what other countries do not have.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
