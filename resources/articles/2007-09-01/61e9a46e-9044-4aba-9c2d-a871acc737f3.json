There is no foreboding but this could be the key episode in Steve McClaren's tenure. Should he win, England will be well placed to qualify for the Euro 2008 finals and the first phase of the manager's work will be on the verge of fulfilment. This game will try him. Though the Russia squad is less highly esteemed than McClaren's, that partly reflects the glossy marketing of the Champions League and the prominent English sides who take part in it. That was no deterrent to an under-publicised Croatia, who top group E and beat England in Zagreb. Even if Russia do have defects, they employ a manager with a genius for obscuring them. In his latter incarnation as an international coach, Guus Hiddink took South Korea to the semi-finals of the 2002 World Cup and Australia to the last 16 of the 2006 event. The responsibility is on McClaren to be impeccable in the tactical planning for this evening's game and the onus is all the greater following the failure of Owen Hargreaves, the defensive midfielder, to get over a thigh injury. The England manager may have been speaking in the interests of obfuscation when he depicted the game in contrasting, if not contradictory, terms. \"Teams,\" said McClaren, \"don't like the way English players play and the way they're always in their faces, playing with a high tempo, being strong.\" This sort of breast-beating oration has rung out before several debacles in the past few decades. McClaren knows that and, in reality, just wants to hold on to the dynamism witnessed against Israel. He appreciates that visitors who have conceded one goal in Group E will not panic if England get a bit macho. Indeed Russia have the speed to capitalise on the break should men like Vladimir Bystrov get a clear run. England are set to stick with the line-up that terrified Israel but the instructions will differ. \"They are very mobile and very fluent,\" said McClaren of Russia. \"We might have to tweak things tactically.\" While Gareth Barry worked expertly with Steven Gerrard on Saturday, he is not a specialist in the defensive midfield role that is largely occupied by Nigel Reo-Coker at his club, Aston Villa. Barry, however, can cover and may sit deeper, considering that Russia should have one of their most significant performers, Andriy Arshavin, attacking in that area. McClaren can guess as to the net effect of his and Hiddink's strategies. \"I think there will be very few chances,\" he predicted, \"but I expect us to win.\" The England set-up is likely to have Emile Heskey continuing as Michael Owen's partner in attack. There was an option to reinstate Peter Crouch, after suspension, and the record shows he is a far more regular scorer than the Wigan player. None the less Heskey brings out the best in Owen. The manager was resistant to the suggestion that Crouch would be a better focal point. \"I saw evidence of Heskey holding the ball up very, very well on Saturday,\" said McClaren. With so much ahead of him, the manager was entitled to savour the relative calm he is enjoying at the moment. He feels the sluggish start reflected a lingering dejection over the 2006 World Cup. In that context McClaren stands with Steven Gerrard in regarding the tormented 3-0 win away to Andorra as a landmark. \"Steven became an inspiration for England that night,\" said the manager. \"I know he has done it in the past but that night he was special and everyone followed. There was a great determination afterwards and a great togetherness despite all the criticism. There is a real renewed vigour among everyone.\" In adversity England have retreated into the comfort of 4-4-2, but McClaren would argue the positioning of various individuals makes such a description the roughest of guides to what is a more flexible system than it appears. A formation, in any case, should exist primarily to liberate talent. \"The key thing on Saturday was the fluidity of our play and our movement. We've given Steven Gerrard the freedom to be our inspiration and to give us what he gives Liverpool week in and week out.\" Much as the manager will pray for Shaun Wright-Phillips to maintain his form and for Joe Cole to sparkle, a lot rests with Gerrard and Owen. Managers come and go, but the dependence on proven international footballers does not alter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
