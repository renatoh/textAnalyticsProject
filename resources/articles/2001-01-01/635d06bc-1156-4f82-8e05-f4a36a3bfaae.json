According to one report, Eriksson has already agreed to resign after another defeat on Sunday, at home to lowly Napoli. At a meeting with Eriksson at lunch-time, the Lazio president Sergio Cragnotti was reported to have asked the coach to quit. The pair then agreed a pact: Cragnotti would support Eriksson for the rest of the day but Eriksson would announce his resignation today, citing the poor run of results and the fans' loss of confidence in him. But yesterday evening Eriksson, after gaining the backing of some of his key players, met Cragnotti at the president's house to try and convince him that he should stay and that he could get the team back on its feet. Cragnotti agreed to think about it and give his answer today. But it appears that the Lazio vice-president and former Italy manager Dino Zoff yesterday signed a three-year contract to replace Eriksson as coach. Certainly Lazio's tone had altered noticeably after yesterday's meeting. Whereas before they had firmly put down and been rather offended at speculation that he might leave early to take up his England post before the due date of July 1, yesterday the reaction was far more ambivalent. \"Eriksson can stay with the team if he wants to,\" said Cragnotti. \"It's up to him.\" In another interview the president talked about the situation staying as it is \"for now\". And later he added: \"We've discussed what happened yesterday. I can only say that for our part there is no news.\" The \"for our part\" only increased speculation that there may be yet some news from Eriksson. Lazio may have decided to delay the announcement because they did not want to see it splashed across the papers on the club's 100th birthday today. Yet Zoff, who is the club's vice-president, was uncharacteristically bold in flying his colours. \"If they asked me, I would be available to help the team to the limit of my abilities,\" he said. In any event, the Football Association must be hoping that the current situation does not continue for long. It controversially appointed the national side's first foreign coach on the basis of his international success. But Lazio's slump - five wins in their past 12 games in all competitions - has put a dent in his reputation. Lazio lost 2-1 at home to Napoli on Sunday. \"The players still had Christmas cake on their feet,\" said Cragnotti pointedly. For the sake of England's chances in their crucial World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Albania in March and against Greece in June, the FA would like Eriksson here as soon as possible. The FA's chief executive Adam Crozier still intends to meet Lazio and Eriksson this month to firm up details of when the Swede can take up the post. Privately, though, he would surely like this meeting to become unnecessary. Yesterday the FA's executive director David Davies preferred to remain diplomatic. \"We want Sven-Goran Eriksson to do well and we are disappointed when Lazio do not win,\" he said, and added: \"Adam Crozier will be meeting with them in the next couple of weeks and we will attempt to resolve any uncertainty about the future.\" According to sources close to the club, the Lazio hierarchy do not blame Eriksson for the mess; the coach can do little about injuries to key players and lack of form from others. The fact that the Italian champions have just pur chased the former Manchester United winger Karel Poborsky and will sign Udinese's Italian international midfielder Stefano Fiore next week suggests that all hope has not yet been abandoned of turning the season around. Replacing the coach in mid-season is not an easy task in Italy, where they are allowed to coach only one club per season. One of Lazio's preferred candidates, Marcello Lippi, is ineligible under this rule. But personal pride aside, Eriksson must be starting to wonder whether he needs the hassle. The fans are increasingly on his back, and the atmosphere at the club is growing more fractious by the day. Recently, at the Lazio training ground, when a TV crew tried to film club officials taking down a banner telling Eriksson to go, one club official attacked the camera crew. He later apologised. On Sunday, Lazio fans and the police fought with visiting supporters. Eighteen people were hospitalised. Napoli fans' cars were attacked and at least one burned. Coaches carrying Napoli fans were also attacked. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
