One would bet that despair, dislocation and terror are their bag. Their debut album was called The Horror. Nevertheless, older listeners coming to them fresh will find themselves transported directly back to the mid-80s, and the voice of John Peel announcing that he\u2019s got something new on the Blast First label that he thinks you\u2019re going to like. There are primitively pummelling drum machines, guitars that screech and wail, droning synths and a singer, Chris Bug, whose voice is all sneers and yowls and snarls. Which is not to say Way Station, their fourth album, isn\u2019t rather good, for all its familiarity. And it\u2019s not all ear-rattling: the single Under Duress, introduced by piano, has a certain delicacy, albeit that the duress in question refers to the manner in which a confession is extracted. Sometimes it\u2019s a little overwrought \u2013 even the title of Home Sweet Hole has one thinking someone\u2019s been trying a little too hard \u2013 and this kind of calculatedly brutal music is only ever unsettling if you\u2019ve really heard nothing like it before. But when the mood is captured just so \u2013 the instrumental The Deserter; the spindly and contorted Leading the Spider On; the way Hospice switches from its juddering industrial-blues verse to a chorus that soars gothically and gracefully \u2013 you can suspend your disbelief and wallow in the misery."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
