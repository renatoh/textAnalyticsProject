The 22-year-old world championship leader initially refused to let Alonso by at the start of the final 15-minute qualifying period, despite instructions to do over the team radio. Alonso retaliated by later deliberately impeding Hamilton in the pit lane, preventing him from setting another hot lap. Although the reigning double world champion qualified on pole, he was demoted to sixth following an investigation by race stewards. The two drivers were then involved in a bitter disagreement as to who was in the right and wrong after qualifying, with their feud degenerating into silence. Hamilton, however, now claims he and Alonso are again on speaking terms, with plans to clear the air further before the next race in Turkey in a fortnight's time. \"For the record, Fernando and I are fiercely competitive and respectful of each other,\" said Hamilton. \"We are both ambitious drivers who want to win. However, we are not drivers at war, as has been widely reported. Although we did not speak on Sunday, we have spoken since the weekend and continue to have a professional working relationship. In fact, Fernando and I plan to meet up over the holiday period.\" McLaren have also made it clear there was no bust-up over the radio between Hamilton and the team principal Ron Dennis at the end of qualifying. McLaren insist they have reviewed radio transmissions and \"can categorically confirm Lewis did not use the f-word at any time during any conversation with the team.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
