Since she is importantly responsible for his success, she deserves a substantial share of the profits, especially as the judge seems to think that he can't be trusted to manage very prudently the \u00a31m or so he makes every year. The implications of this case are much more than financial. If we accept the idea that a footballer's wife has more brains and sense than her husband - and it has an alarming plausibility - much history will need to be rewritten. The team that won the World Cup for England in 1966 has, up until now, been counted as 11 men. That is, quite literally, half the story. We need to revise the myth to bring out the role played by women in the team's success. Without Mrs Stiles, the two Mrs Charltons and Mrs Moore, all Mrs Ramsay's efforts might have been in vain. It would be unwise to claim that before he met Mrs Stiles, Mr Stiles had all his own teeth, but her role in his success should not be underestimated. Fairness, however, demands that if women who raised the standards of their husbands' play are rewarded, then those whose husbands failed should suffer the consequences. In this, Sir Alex Ferguson is more of a feminist than the Guardian, since he seems to have blamed Mrs Beckham for practically everything. But why stop there? If the job of a footballer's wife is to help him grow up, then the logical consequence of the Parlour case is that George Best ought to sue all the wives who have failed to stop him drinking."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
