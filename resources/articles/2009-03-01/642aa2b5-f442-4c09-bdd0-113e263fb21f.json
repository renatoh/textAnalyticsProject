Not literally. That makes me sound like a dodgy cabbie. I just meant I'm here till 1am. And it's all in a good cause: are you sitting in a bath of beans? No, of course you're not. That's much more Children In Needish, isn't it? Sorry. I am wearing head to toe velcro, though, so hopefully that will count for something. 10.02: \"You need ... a tub of talcum powder and a bottle of baby oil\" says Carol Vorderman. Oh, well if it's going to be that kind of party I would have worn a prettier hat. The girls and the boys return to tell Alan Carr and Fern Brittain what made it work for them (or not) ... and while the women place all their good fortune on the fact they lacked bitchiness (ha), the boys just put it down to bad luck, and the fact that Alan Sugar's a bitter little man who looks like a Thunderbird puppet. I was hoping they were going to wheel them on so they could explain how this year's CR Apprentice was going to provide a huge donation to go along with the rest. I am still waiting. Davina returns, to tell us about maternal mortality rates in Malawi. 11.05pm: Oh god. Five minutes in and I'm distraught. Take a pre-menstrual woman of child-bearing age and show her a heart breaking film of orphaned babies and dying ones, and you'll probably have a gibbering wreck on your hands within a couple of minutes, whether it's being presented by Davina McCall or not (thoughto be fair, she does this well, and people connect with her, so ...) Hang on, I need to go and stop this silly girl-behaviour. Tears indeed. What must you all think. And also get my UK credit card, and go the the Comic Relief donation page, which is here ... and remember to tick the gift aid box. 11.11pm: Adele sings a pretty song, and there's footage of cute babies and mothers and such. Which is all well and good, but there's not much you can say about it ... 11.18pm: It's the inevitable Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant sketch. This time: The making of The Office: The Opera, and the attempts of the producer to get Ricky Gervais's permission. A producer of The Opera goes to see Gervais, finds him eating an enormous Turkey leg, he doesn't do charity, he says, it's always about people saying 'Please sir can I have some more', etc. And that they should just give him money, or some such, because he's such a brilliant actor. \"What would you say to a small group of critics who would say that you're NOT a good actor, that you're the opposite of a good actor, in that your most famous character, David Brent, is not really about acting, since he basically is You.\" Trying then to prove that he is, after all, the versatile actor some might claim him not to be, Gervais attempts to prove he can take any line, from any film, play or TV show: and do it in a Reading accent. When it comes to the opera, however, it seems to be rather good. Or at least as good as most operas I've ever seen. But it is not to be. Ricky only communicates from atop his Segway by whispering in Merchants ear. \"Ricky Gervais wants to know why everyone's singing everything because that wouldn't happen in an office.\" Etc. And so the opera is off, and in its place, one about Boyzone, or that mini-Boyzone that followed them. To do so, a visit to Louis Walsh in his office, where we find him in a Jacuzzi, and see not one, but three seperate depictions of his naked penis. And when we all come BACK from feeling a little ill, we discover the running total to be \u00a341, 799, 343 Crikey. But in other news: Gervais sketch this year - genius or not-genius. It's always the question. 11.26pm: Some anonymous person has donated \u00a36,000,000 to Comic Relief. Who wants to be the first to claim it is them? 11.28pm: It's Al Murray, Pub Landlord. Al Murray, Pub Landlord is having a pub quiz, peopled by celebrities - or Phil Daniels, Lamar from Fame Academy and someone from \"So give generously - it's as easy as being punched in the face by Simon Le Bon. Or at least someone pretending to be him.\" 11.32pm: And - straight from there into a film I believe was on earlier. \"This is the true story of a little boy.\" says Fern \"His parents gave us permission to film him. Because this is the truth of Comic Relief: lives are in the balance\" And we watch as a tiny boy, riddled, ssays the voiceover, with malaria, slips into a coma and dies. \u00a35 buys a mosquito net that can save lives. That donation page was here. 11.35pm: The Royale Family: a new minisode, mostly concerned with Jim Royale and his man-flu. \"How bad is it mam?\" \"Well earlier, he asked me to put the heating on.\" \"Oh no!\" Believe me, the noise of any kind of head-cold, snuffles, squidginess and all, is far, far worse through headphones via the iPlayer than most things you can imagine. It sounds quite a lot like angry slugs having an orgy. Interestingly, Ma Royale says that earlier she sprayed round with the Febreeze and that for dinner Denise had a delicious Fray Bentos steak and kidney pie. I know product placement has been comprehensively decided against, but it would be quite nice if they could give a donation to charity for those lovely mentions, would it not? 11.40pm: 118 mentions of Jim Royale's sweaty balls later, the minisode is over. Next: The Apprentice firing, finally. But first: Danielle Lloyd talks about her personal experience of domestic violence. 11.44pm: I can't deny to not usually having time for Danielle Lloyd, that would be a lie: but it's clearly a very difficult thing for her to talk about, this violent relationship she was in: and it's an important thing to be talked about - especially with the Rhianna/Chris Brown ongoing story, messages about violence within any relationship at any age are going to chime with younger viewers, hopefully. Often domestic violence stories concentrate on older couples and much more established relationships: whatever you think of Ms Lloyd, the photographs shown of her after her attacks and the difficulty she has talking about it are resonant. Sorry, I'll get back to the silly bits. 11.50pm: We're waiting on the Apprentice firing, but first ... Rory Bremner and his ilk phone people while pretending to be other more famous people. With hilarious consequences. Then Catherine Tate arrives in Granny-wear and swears a bunch. The audience are rolling in the aisles with mirth, while Fern and Carr stand by her sides looking questionably amused. But first: Little Britain and Robbie Williams, and let us remain upbeat and charitable, for charity it is, no matter how much we may dislike either or both of those elements. 11.55pm: Ellie Grace and her little friend Candy-Marie Candy are having a sleep over, and, over the breakfast table, are playing a game of \"I love you more than ...\" Including mentions of cupcakes, butterflies, and ... oh, I wish I could tell you, but then that might ruin the punchline. And I really don't think I could do that. 12.00am: I apologise if I'm slightly behind you all on iPlayer, as I fear I might be from your comments (hello! Thank you for comments!) The Annie Lennox gets another showing, and it's very sad. Annie Lennox is very annoying, though. If there was a number to call to make Annie Lennox go away, I would ring it. But more important than her is the story about a little boy born with HIV/AIDS and dying of TB. When we get back from the film, Fern is finding it difficult to speak through her tears. 12.05am: A couple of major celebrities! Jennifer Anniston! Owen Wilson! Simon Cowell and that woman I thought he'd broken up with a couple of months ago! No, not live: just recorded saying the number. Possibly a couple of months ago, depending on how up to date I am on the status of Simon Cowell's relationships (NB: not very) FINALLY: The Apprentice final 12.13am: Saint Nick, the Blessed Margaret and Surallun are having serious debate about who might deserve to be fired. They were glad Gok hadn't been brought back in, as he did the design of the presentation etc, and was very good at it. They seem to be glad Jonathan Ross didn't come back, as overbearing and annoying as he was. Alan Carr is outside talking about how he's never been fired. \"I've had them say 'Perhaps it's better if you don't come in on Monday' - is that the same thing?\" Yes it is. Back in the boardroom, Jack and Alan Carr are trying to convince Surallun that he's made a mistake, and it's not too late to bring some people back. \"Who?\" say the board Well, the girls, obviously. They make an extended argument against the velcro suit - and, it must be said, bounce off each other commendably as a comedy duo, I look forward to seeing them on half a billion radio comedy panels in the coming year alone. But eventually... 00.15am: Faced with a miserable Jack Dee and a silent Gerald Ratner and the ever-bouyant Alan Carr (seriously, does he float? Do we know? Can we check?) Surallun fires ... Alan Carr - You're FIRED! For being too happy, as far as anyone can tell. Which seems a bit harsh. 00.23am: Surallun says thanks to the others, for all the time and energy they've contributed to Comic Relief, and then that is it. I remain confused. I know it might seem trite, wishing it was one those years where the task revolves around celebrities handing over large cheques of their own money to attend events or buy donuts ... and in the comments Blythy argues against that being what people neccessarily want to see in the currrent economic climate. But I disagree. I think that when celebrities are on television encouraging us to give some proportion of however much or little we earn to charity, the question of how much THEY earn and how quickly they could increase the total is always going to come up. And I don't deny that they probably are donating a lot more than their time ... but that's all behind the scenes, and things like the event-based Apprentices are always a way of demonstrating that and ... Oh, we could argue about this all night. But now there's a film about mental health issues and I'm going to get upset again instead. 00.26am: Still to come: Mitchell and Webb and Armstrong and Miller. And Kate Moss, Sadie Frost and Katy Brand. But first: death! No, not really. First: Harry Enfield, Paul Whitehouse, and the Victorian Dragons. 00.29am: \"James Caan and Duncan Crapper have underestimated the fact that people might want to stick their bums out of the window and poo in the street\" Which sums up the Victorian Dragons sketch. One of my favourite bits of it, though, is watching James Caan trying not to corpse before being led out of the Den-Attic hand in hand with Duncan Ballantine. Meanwhile I'm still thinking about the Mental Health Issues film, and agreeing with Lisa101 in the comment box: it should have been on earlier. It was a brilliant and powerful film. 00.34am: Though it stretches out the gag a a little long, the first sketch - the RAF one - by Mitchell and Webb and Armstrong and Miller (and, topping it off, the brilliant Geoffrey Palmer) is the first thing so far to make me laugh out loud, and loudly at that this evening. And what is more, the only thing I'll be showing someone later, comedywise. And I'm not ashamed of it neither or nothing or shit. And that. Which will make no sense to anyone who hasn't just seen it. Sorry. 00.43am: After another Davina McCall film about maternal mortality rates, a return to Mitchell and Webb for the end of the Sir Digby Chicken Ceasar sketch, so anyone who thought that was it and went to bed, you are missing out on Armstrong, Miller and Keely Hawes from Ashes to Ashes drinking piss. You're welcome. That's what we're here for. 00.48am: \"We should work together after this\" says Alan Carr to Fern Britton. \"Yes, I'll get my people to talk to your person\" says Fern. It's almost one and the dialogue's starting to sound like the best exchanges from the TV awards presenters. But they're doing well, and, you know, all for charity and hell, they're running out of time so there's always the chance we'll hit 1am and not have time for that Kate Moss sketch, so I'm not going to knock it. They can go on as long as they want. As long as they can keep giving totals like this one: \u00a354, 690, 437 Which is bloody loads. Hurrah. 00.57am: 6 minutes until one o'clock, a fair chance I might be able to switch off before I have to watch Kate Moss doing acting, and a nice band called The Scripts have just turned up to sing a song. They're singing Heroes. You know, by David Bowie. There was also a bit about Subway, the American sandwich chain, and how much money their customers had donated. A camera crew went down with a choir and banners to thank the customers buying sandwiches at one of the outlets. \"Thanks, but we just arrived states yesterday, we don't know what this all about!\" said one bemused tourist. To which I can only say: you've been in the country one day and you're eating at Subway? We can COOK, you know. Tut. Thanks for the donation, anyway. It's one minute to 1am. No sign of supermodel acting yet. I'm totally watching that clock. 1.00am: I was advised that at 1am, the comedians turned into pumpkins, with the exception of Kames Corden and Matthew Horne, who would turn up at that point to show comedy clips. Instead, however, there appears to be a drag Can Can troupe and Graham Norton (in drag). Worth sticking around? Let us give it a few minutes at least ... 1.05am: Graham Norton looks good in drag - although, weirdly, cross-eyed. Ok, I'm sticking around for the last part of Victorian Dragons Den, just to check it out. But then. THEN: I'm off. 1.09am: For those of you who've chosen to go to bed and worry you've missed out on the strongest Victorian Drangons sketch. Worry not. Highlight: Paul Waterhouse doing his Stavros-like Theo Paphitis impression in front of Theo Paphitis; and then Theo doing it himself. Basically: good, but not quite as good as the other bits. And, you know, you deserve your sleep. You've has a hell of a week. 1.15am: \"Let's Dance for Comic Relief - X Rated!\" is what Norton's promising ... but it sounds like that's not upcoming until at least after the Moss, Frost and Katy Brand sketch ... and that's just one step too far. Yes, I will do anything for liveblogging. But I won't do that. \"That\" in the sense of 'watching Kate Moss act'. So, with that, and with only a handful of insomniacs left in the comment box and a not-very-funny redubbed Western on the screen, I will thank and leave you. You to your beds and me to my tea. Thanks to all the commenters who've dropped in their observations about the sketches, films and issues in this evening's telethon, And with that, I'm off. On behalf of Jack and Heidi and I, thank you, and good night, and don't forget where that donation page is: It is here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
