Owen Sheers takes real contingency plans for this alternative outcome to the Second World War as the premise for his first novel, Resistance, and creates around his imagined history a credible and moving story of loyalty and quiet courage. With the menfolk away fighting in the resistance, into a Welsh valley comes a German patrol who take over one of the empty farmhouses as a base under the command of Captain Albrecht Wolfram. In this remote occupied territory, suspicion and fear shift almost imperceptibly into a tense and grudging mutual dependence as the soldiers and the women learn to look beyond what they have been conditioned to see in one another, to 'glimpse the man behind the uniform', as one of the women puts it. The true heart of the novel is its strong sense of place, this border country edged with hills that allow both parties almost to forget the war that pits them against one another. The barren beauty of the landscape works on Albrecht to restore a sense of hope after five years of bloody warfare, and it is thanks to his restored sense of decency that the women of the valley are spared the usual ravages of an invading army, yet he remains uncomfortably aware that war, and history, have their own momentum: 'He knew he was right, in what he remembered of the real world, to be walking away from the farm woman as they were now. And yet he felt wrong, as if he'd denied the war its natural course, disturbed the calibration of events.' The young 'farm woman' is Sarah Lewis, whose letters to her absent husband, Tom, are threaded through the narrative as the distance increases between what she writes and what she feels. As Sarah and Albrecht edge gradually nearer to each other, desire and kindness are reignited in all the confusion of what constitutes fidelity and betrayal - to one's country or to another person, as resistance takes on a more personal meaning. Sheers has published two acclaimed books of poetry and his language, particularly in the descriptions of landscape, is resonantly beautiful and weighted with all a poet's care. Though his characterisation is assured, I was never entirely convinced by the relationship between Albrecht and Sarah; perhaps, in spite of the original backdrop, the idea of a shared humanity and respect bridging the divide between wartime enemies feels too well-trodden. Some of the sub-plots rather slow the novel's momentum too, but Resistance remains an impressive debut and confirms Sheers as a writer whose talent encompasses a variety of literary forms."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
