Have we fallen out of love with the TV talent show?", "bodyText": "The X Factor: Battle of the Stars, Simon Cowell\u2019s 2006 attempt at a celebrity singing competition, was less of a reality format, more a spine-chilling fever dream hosted by Kate Thornton. It featured tabloid perennials James Hewitt and Rebecca Loos doing a very entrapmenty rendition of Baby, It\u2019s Cold Outside and scatological dietician Gillian McKeith singing I Just Want to Make Love to You. Shortly after it aired, Cowell admitted it had been a huge mistake. \u201cWe are never going to do it again,\u201d he told the Sun. \u201cThe show was pointless. The ratings were good, but what we\u2019re supposed to be looking for is a new artist. The only validity for doing these shows is that I\u2019m doing my day job on TV, which is finding artists for the label. So when I\u2019m judging celebs, I\u2019m not actually doing my job, I\u2019m just being on TV.\u201d Cowell made the right call. The original non-celeb X Factor did become more than a TV show, creating huge acts such as Little Mix and One Direction and serving as a light-entertainment bulwark against the coming tides of streaming and social media: grannies would phone up to vote for the pretty crooners (pouring their pension funds into ITV\u2019s coffers in the process) while millennials would ensure its zeitgeist status by posting ironic bon mots about Wagner\u2019s hairline. By 2010, the viewing figures for these shows were unprecedented. Established acts from Whitney Houston to Rihanna began lining up to perform in between the hopefuls, making them both talent competitions and a kind of Top of the Pops on steroids. It wasn\u2019t just a British success story, either: for much of the 21st century, singing competitions have ruled the world. From Lebanon\u2019s Star Academy to Myanmar Idol, they have tended to be among the most popular shows in whichever country they are shown. Formats such as ... Got Talent, which made an unlikely star of Susan Boyle, managed similar ratings successes by slightly tweaking the same formula. But the past five years has seen a rapid decline in the TV talent show. Ratings in the UK have fallen off a cliff (X Factor is now regularly beaten in the ratings not just by Strictly Come Dancing, but also Countryfile and Antiques Roadshow), and the shows are impotent in their ability to make stars. Things have gotten so bad that, 13 years after his first attempt, Cowell has put The X Factor on hiatus and launched a new star-packed version in its place. If anything, X Factor: Celebrity is even shoddier than Battle of the Stars. At least that had household names: this time we are treated to David Hasselhoff\u2019s daughter and the woman who played the non-speaking role of the little girl in the school concert in Love Actually. Cowell has had to admit defeat, give up being a pop svengali and return to \u201cjust being on TV\u201d. How did it come to this? Pop Idol, the progenitor to X Factor, arrived seven years after Britain\u2019s first Saturday night National Lottery draw, but both inventions promised to fundamentally change the life of one extremely ordinary person. We never got to follow the journey of lottery winners, but as talent shows developed, they managed to perfect the telling of a rags-to-riches story. To watch Alexandra Burke go from singing unremarkably in a carpeted conference room to wearing a ridiculous frock and weeping into Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s bosom, as she did when the pair duetted in the series five final, was to see Charlie win the golden ticket. As Burke said to Beyonc\u00e9 that night, through bubbles of tears and snot: \u201cYou made my dreams come true.\u201d Burke\u2019s triumph was the endpoint of a journey in which Brits saw television not only as something to watch, but to take part in and triumph over. \u201cIn the 70s and 80s you see the decline of authority figures and the rise of the everyman,\u201d says Dominic Sandbrook, historian and author of The Great British Dream Factory, an analysis of how pop culture has evolved in the UK. \u201cAt precisely the moment the political culture was challenging social-democratic paternalistic politics, there was a huge surge of TV quiz shows that made the audience the star. There\u2019s a definite link between that sort of telly and the talent shows that Simon Cowell does, which is all about celebrating a kind of ordinariness.\u201d However, in 2019, neither part of the rags-to-riches journey still exists on TV. Any performer with a modicum of talent is already a microcelebrity \u2013 potentially racking up millions of plays on YouTube or TikTok, the music-based social media site, which is basically a never-ending edition of Britain\u2019s Got Talent. Normal people can self-start their career, rather than waiting for gatekeepers to give them the green light. \u201cTo be sort of humdrum is now disgraceful; instead of ordinariness we celebrate extraordinariness, it\u2019s much more about projecting an image of glamour,\u201d says Sandbrook. \u201cWhereas, in the 80s, the people who were on Bullseye, it would not have occurred to them not to be humdrum.\u201d At the same time, these shows are no longer able to offer genuine stardom, mostly because the family-friendly pop acts that talent shows are searching for no longer dominate the music industry. 2017 X Factor winners Rak-Su could only manage a chart position of 39 for their first proper single after leaving the show, 2016\u2019s Matt Terry only reached 51. The Voice UK has never launched a successful pop act and the BBC\u2019s most recent attempt at a singing competition, the since-cancelled All Together Now hosted by Rob Beckett and Geri Halliwell, could only have been enjoyed by the demons from The Bad Place. Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw, who loved those One Direction-era X Factor series, describes the format in its pomp as the \u201cmost uniting TV experience of our lives ... It got friends and family together like a weekly national holiday\u201d. He was such a fan that he became a judge on the 12th series, but feels that the talent show will struggle to whip up that level of excitement again. \u201cI think the main issue is that people can discover their own pop star whenever they want on social media,\u201d Grimshaw says. \u201cFinding someone in their own environment is much more charming. You\u2019re up close and personal with them, it\u2019s their song choice, their aesthetic and their voice. That vital teen demographic who worshipped X Factor a decade ago have changed so much. They\u2019re tech-savvy now and don\u2019t want to be told what is or isn\u2019t for them.\u201d Grimshaw says there is an ever-widening gap between the singers being produced on TV and those he plays on his radio show. \u201cTake two of the break out stars of last year, Billie Eilish or Lewis Capaldi. They\u2019re talented songwriters, but they offer their fans more. Billie does her own artwork, directs her own videos and both engage in social [media] on such a human level you actually think you\u2019re friends with them. That\u2019s something seemingly impossible to capture on a primetime talent show. \u201d Not only can these shows no longer make contestants stars, but increasingly they are being seen as ruining their lives. The X Factor has been widely criticised for placing vulnerable people in the spotlight during its audition process. Little Mix\u2019s Jesy Nelson, one of the show\u2019s great success stories, says that she would rather have never have auditioned after the horrifying levels of trolling she received (although that hasn\u2019t stopped Nelson, along with her bandmates, launching a new BBC talent show to find a boy or girl band). In response to these concerns, there has been a flurry of \u201ccredible\u201d talent shows, seeking to find authentic talent in an inherently inauthentic way: a reality show audition process. They try to square that circle by relying on the credibility of an established star to anchor them. As well as Little Mix\u2019s show, there is Rhythm + Flow, Netflix\u2019s first major talent competition, which stars Cardi B and Chance the Rapper as judges; Timbaland\u2019s show for budding teens called The Pop Game on Lifetime; Eurythmics\u2019 Dave Stewart\u2019s US format Songland, where budding songwriters compete each week to have a musical guest record their song (a version is coming to Channel 4 later this year); and ITV\u2019s upcoming The Masked Singer, an enormous hit already in the US, which takes the emphasis away from who gives the best performance, and instead focuses audience attention on guessing which celebrities are performing from inside elaborate costumes. Rappers Krept and Konan, along with 1Xtra\u2019s DJ Target, have moved away from the glitz of Saturday nights with BBC Three show The Rap Game UK, which makes a pitch for credible MCs. Ricky Cooper, who commissioned the series, says its success will not be defined by record sales or viewing figures, but whether it is respected by the UK rap community. To do this it has tried to avoid the gloss and truth-massaging normally present in talent shows. \u201cWe had one objective: to make a series that the diehard fans of British rap music would get behind. If they felt the show wasn\u2019t credible, or felt filtered, they\u2019d never buy into it.\u201d But as much as these new efforts promise in their promotional blurbs to reinvent the talent show, they often return to the televisual language created by Simon Fuller on Pop Idol almost 20 years ago. They have not managed to launch a successful music act yet, either. We are witnessing the death of a narrative that has had a stranglehold on Britain for almost two decades: that Simon Cowell can change your life. We are still waiting for a talent show that embraces the more complex world we live in. Watching Martin Bashir belt out Nat King Cole\u2019s LOVE in front of a bemused Louis Walsh doesn\u2019t capture the cultural zeitgeist of 2019, but it is a clear sign that Cowell should find a new job.
