With an increasing number of children living apart from their fathers, the Nuffield Foundation project studied why one in five fathers lose touch with their children within two years of a break-up. It found that fathers who are actively involved in bringing up children before a separation are more likely to keep in regular contact with the child after splitting with their partners, although seeing less of girls than of boys. Money played a major part, with dads who had a spare room for their children to stay over keeping in touch more. A key finding from the research[pdf] \u2013 which looked at heterosexual couples who were married or living together but split before the children were 11, leaving the children with the mother \u2013 was that women suffered a sharp drop in confidence after a separation, with a much worse view of their own parenting abilities than those who stayed in their relationship. Professor Lucinda Platt of the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and Dr Tina Haux from the University of Kent conducted the study. \u201cWith such high rates of separation in the UK,\u201d said Haux, \u201cthere has been a lot of interest in the negative effects a split has on any children involved. Policymakers have been keen to encourage meaningful contact between non-resident parents \u2013 who are mostly fathers \u2013 and their children. \u201cThe effect of a separation on a mother\u2019s parenting capacity has also become an area of concern,\u201d added Haux. It was likely that the shock and trauma of the split itself was behind the confidence slump, with the associated risk of depression in women and of slightly worsening behaviour in children. While past research has shown a recovery over time in a mother\u2019s mental health, the Nuffield study showed that mothers who had been separated for longer did not show higher confidence in their own competence compared with mothers who had recently been through a split. Whether the father was still in contact or not made no difference to the way in which the woman judged herself. Platt said: \u201cWe can conclude that being a single mum is tough and those trying to support this group of women should recognise that a focus on mental health alone may not be enough to help them get back on their feet and provide a happy, healthy home for their child. Practical, as well as psychological, support around parenting is likely to be key. \u201cThere was a clear link between separation and a knock to a mother\u2019s confidence in her abilities as a parent.\u201d The researchers made use of the Millennium Cohort Study, a UK-wide group of 19,000 children born between September 2000 and January 2002. Focusing on those where there had been a separation and where the mother remained the main carer, they looked at 2,800 families and found that eight out of 10 fathers who were separated by the time their child was three had at least some contact with their child over that period. That rose to nine out of 10 fathers who separated when their child was older. However, as time passed three in 10 had lost all contact with their dad by the time they were 11 and a quarter saw them multiple times during the week, whereas around one in five saw their child occasionally, but less often than every week. Among fathers who had separated by the time their child was five, 73% had their child to stay overnight at least occasionally. This figure rose to more than 80% of fathers who were newly separated when the child was 11. Half of those had the child to stay overnight \u201coften\u201d. Being a more involved dad \u2013 changing nappies, reading and playing with them \u2013 before a separation didn\u2019t make any difference to contact being maintained, but was linked to more frequent contact and overnight stays. The younger the child and the more time that had passed, the greater the likelihood that there was no contact, regardless of how involved the father had been. Fathers were just as likely to lose contact with a boy as a girl, but boys had more frequent contact with their dads and stayed overnight more regularly. Haux said: \u201cThe more closely involved a dad is in the upbringing of his young child, the more likely he is to have regular contact in the event of a separation. The sorts of activities a dad is involved with in the early years matter. For policy, paternity leave policies may have payoffs in terms of contact, while support for a father to meet more regularly with his child and provide a bedroom for them could also be important.\u201d The findings come ahead of a report to be published this week by the fatherhood campaign group MenCare. The State of the World\u2019s Fathers will look at the disparities in the time that men and women spend caring for their children. It argues that gender equality won\u2019t be achieved until men fully co-parent. Chief executive of the single parents charity Gingerbread, Fiona Weir, said: \u201cThese findings underline just how important it is that single parents get the right support, not only immediately after separation, but throughout. There is plenty of research which shows that single parents are doing a great job, but we know that government cuts are putting them under significant strain \u2013 not just financially but emotionally. \u201cWhile services like Gingerbread\u2019s \u2013 which offer practical support and the opportunity to connect with other single parents \u2013 do make a difference, it can be hard to feel like you\u2019re doing a good job when you\u2019re struggling to pay the bills. The government needs to take responsibility for removing the barriers the UK\u2019s two million single parents face.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
