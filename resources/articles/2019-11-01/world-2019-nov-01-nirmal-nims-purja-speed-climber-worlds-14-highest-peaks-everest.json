But for the man himself, the climbing was \u201cthe easy part\u201d. Speaking to the Guardian from the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, Nims said the real challenges were the logistics and fundraising. Perhaps most difficult of all was the diplomacy required to persuade the Chinese authorities to open the last mountain on his list, Shishapangma, which was closed to climbers for a year. Nims, a former Gurkha and British Special Forces member, completed the final ascent of his gruelling challenge earlier this week. Along the way he assisted in several dangerous rescues of stricken climbers, risking his own project. If there was a final issue for Nims to overcome, it was, perhaps, the least tangible: a widespread disbelief that he could really do it, despite having climbed Everest, Lhotse and Makalu in five days in 2017 and \u201cfeeling fine\u201d \u2013 the experience that persuaded him that he could do this challenge. \u201cNo one believed it could be done. Some people made a joke out of it,\u201d he explained, comparing his ambition to the recent successful efforts to run the world\u2019s first sub-2hr marathon. \u201cThe main thing is to believe in it. That you can give 100%. But in all honesty the most emotional moment was when we succeeded in persuading the Chinese to open Shishapangma just for our team. \u201cAfter I climbed the mountains in Pakistan [including the world\u2019s second highest, K2, and Nanga Parbat] I flew straight back to Nepal and went to work on persuading the Chinese to let us climb on Shishapangma.\u201d That including lobbying the Nepalese government, as well as climbers from around the world, to intercede. \u201cIt was crazy, but I made it happen. It\u2019s part of my Special Forces training. You\u2019re taught to come up with a solutions, not look for excuses.\u201d For Nims that included selling his house and resigning from his job in the Special Boat Service, after the Royal Navy said his ambitions were \u201ctoo risky\u201d. The achievement, however, has not been without controversy. Mountaineers have criticised Nims for using supplementary oxygen above 7,500m and fixed ropes. The Everest luminary Chris Bonington suggested Nims\u2019 achievement will eventually be seen as a \u201cfootnote\u201d in mountaineering history. But it has also been celebrated, not least by Reinhold Messner, one of the world\u2019s greatest ever mountaineers and the first person to climb all 14 8,000m peaks. He described it as a \u201cunique mountaineering achievement\u201d. In the brutal world of high-altitude mountaineering, in which climbers have been known to pass stricken fellow mountaineers without offering assistance, Nims drew plaudits for twice risking his own life to help others. The first time occurred while descending from Annapurna on 23 April \u2013 a few days into his effort \u2013 when he led a rescue of fellow climber Dr Chin Wui Kin, who had been separated from an accompanying expedition and left without food, water or oxygen for 40 hours. He later died in hospital. Less than a month later on 15 May, having made it to the summit of Kanchenjunga in just 21 hours, Nims and his team rescued a further two climbers from a height of 8,400m, sacrificing their own supplementary oxygen to the climbers in need. \u201cFor me it\u2019s not about ego,\u201d he said, explaining why he would put himself and his project at risk. \u201cIt\u2019s about principles. You can\u2019t call yourself a climber and not help in that situation.\u201d For most non-Himalayan climbers, Nims first came to wider international attention earlier this year, when a picture he took of crowding on Everest\u2019s summit ridge went viral. Although he describes arguments that took place among climbers trying to ascend and descend through the bottleneck, he said he was personally \u201cnot fazed\u201d by the experience, despite being slowed for hours on his summit day. He hopes too that the international attention now focussed on his climbs will bring a higher profile to Nepalese mountaineers whose efforts are too often eclipsed by media coverage of western climbers. \u201cNepalese guides get forgotten in the story often. Let\u2019s give credit to Nepalese climbing. I hope what I have done can come to be seen as an example of what can be done and what is possible for Nepalese mountaineering.\u201d For the future, he has his eye on one of the great remaining prizes of 8,000m Himalayan climbing: a winter ascent of the world\u2019s second highest mountain and the only Himalayan giant not yet climbed in that season, Pakistan\u2019s K2. Nims said he would not be surprised if someone climbs the 14 mountains faster. \u201cRecords are made to be broken. Someone one day will come along and be stronger. People are only limited by their imagination. If you don\u2019t dream then you won\u2019t do it. Human beings are capable of doing amazing things.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
