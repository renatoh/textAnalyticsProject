Remainers have moved on", "bodyText": "Why didn\u2019t Jeremy Corbyn go to Glastonbury this year? Couldn\u2019t he find his wellies? Was it too late to hire a yurt? Or is he hiding from Remain supporters? Again. When Corbyn attended the festival in 2017, preaching to the euphoric masses, it turned into a veritable Glastonbury on the Mount. Are members of that 2017 crowd a little embarrassed now \u2013 too much whooping, weeping and \u201cJez-mania\u201d and not enough scrutiny? When Corbyn had cancelled appearing at Glastonbury the previous year, straight after the referendum result, the official line was that he was \u201cfocusing on the issues\u201d. No one thought to ask why the rent-a-protest Labour leader, usually never happier than when air-punching at a mic stand before uncritical throngs, was suddenly too shy to appear before a massive festival crowd of hyper-emotional Remain voters needing reassurance? Three maddening, mendacious, slippery, gormless, prevaricating years later \u2013 even after polling data emerged saying that, contrary to popular thinking, there appeared to be a majority of Remain-Labour members and voters \u2013 Corbyn remains the invisible man of Brexit. Ask him a straight question and the bandages unravel, spool on to the floor, and you\u2019re left staring at nothingness. Oh, some say, but it\u2019s very hard for Jeremy, what with all those tricky Leave territories, blah blah, blah. To which the only logical response is: diddums. Isn\u2019t this Corbyn\u2019s actual job \u2013 hasn\u2019t he had 36 months to do it? There\u2019s also the small matter of personal integrity. But never mind that now, because Labour might have zombie-walked into a whole new problem: Remain-irrelevance. I\u2019ve long been anti-Corbyn for reasons beyond Brexit (antisemitism, anybody?). However, even I\u2019m confounded by the sheer arrogance of Corbyn behaving as though all Labour has to do is eventually (grudgingly) support a people\u2019s vote and all would be forgiven. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m seeing in the (many) Remain groups I\u2019m a member of. Time was, the Remain vote was such a cheap date that Corbyn would only have to vaguely hint at backing a second referendum and the knickers would fly off. Not any more. These days, when Corbyn comes out with his \u201cdefinitely/maybe/people\u2019s vote\u201d guff, the majority groan, jeer or say they no longer trust him and won\u2019t vote for Labour. Worse, sometimes people don\u2019t even react or care. Remain supporters have learned how to live without Labour. It\u2019s a marked change from even six to nine months ago. Corbyn appears to have made the exact same mistake he accused New Labour of \u2013 taking decent, loyal voters for granted until they can stick it no more. For the Remain-minded \u201cmany, not the few\u201d, Labour reluctantly \u201ccoming around\u201d to supporting a second referendum won\u2019t cut it any more. There would have to be unequivocal official support, sustained wooing and crawling, maybe even the removal of a tainted, unpopular leader. (Along with music festivals, that\u2019s another thing Team Corbyn has been avoiding \u2013 a new leadership contest.) As for Glastonbury, of course Corbyn didn\u2019t go this year \u2013 he knew he\u2019d be soundly booed. Joan Crawford\u2019s child abuse should never be a laughing matter How strange to think that a terrorised child could ever be considered amusing? Christina Crawford, 80, has been publicising the stage musical version of her 1978 book, Mommie Dearest, her account of her abusive childhood at the hands of her adoptive mother, the Hollywood star Joan Crawford. Crawford, an alcoholic with mental health problems, would punch, slap and strangle Christina, forcing her to do endless chores. Christina stresses that the musical is different to the high-camp 1981 film version of Mommie Dearest, starring Faye Dunaway. She also says that, today, her mother would be arrested. Well, quite. The climate was very different when Christina was a child, but things had barely improved by the time the book was published. Her account was disputed by Crawford\u2019s Hollywood cronies, and she was widely criticised for being disloyal \u2013 almost as though her mother\u2019s star-power cancelled out the abuse. While drag artists have lampooned Mommie Dearest (ironically, and with Christina\u2019s blessing), the straight world isn\u2019t blameless. When the film was released, audiences reportedly laughed outright at certain scenes, such as Crawford disciplining her young daughter with coat hangers. It now seems inconceivable that cinema audiences would laugh at a small child being terrorised. Christina Crawford could be justified in feeling badly treated, first by her sick mother and, later, by an even sicker public. Give kids, and parents, a break from dodgy GSCE marking Will the GCSE pain ever stop? Exams are already stressful; now there is news that the marking system could be unreliable. A whistleblower, dubbed \u201cthe secret examiner\u201d, has revealed how marks can wildly vary in English language papers and how, often, it\u2019s only because the papers are checked by a second examiner (improving the grade) that pupils are marked correctly. In this case, it was AQA, but in the past other exam boards have been implicated in marking anomalies and there have also been leaks of exam papers. The AQA whistleblower said that pupils were being \u201cbetrayed\u2019 and it was a \u201cshit storm\u201d, not exactly the kind of \u201cEnglish language\u201d you expect to see from an examiner, but I appreciate his honesty. Then again, do I? This is the last thing British parents want to hear as we move into July. Parents who have children taking GCSEs, like me, have had the entire year taken up with those exams. I haven\u2019t seen my kitchen table in months \u2013 it\u2019s been buried under books, files, laptops, half-drunk mugs of tea and crumb-strewn snack plates. The results are due in August, so July is the \u201csacred time\u201d, where frazzled students stagger forth to make the most of their newfound liberation and parents can start drinking again. Next thing you know, there is news that your child\u2019s paper might get marked too low. Or too high, which is obviously fine. Give us a tiny break. And yes, I do mean the parents. Come August, who do you think will be on the phone, inquiring about weird exam grades? One hears about university grade inflation, where apparently spoilt students stamp their feet to get marked higher, but who could blame them when this sort of thing is going on at GCSE? \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
