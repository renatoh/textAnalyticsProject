Conditions are likely to be against one, two or perhaps even three of the favourites to be fielded by John Gosden on this card but they are no obstacle to Cracksman (3.50), who can shore up his reputation in the Champion Stakes. Some cutting things have been said about this four-year-old since his defeat at Royal Ascot, partly inspired by Gosden\u2019s seeming reluctance to return him to the track. The fitting of blinkers does not exactly inspire confidence. But the fact remains that he has won two top-class races this year. True, 10 furlongs on fast ground exposed the limits of his speed when he was last seen; still, there was no disgrace in being bested by Poet\u2019s Word, who won the King George next time, and the likelihood is that Cracksman remains a serious talent. He will be fresher here than Crystal Ocean and perhaps that may also help. 1.25 Long Distance Cup As was noted this week by Timeform, it\u2019s half a century since the Gold Cup winner completed a full season undefeated. Stradivarius could achieve that feat here, having won all four races since reappearing in the Yorkshire Cup in mid-May, but there must be some concern that the flashy chestnut does not really want such a testing surface. He coped fairly well to be third last year when he was getting the three-year-old allowance from the first two but was still a bit below his best and may be vulnerable again. Flag Of Honour\u2019s best form has also been on a sounder surface, so perhaps Sir Erec is the way to go, for all that he seems Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s second string. A scopey type, he was really impressive in a Listed race on bad ground at Limerick last weekend, finishing powerfully after being trapped behind a wall of rivals. 2.00 Sprint Stakes It\u2019s asking a lot for a horse to win both Haydock\u2019s Sprint Cup in September and this race the following month, for all that they are very similar races. No horse has done the double since Ascot\u2019s Champions Day was created, though placed horses from Haydock have won here. With that in mind, Brando must be of interest at roughly double the odds of The Tin Man, who beat him by half a length in the Haydock race. A Group One winner in France last year, Brando has had another fine year, having also been second in the July Cup. He is ridden for the first time in years by Jamie Spencer, poor Tom Eaves having broken a leg since his last race. 2.40 Fillies and Mares Stakes As with Stradivarius, there must be a concern about Lah Ti Dar\u2019s ability to cope with this surface, which is radically different from anything she has so far encountered. That by itself would stop me from taking a short price about her, but there are also some interesting, improving sorts ranged against her. Kitesurf is just about the pick and, although she must also prove herself on soft, her odds offer more margin for error than the favourite\u2019s. There was a lot to like about the way she ran down Magic Wand in France last month and her run style suggests the mud may help her by slowing up those ahead of her in the first mile. Aidan O\u2019Brien fields six and his Broadway is priced up as a no-hoper but this half-sister to Danedream has been crying out for this distance and could run into a place. 3.15 QEII Stakes Once again, punters will be offered short odds about a John Gosden runner for whom soft ground is not ideal. Distance is also a factor for Roaring Lion, who steps down to a mile, having been beaten in his last three races at that distance. At least that means he will avoid the worst of the ground, on the round course, and perhaps he is classy enough to win anyway, but I would rather bet that one of his 14 rivals can mug him. Happily will do for me, having won back to back Group Ones on deep ground last autumn. She went down by just a head to Laurens a fortnight ago, when her rival had the rail to help her, and this softer ground may help her to an even better performance. 4.30 Balmoral Handicap A disappointing favourite at Haydock last month, Mitchum Swagger may have needed that first run for half a year and the drying ground was against him. A good third behind Addeybb in the Lincoln, he would at least go close here if able to reproduce that effort on just his third run since joining Ralph Beckett."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
