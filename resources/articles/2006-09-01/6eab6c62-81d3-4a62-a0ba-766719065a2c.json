She works part-time, splitting her week between sessions on the treadmill at Waltham Forest Gym in east London and looking after her two young children. She says the thought of getting back into work a year ago seemed impossible. Five years of living in temporary accommodation and not knowing where her family would end up living had left her \"depressed and demoralised\". \"When you're on your own and in temporary accommodation, it's difficult to know where you're going to be from one month to the next,\" she says. \"I wasn't even considering getting a job because I've got two young kids and I want to make sure their lives are as stable as possible.\" Playa is an East Thames housing association tenant. She was one of the first families to sign up to the Working Future project, a joint initiative between East Thames, the Greater London authority, and three London boroughs: Waltham Forest, Redbridge and Newham. The project was devised as a two-year pilot designed to help 100 households living in temporary accommodation to return to work. At the time of the project's launch, 71% of families housed by East Thames were unemployed. \"Our motivation was to improve the opportunities for homeless families in temporary accommodation, to find and sustain work or training,\" says Samantha LaTouche, the project's service manager. High rents are often a major barrier to finding work for those in temporary accommodation. Since most is leased from private landlords, families living in short-term housing are often faced with rents of between \u00a3200 and \u00a3300 a week, making it impossible to come off housing benefits and re-enter the job market. \"When you think that families in long-term social housing are paying between \u00a380 and \u00a390 a week, then the gap really emerges. The impact of such high rent can be a real economical and psychological barrier to many thinking about getting back into the workplace,\" LaTouche says. To tackle the benefits issue, households participating in Working Future get their rent reduced to the equivalent social housing levels. The initiative also provides advice about additional benefits that exist to assist those moving from welfare to work, as well as help sourcing childcare. Lack of childcare, lack of qualifications and training, and the cost of childcare were the other most common barriers to work that residents highlighted. With this in mind, Working Future supports clients who want to return to work with the necessary training and qualifications. Playa received CV and returning to work skills. \"Before, I was really worried about the thought of going into a job, why they'd want me in the first place and how I'd manage the workload,\" Playa says. \"Now it gives me a real buzz earning my own money and not being 100% reliant on state benefits.\" LaTouche says boosting self-esteem has been a major aim of the programme. \"The training aspect is important,\" she says. \"A major barrier to re-entering employment is a lack of confidence about having the proper qualifications or experience. So we try to find training programmes or NVQs that get people on to the right path.\" Now entering its second year, the pilot scheme has 158 participants; of these, 80 are in some form of vocational training and 20 have found full- or part-time employment. LaTouche says the scheme is likely to get rolled out across other London boroughs and is being considered as a national model for housing associations. Meanwhile, Playa is determined to get her family out of temporary accommodation and into their own home. \"I never thought I'd get back into work and I have. So maybe other things are possible too.\" \u00b7 Email your comments to society@theguardian.com.
