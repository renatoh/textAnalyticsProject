Those doctors have ancestry in regions including Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Even allowing for the overrepresentation of BAME staff in the NHS \u2013 they comprise 44% of medical staff compared with 14% of the population of England and Wales \u2013 the fact that they were all from ethnic minorities was \u201cextremely disturbing and worrying\u201d, the BMA chair said. \u201cAt face value, it seems hard to see how this can be random \u2013 to have the first 10 doctors of all being of BAME background,\u201d Dr Chaand Nagpaul said. \u201cNot only that, we also know that in terms of the BAME population, they make up about a third of those in intensive care. There\u2019s a disproportionate percentage of BAME people getting ill. \u201cWe have heard the virus does not discriminate between individuals but there\u2019s no doubt there appears to be a manifest disproportionate severity of infection in BAME people and doctors. This has to be addressed \u2013 the government must act now.\u201d As well as the 10 doctors, three out of six nurses named as having died have also been BAME as was a hospital pharmacist and at least one healthcare assistant. The overall death figures in the UK have not been broken down by ethnicity but early research published this week showed that 35% of almost 2,000 patients in intensive care units were non-white. Nagpaul said BAME health professionals were understandably concerned about the deaths of their colleagues and what it might mean for them. The BMA chair said it might be too early to get firm answers but that it needed to be investigated. Among the factors he speculated could be contributing was whether BAME doctors felt less able to complain about inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) \u2013 a recurring complaint among healthcare workers during the crisis \u2013 thereby putting themselves in danger. \u201cBAME doctors often feel bullied and harassed at higher levels compared to their white counterparts,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are twice as likely not to raise concerns because of fears of recrimination.\u201d He said the death of BAME doctors was particularly upsetting because of \u201cthe vast majority \u2013 I think only one was born here \u2013 who have come from overseas and have given their lives to the NHS, to save the lives of others\u201d. Among the wider BAME population, he suggested the fact that many were in key worker roles, combined with their living arrangements, could be contributing to their disproportionate presence in intensive care units. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a high proportion of BAME people not able to stay at home, serving the nation, putting themselves at risk,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you add that to overcrowded and multigenerational occupancies, the infections can be brought back home and spread to other members of the family.\u201d Nagpaul questioned whether enough was being done in terms of translating information leaflets about Covid-19 and physical distancing for people for whom English is a second language, suggesting mosques and temples could be used by the government to help relay the message. He said difficulties speaking English could lead to problems accessing NHS 111 either online or on the phone. Nagpaul also highlighted the higher prevalence of diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease among BAME communities than in the white population, adding: \u201cPrevious inequalities will be greater at a time of crisis. This [coronavirus] may be bringing into focus historic inequalities facing BAME communities.\u201d He said the best advice for BAME doctors to protect themselves against Covid-19 until more was known about the virus was the same as for any of their colleagues: ensure they are wearing appropriate PPE. He urged them not to risk their life if it was not forthcoming. \u201cWe need to safeguard our BAME population and the BAME medical officers,\u201d he said \u201cThese are workers who are already experiencing significant hardships working for the NHS. They are serving the nation at a time of unprecedented crisis. The government must take steps to address this.\u201d The Department of Health and Social Care said it was working hard to protect all communities, adding that translations of the public information leaflet, posted to all 30 million households in the UK, were available on its website."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
