Several decades later this pretty and versatile summer squash is now firmly ensconced in our vegetable racks, so much so that it seems taken for granted. Yet it deserves so much more than a quick toss round a frying pan. Its delicate buttery flavour lifts the richness and complexity of a good ratatouille with a beautifully fresh top note. The freckled green discs can be used to add a visual slap and tickle to the staid gloopiness of a risotto; roasted with olive oil and a generous handful of thyme; stuffed with tomato and garlic, and finished with a parmesan crust. The repertoire is endless \u2013 they can even be turned into jam. They really are the most obliging kitchen resident. There is none of the struggle and ingenuity required to deal with its older sister, the marrow. Courgettes slice so easily that preparing them is all pleasure. True, in the garden they have an inclination to take over and become a bit thuggish. No matter \u2013 a firm hand is all that is required. Just one plant in a 24cm pot full of good compost, fed and watered without restraint, will reward you with a steady supply of wonderfully stuffable orange flowers and almost as many courgettes as you can eat. In recent years courgettes have extended their repertoire to include round varieties and brilliant yellow \"banana\" courgettes. Such a clever vegetable \u2013 what's not to love?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
