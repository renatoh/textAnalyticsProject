One: he wanted to be an entertainer. Two: he would never come out of the closet. Only one of those predictions proved to be true. As a teenager who blasted SoundCloud rappers in his headphones and spent all his free time scrolling through Twitter, Lil Nas X quickly learned that it was easier to blend in than risk being different. He knew people who had come out at high school, and saw the pain, bullying and homophobia they experienced. He told himself he wasn\u2019t cut out for it. So he dressed in his cousin\u2019s hand-me-downs and, when he could afford them, purchased safe, muted clothes from Zara and H&amp;M. He watched fashion shows on his smartphone, but never thought he would be brave or rich enough to wear such explicitly queer outfits. \u201cThe honest truth is, I planned to die with the secret,\u201d Nas says now of his sexuality. We meet two weeks before the California lockdown, and he digs into the plate of spicy fusilli in front of him, a quick lunch at a West Hollywood restaurant after the Guardian photoshoot and before his afternoon power nap. Hesitant and shy at first, he becomes increasingly playful as our lunch goes on. Today he\u2019s dressed in a matching, traffic cone-orange Heron Preston denim combo \u2013 a contrast to the soft, Edwardian-esque outfits he modelled hours earlier, strutting shirtless in a flower crown while belting out Doja Cat\u2019s viral hit Say So. Was that really his plan, I ask, never to be himself? \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that changed when I became Lil Nas X.\u201d Today, 20-year-old Lil Nas X (Nas to his friends) is a far cry from his teenage self, Montero Lamar Hill from Lithia Springs. In 12 months, he has gone from \u201cthe black cowboy with the song on TikTok\u201d to a global superstar. He is simultaneously a Gen-Z success story, red carpet fixture, Billboard record holder and, perhaps most surprising to Lil Nas X himself, a queer figurehead. The key to this success has been his track Old Town Road, an infectious blend of hip hop and country, right down to lyrics such as \u201cRidin\u2019 on a tractor/Lean all in my bladder\u201d and \u201cCowboy hat from Gucci/Wrangler on my booty\u201d. The crossover hit was embraced by everyone from Rolling Stone magazine to teens on TikTok, prompting Lil Nas X to quickly release a version featuring country titan Billy Ray Cyrus, known to one generation for his 1992 hit Achy Breaky Heart, and another for being Miley\u2019s dad. \u201cEverything seemed like a dream or a movie,\u201d Nas says of his whirlwind 2019, culminating in six Grammy nominations, including best record for Old Town Road and best album for 2019\u2019s 7. \u201cIt was like the world was playing a prank on me.\u201d Just two years ago, he was a silly, meme-loving 18-year-old who was still figuring it out. He slept on the floor of his sister\u2019s apartment and was about to drop out of college, giving up on the computer science major he half-heartedly pursued at the University of West Georgia. One day, while procrastinating over his course work, he wrote his first song. The track, Shame, saw Nas lean into the rough-edged, macho qualities of the rap styles he grew up listening to: Drake, Lil Uzi Vert and Rae Sremmurd. \u201cIt was just me acting really hard,\u201d he admits. \u201cWhich I did a lot of in the beginning. Because it felt like that\u2019s what I had to do.\u201d He took on a straight persona for those early songs, lewdly rapping that he \u201cmight go and fuck ya motha\u201d on the unpolished and unmixed track Nasarati, formerly available on the rapper\u2019s SoundCloud page. Merely mentioning the song makes him cover his face in embarrassment, hiding his high-beam smile, and shaking his head. \u201cYou heard it?\u201d he says when I point out that nothing on the internet ever truly disappears. \u201cOh goddddd.\u201d He is currently recording his first proper album (he considers 7 to be an EP), and after a year of talking about Old Town Road says he\u2019s tired of answering the same questions. \u201cYou know, \u2018What was it like working with Billy Ray Cyrus?\u2019\u201d he drones, rolling his large, hooded eyes. \u201cIt was great, by the way,\u201d he quickly adds. For better or worse, these questions will not stop any time soon. The song was made in a $20-an-hour studio, on a laptop with a beat found on YouTube (which illegally sampled Nine Inch Nails\u2019 track 34 Ghosts IV). Nas had already amassed a 20K following on Twitter, with an account mainly known for memes and jokes. When he posted the song there, his life would change dramatically. \u201cCountry music is evolving,\u201d he wrote, finding a video of a cowboy riding a bull to accompany the song. Old Town Road took off on the video-centric TikTok, soundtracking clips of teens shedding their suburban attire for cowboy hats and boots, and switching seamlessly between square dancing and hip hop moves. The genre was dubbed \u201ccountry trap\u201d and quickly charted high on the Billboard Hot Country Songs list. Then Billboard stepped in and yanked it off the chart, claiming the track lacked the necessary \u201celements\u201d of the genre, without specifying what those elements were. Many accused Billboard\u2019s decision of being rooted in racial bias. White artists have long borrowed sounds from black rappers, infusing their music with an \u201curban\u201d edge, with little to no pushback from genre-based music charts. It felt like the epitome of hypocrisy. But the outrage that followed Billboard\u2019s decision only helped boost Old Town Road\u2019s popularity. The Billy Ray Cyrus collaboration hit No 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early April 2019, holding that position for 18 more weeks and beating the previous record (held jointly by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men for One Sweet Day; and Puerto Rican artist Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber for Despacito). A year later, Nas says he still struggles to understand why Old Town Road prompted the kneejerk reaction from Billboard\u2019s country purists. \u201cI think maybe it leaned too much on the other side for them,\u201d he says, adding that because his earlier music features more traditional rap sounds, they assumed \u201cOh, this is him? Then this is all he\u2019s allowed to do.\u201d The predictable outcome of all this would have been for Lil Nas X to remain a one-hit wonder, enjoying the flash-in-the-pan success of Rebecca Black\u2019s Friday and Psy\u2019s Gangnam Style as the internet moved on. Instead, he has grown into the rare kind of pop star who is able to appeal to multiple demographics. Kids love him for his tunes and fun dances (as proven by a video of Nas visiting an elementary school, where the pupils shriek in pure glee as they dance to Old Town Road). Meanwhile, the fashion crowd appreciate his bold, gender-bending style; conservatives in the south vibe with his cowboy persona; and LGBTQ+ fans relish the much-needed, intersectional representation he provides. It was after performing to a crowd of thousands at Glastonbury with Miley Cyrus last summer that, amid increasing speculation about his sexuality, Nas decided to come out, casually, in a tweet. \u201cDeadass thought I made it obvious,\u201d he wrote, accompanied by a deluge of rainbow emojis. \u201cThere was nothing really holding me back any more,\u201d he explains today. In coming out, Nas joined a growing cohort of young entertainers challenging the idea that queer rappers cannot experience mainstream success, from Kevin Abstract of hip hop \u201cboy band\u201d Brockhampton, to the experimental Tyler, the Creator, to the openly bisexual female rapper Doja Cat. Grateful that the announcement hadn\u2019t killed his career, he began pushing the limits with increasingly outlandish red-carpet looks. He wore a neon-green suit, created by the hip black designer Christopher John Rogers, paired with feminine leopard print gloves to the American Music Awards in November last year. Two months later, he was at the Grammys in a leather, Barbie-pink Versace suit, with a harness and see-through mesh T-shirt. As the red carpet looks grew campier, the reactions became more extreme. Pastor Troy, a hardcore rapper, also from Georgia, went on a homophobic rant in response to Nas\u2019s Grammys look, writing on Instagram and Twitter: \u201cWelp I guess I won\u2019t be winning a Grammy\u2026 If this is what I gotta wear. They love to push this shit on our kids!!\u201d Lil Nas X shared the rant with his 4.3 million Twitter followers and wrote in response, \u201cDamn i look good in that pic\u2026\u201d Nas credits his stylist, Hodo Musa (who worked on the Guardian Weekend shoot), for his increasingly eye-catching looks. Yes, he possessed a mild interest in fashion as a teen, he says, but he didn\u2019t have an encyclopaedic knowledge of it. \u201cI\u2019m trying to \u2013 no, I will build myself up as a superstar, and fashion will be a big part of that,\u201d he says. It\u2019s perhaps strange that, unlike musicians from Troye Sivan to Frank Ocean (whose track Biking holds a top spot in Nas\u2019s playlist right now), he does not explore his sexuality in his music. \u201cI 100% want to represent the LGBT community,\u201d he says, adding that he also worries about the safety and wellbeing of fans who may grapple with the decision to come out. \u201cI don\u2019t want to encourage them to do something they don\u2019t 100% want to do. Especially in, like, middle school or high school. Because it\u2019s just super hard.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s easier for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not depending on anybody. There\u2019s no one who\u2019s going to kick me out of the house \u2013 nobody to start treating me shitty.\u201d This may not be the case for \u201canother 20-year-old who doesn\u2019t quite have it figured out and still lives with his parents\u201d. What about his own parents? \u201cMy family knows now. But it\u2019s not something that\u2019s ever brought up or we speak about. We\u2019re quiet on it. Nobody\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, you got a boyfriend?\u2019\u201d Does he want that question? He tilts his head and thinks long and hard. \u201cIt would have to be something I grew used to hearing. I don\u2019t want it to be something we never talk about. Because what about the kids in my family? I would like it to be a healthy medium between, \u2018Who are you fucking?\u2019 and just not saying anything.\u201d For the record, Nas\u2019s love life remains a mystery, despite him saying, last year, that he was \u201csomewhat\u201d in a relationship. His family \u2013 which includes seven brothers and sisters \u2013 also remains behind the scenes. \u201cI should talk to them more,\u201d is all he will say. He is not in contact with his mother, and hasn\u2019t been for a long time. When pressed on this, he becomes tight-lipped, saying only that, \u201cPeople have to be willing to help themselves first before you can help them.\u201d Piping hot mozzarella sticks are brought to our table, and he eagerly bites into one as the song Lucid Dreams plays in the background, Nas singing along softly. It\u2019s a track by Juice WRLD, a rapper who also created a massive internet fanbase for himself, before dying of a drug overdose late last year. When the news broke, Nas performed a cover of Lucid Dreams on stage. In many ways, the two young artists are sharply divergent examples of what sudden, internet-born fame can look like. Since the success of Old Town Road, Nas has had to rethink what he shares. For one, he no longer runs the meme accounts on which he mastered the art of posting viral tweets and jokes. He refuses to own up to running @NasMaraj, a Nicki Minaj fan account, despite sleuthing fans and journalists all but confirming he did through analysis of IP addresses and time stamps. When asked about being a Nicki Minaj \u201cbarb\u201d, or superfan, he gives a devilish grin and speaks into the recorder lying on the table, as if delivering a message directly to the internet. \u201cQuiet on that,\u201d he teases. \u201cUm, that\u2019s never happened.\u201d I can\u2019t quite tell what he would be embarrassed about, other than the idea of fanboying for another rapper. But Nas has to be careful of his digital footprint. He learned this lesson the hard way in February when he tweeted a glamorous red-carpet photo of R&amp;B singer SZA with a line that suggested they were dating. He wrote, \u201cclean for her. cook for her and everything i do is for her. and if she cheats? that is on me!\u201d As with a lot of memes, the joke didn\u2019t stand up to a lot of scrutiny; it was just Nas\u2019s way of heaping praise on SZA. But many took him literally. \u201cOne morning show on YouTube was like, \u2018Lil Nas X says he\u2019s not gay any more!\u2019 And it has a hundred thousand views.\u201d He worries more that when he is being serious, people will think he\u2019s kidding. Case in point: he felt compelled to write \u201cno joking\u201d before asking his Twitter followers how best to provide help during the coronavirus pandemic. He is even more cautious when it comes to politics. Last year, the first openly gay Democratic presidential nominee, Pete Buttigieg, asked him to appear in a campaign video. Nas turned down the offer. \u201cI\u2019m not too into politics,\u201d he says now. \u201cI don\u2019t know his political history or motives. The only thing I know\u2026 Wasn\u2019t he from the Democratic party?\u201d Yes. \u201cSee. All I know is he\u2019s from the Democratic party and he\u2019s gay. So it\u2019s like\u2026 I don\u2019t want to base my support off, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re gay, I\u2019m going to support you.\u2019\u201d His words are coming faster now. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re gay. But I don\u2019t know everything you\u2019re planning when you\u2019re running the entire country.\u201d He returns to eating his food, retreating back into his calm, subdued demeanour as quickly as he came out of it. \u201cBut, yeah. That was the reason I said no.\u201d Later, Nas tells me that politics depresses him. As a teenager, he closely followed the protests over police brutality and mass shootings. It frustrated and saddened him to see that nothing really changed. \u201cIt got hard to leave the house,\u201d he says. \u201cI guess ever since that, I\u2019ve tried to stay away. Politics gets me very upset.\u201d The more Nas talks, the more it becomes obvious that what he is deeply suspicious of is less politics than the individual Americans delivering it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say I support this one person because they\u2019re doing this one thing. Because I don\u2019t know what else they\u2019re doing, or what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d He says he hasn\u2019t yet registered to vote in this year\u2019s presidential election, but \u201cof course I\u2019m going to vote. I encourage my fans to vote.\u201d When Nas came out, he told his fans to listen closely to the penultimate track on the 7 EP, titled C7osure. The muffled-sounding mid-tempo ballad is all about leaving a stifling past behind for a liberated future. Lines such as \u201cI know it don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s time\u2026 But I look back at this moment, I\u2019ll see that I\u2019m fine\u201d suggest the internal conversation Nas had with himself before reversing his decision never to come out. Like any other 20-year-old, he is still figuring out who he is. He reads books about Buddhism to \u201cget a better understanding of life and how to handle things\u201d, and says he\u2019s inspired by HBO\u2019s teen drama Euphoria. \u201cI would love to do a version of that somehow,\u201d he says of the boundary-pushing show that features a trans lead, queer relationships and lots of drug use. The songs on his new album will explicitly explore his queer identity, he says; his form of social advocacy will be \u201cthrough my art\u201d. We pay the check. Nas is ready for a power nap. After that, he\u2019s attending a concert by Noah Cyrus, the youngest daughter of Billy Ray. I sense that Lil Nas X is still not done coming out to the world. He stands up from the booth, his 6ft 3in frame on full display, and says goodbye. He\u2019ll share the rest of himself when he\u2019s ready. Lil Nas X\u2019s debut EP 7 is out now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
