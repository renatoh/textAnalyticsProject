Victor Solomka was last week found guilty of money laundering and breaching immigration laws by a jury at King's Lynn crown court. Judge Nicholas Coleman QC said \"systematic failures\" within the immigration service had allowed Solomka his co-defendants - Lawrence Dell, Alexander Pianzin and Andris Cerins - to build up their illegal empire. \"This fraud had its origins in Victor Solomka's companies and, in my judgment, the systematic failures of the immigration authorities to root out what was going on under their noses,\" the judge said. Solomka is believed to have run one of the largest gangmaster operations in the UK, supplying illegal workers, who went mainly to fish factories in Scotland. He then laundered the huge profits he made via a number of sham companies set up by Dell and Cerins. Prosecutor Rupert Overbury told the court that Solomka was the prime mover in a \"premeditated, highly sophisticated and organised conspiracy to facilitate breaches of immigration law\". \"The sole motivation for those involved was personal financial gain,\" he said. \"Solomka's rewards were significant, including a house, expensive vehicles and an average weekly income of just under \u00a35,000.\" Having amassed a fortune, Solomka set up a sophisticated money laundering ring with Dell, 45, of Ely, Cambridgeshire, and 28-year-old Cerins, a Latvian. Dell, who pleaded guilty to eight counts of false accounting, claimed he thought he had been involved in a VAT scam and had no idea he was supplying Solomka with false invoices to launder the proceeds of crime. He will be sentenced at a later date. Graham Brown, respresenting Cerins, told the court he had been introduced to the money laundering scheme by Dell, and had made \u00a312,000 from the scam. Cerins was jailed for 18 months. Judge Coleman told Solomka he was a \"deceitful and manipulative\" man and that, by supplying illegal labour to reputable firms, he had not only jeopardised valuable contracts but had put hundreds of migrant workers beyond the protection of the law. Solomka was found guilty of conspiracy to facilitate the commission of breaches of immigration law and money laundering. The jury heard that, after coming to Britain as an asylum seeker in February 2000, he had set up three companies. Between 2001 and 2004, both companies were paid around \u00a35m for the provision of immigrant workers, who came to the UK from countries including Russia, Ukraine, Latvia and Lithuania. His righthand man in Scotland, Russian Alexander Pianzin, was also sentenced. The 39-year-old, of Fraserburgh, had earlier pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to breach immigration law, and was jailed for 30 months."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
