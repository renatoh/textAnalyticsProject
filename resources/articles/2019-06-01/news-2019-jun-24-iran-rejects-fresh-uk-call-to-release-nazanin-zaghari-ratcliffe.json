Andrew Murrison made the appeal for Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s release on his first visit to Tehran, where he quickly discovered the low standing with which Britain is held in Iranian government circles. Iran\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Seyed Abbas Araghchi, said Zaghari-Ratcliffe would have to serve her sentence, denouncing a hunger strike by her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, outside the Iranian embassy in London as \u201cblackmail\u201d. Araghchi said: \u201cThe Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s judiciary will not be influenced by such acts of blackmail, and those convicted of espionage must serve their terms.\u201d Ratcliffe, a tireless campaigner for his wife\u2019s release from a Tehran jail for the past three years is on the 10th day of a hunger strike in solidarity with his wife, who is protesting against her conditions in Evin prison. She was arrested in April 2016 and given a five-year sentence for espionage, a charge she denies. At times the Iranians have threatened a second set of charges. Their five-year-old daughter, Gabriella, has been deprived of her weekly visit to see her mother in jail, possibly because the Iranian authorities are angered by Richard Ratcliffe\u2019s high-profile protest. Araghchi also criticised the UK government\u2019s support for the US, saying: \u201cIt appears that the British government\u2019s entanglement with the predicament of Brexit has prevented it from having a correct understanding of the global realities. Immature companionship with America\u2019s bully-style measures will result in nothing but an increase in the Iranians\u2019 historical aversion to the UK policies.\u201d He also raised the UK\u2019s outstanding \u00a3400m debt to the Iranian nation going back more than 40 years, which is related to the British government\u2019s refusal to honour a contract for Chieftain tanks sold to the Shah of Iran in 1976, but never received. Araghchi called for an immediate settlement of the debts, stressing that the UK government\u2019s refusal to do so was not acceptable or justified. The debt issue has been a running sore between the UK and Iran, with Iran pursuing it through the courts for years only to be met with UK resistance over whether it was legally able to pay the debt to entities that were subjected to sanctions. Boris Johnson, when he was foreign secretary, once briefed newspapers that the UK had decided to pay the Iranian debt \u2013 it then emerged he had failed to win Whitehall\u2019s agreement. Murrison, on the first of his round of visits, was also given a lecture on Britain\u2019s historical interference in Iran by Kamal Kharazi, a senior foreign policy adviser to the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Kharazi told the UK minister: \u201cBritain has a very negative perception in the minds of people of Iran.\u201d He cited the first world war when the UK entered Iran and caused a famine; the 1901 agreement of an oil monopoly in the country given to William Knox D\u2019Arcy; the granting of a tobacco monopoly in 1891; the British-backed coup against the former Irainian prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953, and the support for Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war. Kharazi said: \u201cI explained these reasons for this perception and said that the British government must take serious steps to offset this perception.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
