It\u2019s been incredibly boring, and then extremely exciting. Here\u2019s Daniel Taylor\u2019s match report. Bye! Peter Crouch and Andy Carroll speak to Sky. Before the microphones are turned on, Crouch tells Carroll that he had \u201ckilled us\u201d. This is what he then told the world: It would have been a vital win for us, a massive win. Three points would give us a lifeline. A point\u2019s a massive result, but three would have done us the world of good. It\u2019s a shame, we defended so well during the game. But it\u2019s a great goal from Andy. It did kill us a bit. It\u2019s a kick in the teeth. Since the manager\u2019s come in we\u2019ve shown a lot of fight, but we\u2019ve been a little bit unlucky in places. We\u2019ve got Burnley, Palace, Swansea and Liverpool. I think there\u2019s winnable games in there. If we can win three, who knows what will happen? Statistical and analytical updates for you: The second half was a lot of fun. The first half, well, let\u2019s not speak of that. Joe Hart is bleeding from the nose, which makes a change from haemorrhaging goals, I suppose. 90+6 mins: It\u2019s over, and neither side has the three points they desperately desired. 90+5 mins: Stoke break, Ireland chips the ball into the area and Zouma, with Cresswell at his shoulder, crumples to the ground. The referee blows his whistle! For offside! 90+4 mins: Into the last of four added minutes. Can anyone strike the killer blow? 90+3 mins: This time Shaqiri\u2019s delivery is poor, the ball loops well past the far post, and Crouch\u2019s header back in is caught by Hart. 90+3 mins: It\u2019s a fine cross from Shaqiri, but it\u2019s met by a West Ham head, and Stoke have their first corner at last. 90+2 mins: Cresswell fouls Shaqiri, is booked, and Stoke have a free kick from the right wing, their first chance to threaten the West Ham goal since they actually put the ball into it. 90+2 mins: Another disallowed goal! This time Hernandez fires in, but Carroll had used his arm in setting up the chance. 90+1 mins: The ball is crossed in from the left, and lands a foot inside the penalty area. Martins Indi makes a poor attempt to stop it, and Carroll caresses a volley back across goal and just inside the post! That is a super goal from Carroll! Lovely! 90 mins: Now Crouch is playing at left-back, and booting the ball clear. 88 mins: The first thing Carroll does is go down inside the area after a tussle with Martins Indi. The referee isn\u2019t impressed, though the defender seemed to be holding Carroll back quite obviously, for quite a long time. 86 mins: And Stoke take off Diouf, who strolls slowly over from the far side of the pitch. Ireland will replace him, if and when he leaves the pitch. 86 mins: David Moyes throws on another striker, bringing Carroll on for Joao Mario. 85 mins: Stoke are defending deep and desperate, but the ball falls to Shaqiri, who flicks it over his head, draws a foul from Kouyate, and then uses up some precious time with some agonised rolling around. 84 mins: Joao Mario tries a speculative 30-yarder, which flies well high. 83 mins: Questions will be asked of Joe Hart\u2019s goalkeeping after that goal \u2013 and Gareth Southgate was in the stands to see it. 82 mins: Lanzini, just on as a substitute in place of Masuaku, takes the free-kick, and hits the wall. 81 mins: Hernandez tries to make something for West Ham, so Martins Indi brings him down. Another shooting chance for West Ham, and a yellow card for the Stoke man. 79 mins: Pieters passes the ball into the area, where Diouf spins on it and passes to Allen, who lays back to Shaqiri. It was perfectly weighted for a first-time, right-foot shot but of course Shaqiri doesn\u2019t do those, so instead he takes a touch, sets himself on his left but also gives West Ham a chance to close him down. The chance seems to have gone, but his shot from 18 yards somehow evades the defenders and flies low to Hart, who can\u2019t hold it and Crouch taps in the rebound! Stoke have only gone and scored! 76 mins: West Ham make a change, bringing Fernandes off and Hernandez on. 75 mins: Since he came on, Cameron has definitely kicked opponents more frequently than he\u2019s kicked the ball. He gives away another free kick, but this one\u2019s on the half-way line. 74 mins: Cresswell crosses this one, which is a mistake. The ball goes out for a goal kick. 72 mins: Joao Mario is tripped by Cameron, and West Ham can have another shot from the set piece. 72 mins: This one\u2019s no better. To be fair, with Zouma, Shawcross and Martins Indi in the defence headers are the one thing that Stoke can win. 71 mins: West Ham win a seventh corner. They haven\u2019t so much as won a header from the first six, but eventually one\u2019s going to pay off. 70 mins: Stoke trigger Plan B: Bauer has come off, and Peter Crouch is on. 69 mins: Now West Ham win a free kick, and Cresswell\u2019s shot is well saved by the increasingly busy Butland! 67 mins: The ball zipped towards goal through Arnautovic\u2019s legs, and though he didn\u2019t touch it, he must have completely blocked Butland\u2019s view. 66 mins: Another disallowed goal! This time Fernandes rifles the ball in from just outside the area, but the linesman thinks somebody is interfering with play! 65 mins: West Ham are having a period of supremacy, and the crowd for the first time seems involved, entertained and also awake. 63 mins: West Ham break, but Arnautovic is excellently challenged by Martins Indi. Moments later Cresswell\u2019s decent cross from the left is booted clear by Shawcross. West Ham have their sixth corner (Stoke haven\u2019t had any). 61 mins: Cameron is now on, and Sobhi has come off. 60 mins: Joao Mario scuffs a shot from the edge of the area. This game has improved so much since half-time that some people would probably now deem it interesting. 59 mins: Cometh the hour, cometh Geoff Cameron, who is currently being readied by Stoke. 57 mins: More on this evening\u2019s Bundesliga VAR madness: 56 mins: And Stoke miss a great chance! Bauer rampages down the right, bursts into the box, pulls back to Diouf and, with the ball just behind him, the striker scoops over the bar! 55 mins: Disallowed goal! Cresswell crosses from the left and it\u2019s a brilliant ball, curling and dipping onto the head of Arnautovic, who nods in from six yards \u2026 but he was just offside! 54 mins: Stoke keep the ball for a bit, until Zouma tries to pass it to Pieters and hits into touch instead. Still, the visitors have had the best of the second half so far. 50 mins: At the other end, Zabaleta\u2019s cross loops just over the head of Fernandes, six yards out, and Zouma thumps it behind. 49 mins: Pieters picks out Shaqiri in the penalty area, who controls, spins and then, with Bauer to his right, falls over. 47 mins: Sobhi is played into space on the left. He checks back. He performs a couple of lollipops. He checks onto his left foot, doubles back onto his right, and then scoops a hopeless cross into the arms of Joe Hart. 46 mins: Peeeeeeep! The game is back on, with both sides unchanged at the interval. The players are back out, and after 10 minutes spent thumping my head repeatedly against my desk I am feeling refreshed and ready for another 45 minutes of fun. Meanwhile in Germany: 45+1 mins: Noble\u2019s 25-yard shot zips into the arms of Butland, and that\u2019s the end of the first half. 45+1 mins: There will be one additional minute of Ryan-Shawcross-tied-his-shoelaces-a-while-ago time. 44 mins: Jack Pitt-Brooke (23 mins) was woefully misguided. This game is getting progressively worse. 41 mins: Chance for Stoke! Shaqiri\u2019s pass finds Sobhi running into the area from the left. He controls well, spins well, and then totally miskicks his shot with his left foot, sending the ball rolling miserably towards Hart. 40 mins: Cagey? Cagey? I can think of a different, and slightly briefer, adjective beginning with C that would be a bit more accurate. 37 mins: West Ham are starting to genuinely dominate. Kouyat\u00e9 is played in on the right, and his low cross is cleared by Martins Indi. Behind him, Arnautovic and Zouma run into each other, and the defender goes down, but the referee thinks it\u2019s accidental. 35 mins: A fine chance for Arnautovic! Zabaleta is played in on the right, nods the ball back to Arnautovic, and he hammers the ball goalwards from a tight angle, and right into Butland\u2019s shoulder. Corner. 33 mins: A shot! A proper shot on target! Sobhi flicks the ball around the corner to Diouf, who hammers it low and hard towards goal from the edge of the area, but it\u2019s too close to Hart. 32 mins: Joao Mario plays in Arnautovic, who drags his shot wide from 12 yards (and a bit to the right of goal). 30 mins: Turns out Ryan Shawcross was the man being booed, because he was doing up his shoelaces. 29 mins: The crowd is booing lustily. I\u2019m not sure why, because Sky are showing me Peter Crouch and Andy Carroll having a chat on the touchline. 28 mins: Arnautovic\u2019s fine dummy allows the ball to run through to Joao Mario, and then there\u2019s a moment\u2019s hesitation as both Pieters and Martins Indi leave the ball to each other, thereby almost allowing Arnautovic to reach the pass. But then the latter sticks out a foot and boots clear. 26 mins: I thought I might try to simultaneously liveblog the match and Karren Brady\u2019s new TV show, just to help out any conflicted Hammer (and also to make life a little more interesting), but just as I turned on ITV the first episode of Give It a Year ended. Sorry. 25 mins: Sobhi is fouled, but Shaqiri\u2019s free-kick into the box is poor, West Ham break and Arnautovic has an opportunity to make them pay, but is dispossessed as he tries to work a shooting chance. 23 mins: I\u2019m with Jack here. The only way is up. Baby. 19 mins: I\u2019d like to see them use \u201cSAVE!\u201d here, instead of \u201cSTOP!\u201d. \u201cSTOP!\u201d makes you feel you\u2019ve just been caught stealing apples from your grumpy old neighbour\u2019s garden. All I\u2019ve done is try to read a tweet. Leave me alone. 17 mins: Cresswell takes an optimistic shot, which bounces just in front of Butland and is palmed behind. The corner is eventually booted clear. 16 mins: Arnautovic tries a first-time pass to Fernandes and gets a nudge in the back from Martins Indi as he does so. The pass doesn\u2019t amount to much, so Michael Oliver blows his whistle, and West Ham have a free kick, about 40 yards out. 14 mins: Here\u2019s one person who presumably isn\u2019t watching the match tonight: 12 mins: Shaqiri, who seems a bit sulky, trips Ogbonna and gives away a free kick. But moments later he slides a pass to Bauer, whose shot is decent, but saved. 9 mins: \u201cHere at Stoke I can not exert too much influence, simply because there is a lack of quality around me,\u201d Xerdan Shaqiri said a couple of weeks back, moaning that \u201ceven a Ronaldinho could do little in this team\u201d. So far he\u2019s fallen over in a desperate attempt to win a free kick, and given the ball away twice on the right flank. 6 mins: Arnautovic runs onto Noble\u2019s long pass and from precisely the same spot from which Masuaku shot a couple of minutes ago, he tries to pull the ball back. It deflects off a defender, though, so Butland still has to make a save. West Ham win a corner, from which nothing much happens. 4 mins: And another save! Stoke zip down the other end, where Sobhi\u2019s 20-yarder is easily claimed by Hart. 3 mins: Save! West Ham are first to find their shooting boots, as a right-wing cross flicks off a head in the centre and goes to Masuaku, who seems to have taken the ball down the nearest blind alley but still manages to shoot low from a tight angle, and Butland saves with his feet. 1 min: Peeeeep! Stoke get the game started! A quick song about bubbles and we\u2019ll be on our way \u2026 They players have left the tunnel! The players are in the tunnel! We\u2019re about to get some football to watch/read about! In many ways Stoke\u2019s whole season has been an overlong trudge towards disaster, but there\u2019s an opportunity to change the narrative. Rationally, the window of opportunity closes in a couple of hours. After that, it can either be a death march, or a survival skip. Or a brief and cruelly optimism-inducing skip, and then back to the death march. This isn\u2019t encouraging: David Moyes speaks! If you\u2019d given me this position when I took over I\u2019d have said thanks very much. We can take a big step tonight if we win, we know that. They\u2019ve got match winners as well, so we have to be careful and mindful of them. And so does Paul Lambert! Well Zouma comes in for Johnson. It\u2019s the same formation, because I think we\u2019re playing well without getting the results. It\u2019s the same formation, the same lads apart from Glen. I\u2019m 100% confident [of avoiding relegation]. I don\u2019t have any stress. I know the job in hand but I\u2019ve got a group of lads that are giving me everything, and at the end of the day that\u2019s all I can ever ask for. I\u2019m not detecting a great amount of enthusiasm for this fixture. Head-to-head update: West Ham\u2019s last three home matches against Stoke have all ended in draws, and in the decade since Stoke\u2019s promotion to the top flight they have won at the Hammers twice, lost twice, and drawn the rest. So 21 of the 22 starting players also started their team\u2019s last game \u2013 the odd one out is Kurt Zouma, who replaces Glen Johnson for Stoke. On West Ham\u2019s bench, though, are Andy Carroll, who last played on 4 January, and Manuel Lanzini, who has been out for over a month. The team sheets are in, and these are the names upon them: West Ham: Hart, Rice, Ogbonna, Cresswell, Zabaleta, Noble, Kouyat\u00e9, Masuaku, Fernandes, Joao Mario, Arnautovic. Subs: Carroll, Lanzini, Hugill, Adrian, Hernandez, Evra, Cullen. Stoke: Butland, Shawcross, Zouma, Martins Indi, Bauer, Ndiaye, Allen, Pieters, Shaqiri, Sobhi, Diouf. Subs: Ireland, Cameron, Fletcher, Crouch, Grant, Campbell, Sorenson. Referee: Michael Oliver. So the title is decided, the top four have a healthy cushion over Chelsea in fifth, and Antonio Conte\u2019s side are themselves six points ahead of Arsenal in sixth. Seventh-placed Burnley are nine points clear of Leicester in eighth. As far as important top-half business goes, the Premier League season is over. Thus it is in everyone\u2019s interest, except those teams actually involved in it, to keep the relegation scrap going until the bitter end. This game is important for both sides, but the world wants, needs and deserves more important games, an entire month of them. A home win tonight would drag West Ham to 37 points and 12th place, and take them to the very edge of certain safety. Great for them, of course \u2013 particularly with four testy fixtures to come before the season-ending visit of Everton \u2013 but not for anyone else. The neutral must want as many teams as possible to go into the final day at risk of disaster, and in particular for the one fixture that day that pits two struggling-but-not-yet-completely-doomed sides against each other \u2013 Swansea v Stoke \u2013 to be a win-or-bust spectacular. A win tonight will take Stoke within an achievable four points of their opponents and within three of the Swans, and the fight will be on. Sadly Stoke\u2019s away record is the worst in the division \u2013 there has been just one win, back in October, and a total haul of a meagre eight points. There has been just one win of any sort, in any competition, in a dismal run since Christmas. Their goal difference is the worst in the division, by a distance. They have been, in short, rubbish. And yet there is hope, though Paul Lambert is aware that now is crunch time: I\u2019ve never thought about relegation. I\u2019ve just thought about staying in the league and that is still my aim. This club was built on sheer graft and hard work with a sprinkling of gold dust at the top end and we have to get that back and give the fans what was happening here before. We have to come away [from West Ham] with something without a doubt. The intent is to go and win and we will do everything we can to get three points. If we get a win it drags a few back in and that\u2019s the most important thing. David Moyes, meanwhile, appears to have been at the drinks cupboard again: The ideal situation is to go unbeaten between now and the end of the season, there is no reason why we can\u2019t do that. [There are 32 reasons why they can\u2019t do that here] Oh, and by way of added spice there\u2019s also this bloke, who scored one and hit the bar twice in a 3-0 victory on his return to the Bet365 Stadium in December: Remaining fixtures: West Ham: Arsenal (away); Manchester City (home); Leicester (away); Manchester United (home); Everton (home). Stoke: Burnley (home); Liverpool (away); Crystal Palace (home); Swansea City (away)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
