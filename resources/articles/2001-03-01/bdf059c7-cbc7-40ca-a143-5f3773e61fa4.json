Millions are sent every day, partly because they are cheap, but mostly because it is enjoyable. It is exciting to see the little message symbol on the screen in the same way that it is exciting to get a letter. It is not going to put us on the spot, in the way answering a phone call could. There's time to consider what has been sent, try to read betweeen the lines, puzzle over double meanings: do they really fancy us, or are they just being friendly? Text messaging allows almost instantaneous correspondence that we wouldn't want to be overheard on the train: what our boss is really like; what we did, or wished we hadn't done, the night before. Most importantly, text messages let us think about our reply, choose our words carefully. They let us try to say something clever or cool, use written words to strike a pose or have a calculated effect. Then the message gets sent, the words bounce around in the ether, and at the other end someone tries to work out what it means: do we really fancy them, or are we just being friendly? That gap between what we think our words mean, what we try to make them say, and what they say for themselves, is poetry. More people are using words creatively and inventively than at any time in the history of the English language. We are all poets and we don't even know it. Yet, writing text message poems is as easy as writing text messages. I started my first one, Summer Dresses, while waiting for a bus, on one of the few hot days in Leeds last summer. Since then I've written quite a few, and begun to notice what the better ones have in common. Text messages are short, so the subject has to be tackled in a way that will fit into 160 characters. There isn't space to tell much of a story. A text message poem has to find one truthful moment and describe it, whether it's seeing the red moon during the lunar eclipse - or not seeing it becaue it was cloudy; the way everyone stands up at once during a football match; a child asleep in the back of the car on the way home from a holiday. Ezra Pound called it the luminous detail. Find it, show it and let it speak for itself. Mobile phones have become workaday tools. Text messages are written in everyday words about our everyday lives. Handled with care, that's good enough to be poetry. A poem doesn't have to be written in a different language - poetry speak - just because we want it to mean something. A poem will find a meaning anyway, whether we like it or not. Different makes of phone have different sized screens, so there is no way to control how a poem is laid out to the reader. The only way to control the rhythm and pace of what is being read is by choice of words and punctuation. Text messages have developed their own shorthand vocabulary in order to save space. There is nothing wrong with using these abbreviations in a playful, inventive way, but be aware of the effect that they will have on the reader. The eye will skim across an abbreviation without properly reading the words, and so speed up the pace of what comes next and give it a breathless, must-dash feel. This will be perfect if the poem is about being late for a date, but might not be appropriate if it's about burying your little brother's hamster at the bottom of the garden. It is useful to give the poem a title. It will forewarn the reader that what is coming next is not the usual \"See you in the pub at half eight\" message. Putting the title in capitals and the rest of the poem in lower case is the simplest way to make it stand out. Text message poems have to be written on phone screens. Seeing the counter of remaining characters ticking down gives a sense of how to structure a poem so it fits. Poems written on paper then keyed in always seem to be 25 characters too long, then it's heartbreaking deciding which really good bit to leave out. Anyone can write a text message poem. They are just everyday language used carefully. This is poetry, however you write it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
