The clubs, previously perceived as sleazy and hostile, are now seen as ideal venues for a corporate night out or a bit of celebrity-spotting. Table dancers, sometimes called lap dancers, are self-employed, and, in case you didn't know, dance very close to punters whilst wearing the bare minimum. Stringfellows got its nude (as in completely) licence earlier this year, and has both male and female dancers. Working conditions for table dancers are notoriously bad, but may be set to improve since the GMB union opened a branch to represent workers in the sex industry earlier this year. Income Despite excitable press reports of four-figure nightly earnings, table dancers are just as likely to make a loss. Because many clubs charge dancers around \u00a370 to work a shift, on slow nights or in quieter venues they may not make this back. The going rate for a three-minute dance is \u00a310, a percentage of which is usually paid to the venue. The big money possible at clubs like Spearmint Rhino and Stringfellows is mainly through tips, which have topped \u00a31,000. Punters also pay up to \u00a3200 an hour for chats. The male dancers at Stringfellows do less well: it seems their conversational skills are in scant demand, with their admirers happy just to watch. Perks Table dancing attracts lots of students because of its flexible hours and the opportunity to make money straight off. It can also be combined with a day job. Most clubs have very strict house rules and an abundance of bouncers ready to pounce on punters should they 'overstep the mark'. Most clubs ensure dancers get a taxi at the end of an evening. Disadvantages 'The industry is very stigmatised, and people find it very difficult to get out of it,' says Ana Lopes of the International Union of Sex Workers. She adds that 'informality' within the business means health and safety rules are not always enforced. Dancers' contracts appear to be designed primarily to sign away their rights. 'There are really petty ways of getting money out of the girls, and there's a lack of respect from customers and other staff,' says Lisa Venes of the GMB. In some clubs dancers have to pay fines if they are late, and one dancer was fired for calling in sick. The future The number of jobs in table dancing is set to soar as Spearmint Rhino opens new clubs across Britain. The rise of the Spearmint brand - and the celebrity endorsement of it - is largely behind the new 'respectability' about the profession. It is hoped this, along with union representation, will bring about an improvement in working conditions. 'We're looking to get table dancers proper contracts, to stop the fines for being late or for wearing the wrong makeup, and to improve the shocking conditions that some of these dancers have to work in,' says Venes. My view: Lexy Lexy is a table dancer at Spearmint Rhino's main London venue. She's been there 14 months, having transferred from Stringfellows. 'If you want to study or become a singer, you'll need cash whilst having flexible hours - so this job is ideal,' says the 25-year-old. 'How much money do we earn? That's like asking \"how long is a piece of string?\" - it fluctuates so dramatically.' The clientele are generally well-behaved. 'Customers are City-working guys, famous people, couples - all kinds of people.' Lexy is happy with the working conditions: 'There are lovely dressing rooms. I can imagine that less well-known clubs wouldn't have the facilities that I have, and that the girls there would like to push for more.' Working at Spearmint four nights a week, Lexy also fits in modelling and TV work. She likes to retreat to her Essex home: 'I'm quite a homemaker - I've just bought a flat and am furnishing it. I'm a normal person really!'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
