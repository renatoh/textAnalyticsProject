The Coalition has indicated it will move to repeal the so-called medevac laws when parliament resumes next month, but will need the support of four crossbench senators to do so. One Nation\u2019s two senators and independent Cory Bernardi support the government\u2019s bid to wind back the laws, while Labor, the Greens and Centre Alliance are holding firm in support of the legislation. This means Lambie is likely to have the deciding vote. The former independent Wentworth MP Kerryn Phelps, who spearheaded the legislation, told Guardian Australia she had contacted Lambie on Thursday and would lobby her to support the medical evacuation laws. \u201cI am very keen to sit down and have a chat to her about the medical aspects and medical protocols involved and the need for this legislation,\u201d Phelps said. She said her message to the senator would be to \u201ctalk to the people who have worked on Manus and Nauru\u201d. \u201cTalk to the doctors who have put together a very robust and professional process of assessment to ensure that the requirements of the legislation are met and that these people cannot get the medical attention they need on Manus Island and Nauru,\u201d she said. The Coalition has ramped up its pressure on Labor to side with the government to scrap the laws after the federal court ruled that a doctor could assess a patient\u2019s need for a medical transfer from Nauru based on their medical file. The Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie urged Lambie to withstand the \u201cscare tactics\u201d of the Coalition, saying the bill was \u201ca good piece of legislation that is saving lives\u201d. \u201cI would like to think that Jacqui will recognise how vulnerable these people are when we already have so many reports of self-harm since the election,\u201d Sharkie said. The MP for the South Australian seat of Mayo also took aim at Bernardi for backing the government\u2019s position, while also promoting his Christian beliefs. \u201cWe should be the good samaritan here and I find it quite disturbing that after all this time we are still having such a fear campaign around this legislation.\u201d Bernardi said his position on the bill had not changed, and agreed with Dutton that the federal court ruling could make it easier for people to be transferred to Australia. Labor\u2019s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, labelled Dutton\u2019s warnings about potential boat arrivals \u201cscaremongering\u201d, insisting there was no \u201cpull factor\u201d because the laws only apply to the current cohort on Manus Island and Nauru. \u201cThis legal action was always about a clarification of the law, and provides certainty that people on Nauru can submit an application to trigger the medevac legislation and process,\u201d she said. \u201cApplicants will still be assessed by doctors, both in Nauru and Australia.\u201d But Dutton said Labor needed to change its position because people of \u201cbad character\u201d could come to Australia as a result of the legislation. \u201cIt is a bad law and it undermines border security in this country,\u201d Dutton said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
