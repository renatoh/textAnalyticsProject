No amount of post-match waffle from their manager Stan Ternent could disguise the paucity of this display against an extremely hard-working but strictly limited Millwall side. However, the Lancashire club have now gone 11 matches without defeat, and had won their previous six. Perhaps this was simply a bad day, although the impression was, having reached the top with such a splendid run, that the players had peaked, and might slip back sharply. They created very few chances and the ones that came their way were thrown away like so much junk mail. That said, there is not an abundance of quality in this division, and the draw brought Burnley to the 50-point mark, which looks solid enough for them to set their sights on the play-offs. As always there was much to admire about their approach, with the ball played to feet, and swung across the pitch with genuine freedom. But what was almost totally lacking on this occasion was any sense of urgency. It was as if they expected to score without making the commitment. Turf Moor was at its most dramatic. The snow was on the Yorkshire side of the Pennines, but there was a white glaze on the grass, and a brilliant sun which gradually dropped from view during the first half, leaving an Alpine feel to the town.The stage was set, but Burnley were unable to respond. With Blackburn Rovers and Bolton Wanderers back in the Premiership, both Burnley and Preston North End would clearly and dearly love to emulate their success, and in many ways it is a jump of faith as much as footballing ability. Both have been out of the top flight for so long that history acts as an obstacle rather than an inspiration. This was the feeling that insinuated Saturday's match, with the Burnley fans already preparing themselves for disappointment. Millwall's discipline was much to be admired, with the back four holding the line superbly, aided by a workaholic midfield in which Marc Bircham was outstanding. Burnley's two best chances came at the end of both halves. Just before half-time Millwall's goalkeeper Tony Warner knew little of a Kevin Ball shot, but Gareth Taylor fluffed the rebound. Then, with Burnley's pursuit of the winner all but done, Alan Moore hit the bar when he should have scored. Man of the match: Sean Dyche (Millwall)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
