The recent home defeat to South Korea was the second of 2010, and there have also been 0-0 draws with Venezuela and China, and a thoroughly depressing 3-0 defeat at home to Serbia's B team. The draw could have been a lot kinder too. Japan's greatest asset is a skilful midfield but the age-old issue of physical strength remains a problem. The management have set a frankly ludicrous target of reaching the semi-finals, but I'd say it would be a terrific achievement to make it through the group stage and bow out gracefully to Italy in the last 16. Sadly, I think we'll fall short of even that. Men to watch: Midfielders Shunsuke Nakamura and Yasuhito Endo have been the core of the side for the past three years, though Nakamura has been on a downward spiral since flopping at Espanyol. The real ones to watch though are youngsters Takayuki Morimoto and Keisuke Honda. Weakest link: Loath as I am to admit it, 102-cap skipper Yuji Nakazawa is starting to become a liability: his legs are going. Yoshito Okubo is another whose selection baffles me \u2013 he wouldn't even make my squad but remains in the likely starting XI . The coach: France '98 coach Takeshi Okada only returned because of Ivica Osim's ill health, and rarely shows sufficient tactical nous. He likes 4-2-3-1. Best chant: \"O\u2026 vamos Nippon! Nippon, Nippon, vamos Nippon! (Hai, hai, hai-hai-hai-hai!) Least-liked opponents: South Korea and Australia. TIPS Winner: Brazil, through Dunga's pragmatism. Golden boot: David Villa (Spain). England: Semi-finals via a world-class manager. Follow Ben Mabley at mabley.footballjapan.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
