The head of television news at the BBC, Roger Mosey, attacked his colleague in the letters page of the corporation's internal newspaper, Ariel, after Donaldson had written last week that he had thrown his copy of a new guide produced by the Making it Happen team in the bin. The Making it Happen guide was launched in January by the director general, Greg Dyke, as a means of engendering a \"culture of positivity\" among BBC employees. After countless away days and a two-day conference involving hundreds of staff the BBC came up with the new set of \"values\" that staff were expected to follow. Derided as a \u00a3250,000 waste of money by critics at the Daily Mail, the initiative resulted in a set of six \"values\" including \"creativity\" \"maintaining trust\" and \"striving for the highest quality and value for licence-fee payers\". But rather than encouraging BBC staff to sing from the same song sheet, the guide appears to have been somewhat divisive. In his letter Mr Mosey, who is also the Making it Happen team leader, castigates Donaldson, saying: \"Does he think the BBC now is perfect and incapable of improvement? \"Does he believe that all members of staff - including the 5,000 who joined in the past year are absolutely clear about our traditions , our beliefs and our aspirations? \"It's only if he can answer yes to both questions that he was right to throw his values leaflet in the bin. I'd like to think he'll fish out his crumpled copy and read it to see why thousands of people across the BBC believe this represents a way of changing the place for the better. \"It would be sad for him to remain in a sad and grumpy minority.\" Under Mr Dyke, the BBC has taken a hard line on presenters and staff who speak out against the corporation. When he was first appointed as director general, Mr Dyke warned the \"whingers\" to shape up or ship out. He also said that making the BBC a \"happy\" place to work was one of the his main missions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
