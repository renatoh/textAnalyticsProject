His red card was the game's pivotal moment Bacary Sagna 6 Most of Bayern's best attacks came down the opposite flank but his distribution was disappointing at times. Only won one tackle Per Mertesacker 6 Lucky to watch a couple of deflections fizz away from his own goal but also got in front of a couple of goalward attempts Laurent Koscielny 6 Fortunate not to concede a second Arsenal penalty when he clumsily tripped M\u00fcller but hard to fault him otherwise Kieran Gibbs 6 Evening was cut short by injury with half an hour played. Bayern focused on the right flank once he was replaced by Monreal Mathieu Flamini 7 Covered a lot of ground and was tidy. Frustrating evening was summed up by a heated exchange with \u00d6zil in last 10 minutes Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 6 Surprisingly taken off with \u00d6zil looking far less threatening. Started strongly and was never afraid to run at the Bayern defence Mesut \u00d6zil 4 Earned the penalty but his attempt was as lazy as his defensive work-rate. He was also largely disappointing going forward Jack Wilshere 7 Started in impressive fashion and his driving runs worried Bayern but his impact was reduced once Szczesny was dismissed Santi Cazorla 6 Sacrificed following the red card but battled hard. Made Neuer work from distance early on Yaya Sanogo 6 A surprise inclusion with Olivier Giroud left on the substitutes' bench but justified his selection with a lively performance. Booked Bayern Munich Manuel Neuer 7 Lethargic as the penalty was, Neuer still had to save it. Showed all of his experience to call \u00d6zil's bluff after a stuttering approach Philipp Lahm 8 Given the freedom to roam forward at will, especially after Gibbs was injured. Provided the assists for both goals J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng 5 His lazy leg tripped \u00d6zil to concede the penalty. Picked up a yellow card for his troubles and was replaced by Rafinha at the interval Dante 6 Rarely tested from the moment Arsenal were reduced to 10. Had to work hard early on but will have busier nights to come David Alaba 6 Struck the left-side post with his penalty but that mistake aside looked comfortable \u2013 even if he looked quiet compared to Lahm Thiago Alc\u00e1ntara 7 Not a stand-out player but he still made more tackles (3) than any other Bayern player and spread the ball wide with ease Arjen Robben 8 Made the most of Szczesny's challenge, leading to pantomime boos for the rest of the evening. Excellent in the second period Javi Mart\u00ednez 7 Perched in front of the back four during the first half but moved to centre-half when Boateng was hauled off. A steady presence Toni Kroos 9 Stunning technique to curl home the opening goal and was a constant menace to the Arsenal back four. Also struck a post Mario G\u00f6tze 6 Not quite as prominent as Kroos or Robben but still showed some nice touches. Failed to hit the target from four attempts. Mario Mandzukic 6 Bayern's lone striker had a quiet night, with just 11 touches before being replaced by M\u00fcller with 25 to play. Also booked."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
