The Portugal forward became the first player since Klass-Jan Huntelaar for Schalke in 2012 to score consecutive trebles in this competition but this game was also adorned with a memorable volley from R\u00faben Neves that deflated a depleted Espanyol who were threatening to make a game of it. Wolves fans are still getting used to the structures of European football. \u201cYou\u2019re going down with the Villa,\u201d they chanted at their opponents as La Liga\u2019s bottom side were dispatched with some ease. After a modest run in which they had won once in nine games, scoring just six goals, Wolves picked up where they left off in European combat in December when Jota\u2019s treble against Besiktas rubber-stamped their place in the knockout stages. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo is a manager who specialises in dampening expectations. But he understands fans who are starting to wonder whether a club two years out of the Championship could win a European trophy. \u201cThey know me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve just been talking to the boys: now we have to recover, rest and prepare for Sunday [at home to Norwich]. Then we can think about other things. But dreaming is for free.\u201d Wolves made two changes, reverting to their strongest lineup but Espanyol retained only two players from the side who drew 2-2 at Sevilla as they made survival in La Liga their priority. Abelardo Fern\u00e1ndez placed Sunday\u2019s game away to Valladolid above this match. \u201cIn view of the delicate position in the league that is the priority but I still put out a team to get a result,\u201d the manager said. With Adama Traor\u00e9 restored to the right flank, Jota won the nod to stay in the side on the left and soon rewarded Nuno\u2019s faith. Traor\u00e9 touched a corner back for the recalled Jo\u00e3o Moutinho, the cross came in promptly and Jota reacted slickly to Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s flick-on to volley home. Nine of Jota\u2019s 12 goals this season have come in this competition and he invariably makes a pest of himself for opposing defenders. How Ander Iturraspe was not dismissed for butting him two minutes before half-time after the pair grappled irritably after a throw-in only the referee, Tobias Stieler, and his VAR friends will know. Facundo Ferreyra had missed an open opportunity to equalise, goalkeeper Rui Patr\u00edcio making a total hash of volleying what he feared would be deemed a backpass from Jim\u00e9nez, and early in the second half Lei Wu got free twice only to head wide. In between, a goal of technical perfection appeared to settle this first leg. Neves does not score that many goals but when he does they tend to be spectacular. Traor\u00e9 ran at D\u00eddac Vil\u00e0 and crossed towards the far post but Victor G\u00f3mez could not have suspected what was to follow as he headed away. Neves got in front of his man, chested the ball gently down and unleashed such an aesthetically pleasing volley that many Wolves fans were on their feet celebrating even before the ball reached the back of the net. Wolves could even afford to take off Traor\u00e9 before Jota seemingly made the tie safe with two superbly executed goals. Matt Doherty played a one-two with Leandro Dendoncker before threading a fine through pass for Jota to hold off G\u00f3mez and blast home at the near post. Nine minutes from time he ran diagonally at a tiring defence before reversing a sure strike into the bottom corner. He was given a standing ovation as he was substituted and the Wolves fans acknowledged where they have come from as they sang \u201cThumbs up if you love Sir Jack\u201d in memory of Jack Hayward, their benefactor of 30 years ago when this ground was crumbling. How their horizons are rising now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
