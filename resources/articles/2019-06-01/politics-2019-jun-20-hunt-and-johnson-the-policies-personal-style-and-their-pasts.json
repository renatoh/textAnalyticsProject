What are the differences between their policies and personalities? Here\u2019s what we know so far. Brexit Johnson: He has promised to push for a new deal while insisting the UK will leave the EU come what may on 31 October, even if it involves no deal. While his hard Brexit supporters are adamant this is a cast-iron guarantee of leaving on that date, elsewhere Johnson has been somewhat less definitive. Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate last week, Johnson said only that it was \u201ceminently feasible\u201d. Hunt: He says a new deal with the EU is possible by 31 October and he would send a cross-party negotiating team to Brussels, including members of the DUP. He would countenance leaving the EU without a deal but is notably more wary than Johnson. A key moment of the BBC debate came when Hunt recalled meeting a sheep farmer who said he would be wiped out by post-no-deal tariffs. Hunt contrasted Johnson\u2019s \u201cdream\u201d of becoming PM with the fate of the farmer losing a family business. Personal style Johnson: While campaign-period Johnson has been either invisible or deliberately sober to the point of dullness, his primary draw to Tory members is a self-created sense of optimism and fun, and of not \u2013 to use the phrase endlessly trotted out against those less enthusiastic for Brexit \u2013 \u201ctalking Britain down\u201d. Much is also made of his supposed broad appeal to the electorate, evidenced by two terms as London mayor. The caveat is both that Johnson was a notably more liberal figure then and that his victories relied in large part on votes from the capital\u2019s traditionally Tory outer suburbs. In most political contests, Johnson\u2019s character \u2013 he has lost more than one job for lying, and has a complex and opaque personal life \u2013 would be a big issue, but among the Tory faithful he seemingly receives a free pass. Hunt: His style is notably technocratic, with few rhetorical flourishes and an emphasis on his consensual approach and long record as a minister, notably during more than five years as health secretary, a traditional graveyard of ministerial careers. Hunt\u2019s attempts to talk up a backstory as an \u201cunderestimated\u201d entrepreneur can fall flat given he is also the son of an admiral and was head boy at Charterhouse. Overall, Hunt\u2019s approach can seem uninspiring and hard to pin down in terms of core beliefs, hence the \u201cTheresa in trousers\u201d nickname among some Tory MPs \u2013 one that is more catchy than accurate (since May herself often wears trousers). Taxation Johnson: His main pledge has been to raise the threshold for the 40% higher tax rate from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at a cost of almost \u00a310bn a year, which would help about 3 million higher earners, a demographic with a fairly sizeable crossover into Tory members. While this has at times been styled as an aspiration (not least as it would struggle to get through parliament), Johnson backers such as Liz Truss say it is a definite plan. Johnson\u2019s camp insist it would be part of a wider \u2013 and so far unknown \u2013 package of tax changes. Hunt: Has been fairly silent on this, beyond a proposal to cut corporation tax from 19% to 12.5%, which would cost an estimated \u00a313bn a year. Even at 19%, the UK rate is well below European and global averages. Public spending Johnson: He has said relatively little on this, beyond promising a fairly small increase in schools funding and to equalise schools spending across regions, as well as talking about the need to roll out fast broadband across the country. Johnson has generally hinted he would loosen the purse strings, but given his prior fondness for big-ticket projects \u2013 London\u2019s cancelled garden bridge, the mooted \u201cBoris island\u201d airport \u2013 perhaps expect more of a focus on infrastructure projects than services. Hunt: There have been few specifics so far. Before the campaign began he called for a doubling of defence spending, but he has since pulled back slightly, saying only that it should increase. At the BBC debate Hunt called for a boost to public services, and he risked annoying May by arguing that cuts to social care budgets had gone too far. Climate and environment Johnson: This is unlikely to be a big issue for Conservative party members, and Johnson has not said much on this beyond confirming his general support for the new government target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050. Like the other candidates, when asked about the climate emergency at the BBC TV debate, Johnson had no particularly bold promises to make. Hunt: Also backs the 2050 target for zero net carbon emissions and has called for \u201csensible tax incentives\u201d to encourage green initiatives, but very little beyond this. Foreign policy Johnson: While this is also unlikely to be a big issue among Tory members, beyond vague platitudes on \u201cglobal Britain\u201d, it could be a weak spot for Johnson given his poor performance as foreign secretary, a tenure he has mentioned in the campaign notably less often than his time as London mayor. He was seen as something of a joke by diplomats \u2013 both UK and foreign \u2013 and is likely to face more questioning over his gaffe about the jailed British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, especially now she and her husband are on hunger strike. Hunt: A likely strength for him, as he has been seen as a solid foreign secretary, an impression burnished by taking over from the chaotic Johnson. This has been a key part of his pitch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
