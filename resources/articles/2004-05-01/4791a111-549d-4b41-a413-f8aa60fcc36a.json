He is refusing to resign and thereby satisfy his critics including Tony Blair, Geoff Hoon and Alastair Campbell, who said he should resign if the photos proved to be fake. And he rejected suggestions made in parliament today by armed forces minister Adam Ingram that the paper had failed to cooperate fully with military investigations into the images, which apparently show British soldiers torturing Iraqi detainees. \"We have listened to what Mr Ingram has said today, but he has still not produced incontrovertible evidence that the pictures are faked,\" Morgan said in a statement. \"Nor has he satisfactorily answered the very serious charge of why he failed to act on information about this abuse presented to him last year.\" Morgan added: \"In relation to Mr Ingram's allegation that we have not cooperated with the SIB [special investigation branch] in their investigation - this, as he knows, is nonsense. \"Although we will not provide any information which might lead to the identification of our sources, we would point out that we did provide Soldier C, a soldier who served with the Queen's Lancashire Regiment last summer and who spent six hours with the SIB last week providing detailed evidence of abuse and named those who had perpetrated it.\" Morgan said the Mirror had exposed \"a significant amount of serious unlawful abuse by a rogue group of British troops\", which would have remained unknown to readers had it not been for the paper's stories. He stuck to the paper's line that the substance of the allegations was more important than the authenticity of the images, which were originally published on May 1. \"There is, of course, a much bigger issue here that we make no apology for highlighting - which is that the pictures accurately illustrated the reality about the appalling conduct of some British troops, and in particular, the conduct of certain members of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment - conduct which is already the subject of ongoing disciplinary proceedings. And conduct which stains the reputation of that regiment and the British Army.\" Morgan said the Mirror had \"nothing but admiration\" for 99% of British servicemen and women, but his paper's stories had focused on those which had committed abuse. \"We hope the government now takes urgent action to bring the perpetrators to book, with the same vigour and speed with which they are pursuing the veracity of these pictures,\" he added. Earlier today Mr Ingram said the Mirror's photographs were \"categorically not taken in Iraq\", adding that this had been \"independently corroborated\". \"Those pictures were categorically not taken in Iraq. Moreover this is not only the opinion of SIB [special investigation branch] investigators, but it has been independently corroborated,\" he told the House of Commons today. \"The truck in these photographs was taken was never in Iraq.\" \"I said on May 4 that we were treating the photographs at face value. That value has changed,\" he added. Mr Ingram said he could not divulge full details of the investigation into the photographs because it was still ongoing. But he revealed that those involved \"may have committed criminal offences under military law\" and could face charges. He called on Morgan to cooperate and show the same \"standards of honesty, openness and professionalism\" that the Mirror expected of the army. \"I call on the editor of the Daily Mirror to assist fully. From the start of this episode the Daily Mirror demanded the highest standards of honesty, openness and professionalism. I challenge the Daily Mirror to do the same. \"It is appropriate to debate these matters today as they bear directly on the morale and safety of the men and women - regular, reserves and civilians - whom we ask to do difficult and dangerous work.\" Mr Ingram said the Mirror's refusal to cooperate fully with investigators was straining their resources, and putting the officers involved at risk. \"They [the Mirror] have not cooperated and because the investigation has not yet been completed the amount of officer time allocated to this because of public concerns... is diverting essential resources from elsewhere,\" he said. \"They are carrying out their investigations in sometimes very dangerous environments. We are putting these investigating officers at risk.\" Mr Ingram said the good name of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment had been \"dragged through the mud\" by the Mirror, and attacked it for implying that systematic abuse had taken place. \"This is unquestionably not the case,\" he said. \"Individual incidents are under investigation, and if any new incidents come to light they will be subject to the same intensity of investigation.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
