The FTSE 100 shed 5.2% of its value to close down 223 points at 4,065.5, while oil dipped under $50 and the pound fell back below $1.49 as investors anticipated a deep and prolonged recession in the UK and the possibility of more rate cuts when the Bank of England monetary policy committee meets this week. Similarly bad data on manufacturing in the US pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by 400 points and a think-tank declared its economy in recession. HSBC, Britain's biggest bank, began the jobs cull when it said it would cut more than 500 posts across the country following a review of the business and \"current economic conditions\". Despite weathering the economic crisis better than many other banks, HSBC will cuts jobs at the London head office, Leeds, Birmingham, Sheffield and Chester. It said no retail customer-facing staff in branches or call centres would be affected. Credit Suisse, the Swiss investment bank, added to the gloom when it announced that it was cutting 650 UK jobs. It has offices in London, Birmingham and Manchester. Meanwhile, Halfords became the latest retailer to suffer from the slowdown on the high street, saying it would cut about 200 posts across its network of more than 450 stores, along with 50 more at its head office in Redditch, Worcestershire. And luxury sports car maker Aston Martin said it was planning to axe 600 full-time and temporary jobs because of the downturn in the world economy. The jobs will hit the company's factory at Gaydon in Warwickshire and follows a fall in sales. The Unite union said it was \"devastating news\" for the workers, especially so close to Christmas. The latest monthly snapshot of the manufacturing sector from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply showed the worst activity reading since records were first kept in 1992 and a record low in employment intentions, showing firms are laying off workers in droves. The so-called purchasing managers' index \u2014 a broad measure of activity, orders and employment in the sector \u2014 plunged to 34.4 last month, much lower than expected and way below the 50 level that divides expansion from contraction. \"The scale of the downturn in the UK manufacturing PMI during November is unprecedented,\" said Rob Dobson, economist at Markit, which compiles the survey. The survey's employment indicator fell at a record pace, spelling further job cuts ahead. Unemployment has been rising all year but the pace of increase has been accelerating and experts expect it to reach two million by Christmas, up from 1.8 million now. There was also a string of bad figures on manufacturing around the world with the eurozone, US and China all showing output on the downturn. The euro zone manufacturing PMI tumbled to a record 35.6, while the Institute of Supply Management in the United States reported its PMI for manufacturing fell to 36.2, the lowest since 1982. \"The November US ISM manufacturing survey has continued today's run of awful purchasing managers' index data from around the world,\" said James Knightley, economist at ING financial markets. Compounding the gloom, the respected National Bureau of Economic Research, a group of economists based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said \"the decline in economic activity in 2008 met the standard for a recession\". There was also grim news from China as figures showed its industrial output had slumped because of the world economic downturn, putting paid to the notion that the nation would \"decouple\" from the world economy and pull ahead by itself. The United Nations said the world economy faced its biggest downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. In its Global Outlook report, the UN lowered its forecast for worldwide growth to 1% for 2009, from 2.5% this year and way below the 4%-5% enjoyed for much of this decade. It warned the world economy could contract if economic stimulus packages were not implemented by governments immediately. \"Most developed economies entered into recession during the second half of 2008, and the economic slowdown has spread to developing countries and the economies in transition,\" it said. The 13 member eurozone has fallen into recession \u2014 defined as two quarters of contraction \u2014 and Britain is almost certainly in one too, its economy having contracted by 0.5% in the third quarter of the year, a number that is likely to double in the fourth quarter according to economists. Manufacturing bodies over the weekend appealed to the Bank of England's monetary policy committee to make another big interest rate cut at its meeting this week, supplementing the 1.5 percentage point reduction it made last month. Economists said yesterday's figures, including another awful showing for mortgage lending, made a cut in the Bank's key base rate to 2% more likely. George Buckley, economist at Deutsche Bank in London, said: \"On account of the PMI we have revised our view for this week's decision. We now see a 100bps cut from the MPC on Thursday, taking bank rate down to 2%. As a result, it seems very likely that interest rates will fall below the trough of 1.5% we currently expect.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
