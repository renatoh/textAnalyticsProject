Sir Alex Ferguson's shadow XI last night incorporated the peripheral, the peeved and, in the case of Cristiano Ronaldo, the perplexed. Unable to bridge the gap between the Carling Cup and Europe's premier club competition they will qualify as runners-up from Group D and now face a 60% likelihood of Italian opposition in the next round. The second-half hat-trick from Tuncay Sanli and Lyon's victory against Sparta Prague means United will be drawn against one of five of the other group winners - three from Serie A in Juventus, Internazionale and Milan, plus Bayer Leverkusen and Monaco. It is a daunting list. Yet had they won Group D United might have found Bayern Munich, Barcelona or Real Madrid waiting for them, so Ferguson was entitled to argue that his experiment had not gone totally wrong. Nevertheless he had good reason to be dismayed by the manner in which his team were overwhelmed. \"I have no complaints about the score,\" said Ferguson. \"The disappointing part was our defending because any experience we had was at the back. But I don't regret playing this team. Whether we finished first or second, we were always going to have someone tough to face in the next round.\" Istanbul has previously seen United's team coach bombarded with rocks and \"Welcome to Hell\" banners brandished at Ataturk airport. Yet the only hostility this time came from the Turkish press with a barrage of hostile headlines berating Ferguson's decision to leave behind so many high-profile players. They had expected Ryan Giggs and Wayne Rooney but they got Kieran Richardson and Liam Miller. Ferguson's explanation that he wanted to conserve his first team for more important missions cut little ice here but by the end of the first half United had actually succeeded in subduing the Turkish crowd. Darren Fletcher, for one, showed why he has legitimate grievances not to be playing more regularly and Phil Neville, the stand-in captain, was defending as though affronted about having fallen down the pecking order like a stone in a well. Yet the decibel levels picked up within 90 seconds of the restart. Tuncay's brilliant bicycle kick was the first goal United have ever conceded on Turkish soil and, buoyed by the breakthrough, the home side took command. Tuncay headed in his second after Richardson conceded a senseless free-kick on the edge of the penalty area and a stylish hat-trick was completed in stoppage-time when more generous defending allowed him space to run unchallenged at Tim Howard's goal. United were staring glumly at only their sixth defeat in their last 40 Champions League games and only a goal-line clearance from the substitute Gerard Pique prevented a fourth goal. Whether there are serious repercussions will be determined by the draw next Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
