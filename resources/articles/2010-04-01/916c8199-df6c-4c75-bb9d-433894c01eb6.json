No, don't throw the paper down, this is not like anything you've seen before. You can call it a temple or a mosque if you prefer. The roof is as wide as the sky, and rivers run down the aisles. There are no leaders, no laws and there will be no collection plate. This is not an illusion but a body of believers, much like the one the atheist Philip Pullman wishes for in his bold new telling of the Easter story, The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ. The good-hearted Jesus, about to be betrayed by his sly twin Christ, kneels and prays to a God he knows is not there. \"Lord, if I thought you were listening, I'd pray for this above all: that any church set up in your name should remain poor and powerless and modest.\" It should have no property, and \"wield no authority except that of love\". We can all agree with that this weekend. The Roman Catholic hierarchy remains engulfed in the scandal of abusive priests. The Church of England \u2013 which has often been the very opposite of \"poor, powerless and modest\" \u2013 is struggling to cope with the loss of its status, wealth and most of its people. Neither organisation can muster a million followers on a Sunday, and attendance has fallen for the fifth year in a row. The pews may fill a little more this weekend, but on the whole people don't want to belong to anything, let alone a needy, demanding church. That is not to say they have stopped believing. Not at all. Pullman's prayer is unwittingly in tune with a huge change in our culture: the rise of a new national faith. I call it the Church of Everywhere, because it's everywhere and nowhere baby, that's where it's at. The Church of Everywhere consists of all those people who believe in a god of some kind but don't belong to a religious organisation. Polls routinely show two thirds of us in the UK have faith in a higher power. Take away the three or four million in church each week and four million members of other faiths, and you are left with about 30 million people who believe but don't belong. They don't have a collective voice because they are each doing their own thing. But they are certainly in the majority. I began to notice them while researching my book about the dramatic shifts in our culture. The title, Is God Still An Englishman?, comes from a George Bernard Shaw quote, in which he's complaining about the imperial delusion of a century ago. It was still there just a generation ago, when the shops all shut on Sundays, but it has gone now. There are some startling reasons for that, but the most visible is that we're becoming a mixed people, absorbing cultures and religious practices from around the world. As a friend with Anglo-Irish-Asian-Caribbean grandparents puts it: \"We are all from everywhere now.\" Some complain, others celebrate the possibilities. You can see it at Stonehenge for solstice, or at festivals, as people seek the divine in the open air. Even new forms of morris dancing, most eccentric of \"traditional\" pursuits, have become a way for people to express their spirituality outdoors. They are part of the new faith, which doesn't mind what your god is called. Improvised, individualistic and hard to pin down, it does still have some identifiable collective values, including fair play, individual freedom and the notion of the Earth as a sacred place. We are still haunted by Christianity, as Archbishop Rowan Williams has put it, but the God who lives in our collective imagination now is influenced by paganism, Buddhism and the green movement. Heaven no longer stars Saint Peter, but involves being absorbed into nature. \"The brightest star in heaven\" is a phrase familiar from a thousand roadside memorials, and we heard it a year ago this Sunday at the funeral of the Big Brother star Jade Goody. Her service put the new faith of the people on display, live on television with white doves, party balloons and lots of tears. It was hosted by the Church of England in Essex, but was really Church of Everywhere. The crowds watching on screens outside gasped at the home videos and blinked back tears at slushy songs. I was there, and this was powerful stuff that worked for people \u2013 until the time for formal religion such as the liturgy, when people started making phone calls, or just walked away. That's how things stand this Easter. We have walked away from our old, established God, but started making up our own, anarchic Church of Everywhere \u2013 because despite organised religion letting us down, like Philip Pullman's humanist Jesus, we simply cannot resist the urge to pray."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
