Glamorgan were the potential beneficiaries of the bad weather. With Essex\u2019s match against Kent at Chelmsford one of the casualties of the prolonged downpour, victory over Gloucestershire in that five-overs game would see them steal a spot in the quarter-finals. They resoundingly failed to take advantage, scoring 45 runs in their five overs after being put in to bat as Gloucestershire\u2019s bowlers excelled \u2013 James Fuller bowled a maiden and Benny Howell conceded one run from his over. Graham Wagg batted out 11 dot balls on his way to scoring six runs off 15 deliveries (though one went for four leg byes) before, having twice been struck on the helmet by bouncers, he retired hurt with four balls of the innings remaining. \u201cOur skill level tonight was very good with the ball,\u201d said Michael Klinger, the winning captain. \u201cOnce we saw that the wicket was pretty green and seaming around a bit we got our lengths right and used the wicket really well. I thought with the bat instead of trying to overhit balls like they did at times we played some really good cricket shots.\u201d With Wagg unable to bowl because of his injury Chris Dent led the reply with an unbeaten 28 off 11 balls and Gloucestershire, who knew they could not advance, reached a match-winning 51 for the loss of two wickets, with seven balls to spare. \u201cIt was really disappointing,\u201d said Jacques Rudolph, who said that Wagg \u201cseems to be OK\u201d despite his blows to the head. \u201cGloucestershire outplayed us tonight and unfortunately we\u2019re out but I thought we had a fairly decent competition overall. Having said that, we\u2019ve got a few lessons we can learn.\u201d There was not a single ball bowled at Chelmsford and Essex\u2019s head coach, Paul Grayson, admitted afterwards that, although he would have preferred to go through differently, he was just glad to be in the last eight. \u201cWe would have preferred to have played and beaten Kent to book our quarter-final place but I am still happy we have made it through,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cAfter our poor start in the competition, when we lost four of our opening five matches, to have reached the quarter-finals is something that we have to be happy with, no matter how it was achieved.\u201d All the other matches on Friday were rained off in similar circumstances, apart from at Headingley, where Yorkshire signed off a dismal T20 Blast campaign with an eight-wicket win over Birmingham Bears. Winning the toss, the Bears struggled to 145 all out, Laurie Evans top-scoring with 25. Yorkshire\u2019s acting captain, Alex Lees, set his side on the path to victory by striking a measured 63 from 47 balls with eight fours and featuring in a second-wicket stand of 104 with Jack Leaning. Once Lees had gone, trapped lbw by Jeetan Patel, Leaning continued on the way to his maiden T20 half-century and he was unbeaten on 60 when Yorkshire crossed the line with three balls remaining.
