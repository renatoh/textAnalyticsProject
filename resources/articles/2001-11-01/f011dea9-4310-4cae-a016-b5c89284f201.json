It goes without saying that they dearly would have loved to defeat Second Division Tranmere Rovers, but no matter what happens during the rest of this season's FA Cup campaign there will be few more heart-warming moments than those that occurred after the final whistle at Prenton Park on Saturday. What's black and white and red all over? Not these Zebras. They were never embarrassed. Beginning with an extra- preliminary-round match back in August, this was Brigg's 10th match in the competition. Here they were, from the far-flung reaches of the Northern Counties East League, the very essence of Cup romance. The only pity was that James Leech's gloriously struck goal was ingloriously missed by the BBC. Shame on them. Ultimately Brigg were, as was to be expected, well beaten. Yet they never stopped playing a brand of precise, intelligent football that recalled Derby County and Nottingham Forest sides under Brian Clough. This may sound fanciful, but it was a joy to see players from this level of football always looking to pass to feet, to create space and use their brains. They finished almost on their knees, such was the effort they had expended, but their spirit was never quenched. Indeed, had Simon Roach managed to equalise Alan Navarro's first-half free-kick, Brigg might - just might - have give last year's quarter-finalists a much closer run. Raz Clayton, their long- serving 59-year-old manager, was understandably just a little apprehensive that his side might lose heavily, and Leech's goal, with the score at 3-0, was greeted by the Brigg bench as if it had been the winner. At that point Tranmere, who entertain Carlisle or Barnet in the next round, were threatening to double the score. It put the brake on, and eventually enabled Lincolnshire's Zebras to look back on their first FA Cup first-round match with pride and satisfaction. Not that they are unused to the big occasion, having won the FA Vase at Wembley five years ago against Clitheroe. \"Where would you rather walk out - Prenton Park or Wembley?\" said Clayton. He had a point, although there was no disguising what this Cup run had meant to a man whose own professional playing career with Scunthorpe United was cut short at the age of 22 by a knee injury. \"We've played so many matches I think they should give us the trophy and make another for the winners. My lads deserve it.\" So they did. Man of the match : Jason Price (Tranmere Rovers)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
