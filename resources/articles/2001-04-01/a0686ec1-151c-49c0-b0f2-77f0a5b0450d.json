Having earlier predicted their visit might spark a 5-5 goal glut, the Liverpool manager G\u00e9rard Houllier has clearly been mixing mind games with defensive drills. Instead, faced by a five-man midfield in front of an inspirational rearguard, Barcelona huffed, puffed and foundered in angry frustration. \"I'm not going to apologise for becoming only the third team to come here and stop Barcelona from scoring,\" said Houllier. \"If I'd gone out and attacked and lost by three goals you would be calling me naive. What's the point in being naive? That would be a betrayal to our supporters. \"You have to look at the size of the pitch and the quality of the opposition and you see how English teams have fared here. We were looking for an away goal but we have done very well defensively. You have to praise the team. You don't achieve performances like this at the Nou Camp by luck and we were not allowed to attack more.\" Only when home irritation translated into sloppiness late on - the substitute Robbie Fowler's looping header from Steven Gerrard's cross had Jose Manuel Reina scurrying nervously - did the visitors threaten to prise a priceless goal. Yet at the final whistle it was mission accomplished and the strains of You'll Never Walk Alone drifted across the emptying arena. While Liverpool have been gorging themselves on three fronts recently, with the FA Cup and their pursuit of a top- three finish still whetting appetites, Barcelona - a city of sumptuous seafood - have been left with the scraps of a season of damp squids. Their humiliating elimination from the first phase of the Champions League prompted Louis van Gaal's ignominious departure. An inability to challenge Real Madrid at the top of La Liga has grated ever since. From the dregs of Van Gaal's reign Lorenzo Serra Ferrer has at least whipped up this Uefa Cup pursuit. Nevertheless, with the mouth-watering array of attacking talent at his disposal, under-achievement hangs heavy in the air even if apathy has yet to creep on to the terraces. Last night's game, potentially the biggest of Barca's season, was played to a deafening din of drums and firecrackers from the stands. For the victors a final in Dortmund awaited, probably against Alaves who were busy building up a 5-1 first-leg lead against Kaiserslautern. Not that the patient short-passing routines of the early stages had pulses racing until Rivaldo emerged to skim a shot off Sami Hyypia for a corner before evading his marker to nod Luis Enrique into the area; but the Catalan sliced his shot horribly wide. With Emile Heskey playing as a withdrawn left-sided midfielder, only Michael Owen's tireless running provided an outlet to disrupt Barca's monopoly on possession. Yet, with white shirts banked behind the ball, the procession of home attacks was repelled to hoots of derision. Pep Guardiola's 24th-minute free-kick was nodded behind by Markus Babbel with Patrick Kluivert poised at the far post and Jamie Carragher dived to block Luis Enrique's second-half goal-bound shot after Sergi's cross had been inadvertently touched on by Hyypia. Much to the chagrin of the home side, Rivaldo, still twisting and turning to create his own space, then flicked a volley wide of Sander Westerveld's near post. When the Brazilian's lay-off with four minutes to go was smashed goalwards by Xavi only for Westerveld to save smartly, the Catalans appeared as likely to find a finishing touch as Gaudi might on his Sagrada Familia. After 17 years without a European trophy some of the old Scouse swagger is showing its head again and Liverpool's defensive defiance warmed their supporters' cockles. \"We can score three if we need to at home,\" added Houllier. \"Perhaps the balance of the game was wrong and we should have had more of a sense of adventure and audacity, but we've scored 96 goals this season, the most in England, and they haven't included 95 own-goals. It will be different at Anfield.\" Liverpool (4-5-1): Westerveld; Babbel, Hyypia, Henchoz, Carragher; Murphy (Smicer, 60min), Gerrard, Hamann, Berger (McAllister, 83), Heskey; Owen (Fowler, 73). Barcelona (4-2-3-1): Reina; Gabri, Puyol, De Boer, Sergi; Guardiola, Cocu; Luis Enrique (Xavi, 72), Rivaldo, Overmars (Zenden, 72); Kluivert. Referee : H Krug (Germany). \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
