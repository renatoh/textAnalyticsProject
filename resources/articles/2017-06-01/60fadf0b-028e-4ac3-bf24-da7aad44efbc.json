Cruse Bereavement Care points out that it sets no conditions on when people can approach it for help, however a death has occurred. It is working as part of the team with the Red Cross and other organisations and agencies to provide support at Grenfell Tower. Last week we twice referred to Gavin Barwell\u2019s predecessor as housing minister as James Wharton. We meant Brandon Lewis (\u201cRevealed: the tower block fire warnings ministers ignored\u201d, News, page 1; \u201c\u2018Why does it take a tragedy for government to prioritise saving lives above money?\u2019\u201d, News, page 4). Our general election graphic headlined \u201cHow Britain Voted\u201d inadvertently included the seven seats won by Sinn Fein twice, both in the \u201cOther\u201d category, and in a category of their own. The \u201cOthers\u201d should have totalled five (four Plaid Cymru and one independent) and not 12 (In Focus, 11 June, page 29) .
