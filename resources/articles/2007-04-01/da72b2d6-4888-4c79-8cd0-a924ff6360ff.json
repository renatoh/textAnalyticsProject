Who paid for your wedding, and how did it affect who made all the decisions? NA, on the talkboard It's a bad idea to yoke complex financial transactions and family politics. We paid for our own, and it was better to have the small one we could afford than have all sorts of other \"interested parties\". The result was a happy and relaxed event. My partner tells of a huge wedding where the bride's parents were divorced. The mother and father competed to throw money at it, and the couple went along with it. Every possible bit of flummery was added. The whole thing ended up like a ghastly Mike Leigh play. ER, on the talkboard I've given my daughter \u00a34,000 towards her wedding, and paid for her clothes. Her fiance's parents and grandparents have given them about the same I think. They are paying for the rest themselves. I have given my opinion on various details when asked, withheld it when not asked, and made admiring noises when presented with a fait accompli. KY, on the talkboard My wife and I paid for everything. My mother tends to want to dictate what happens so it was with great pleasure that we could tell her to butt out when she got too much. Also, some people said they wouldn't go if such-and-such was there. It's pretty easy to tell them where to go when you are paying for the whole shebang. DE, on the talkboard Hello! magazine - on condition they had the exclusive. NP, on the talkboard We paid for half the cost of ours, then both sets of parents paid for a quarter each. We made all the decisions and I did most of the planning and admin, but they were on hand to help if necessary without interfering. Pretty ideal. VA, on the talkboard We paid for ours. Mind you, we went to Gretna Green. The whole thing cost about \u00a3500, and the lack of hassle and the feeling that it was just \"ours\" was wonderful. GG, on the talkboard My friends threw a major strop and cancelled their wedding when certain parental parties got too controlling. They then married at a later date but their way. Quite frankly, whose wedding is it anyway? JN, on the talkboard We paid for it all. Our mothers are bad enough on a free ticket. God knows what they'd have been like if we'd let them buy shares in the event. YG, on the talkboard It shocks me that parents/in-laws think they have the right to coordinate your wedding (flowers, seating, guest list), when it's your wedding! Just because they're paying for it, what gives them the right to choose who they want invited? FM, on the talkboard Mr H and I paid for the majority of ours, we had a contribution from each parent which basically meant we could leave some money in our savings. Decisions were wholly ours: no favours, not overly fussy flowers or peripherals and it was the best day of my life. HH, on the talkboard It's also worth reminding yourself that you have accepted the offer of them paying for things; you didn't ask for them to pay. It's a small difference, but an important one. NI, on the talkboard We are paying for most of it ourselves. I'm very glad as it means we don't have to consult anyone else. We both see the wedding as the one big meaningful event we get to do in our lives. I'd hate to look back on it and think \"I wish I'd done it this way.\" SF, on the talkboard If people don't want their parents to have a say in the wedding, can't they just not take their money? VL, on the talkboard It's not that people don't want their parents to have any say in the wedding - it's just that you don't want them to take over completely and for it to become their day. On my first attempt at organising my wedding, I ended up cancelling the wedding in the early stages as it was getting out of control. Previously sane parents were going crazy with a must invite list (up to 140 people at one point with none of our friends included). They weren't even paying for any of it! Second time round they realised that I would just bugger off somewhere and get married without them, so they were helpful, not controlling. LL, on the talkboard My parents are paying for my wedding, and really it's a process of negotiation. I don't really care very much about most aspects of it - I have the final veto over everything. KN, on the talkboard When parents suggest paying (\"we can afford it and you guys are just starting out, it's traditional for the father of the bride to pay, etc\") and you accept, you have no idea they are going to turn into controlling wedding-obsessed types. I've read a lot about the psychology of weddings, and parents often cover their sense of grief, loss and lack of control about \"losing a daughter\" by fixating on a hectic wedding planning checklist of things they can control to obsess about instead. NY, on the talkboard We were all set to pay for everything, but both sets of parents wanted to help out financially, and I think would have been quite hurt if we'd snubbed their generosity. TF, on the talkboard My parents were anxious to pay for my wedding. I'm the only girl and they were preparing (secretly) since they met my fiance. My mum, in particular, really wants me to have the kind of wedding she didn't have. KN, on the talkboard I'm an adult and have long since stopped expecting them to buy me things, so accepting huge wodges of cash for something as optional as a wedding would feel wrong. But all families are different. HN, on the talkboard Being given money made me spend it more carefully. If I had just frittered it away I would have felt ungrateful. As it was we spent on what seemed worthwhile to help everyone to have a good day, for us to get rings we would be happy with, and to have an enjoyable honeymoon. We saved the rest for a flat deposit. IN, on the talkboard I haven't been given a cheque as such, but as things come up we talk about it and when the decision is made, my parents have been paying. As a consequence, the whole wedding is very pared down. Probably I'd have gone for more if Mam and Dad didn't want to pay for the whole thing, but they've insisted on it for anything I've picked, so I've chosen the most minimal things available. KN, on the talkboard Anne Robinson paid for my wedding when my then partner (now husband) won just under \u00a310,000 on The Weakest Link. Cait Hughes, by email We fully intended to pay for ours, but it turned into a race between us and my dad whenever it came time to pay for something. Our original plans got rather embiggened because of him, but only in the sense of being able to have more/nicer food and booze, the DJ for longer, etc. Afterwards, we tried to give him money towards it. Dad eventually accepted this, but has cunningly placed the cash in a long-term investment account for future mortgage or grandchild purposes. LC, on the talkboard Our wedding cost us about \u00a3500. One Wednesday lunchtime, we asked people to come for lunch and then took them all to the register office, then to a local hotel with a buffet. My mum still hasn't got over me not involving her. VN, on the talkboard My dad bought me a CD player a few years ago. Doesn't mean he gets to come round and play his Willie Nelson CDs on it. Same goes for your wedding. Doesn't matter who is paying for it; it's your day. AN, on the talkboard Any answers? On the radio there was a debate between a woman who always opened her husband's mail and a woman who didn't. I didn't believe I gave up my right to any privacy when I got married and don't even open my kids' mail. What do others think?
