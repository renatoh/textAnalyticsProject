In response to the one-notch downgrade to A- by S&amp;P, the insurer's chief financial officer Richard Houghton said the decision would not have a \"material impact\" on the its operations, customers or ability to trade. \"We remain confident that RSA will re-emerge as a stronger group in 2014,\" Houghton said. Fitch said it would decide on RSA's rating after the group's annual results on 27 February and more revelations of accounting problems could prompt it to downgrade. A large cut in the insurer's rating could lead brokers to stop recommending RSA products. On Friday, RSA said it was looking to raise more capital after it was forced to move \u00a3135m of capital into its Irish arm. The company has also added \u00a3200m to its Irish claims reserves to meet potential whiplash claims, depleting its potential 2013 annual profits. The announcement caused the departure of chief executive Simon Lee, leaving the group in the hands of chairman Martin Scicluna. \"Some of RSA's key financial metrics are weaker than its ratings would suggest,\" Fitch said in a note. Selling trophy assets in overseas markets, where RSA makes two thirds of its revenue, could be its least worst option. Investors who have seen their shares fall 28% since the start of this year look unlikely to back a rights issue and analysts say the company is worth less than the sum of its constituent businesses, making the prospect of a full takeover remote. \"The key thing is that if there is a capital shortfall, shareholders will be unwilling to plug it with a rights issue,\" said one institutional RSA shareholder on Monday. RSA shares have fallen by close to 12% since Thursday, the day before its latest profit warning. Scicluna, who has been running the insurer since chief executive Simon Lee quit on Friday, told Reuters any part of the business could be sold, but declined to say which were the most likely. If RSA were forced to divest trophy assets such as businesses in Scandinavia, Canada or emerging markets in Asia or Latin America, this would amount to 'selling the family silver,\" according to Shore Capital Stockbrokers. RSA would be left with a rump of slow-growth western European assets such as its Irish business, where consultant PwC is due to report on suspected accounting problems in January, and Britain, where market conditions for insurance are tough. Broker Canaccord Genuity estimated RSA would have an equity value on disposal of up to 130 pence per share, assuming the individual businesses are valued at between eight times forward earnings for the British arm, and 15 times for the Canadian unit. That compares with Canaccord's target price for the whole group of 85 pence, implying it is worth more broken up than as a whole. RSA shares were trading at around 90 pence on Monday. No bidder has yet come forward, an RSA source said on Monday. The source said the firm is being advised by its corporate brokers JP Morgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Scicluna and his team are scheduled for a routine meeting this week with ratings agency analysts, the source said. RSA has an implied rating of 'BBB', according to Thomson Reuters data, compared with an average of 'BB+' for its peer group of UK insurers that includes 'A' rated Aviva."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
