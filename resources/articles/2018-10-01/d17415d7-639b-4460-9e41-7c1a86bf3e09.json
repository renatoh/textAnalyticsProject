In adverts micro-targeted to individual constituencies, voters are exhorted to \u201ctell your local MP to bin Chequers\u201d. The link takes them to a localised page with a picture of their constituency and their MP\u2019s name. A further click opens up their mail client, with a pre-written email addressed to their MP, and the campaign itself blind-copied in. The campaign, which is estimated to have reached more than 10 million voters, was discovered by the digital campaign group 89up, which shared the details with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee into fake news. \u201cThis advertising is designed to specifically influence MPs,\u201d 89up said in its written evidence. \u201cTo put this in context, Ukip has declared just \u00a3114,000 since 2018 started.\u201d All that is known about the campaign is what can be found on its website, Twitter and Facebook accounts. Going by the name Mainstream Network, the group writes and publishes news stories on its website with an almost exclusively pro-Brexit slant, shared on its social media accounts. Its website was registered in November 2017, with the first material being published in February 2018. \u201cMainstream Network has potentially a bigger budget than Ukip, and is aiming to influence MPs, yet there is no transparency whatsoever over who is paying for this website,\u201d said 89up. \u201cFacebook claims to be tackling fake news but individuals or groups with a political agenda can still remain entirely anonymous on the platform and reach millions of people.\u201d 89up suggests the practice of copying in Mainstream Network to the campaign emails may result in a GDPR breach. \u201cThe only assumption that can be made about this,\u201d it said, \u201cis that this user\u2019s data (the user\u2019s email) is being stored and used for marketing purposes, eg to target users with bespoke ads on Facebook using the \u2018custom audiences\u2019 feature\u201d. \u201cGiven that there are no specific data opt-ins on Mainstreamnetwork.co.uk, it is highly likely that this process and the subsequent likely storing of user emails is a breach of GDPR.\u201d Other than the GDPR compliance, there is no suggestion that anything Mainstream Network or its backers have done is illegal. Except for registered political parties, political communications in the UK are largely unregulated outside election periods. There is no requirement to disclose funding sources or to reveal who paid for or promoted an advertisement. MPs who have been on the receiving end of Mainstream Network\u2019s campaigning say this must change, and that the details of its approach are uniquely 21st century in character. \u201cOver the last couple of weeks, I received a flood of about 50 emails \u2013 some quite abusive \u2013 urging me to \u2018chuck Chequers\u2019 and vote for out-and-out Brexit,\u201d said the Labour MP Paul Farrelly, a member of the DCMS committee. \u201cAnd that\u2019s only the ones I\u2019ve seen, not any that didn\u2019t get through the spam filters \u2026 Usually, it is possible to tell who\u2019s behind email or letter-writing campaigns, but not in this case.\u201d On Tuesday, Facebook announced a new set of rules for political advertising in the UK. Based on similar policies in the US and Brazil, the site now requires political advertisers to prove they have a UK address, and British or European ID, before they can run political adverts. It also requires them to publicly declare who paid for the adverts before they will run, and the site stores a copy of every advert, along with information about spend and audience, in a new ad library. But the rules, which become mandatory on 7 November, would not have significantly affected the Mainstream Network campaign. Advertisers are free to write what they want in the declaration, which means the campaign could simply declare that the adverts were \u201cpaid for by Mainstream Network\u201d and provide no further information. And while the site requires the person buying adverts to have a UK address, it sets no requirements on the ultimate source of funds. Farrelly added: \u201cApart from the anonymity, bile and bias of this website, what is really of concern here is that the campaign with these ads has come at a time when Facebook has introduced a policy for greater political transparency, yet nothing has changed.\u201d Damian Collins, the chair of the DCMS committee, said: \u201cHere we have an example of a clearly sophisticated organisation spending lots of money on a political campaign, and we have absolutely no idea who is behind it. The only people who know who is paying for these adverts is Facebook. \u201cWhile debate on one of the central issues facing our country is part of a thriving democracy, there is an important question of where campaigning stops and political advertising starts,\u201d Collins added. \u201cFacebook has recently announced a set of changes to increase transparency around political advertising on its platform. This example offers Facebook an opportunity to show it is committed to making that change happen \u2013 if you are targeted with a message or asked to lobby your MP, you should know exactly who is behind the organisation asking you to do it.\u201d Mainstream Network has not replied to requests for comment. Rob Leathern, director of product management at Facebook, said: \u201cOn 7 November, all advertisers will have new requirements before they can place political ads in the UK, including Mainstream Network. \u201cThese advertisers will need to confirm their identity and location through an authorisations process and accurately represent the organization or person paying for the ad in a disclaimer. These steps must happen or the advertiser will be prevented from running ads related to politics on Facebook.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
