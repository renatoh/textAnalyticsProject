There are also signs that more cabinet members are now backing electoral reform for the Commons, possibly by adopting a version of the alternative vote (AV) system, but a statement by the prime minister today will only promise to look for cross-party consensus on the issue. Instead, Brown will use today's announcement to outline a new bill to clean up parliament that will include a legally enforceable code of conduct for MPs, an end to parliamentary self-regulation, and greater powers for backbenchers to scrutinise laws. It is possible that MPs found to be in breach of financial aspects of the code could be subject to recall by their constituents, a means of triggering a fresh election. The bill will also set up a new Parliamentary Standards Authority, which will be able to disallow expenses claims, order some to be repaid and issue financial penalties. It would also regulate and administer peers' allowances. But it would not discipline MPs, which would remain an issue for the Commons standards committee. It will propose giving backbench MPs greater control over the Commons agenda and clarify the extent to which select committees are independent of the power of the whips. In the statement, the prime minister is likely to hint at a fresh push on Lords reform, which has previously been blocked by Tory peers. The move will put huge pressure on David Cameron to either disown his peers or bring them into line. Voting reform has also been debated at cabinet with Jack Straw, Peter Hain, John Denham and Lord Mandelson among those known to favour the AV system. This model allows voters to list their preferences, rather than simply voting for one candidate as now. Alan Johnson, the new home secretary, is backing a more proportional form of AV. The prime minister's spokesman said yesterday that Brown was open-minded about electoral systems for the Commons, but there is a strong view among some cabinet members that a referendum on electoral reform before the election would be likely to be lost. Others remain deeply sceptical that a new electoral system is a relevant response to voters' anger with MPs over the abuse of expenses. A Ministry of Justice source said there was no chance of staging a referendum on the issue before the general election. The push to try to regain the initiative on political reform comes as the prime minister's new national democratic renewal council \u2013 in essence a cabinet committee \u2013 met for the first time yesterday. It discussed a wide agenda of electoral reform, Lords reform, parliamentary reform and distribution of power to localities and regions. In addition to the proposals to reform parliament, Brown's decision to make the Commons statement himself today underlines his determination to make political renewal one of three centrepieces of his recovery, along with public service reform and the economy. Brown survived a challenge to his leadership on Monday night after promising to address his weaknesses. The foreign secretary, David Miliband, yesterday declared that Labour had \"settled\" its leadership question, adding that Johnson, the \"leading contender\" to replace the prime minister, was backing him \"to the hilt\". Miliband disclosed that when he heard about James Purnell's resignation from the cabinet on Thursday night, he immediately assured Lord Mandelson, the business secretary, that he would not also resign. However, he skirted round the question of whether he had \"flirted\" with the idea of resignation, saying only: \"Flirtation is dangerous for married men. I'm not going to get into that.\" He added that it was the responsibility of all Labour party members to consider the impact of managing to secure just 15% of the vote in the European elections. Purnell said yesterday that he did not regret his resignation or his statement that Brown needed to stand down to give Labour a fighting chance of winning the next election, adding that he hoped the prime minister would prove him wrong."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
