According to a source Jingye was \u201cextremely interested\u201d in making a bid after senior executives \u2013 including its chairman, Li Ganpo \u2013 flew into the north of England last week for meetings with MPs, unions and advisers to the sale. British Steel collapsed into liquidation in May, threatening 5,000 staff directly \u2013 700 of whom work at Teesside\u2019s Lackenby and Skinningrove sites and the rest at Scunthorpe \u2013 and at least 20,000 more in the supply chain. Anna Turley, the Labour and Co-operative party MP for Redcar, who welcomed Li to British Steel\u2019s Teesside plant, said of the meeting: \u201cWe discussed the future and huge potential of British Steel, especially our proud steel community and workforce. It remains my priority that the final buyer for British Steel must understand the UK industry and be invested in its future.\u201d Ben Houchen, the Conservative mayor of the Tees Valley, added: \u201cJingye \u2013 a Chinese steelmaker \u2013 are in advanced discussions to buy British Steel. They were one of the other bidders during the process a matter of weeks ago, but are now the frontrunners to buy the business. It was wonderful to listen to chairman Li about his plans for British Steel and what we can do together to project jobs on Teesside.\u201d However, any deal is bound to trigger concerns about the implications of Chinese ownership of a major British business. Ataer, owned by the Turkish military pension fund, is still in the frame, despite it not reaching an agreement during a recent 10-week period of exclusivity granted by the official receiver, which named the preferred bidder. Liberty House, run by the Indian steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta, is also understood to be rekindling its interest in the business, although its bid is likely to result in jobs losses as it reportedly plans to turn its Scunthorpe plant into a steel recycling centre. An unspecified but substantial financial indemnity provided by the government has enabled the company \u2013 via the official receiver \u2013 to continue to trade, even while insolvent. As rescue talks continue, the threat to local jobs is likely to become a major campaigning issue in the forthcoming general election. If a buyer cannot be found and the steelworks shuts down the UK would in the future be forced to rely on overseas producers for certain types of steel used in construction and on railways. The official receiver declined to comment. The Guardian contacted Jingye but did not hear back by the time of publication."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
