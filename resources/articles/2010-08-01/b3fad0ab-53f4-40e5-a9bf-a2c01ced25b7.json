But it is also a mark of the extent to which the once mighty engine of unionism has itself stalled. Until recently the UUP and its predecessors were in every sense the party of the Northern Ireland establishment. But the men and women \u2013 only around 2,000 of them these days \u2013 who will choose Sir Reg's successor next month are no longer the party of Carson, Craigavon or even Trimble. From 46% of the vote in the February 1974 election, the UUP sank to a new low of 15% in May this year. Even though they had hoped for a boost from the restored alliance with David Cameron's Conservatives, the UUP scraped barely 100,000 votes across Northern Ireland on 6 May, and now, for the first time in the modern era, sends not a single MP to the House of Commons. It is the most significant party political eclipse at Westminster since the collapse of the old Liberal party in the interwar years of the 20th century. It is no longer enough, though, as it might have been in the past, to say that the UUP's decline is neatly reflected in the ascendancy of its nemesis. Peter Robinson's (and formerly Ian Paisley's) DUP had a bad election in May too. Though the DUP easily outscored the UUP three months ago, Mr Robinson lost his own Westminster seat, while his party's overall share of the poll dropped by 9%. With the total UUP/DUP vote declining from 369,000 in the 2005 election to 271,000 in 2010, the total number of votes for the two main unionist parties was narrowly exceeded for the first time by the combined vote for the nationalist SDLP and the republican Sinn F\u00e9in. This not just a richly symbolic moment in Ulster politics. It may also point to Sinn F\u00e9in emerging as the largest single party in next spring's assembly elections. That would allow Martin McGuinness to lay claim to Mr Robinson's post as first minister and might trigger fresh instability at Stormont. Many unionists, Mr Robinson included, have responded by urging the UUP and DUP to bury their differences and create a single unionist party. Others from both wings, including Dr Paisley (now Lord Bannside), insist that differences remain real and that younger voters, less sectarian than their elders, would be repelled by a party based so exclusively on identity. Either way, this is a period pregnant with significance for Northern Ireland's political future. It would be good to think that Sir Reg's departure will trigger a battle of ideas as well as a contest of individuals. But don't hold your breath."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
