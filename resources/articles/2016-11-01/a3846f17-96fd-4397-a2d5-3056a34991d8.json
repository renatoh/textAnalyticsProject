The interim head coach, who stepped into the breach following Sam Allardyce\u2019s abrupt departure in September, will complete his four-game spell in charge in Tuesday\u2019s friendly with Spain at Wembley. Southgate, who has sanctioned Harry Kane\u2019s return to Tottenham Hotspur, is the overwhelming favourite to become the country\u2019s 15th permanent manager and is only expected to make a few tweaks to the side who beat Scotland on Friday. England will not play again until a friendly in Germany next March but, while the FA intend to follow proper process in making an appointment, there is a desire for clarity and stability up and down the coaching staff with a number of teams having effectively been disrupted by Allardyce\u2019s exit. The senior side are in the middle of their World Cup qualification campaign while Southgate\u2019s under-21s, being overseen by the under-20s coach, Aidy Boothroyd, have qualified for next summer\u2019s age-group European Championship in Poland. \u201cIt would be important for me to know what I\u2019m doing after the middle of November,\u201d said Southgate when asked if it was important to resolve the situation quickly so as to start planning. \u201cI think for everybody because we\u2019ve got the European Under-21 Championship to prepare for, and the seniors have got the next round of games to prepare for. \u201cEverybody is going to want to know by the end of November, middle of December, where everything\u2019s heading so that we can decide who is responsible for which parts of the organisation\u2019s work. Whichever body of work that is remains to be seen. \u201cI\u2019m loving this opportunity. I\u2019m immensely proud I\u2019ve been given the chance to lead the country for three games, and there\u2019s another one on Tuesday. And to be involved in an England-Scotland game, which was as high pressure as you can be, was a brilliant experience, preparing the whole week and emotion of winning the game. That was very, very special. But [the chance to finish what he has started] is not my decision in the end.\u201d Southgate added: \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed what we\u2019ve done so far. We\u2019ve got some more detail which we want to add in for Tuesday and the players are starting to see how we build the amount of information and the need to work on slightly different things for each game. That\u2019s the challenge for every coach but it\u2019s for others to decide what will be the continuation for every team.\u201d Nathaniel Clyne and Ryan Bertrand may start against Spain having sat out the 3-0 victory over Scotland, while Jamie Vardy could replace Daniel Sturridge up front now Kane has returned to Spurs. Jack Wilshere is also pushing to make his first appearance for England this season and, with Gary Cahill suspended for the next World Cup qualifier, against Lithuania in the spring, the friendly may also be an opportunity to hand Michael Keane a debut. His club-mate at Burnley, Tom Heaton, may gain a second cap at some point. \u201cWe will make changes for the game, but we want to get the balance right,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to give some players an opportunity, and we\u2019ve got competition for places, but we also want to keep the structure in place and momentum from what we did in previous matches. So, while I don\u2019t want to change too much, there will opportunities for other players to come in. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve tried to do over the course of the three games is not to think short term in terms of how we want to play. It would have been easy to look at Scotland and say: \u2018Scotland is a pivotal game in what we are trying to do, so we won\u2019t take any risks playing from the back. We won\u2019t encourage the team to play, (but will) play percentage football and, with better players, we win the game\u2019. Well, we didn\u2019t want to do that. We wanted to play in a style which we believed was right in the long term, a style that would encourage our younger players. There is more risk in that. It\u2019s not going to happen in two or three games but every game we play we get a bit more into the players in terms of style and I think there\u2019s more evidence of that, looking at Friday night. This team has a lot of improving to do.\u201d He added: \u201cOutside Wayne Rooney, Gary Cahill and Joe Hart, we don\u2019t have players with loads of caps or huge big match experience with their clubs. They have to understand there\u2019s lots to improve upon. But there\u2019s good potential and I like the attitude and mentality of the players. They want to work and embrace new ideas but it won\u2019t be a straightforward path. That\u2019s why games like Tuesday are important.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
