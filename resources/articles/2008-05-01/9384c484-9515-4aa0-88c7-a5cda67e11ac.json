A huge rare raptor, with its 5ft wing span and talons strong enough to lift a lamb, soared 46 metres (150ft) over the heather fells and then fell precipitously, twisting, turning and somersaulting as it plummeted to within a few feet of the deep heather. Again and again Murphy watched its - at first spurned, later successful - attempts to woo a female harrier on the other side of a small valley. But the second greatest sight for the man who monitors and researches the most controversial and rarest bird in England is its nest. Creeping through the boggy undergrowth to within a few feet of a nest whose location is a closely guarded secret, Murphy, one of four people licensed to approach the site, and the Guardian, this week deliberately \"put up\" the young mum. It leapt from its bed with an angry squawk and soared up, \"chittering\" wildly. It is a well-disguised and slightly raised nest almost covered in heather, and the five blue eggs in it were larger than any chicken's. All will hatch in the next few weeks, greatly increasing the chance of the hen harrier's survival in England. From the middle of next week, anyone will be able to view the nest via \"nest-cam\"- a CCTV camera. But the fledgling birds' life may be short. Hen harriers should be found everywhere in England's uplands but there are only 15 known pairs. For many landowners and shooters, that is 15 too many. The birds are renowned hunting machines that eat a fifth of their body weight a day in mice, rat, voles and, especially, young grouse. When it costs \u00a3100,000 or more a year to keep 1,619 hectares (4,000 acres) of moor fit to shoot, a raptor that kills anything small that moves is not just unwelcome but customarily eradicated by gamekeepers. The hen harrier is now the centre of an acrimonious tussle between conservationists and gamekeepers, a situation stoked last year when two hen harriers were shot over the Queen's estate at Sandringham, Norfolk, while Prince Harry, his friend William van Cutsem and a gamekeeper were out duck shooting. All three were questioned by police but released without charge after they denied any knowledge of the incident. According to the RSPB, the bird is the most persecuted in Britain, with large grouse moor estates being primarily responsible for keeping numbers tiny. Bowland moor is the bird's only stronghold in England and the one place that Murphy and Natural England, the government's statutory nature adviser, hope the bird will consolidate and then spread out from. Last year three harrier nests were found on the moor. This year there are five nests with 38 eggs between them. One reason why the birds may be thriving on Bowland but nowhere else in mainland England may be because the land is mostly owned by the Queen and the Duke of Westminster. Neither they nor United Utilities, the water company which owns another great stretch of the moor, want to be embarrassed by accusations of persecuting the protected bird, said Martyn Howat, the chair of English Nature's hen harrier recovery project, which wants to see the bird in every upland county. The understanding, he said, is that Bowland's gamekeepers are under strict instructions not to persecute the birds, whereas the directives on most of the 200 other large grouse shooting moors in upland England may be less clear. English Nature tries to bring the naturally distrustful moor managers and conservationists together. \"On the one hand it's easy to blame the hen harrier for the decline in harriers but it's equally easy to blame the gamekeepers, when it may be something else, like hunger, that is keeping their numbers down,\" Murphy said. \"There's a myriad of factors: 70% of all the young will die - eagle owls will kill them up here. We always look for anthropocentric causes but that's not always right. Its tough out there for the birds.\" Murphy tracks them all by radio and in six years has not found one shot or missing on Bowland. \"I put it down to a combination of the gamekeepers being frightened of the stigma that would be attached to a persecution incident and growing common sense,\" he said. \"It's not a case of right and wrong. We know that persecution exists of the hen harrier, but there is no evidence of it here.\" The paradox, according to Howat, is that the harrier and many other raptors should benefit from good grouse keeping. \"A keeper will kill hundreds of predatory stoats, weasels, foxes, rats, and squirrels a year,\" he said. \"This enables ground-nesting birds like the harrier to breed more successfully.\" Murphy said: \"It was like a scouse wedding, bringing the conservationists and keepers together at the start, a real us and them situation. I have seen bad behaviour on both sides, but the thing is, they are all really passionate. They both love their birds, just different ones. There's got to be a balance.\" High points \u00b7 The hen harrier was once common in Britain, but by 1900 it only survived on remote Scottish islands \u00b7 It made a comeback after the second world war when there were fewer gamekeepers \u00b7 Since the 1990s numbers have fallen dramatically \u00b7 There are 15 breeding pairs in England, 623 females in Scotland and 43 females in Wales \u00b7 They eat small birds and mammals \u00b7 The chicks spend 30-40 days in the nest while they learn to hunt \u00b7 Birds born in England have been tracked to Denmark Source: Natural England From next week ornithologist Stephen Murphy will be providing regular updates on the chicks' progress with highlights of the best footage from the webcam theguardian.com/environment"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
