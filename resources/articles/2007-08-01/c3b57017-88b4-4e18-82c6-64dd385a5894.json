The ritual complaint - that the exams have got easier - has an added twist this year. The curriculum, which now includes subjects such as media studies, is allegedly getting softer. Both charges will be strengthened if, as expected, 25 per cent of papers are awarded the top A grade. Both charges are specious. There is no evidence that exams have been 'dumbed down'. The pass rate will, as usual, represent a genuine improvement. Pupils are better taught and more adept at passing exams in a wider range of subjects. Far greater numbers are fulfilling their potential. If that is not cause for celebration, it is difficult to know what is. Another dubious complaint often made is that when so many students do well, top universities cannot distinguish the very best candidates. That is really a grumble about the dramatic rise in the number of school-leavers going to university in recent years. It is elitist nostalgia for the days when only a select minority sat A-levels and went on to higher education, while the rest made do with worse life chances. For some, that is still the case. Last year, almost 5 per cent of state school children got no GCSE passes and nearly a quarter got no more than D grades. A fifth of 19- to 24-year-olds are not in education, work or training. The cost to society, the economy and the individual is catastrophic. Instead of belittling the achievement of those who pass exams, we should be focusing on the needs of those who fail them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
