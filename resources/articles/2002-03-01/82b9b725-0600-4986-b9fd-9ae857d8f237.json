If her recent work has seemed to hint at despair, her latest, Fox , shows a renewed sense of purpose. Rich's poetry proposes and represents an ethic - the \"lighthouse keeper's ethics\" as she puts it in one poem - vigilant, protecting, inclusive: \"you tend for all or none.\" There is a sense of courage and resilient dignity, despite a realistic awareness of the pressures within and against, which Rich has always possessed. What Rich does not do is lapse into her own, private despair, nor allow self-indulgent doubt as to the value of poetry. Instead she restores precisely the sense of generous community she feels has been nearly destroyed by the political situation she inhabits and rejects. In deceptively simple words, precisely used, she has created a beautiful and inspiring volume. The Zoo Father Pascal Petit (Seren, \u00a36.95) Pascal Petit's collection of poems is a narrative of sorts. The narrator's father, who raped and abused his wife and children and abandoned them all when the narrator was eight, is dying. The mixture of rage, obligation, hurt and new power is mediated through a progression of animal and insect metaphors: humming-birds in straitjackets, a mask of fire ants, a nest of wasps, a glove of hunter ants. At one point she decides to become \"a tiny candiru\" and to \"swim up your stream of urine / into your urethra, Father, / and wedge my backward-pointing barbs / deep inside your penis\". It is hard to criticise material so apparently personal. None the less, poets who take suffering as subject matter do so knowing the risks. The subject matter has its own power; does the poetry transform it sufficiently from any other account of appalling abuse? Not entirely, not sufficiently. The same poetic procedure is applied in nearly every poem, the same drama of childhood impotence converted into adult omnipotence through acts of the imagination. There could have been one, perhaps two powerful poems to be extracted from this approach. At book length, The Zoo Father asks that we participate in the gruelling experience of someone else's therapy. Spanish Fly Neil Rollinson (Cape, \u00a38) Neil Rollinson's second collection of poetry consists almost entirely of descriptive and anecdotal pieces about personal and domestic topics. He has sex, or a curry; he is in the supermarket, or on the tube; he buys a burger, or gives a poetry reading. To these topics he brings predictable adjectives and stock metaphors. \"Pudding\", a cento of Mills and Boon clich\u00e9s, misfires slightly, since its style is not so very different from Rollinson's own. Here, for example, is Rollinson on curry: \"I scour the menu for the most incendiary dish: / chicken jalfrezi, prawn vindaloo / or mutton phall, blind to the bhunas / and kormas, the sag aloos and brinjal bahjis [ sic ].\" The line breaks, one notes, could go anywhere. Yes, there is as much poetry in the menu of your local tandoori as there is in Spanish Fly . Possibly more."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
