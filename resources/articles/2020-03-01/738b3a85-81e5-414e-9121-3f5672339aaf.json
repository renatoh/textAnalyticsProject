The economic impact is already dire. Millions are probably already out of work, and economists are certain we are heading for recession. Donald Trump has a solution: get back to work. But it is a solution that many think will make matters worse, leading to the loss of even more lives and a deeper economic crisis. Trump stood by his suggestion on Tuesday, saying he wanted the US open for business by Easter, just 19 days away. \u201cI think it\u2019s possible. Why isn\u2019t it? We\u2019ve never controlled the country before and we\u2019ve had some flus and some viruses. I think it\u2019s absolutely possible,\u201d Trump told Fox News. \u201cWe have to get our country back to work. Our country wants to go back to work.\u201d The administration is now reportedly considering easing some physical distancing directives in order to halt the collapse of the economy. Many experts think that\u2019s a terrible idea. The result would be \u201can open door to chaos\u201d, said Professor Michael Greenberger, a former counselor to the United States attorney general and now director of the Center for Health and Homeland Security at the University of Maryland. \u201cIf it is just a question of whether we go down the public health track or we follow free enterprise, unmitigated by public health concerns, it would be folly to make things worse,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that calculus has to take into account that people are going to get sick and die.\u201d Greenberger said he could understand the desire to support the economy but that such short-term thinking could be devastating. \u201cThere are no two ways about this. The shutdown of the economy is damaging. It is a balancing of risks. I think we will be in worse shape in the public health sector and the financial sector if we just unthinkingly send people back to business as usual.\u201d Even one of Trump\u2019s closest supporters, the Republican senator Lindsey Graham, has distanced himself from the president\u2019s position in a tweet, writing: \u201cTry running an economy with major hospitals overflowing, doctors and nurses forced to stop treating some because they can\u2019t help all, and every moment of gut-wrenching medical chaos being played out in our living rooms, on TV, on social media, and shown all around the world. \u201cThere is no functioning economy unless we control the virus.\u201d But Trump has pinned his re-election hopes on soaring stock markets and record lows in unemployment. Now with stock markets in freefall and jobs set to follow, he seems determined to press ahead and try to relax restrictions on business in an attempt to cure the economic crisis. Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said such a move would probably fail, economically and politically. \u201cThe first question is: what will people do?\u201d she said. Gould said some people were likely not to return to work even if ordered to do so. Secondly, she said, it was clear that state governors \u2013 who have shut down so many cities \u2013 would resist any move from Trump that could worsen the escalating health crisis. Even in normal times, such a conflict would create a constitutional crisis. In the current situation it could be much worse. Greenberger said: \u201cIn your worst imaginations, and our worst imaginations have come alive in this episode, you could see serious tension between the active military deployed to enforce the opening of businesses and the state police who are enforcing the closures.\u201d Trump predicted Americans would see \u201cpacked churches\u201d this Easter. Public health experts, including the senior official Dr Anthony Fauci, have said Americans will need to adhere to physical distancing restrictions for at least several more weeks to stop the spread of the virus. Such chaos would only exacerbate the problems in the wider economy. Stock markets have fallen even as the Federal Reserve pumps billions into the economy, interest rates are cut and the government works on a bailout plan that could end up costing close to $2tn. Until there is better news on the virus, all bets are off for the economy. The experience of China and South Korea show there is \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d, said Greenberger. \u201cThere is an end to this, a way to go back to business as usual \u2013 after having let the infection run its course.\u201d Nevertheless, the short-term temptation for Trump to try and push for a return to a normal may prove insurmountable. Not least because as the economic crisis deepens it is clear that his administration made fundamental errors that have exacerbated the situation. Covid-19 can\u2019t be blamed on Trump, but moves he made before the crisis and after it began have substantially worsened the situation \u2013 and with it the economy. In the wake of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the Obama administration set up a directorate for global health security and biodefense to prepare for future pandemics like Covid-19. The Trump administration eliminated it \u2013 although there is a fierce political fight over whether or not the roles were reassigned. No matter how you view it, Greenberger argues, the fact is that the US was woefully unprepared for a pandemic that security agencies had reportedly recently warned it about. Trump has disputed those claims, but there is no disputing that shortly after Covid-19 hit the US it became clear the country was ill equipped to deal with it. Frontline health workers are begging for supplies. \u201cIf we had had the testing, the masks, the PPE [personal protection equipment] in stockpile, we would have been able to cut this thing off eight weeks ago,\u201d Greenberger said. \u201cIf we had been better prepared for coronavirus, the economy wouldn\u2019t be where it is right now,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
