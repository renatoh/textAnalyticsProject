He was lying where he fell, gradually hidden then finally lost as shellfire exploded in the earth around him in a field near Lens, northern France. When the cold soil, compacted over a century, finally surrendered him on a sunny January day in 2018, he was another unknown soldier. It would take painstaking detective work before the name L/Cpl Frederick Thomas Perkins, 25, could be carved with confidence on a headstone. At his reburial with full military honours this week at Loos British military cemetery near Lens, ahead of Remembrance Sunday, his tearful granddaughter, now 67 and a grandmother herself, could still scarcely believe it. \u201cBecause he was lost. No one knew where he was. And now he has a grave and a headstone. And so many of them won\u2019t,\u201d she said. About 50 first world war soldiers are found on the western front each year, disinterred by the farmer\u2019s plough or developer\u2019s digger. Only one or two in ten are ever identified, said Steve Arnold, an exhumation officer with the CWGC (Commonwealth War Graves Commission) recovery and reburial unit based near Arras. Arnold was called out to recover Perkins\u2019 remains, found during a check for unexploded ordnance on the site of a planned new hospital in Lens. Among belongings found, his helmet, bayonet, knife and fork were badly corroded and revealed little. The first real clue was a pair of metal shoulder titles of the Essex Regiment. And then there was the spoon. It was engraved with \u201c4EX\u201d on one side and the number 3899 on the other. There was no identity disc. \u201cBut we were lucky that Essex Regiment decided to have numbers put on their spoons,\u201d said Arnold. It looked as though this unknown soldier was serving with the 4th battalion of the Essex Regiment. There was only one problem: that battalion never served in France. \u201cSo how did he end up there? Was this even his spoon?\u201d said Arnold. Today, 160 sets of recovered remains lie behind the closed mortuary doors at the CWGC Experience centre at Beaurains, near Arras, where the public can see the work of the stonemasons, blacksmiths, carpenters, and gardeners who for 100 year have maintained the immaculate Commonwealth cemeteries of the western front and across the world. It is home to the recovery and reburial unit. Each set of remains is a puzzle that Arnold, his team and the British armed forces \u201cwar detectives\u201d at the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre are working to crack. Arnold\u2019s report on Perkins included that a fragment of a notebook found with him bore the number 389 \u2013 indicating that the spoon was indeed his. But there was another problem: no soldier had the number 3899 recorded on death. The report landed on the desk of Rosie Barron at the JCCC. Service numbers were not introduced until 1920, and first world war regimental numbers changed if you switched battalion. \u201cAt some point he had served with the 4th battalion, the Essex Regiment, and with the regimental number 3899\u201d said Barron. \u201cBut we probably weren\u2019t looking for someone still serving with the 4th when he died.\u201d One obstacle when researching first world war records is that more than half were destroyed in the second world war, when German bombers struck the War Office repository in London. However, each battalion kept a war diary. Handwritten, they detailed action and casualties and are kept at the National Archives. Barron ploughed through each of the eight Essex Regiment battalions with soldiers still missing, looking for which had ever passed through Lens. \u201cIt was a big task,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I found that the 11th battalion was in the area in 1917. They attacked from there on 22 April and they were also in the area between 24 June and 9 July 1917. That threw up 67 soldiers still missing from the 11th battalion,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t had the spoon and the notebook, that is probably where the search would have ended.\u201d Maj Peter Williamson, the chairman of trustees at the Essex Regiment Museum in Chelmsford, took up the challenge. \u201cAll the army numbers they had at the point they died were recorded. But not one of them started with 38,\u201d he said. Evaluating sequential enlisting numbers he worked out the unknown soldier probably enlisted in the 4th battalion, a territorial unit, in around April 1916. He would not have had time to be trained and deployed to another battalion before joining the 11th. Eliminating those who had served with other battalions, Williamson whittled possibles down to just 28. \u201cThen I had a \u201clightbulb\u201d moment\u201d, said Williamson. Next-of-kin of first world war dead were paid a war gratuity, the amount dependant on rank and length of service. Details are recorded in a series of books held by the National Army Museum, but digitised on some genealogy websites. Working back from possible dates of death, he could calculate if someone might have enlisted in April 1916. That led him to a probate section devoted entirely to soldiers\u2019 wills. \u201cIn the first world war, lots of soldiers made straightforward wills on an army form,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I then ordered as many wills of those 28 as had made a will. The will for L/Cpl Frederick Thomas Perkins eventually came in. And bingo.\u201d It had Perkins original number, 3899, and the new number he was allocated when he went over to France and was sent to the 11th battalion. He had died on 22 April 1917, alongside 51 other men of his battalion, who have no known grave. A match was later confirmed by a DNA test with a great nephew. L/Cpl Perkins, from Great Waltham, Essex, was aged just 25 when he died. He was married to Florence Annie and was father to a young son, Philip Jethro. He was the eldest of seven children of James and Elizabeth Perkins of Ford End, Essex, he worked for TD Ridley and Sons Ltd Hartford End Brewery Essex. And he died during a raid on Nash Alley, north of Lens. His granddaughter, who lives in Chelmsford and has two sisters living in the US, has been researching her family history for more than 20 years. Cook had posted his photograph on Ancestry.com years ago, so was dumbfounded when she received a message from Barron that he had been found. \u201cI always knew my dad\u2019s dad had been killed in the first world war, and my father was only three when it happened. And his mum \u2013 my nan \u2013 remarried when he was about five. So I don\u2019t actually remember anything much being said about him,\u201d said Cook, who has her grandfather\u2019s war medals. The Royal Anglian Regiment, into which the Essex was amalgamated, provided bearers and a firing party for his funeral on Thursday. \u201cThe service was beautiful. I know he is now at peace, among his comrades. It\u2019s something I will take to the grave with me,\u201d Cook said. She intends to give the possessions found with him to the Essex Regiment Museum. \u201cBut the spoon, I don\u2019t know if can. It\u2019s going to be really hard. Because that is one possession that means so much.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 9 November 2019.
