He warned that firms were \u201ceating themselves\u201d by favouring shareholder dividend payouts over investing their profits. That tendency, Haldane said, was to blame for \u201csubpar\u201d growth in some economies, including Britain\u2019s, in recent decades. He also reiterated his opposition to raising interest rates in the near future, maintaining the distance that has opened up between him and the Bank\u2019s governor Mark Carney on the issue. In an interview with the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme on Friday, Haldane said that there was \u201cno rush\u201d to push up rates because economy was \u201cstill healing\u201d. \u201cThere are still people without a job who would like a job; there are still people with jobs who would like to work more hours. And, even for those that have got jobs, their pay \u2013 in most cases \u2013 isn\u2019t racing away,\u201d he said. And he said there were economic risks across the world that could still hit Britain. \u201cFor me, the combination of a still-healing economy, very low price pressures and a wobbly world means that there is no rush to move rates from where they are right now.\u201d Haldane said that, besides pushing lower than expected growth, company laws in the US, UK and other countries that place the shareholder \u201cfront and centre\u201d were partly to blame for triggering the financial crisis. \u201cIn many cases, it was the result of banks seeking high return to remit to shareholders. How did they do that? By borrowing too much and therein the seeds of the crisis were sown.\u201d He said that the law puts the \u201cshort-term interests of shareholders in a position of primacy when it comes to running the firm\u201d. \u201cThere are other models of corporate governance round the world, which share the spoils somewhat more equally between a wider set of not just shareholders, but stakeholders in a firm. Who are those stakeholders? That includes its employees, that includes its customers and its clients,\u201d Haldane said. \u201cThe public limited company model has served the world well from a growth perspective. But you can always have too much of a good thing. \u201cThe nature of shareholding today is fundamentally different than what it was a generation ago. The average share was held by the average shareholder for around six years. Today, that average share is held by the average shareholder for less than six months.\u201d Asked whether it was the Bank\u2019s place to seek to affect statute, he said: \u201cUltimately, if we can change the structure of the system \u2013 the structure and incentives within banks and non-banks, that has got to be better for everyone.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
