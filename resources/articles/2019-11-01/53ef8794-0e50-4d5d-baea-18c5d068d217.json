In an interview with ABC\u2019s Insiders three days after the release of Labor\u2019s scathing election review, Albanese revealed the opposition was not on track for victory according to its own internal tracking polling despite the collective belief it was poised to win the May election. Albanese also accused Scott Morrison of \u201cattempting to divide the nation\u201d when asked about his claims progressives \u201csneer\u201d at their opponents and environmentalism is pitting city-dwellers against regional Australians. The review, conducted by Jay Weatherill and Craig Emerson, blamed a combination of factors for the loss including weak strategy with a cluttered policy agenda, poor adaptability in the face of the Liberal leadership change and an unpopular leader in Bill Shorten. Albanese said he had \u201craised concerns\u201d internally before the defeat including in the Whitlam oration in June 2018 \u2013 in which he argued for aspiration and against bashing big business \u2013 and in the final week after visits to key marginal seats Corangamite, Swan and Longman. \u201cYou could tell on the ground, when you listened to what people were saying, they were raising concerns,\u201d he told Insiders. \u201cAnd when you look at our tracking polling, and this I wasn\u2019t aware of, the tracking polling showed that on seven occasions, we were going backwards, and on 11, I think it was, we weren\u2019t getting a swing big enough to win. \u201cSo on a majority of the tracking polling where you go into marginal seats and look at whether you\u2019re actually going to win or not, a majority of them were telling us that we weren\u2019t going to win.\u201d Albanese also said he \u201cwasn\u2019t aware that there wasn\u2019t a campaign committee, but I wasn\u2019t a member of the leadership group making those decisions\u201d. The review found that multiple research methods were not subjected to robust debate that could have resolved inconsistencies among them. The tracking poll used during the contest \u201cwas persistently less optimistic than the published polling, but inaccuracies in the overall research program led Labor to believe it was slightly ahead when it was, in fact, behind\u201d, it said. Albanese said that he unites Labor\u2019s progressive and working class constituencies in his seat of Grayndler, where 40% of people speak a language other than English at home, home to both \u201cmany working Australians\u201d and also the \u201cprofessional classes\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t buy the false division. I think that Australians do have common interests. Australians have common interests about security at work.\u201d Albanese suggested as Morrison pretends that \u201cchange just won\u2019t happen\u201d Labor could address Australians\u2019 insecurities about what jobs they will have in the future and the impact of climate change, including on farmers and regional communities. \u201cBy having a clear platform and policy agenda, which isn\u2019t cluttered at the next election, we can bring together the forces that will see Labor as, what I believe we should be, the natural party of government for this country.\u201d Asked about Morrison\u2019s comments about \u201csneering\u201d progressives, Albanese said he did not \u201chave a problem with Labor people\u2019s tone\u201d and suggested that Australians\u2019 belief in fairness and coming together at times of tragedy, such as the current bushfires, disproved his attempts to \u201cdivide the nation\u201d. \u201cSo one of the principles that I\u2019ve put forward is aspiration. We need to ensure that we\u2019re the party of wealth creation - not just concerned about distribution. \u201cAnd when we look at aspiration, I believe the difference between me and the prime minister is he sees aspiration as just about individualism. \u201cI see it that people aspire for better things for their family, for their neighbours, for their community and for their nation.\u201d Although Albanese accepted that some people were \u201cblindsided\u201d by Labor\u2019s proposal to end taxpayer funded rebates for retirees with excess franking credits, he argued that voters were \u201cmisled\u201d, citing the example of a pensioner who didn\u2019t own shares wrongly believing she would be affected by the changes. Albanese refused to commit to dump the policy, explaining Labor would outline its policies in an \u201corderly and strategic way\u201d before the next election, scheduled for 2022. Asked about how Labor would deal with the issue of coal, Albanese argued Labor will not have to choose between the environment and jobs because \u201cclimate change is an opportunity to create literally hundreds of thousands of jobs, if we get it right\u201d. He cited his first major policy speech, in which argued that metallurgical coal is a necessary component of wind turbines. Albanese said the Coalition\u2019s bill to facilitate deregistration of unions and disqualification of their officials was an \u201cattack on the organisations that go into workplaces that deal with issues like wage theft\u201d, recommitting Labor to oppose it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
