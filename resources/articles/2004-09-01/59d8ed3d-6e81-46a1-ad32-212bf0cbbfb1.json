In that film the two warring sides keep on fighting even when they are reduced to skeletons. Lord Sterling is a veteran of the 1988 Dover dispute - when he sacked 2,000 seafarers who refused to accept his cost-cutting measures. The unions are still there but neither side is blooming. There is no Sam McCluskie - the former seafarers' leader - to cross swords with the man (one of many) who gloried in the description of \"Margaret Thatcher's favourite industrialist\". But the place of the relatively benign Scotsman is now taken by a more radical and potentially unyielding figure - Bob Crow of the RMT union. P&amp;O believes compulsory redundancies are almost inevitable but Mr Crow insists he will draw \"a line in the sand\" at anything other than voluntary change. The P&amp;O business lost \u00a325m in the first half of the year. The need for restructuring follows a catalogue of problems such as foot and mouth, Iraq, plus the end of duty-free - never mind cut-throat competition from low-cost airlines and the Channel tunnel. P&amp;O Ferries has tried a range of marketing techniques but looks like it has done too little, too late. (Norfolk Line, Brittany Ferries and other rivals, it should be noted, have seen opportunities to expand). P&amp;O denies it but one feels instinctively that Lord Sterling would like to get rid of a business whose margins will never match those of his ports division. He knows - for sure - that he will never get a good price for the company - which still carries 10 million passengers a year - unless it can be driven back to profitability. A new owner might be welcome - as the officers' union, Numast, pointed out yesterday - because he or she would inject new ideas. In the meantime, let's just cling to the hope that a restructuring can be agreed without the cordite and confrontation of a rather different (and inglorious) era. A dotcom legend The full scale of the disaster that was the former FTSE 100 constituent and dotcom star Baltimore Technologies became apparent yesterday as the board that ousted the previous management admitted that a third of the bombed-out cash shell's remaining readies could be gobbled up by litigation and leases. A rebel shareholder, Acquisitor Holdings, booted out Baltimore's board - led by Bijan Khezri - back in July after investors balked at plans to turn the former security software business into a pioneer of green energy. According to Baltimore's figures for the six months to the end of June, which were released yesterday, the failed attempt to back Bijan and his chums cost the company a staggering \u00a31m. All told the company burned \u00a38.6m over the six months - even though it has no operating units whatsoever. Acquisitor insiders privately admit to being surprised at the state of the company they inherited. It is still burning \u00a3350,000 a month because of lease obligations and the cost of maintaining its listings in London and New York. To add insult to injury, shareholders who have seen the value of their company drop from more than \u00a35bn during the dotcom boom to the square root of zero, may see those listings disappear altogether, David Buchler, the chairman, admitted yesterday. Yesterday's results showed that of the \u00a323.5m Baltimore still has in the bank, \u00a38.2m has had to be earmarked for \"provisions\" to cover \u00a36.6m worth of leases, unpaid tax and some licence fees someone forgot to pay. The company has also set aside \u00a3750,000 to cover the cost of defending itself against a claim from the AIM-listed payments group Earthport. That claim, for breach of a contract way back in April 2001, is for a staggering \u00a313.5m and Earthport believes it has a very strong case. Putting together the Earthport claim and the increased provisions outlined by Baltimore's new team yesterday, the company has a grand total of \u00a31.8m of \"free\" cash. With a following wind that's enough to get it to February. Baltimore has secured itself a place among the biggest-ever disasters of Britain's dotcom era. Revolving doors The arrival of Jonathan Haslam, a former Downing Street press supremo, to be head of public relations at the beleaguered Jarvis last year was seen in two ways. Some saw it as a sign that things were going to get better - or Mr Haslam wouldn't bet his reputation on it - while others thought it signalled a dire future and he was required to spin like a top to save a floundering firm. Last night the latter interpretation looked easily the best after the sudden exit of the chief executive, Kevin Hyde. The idea that Mr Hyde is leaving because he has put a rescue package in place and things are now tickety-boo is laughable. Indeed, it makes you worry about the PR advice supplied. Mr Hyde follows the chairman, Paris Moayedi; the finance director, Robert Sandall, and many others out the door over the last year. Will the chairman, Steve Norris, please turn out the lights ..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
