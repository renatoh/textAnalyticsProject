Nor can he say whether his new arthritis treatment is working. In fact, Cedric can\u2019t talk at all. That\u2019s because he is a horse. If this horse could talk, he might be able to save everyone a lot of trouble. Five-year-old Cedric is on the frontline of a row over the role and suitability of the homeopathic treatment of animals. The latest salvo in the war of words was fired by an Edinburgh-based locum vet, Danny Chambers, who this month submitted a petition to the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS), the regulatory body for vets, urging it to \u201cblacklist\u201d the homeopathic treatment of animals, labelling the practice ineffective, misleading and dangerous. \u201cI\u2019ve been writing letters about this to the Veterinary Times for the last three years,\u201d says Chambers, whose petition attracted more than 2,500 signatures, including more than 1,000 vets. \u201cHomeopathy is one of those alternative medicines that has a legitimacy. Most people don\u2019t understand what it is, but it\u2019s not seen like crystal healing or other alternative therapies. If you went to the doctors with diabetes and they sent you to a crystal healer, they would be doing you a disservice. I\u2019m not anti-homeopathy but it has been disproven. Conventional medicine can\u2019t fix everything, but it\u2019s not fair to give people hope for something that doesn\u2019t work and charge them for it.\u201d Around 50 of the 22,000 vets in the UK who are licensed by the RCVS practise homeopathy. Based on the principle that \u201clike cures like\u201d, homeopathy claims to treat ill health by administering diluted forms of plants and minerals. In May, Prince Charles told a conference that he treated animals on his organic farm with homeopathy as well as conventional medicine. \u201cWe have been successfully using homeopathic \u2013 yes, homeopathic \u2013 treatments for my cattle and sheep as part of a programme to reduce the use of antibiotics,\u201d he said. On a farm in Oxfordshire, Chris Day stands under Cedric\u2019s head, his hands reaching up to the horse\u2019s neck. \u201cWell out of alignment there,\u201d he pronounces. Cedric is led on a brief trot across the yard. \u201cHe\u2019s not lame, but he\u2019s going to go lame if we don\u2019t do something about it.\u201d Day, 69, qualified as a vet in 1972 and has been practising ever since, offering what he terms a holistic approach, treating the \u201cwhole animal\u201d with an array of approaches, from chiropractic to dietary advice. \u201cWe use all sorts of different tricks,\u201d he says, \u201cand homeopathy is one of them, and a very potent one.\u201d He sits on a bale of hay to consider the latest attempt to prevent the use of homeopathy on animals. \u201cThis debate has come around every year for 200 years,\u201d he says. \u201cI can understand why the people who oppose it don\u2019t study homeopathy. I can understand why they don\u2019t want to understand homeopathy. What I can\u2019t understand is this refusal to accept that there might be something there. All the animals I see are failures, they are referred to me because conventional veterinary treatment has failed. If an animal I see responds, then we have done something. How can I do this for 40 years and not be uncovered as a fraud? Word would get out.\u201d Chris Day, son of vets, came to homeopathy at an early age. \u201cIt was so off the wall that I thought: either it works or these people are completely fraudulent.\u201d He insists his early adoption of homeopathy was not to satisfy some youthful sense of rebellion. \u201cAt college in the 60s, when they were tearing down the gates, I was defending the gates. I was an establishment person. My whole practice has been put on a very professional basis because I am not a rebel. It\u2019s been much harder for me this way.\u201d The membership-based British Veterinary Association is firmly opposed to the use of homeopathy. \u201cThe BVA cannot endorse the use of homeopathic remedies, or indeed any products making therapeutic claims, which have no proven efficacy; the consequence could be serious animal health and welfare detriment because of the lack of therapeutic effect,\u201d said John Blackwell, its senior vice-president, last month. The British Association of Homeopathic Veterinary Surgeons, meanwhile, dismissed the charges in the petition to the RCVS as unfounded. \u201cIt is nonsense to suggest that homeopathy has been proven to be ineffective,\u201d it said. \u201cIt is clear that this campaign is neither rational nor professional. It attempts to remove from the veterinary domain a vital form of medicine which affords relief to patients when other therapies are ineffective, and it attempts to do so by spreading misinformation.\u201d The RCVS, while yet to produce a formal response to the petition, believes homeopathy should be used alongside conventional treatment, rather than as an alternative. In a statement, it said: \u201cHomeopathy is currently accepted by society and recognised by UK medicines legislation and does not, in itself, cause harm to animals. While this is the case it is difficult to envisage any justification for banning a small number of veterinary surgeons from practising homoeopathy.\u201d Cedric\u2019s owner, Jan Tilling, has been a client of Day\u2019s for 20 years. \u201cAnimals don\u2019t know what you\u2019re giving them, yet homeopathy works.\u201d But in an article published in New Scientist last month, Chambers argued that homeopathy had \u201cno effect beyond the placebo\u201d and animals did not experience this effect. Day smiles again. \u201cThe philosophies clash,\u201d he says. \u201cWouldn\u2019t the placebo effect be a wonderful thing if it were at work? Why should we discard that?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
