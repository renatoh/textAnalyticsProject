The argument ricocheting between London and Edinburgh about Scottish independence is wonderfully exhilarating \u2013 a new year breath of federal fresh air reflecting some of the authentic layers and complexities of British political life. For the Scottish nationalists, however, this tale of two cities is appropriately both the best of times and the worst of times. It is always tempting to cast Alex Salmond, the Scottish National party leader, as the man with all the cards in his hand. Tempting, in part, because both Salmond and the media, in London as much as in Edinburgh, have fuelled the myth of Scotland's first minister as an irresistible force leading a movement whose time has come. Yes, it may happen if the SNP's opponents allow it. But the time that has come could mark the breaking of the Salmond wave, not the consummation of his party's quest for independence. Keep in mind two things about the nationalists' current run of success that are too easily ignored. One is that the steady upward trend in electoral support for the SNP \u2013 marked by the milestone Holyrood victories in 2007 and 2011 \u2013 has not been matched by an equivalent rise in the support for independence. Scottish voters have opted for Salmond as first minister, but they prefer him fighting Scotland's corner in the United Kingdom not severing ties altogether. The second point is a variation on the first. The SNP won an overall majority at Holyrood last year: 69 seats out of 129. Yet more Scots \u2013 55% compared with 45% \u2013 voted against the SNP than voted for the party. It was a formidable win; there is no argument about that. But even facing three discredited opponents, the SNP did not win a popular majority. And the independence referendum will be all about winning such a popular majority. These points are not made to belittle the SNP's achievement, which is formidable, or to underestimate their capacity to win the referendum, which is real. But they are made in order to avoid overestimating that capacity too, and to question whether the claims about Salmond's brilliance are not sometimes a convenient legend. All polls show that Scotland is not pro-independence. The SNP's popularity in Scottish elections does not translate into support for separation. And Salmond himself is prone to mistakes, and as liable as any other politician to lose his allure. His customary bravado, an asset in the past, could begin to grate if the voters sense that he is overdoing the cocky brinkmanship in what is manifestly a serious moment. No one grasps that more than Salmond himself. It was he who, in mid-campaign last year, hurriedly improvised the proposal \u2013 which was not in the SNP's manifesto \u2013 that the independence referendum would only take place some time from 2014, not before. Salmond fears the early contest that the UK government pressed for this week. He has tried to load the referendum dice in his favour \u2013 proposing referendum votes for 16- and 17-year-olds, an ad hoc supervisory arrangement instead of the UK electoral commission, and putting a third \"devo max\" option on the ballot paper. And he backs away on popular UK issue after popular issue \u2013 the crown, the pound, the British army, the BBC and the NHS among them. Anything, in short, rather than a simple yes/no on separation. The UK government did some foolish things when it challenged Salmond this week. But Salmond's predictable sneering at David Cameron as Margaret Thatcher reborn should not distract from Cameron's achievement. The large change this week is that the UK government, and the other political parties, have broken out from the corner into which Salmond had pinned them. They have asserted their right to a say in the argument about process and, more importantly, over the substantive issue of independence versus devolution and the union. Before this week they were all on the back foot, in a corner. Now they are on the front foot, and this is turning into a contest of movement, not of position. Salmond will play the Thatcher card hard. But Scottish voters can see the differences. As long as he is humble not vice-regal, Cameron could take some tricks. But this is about Scot versus Scot, not the Scots against the English. Salmond is now facing serious, grown-up \"Made in Scotland\" opponents, not straw rivals. The appearance of Alistair Darling to counter Salmond on the Today programme on Wednesday showed that there is a weightier opposition to the SNP in the field than Salmond has been used to. Darling is about to team up with Charles Kennedy of the Liberal Democrats and the former Scottish Tory leader Annabel Goldie in an anti-separation, pro-devolution common front, pitting the three most credible party politicians in Scotland \u2013 and non-politicians too \u2013 against the fourth. Salmond will hit back, sometimes effectively. He is nothing if not tactically inventive. But these things are not set in stone. It is not so long ago that Gordon Brown was regarded as the most brilliant politician in the country \u2013 and look at him now. Salmond's position may not be as strong as it looks. He was pushed into promising a 2014 referendum this week, when in the past he has encouraged the idea that the vote might not come before 2016, after a possible outright Conservative UK general election win. Now, all of a sudden, he is also talking about talking to the other parties, and even to London, in more conciliatory terms \u2013 a brief respite from the previous incessant abuse. He began to lose his hegemony this week. That's immensely important. And it is why a deal on the referendum process beckons if both sides are canny enough to make one \u2013 perhaps with Salmond winning on a 2014 date, and somehow keeping the devo-max option in play too, while conceding to the UK over the Electoral Commission and changing the voting age in return for a confirmation of legality. It may all have to go to the supreme court, though that will be a political calculation too. Do not lose sight of the essential facts amid all the posturing. Salmond is in the market for a referendum deal, because without one he is more likely to lose. It's as simple as that \u2013 and this week has made that outcome more likely. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
