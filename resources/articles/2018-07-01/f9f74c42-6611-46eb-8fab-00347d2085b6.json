It is topped by Neymar, out on his own with 16 chances created for his Brazil teammates at the World Cup, with Kevin De Bruyne, such a force of nature in the Premier League, three back in second place. Yet breathing down the Belgian\u2019s neck, one further chance behind, is England\u2019s find of the tournament. \u201cNot bad for a Bury lad,\u201d he says, stifling a chuckle, before seeking to credit others for his impact. It must be down to the formation, or to his teammates. Trippier is too modest to take credit for his own excellence. Only four months ago, the 27-year-old was considered by most as a mere back-up. A player who had not always been a regular at Tottenham, even once Kyle Walker had departed for Manchester City last summer, was pencilled in for understudy status at best. Now, four games into a finals campaign that has rekindled the country\u2019s faith in the national team, and with Walker assimilated into the back three, he is integral to the side who will confront Sweden in their quarter-final on Saturday. The 12 chances he has generated for the collective have had people comparing that waspish delivery with his right foot, whether on the charge or from set pieces, to David Beckham in his pomp. There is another table in the Opta stat-pack that suggests no one can match his 11 corners which have found a teammate in Russia. This team may lack a conventional playmaker but not a supply line to the forwards. He puts the accuracy down to studying slow-motion footage of players such as Beckham and Andrea Pirlo, soaking up every aspect of the technique from dead balls and on the run, and is thankful for the hours spent with his former coach in the Manchester City youth team, Steve Eyre, at their Platt Lane training centre, perfecting the art of his delivery. Eyre, now Joey Barton\u2019s first-team coach at Fleetwood Town, used to marvel at the youngster\u2019s ability to strike an unsuspecting groundsman, leaving \u201ca Mitre imprint on the back of his head\u201d, with a pinpoint 50-yard pass. Trippier would be juggling the next ball by the time his victim span round to berate the assailant, with the coach playing dumb. A delegation of groundstaff eventually demanded Eyre make a formal effort to unearth the culprit. The pair still speak regularly, with words of advice issued from the Fylde coast to the Gulf of Finland. There is praise, too, for his older brother, Kelvin Lomax, whose nomadic career took him from Oldham Athletic through the lower divisions and non-league. \u201cHe\u2019s the one I looked up to back home, watching his matches every week or his training sessions at Oldham, while kicking a ball up against the wall,\u201d says the England international. \u201cHe was a professional, a full-back, and the one I wanted to follow into the game. He helped me a hell of a lot.\u201d Lomax\u2019s aspirations were wrecked by a shattered tibia and fibula, but, at 31, he is part of the family group pursuing Trippier around Russia, \u201csupporting me no matter where I am\u201d. There have been times over the years when Trippier has needed to lean on that faith. A player who found his path into the City team blocked by players such as Pablo Zabaleta and Micah Richards has taken a circuitous route to a World Cup, like many of his England teammates. \u201cAll of us have our own journeys. I was let go at City, but I always believed I could play at the top level. It has taken longer than expected and I have had to be patient and wait for my opportunity. At Tottenham it took two years for me to break into the team, but I knew the opportunity would come. \u201cNow it has, I thank the manager, Mauricio Pochettino, for letting me play Champions League football. But I had always wanted to be in this position where I play for my country in a World Cup.\u201d His parents, Eleanor and Chris, will be in Samara on Saturday while the colossal flag of St George flutters in their absence from a pole planted in the front garden of the family home in Bury. \u201cWe\u2019ll have people watching out for the house and, maybe, we\u2019ll keep the telly on for people to watch. They couldn\u2019t get out for the Colombia game but they were all in the garden watching it with the neighbours watching over the hedges and people walking past, too. That\u2019s the kind of estate we\u2019re on. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the videos of them going crazy when [Eric] Dier scored the penalty. We\u2019ve all seen the clips on social media, of people celebrating and throwing pints everywhere in the pubs when Harry Kane scored against Tunisia. It means a lot to see how happy they are. I read that 24 million watched the other night. As a fan myself, it\u2019s crazy how much it means to everyone back home. The joy \u2026 all the boys sense it.\u201d Not that Sweden, a side whom England have beaten only twice in 15 meetings, will be a pushover on the banks of the Volga. Their scout Tom Prahl has publicly noted a sluggishness in the way England move the ball, \u201cnot like teams from southern Europe\u201d, and questioned how Gareth Southgate\u2019s side will react to being pressed higher up the pitch and more aggressively. \u201cBut our aim is to move the ball quickly and manage the game well, trying to find those little pockets of space for Raheem [Sterling] or whoever is playing, by making the pitch as wide as possible,\u201d Trippier adds. \u201cThat\u2019s how we\u2019ll hurt teams. We\u2019ve got the players here to do that. We\u2019ve go the quality.\u201d As the list which had rendered him sheepish demonstrates, in the Spurs player\u2019s delivery, England pose a proper threat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
