The 36-year-old voted at Los Angeles\u2019 famous Dodger stadium on Tuesday \u2013 just one voter in what will probably be a record turnout in America\u2019s nervy, extraordinary, election. An incredible 100m votes had already been cast early in a contest that has been upended by the coronavirus pandemic and a divisiveness the like of which nobody can remember. It was clear that Cortez was among those hoping that Joe Biden would end the Trump presidency. \u201cWe have a man in the office that creates more division than anyone else and allows bigotry and racism to continue in this country. I have hope that things will change.\u201d Earlier in the day, as Monday turned into Tuesday at midnight in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Donald Trump appeared at his final rally of the 2020 campaign. Thousands of supporters trudged through muddy fields and waited in endless lines to hear the president speak, on the eve of what could be his defeat \u2013 or the start of another four years in power. Trump delivered his speech in a critical swing state where the president is hoping for a repeat of 2016, when he unexpectedly beat Hillary Clinton. In the darkness, as temperatures dipped to 40F (4C), Trump\u2019s supporters were upbeat and optimistic, but many also said they were expecting unrest in the wake of the election. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be violence either way,\u201d whether Trump or Biden wins, said Angela Young, 43. As a gun owner from a small town in Michigan, she said, she was not worried about her personal safety but added the prospect of election-related violence in the United States was \u201cstraight-up unacceptable\u201d. But on Tuesday no major problems were reported at the polls, and fears of large-scale voter intimidation or harassment had not materialized by midday. Officials have warned that counting ballots could take days due to an avalanche of mail votes that take more time to process and could result in another round of court battles. Television news channels edged into election night with caution, knowing that results could be delayed by massive early voting amid the pandemic in several critical swing states. The first results to be called by Associated Press were as surprising as paint drying: just after 7pm Biden was called as the winner of Vermont, a state that has voted solidly Democratic in presidential races since 1988, while Trump took Kentucky, which has swung Republican since 1996. Similar low-surprise results flowed in at the 7.30pm hour in Virginia, going for Biden, and West Virginia, for Trump. Election experts began to watch with close attention the results as they flowed in from Florida, a traditionally razor-close state that Trump must win, as he did in 2016, if he is to have a likely path to staying in the White house. Early results, which came stamped with bold \u201chandle with care\u201d notices on the news channels, suggested that Biden might be doing well compared with Hillary Clinton four years ago around Tampa in the middle of the state, while Trump was looking stronger in Miami-Dade county to the south where many Cuban Floridians reside. The relatively good results for Trump in Florida, were they to hold, could indicate that election night 2020 might turn into a long and nail-biting experience with no immediate resolution in sight. Masks Earlier in the day, millions across the country wore masks as they stood in socially distanced lines, filing into voting booths. Passions are high, with states including Texas, Arizona and Nevada having already surpassed their total turnout from the 2016 election just through early voting. Trump rounded off his election day with a visit to his campaign headquarters in Virginia before heading to an election night party in the White House with several hundred invitees, behind a newly installed \u201cnon-scalable\u201d perimeter fence. Biden, meanwhile, started the day at church, where he visited the graves of his first wife and his son Beau, ahead of watching the results roll in from his home in Wilmington, Delaware. One of the first important slices of intelligence in the early stages of election night was gleaned from exit polls. In early results from CNN\u2019s exit polls, weighted across both early and election day voters, top of the list of the electorate\u2019s concerns was the economy, at 34%. The coronavirus, which Biden has made the centerpiece of his claim for the highest office, came in a surprising third place (on 18%) after racial inequality (21%). Trump\u2019s attempt to rile up voters with his \u201claw-and-order\u201d pitch amid the Black Lives Matter protests appears not to have gained much traction, also coming in at 18%, though Biden\u2019s core issue of healthcare came even lower at 11%. Perhaps most surprising of all, 48% of those surveyed by CNN\u2019s exit poll said they thought Trump\u2019s efforts to contain the pandemic were going well, against 51% badly. In point of fact, coronavirus is surging through large swaths of the nation with new cases running at about 100,000 a day. National opinion polls have consistently shown a clear lead for Biden, the Democratic former vice-president who has framed the election as a \u201cbattle for the soul of the nation\u201d. Trump is in danger of becoming the first incumbent US president to lose re-election since fellow Republican George HW Bush was bested by Bill Clinton in 1992. However, the vagaries of the US electoral college and legal attempts by Republicans to curtail ballots cast in crucial swing states add uncertainty to the outcome of an election that Trump has repeatedly, and baselessly, claimed is rife with voter fraud. In battleground states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, where Biden holds the upper hand in polling, mailed-in ballots are not counted until election day, while early counting is allowed in North Carolina and Florida, other key swing states. But as election night got under way, the mood music remained calm. The leader of a group of 42,000 legal volunteers deployed for the election said that so far, there had not been \u201cmajor, systemic problems or attempts to obstruct voting\u201d. Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said: \u201cIt appears at this stage that we are on a path to a relatively successful election day.\u201d The committee operates the Election Protection hotline, which provides information and assistance to Americans who encounter problems while voting. \u201cThe problems we have seen have for the most part been isolated and sporadic,\u201d Clarke said. Anxiety remained high among voters that trouble could yet lie ahead. \u201cThere\u2019s a mass divide that just seems to keep growing and growing and nobody is going to be happy with their results if their side doesn\u2019t win,\u201d said Christopher Henson , a voter in Ravenna, Ohio. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of civil unrest and it\u2019s probably going to get worse, regardless of how the election turns out.\u201d Marcos Antonio Valero, who voted for Trump in Miami, said he was voting in person because he did not trust mail-in ballots but wasn\u2019t sure of the outcome. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret, a mystery,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one knows how it\u2019s going to end until we all know.\u201d In a sign of America\u2019s wobbling democratic structures, Trump has demurred when asked to confirm he will hand power over peacefully should he lose. This stance has led to the president being compared to a \u201ctwo-bit dictator\u201d by his predecessor, Barack Obama, as he hit the campaign trail in recent days to stump for his former vice-president. In his last-gasp sweep of the electoral map ahead of the Tuesday poll, Trump has held rallies in Iowa, North Carolina and Ohio, with attendees packed closely together despite the risk of coronavirus infections. Besieged by criticism of his handling of the pandemic and poor polling, Trump used his final rallies to claim that Biden would turn the US into a \u201cprison state locking you down, while letting the far-left rioters roam free to loot and burn\u201d. In a wide-reaching airing of grievances, Trump also took aim at Lady Gaga, the singer who has campaigned for Biden, and suggested that he would fire Dr Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s top infectious disease expert. Fauci provoked the president\u2019s ire after warning that the US faces \u201cwhole world of hurt\u201d over winter amid rampant rates of Covid infections in parts of the country. The US has already suffered more than 230,000 deaths from the pandemic, the worst toll in the world, and Fauci has warned the country may start experiencing 100,000 new cases a day as people gather together indoors in the colder months. Biden\u2019s campaign has centered on Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic, where the president has repeatedly downplayed or dismissed the severity of the virus and declined to fully endorse the wearing of masks, a key method of stemming its spread. \u201cElect me and I\u2019m going to hire Dr Fauci. And we\u2019re going to fire Donald Trump,\u201d Biden said in one of his final campaign stops in Cleveland. Biden said it was time for Trump to \u201cpack his bags\u201d, adding that \u201cwe\u2019re done with the tweets, the anger, the hate, the failure, the irresponsibility.\u201d Whether this momentous election dislodges Trump will hinge on places like Philadelphia, a heavily Democratic city in a state, Pennsylvania, that will be key in deciding the fate of the candidates. The sheer number of early votes in Philadelphia could mean a full tally may not be completed there until Friday. A line of voters wrapped around a city block at the Kimmel Center in Center City, Philadelphia, shortly after the polls opened at 7am on Tuesday. With election workers giving out hand sanitizer, the wait in the cold didn\u2019t seem to bother at least some people in line, who said they intentionally chose to cast their ballots in person to ensure it was counted. \u201cIt\u2019s a little invigorating. I know that sounds crazy to stand in a line in the freezing cold,\u201d said Lauren Killian, one voter. She added that she was concerned about how long it would take to count all of the ballots in Pennsylvania. \u201cI am worried about how long it\u2019s going to take to figure out how long the president is. Or even when something is figured out either way, is it going to be invalidated?\u201d Additional reporting Lois Beckett"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
