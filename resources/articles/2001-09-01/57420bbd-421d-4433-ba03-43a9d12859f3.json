Any such attempted exclusion on breach-of-ceasefire grounds would further destabilise the peace process. Although the Ulster Defence Association was initially blamed for the bomb, which was defused, security sources later suggested that the UVF, military wing of the PUP, was responsible. Last week, David Ervine, MLA and chief spokesman for the PUP, angrily denied any UVF involvement in the incident, demanding that the security forces justify any such claim by arrests and charges. Yesterday, however, he admitted that although the UVF leadership had told him the organisation was not involved, it now appeared 'some members were'. He insisted: 'I can't stand over every member.' Significantly, the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble has now called on the RUC Chief Constable to state whom he believes is responsible for the attack. The bomb, made up of gas cylinders, petrol containers and a primed detonator, was defused after an RUC sergeant became suspicious about the parked car among the crowds attending the fair. Subsequently, the attack was claimed by the Red Hand Defenders, a cover-name used in the past by both the UDA and the Loyalist Volunteer Force. The LVF, itself a splinter group from the UVF, has worked in co-operation with the UDA in other attacks. However the UDA now insists it had no connection 'under any guise', with either the car bomb or two pipe-bombs found in Ballycastle pubs the next day, which were duly claimed by the Loyalist Action Force. Although no one has yet been charged with the bombing, security sources continue to suggest that the car bomb was placed by a dissident element of the UVF, probably without the sanction of the overall leadership in Belfast. The decision to place the car bomb among thousands of holidaymakers attending the Lammas Fair was reportedly taken last weekend following a Parades Commission ban on a local band, the Moyarget Silver Plains. It was barred from taking part in a traditional Royal Black Preceptory march through the seaside town on Saturday after SDLP and Sinn Fein councillors intervened following disturbances in July. There is no suggestion that members of either the Black Preceptory or the Silver Plains band had any connection with the bombing. Apart from protesting about the Parades Commission ruling, it's also thought that the UVF unit behind the Ballycastle attack was attempting to demonstrate a capacity to carry out this kind of operation in the face of widespread pipe-bombings and shootings by their UDA rivals in recent months. As a result, Northern Ireland Secretary John Reid is under considerable pressure to declare that the UDA's ceasefire is over; the UVF's position is now likely to be under consideration also. However, no official action has been taken against their respective political wings, the PUP and the Ulster Democratic Party. Last July, the UDA, using its Ulster Freedom Fighters cover-name, declared that it had withdrawn its support for the Good Friday Agreement which 'the vast majority of the loyalist community have grown to despise'. But it insisted its ceasefire remained intact, despite the mounting numbers of gun and pipe-bomb attacks on people and homes in nationalist areas. Meanwhile the IRA, which is currently involved in a drive against alleged drug dealers across the North, is believed to have been responsible for last Thursday's wounding of a man in Coalisland, Co Tyrone, despite the fact that the shooting was also claimed by the Red Hand Defenders. IRA involvement is likely to reinforce the Democratic Unionists' current call for Sinn Fein exclusion from the Assembly. As Reid returns from holiday to reopen cross-party talks this week, he will be obliged to step gingerly through a paramilitary minefield on all fronts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
