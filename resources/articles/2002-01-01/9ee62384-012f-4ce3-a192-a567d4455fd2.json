The school will be closed tomorrow in an effort to avert renewed loyalist protests at the sectarian flashpoint. Today at least two police officers were injured and an armoured car was destroyed by a loyalist petrol bomb after rival crowds turned on officers as they moved in to separate the factions. The disturbances broke out at the girls' school this afternoon when Catholic parents went to collect their children. Police said four people were taken to hospital, three reported to be suffering from gunshot wounds and a fourth suffering from injuries after being struck by a vehicle. None was seriously hurt. Several windows were broken and cars attacked, according to Fr Aidan Troy, chairman of the school's board of governors. A row ensued between Catholic parents and local loyalists about who was to blame for the trouble outside the school. Then, with tensions in the area escalating, rioting broke out at around 4.30pm and police said nationalists had attacked officers with stones. Fireworks, bottles and stones were thrown at police as the trouble continued tonight. The clashes raised fears of a return to last year's ugly scenes at Holy Cross, when young Catholic girls needed police protection to walk to their school. Local loyalists in the Glenbryn area object to Catholic parents from the nearby Ardoyne part of the city using a route to the school which passes through a mostly Protestant area. There have been tensions in the area since last summer but the loyalist protests were called off late last year after a compromise was reached. Today Sinn Fein claimed loyalists were deliberately trying to renew sectarian tensions by verbally and physically abusing parents. The North Belfast assembly member, Sinn Fein's Gerry Kelly, claimed three Catholic youths had been injured by pellets after being shot at. There was no confirmation from police. His fellow North Belfast assembly member Billy Hutchinson, of the loyalist Progressive Unionist party, claimed that people in the area were blaming the Catholic parents for starting the trouble. Mr Hutchinson said: \"Apparently Holy Cross parents were coming down the road when some young guy bumped into a woman. She took exception to this and called a group of men up. \"My understanding is they wrecked five cars and proceeded to try to wreck houses.\" Mr Hutchinson said he hoped that today's trouble would not lead to a resumption of the protests. \"The potential is there. I wouldn't be surprised if people say that the protest is back on.\" Fr Troy also expressed concern that the loyalist blockade could resume. \"I'm afraid we could be back to square one again. There has been aggravation on the road since Monday. Thankfully all the children have been safely removed from the school. \"I just hope I'm wrong. I'm not sure that the school can open tomorrow. It's as bad as that.\" Sinn Fein councillor Margaret McClenaghan said it appeared loyalists were intent on renewing their controversial protest. \"Clearly the actions of these loyalists were organised to some degree,\" she said. \"I would call upon unionist and loyalist politicians to work to end this situation before it gets out of control.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
