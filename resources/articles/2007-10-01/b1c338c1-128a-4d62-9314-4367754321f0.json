The Warriors will be without the winger Mark Calderwood for Friday's final eliminator at Leeds after it was confirmed that he has broken his ankle. The coach, Brian Noble, will leave a decision on his replacement until later in the week, though the centre Darrell Goulding could move to the wing. Noble will be able to call on Shane Millard, though, after the Rugby Football League review panel decided that the hooker had no case to answer over an alleged late tackle on Hull's Mathew Head on Saturday. Iafeta Palea'asina is also expected to recover from a dead leg."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
