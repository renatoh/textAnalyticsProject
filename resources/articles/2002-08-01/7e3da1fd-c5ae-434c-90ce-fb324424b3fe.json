Anil Kumble, the players' representative, released a statement saying: \"We are caught in the middle. The ICC and Indian board can allege non-compliance with their new contracts. On the other hand, our sponsors have paid us for the right to exploit our image commercially. We want to play, but we are being prevented from playing against our wishes.\" The Indian board, rather than send a weak side to Colombo, will now press the ICC to broker a temporary truce with Tim May, the inter national players' representative. May said: \"I call upon the ICC to meet us urgently to end this stand-off.\" The ICC has taken an unyielding stance on the contracts issue, as it seeks to protect its five-year \u00a3450m contract with the sports marketing company Global Cricket Corporation. Andrew Symonds will replace Darren Lehmann in Australia's squad for the triangular one-day series in Kenya this month. Lehmann, named as part of a 14-man squad for the series against Pakistan and India, broke the little finger on his left hand while playing for Yorkshire. Matthew Inness, the 24-year-old left-arm paceman from Victoria who has replaced Mike Hussey as Northamptonshire's overseas player, is expected to make his debut in the championship match against Glamorgan, starting tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
