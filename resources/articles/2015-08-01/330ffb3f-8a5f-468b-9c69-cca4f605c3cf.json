As one has a short back and sides, the other a bird\u2019s nest of a hairstyle, it takes only a glimpse at the Evertonians past and present to confirm as much. Yet the thought at Goodison Park is that differences are attitudinal as well as aesthetic. Everton find themselves in a familiar position in the season\u2019s early weeks. Now, as in 2013, they may look like prey for powerful predators. Then, Manchester United wanted Fellaini. Now Chelsea have targeted Stones. Two bids have been repelled. Yet while the midfielder was unsettled, Everton\u2019s manager, Roberto Mart\u00ednez, is confident the defender has been unaffected. \u201cHe loves Everton. He loves the club and the team and he is an incredible professional, so I don\u2019t think you would ever expect him to sulk,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cHe will always react professionally. John is an incredible leader. He will always give everything to the club.\u201d Unlike Fellaini, then? \u201cYou said that, not me \u2026\u201d replied Mart\u00ednez, ever the diplomat. The Belgian eventually submitted a transfer request on the final day of the transfer window, prompting his \u00a327.5m move to Old Trafford. If the suspicion is that Mart\u00ednez was not sorry to see Fellaini leave for a premium price, he is determined to prevent Chelsea\u2019s diamond thieves relieving Everton of their precious Stones. Mart\u00ednez appreciates a ball-playing centre-back. He also felt the 21-year-old\u2019s mobility and ability enabled Everton to go on the offensive and secure two equalisers against Watford. Stones and Phil Jagielka were isolated as Mart\u00ednez adopted a retro, ultra-attacking 4-4-2. \u201cSometimes I left them two on two and that\u2019s my instruction,\u201d explained the Spaniard. \u201cWe wanted to get an extra man up the pitch. If I would like to highlight one key partnership in the team it would be John and Phil because you can take risks with those two. They will always find solutions and never get done.\u201d That may be a flattering assertion. Jagielka had erred in the first half, when Everton\u2019s tactics were more conservative, for Miguel Lay\u00fan\u2019s opener. Stones was left on his backside by the pirouetting Odion Ighalo as the Nigerian restored Watford\u2019s lead. No stranger to hyperbole, Mart\u00ednez nevertheless described Stones\u2019 display as \u201csensational\u201d. The Everton manager added: \u201cWhen I see him on the pitch, I feel safe.\u201d If he represents the Spaniard\u2019s bodyguard, Everton have too few bodies. Even assuming Stones stays, Mart\u00ednez wants another centre-back. Everton are the Premier League\u2019s lowest spenders this summer and their austerity economics remain a source of frustration. Tom Cleverley\u2019s forgettable debut apart, the search for something new in royal blue extended until Arouna Kon\u00e9 scored at Goodison for the first time, two years after his arrival. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the Arouna Kon\u00e9 I know he can be until today,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said. Quique Flores, the new Watford manager, saw a different side from Everton\u2019s purists. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to deal with long balls,\u201d said the architect of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s 2010 Europa League win. A cosmopolitan coach got a culture shock when Everton adopted an old-school British approach by introducing Kon\u00e9 alongside Romelu Lukaku to form a towering attacking duo as Mart\u00ednez deployed a tactic Fellaini might have enjoyed. Everton\u2019s strapping strikers formed a contrast with Watford\u2019s slight, skilful Spanish debutant Jos\u00e9 Manuel Jurado. \u201cHe is the kind of player who can provide the last pass,\u201d said Flores, who coached the No10 at Atl\u00e9tico. Jurado joined with considerable pedigree and Watford, with 12 additions, have overhauled their squad at speed. But Vicarage Road\u2019s proximity to London convinces Flores, who has also managed the third club in the Spanish capital, that the Hornets will have the footballing and geographical allure to bring in still better players next season. \u201cIn the second year [after promotion], top players wanted to go to Getafe, because it\u2019s in Madrid, and the club is growing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe feel of the place changed around, as it will at Watford.\u201d Man of the match Ross Barkley (Everton)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
