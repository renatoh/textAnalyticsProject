He turned on the local news and saw footage from a crime scene at a convenience store in Richmond, California, and a body lying on the ground covered by a yellow tarp. As he went through his missed calls, he realized that the body under the tarp was that of his 21-year-old son, Joseph \u201cBunk\u201d Alexander II. Alexander doesn\u2019t remember much from the days following his son\u2019s killing, he only recalls crying uncontrollably. \u201cHe was my namesake, my first child. We\u2019re almost at day 500 and it feels like it happened yesterday,\u201d he told the Guardian on a recent afternoon. Alexander\u2019s son was one of four young men shot and killed in Richmond, a city less than 20 miles from San Francisco, that April. And for the father, his world collapsed. \u201cI was trippin\u2019. I saw my son under a tarp on the news while I\u2019m reading the texts,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cEvery time my alarm goes off now, I think about it. The morning time is really rough.\u201d Grappling with his loss a few months after his son\u2019s death, Alexander started the \u201cJustice for Bunk\u201d Facebook group. It\u2019s one of hundreds of public Facebook pages created in memory of deceased family members and celebrities. For some, the pages operate as a place to collectively grieve and share positive memories. For others, including Alexander, they operate as informal tip lines, and spaces where people can express anger, sadness, hope and encouragement. And they provide an outlet for people to reclaim their loved one\u2019s memory and rebuke the narratives about gang activity and poor parenting that come with the violence that occurs in low-income black and Latino communities. \u201cI\u2019ve met so many moms and dads who have lost their kids all kinds of ways, and the connection is so strong \u2019cause we have the same feelings,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cThe world thinks life is supposed to go on, they don\u2019t understand it.\u201d \u201cJustice for Bunk\u201d has 582 members, and is a part of a community of parents and anti-violence activists in California\u2019s Bay Area. There\u2019s Richmond Street Angels, Adamika Village #stopkillingourkidsmovement, and Who Murdered My Child? Each of these hyperlocal pages share breaking news about murders, stories about the victim, pleas for information from family members, and updates on any cases following the murder. More than 1,700 people were murdered in California in 2017. Almost 500 (about 30%) of the victims were under the age of 24 when they were killed. Across the United States, homicide was the third leading cause of death in the US for people ages 10-24 in 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dinyal New started her Facebook page in November 2014, almost nine months after both of her sons were murdered within 19 days of each other in east Oakland. On the night of 31 December 2013, New\u2019s youngest son, 13-year-old Lee Weathersby III, was shot over 20 times as he walked home. On 19 January 2014, Lee\u2019s older brother, 19-year-old Lamar Broussard was sitting in his car when he and his friend Derryck Harris were fatally shot. In the five years since the murders, New\u2019s Who Murdered My Child Facebook page has grown to over 40,000 members and there are now Who Murdered My Child Facebook branches in cities including Chicago, New Orleans and Sacramento. \u201cI was just a mama who was very young when she lost her kids. Now that they\u2019re not here, I have to channel this energy,\u201d New said. New said a major motivation to create and maintain the page was to dispel the stereotypes that are attached to black murder victims and their parents. \u201cOh, the welfare recipient mom, she kept her kids in the hood,\u201d New says of the stereotypes that were invoked following the news of her son\u2019s killings. \u201cSince it happened 19 days apart, and it was two brothers, they automatically assumed gang activity,\u201d New continued. \u201cBut it\u2019s not always what the news media puts out; that one son got killed because of the actions of the other. You have to dig deeper.\u201d Camille Hannays-King, a counselor and researcher who specializes in anxiety and depression among black families, said that in reports on young black men being lost to gun violence, the assumption of innocence is often lost. \u201cThe assumption is that they were involved with something illegal and as a result people may withhold support or may be judgmental,\u201d she said. \u201cParents who feel stigmatized often times retreat,\u201d Hannays-King added. \u201cBut social activism is powerful. It builds communal connections, and it retrieves the child from being just \u2018murdered\u2019 to someone the [parent is] protecting.\u201d While these pages exist primarily online, the social support and sense of purpose that these pages offer can help build the type of community that experts like Hannays-King say is a valuable part of bereavement and healing. \u201c[The page] keeps my mind off of what happened,\u201d Alexander echoes. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good or a bad thing. That\u2019s why in the morning and at night it\u2019s so heavy on me because most of the time: I\u2019m fighting for justice making posts.\u201d Both Alexander and New say that their version of justice includes the arrest and conviction of the person or people responsible for their sons\u2019 murders. And while neither have experienced this justice, they are active members of a network of parents who, because of their shared trauma, have become community activists. \u201cI hope [the Facebook page] may touch the heart of someone who\u2019s about to go pull the trigger,\u201d Alexander said, \u201cand lets them see that they\u2019re gonna hurt someone\u2019s whole family just by pulling the trigger over some bs.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
