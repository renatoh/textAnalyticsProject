The giant loose-head prop may have become a well loved oom (uncle) to South Africans of all races over his 13-year career, but he was also a link to a time that South African rugby wishes to forget. The 35-year-old - and his 33-year-old team-mate Percy Montgomery, who is also stepping down - were the last remaining Springboks to have played in all-white national teams. The last such team took an inauspicious curtain on 26 June 1999, when the Springboks helped Wales open the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff by obligingly losing to them for the first time, 29-19. In the 109 Tests since then the Springboks have always fielded at least one non-white player. The question now is whether another watershed has been crossed. Was last night the last time that as few as two non-white players will appear in a Springbok team? South African rugby officials have volunteered too many hostages to fortune over the years to fall into the trap of specifying what is an acceptable number of non-white players. But in the opinion of many - including South African Rugby Union president Regan Hoskins - the numbers at this World Cup squad were simply not good enough. 'Quite frankly we've made very little progress since the last World Cup,' said Hoskins, after naming a World Cup squad containing six non-white players - five coloured and one black, in South African terminology. 'The planning for the next World Cup starts now,' said Hoskins in the build-up to last night's final. 'The lack of progress is not the national coach's fault, I think it's the administrators who are at fault and we have to take responsibility for that. I look forward to 2011, if we do our homework - and I believe we will.' Progress in transforming rugby has been painfully slow. In the biggest matches at the 1995, 1999 and 2003 World Cups the Springboks fielded XVs featuring one black wing. After each tournament the promise was made that 'next time' it would be different. It never was, and the two black wings this year were not so much a 100 per cent improvement as a condemnation of the administration's efforts. The men in the middle of all this are the coaches, the men who have to deliver black players in Springbok teams. The departing Jake White has tried, leaving almost no stone unturned. In his four years, White capped 35 new Springboks, 16 of them non-white. To put that into perspective, in this season's Super 14 the five South African teams fielded 28 non-white players and of those only 10 have not been capped in White's Springbok teams. This eagerness to transform has had its victims. Chiliboy Ralepelle, an outstanding age-group hooker and captain of the South Africa under-21s, was fast-tracked into the Springboks and even captained a Springbok XV against a World XV in Leicester last November - at the age of 20. Ralepelle, a black African, had already been tipped as a future captain and he remains the poster boy for rugby's transformation. Ralepelle should have been the third hooker in the World Cup squad, but a succession of injury problems in Super 14 knocked him out for the season. The suspicion is that, for political reasons, he was being asked to play too much hard rugby before he was properly ready. To non-South Africans the idea of quotas - albeit unspoken ones - in any sport may be anathema and most South Africans of all colours rail against. But only the most recalcitrant white rugby fans would argue against the imperative behind them - the need to transform. Rugby's fiercest critic is Butana Komphela, an MP for the governing African National Congress party and chairman of the parliamentary sports watchdog. 'Sport cannot be exonerated from the broad picture of government programmes,' he told rugby chiefs earlier this year when they appeared for one of their quarterly floggings. 'Sport cannot be excluded from imperatives of empowerment and transformation.' Employment law regulates workplace representation, and an amendment to the sports and recreation act was passed into law earlier this year, giving the sports minister unspecified powers to intervene in 'recidivist' sports. Komphela even threatened to have the Springboks players' passports withdrawn. This pressure to transform even created the curiosity of a white 'quota' player. Stormers captain Luke Watson is the 23-year-old son of anti-apartheid hero Dan 'Cheeky' Watson who, with his brothers, turned his back on white rugby to play in the townships at the height of the struggle. It was not only brave, it was also illegal at that time. Luke Watson was an outstanding South Africa under-21 flanker and skipper and was also hailed as a 'future Springbok captain'. But he became a cause celebre during an impressive 2006 Super 14 season when White refused to select him. White's argument has always been that Watson was neither good enough nor big enough to cut it. But whereas other players overlooked by White simply had to accept their fate, Watson was given a back-door entry. The family have powerful friends who were determined to right what many perceived as a wrong and the pressure from politicians to include Watson became so intense the player was added to the Springbok training squad, against the wishes of a furious White. Watson made his debut in a Test against Samoa in Johannesburg, after which White was allowed to continue his preparations without him. While all this was going on there was an unsourced newspaper story claiming that the Springboks team in 2008 would have its first black coach, contain 10 black players and be captained by Watson. Union president Hoskins has vehemently denied that any such plan exists, but the fact that White was not offered an automatic renewal of his contract tells its own story: South African rugby is moving on to a new page. That is certain to include a requirement that whoever succeeds White should finally deliver the promised acceleration in transformation - even though he will not immediately have any more black players from which to choose. What that means for the vast majority of the World Cup squad - three-quarters of whom will be young enough to compete in 2011 - is for the future. The politically-connected Springbok manager Zola Yeye, an outstanding wing in his day in the segregated black national team and a friend of the Watsons, is noncommittal. 'I don't want to talk about \"big changes\" because it becomes so ominous, as if the sky is going fall,' says Yeye. 'The sky is not going to fall. When you transform sometimes it becomes painful and sometimes it becomes joyous - that's the nature of the beast. 'This team is not customised for any particular race group in South African society. We are a diverse society, so what is important for us is to meet those unmet needs so that sport mirrors our society. It would be an indictment on us if nothing happens.' So as Os 'The Ox' Du Randt goes into retirement, South African rugby is preparing to welcome another man-mountain: Tendai 'Beast' Mtawarira, a powerful and dynamic prop. Mtawarira is already a cult figure among fans of the Sharks in Durban - black and white."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
