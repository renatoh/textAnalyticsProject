Mr Howells' attack on the former Take That star followed reports that Williams had told journalists at a music trade fair in Cannes: \"I think [music piracy is] great, really I do. There is nothing anyone can do about it. \"I am sure that my record label would hate me for saying it, and my manager and my accountants.\" Speaking during an online debate on Guardian Unlimited, Mr Howells, who has courted controversy with comments about rap musicians and their alleged role in glamorising gun culture, said: \"I'm appalled at Robbie Williams' statement. \"He has an \u00a380m contract [with EMI] and probably doesn't worry too much about all those singers, songwriters, musicians, and music publishers who depend entirely for a living on receiving honest revenue from sales of their product. \"Williams should not be defending theft, and this is real theft.\" Mr Howells said that music piracy amounted to \"going into a record store and shoplifting the material on sale\", adding: \"I hope that musicians everywhere will condemn [Williams'] statement. \"He should also realise that many of these pirate operations are linked to organised crime on a worldwide basis. In saying that piracy is a 'great idea', Williams is doing the work for international gangs involved in drugs and prostitution who find music piracy an excellent way of laundering their profits. \"The industry should ask him to think again, not least his publishers EMI, who are one of the leading companies in lobbying government to take stronger action against music pirates.\" Earlier this month, following the deaths of two teenage girls caught in the crossfire of a gang shootout in Birmingham, Mr Howells attacked \"macho idiot rappers\" for creating a culture in which \"killing is almost a fashion accessory\". It is estimated that about 800m pirate records are sold every year. The illegal copying of CDs and downloading music is putting about 600,000 music industry jobs at risk, according to Jay Berman, head of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. Following the comments by Williams, whose latest album, Escapology, is currently at number six in the UK album charts, a spokeswoman said: \"Robbie has a great sense of humour. He has made comments in the past that are rather tongue in cheek.\" \u00b7Read the Kim Howells debate in full here"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
