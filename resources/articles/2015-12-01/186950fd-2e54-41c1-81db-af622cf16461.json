This year, one of the most recognisable voices in Australian jazz, Vince Jones, will be joined by musicians Matt McMahon, Ben Robertson and Tony Floyd for a special performance. Other highlights include the Hiatus Kiayote rhythm section who will bring a completely improvised stripped-back music set, while Ethiopia\u2019s Hailu Mergia has joined forces with a rhythm section made of Berlin-based Australian improvisers Mike Majkowski and The Neck\u2019s Tony Buck. Satoko Fujii and Kaze bring together two Japanese and two French musicians with sonic experimentation and spontaneous compositions.
