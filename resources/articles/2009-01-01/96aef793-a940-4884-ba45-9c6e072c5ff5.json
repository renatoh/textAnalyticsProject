Although the clubs remain apart in their valuation of the England striker, Spurs are confident their hand is strengthened by the fact that the south-coast club owe them \u00a311.5million in instalments on previous transfers. Portsmouth are due this month to pay the balance on the \u00a39m fee that took Defoe from Tottenham to Fratton Park last January\u201a a figure of \u00a34.5m, and also owe Spurs \u00a35m on the switch that Younes Kaboul made last summer and \u00a32m on Pedro Mendes's transfer in January 2006. Mendes moved on to Rangers last summer. The Tottenham manager, Harry Redknapp, was in charge at Portsmouth when Defoe joined them. He had previously worked with the striker at West Ham and said that he would block Defoe's sale were he still at Fratton Park. \"[Peter] Crouch and Defoe are a terrific partnership, that's why I bought them to play together,\" he said. \"Whether I was in a relegation battle or not, I would not sell Defoe.\" Tottenham are reluctant to pay much more than \u00a312m for the forward, whereas Portsmouth are hopeful of raising nearer to \u00a320m for a player who has made it plain that he wants to leave and rejoin Tottenham. Redknapp, who is preparing his team for tonight's Carling Cup semi-final first leg against Burnley at White Hart Lane, maintained that he \"would be surprised if the deal gets done\" but his pessimism appears to be unfounded. Redknapp has convinced his chairman, Daniel Levy, of the need to invest in the squad and to soften his recently stated stance that no major signings would be made this month, although he did concede that it was difficult for Levy to splash out on a player who was deemed surplus to requirements 12 months ago. \"There probably would be a problem and I can understand that,\" said Redknapp, on the issue of paying significantly more than \u00a39m for Defoe. \"Whatever the actual fee was, Jermain was a good buy at Portsmouth because 12 months later, he is worth much more. Portsmouth have done well out of Jermain. He has been a good signing but, as I say, I would keep him. \"It's pretty obvious that we need to buy,\" Redknapp added. \"We have a very small squad for a big club, nowhere near as big or strong as I had at Portsmouth in terms of numbers, nowhere near. I am looking at a couple of loans [in addition]. I've got a couple of terrific loans that I have a chance of doing, a couple of foreign loans.\" One of those players is the former Liverpool full-back Steve Finnan, who is at Espanyol, although the Spanish club would prefer a permanent deal. Redknapp has taken Stephen Appiah, the Ghana midfielder, on a week-long trial. Appiah, released by Fenerbahce last year, trained with the squad for the first time yesterday and could sign for Spurs as a free agent. Redknapp also has an interest in the Coventry City goalkeeper Kieran Westwood. Tottenham are in the throes of a new era, with Levy having dispensed with his sporting director system, and Redknapp outlined how the more streamlined structure would work. \"I just say to Daniel that we need to get two or three players in, I would like this player at left-back or wherever and can you see if they are interested in selling,\" he said. \"Daniel will ring the club, make an inquiry and see whether there is a deal to be done. \"I don't get involved any more in terms of wages. I haven't for 12 years. Peter Storrie did it at Portsmouth and Daniel here. They negotiate with the club, the agent and the player. If it's too expensive, they say 'No, we can't afford him' and then it's my choice to say 'OK, let's try someone else'.\" Redknapp will rest the team's captain, Ledley King, against Burnley and keep him back for Sunday's Premier League visit to Wigan Athletic, an indication of where his priorities lie and, with injuries and suspensions taking a toll, he will name Hossam Ghaly in his squad. Meanwhile the Portsmouth midfielder Papa Bouba Diop has been ruled out for three months after straining right knee ligaments in the Premier League defeat at Arsenal last month. The club's head physio, Gary Sadler, said damage to Diop's posterior cruciate ligament was a particular worry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
