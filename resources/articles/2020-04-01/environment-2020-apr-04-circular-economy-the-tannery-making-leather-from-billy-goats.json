Here, at 35C, amid the whirring of the dehumidifier and one small electric heater, hides from billy goats are stretched out on racks to dry. Strong yet silky soft to touch, the beauty of the hides lies in the details \u2013 from the natural texture of the grain to the spine marks visible down the centre of each pale brown goatskin. \u201cEvery hide is different \u2013 these patterns are almost like a fingerprint and that\u2019s exciting to see for the first time as they dry,\u201d says Millington, 31. Millington\u2019s micro-tannery near Market Harborough in the Midlands is the final step in making full use of the thousands of male or \u201cbilly\u201d goats that would otherwise be killed at birth. Although still dwarfed in size by the dairy cow sector, the UK\u2019s commercial goat-milking herd now numbers around 50,000 animals. The controversy around the killing of male dairy calves at birth has prompted efforts to find markets for the animals. But far less attention has been paid to the male billy goats being killed soon after birth. The Goat Veterinary Society estimates around 3,000 billy goat kids are slaughtered every year because they are unwanted, with only milk-producing females deemed useful. One of the few outlets for billies in the UK is goat meat distributor Cabrito, which buys goat meat from dairy farms that keep and rear their billies until around seven months old before slaughter. But before Millington\u2019s tannery, there had been no outlet for the hides, with goatskins considered a biohazard by abattoirs and mostly incinerated. Millington came into the industry by accident. Previously working in advertising, he had been trying to help his dairy farmer Dad to find a market for his goat meat when he discovered the masses of goatskins being discarded. Unable to find a facility that could process smaller, less sought-after goatskins, Millington enlisted experts at the University of Northampton to develop a bespoke tanning recipe using natural bark extracts, then set about creating his own purpose-built micro-tannery. The tanning process, which takes up to two weeks, starts when the raw hides arrive from the abattoir. They are covered in salt to preserve the skins and draw out moisture, then the traditional \u201cbeamhouse operation\u201d begins. Initially, lime powder is added to a small batch of 70 or so skins in the first drum which spins intermittently to remove the hair and plump the skin up into a thick jelly-like material. Powdered enzyme is then added to break down proteins in the skin and once in the second drum, hides are pickled with rock salt and acid solution. Finally, non-toxic mimosa bark tannins are added to colour the leather overnight. Once tanned, skins are dyed and finished at a local family-run leather finishing company and handcrafted into luxury bags, wallets, made-to-order shoes and bespoke commissions such as the aprons for staff at SILO, London\u2019s zero waste restaurant. While most leather companies won\u2019t mention that their fabric comes from livestock, Millington is totally open about the connection between leather and the food industry. All of the billies ultimately used by the tannery come from farms supplying Cheshire-based Delamere Dairy, which processes a third of the UK\u2019s goat milk. \u201cThe leather industry is so misunderstood. People don\u2019t think about where leather comes from, but it\u2019s a natural by-product. The connection between the meat and dairy system and the leather industry has been forgotten, but they are inextricably linked,\u201d says Millington, who launched Billy Tannery three years ago and now sources all his hides from Cabrito. \u201cWe\u2019re repurposing a bi-product that comes from an inherently wasteful food system to make a material that\u2019s biodegradable, natural and beautiful,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do anyone any favours to talk about the males in the dairy system, it\u2019s not in the farmers\u2019 interests, retailers\u2019, or consumers\u2019 interest to dig that much,\u201d explains Cabrito\u2019s founder James Whetlor. \u201cBut if you\u2019re a vegetarian who eats goat\u2019s cheese, you\u2019re directly contributing to a system that euthanises animals at birth, so if you care about the circular economy, the sustainability of industries and reducing the impact of your food on the planet, you should be eating goat meat,\u201d he says. Sending the hides to Millington\u2019s tannery is the \u201clast piece of the puzzle\u201d, says Whetlor, and ends another unnecessary waste in the goat dairy system. \u201c200 years ago no one would have dreamt of knocking a perfectly healthy animal on the head at birth, and 100 years ago no one would have dreamt of throwing these hides away. Small artisan production has never had the built-in waste and obsolescence which is part of the modern-day food system,\u201d he says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
