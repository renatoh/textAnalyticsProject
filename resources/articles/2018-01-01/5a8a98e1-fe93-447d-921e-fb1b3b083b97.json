Observers believe shoppers are deciding to try other styles beyond the skinny silhouette that has been so popular for more than a decade. This season styles hark back to authentic American selvedge denim and come straight-legged, stiff and in a deep indigo hue. The trend began last year on the Calvin Klein catwalk, when designer Raf Simons paired dark indigo jeans with a matching shirt for his influential debut collection for the brand. For spring/summer 2018, a host of other designers joined the fray, showing not just indigo jeans but indigo denim in general. At Tom Ford, dark denim materialised in a sharp blazer with pointed shoulders and high-waisted, wide-legged jeans. At MaxMara, a buttoned-up boiler suit came with selvedge-style turn-ups. At Versus Versace there were tonal jackets and knee-skimming skirts. The impact of the trend is already being felt on the high street. Asos reported sales of jeans were up 58% this week, compared with the same period last year, while denim dressing at the e-tailer was up 81% from 2017. Celia Cuthbert, the head of buying at Asos, said that \u201cauthentic dark, raw and untreated indigo\u201d was its biggest denim trend this season, and that while its customers still loved slim and skinny jeans, the brand was \u201cseeing more and more sales coming through from wider-leg silhouettes and straight legs\u201d. This look, similar to that immortalised by Marilyn Monroe in 1961\u2019s The Misfits and Martin Sheen in 1973\u2019s Badlands, evokes a glory time in American history when the US was the leading purveyor of denim worldwide."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
