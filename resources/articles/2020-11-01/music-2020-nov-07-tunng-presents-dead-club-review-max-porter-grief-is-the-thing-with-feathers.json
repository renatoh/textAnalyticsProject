Now there\u2019s bravery. Fortunately, Tunng bring a characteristically light touch to these tender, if not taboo subjects. The group\u2019s seven albums of gentle folktronica have ranged from pastoral horror to domestic drollery, a mix crystallised in the opening Eating the Dead, where the customs of Brazil\u2019s Wari\u2019 people are transposed to a cadaver on the kitchen table. \u201cEat the anger and the kindness,\u201d lilts singer Mike Lindsay. The genesis of Dead Club was reading Max Porter\u2019s novel Grief Is the Thing With Feathers, and the author is one of several luminaries whose words float through the album \u2013 among them the philosopher Alain de Botton, Tinariwen\u2019s founder Ibrahim Ag Alhabib, illusionist Derren Brown and anthropologist Dame Sue Black, all of whom have contributed to the band\u2019s accompanying Dead Club Podcast series. It\u2019s truly a project. There are some blunt moments among the songs, such as The Last Day, but most are empathic. A Million Colours and Carry You are loving tributes, while Swedish Death Cleaning offers practical advice: \u201cThe old toys in the shed have to go.\u201d Then there\u2019s the cheery surrealism of Death Is the New Sex, with its promise \u201cDeath is coming to fuck us all.\u201d Thanks for the reminder."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
