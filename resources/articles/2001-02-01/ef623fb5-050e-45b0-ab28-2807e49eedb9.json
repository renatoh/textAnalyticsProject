After this rip-roaring stalemate, Royle may book some time on the shrink's couch himself. \"I'm frustrated, exasperated, puzzled,\" he sighed, reflecting on a blistering eighth-minute strike from his workaholic midfielder Danny Tiatto which was cryptically disallowed for offside by the referee Alan Wiley. With both sides in relegation trouble, this could have turned into a dour, nervous, struggle. Instead, it was brimming with attacking brio, which suggested that both teams could clamber to safety, although City may need better luck to survive. Having weathered a torrid opening in which Nicky Weaver denied Hamilton Ricard and Paul Ince with his legs, Tiatto collected the ball in his own half. He tore into Boro's area and shot crisply across Mark Schwarzer into the far corner. \"I asked the referee at half-time and he said, as Tiatto shot, Andrei Kanchelskis ran across the goalkeeper's line of sight,\" said Royle. In fact the Ukrainian had been onside throughout, hovering on the edge of the area. \"He's quick, but not that quick,\" Royle quipped. The case of mistaken identity - Darren Huckerby was the City player ruled offside in the six-yard box, although he did not appear to be interfering - merely compounded City's frustration. Tiatto insisted he never had any intention of passing the ball. \"I think the video replay should embarrass the referee for the rest of his career,\" said Royle. Had Terry Venables been in a television studio rather than a post-match conference, he would surely have concurred. \"But I just can't see how a referee could ever be right,\" he said. \"How close does someone have to be to be interfering with play? If Tiatto takes the ball on and puts it across to the player who was in an offside position, what happens then? You don't know if the goalkeeper was looking for a cross, so you just have to ask whether the player was offside or not. He was. \"Funnily enough, the incident unsettled us and some of our lads thought, 'hang on, that shouldn't have happened.\"' Contrition took its toll on Steve Vickers. Alf Inge Haaland's punt was chased to the byline by Kanchelskis and, with Shaun Goater and Huckerby waiting on the edge of the area, the Boro defender speared the cross into his own net as he back-pedalled. Teessiders have not tasted defeat since their Cockney saviour arrived in December, but after Ince's header was parried, Ricard ballooned over an empty net and Keith O'Neill drilled wide from Ince's wonderful pass, they feared the worst. But, with City buckling, Cooper thumped an equaliser after a scramble at a corner. The two sides blew themselves out in the latter stages, although O'Neill's dismissal for a two-footed lunge at Gerard Wiekens four minutes from time provided a sting in the tail. Goater, thwarted by Schwarzer, should then have earned City only their second win in 16 Premiership games. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
