That was good enough \u2013 or more accurately, bad enough \u2013 for a 36-hole total of 162, five shots adrift of a club professional from Salem, Virginia, called Chip Sullivan. That was embarrassing enough for Montgomerie, but he suffered further indignity in having to spend the worst two days of his long career in the company of Matt Kuchar, who was enjoying the best two days of his career. The 32-year-old American, a former amateur star who has taken a long time to find his way in the professional game, led the field after the delayed first round finally ended yesterday morning with a five-under-par 67. He then went straight back out on the course and shot 69, for a 36-hole score of eight under. That was enough to banish any complacency there might be in European golfing circles over the outcome of forthcoming Ryder Cup. Certainly, it was enough to catch Montgomerie's attention. \"He was very impressive,\" the Scot said of Kuchar's performance. \"He only made one mistake over two days, which is tremendous effort on this course. A super nice guy and that was some super nice play. He will be a tremendous asset for the American Ryder Cup team.\" He certainly will, and he won't be the only one if star-spangled hew of the overnight leaderboard at Whistling Straits is any indication. A recurring theme of this week has been the shifting balance of power in the game, with European golf on the ascendancy and American golf in decline. Tiger Woods was lost, Phil Mickelson injured and the massed ranks of the PGA Tour content with well-remunerated mediocrity, giving the Europeans a gilt-edged chance to assert their superiority. That was the theory. The reality, however, is that the business end of the next two days will feature the likes of Dustin Johnson, Zach Johnson, Bubba Watson, Nick Watney and Bryce Molder, all American and all them perched near the lead as night fell on this stunning course on the shore of Lake Michigan. Of those, Dustin Johnson, who led the US Open earlier this summer before crumbling on the final day, will present the most serious threat to Kuchar's leadership. Zach Johnson, a former Masters winner, should not be discounted either. As for the much vaunted European challenge of Rose, Casey, Poulter, Fisher Kaymer, they were nowhere to be seen. Not exactly down amongst the dead men, but more focused for the time being on making the cut than winning a famous victory. At least Rory McIlroy, many people's idea of a tournament favourite before a ball was struck, lived up to his billing to finish on five under par after 36 holes. One under par after completing his delayed first round the Ulsterman went straight back out onto the course with renewed purpose and played the outward nine in two under to move inside the top 10. A birdie on the first, his 10th hole of the day, edged him closer to Kuchar and another at the 6th took him to five-under for the tournament. He dropped a shot on the 7th and needed to hole a 12-foot putt on his final green to avoid dropping another, but it was a fine effort from McIlroy, who had dropped three shots in his first four holes of the tournament. To come back in such a way underlined the determination and self-belief he will carry into the weekend. McIlroy will need both attributes, mind you, because this is a golf course where trouble lies in wait, especially for those who, like the youngster, are inclined to take a risk or three. McIlroy caught the eye but he shared the honour of being the leading European player with Simon Khan, winner of this year's BMW Championship at Wentworth. That victory was deemed, unkindly by some, to have been a fluke but there is little doubt the Englishman can play. He proved as much with a succession of well-struck iron shots and timely putts as he capitalised on an opening round of 69, and had a brief share of the lead with Kuchar after a birdie on 15, only to bogey the final three holes and card a 70. The question was could he stay in contention for the next two days? If the answer is no, then few will notice or care. If the answer is yes, then Khan might also play himself into contention for a Ryder Cup place. Another selection headache \u2013 just what Monty needed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
