Large, unwieldy, unable to settle on a format model anyone can agree on, and red. No, wait, not red. Whatever: You wait for ages, and then suddenly two come along at once. Here we are, second night in a row, another full two hour show. It's almost too much. But not quite \u2026 Quick! Name 10 things that you know about Kansas City off the top of your head! All right, five things. Go! Oh, for goodness' sake. Three things? All right - here's one thing to kick you off: it's where you'll find the setting for American Idol 8's second audtion show. Also it's half in Kansas and half in Missouri. In a departure from usual stats, the second night of American Idol actually improved in the ratings. So if this is evidence of the 'being nice to people due to recession and other reasons' concept season of American Idol might be onto a winner. Suddenly, everyone will start being nice. It'll be like the summer of love, but quite a lot more commercially minded. The structure, however, is, and will remain pretty much the same for these auditions - present someone you think is going to be quite good but then isn't, then a few more that might be a bit rubbish, then BAM, hit them with someone who actually has a cat's chance at crufts. The first contestant in this case, was a pretty young thing - a poor lamb named Chelsea, who promised to sing up a storm. \"I was always afraid to come out for American Idol; I didn't think I was good enough!\" she says. And as it turns out, she should have gone with first instincts. \"You sounded like a cat falling off the top of the Empire State Building\", in by far his most caustic Simonism of the day. (And pretty much his last. Of which more, later) and wingman Randy joins in \"And then when the cat hit the bottom, there was something driving past with a siren\". That's the problem with everyone thinking they can be Christina Aguilera: they end up inserting crazy runs into everything until the tune is nowhere to be found. Usually in an audition show they might have a few more terrible acts to show how difficult the search is and what a tough time the judges have and how they almost lost hope before \u2026 etc. But not this time. There are less audition shows -and we have to squeeze in as many uplifting stories and unearth as much hidden talent as possible. So on to Ashley Anderson, who is both a perfect example of marketable alliteration AND helpfully cute to boot (that's marketable assonance, right?), is more of a tip for the top. Granted, her luck might have been tipped slightly by picking a song written (in part) by Simon Cowell and performed by Leona Lewis. But also by being remarkably confident, poised, and despite having a haircut that made her look a little like Cher (at 45) she easily flew through to the Hollywood stage. Soon, Casey Carlson, a girl-next-door type, if the girl who lives next to you is stunning and wears cowboy boots. And sings very well - and she looks like just the right kind of good wholesome girl that excels in these things. Until you see some of the fan sites springing up around the web for her where she appears to be - ahem - less so. Let's leave it there. Other tips for the top included a man named Asa, who sang Michael Jackson and wasn't completely terrible. There was a rapping sister duo - Asia and India - who impressed with their gumption but only one of them got through (India in, Asia out, if anyone's taking notes). Then, a lady - Lil Rounds - who had lost everything in a tornado, but could, thankfully, still belt one out like a well-tuned foghorn. She could sing, I mean. Sorry, that sounded like a euphemism for farting. Simon said he loved her. Simon, it seems, has turned into a man with a whole lot of love in his heart. In fact, far from the days when he was the catoon baddie so mean everyone was desperate to please him, his new catchphrase is a little more gummy. \"I like you.\" He says, to the contestant that comes in and sings unexpectedly soulfully. \"I like you.\" He says, to the young kid that overcomes his nerves to sing in tune. \"I like you\" He says to the housewife, the welder, the high school nerd, the man with to great back story. \"I Like you. I like you. I like you.\" Sometimes he raises the bet to \"I really like you\", but only on really special occasions. Like the man with the tearjerking tale of how his wife died four weeks before the audition, and went on to sing, as you might expect, like a man whose heart had been torn out. \"I really like you.\" Simon said. He liked Von Smith too. Von - VON? What the hell is Von short for? - might end up being a little unbearably overconfident. But he came in and took an unusual choice for a boy - Somewhere Over The Rainbow - and killed it. Simply killed it. He was brave, he was self-assured. And he was really, really loud. They all liked it. Kara said she admired his 'big instrument', and that's just CLEARLY rude, no matter which way you try to explain it away. But then, she also said he has chops. And was approximately the third of around seven mentions of chops, perhaps more. A young girl with an unexpected song choice: she had chops. A guy who was in last year's Idol? Chops. His brother: Also had chops, apparently. Over and over again. By the end of the two hours, I had developed a weird yearning for mint sauce. Kansas City, fact fans, is also famous for its They weren't all good. There was much wrongness to be found: My favourite wrong was perpetrated by Brian Hettler: a trained opera singer who turned up in an inadvisably low-cut t-shirt, medallion and leather jacket, and proceeded to shout his way through a perfectly good Aretha Franklin song - god knows what she's everdone to him - looking all the while like an angry Furby. There was him, there was a poor squeaky man with a ginger moustache and a voice like an eight-year-old girl. There was a poor fool who'd brought his own cheerleading squad, and many, many more. But bad was far outweighed by good and \u2026. By far my favourite auditionee, possibly ever .... turned out to be Anoup - another geek with a terrible haircut and worse shorts - came in with a sense of humour and a confident air without being annoying. Introducing himself as Amnoup - \"Or, if you prefer, Randy, Noup-dawg\" - he was a masters student who apparently wrote his thesis on Southern Myth and Folklore through the medium of barbeque and took Simon's ribbing on this subject (get it? BBQ? Ribs? Ha!) with good grace. And then proceeded to stun them all into submission with a soulful rendition of something dreadful by Boyz II Men or something. Simon - ever the industry man, product-minded till the end, was eyeing Noup-dog up and down like a master chef that chances upon a Prize winning Wagyyu cow that just happens to have wandered into his garden. He will make something of Noup-dog, I'm sure. He'll look nothing like the Noup-dog we met today, but still\u2026 I intend to form his fan club. Please join at your leisure. And now, there's only one audtion show left, next week, and then we're straight to Hollywood. By then, hopefully, people will have a clue who Kara is. Poor Kara. Apart from her megafan, yesterday, who liked her an awful, awful lot, everyone else has been rather blas\u00e9 about the presence of a fourth judge. In fact, the moment where she stepped out of the car to a silent crowd and had to say \"Um. I'm the new judge!\" to prompt mild cheers said it all. One day, Kara, you'll be famous too. Maybe in Hollywood."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
