She is a roaming, confident pianist, a crafter of unusual and attractive melodies, and a superior technician who, one suspects, would not be fazed by the transition to the classical concert hall. In Nottingham she led her trio through a selection of originals and a couple of standards by Thelonious Monk and McCoy Tyner. It wasn't hard to see why she had chosen music by these particular old masters: she combines Tyner's bluesy sensibility with Monk's fondness for unusual harmonic progressions and note clusters that seem to stick in the ear. While Rahman's right hand scurried about in a bright, classical manner, ripping through jangling chromatic runs and elegantly pounded ostinatos, her left hand twisted itself into surprising and occasionally painful-looking positions. As a composer, Rahman has clearly decided to make things as difficult as possible. Once or twice bassist Robin Mullarkey seemed to come unstuck, chuckling ruefully as he struggled to keep up with the knotty arrangements. The result was music too studied to evoke any genuine emotion. The preponderance of lengthy and ill-positioned rhythm-section solos was also particularly frustrating, and the audience was too often left simply stroking their chins. If anyone must shoulder the blame for this trio's failure to raise the roof, it is drummer Daniel Crosby. An absurdly busy player whose emotional detachment is quite breathtaking, he flatly refused to settle into a steady groove for longer than two bars at a time. His idea of ensemble playing was to take every rhythmical idea played by Rahman and immediately echo it back to her on his drum-kit, with an additional flourish. This was distracting enough on the faster bop pieces, but during the slow, meditative passages his incessant pitter-pattering frankly made me want to snatch the sticks out of his hand and break them over his head."}, "isHosted": false}}}
