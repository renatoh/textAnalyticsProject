About 400 workers are expected to travel on coaches from construction projects in the north of England including the Lyndsey oil refinery, the site of one of the wildcat strikes which spread across the country in February. More planned to come from Newcastle, Liverpool, Teesside, Wales and Scotland, according to a spokesman for rank and file members of the construction branch of the trade union Unite, who are organising the unofficial action. \"We are targeting the Olympic site because it is the highest profile construction project in the UK,\" said the spokesman, who asked not to be named for fear that he will be blacklisted by employers. \"Across the country construction workers are concerned they are not getting a fair deal. We will be calling for 100% direct employment on the Olympic site and we don't want to see any agency workers.\" After some Lindsey oil refinery protesters rallied behind the slogan \"British jobs for British workers\" the organisers of tomorrow's protest insist they have no problem with foreign labour, but are protesting against the use of agencies partly because they allow contractors to exploit migrant labour by paying low wages. But Kenny Ward, a union activist who led protests at the Lindsey refinery, said it was about the use of foreign workers \"without giving British workers a look- in\". He added: \"I have colleagues who have been offered work as bricklayers through agencies at \u00a37 per hour which is 50% lower than the national average.\" The Olympic Delivery Authority said 70% of workers on site are from the UK and Ireland while the remaining 30% represent the diversity of the local area. It said the protesters did not represent the Olympic site workers. \"We are providing jobs and training at a difficult time for the economy, exceeding our targets on the employment of local people,\" a spokesman said. \"We work closely with the UK Borders Agency to ensure all those working on site are legally entitled to do so. There are high levels of direct employment on the Olympic Park and we have a positive agreement with the unions representing construction workers on site which includes national wage rates.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
