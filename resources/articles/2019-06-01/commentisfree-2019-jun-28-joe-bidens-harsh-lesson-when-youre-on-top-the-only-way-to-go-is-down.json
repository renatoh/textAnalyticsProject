Thursday night\u2019s debate in Miami wasn\u2019t exactly substantive. Nor was it elevated. But it was reliably entertaining, far more so than Wednesday\u2019s debate (on which our broken clock of a president had an accurate take). And it did provide useful insight into the differences among the candidates and how the race might unfold. The two most obvious observations are: Joe Biden performed miserably, while Kamala Harris was in excellent form. The standout moment of the night was a jaw-dropping exchange between Harris and Biden on segregation and busing. Harris told Biden that she had been hurt by his nostalgic recollections of relationships with racist senators. She pointed out that he fought against busing in the 1970s, an issue that was deeply personal for her, as she had been bused as a child. She spoke movingly about the pain caused by Biden\u2019s stances. It was an opportunity for Biden to show some thoughtfulness and contrition over one of the ugliest parts of his political history. He did not take that opportunity. Instead, he accused Harris of smearing him: \u201cIt\u2019s a mischaracterization of my position. I did not praise racists.\u201d But Biden has indeed praised racists \u2013 he gave a glowing eulogy at the funeral of infamous segregationist Strom Thurmond. Biden then had the audacity to frame his opposition to busing as a \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d issue; he had not opposed busing, he said, merely the federal government\u2019s attempt to force racial integration. Harris forcefully rejected this spin, noting that the whole point of federal action on civil rights is to override the inaction of racist local governments. But she could have gone further. Biden was simply lying about his history. He had actually said that \u201cbusing is a bankrupt concept\u201d, and recently-revealed documents show he actively sought the support of segregationists on the issue. It\u2019s not surprising that Biden declined to apologize to or even empathize with Harris. As a general rule, Biden does not apologize, even for egregious remarks. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry for anything I have ever done,\u201d he has said. He also declined on Thursday to clarify or reframe his recent remark that \u201cnothing would fundamentally change\u201d for the wealthy if he became president. He reaffirmed that he is offering a backward-looking politics that wishes to \u201crestore the backbone of America\u201d, making the absurd claim that Donald Trump is the \u201conly president in our history\u201d who has \u201cequated racists and white supremacists with ordinary and decent people\u201d and \u201cengaged and embraced dictators\u201d. (Has he ever read a book on American history?) It\u2019s still not actually clear whether this tendency will hurt him. In a way, it\u2019s all part of the \u201cBiden brand\u201d, and older voters may not be repulsed in the way that younger and more progressive factions in the Democratic party are. Yet even those most blas\u00e9 about Biden\u2019s tendency to make appalling remarks (and then double down on them) will be disappointed by his debate performance. Much of the time, he seemed lethargic, almost indifferent. Harris, on the other hand, was confident and pressed her case with verve. She spoke vividly about the consequences of climate change and the lives of immigrants and challenged Biden on the Obama adminstration\u2019s deportation record. (Unfortunately, her actual record on immigration somewhat departs from her stirring humanitarian rhetoric, and she has shown a willingness to fabricate her history on the issue.) It also became clear that Harris is now presenting herself as firmly on the \u201cSanders left\u201d. She was the only candidate other than Sanders himself to advocate eliminating the private insurance industry, and condemned the influence of the rich and powerful more aggressively than almost any other candidate. Harris\u2019 economic populism may be difficult to swallow given her history, but it\u2019s clear that she intends to compete for the supporters of Sanders and Warren. Bernie Sanders was his usual self, thunderously denouncing America\u2019s grotesque inequality. His performance was neither outstanding nor disappointing. Sanders\u2019 best moment came during the debate\u2019s brief section on foreign policy, where he highlighted his opposition to the Iraq war, his success in getting the Senate to end US support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s bombing of Yemen, and the need to maintain peace with Iran. He forcefully defended abortion rights, but missed an opportunity to talk about racial justice. He was, as usual, needlessly cagey on the question of whether Medicare For All will raise people\u2019s taxes. He should get better at stating up front that it will, and then discussing why people still come out ahead on the bottom line, rather than appearing to have something to hide. He also gave a frustratingly vague answer on how he would implement Medicare For All, saying that he\u2019d implement it by mobilizing a social movement. It would be nice if he pointed out that there are serious policy thinkers who are working on the design and funding of single-payer healthcare. Otherwise he makes room for critics who say he is impractical and utopian. Few of the other candidates got much of a chance to distinguish themselves. Pete Buttigieg was polished and articulate, especially as he talked about how his military background informed his support for stricter gun controls. But, in a Democratic field overstuffed with bland white guys, he needed to live up to his hyped reputation as a political wunderkind. That he didn\u2019t do, and he was somewhat blindsided when Eric Swalwell (of all people) effectively challenged him on his failure to discipline his municipal police chief and his misleading remarks about his power to do so. Andrew Yang briefly plugged his basic income scheme, but was given little airtime. John Hickenlooper was most effective when emphasizing specific accomplishments in government, but lapsed back into lazy warnings about \u201csocialism\u201d. Swalwell distinguished himself mostly by the number of times he demanded that we \u201cpass the torch\u201d to a new generation. Michael Bennet did not say a single memorable word. Kirsten Gillibrand appeared to be reading every sentence from a teleprompter, though it was impossible for this to be the case. Marianne Williamson gave the most \u201cunique\u201d answers. Asked about her first policy priority, she said she would make a congratulatory phone call to the president of New Zealand. Her closing statement was a somewhat charming tribute to the political importance of love. These will get her labeled something of an eccentric, but she also made the most powerful moral case against the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies, calling them \u201ccollective child abuse\u201d and making the important point that \u201cif your government does it that doesn\u2019t make it any less of a crime\u201d. The candidates were generally impressive in their pro-immigration sentiments. Joe Biden was caught off guard when he was asked why the Obama administration had deported so many millions of people. On a day when prominent Democrats have capitulated on the issue, it\u2019s not clear how many of them will back up tonight\u2019s words with substantive commitment to immigrant rights. The debate had so many speakers and so many issues in so little time that not much could happen beyond crosstalk and quick bursts of campaign rhetoric. At least climate change was discussed, albeit briefly. None of the candidates from the \u201cback of the pack\u201d did much to move forward. Harris certainly proved that she may be a formidable challenger to Sanders and Warren, not to be underestimated. Biden showed himself unprepared and vulnerable, though it\u2019s not clear how it will affect his support. He affirmed that his politics are retrograde and ignorant of the urgency of racial and economic justice. Sanders continued to draw the debate in the right direction, emphasizing the struggles of working people and the need for sweeping, rather than piecemeal, political change to build a better and more just society.
