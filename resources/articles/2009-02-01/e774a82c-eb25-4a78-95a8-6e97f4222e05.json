Sitting in the office of an immigrants' rights advocate, they told reporter after reporter about their cause: They were protesting the separation of families brought on by immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) raids in which undocumented parents are arrested, held in detention centres and deported, while their US-born kids are left behind as virtual orphans. But the Sozas aren't professional immigrant activists \u2013 they are the devastated children, ages 12 and 9, of a Nicaraguan woman who was arrested as she returned from dropping off the kids at a school bus stop. Three days into the hunger strike, photographers captured Cecia and Ronald, weakened and teary-eyed, as they were told that their efforts were in vain: Their mother had been flown off to Managua. Heartbreaking as that story is, it is hardly uncommon since deportation raids started in 2002 \u2013 and now we know why. As reported recently in the New York Times, newly available records show that ICE, given some $625m by Congress to round up undocumented criminals and people with outstanding deportation orders, has instead spent the money rounding up working moms and dads, destroying families in the process. Of the 96,000 people rounded up, nearly 75% had no criminal record. Worse still, ICE, the department of homeland security's investigative and enforcement arm, did this on its own, without asking Congress for a legislative change, according to administrative memos that form the backbone of a scathing report released by the Migration Policy Institute last week. Given yearly quotas by Congress to pick up the most dangerous of criminals, ICE officials quietly shifted focus to pick the easiest targets and rack up arrest numbers. This is another infuriating example of the Bush administration's balls-out rogue way of doing business and yet another spectacular example of how it constantly spoke out of both sides of its mouth. On one hand, George Bush championed immigration reform bills that would give undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship. On the other hand he was ingratiating himself with the conservative Republican base by giving ICE agents a green light to indiscriminately enter homes and crush lives. That the immigrants themselves bear responsibility for this is a fact. They chose to enter the country illegally, even if many had the best of reasons \u2013 a desperate attempt to make a better life for themselves and their families. But that does not erase the fact that ICE has created a humanitarian crisis. Potentially thousands of kids who have watched armed agents bust into their homes and drag their parents away and deport them are now in foster care or sleeping in the spare bedrooms and couches of relatives. It's heartbreaking and, for a country that calls itself a nation of immigrants, disgraceful. Last May, Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza, the leading national Latino advocacy group, testified in front of the House of Representatives' committee on education and labour about the effects of the raids on kids, as found by an NCLR study: \"The report found evidence of increased economic hardship, social stigma, fear, isolation, family separation, disruptions in schooling and negative emotional and mental health consequences for children,\" she said. \"Across the communities examined in the report, teachers, caregivers and mental health professionals consistently described children with symptoms of depression and other psychological disturbances such as sleep disturbance, loss of appetite, fearfulness, mood swings and feelings of abandonment by their parents.\" New homeland security chief Janet Napolitano has ordered a review of ICE's operations, which is encouraging. But that's not enough. What's needed is comprehensive immigration reform, now. It's in the best interest of this country socially and economically, and if the worsening economy didn't have a chokehold on the president's agenda and that of the media, at the cost of all else, the revelation of ICE's actions would be front and centre. It still should. The US has ignored immigration issues for far too long. Sadly, the revelations barely made a dent in the national consciousness taken up by the lack of jobs, self-serving bankers and Tom Daschle's taxes. Meanwhile, kids continue to be traumatised."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
