The gloom that engulfed the club at the back end of last season has faded and Neil Adams, the man whose position was under scrutiny during that dreadful period, can look at the table with some early satisfaction after another impressive victory. Brentford can count themselves unlucky at the margin of defeat, given the numerous saves John Ruddy was forced to make, but three days after they had dismantled Cardiff in the second half Norwich repeated the trick here. Neither team was showing much quality for the first hour but once Alex Tettey scored in the 68th minute \u2013 capitalising on some poor defending from James Tarkowski \u2013 there was no stopping City, Cameron Jerome adding another two to extend his side\u2019s unbeaten league run to six matches. Jerome\u2019s third was a pearler and this performance was another example of what a shrewd purchase he could prove to be. Tettey and Wes Hoolahan were also a cut above the rest and, although Nottingham Forest will return to the Championship summit if they beat lowly Fulham on Wednesday, Adams was able to reflect on an excellent start to the campaign. Asked how important it was to start well after relegation from the Premier League, he said: \u201cYou have to. As Fulham have found, it\u2019s really tough. It\u2019s not easy, you have to go about your business in the right way and we\u2019re delighted with how it\u2019s gone so far. \u201cAnyone can beat anyone in this division, Brentford will take plenty of points off teams. There are different tests and we\u2019ve had all possible tests now. Brentford and the crowd are going to give teams big problems here, pleasingly we seem to be coming through it.\u201d Brentford missed opportunities in the first half but in truth it was Ruddy, rather than their own profligacy, who proved decisive. The goalkeeper denied Alan McCormack with a fine fingertip save and then kept out Alex Pritchard shortly before half-time. Pritchard was tackled inside the opposition penalty area soon after Tettey had slotted under David Button to open the scoring but Jos Hooiveld\u2019s challenge was deemed legal by the referee, Tim Robinson, amid penalty appeals. Mark Warburton, the Brentford manager, was furious and said in future he could be inclined to put more pressure on officials. \u201cI\u2019ve apologised to the players and said maybe we\u2019ve been too respectful [to the officials] tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed. If one of our players dived I\u2019d be all over him like a rash. I don\u2019t want us to be regarded as \u2018little old Brentford\u2019; we\u2019re better than that. If I\u2019m the only one who thinks that\u2019s a penalty, then I need to go to Specsavers.\u201d Jerome headed in off the post with 15 minutes remaining but saved his best to last, firing into the top corner from 25 yards out to send Norwich to the top of the table in style."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
