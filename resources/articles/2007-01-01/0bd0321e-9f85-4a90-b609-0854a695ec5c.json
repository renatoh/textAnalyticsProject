See none of these well-appointed coupes for a week and you'll know that the recession is biting hard. Count three in any 10-minute period and you can confidently reckon that it's simply raining money out there. Either that or you're in Cheshire, which pretty much amounts to the same thing. Originally launched in 1999, the TT offered, in sporty form, a hard-to-achieve twist that Audi had been managing for years with saloons: prestige without too much vulgarity. Its sweet, passive-aggressive shape proved popular with well-heeled women, but more popular with men, and in particular with optimistic bachelors in search of an automobile equivalent of the Lynx effect. Even now, it would come as no shock to breathe deeply in the TT's wake and pick up more than a hint of liberally applied body spray. This successor is only mildly altered to the eye but underneath it has an all-new steel and aluminium structure, which makes it lighter and means it springs forward faster than a glob of paper off an elastic band. And it remains, of course, a formidably well thought-out and gloriously unnecessary car. Its gesture towards a rear cabin space is an extremely token one, to the point where a couple of seven-year-olds that I wedged into it complained about the leg room. According to all the trusted parenting manuals, complaining about leg room isn't supposed to happen until a child reaches nine, at the very earliest, and it was disconcerting to witness the Audi TT producing this unnatural, hothousing effect. Then there's the optional Quattro system, which offers permanent four-wheel drive, ensuring that your TT sticks to the road so firmly that it would have to be prised off with chisels in the event that you needed to change a tyre. Indeed, so firmly does the car adhere to the surface, you start to wonder whether, under particularly aggressive acceleration, there might come a point at which the TT would cease to go forwards and begin tunnelling its way underground instead. Four-wheel drive will also, of course, sort you out in tricky terrain, which is why it might be a handy thing for a farmer to have on a Land Rover but why one has to puzzle slightly over how essential it might be on a banker's low-lying boy-toy. Still, it was reassuring to know that, in the unlikely event of my Audi TT becoming submerged in a rice paddy, I could almost certainly have extracted myself with one firm stamp on the accelerator. My version was also automatic, which again seemed to be slightly beside the point. Isn't the prime pleasure of driving a sports car the sensation, however illusory, of control? And isn't that sensation most vividly provided by wrestling with a tiny gear stick and abruptly going from sixth to second, with the engine screaming in protest, just to annoy your neighbours? Still it was effortlessly powerful and, of course, magnetically smooth. Bachelors will approve.
