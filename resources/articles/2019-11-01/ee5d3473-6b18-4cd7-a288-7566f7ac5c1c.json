Arguing that Ofsted is widely supported by parents and a key driver of rising standards, the Conservatives say they will increase the duration of the standard inspection, known as section 5, for secondary schools and large primaries from two to three days, and raise Ofsted\u2019s budget by \u00a310m. A spokesperson for the party said the extra day would be used to focus on \u201cbehaviour, bullying and a school\u2019s extracurricular offer,\u201d including sport and physical education, and designed to \u201creassure parents that all aspects of their child\u2019s school are properly evaluated\u201d. A Conservative government would also seek to abolish the exemption from routine inspection for schools previously rated as \u201coutstanding\u201d by Ofsted, a measure introduced by Michael Gove as education secretary. It would pilot making all inspections \u201cno notice\u201d, removing the requirement for Ofsted to inform schools the day before an inspection begins. Many of the proposals would be strenuously opposed by the major teaching unions as well as the more moderate head teachers groups, the National Association of Head Teachers and the Association of School and College Leaders, which have both been critical of Ofsted\u2019s role and the stress it puts on school leaders. Labour and the Lib Dems included plans to overhaul and reform school inspections in England in their manifestos, with both opposition parties intent on replacing Ofsted with more local oversight. Angela Rayner, Labour shadow education secretary, told her party\u2019s conference: \u201cIn too many cases, Ofsted\u2019s judgments and grades reflect the affluence of a school\u2019s intake and the social class of its pupils \u2013 not the performance of the school.\u201d In announcing the Conservatives\u2019 policies, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said: \u201cOfsted is an independent and trusted source of information for parents and teachers and their inspections help to raise standards in our schools. \u201cBut Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour want to scrap Ofsted, meaning parents won\u2019t have reliable information about the performance of their child\u2019s school. Without independent inspections school standards would fall and our children would be less safe. \u201cA Conservative government will back Ofsted with more funding to carry out better and more focused inspections, so that parents have more reliable information about their child\u2019s school, and school standards are driven up across the country.\u201d But Layla Moran, the Lib Dems\u2019 shadow education secretary, said: \u201cThe Ofsted brand is fundamentally broken. It creates a huge unnecessary workload and stress for both pupils and teachers. It needs to be replaced with a schools watchdog that parents and teachers can trust.\u201d The proposal to remove the exemption from inspection for outstanding schools will be more warmly greeted, including by Ofsted\u2019s chief inspector Amanda Spielman, who has said it has meant there are \u201creal gaps in our knowledge about the quality of education and safeguarding\u201d in some schools. Figures produced by the National Audit Office earlier this year showed that hundreds of schools have not been inspected in the past eight years, and nearly 300 had not been inspected for a decade. But under the Conservative plans, good and outstanding schools would be exempt from Ofsted\u2019s timetable of one-day section 8 inspections to allow resources to be concentrated on the proposed three-day inspections. The policies would only apply to schools in England. Education policy is devolved to national assemblies, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all having different systems of school inspection or accountability."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
