While a mysterious investor is on the verge of buying the Bees, Scott has already done some good business this summer. Brentford could turn out to be this season's Peterborough, competing for promotion again. Prediction Play-off potential Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Manager Russell Slade One to watch Dean Cox, 21 Construction is under way on the Falmer Stadium that will release Brighton fans from the dispiriting Withdean. Experienced players such as Liam Dickinson have joined and Slade will be hoping there is no repeat of last season's final-day escape from relegation. Prediction Mid-table mediocrity Bristol Rovers Manager Paul Trollope One to watch Jeff Hughes, 24 Survival could be plain sailing for the Pirates, provided they avoid the poor starts that have hampered recent seasons. One of the league's smaller squads has seen few additions thus far but the prolific striker Rickie Lambert remaining at the Memorial is vital. Prediction Mid-table mediocrity Carlisle United Manager Greg Abbott One to watch Gary Madine, 18 Replacing the 16 goals scored by Watford signing Danny Graham is proving difficult. Sunderland's Martyn Waghorn declined a move to Brunton Park, while former Blues striker Karl Hawley chose League Two Notts County. Carlisle could be heading for that division. Prediction Risking relegation Charlton Athletic Manager Phil Parkinson One to watch Jonjo Shelvey, 17 Keeping hold of the mercurial Shelvey has to be the Addicks' No1 priority if they are to return to the Championship. Releasing Matt Holland and losing Mark Hudson to Cardiff leaves what proved to be a poor side last season looking dangerously threadbare. Prediction Mid-table mediocrity Colchester United Manager Paul Lambert One to watch Sam Corcoran, 18 Goals could be hard to come by in north Essex. The sale of Irish striker Mark Yeates to Middlesbrough has been compounded by yet another hamstring injury for record signing Steven Gillespie. The \u00a3400,000 forward started eight league games last season. Prediction Mid-table mediocrity Exeter City Manager Paul Tisdale One to watch James Dunne, 19 On course for their third successive promotion the Grecians must prepare for their first season in the third tier since 1993-94 without Matthew Gill and Dean Moxey, who have joined Norwich and Derby respectively. Consolidation will be improvement enough. Prediction Mid-table mediocrity Gillingham Manager Mark Stimson One to watch Curtis Weston, 22 Too good for League Two, not good enough for the Championship \u2013 League One seems to be the Gills' natural home. A stirring finish to last season was capped by a Wembley triumph and Stimson has cleared out a lot of dead wood, suggesting a lack of complacency. Prediction Mid-table mediocrity Hartlepool United Manager Chris Turner One to watch James Brown, 22 Seven signings this summer illustrates director of sport Turner's eagerness to avoid a repeat of last season's final-day escape from relegation. However, poor pre-season form and the departure of Michael Nelson, to Norwich, do not inspire confidence. Prediction Risking relegation Huddersfield Town Manager Lee Clark One to watch Alex Smithies, 19 Everyone, it seems, rates Clark highly as a manager and this season gives the former Newcastle midfielder a chance to live up to expectations. Ambitious owner Dean Hoyle has provided the funds; now it is up to the Terriers to show more consistency than last term. Prediction Possible promotion Leeds United Manager Simon Grayson One to watch Robert Snodgrass, 21 Leeds look weaker after a summer of very low-key and cheap signings. Grayson, however, is reassuringly calm and shrewd. Clubs in this division still see Leeds as a scalp to be had, a phenomenon they finally showed signs of coping with last spring. Prediction Possible promotion Leyton Orient Manager Geraint Williams One to watch Jimmy Smith, 22 Short on goals last season the O's have added Romanian goal-getter Adrian Patulea and James Scowcroft from Crystal Palace. Hitting Newcastle for six in pre-season is a good sign but Orient are one of the poorest teams in maybe the wealthiest ever League One. Prediction Mid-table mediocrity Millwall Manager Kenny Jackett One to watch Nadjim Abdou, 25 Never a profligate club, transfer activity in South Bermondsey has been even slower than usual, which may suggest Jackett's satisfaction with the squad that lost last year's play-off final. Only one or two signings from becoming genuine contenders. Prediction Champions MK Dons Manager Paul Ince One to watch Jemal Johnson, 24 They say never go back but they may not have had Pete Winkelman as a boss. Ince's less than glorious return to the model town has been celebrated by significant outlay on new players \u2013 just as well as it may be a case of evolve or get left behind for the Dons. Prediction Play-off potential Norwich City Manager Bryan Gunn One to watch Cody McDonald, 23 Since being appointed on a permament basis Gunn has steered clear of loan signings and brought in 11 players on permanent deals, most with experience of the lower leagues. Their 19,000 season-ticket holders expect an immediate return to the Championship. Prediction Play-off potential Oldham Athletic Manager Dave Penney One to watch Dean Furman, 21 Unveiling plans for a new ground last month, chief executive Simon Corney said going to Boundary Park was \"not a pleasant match-day experience\". Last season's erratic form will not have helped but the new manager, Dave Penney, comes with a good reputation. Prediction Mid-table mediocrity Southampton Manager Alan Pardew One to watch Adam Lallana, 21 Things are getting better on the South Coast, partly because they could not get worse. A new Swiss owner providing financial stability and a manager who, whether he likes it or not, is renowned for his ability at this level offer real hope despite starting on minus 10 points. Prediction Play-off potential Southend United Manager Steve Tilson One to watch Lee Sawyer, 19 The Shrimpers are running the risk of proving last season was above and beyond expectations by failing to strengthen their squad. Tilson knows this small group of players as well as a manager can after nearly six years in charge, but losing defender Peter Clarke is a blow. Prediction Mid-table mediocrity Stockport County Manager Gary Ablett One to watch Michael Raynes, 21 It says a lot about the mad summer the Hatters have had that rumours linking Fabrizio Ravanelli with the vacant managerial role barely made headlines. Administration avoided, new owners in place and a former Liverpool full-back installed as manager. Prediction Risking relegation Swindon Town Manager Danny Wilson One to watch Lloyd Macklin, 18 Two days to the start of the season and Billy Paynter remains the Robins' only fit striker. Goals were not the problem last season, thanks to Simon Cox, but the \u00a32m earned from his move to West Brom has been invested in defence. Nil-nil could be a common scoreline. Prediction Mid-table mediocrity Tranmere Rovers Manager John Barnes, far left One to watch Terry Gornell, 19 More a comedy act than a football club after a close season in which they sacked a manager, Ronnie Moore, who took them within minutes of a play-off place, installed a new man with no experience of lower league football and then put themselves up for sale on eBay. Prediction Mid-table mediocrity Walsall Manager Chris Hutchings One to watch Mark Bradley, 21 Unsurprisingly the Saddlers have not splashed the cash this summer and apart from a few loanees and free transfers Hutchings will have to make do with last year's squad \u2013 despite the \u00a3600,000 received from Cardiff for Anthony Gerrard. Troy Deeney's goals will be vital. Prediction Mid-table mediocrity Wycombe Wanderers Manager Peter Taylor One to watch Joe Cobb, 18 Steve Hayes seems to have gained ownership of the club after a fractious summer the Chairboys could have done without. Taylor is adept at this level and he has wheeled and dealed with gusto, though a recent spate of injuries has left the squad looking lean. Prediction Mid-table mediocrity Yeovil Town Manager Terry Skiverton One to watch Nathan Smith, 22 After five seasons in League One following promotion in 2005 consolidation has turned to stagnation for the modest West Country club and an even smaller budget could spell strife.
