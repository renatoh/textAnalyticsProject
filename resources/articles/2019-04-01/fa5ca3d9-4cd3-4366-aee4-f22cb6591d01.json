Barker, the British Booker prize-winning author famous for her Regeneration trilogy, is in the running for the \u00a330,000 award with The Silence of the Girls, which tells the story of Briseis, a princess who is made a slave to Achilles, the man who killed her husband and brothers. Greek myth and legend are also retold by previous winner Madeline Miller in Circe, a twist on the story of the witch who seduces Homer\u2019s Odysseus. \u201cThe two tropes perpetually given to us in myths and stories are the beautiful, captive princess, and the evil witch who is too ugly for a man and therefore sits around trying to kill men. Here, you get those completely turned on their heard and see they are living women, that the patriarchal system has written their stories for them, and what the truth could be,\u201d said chair of the judges Kate Williams. \u201cSuddenly we\u2019re asking where are the women, what do the women think about this, which was ignored to a degree even 20 years ago. Anna Burns\u2019s Milkman is doing it, too \u2013 the Troubles have been heavily covered but no one really talked about what the women were doing. We all know that history is written by the victors. These authors are pointing out these victors are men, even if women are on the winning side, because their stories have been written for them.\u201d All three stories are set in the past, but Williams was clear about their relevance to the world today, as the #MeToo movement forces a reassessment of the way in which women are both seen and see their own lives. \u201cWe are changing. We are saying that women\u2019s perceptions and histories, even in a very masculine environment such as war, are important,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat really struck us in Barker and Miller\u2019s books is what hasn\u2019t changed. Women\u2019s bodies are still being used as collateral, women are still being attacked, the rape of women is still a military tool.\u201d The shortlist is completed with three very different novels: debut Nigerian novelist Oyinkan Braithwaite\u2019s My Sister, the Serial Killer, a dark comedy set in Lagos; Diana Evans\u2019s Ordinary People, about two disaffected middle-aged couples and their families; and Tayari Jones\u2019s An American Marriage, about a young African American couple who are ripped apart when the husband is sentenced to 12 years in prison for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. Williams called the lineup \u201cfiction at its best \u2013 brilliant, courageous and utterly captivating \u2026 We fell totally in love with these books and the amazing worlds they created.\u201d Books from the 16-book longlist that did not make the cut include Sally Rooney\u2019s bestseller Normal People and Freshwater by Akwaeke Emezi, the first non-binary transgender author to be nominated for the prize since it was founded in 1996. Williams, who is professor of history at the University of Reading, is joined on the judging panel by journalists Arifa Akbar and Dolly Alderton, campaigner and psychotherapist Leyla Hussein, and digital entrepreneur Sarah Wood. The winner of the award will be announced on 5 June.
