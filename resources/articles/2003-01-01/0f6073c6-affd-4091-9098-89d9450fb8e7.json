Mr Prescott told the House of Commons that \"strikes cannot and will not achieve anything\", and asked the firefighters to \"get back to the talks at Acas. Do not put the public at unnecessary risk\". And he restated the government's position that pay and modernisation would have to go hand in hand \"regardless of further strike action\". Mr Prescott's appeal was coupled with the disclosure the government now had extra cover to help tackle blazes during a strike. \"We have robust and tested contingency plans in place to provide emergency cover,\" he revealed. \"We now have 177 red appliances to add to the capacity of the green goddesses and the specialist rescue teams - that's over 90 more than during the last strike.\" Mr Prescott described the firefighters' 11.3% two-year pay offer as a \"good offer by any standards\" and well above the average for public sector settlements. He said that the review of the fire service by academic Professor Sir George Bain still provided the best framework for a deal. \"It is that simple and this will remain the government's position regardless of further strike action.\" And he outlined how the government intended to push its modernisation agenda forward by issuing a \"new approach to fire cover\", drawn up by the chief inspector of fire services, for consultation later this month. But Mr Prescott lamented that \"unfortunately, the FBU has continued to oppose Bain's recommendations. It has made exaggerated and misleading statements about the number of job cuts and fire station closures implied by Bain without engaging seriously in negotiations with the employers\". For the Conservatives, David Davis backed Mr Prescott's call for the firefighters to call off their \"irresponsible strike action\" and welcomed the mobilisation of the extra red fire engines. He added that with a possible war in Iraq and the threat of terrorism at home, the government should seek an injunction to stop the strikes and prevent the Army being over-stretched."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
