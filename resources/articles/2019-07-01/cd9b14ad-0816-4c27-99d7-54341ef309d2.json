In May, the Sydney-based scientist and his team of 22 announced they had potentially cured the sting of the box jellyfish, the most venomous creature in the world, whose toxins cause excruciating pain as a best-case scenario, and cardiac arrest as the worst. It was a simple but groundbreaking technique, using the latest in genetics technology \u2013 Crispr, the gene-editing tool that allows scientists to make precise changes to DNA. The process is fascinating and the implications sprawl across all areas of human health. Neely\u2019s lab is expanding and looking at a grab bag of human ailments, from cancer to chronic pain. The Canadian-born professor\u2019s field is functional genomics \u2013 which is to say, anything to do with genes \u2013 with a focus on human health \u2013 which is to say, everything. His remit is as narrow as a skin cell but as wide as the concept of pain itself. He has a floor full of scientists, youngsters with niche and competing interests, international and Australian, sitting in an open-plan office at the University of Sydney\u2019s Charles Perkins Centre. After de-barbing the jellyfish, they say it is easy to do the same to spiders, snakes and rockfish. They are working on improving the effectiveness of chemotherapy on tumours. They think they have a way to dull chronic pain \u2013 in mice at least. Down the line, they hope to work on endometriosis. They are swirling venom up in test tubes in one room, growing spinal cords in another. Neely\u2019s team can pitch him anything as long as it involves genetics, improves human health, and he finds it \u201cinteresting\u201d. This means they can pitch him anything. \u201cI have been studying pain since 2003,\u201d he says. \u201cThe genetics of pain, the molecular mechanisms. How pain happens, and how it is regulated \u2013 with the idea of helping people.\u201d In 2010, Neely used fruit flies to discover 400 new genes, present in humans, that were responsible for feeling pain. The insect has 14,000 individual genes, and until then, he says \u201cthe vast majority were not tested for pain\u201d. He found 600. Two-thirds were also in humans. \u201cThat was the first step.\u201d The way Neely\u2019s team created the box jellyfish antidote is simple, once you understand it. They began with human skin cells, floating in test tubes, then added toxic jellyfish venom. \u201cWe have human cells, we add venom and it kills them all,\u201d Neely says. \u201cThat\u2019s our starting point. Total death.\u201d Then with Crispr, they slice and dice the cells, cutting out genes at random. This creates a soup of cells, all with different properties. Some are lacking X, some lacking Y. \u201cNow we have this big mixture of cells. Then we add our venom, and not everything dies. We keep adding more venom, and not everything dies. Whatever doesn\u2019t die we collect, so it\u2019s a really easy screen.\u201d It is trial and error; natural selection sped up. \u201cNow [in our new research] we are doing more complex situations,\u201d Neely says. \u201cNot just life and death. \u201cBut this one was great. We picked out all the cells that had resistance, sequenced them and identified which genes were knocked out.\u201d In the results, published in Nature Communications, the researchers found the resistant cells didn\u2019t have any cholesterol in them. If the skin cells don\u2019t die, then the sting doesn\u2019t hurt \u2013 or enter the bloodstream. Their antidote applies a mix of hydrophobic and hydrophilic elements to skin that draws the cholesterol out of the cells. The venom can\u2019t puncture it. It\u2019s so simple it can go on as a spray. The next step is to find a government to back it, and the required regulatory testing. They are cautious. It has not been tested on humans, and they want to be sure that stopping the pain also stops the other symptoms that affect the heart. But Neely can\u2019t see any immediate reason why blocking the venom on the skin wouldn\u2019t then block its progress to the heart. He wants it to go through the rigorous testing process. Since the antidote doesn\u2019t require an injection, or anything similarly invasive, it could be available quickly. \u201cIf, after the testing, you told me it was definitely OK,\u201d says Neely, \u201cwe could have it for people in a month.\u201d \u2018It cures the neuropathic pain\u2019 For Neely, this is just the beginning. The bare process \u2013 edit genes, test for resistance, collect \u2013 is easily replicable across the whole human body. His team is scurrying into different areas, united by the one goal, broadly, of a pain-free Australia. The same principle is being applied to cancer. Neely and his team are trying to improve the efficiency of chemotherapy \u2013 minimising its harmful impact on good cells, maximising its ability to kill tumours. They collected 40 of the most commonly used cancer drugs, applied them to a mix of Crispr-edited cells, and saw which ones were resistant and which ones responded. \u201cLots of times what happens is that chemotherapy wears off after a while, you get resistance to it,\u201d explains Neely. \u201cSo we\u2019re trying to map all the different ways cells can be resistant to chemotherapy.\u201d Neely speaks with footnotes. He peppers every sentence with references and tributes \u2013 to his team, to other researchers. Each sentence starts sprouting tangents, to bring others and their ideas into the story. They have tested more venoms, he says, waving his hands to different parts of the office. \u201cRaymond has done assassin bug and centipede \u2026 We have a plate of 96 venoms that we are testing right now. Sergey is going through and screening some of those. We got them all from Glenn King in Brisbane, who is basically the leader of venom research in Australia.\u201d He pays tribute to teams at Harvard, a lab in Melbourne run by Marco Herold (\u201cWe do the same thing. He\u2019s awesome\u201d), and a Dutch scientist, Thijn Brummelkamp, who he says devised the logic that led to screenings like this. He waves across the office again. Another member of his team is diving into the puzzle of chronic pain. \u201cLeslie, she took stem cells and differentiated them into new pain killing neurons, then transplanted them into mice, into the spinal cord. And it basically cures the neuropathic pain in one dose.\u201d It is a startling discovery. In July, his team published the results in the journal Science Advances. They identified that something similar to chronic pain \u2013 a poorly understood condition in humans \u2013 potentially affects insects too. Pain, in a simplistic way, works like a car. When you burn your hand, there are positive messages \u2013 that register pain \u2013 that travel up your spinal cord. But there are also brakes, negative messages, that soothe it. \u201cIf you slam your hand in your drawer, and you rub it, that is the negative,\u201d Neely says. \u201cAnd it dulls the pain.\u201d Fruit flies have the same brake as well, and if the insect suffers a serious injury, Neely\u2019s team discovered this could give them increased sensitivity. \u201cThe sensory nerves get overexcited and they basically over-activate the brakes and it kills the brakes. From now on in their lives, their brakes are gone and they are oversensitive.\u201d They believe this could be an evolutionary basis for chronic pain, and explain why humans suffer it. \u201c500 million years ago, chronic pain started out as a good thing; it allows you to escape future attacks. And now more recently it sucks for us.\u201d And early experiments on mice have fixed it \u2013 for six months. \u201cBecause these brakes are disappearing, we thought, let\u2019s put them back and see if we can cure pain. \u201cWe take stem cells and turn them into brakes, put them back in the spinal cord and it cures chronic pain.\u201d One injection removes chronic pain for at least six months. They are limited from testing that for longer, due to ethical constraints. \u201cWe now have a grant from the New South Wales government to develop that for humans within three years. That\u2019s a pretty cool new pain therapy.\u201d The possibilities spool out from this. \u201cOne person in my lab just asked if they can start spending time on figuring out the best way to research endometriosis,\u201d Neely says. He told them the first step is to figure out a good, scientifically rigorous gene test. \u2018He\u2019s leading the world\u2019 His peers agree that Neely\u2019s work is cutting-edge. The methodology is so clever it generates a kind of excitement. Prof Mark Hutchinson from the University of Adelaide is a fellow expert in pain, and says the screens Neely is doing are \u201camazing\u201d. \u201cGreg is one of Australia\u2019s top pain scientists,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no doubt he is leading the world in this space \u2026 it\u2019s amazing. Really cool technology, great insights.\u201d But, as Neely himself does, Hutchinson notes that there is a difference between pain in mice and fruit flies, and pain in people. \u201cThere is a need to create some translation components to the work. The fruit fly example \u2013 and Greg would acknowledge this \u2013 the fruit fly is only a model.\u201d Neely himself shies away from labelling the fruit fly discovery \u201cchronic pain\u201d. In his study, the fly\u2019s pain was measured by how quickly the fly reacted to stepping on a hotplate. \u201cThe definition of pain is an unpleasant emotional and sensory experience \u2013 we can\u2019t know if the fruit fly experiences the emotional component,\u201d says Hutchinson. When it comes to chronic pain \u2013 itself an already poorly understood, broad, umbrella term \u2013 those distinctly human elements are even more important. \u201cLet\u2019s call it a danger signal rather than true pain,\u201d Hutchinson says. \u201cThat is a key element, that Greg used \u2018pain\u2019 in inverted commas, which is absolutely the right way to think about it.\u201d But it\u2019s a groundbreaking first step. \u201cThe ability to do a screen like this, from the ethics perspective, being able to use a lower order species like this, it\u2019s a really great advancement,\u201d says Hutchinson. He \u2013 like many others in the field \u2013 is excited to read Neely\u2019s next paper. And away from the shadow of the headline-grabbing Crispr, the key breakthrough of Neely\u2019s work is, as Hutchinson says, simply the method, its logical cleanliness. The cleverness of applying such a simple screen to such a complex beast as pain. Crispr just makes it easier. It\u2019s a tool that lets them isolate those genes with cleaner cuts. In July, two months after his jellyfish announcement, almost everything Neely was working on has moved forward. \u201cI just started a collaboration with the UK,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cToday, there are 10 or 20 deadly African snake venoms in the mail. We\u2019re basically going to do the same with what we did with jellyfish.\u201d As always, he has been fielding new pitches from his team. \u201cWhen someone pitches a project to me, the first thing I\u2019m doing is thinking why it won\u2019t work. Then if I can\u2019t find any reason why it won\u2019t work, then I next ask, is it important?\u201d \u201cWe are willing to do anything. Taking advantage of new techniques, using the technology we have to help human health. That\u2019s the goal. It\u2019s easier said than done, but that\u2019s the goal.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
