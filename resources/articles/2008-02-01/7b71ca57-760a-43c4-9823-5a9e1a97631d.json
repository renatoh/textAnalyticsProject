A billionaire businessman and would-be politician, Patarkatsishvili was found dead at his home in Leatherhead after an apparent heart attack. Police are treating the death as suspicious. The postmortem examination is scheduled for tonight. The results will be released tomorrow. Anglo-Russian relations were badly strained after the alleged assassination on British soil of former Russian spy KGB Alexander Litvinenko. Scotland Yard believes he was poisoned with a radioactive isotope and Britain has been seeking the extradition of former FSB agent Andrei Lugovoi in relation to the killing. Police today said there was no suggestion a radioactive substance was involved in the death of Patarkatsishvili. Less than two months ago, Patarkatsishvili, who is reportedly worth \u00a36bn, had voiced concerns he would be murdered. \"As with all unexpected deaths it is being treated as suspicious,\" a police spokeswoman said. A detailed postmortem will start today. Results are expected to take some time as toxicology tests are likely. A divisive figure in Georgia, Patarkatishvili created aided street protests against the government in November. He stood against the president, Mikhail Saakashvili, in last month's snap presidential elections, but gained only 7% of the vote. He was being investigated for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government. He denied the accusations but admitted offering large sums of money to police if they sided with protesters. The demonstrations were violently broken up. Only four years earlier, Patarkatsishvili had funded the \"rose revolution\" that brought Saakashvili to power. He was part of an elite set in the UK, counting other exiled oligarchs as friends, such as Boris Berezovsky, employing former attorney general Lord Goldsmith as his lawyer, and Margaret Thatcher's PR guru, Baron Bell, as his spokesman. In 2006. Patarkatishvili and Berezovsky tried in vain to buy West Ham United football club. He had enemies abroad, one of them purportedly the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Berezovsky, who described Patarkatsishvili as his \"dearest friend\", said he had not been ill, but had complained about his heart when the pair met yesterday. His death has prompted speculation about whether or not a force more sinister than nature played a part in his heart attack. In December, Patarkatsishvili claimed he had obtained a 45-minute audiotape recording of an official in the Georgian interior ministry asking a Chechen warlord to murder him while he was in Britain or Israel, where he also had a home. Transcripts were published in the Sunday Times. \"I believe they want to kill me,\" he said. Patarkatsishvili hired Lord Goldsmith - who said he took the threat \"very seriously\" - to represent him. A top Georgian analysts said it was highly unlikely Georgia's government would have murdered Patarkatsishvili, despite the fact he was an outspoken critic of the regime. The government led by Mikhail Saakashvili did not have the capability to pull off an assassination in Britain, Zaza Gachechiladze, editor in chief of the Georgian Messenger, told the Guardian. \"I don't think he was killed by anybody in Georgia. Technically, we don't have that much possibilities. We don't have a very much sophisticated intelligence service,\" Gachechiladze said. Patarkatsishvili made his money in Russia during the 1990s, Gachechiladze said, working with Berezovsky. But the true source of his wealth was not known. \"In a transitional period money is not clean, unfortunately. Most of the money is dirty. Badri got this money but I don't know where and how he got it,\" he said. Patarkatsishvili, who lived in Russia between 1993 and 2001 and is survived by his wife and two daughters, was also wanted by the Russian authorities. He faced charges of stealing cars from Russia's largest car maker, AvtoVAZ, in the 1990s, and plotting an escape from police custody in 2001 for a business associate who was under investigation for fraud. Despite the many legal wranglings, Gachechiladze described Patarkatsishvili as a \"nice, quiet\" figure who supported numerous patriotic projects in Georgia including cancer hospitals for children, as well as chess, football, basketball and wrestling. Asked how his mild public persona fitted with his reputation as a ferociously successful oligarch, Gachechiladze said: \"Man is a harmonious entity made of disharmonious elements.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
