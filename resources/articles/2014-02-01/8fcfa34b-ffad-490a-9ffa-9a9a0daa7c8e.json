On Wednesday Guardian Australia revealed that the Immigration Department had inadvertently published the data, which contains the full names, dates of birth, nationalities and other details of a third of all asylum seekers in Australia, in a public, downloadable document on its website. Morrison said he had told the Immigration Department secretary Martin Bowles to investigate the matter and had already contracted an independent audit firm, KPMG, to review the breach. An interim report is due next week. \u201cThe information was never intended to be in the public domain,\u201d Morrison said in a statement. \u201cI am advised the department has ensured all possible channels to access this information are closed, including Google and other search engines.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is a serious breach of privacy by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. I have received a brief on this matter and have sought assurances that this will not occur again.\u201d In a later interview with ABC news, Morrison said that he had overall responsibility for the breach, he said that \u201cwhen these things occur even when obviously you don\u2019t have direct operational control over these issues you have to make sure they\u2019re addressed\u201d. Earlier on Wednesday the privacy commissioner, Timothy Pilgrim, also initiated an investigation into how the breach occurred and said the department had assured his office the data was no longer publicly available. \u201cThis is a serious incident and I will be conducting an investigation into how it occurred. As part of this investigation the department has undertaken to provide me with a detailed report into the incident,\u201d said Pilgrim. \u201cFurther, the OAIC [Office of the Australian Information Commissioner] will be working with the department to make sure they are fully aware of their privacy obligations and to ensure that incidents of this nature will not be repeated.\u201d Morrison said he welcomed the review. Labor\u2019s immigration spokesman, Richard Marles, said he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about what he described as \u201cone of the most significant breaches of privacy in Australian history\u201d. Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young also said on Monday the release of the information should be taken into account in assessing the claims of asylum seekers named. Morrison cautioned against whether the breach would have any impact on asylum claims and said it was a matter for individual review officers. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone should jump to any conclusions there, I note that some are putting that issue forward in an advocacy sense,\u201d he told ABC news. \u201cRefugee claims and assessments are done individually and in isolation to each and every case specific case.\u201d \u201cIf matters like this impact on that then that reviewer will make that call at that time, and it\u2019s not for me or anyone else to instruct or seek to influence or cajole in any way that decision."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
