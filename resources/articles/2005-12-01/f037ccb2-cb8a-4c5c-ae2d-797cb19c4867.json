It may have seemed a typical bird congregation of midwinter, but it was in fact a perpetual scene of robbery with menace. Each transgression unfolded in the same calm, almost ritualised manner. A lapwing would trot a few paces forward, bow momentarily and dip into the soil with its stubby beak. About one in eight sorties produced a worm, which instantly triggered an assault by one or more of the nearby gulls. The lapwing would flee in response and only return to earth once its worm was dropped, when the leading gull snatched up the prize. Known technically as kleptoparasitism, it intrigues me on a number of counts, such as the way the lapwings seems to accept the marauding attentions of the gulls with resigned calm. Equally mystifying is the manner in which the gulls are able to spot the tiny morsel the second that it's caught, intervene before it can be swallowed and then relocate it on the bare ground once it has been dropped. It is thought that the lapwings may benefit from the gulls' watchful attentions and their willingness to raise the alarm should a predator approach that might threaten gull or plover. Presumably the lapwings also tolerate the nuisance because it is sufficiently spread across the whole flock for it not to inconvenience unduly any individual. It is partly these exploitative tactics that have earned gulls a reputation with some people as avian thugs. But is it really justified? The scene where a child slips a hand beneath the brooding chicken to retrieve that morning's warm egg is a moment we normally drape in an aura of natural harmony. Why should the gull's bounty seem so immoral?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
