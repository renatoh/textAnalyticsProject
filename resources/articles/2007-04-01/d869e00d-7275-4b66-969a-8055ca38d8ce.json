I am guessing the interest-only option is less efficient, but don't understand why. NS A Assuming that the interest rate on the two mortgages is the same and they are both paid off over the same number of years with the interest calculated daily, there is no difference between the two methods of repayment. Overpaying on an interest-only mortgage option would only become less efficient if there was a delay in the lender using the overpayments to reduce the mortgage amount."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
