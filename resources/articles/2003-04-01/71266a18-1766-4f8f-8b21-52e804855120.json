Lieutenant General Jay Garner said that all ministries will have Iraqi officials at the helm as soon as possible. He was speaking at a news conference in Baghdad after talks with Iraqi technocrats and academics about efforts to bring democracy and stability to the leaderless country. \"You will see the governmental process begin by the end of next week,\" he said. \"It is very important that people start getting back to work, especially those in public service.\" Lt-Gen Garner said that he had a coordinator for every ministry, and will ensure that all ministries have a proper place in which to work. That includes finding new buildings, furniture and office supplies for those agencies whose offices were damaged by US and UK bombing. Among the topics discussed at the meeting was the way in which the people of Baghdad would prefer to choose a new municipal leadership to fill the vacuum created by the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime. \"Our purpose here in your country is to create an environment for you so that we can begin a process of government that leads to a democratic form in Iraq,\" Lt-Gen Garner told the 60 or so Iraqis attending the talks. He said that recent demonstrations against the US presence have been influenced by neighbouring Iran. \"Those are well-organised. I think what you find in that is a lot of Iranian influence,\" Lt-Gen Garner said, adding that he expected such protests to lessen in the coming days, and that \"you will see more favouritism towards the US\". The Shias, who make up about 60% opf Iraq's 24 million-strong population, are fast filling the power vacuum left by the ouster of Saddam. Some fear that their dominance of postwar Iraqi politics could lead to an Islamic theocracy like that in neighbouring Iran. Much of Baghdad still lacks power, water and a telephone service. Before going into the meeting, Macon Kadhim, a 60-year-old electrical engineer, said: \"If the Americans are not going to control Baghdad very quickly, we will have a serious problem. The first thing I would like to hear is that something will be done in Baghdad to restore security.\" At the news conference, Major General Carl Strock said that oil is now flowing in southern Iraq, with 175,000 barrels a day going to a refinery in Basra and to the city's power plants. In the next day or two, 60,000 barrels a day will begin flowing in the north, in addition to the natural gas that drives electric turbines for Baghdad. Lt-Gen Garner received a polite but cool reception when he came to Baghdad on Monday. He spent the following two days in Iraq's northern Kurdish region, where he is widely admired for his work in protecting the Kurds in 1991 after a rebellion was put down by Saddam's forces. He is setting up his offices at Baghdad's Republican Palace complex, which was once used by Saddam's regime. Annan sparks row calling US the \"occupying power\" In other developments, the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, today called on the US-led coalition to respect international law as the \"occupying power\" in Iraq. Mr Annan's words drew immediate ire from US officials, who resist the label \"occupier\" and say that forces are respecting the rules. He told the UN human rights commission: \"I hope the coalition will set an example by making clear that they intend to act strictly within the rules [governing the occupation of conquered nations].\" US officials, however, reacted angrily, saying they had not yet established whether the coalition that toppled Saddam Hussein's regime was the occupying power under international law, but that forces were, nevertheless, abiding by international conventions. \"We've not only made that clear by our words, we've made it clear from day one of this conflict through our actions,\" US envoy Kevin Moley told reporters. \"We find it, at best, odd that the secretary general chose to bring this to our attention.\" Mr Annan cited the 1949 Geneva conventions and the 1907 Hague convention, international accords which set down the responsibilities of occupiers, ranging from maintaining public order to collecting taxes. Possible clue to missing US airman US investigators in Iraq have found what may be a clue to the only American missing from the 1991 Gulf war: the initials of Navy pilot Michael Scott Speicher, scratched into a prison wall in Baghdad. It is unknown who carved the letters \"MSS\" into a cell wall in the Hakmiyah prison, US officials said, or whether the letters had anything to do with the missing pilot. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said an informant had reported that a US pilot was held at that prison in the mid-90s. A team of officials from the CIA and the US defence intelligence agency is in Iraq, searching for clues to Mr Speicher's fate. An attorney for the Speicher family called the news \"heartening\", and said the family remains hopeful. \"There's a lot of information indicating that Scott is alive and in captivity,\" Cindy Laquidara told MSNBC in a telephone interview. Spiritual leader resurfaces The spiritual leader of a small, radical Iraqi opposition party, who had allegedly been detained by US and British forces in Iraq after returning from exile, has resurfaced in the holy city of Kerbala, his office said today. Ayatollah Mohammad Taki al-Mudarissi appeared in Kerbala yesterday for afternoon prayers, and delivered a speech before tens of thousands of people who had gathered for a Shia pilgrimage, a statement issued by his Damascus office said. Ayatollah Mudarissi, spiritual leader of the Iran-based Islamic Action Organisation, crossed into Iraq on Monday with dozens of followers, but \"disappeared\" on the road between the border town of Khanaqin and Baghdad, in an area under the control of British forces, the statement said. It alleged that he was detained for nearly 24 hours, but officials at the Qatari headquarters for the US military operation in Iraq denied ever holding him. Spokesman Lieutenant Herb Josey said that he apparently crossed the border, was stopped for routine checks \"and allowed to continue\". The Islamic Action Organisation was blamed for many bombings and assassinations against Saddam Hussein's regime during the 80s. Many members were executed or exiled, and the organisation has dwindled in recent years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
