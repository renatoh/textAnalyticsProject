While never particularly popular in the UK, he sold millions of albums in the US and remains a staple of easy-listening radio. Critics often sneered at his earnest lyrics, mixed metaphors and lush productions, yet these qualities were exactly what listeners responded to. He was born in Peoria, Illinois. His father had led big bands while his mother was an amateur opera singer. When the Beatles arrived in the US, Fogelberg was among the millions who came under their spell. Forming bands at high school, he developed his performing skills by singing top 40 hits at parties and clubs. When he enrolled at the University of Illinois as a drama student, he thought he had put music behind him but a local coffee shop, the Red Herring, encouraged students to play acoustically and he was soon a regular performer. He was launched on his career by Irving Azoff, an Illinois native based in Los Angeles, who returned home to scout for talent and saw Fogelberg perform at a rowdy student bar. Impressed, Azoff told him: \"You're the one. I'm ready for the big time. And I think you're ready for the big time too.\" Azoff secured Fogelberg a recording contract with music mogul Clive Davis. His 1972 debut album Home Free was recorded with top session musicians in Nashville, yet failed to sell. Fogelberg spent the next year working as a session musician until Davis, who felt the debut album's production was too \"country\", lined him up with the popular rock guitarist Joe Walsh as producer for his 1974 follow-up, Souvenirs. Walsh invited along such famous friends as Graham Nash and Don Henley to sing harmonies, and Souvenirs found its way on to radio playlists, selling more than 2m copies. Fogelberg immediately launched upon a campaign of touring and recording. He played all the instruments on his 1975 album Captured Angel, producing it as well, and in the same year supported the Eagles on tour - the band now also managed by Azoff. His 1977 album Nether Lands included orchestral backing and the following year, teaming up with jazz flautist Tim Weisberg, his album Twin Sons of Different Mothers produced the US hit The Power of Gold. In 1981, his double concept album The Innocent Age featured cameos from Joni Mitchell and Emmylou Harris and produced four US hit singles. His 1984 album Windows and Walls found Fogelberg out of step in the age of MTV. Rather than change his style, he recorded High Country Snows, a bluegrass album cut with Chris Hillman, which remains one of the best-selling bluegrass albums ever. Exiles (1987) found him brooding over his recent divorce while his early 1990s albums The Wild Places and River of Souls found him focusing on environmental concerns. Fogelberg spent much of his time on his Colorado ranch or on an island he owned off the coast of Maine. The acoustic Full Circle (2003) was his last album. He retired in 2004 after being diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer. \"You've got to just follow your heart and do your best work,\" he said. \"There is no doubt in my mind or heart that everything I've done is exactly what I intended to do.\" He is survived by his wife Jean. \u00b7 Daniel Grayling Fogelberg, singer-songwriter, born August 13 1951; died December 16 2007"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
