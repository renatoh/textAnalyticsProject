But many who cherish it for its wildlife, for its fishing, or simply as a chalk stream to stroll by on a summer evening, must be dismayed by reports that the river Kennet is at present reduced at points to little more than a trickle. \"Parallel with the street,\" wrote the topographer HW Timperley in the 1930s, \"and a bowshot from it, the Kennet rolls its deep and clear chalk waters beneath the bowery margins of a score of pleasant gardens ...\" Not now it doesn't. This same stretch of the river, lovingly commemorated by Betjeman, who was at Marlborough College, has become a miserable spectacle. Richard Benyon, the minister for such matters, through whose Newbury constituency the river flows, said in the House that he'd found its bed as dry as the Commons carpet. Inadequate rain is only part of the story. The Environment Agency blames \"channel modification, diffuse pollution, invasive species and abstraction pressures\", and the Action for the River Kennet campaign has been urging the minister to reduce the amount that Thames Water is permitted to take from it. Edward Thomas, like Betjeman, celebrated this river, while a previous poet laureate, Southey, rated the beer produced with the help of its water the best in the land. The brewery went long ago. It would be a far greater tragedy, were part of the Kennet to meet the same fate. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 December 2011. The original said the Kennet joined the Thames at Sonning Lock. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
