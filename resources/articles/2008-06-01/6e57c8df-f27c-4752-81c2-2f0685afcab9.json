The second trial of Phorm's server-side adware system has been much delayed since BT's relationship with Phorm came to light in February; it transpired that the broadband provider did not get the permission of the 36,000 customers who were included in the first trial, in September and October 2006, which may technically have breached the law. Richard Clayton, a security expert at the University of Cambridge, has called for BT to be prosecuted for intercepting peoples' communications without their permission. This time around, BT is being much more careful, gaining the permission of those taking part, and making sure the tests are completely legal. It says it will announce the date of the trial on its site, at bt.com/webwise, and forums at beta.bt.com/bta/forums A document that has surfaced at the Wikileaks site, and confirmed to be valid by BT, claims that in the first trial \"no BT customer helpdesk calls were received which were directly attributed to a defect of the PageSense [Phorm] system\". This, though, is misleading, because a number of people did notice redirections via a Phorm-owned site, and called BT to express concerns. However, that didn't mean the Phorm system was broken; it was working as designed. One criticism of BT that has arisen from the report is that it made it sound as though Phorm-bought adverts had replaced paid-for adverts for charities: \"the [Phorm-bought] adverts were used to replace a 'default' charity advertisement (one of Oxfam, Make Trade Fair or SOS Children's Villages) when a suitable contextual or behavioural match could be made by [Phorm's] PageSense system\". But BT insisted this week that Phorm had not replaced any ads bought by charities: \"It's as if we had bought 100 billboards but only been able to put ads on 80 of them for traditional products, so we put charity ads on the other 20,\" said a spokesman. \"The charity ads wouldn't have been shown otherwise.\" Pressure against server-side ad-targeting seems to be growing in the US, where 15 pro-privacy organisations have written to the House of Representatives demanding public hearings on the use of such technologies by companies such as Phorm, NebuAd and Front Porch. Charter Communications, a US ISP, plans to start testing NebuAd's system, which resembles Phorm's, later this month on a few hundred customers. The European Commission, meanwhile, told The Register website this week that it is considering an intervention after the Information Commissioner decided not to take any action against BT over the earlier Phorm trial. \"We are continuing to monitor this closely,\" an EC spokeswoman said. \"If need be we will take action.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
