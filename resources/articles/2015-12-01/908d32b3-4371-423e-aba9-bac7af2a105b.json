Try as they might \u2013 and Aitor Karanka\u2019s side tried very hard \u2013 Middlesbrough could never quite get to grips with either Deulofeu\u2019s exquisite wing play or Romelu Lukaku\u2019s command at centre-forward. Karanka regards his good friend Roberto Mart\u00ednez as a mentor and role model and Everton\u2019s manager duly offered Boro a masterclass in technical proficiency and imaginative ambition as goals from Deulofeu and Lukaku \u2013 who else? \u2013 separated the sides. Demonstrating that it really is possible to combine multiple stepovers with high efficiency \u201cend product\u201d the former Barcelona prodigy created Lukaku\u2019s goal in such audacious fashion that Boro never quite recovered. \u201cA very satisfying performance, reaching the semi-finals is a terrific feeling,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez. \u201cIt was a really special atmosphere, the home crowd created a quite incredible environment but we coped with a very good, sophisticated, Middlesbrough side who deserve to be in the Premier League. \u201cWe scored two magnificent goals but I don\u2019t get impressed with Gerard because I see him train every day. He has a natural talent that\u2019s as good as it gets, that players dream of having and anyone would pay to watch. He\u2019s phenomenal.\u201d The game\u2019s quick tempo befitted an occasion when everything seemed amplified. A ground accustomed to housing its share of empty seats for Championship fixtures was packed to near capacity, the decibel count had heightened appreciably and the evening felt electrified by a collective adrenaline surge. Two of the most detached individuals inhabited the technical areas. While Mart\u00ednez had balanced his desire to win this cup against the need to prevent key performers burning out by making three changes from Everton\u2019s last game, Karanka proved even more coolly calculating, refreshing six positions ahead of Friday\u2019s important league game at Ipswich. Such alterations failed to prevent his side beginning brightly with Joel Robles swiftly needing to show off his reflexes by repelling Stewart Downing\u2019s beautifully curved free kick. Shortly afterwards Everton\u2019s goalkeeper attempted to gather a corner and, with Christian Stuani blatantly barging into him, the ball hit him on the head and bounced into the back of the net. It was an easy one for the referee Roger East to disallow. Suitably spurred, Mart\u00ednez\u2019s players responded with a legitimate goal. On Monday Karanka had enthused about the time he spent coaching the teenage Deulofeu in Spain\u2019s junior teams and raved about the winger\u2019s talent. As if to emphasise this was no hyperbole, the man of the moment seized possession near the halfway line and proceeded to sashay beyond a couple of defenders, leaving Ben Gibson on his backside, before unleashing a low shot from the edge of the area. As it whizzed into the bottom corner with unerring accuracy, the sense of disappointment in the stands was almost palpable. Teesside optimism turned to resignation as Deulofeu provided one of the best assists likely to be seen anywhere all season. A delightful Everton passing move concluded with the game\u2019s principal talent teasing and tormenting Fernando Amorebieta with a series of dazzling, bewitching, stepovers. With the home defence thoroughly bamboozled, Deulofeu delivered a fine cross. Connecting cleanly, Lukaku expertly headed it beyond Tom\u00e1s Mej\u00edas. Undeterred, Boro fans turned their attentions to Alastair Brownlee, the popular match commentator for BBC Radio Tees recently diagnosed with bowel cancer. Having illuminated all four sides of the stadium by lighting up their mobile phones like torches they chorused: \u201cAli Brownlee, he\u2019s one of us.\u201d Down on the pitch, Grant Leadbitter and Adam Clayton were finding the going tough in central midfield but, like their team-mates creditably refused to give up. It was not so much that Boro were playing badly just that Everton at times seemed to be belong in a different stratosphere. Much of the visitors\u2019 passing, movement and ball retention was breathtaking while in the goalscorers Karanka\u2019s normally assured defence found themselves confronted by irrepressible opponents. Attempting to limit the potential damage, Boro\u2019s manager replaced Carlos de Pena with the more defensively minded Adam Forshaw. Sure enough this switch seemed to galvanise the hosts and Robles did well to keep Downing\u2019s crisply struck left-foot shot out. Stuani might have subsequently pulled a goal back but headed wastefully over. By then Everton had survived a handball penalty appeal against Ramiro Funes Mori and, perhaps relaxing a little, were experiencing some slapdash moments. They refocused once Leighton Baines made his long awaited return from injury. Minutes into his first appearance of the season the left-back was booked for lecturing the referee, Dani Ayala having been lucky to escape serious sanction for apparently elbowing Deulofeu. \u201cAn unfortunate incident,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez, diplomatically. \u201cEverton are an amazing team with an amazing manager,\u201d said Karanka. \u201cAll we can do is congratulate them. They had to play at 100% to beat us but it was very difficult to stop Deulofeu.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
