Powerleague said yesterday it is to float on the Alternative Investment Market to raise \u00a328m - half from the sale of shares owned by chairman Mr Littner and Powerleague's other directors and half from new shares. The proceeds will be used to repay bank debt and to finance the company's continued expansion. Powerleague will be capitalised at \u00a340m. The company, whose main sponsor is Xbox, operates 26 five-a-side centres used by 70,000 players each week. The sport is growing in popularity and the number of adults playing it has risen by a third in the past two years to six million. The company was founded in 1999 and has expanded rapidly. Last year it made profit of \u00a32.4m on revenues of \u00a315.3m. It is considering the acquisition of sites in Germany and Holland, identified as potential growth areas. Mr Littner and the other directors - chief executive Sean Tracey, pictured with two of the teams, finance director Sheena Beckwith and operations director Jeremy Hall - hold about 80% of the company's capital, a figure that will fall to 50% after the placing. Software services provider Hamsard also said yesterday it would seek a listing on Aim next month to raise \u00a33m for business development and to bolster its working capital. The company expects to be capitalised at \u00a318m. Set up in 2002, Hamsard specialises in the provision of network security solutions and business intelligence applications for clients including Barclays Capital, Bear Stearns and JP Morgan. Separately, Tradal, the company behind online gambling site Empire Poker, is said to be in talks with stockbroker Numis Securities over a possible \u00a3500m flotation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
