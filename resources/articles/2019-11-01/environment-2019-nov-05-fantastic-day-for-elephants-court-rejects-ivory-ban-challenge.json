Conservation groups, who argued that any dilution of the ban would revitalise illegal elephant poaching, welcomed the decision, which they said would preserve the UK\u2019s position as a world leader in the fight against the ivory trade. Last month, a small number of antique dealers challenged the ban in the high court, arguing that sales of \u201ccultural heritage\u201d objects had no impact on the market for illegally plundered tusks. The 2018 Ivory Act, which attracted cross-party support, has yet to come into force. It criminalises trade in all ivory artefacts with a few artistic exemptions. The prohibition was championed by the former environment secretary Michael Gove, who pledged to introduce \u201cone of the world\u2019s toughest bans on ivory sales to protect elephants for future generations\u201d. The high court claim was brought in the name of a newly formed company, Friends of Antique Cultural Treasures (Fact), but funds were channelled via the British Antique Dealers\u2019 Association (Bada). The dealers also said the ban undermined the European convention on human rights by interfering with individuals\u2019 property rights. Responding to the judgment, Mary Rice, the chief executive of the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), said: \u201cThis is a victory for common sense and one which maintains the UK\u2019s position as a global leader when it comes to fighting the illegal ivory trade.\u201d The EIA is part of a coalition of 11 conservation organisations that supported the Ivory Act, arguing that any legal trade in ivory provides cover for the illegal trade because it is difficult to distinguish between antique and newly carved ivory. The UK is one of the world\u2019s leading exporters of antique ivory, particularly to China and Hong Kong. The environment secretary, Theresa Villiers, said: \u201cI welcome today\u2019s ruling by the high court which upholds the UK\u2019s commitment to ban the ivory trade. \u201cWe will move forward and make sure the ban comes into operation as soon as possible to protect wildlife and the environment.\u201d The European commission is considering further restrictions on ivory trade across the EU, based in part on the UK\u2019s Ivory Act. Other countries, such as Singapore, Australia and New Zealand, have introduced, or are considering, similar legislation. John Stephenson, the chief executive of the campaign group Stop Ivory, said: \u201cChallenges to the new legislation fly in the face of British public opinion, which increasingly puts the conservation of nature before profit. We hope that\u2019s the end of the matter and that the government can get on with implementing the act, without further distractions.\u201d Conservationists estimate that 55 African elephants are poached every day, which they say is an unsustainable rate of loss. David Cowdrey, the head of policy and campaigns at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said: \u201cWe are delighted to hear that the high court has rejected the antiques lobby\u2019s bid to overturn the Ivory Act. It is a fantastic day for elephants, and for everyone that has fought so hard to make the UK\u2019s ivory ban one of the toughest in the world.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
