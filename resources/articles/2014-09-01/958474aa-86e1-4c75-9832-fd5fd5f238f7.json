It may well be a struggle for the 41\u2011year\u2011old to take part in a \u201chome\u201d meeting with the United States again and in four years the event will take place in France. Do not dare, though, suggest to Westwood that three days at Gleneagles next weekend will take on extra importance for those very reasons. The fact he will participate for Europe as a captain\u2019s pick would, ordinarily, only add to Westwood\u2019s determination to succeed. \u201cI won\u2019t appreciate it any more, because I\u2019ve always appreciated playing in the Ryder Cup,\u201d Westwood says. \u201cIt\u2019s a privileged experience to go through. And the more you play in them, the more you take it all in and enjoy it more. \u201cThe first couple of times you play it all goes past you in a blur. It all happens so fast you don\u2019t really recognise everything that\u2019s happening. But when it gets to six, seven, eight you can slow down and take it all in.\u201d This will mark Westwood\u2019s ninth appearance as a member of team Europe. His first came way back in 1997, when the USA were defeated by a point at Valderrama. \u201cThere\u2019s been hundreds of great memories from the Ryder Cup and very few bad ones,\u201d Westwood added. \u201cThat first day, 1st tee, you still get really nervous. Not quite as bad as Valderrama. That was struggling to get the ball on the tee kind of thing. But I looked across and I saw Brad Faxon\u2019s hand shaking as well, so that made me feel better.\u201d It seems inconceivable that the Englishman will not be a Ryder Cup captain in the not-so-distant future, an ambition he has been perfectly open about in the past. The man in current charge of Europe, Paul McGinley, has a clear ally in Westwood. More than that, the former world No1 has backed the decision of McGinley to employ five vice-captains, a move that has been described as over the top by some onlookers, most notably Ian Woosnam, Europe\u2019s 2006 winning captain. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal has been brought back into the fold after his successful captaincy in 2012, with Miguel \u00c1ngel Jim\u00e9nez adding to the Spanish flavour of McGinley\u2019s backroom team. Padraig Harrington, Sam Torrance and Des Smyth are also involved. \u201cI\u2019ve been very impressed,\u201d Westwood says of McGinley. \u201cPaul kept me informed all the way through [the qualification process]. He let me know where I stood without lumping any pressure on me. \u201cHe has a good backroom team. One of the things which let Nick [Faldo, in 2008] down was that he didn\u2019t have enough vice-captains. I like to see someone with each match so they can relay back to the captain and let the captain know what form people are in so he can judge his picks for the afternoon or the next day. He has more of an idea of how people are doing. \u201cOver the last few years it has been quite a British-dominated side so it\u2019s important to have British and Irish vice-captains. But it\u2019s also important to have European ones because sometimes the Europeans feel a bit alienated from that and you don\u2019t want that \u2013 you want the team talking together. \u201cIt\u2019s great that he\u2019s got Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal and Jim\u00e9nez as well as Des and players who have played recently. It\u2019s nice that he\u2019s got a couple of past captains in there whose opinion he obviously respects. The buck stops with Paul but he will have all the right information from people who have been through it. Myself and Paul have grown up playing on the European Tour together. He will know most players\u2019 personalities pretty well so that has got to be an advantage.\u201d Westwood has previous for guiding rookie players, namely Nicolas Colsaerts and Martin Kaymer, through the opening stages of the Ryder Cup. He is likely to adopt such a role again, with speculation already linking Westwood to a partnership with Jamie Donaldson. The pair played together over the opening 36 holes of this week\u2019s Wales Open. \u201cWe\u2019ve discussed lots of pairings, ones that are very different,\u201d Westwood says. \u201cHopefully I will be a mentor to some of the new guys. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried to do over the last few. I think that\u2019s what the experienced players have to do. It\u2019s a tough thing to be thrown in that first day. If you do go through that it\u2019s good to have an experienced player there. It definitely helps you.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
