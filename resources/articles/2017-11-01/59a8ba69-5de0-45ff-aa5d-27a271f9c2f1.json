Berganza had been suspended after an extensive report into the allegations was published last Friday by BuzzFeed. One of the women, Liz Gehrlein Marsham, claimed that Berganza, a top editor at DC Comics who oversaw properties including Superman and Wonder Woman, forcibly kissed her at a bar in December 2006, when she had worked for the company for less than three weeks. Later that evening, she alleged, he tried to grope her. Joan Hilty, another editor at DC, alleged that Berganza \u201cgrabbed her and repeatedly tried to pull her in for a kiss\u201d in the early 2000s, reported BuzzFeed. In a 2014 article about sexism in the comics industry, Hilty wrote in the Guardian of \u201cthe drunk superior at an offsite office party who locked his arm around my shoulders, trying to pull me towards him for a kiss\u201d. BuzzFeed\u2019s article suggests that Berganza was the unnamed superior. The complaints were reportedly shared with the company\u2019s human resources department closer to the time they happened. On Monday, the company issued a statement to the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cWarner Bros and DC Entertainment have terminated the employment of DC Comics Group Editor Eddie Berganza,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are committed to eradicating harassment and ensuring that all employees, as well as our freelance community, are aware of our policies, are comfortable reporting any concerns and feel supported by our Company.\u201d In 2010, the former DC editor Janelle Asselin organized a group of employees to report a joint complaint to HR about Berganza, who continued to rise through the ranks and was named executive editor later that year. Asselin said that development was \u201cmassively demoralising\u201d at the time. She told BuzzFeed that all the women she knew who were involved in the complaint eventually left DC. Berganza was demoted two years later after allegations that he was involved in another incident, forcibly kissing a woman at the WonderCon entertainment convention. The woman herself later said she was too scared to report the coercion, but allegations surfaced in a Bleeding Cool article, which initially did not name Berganza. Berganza had worked with DC since the early 1990s. After the earlier suspension of Berganza, the comics website the Mary Sue alleged that DC\u2019s response was \u201cundeniably too little, too late\u201d. The Guardian has not yet been able to reach Berganza for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
