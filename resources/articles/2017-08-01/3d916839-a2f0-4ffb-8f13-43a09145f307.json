Five years on, during the final day of the world championships, he watched as his team gorged on the juicy flesh on offer \u2013 and, in doing so, perhaps saved his job. Two more medals on Sunday \u2013 a silver in the women\u2019s 4x400m and a bronze in the men\u2019s 4x400m \u2013 meant that Britain completed a sweep of relay honours and took their final tally in these championships to six. Incredibly, after having just one medal during the first eight days, British athletes went on to claim another five in a stretch from 8.35pm on Saturday to 9.20pm \u2013 which must count as one of the most successful 24-hour periods in its history. True, six medals is at the low end of the target of six to eight set by UK Sport. But that mark has still been hit which means Black\u2019s job is surely safe. The first British medal on Sunday came in the women\u2019s 4x400m. It had looked a weak race before the start and it became even weaker when Jamaica\u2019s Anneisha McLaughlin-Whilby pulled up on the second leg with a hamstring problem. That meant the 4x400m was no longer a battle royale between Jamaica and the United States but a procession. With Allyson Felix, who ran a staggering 48.7sec leg, driving the US team home they cantered to gold in 3.19:02. Almost six seconds behind came Great Britain\u2019s team of Zoey Clark, Laviai Nielsen, Eilidh Doyle and Emily Diamond, who took silver in 3:25.00, with Poland third in 3:25.41. Nielsen paid tribute to the home support afterwards. \u201cThe crowd was even louder than they were on Saturday and I didn\u2019t even think that was possible,\u201d the 21-year-old Londoner said. \u201cThe team is so close so to come out and win a medal is beyond words. I can\u2019t even begin to describe how amazing this feels.\u201d Now it was up to Britain\u2019s relay men. Their team had been struggling all season but the elimination of Botswana, the Olympic silver medallists Jamaica and London 2012 champions Bahamas had given them a chance of an unlikely bronze. And they took it. Matthew Hudson-Smith, who had missed the semi-finals, put Britain in second place behind the Americans. And while Dwayne Cowan slipped back to third, he established a 15-metre lead over the rest of the pack \u2013 allowing Rabah Yousif and then Martyn Rooney to bring home a medal behind Trinidad and Tobago, who took gold, and the US. Rooney, the twice European 400m champion, has had a poor season by his standards, having not broken 46 seconds all year. But in the relay he becomes a different animal. And while Rooney was happy with a medal, he believed that if he was in better shape he might have even turned bronze into gold. \u201cI have never been set up like that before,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cEven when we won a medal in Beijing it was a lot tighter and there was a lot more work to do. I wish I was in the shape I was in last year because I think I could\u2019ve gone past those guys down the home straight. \u201cIt is still amazing to come away with a medal at our home world championships,\u201d he added. \u201cI am really proud to be part of this team. There are some big men on this team who really stood up out there. We all came together to discuss everything, we sorted it all out and the result is a medal which is incredible.\u201d Meanwhile, the British Athletics chief executive, Niels de Vos, also sounded an upbeat note about the performance of the Great Britain team, who had previously come in for criticism for their lack of medals in individual events. \u201cWe are extraordinarily happy,\u201d De Vos said. \u201cWe will have had more finalists than we have ever had before, that\u2019s a fantastic result. \u201cWe had four fourths on the track that collectively were less than two-tenths of a second away from being four medals. They weren\u2019t medals, but this is a team in transition and coming out having our most finalists ever as we push towards the next Olympiad is a great place for British athletics to be in.\u201d Fresh from her relay success, team captain Eilidh Doyle also insisted that the team had made great progress over the past 10 days at these world championships. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to look at the bigger picture,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made the target but we\u2019ve also had some really excellent results. I urge people to look at how many people finished higher than where they were ranked coming into this \u2013 our team as a whole has performed really, really well. I\u2019m super proud of this team, they\u2019ve done a really good job.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
