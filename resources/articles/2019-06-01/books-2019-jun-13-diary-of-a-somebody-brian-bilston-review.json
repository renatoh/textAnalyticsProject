Having made his name as \u201cthe poet laureate of Twitter\u201d \u2013 a dubious honorific \u2013 he published an excellent debut collection in 2016, You Took The Last Bus Home, which showcased his puckish wit, typographical twists and genius for wordplay. In \u201cRobert Frost\u2019s Netflix Choice\u201d, he poses the question: An action thriller with Liam Neeson or a post-apocalyptic world forsaken? Decides upon The Road not Taken Imagine a mash-up of John Cooper Clarke, Ed Reardon\u2019s Week and James Joyce, and you\u2019re about halfway there. One also detects in Bilston\u2019s love of the banal a knowing touch of Mr Pooter, which may be why he calls his first novel Diary of a Somebody. It focuses on Brian, a 45-year-old sad sack with a yen for light verse and custard creams, who has decided he must change his life. His ex-wife Sophie has fallen for a new man, a motivational speaker and life coach. His son Dylan has twigged that Brian is possibly depressed and in need of help (\u201che made reference to my sobbing and the repeated banging of my head on the table\u201d). At work, burdened by spreadsheets and corporate speak, he feels his self-esteem thinning by the day: \u201cI spend my time multi-slacking \u2026 slowly fading into jobsolescence.\u201d Only in poetry does he find refuge and relief, interlarding diary entries with his mischievous verses, some parodies of pop songs (REM, Bee Gees, Blur), some of actual poems, nearly all of them quotable. I especially like his haiku horoscopes: Capricorn: Trousers start to sag as your pockets bulge with coins A year of much change At his monthly poetry club he has developed a crush on fellow cat-lover Liz and a pointed dislike of Toby Salt, a bumptious litterateur whose first collection, This Bridge No Hands Shall Cleave, has proved an unfathomable success. So when Salt mysteriously vanishes, Brian comes under suspicion, not least from Mrs McNulty, his spiritualist neighbour and fan of Countdown (\u201cShe claims that amidst the vowels and consonants there are hidden messages from \u2018the other side\u2019. I don\u2019t know whether she means BBC Two or Channel 5\u201d). And what exactly has Brian been up to in his new writer\u2019s shed, apart from the usual business of not writing? Bilston was first published by the crowdfunded imprint Unbound, then taken up by Picador. He has done them proud. Diary of a Somebody is packed with droll puns, whimsical riffs and deft parodies, some of which I was pleased to spot before I realised (deflatingly) that they are all attributed in a list at the end. And yet I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an outstanding book, let alone, as the publisher\u2019s blurb claims, \u201cthe most original novel you will read this or any year\u201d. Does it even mean to be? Bilston is a magician with words, but he\u2019s no storyteller; the plot is on the level of a sitcom, as are its characters. A great comic novel is distinguished by something above and beyond the honourable aim to tweak the funny bone; consider, for instance, the bravura inventiveness and energy of Martin Amis\u2019s Money. It may reach beyond its setting to encapsulate an era, like Jonathan Coe\u2019s What a Carve Up! or Kingsley Amis\u2019s Lucky Jim; or it may be lit up by a character of memorable monstrousness (Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s Angel Deverell in Angel, Philip Roth\u2019s Mickey Sabbath in Sabbath\u2019s Theater \u2026 name your favourite). Or it may be a novel that starts out as comic before turning altogether darker, such as JG Farrell\u2019s Troubles. Diary of a Somebody keeps up a stream of witticisms that is admirable and relentless and, in the end, a little bit tiresome. It has no variation in tone or pace, which over a long stretch does the comedy no favours. The repetition of Brian blowing each chance of intimacy with Liz, for example, becomes a sort of purgatory. Bilston\u2019s book of poems, on the other hand, allows the reader to dip in at will; like Brian\u2019s beloved custard creams, they are best consumed in twos or threes, rather than upending the whole packet at once. So maybe you should also read this novel in short bursts, pausing to savour its individual brilliancies, such as this tweet on Star Wars Day: \u201cHer name was Yoda / A show girl she was.\u201d I laughed just typing that out. \u2022 Anthony Quinn\u2019s Our Friends in Berlin is published by Cape.
