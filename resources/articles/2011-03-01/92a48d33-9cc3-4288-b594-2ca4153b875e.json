Two enormous screens in the gallery each show a film: one is a performance of the K364 in Warsaw, and the other depicts the two Jewish soloists, Avri Levitan and Roi Shiloah, travelling to Poland from Berlin by train for the concert. I suspect you're meant to watch the train film first, though on my visit it was difficult to tell: the projectors had broken down, and when they fixed them, the live concert came up first. It's a nice performance, and it's wonderful to see the viola player really caressing every note. But the camera- work was very irritating. It's all in extreme close-up, so you learn as much about the musicians' shaving habits as their musical personalities. The effect feels agitated and crowded, which clashes with the music: the K364 is one of Mozart's most perfect pieces, and Mozart is always about balance and elegance as well as emotion. As for the other film, I was left with no idea what Gordon's message was. There were some lovely shots of the two musicians performing on the train, as beech trees rushed past outside the windows. That did make you think of the view people would have had as they rolled towards the concentration camps. But if Gordon is intending to make any wider point about music and the Holocaust, it's vague and indistinct. We already know many eloquent stories about Jewish musicians in the camps. If an artist tackles a subject like the Holocaust, it's dangerous not to come up to snuff: the art can feel like a cliche and lose its emotional impact. Gordon needs to raise his game. Mozart would have been up to it \u2013 or he would have known that he wasn't. \u2022 Paul Silverthorne is principal viola with the London Symphony Orchestra. Douglas Gordon's k.364 is at the Gagosian Gallery, London WC1 (020-7841 996), until 26 March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
