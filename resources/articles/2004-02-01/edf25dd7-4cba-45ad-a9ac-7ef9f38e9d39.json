The work and pensions secretary, Andrew Smith, spelt out details of the new system to MPs claiming it would be a \"fair\" measure of poverty when it is introduced after 2005. He said \"absolute poverty\" for a single child would be defined as living in a household with an income of \u00a3210 a week or less at today's prices. \"Relative or low income\" will be set at 60% of the median average household income while \"material deprivation\" will be 70%, if families are also unable to afford particular essential goods and services. Poverty will be accepted to be falling if all three measures are heading in the right direction, he explained. The present system relies on a snapshot of 15 indicators including low income, health inequality and housing quality. Speaking at the work and pensions select committee inquiry into child poverty, Mr Smith said: \"The measurements we have selected will give a fair measure of progress.\" But the new system was criticised by charities, leaders of the Church of England and the End Child Poverty Campaign. The campaign director, Jonathan Stearn, said the changes will affect more than 1 million children and urged the government to include housing costs in its poverty calculations. He said: \"The government has made an historic and admirable commitment to end child poverty within a generation. But it needs to meet that commitment by truly removing children from poverty, not just removing them from the statistics.\" He added that housing costs are higher in the UK and ignoring them meant the government would be ignoring a major cause of child poverty. Earlier a coalition of 66 non-government agencies, including the Church of England synod and the children's charity Barnardo's, called on the government to set up an independent minimum standards commission to decide what information should be used when measuring poverty. The Zacchaeus 2000 coalition wants the cost of essential goods and services needed to maintain a healthy life to influence where the poverty line is drawn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
