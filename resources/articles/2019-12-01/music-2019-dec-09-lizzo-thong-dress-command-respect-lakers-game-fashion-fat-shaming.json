With this in mind you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that the disdain for Lizzo, who on Sunday night wore an ass-less dress and a thong to a Lakers game, is nothing more than the standard fare reserved for scantily-clad women. It is not. After videos of the Juice musician\u2019s outfit went viral last night, people paid their respects on Twitter: it seems multiple children had their innocence stolen at the game. Lizzo, dancing happily on the Jumbotron mm-hming at Karl Towns, apparently did not realize she was at a family game. While the language of the outrage focuses on moral decency, the Rikishi jokes, the photos circulating comparing Lizzo to Jabba the Hutt, the countless memes of grimacing children and the \u201cjust why\u201d commentary all seem to be asking another question: does she not realize how fat she is? Lizzo does realize; she just doesn\u2019t see being fat as an insult. \u201cWhen I\u2019m looking at my body and I\u2019m shaming every little thing about it\u2026 I have to find love in those things. And I think that is why I\u2019m able to call myself fat,\u201d she said in an interview with CBS this year. Some argue that this is nothing to do with Lizzo\u2019s size: an ill-advised outfit is ill-advised on anyone, fat or not. Those people would be well advised to consider that when Nicki Minaj wore a bondage outfit to a Lakers game in 2018, people barely bat an eyelid. Nor was the same disdain afforded to Rhianna after she attended a Raptors game in a see-through shirt and no bra. If RiRi pushes fashion to its limits, after all, it\u2019s a statement to be celebrated. But when Lizzo dares to push the envelope, the discourse takes a whole different slant infused with fat-shaming. And when the cheerleaders do it? Oh, that\u2019s just sport."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
