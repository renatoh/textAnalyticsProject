For instance, where would you put Eraserhead? Is it science fiction, horror or comedy? It's all and none of those. Better to put it with all the other David Lynch films, and now \u2013 thanks to this impressive Blu-ray box set \u2013 you can. Where some great films have been a missed opportunity when transferred to HD, the Lynch collection does the job properly. The picket fences in Blue Velvet have never looked so perfect; Eraserhead takes you much further into its harrowing nightmare world; the flames that burn through Wild At Heart seem more dangerous and vibrant. Those Lynch films that are, often unfairly, held in lower regard are ripened for reappraisal: the wonderful Dune has some of his strangest and most imaginative moments, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me stands as a deep, dark and cryptic film experience, while Lost Highway is, believe it or not, even creepier. The improved sound of Blu-ray gives an extra kick to the inventive, immersive soundscapes, mostly by the late, great Lynch collaborator Alan Splet. Extras also deliver, with all of Lynch's short films, plenty of deleted scenes and interviews and a slew of tests and oddities such as his brutally funny cartoon series Dumbland. No matter how many times you've seen Lynch's productions, you've never seen them as well presented as they are here. Blu-ray, Universal Pictures Red Dog The titular mutt steals the show and the hearts of the audience in this moving, humorous Aussie true story. Blu-ray &amp; DVD, G2 Pictures The Return Of The Living Dead Classic, hysterical horror comedy with more than five hours of labour-of-love extras. Blu-ray &amp; DVD, Second Sight Yellow Submarine Spectacularly psychedelic Beatles pop art animated classic. Blu-ray &amp; DVD, EMI Juan Of The Dead A great week for zomedies!
