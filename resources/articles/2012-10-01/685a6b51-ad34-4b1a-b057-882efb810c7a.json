The 39-year-old, who retired from football two years ago following a short spell with Crystal Palace, will share the management role with Mark Robson, who has been head coach at Underhill since the start of the season. \"Dutch legend, former Barcelona, Juventus, Ajax &amp; Milan midfielder Edgar Davids joins Barnet &amp; becomes joint Head Coach with Mark Robson,\" read a tweet on Thursday night from the club's official Twitter feed. Robson added on the club's website: \"I am delighted to welcome Edgar to our club. His experience as a player throughout his illustrious career will be a massive benefit to all our players and I look forward to forming a strong partnership with him.\" On his own Twitter site, Davids wrote: \"Happy to say I will join my local football club Barnet fc as a player/coach.\" Barnet are currently bottom of League Two having failed to win any matches in any competition this season and thus it is not a surprise that they have made a change to their management structure. Tony Kleanthous, Barnet's chairman, said: \"I am absolutely delighted to welcome Edgar as part of our exciting set up at Barnet FC. We have world class training facilities that are now attracting world class players and I feel, despite recent results, that these are exciting times ahead for our club.\" Eyebrows will be raised, however, at the appointment of Davids, who has no previous coaching experience having, since retirement, only worked in a boardroom capacity at Ajax, the club where the Dutchman made his name and won the Champions League in 1995. Davids, who has also played for Internazionale and Tottenham, could be in the Underhill dugout for Saturday's visit of Plymouth and on the pitch over the next few weeks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
