But it was Bath, the festival on the doorstep of the composer's Wiltshire home, that got in first, with two days of concerts concentrating on his smaller-scale and less heard instrumental and choral works and arrangements. It all began in the Bath Guildhall with only the second UK performance of one of Birtwistle's most spectacular pieces from the 1970s, the \"ceremony\" for six percussionists, For O, For O, the Hobby-horse is Forgot. The title comes from Hamlet, and the work was composed after Birtwistle had been working on a production of the play at the National Theatre in 1976. It's a compelling mix of musical performance and dumbshow led by two players identified as the King and Queen, in which stylised gestures are as important as the rhythmic complexities obtained from an array of unpitched instruments. Ensemble Bash played it with a fierce mix of discipline and intensity that drew the audience into a ritual whose rules seem to be privileged information - \"like Americans watching cricket\" was Birtwistle's analogy. A selection of Birtwistle's arrangements played by the Bath Spa University New Music Ensemble under Charles Wiffen provided a modest contrast. But a late-night concert in the inspired surroundings of the Museum of Bath at Work returned to Birtwistle's fascination with pulse, with a playback of his only self-standing electronic work. Chronometer, from 1971, uses the sound of the mechanisms of Big Ben and the Wells Cathedral clock to create a meditation on the passing of time and mortality; it never resorts to the cliches of electronic music, but creates a sound world that's instantly identifiable as Birtwistle's own. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 June 2009. The original misnamed a group as the University of Bath New Music Ensemble. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
