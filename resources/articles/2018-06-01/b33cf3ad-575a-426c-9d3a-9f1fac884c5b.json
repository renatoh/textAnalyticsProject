Dunlop lays down the law in regard to this rare interview and all other personal interaction because from Saturday, and during six days of deadly racing, he will reach speeds in excess of 200mph as he pushes his motorbike to the limit on ordinary roads and mountain passes that have taken the lives of 256 riders over the years. Dunlop is one of the most intriguing yet prickliest men in sport. He has won 15 TT races and will surely go on to break the record held by his uncle Joey, the greatest road racer in history, who won 26 times on the Isle of Man before being killed on his bike in 2000. Dunlop also lost his father, Robert, Joey\u2019s brother, at the North West 200 in their native Northern Ireland in 2008. Since we did this interview, Dan Kneen, who rode alongside Dunlop for Tyco BMW, died on Wednesday evening in practice for the TT. Stressing that he is \u201cas fired up as I\u2019ve ever been\u201d, the 29-year-old does not dismiss a question as to whether he may shatter another TT record by winning six races at this year\u2019s meeting. \u201cAnything is possible,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019ll have to ride my bike as hard as I can. If that\u2019s good enough to win, then great. If it\u2019s not, that\u2019s the way life is. These are long races and a lot goes on. We\u2019ll take each one as it comes and see where we end up.\u201d I have learned that with Dunlop it is wise to approach each encounter with few expectations that his brusque manner will soften and open a few chinks in the wall he has built around himself. We met for the first time last month, in the Triangle, as the North West 200 course is known, linking Portstewart, Coleraine and Portrush. Ten years and one day had passed since his dad died on those very roads and Dunlop said a wary hello. It had been made clear he was not giving any interviews and I did not press him. Instead we spoke briefly about his 2017 book, Road Racer, which provides a compelling account of his dad\u2019s death. On 15 May 2008 Robert and his two sons, William and Michael, were practising at the North West when the red flags came out. Eventually Michael saw \u201ca man lying next to what\u2019s left of his bike. That\u2019s when it hits me. The man lying next to the broken bike is my dad\u201d. Two days later, and defying the race stewards who declared that neither he nor his brother were fit to race, Michael got back on his bike. He wanted to honour his father by racing. The stewards were made to back down by a 19-year-old. Now, on the Isle of Man, Dunlop remembers how he only felt peace when snapping down his visor. Above the roaring engines, a sound that defined his father\u2019s life, Dunlop heard silence. He looks at me for the first time since our interview began 15 minutes earlier: \u201cOnce you\u2019re on the bike you\u2019ve got freedom. It\u2019s only you. Off the bike lots of people are picking and poking at you. I\u2019m free on the bike.\u201d In 2008 the teenage Dunlop raced wheel-to-wheel against Christian Elkin and the great John McGuinness. It was a dramatic race with, as Dunlop suggests in his book, \u201cno love given, no love lost \u2026 I\u2019m going so fast I don\u2019t know if I can stop\u201d. Dunlop won and the crowd erupted \u2013 in memory of Robert and in amazement at the grit of his son. For Dunlop: \u201cMy head\u2019s full of tears. I\u2019ve won the race but I can\u2019t find any happiness in it. Tomorrow, I bury my father.\u201d He has done so much since then. When Dunlop won the Senior TT last year he moved up to fourth among the all-time winners while strengthening his reputation as the world\u2019s best road racer and the sport\u2019s most difficult man. He loathes interviews and the only person able to persuade him to talk to me is Paul Phillips, who runs the TT, the race meeting that means most to Dunlop. Our conversation is stilted until I ask if his enjoyment of racing has diminished. \u201cI like the winning. It\u2019s just this crap [Dunlop points at my recorder]. I don\u2019t like doing this. I ride a motorbike to race. You write stories to sell newspapers. But the newspapers don\u2019t sponsor me. I\u2019m doing this for free when I could be working on my bikes. \u201cPeople say you need newspapers to create sponsorship. But the newspapers only want to speak to you when you\u2019re winning. I don\u2019t do much press now because I don\u2019t like the bullshit.\u201d Dunlop\u2019s stark honesty is bracing. I hope I am not \u201cpushing and poking\u201d him too hard? He shrugs. \u201cEverybody does \u2013 in one way or the other.\u201d He only really begins to engage when I mention the 2015 TT. Two days before he was due to race his Yamaha he swapped it for a BMW. It is as bizarre as Lewis Hamilton stepping away from his Mercedes before a race and climbing inside a Ferrari. Surely this caused huge flak? \u201cI don\u2019t believe in flak. I don\u2019t do flak. I do my own thing and if people don\u2019t like it that\u2019s their problem. I\u2019m not a monkey at a circus. I\u2019m not here to entertain anyone. I\u2019m just here to win.\u201d It still seems incredible he could hop on to a rival bike despite contracts and lawyers. \u201cThere\u2019s a real story there,\u201d he concedes. \u201cBut we\u2019ll save that for another book. It\u2019s not about who wears the right T-shirt or who shocked who. It\u2019s about winning.\u201d He is on a variety of bikes at this year\u2019s TT, refusing to be tied to one manufacturer while running his own team, Michael Dunlop Racing. Apart from showing his voracious ambition it underlines Dunlop\u2019s intelligence, despite his limited education, in securing the best bikes. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the best bikes,\u201d he insists. \u201cAll the manufacturers\u2019 bikes are pretty equal. It\u2019s about finding the best people I can do business with.\u201d Dunlop acknowledges the gravity of road racing in his book: \u201cDeath is responsible for the man I am today \u2013 my dad going, my winning that race the day before his funeral, continuing the Dunlop \u2018dynasty\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019d give it all up tomorrow to have him back just for a day.\u201d He winces. \u201cIt was a stupid thing to say because anybody who lost their father would feel that. It\u2019s the same for any normal human being.\u201d His uncle Joey is feted justifiably but Dunlop believes his father was often as good on the bike and sometimes even better. \u201cOh yeah. He obviously had a shorter career but he was real good. He had two life-changing injuries so he had to keep motivating himself to get better. He was such a strong person and one of the toughest men who ever rode.\u201d Robert Dunlop crashed so badly during practice for the TT in May 1994 that he spent six months in hospital and was bed-ridden for a year. His son, however, says: \u201cI don\u2019t take fear into consideration. Fear stays with you for ever. So I don\u2019t do fear. Yeah, I\u2019ve been scared on a bike but you don\u2019t dwell on it. The important thing is to keep pushing.\u201d When last did he feel scared on his bike? \u201cNot so long ago \u2026 but long enough not to remember it.\u201d His closest rival, Ian Hutchinson, one ahead of Dunlop on the all-time list and winner of a record five TT victories in a week, suffered another horrendous crash in the Senior race last year. Hutchinson could not walk for 11 months but he returned to racing two weeks ago at the North West. He shuffled over on a stick and gave me a gripping interview. Does Dunlop admire Hutchinson\u2019s courage in making it to the TT? \u201cEveryone who races motorbikes does their own thing. I don\u2019t look out for anyone else. They don\u2019t look out for me.\u201d Does he really dislike Hutchinson? \u201cThat\u2019s not the point. I just race motorbikes.\u201d Dunlop is more relaxed when he tells me about the veterinary practice he part-owns in Dublin. \u201cThe lady that runs it is fantastic. I try to go as often as I can but I let her get on with it. She doesn\u2019t need me asking stupid questions. For me it wasn\u2019t just a business decision. It was also wanting to do something different.\u201d It is a shame that a racer as gifted as Dunlop cannot enjoy his success more in public. He often seems suspicious and contemptuous. Is that a true reflection of how he feels? \u201cI\u2019ve met good people in this game, 90% are really good. But the other 10% ruin it for the 90%. I\u2019m happy working hard with those good people, like my mechanics. I push them to the maximum because I want to get the best out of it. \u201cIt\u2019s not because I\u2019m a wanker. I live alone so I\u2019m fortunate I\u2019m my own free man. My mum\u2019s always very good. She never asks any questions. She\u2019s had her troubles, like everyone, but she keeps going and pushing \u2013 like I do.\u201d I can sense how hard Dunlop will push himself and his bike at the TT and so I thank him for giving me half an hour. He stretches out his hand and says: \u201cNo problem.\u201d Outside, lines of people try to glimpse Dunlop inside his motorhome. He may turn out to be the mightiest Dunlop of them all but he looks lost to the world. Dunlop is hunched over a bike, talking to a mechanic, absorbed in his work. He almost looks happy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
