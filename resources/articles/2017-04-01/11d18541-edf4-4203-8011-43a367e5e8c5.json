The suggestion that the US could intervene in the conflict would be a radical departure from the exclusively \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach that has hitherto defined Trump\u2019s policy. In Syria, that meant focusing exclusively on Islamic State (Isis) and other extremists, and putting off dealing with the country\u2019s political transition. \u201cI don\u2019t like Assad at all,\u2019\u2019 Trump declared in a presidential debate last October. \u201cBut Assad is killing Isis. Russia is killing Isis and Iran is killing Isis.\u201d Only a few days ago, the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, declared: \u201cour priority is no longer to sit and focus on getting Assad out\u201d. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had argued the Syrian president\u2019s future \u201cwill be decided by the Syrian people\u201d, ignoring the fact that many of those people were under relentless bombardment by Assad and unable to voice an opinion. Even more confounding was Trump\u2019s declaration that the Idlib gas attack crossed \u201cmany, many lines \u2013 beyond a red line\u201d. The comment came only hours after the president had lambasted Barack Obama for laying down the original red line on Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons in 2012 and then not attacking when the line was crossed in August 2013. Trump has consistently argued that the failure to deliver on the \u201cred line\u201d threat projected US weakness. But it was far from clear on Wednesday what action his own administration would take now that Assad had crossed \u201cmany, many lines\u201d. But there were plenty of hints that the administration was at least considering a direct \u2013 possibly military \u2013 response. Haley said that when the UN fails in its duty, \u201cthere are times in the life of states when we are compelled to take our own actions\u201d. The White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, said on Tuesday: \u201cRest assured that I think [Trump] has been speaking with his national security team this morning, and we will continue to have that discussion both internally with our national security team, as well as with our allies around the globe.\u201d The defence secretary, James Mattis, said the Idlib act was \u201ca heinous act and will be treated as such\u201d. The national security council that Trump consults will now be shorn of his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, a white nationalist who has been the main advocate of the view that the struggle to destroy \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d justified alliances with the likes of Assad and Vladimir Putin. Bannon\u2019s departure is a win for the national security adviser, HR McMaster, who rejects the use of the term \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d and its implications for analysis and policy. McMaster, an ally of Mattis, is now likely to have a much freer hand in formulating Syria policy. However, these veteran military leaders will face the same constraints as the Obama administration when it comes to considering US options. Any punitive strike would have to be backed up by consideration on what to do the day after, if Assad and Putin ignore the message. Increasing military aid to rebels would carry the same risk of falling into the hands of extremists. Nor has any policymaker on the left or right ever credibly articulated a plan for Syria should the US succeed in toppling Assad, a strategic vacuum reminiscent of the disastrous Iraq occupation. Moreover, any action against the Syrian regime would now also be against Russia. Colin Kahl, a former member of the Obama White House, noted in a tweet that it was \u201cworth remembering there are Russian advisers at nearly every relevant Assad base. Any strike means dead Russians.\u201d The Idlib attack appears to have driven the first meaningful wedge between Trump and Putin. He told the New York Times: \u201cI think it\u2019s a very sad day for Russia because they\u2019re aligned, and in this case, all information points to Syria that they did this.\u201d Meanwhile, Haley \u2013 presumably with White House approval \u2013 delivered a scathing indictment of Russia at the UN Security Council. The shift in mood is clearly another consequence of the Idlib atrocity, but it is too early to say how lasting that shift will be and whether it could lead to the US and Russia clashing in the Syrian battlefield. The depth and duration of the change is particularly hard to predict, as it appears to have been driven by Trump\u2019s immediate emotional response to the event. In his remarks in the Rose Garden, he referred repeatedly to the children and babies who had been killed. Yet the victims of the Idlib attack are far from the first Syrian children to have suffered at the hands of the Assad regime, with Russian and Iranian backing. And there has been substantial evidence of previous regime use of chemical weapons. What seems to have made the difference this time is that Trump spent some time looking at pictures of the aftermath. The attack had a \u201cbig impact\u201d on him and his \u201cattitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much\u201d. The policy implications for his change in attitude are far from clear. The president\u2019s outlook could revert to its default mode once the images fade in his mind. But it seems clear that Assad may have misjudged Trump. In November, the Syrian leader called him a \u201cnatural ally\u201d, perhaps seeing in him a ruthless strongman like Putin and himself. The reality now seems to be more complicated, emotional \u2013 and unpredictable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
