As we report, he makes some sane and important recommendations \u2013 pushing ahead to Crewe as a priority and paying closer attention to the wider network \u2013 that may go some way to meeting the reservations of the critics who wonder if this is the right high-speed rail plan. Between now and the general election next year, there is everything to play for. But there is also a danger that the need to build momentum behind this project overshadows legitimate debate about whether it is the best way to do it. Sir David brings more than his Olympic honours to HS2. He has run Network Rail, so he knows how the existing track works. And he has run English Partnerships, so he has a practical understanding of the drivers of regeneration. Both of those qualifications are on show in his report, not least in his decision to launch it in Manchester, a wise recognition of the need to counter the argument that HS2 is all about bringing business to London rather than strengthening the appeal of northern centres. His message is reinforced by his plan to put the historic rail centre of Crewe back at the heart of the network as a rebuilt transport hub, and at the same time to bring the construction of the line to the town into phase one of the project. And on phase two, he calls for a regional approach to be developed jointly, rather than leaving Leeds, Sheffield, Manchester and Liverpool to plan in isolation. At last, instead of presenting it as a sleek way of keeping up with the global competition, HS2's advocates are talking in terms of integration. Sir David also shows a welcome sensitivity to the critics. He stresses the need to do as much as possible to reduce the huge but unavoidable impact of building a new line. The expensive tunnels and other mitigation are protected, while the cut-price Euston redevelopment proposed last year is rejected on the grounds that, as prime London real estate, it will pay for itself. He will make more friends by giving up the hugely disruptive plan to link HS1 with HS2, a prospect that was blighting hundreds of north London homes. But there is one question Sir David doesn't address. It is no secret now that the first plan for HS2 was an emergency response to economic crisis, one that the Tories took on to underscore commitment to the value of public spending on the right things. Unavoidably, the Higgins proposals are in part a recognition of the weaknesses of the original. But taxpayers deserve to be confident that entrenched opposition doesn't too narrowly entrench the case in favour. He must confirm that he is confident this is the best way of doing high-speed rail."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
