His first grandson was born four days ago, and just before his beloved Hartlepool play Tranmere Rovers he has come into town to see about changing his political allegiance. The 47-year-old GMB shop steward is in the offices of Respect: The Unity Coalition in Hartlepool, trying to establish whether its candidate, John Bloom, offers an alternative to a Labour party Mr Malcolm says he can no longer vote for. Like the rest of Hartlepool, Mr Malcolm does not know when he will be going to the polls, only that he will, after Peter Mandelson, the sitting MP, was resurrected as a European commissioner. Mr Mandelson leaves behind a 14,571 majority but enough lingering resentment about New Labour to make the coming byelection one of the hardest fought and most bitter of recent years. The town is not unused to electoral shocks, having appointed the 'Pool's monkey mascot, Stuart Drummond, as mayor in 2002. \"I think there is a sense of relief [Mandelson] is going,\" says Mr Malcolm. \"He was Tony's friend put into a nice safe seat. He was never from the town. He doesn't know people in the town. He had his own interests at heart, not the local interests like the hospital closure.\" Indeed, it is the threat hanging over the University Hospital of Hartlepool, whose services are under review, that has already formed the centrepiece to a campaign that is shaping up to be determinedly local. If it's not the hospital people are talking about, it's the recent closure of four local post offices, the rise in violent crime, or the implications of plans to scrap US Navy \"ghost ships\" in the town. A few doors down, at the Liberal Democrat campaign offices, all these are priority issues for the candidate, Jody Dunn, the 35-year-old multilingual and multi-tasking barrister and mother of four charged with trying to pull off another byelection upset. Even with no date set for the poll, there is a palpable sense of urgency in the old bank building that has become the Lib Dems' HQ. Volunteers man long tables, feverishly stuffing envelopes. Away from public view, a brightly coloured poster celebrating Ms Dunn's prowess at judo has been stuck to a pillar: \"We need an MP who's a brown belt not a brown nose.\" Dramatic Party activist Ed Fordham first came to Hartlepool three days after the Brent East byelection last year, \"when the whispers were starting that Peter Mandelson would go\". He bristles at suggestions that the fact that Ms Dunn comes from the far side of Darlington could count against her. She works in the local courts, he says, and two days after selection she took a flat in the centre of Hartlepool. \"Her commitment to Hartlepool is total. She wasn't born here but 48% of the town wasn't either.\" And he thinks she can pull it off. \"Hartlepool has voted against the Labour party... there is no evidence that Hartlepool is a dominant Labour town.\" In a back room, the party's former health spokesman, Evan Harris, is more circumspect. \"This is going to be extremely difficult but it is quite clearly between the two of us. The Tories are out of it. There is no sign of the Tories and there's no sign of Ukip... For Labour it is a pride thing and it is going to be extremely close. If we win this it will be most dramatic.\" Labour knows the stakes are high. Within hours of his selection, the party's new candidate, Iain Wright, an affable 32-year-old local councillor, was out campaigning. He could not be more different from his predecessor, a point acknowledged by Mr Mandelson, who has called him a \"genuine Hartlepool person\". Born and raised in the town, Mr Wright lives in the Rift House ward he represents with his wife, Tiffiny, and their three children. Their fourth child is due in November. \"I am not complacent at all,\" he said in a brief break from canvassing. \"I'm going to make sure that I convince people that voting Labour is the only possible choice... I think Peter had done a lot for the town both as a local MP and as a minister but I'm going to focus very much on local issues because I'm a local lad.\" He greatly resents the fact that his opponents are using the hospital issue. \"They're frightening local people,\" he said. \"All my children have been born there. My son was treated for meningitis there. I'm going to make sure it isn't downgraded or moved out of town.\" His ire is directed squarely at the Lib Dems. The Tories have yet to pick a candidate, while Ukip is due to announce its choice tomorrow. Tony Rowsell, who runs a local music club, thinks Labour will hold the seat. Just. \"I think it is going to be more of a fight than they have ever had in Hartlepool,\" he said. At the offices of Respect, however, party workers are trying to persuade Derek Malcolm that nothing can be taken for granted. \"This is Hartlepool,\" activist Pauline Cassim tells him. \"We elected a monkey. Miracles do happen in this town.\" Where fortunes have changed Now a safe Labour seat, Hartlepool's political history tracks Conservative collapse. In 1959 the town elected a Tory MP and as late as 1983 the Conservatives lost by only 3,000 votes. In 1992 the party took more than a third of the vote; in 2001 just a fifth. Labour won easily with 22,506 votes - 59.1% of the total, despite speculation that Peter Mandelson might struggle. In the current byelection the Liberal Democrats - who came third in 2001 with just 15% - have positioned themselves as challengers. They need a 22% swing to take the seat from Labour, similar to their results in the recent Leicester and Birmingham byelections. Ukip did well in the European elections, but without a high-profile candidate will find it hard to compete against aggressive campaigns from Labour and the Lib Dems."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
