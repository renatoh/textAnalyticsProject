The night before he had gone 10 tough rounds with Tim Sebastian on BBC World's Hard Talk - he says he was \"ambushed\" - and must think this is a catchweight contest. As 84-year-olds in wheelchairs go, he punches heavy. Walters, ex-deputy director of the CIA, ex-US ambassador to the UN, ex-US ambassador at large, ex-US ambassador to Germany, ex-military attach\u00e9 just about everywhere, and the man alleged to have orchestrated coups in Iran in 1953, Brazil in 1964 and Chile in 1973, is the last of the cold war warriors, a rightwing American convinced he was always right. He is in London to publicise his book, The Mighty and the Meek, an occasionally engaging series of portraits of the people he rubbed shoulders with in 50 years of war and diplomacy: Roosevelt, Reagan, Bush mark one, Thatcher, and above all Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger. The others, in truth, he knew only a little, but the 70s were the apogee of his power and he knew the last two intimately. The memoir of Kissinger is the best in the book, especially his explanation of why the German-born former secretary of state spoke heavily accented English while his brother, who fled with him to the US in the 1930s, did not - \"Henry never listens to anyone else\". Walters is far too kind about his subjects - even Nixon is portrayed as a hero - but he found Kissinger's arrogance hard to take. \"He really was nearly as good as he thought he was,\" is his double-edged summing up. Walters, who joined the US army as a private in 1941 and ended up half a century later as a lieutenant-general, has a clever, incisive turn of phrase, a rasping voice and what might be called a clear-eyed world view - America is great; the world should be grateful. He has no qualms about US intervention in Afghanistan, or anywhere else. \"I don't want America to be a global policeman,\" he says, \"but I don't want to live in a world where there are no police either. That's the advantage of the UN. We didn't go off and do it by ourselves. To the surprise of the Europeans, we did not react like angry children. We consulted with our allies, we talked to everybody else, then we did something, and we did it to a very strict plan.\" Does he understand the fear of American power? \"Yes, I understand it all over the world,\" he says. \"It's the same fear that there was of British power in the 19th century. Britain from Waterloo to the outbreak of the second world war had exactly the same kind of power.\" Walters, whose parents were English and who received a Jesuit education at Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, has spent almost his whole life doing something. He never married - \"I was in love with two women but they married somebody else\" - so wedded himself to winning in war and peace. His fluency in half a dozen languages - he spent his early life in Paris and could speak four languages by the age of 12 - made him invaluable as aide, interpreter and diplomat, easing his rapid rise within Nato and then the CIA. In 1953, he was in Iran when the US came to the defence of the Shah, who had been overthrown. He accepts that the CIA bankrolled a counter-coup, but denies personal involvement. Zelig-like, he was also in Brazil in 1964, where, the story goes, he was instrumental in the overthrow of the government. \"That's very flattering,\" he says, \"but as I said to the Brazilian press, would you kindly tell me what advice an American colonel with no experience in coups could give to Brazilian generals who had overthrown two presidents in the past five years? I might teach them a lot about serious war, but in overthrowing presidents I had absolutely zero experience.\" From Brazil, he moved to Paris as military attach\u00e9, but insisted on going to Vietnam first. \"I said if I go to Paris from the cocktail parties of Rio while the whole American army is involved in Vietnam I'll be a laughing stock.\" He flew 139 missions in helicopters; then he went to Paris. Walters was not so much hawkish on Vietnam as raptorish. \"I thought we should win the war by landing two divisions at Hy-Phong, going to Hanoi, and saying to the Vietcong, 'OK, we've got Saigon. Hanoi, you wanna play in the woods, you play in the woods'. I've been to five wars and I've always believed that victory is the fruit of the maximum application of force in the minimum of space and time. We should have gone to the heart rather than the fingertips.\" Turning to Chile, Walters also defends General Pinochet who was, he says, unfairly vilified for the overthrow of Salvador Allende. \"Before Pinochet moved, the Chilean chamber of deputies, the Chilean senate and the Chilean supreme court asked the armed forces to do something about the repeated violations of the constitution by Allende.\" A decade later, Walters, by then ambassador to the UN, was sent to tell Pinochet it was time to step down. Pinochet refused. \"He said to me, 'Walters, you are sent here to tell me to turn Chile over to a democracy. I'm going to when it's ready to support a democracy, but frankly I'm a better judge of that than anybody in the state department.' He had a civil war on his hands, but when the time came he turned it over.\" For all his toughness, Walters can be very forgiving. He is happy to forgive Nixon for his misjudgments over Watergate. \"Nixon was the most intelligent president of the United States, but he made one fatal mistake. He asked me [about Watergate] and I said to him, 'Mr President, every poll showed that you would carry every state except one, so what were these lunatics doing breaking into the Democratic national committee? What did they expect to find there? There are 150,000 files.' I said 'Mr President, if you had called a press conference and said that two of your subordinates, because of misguided loyalty, had performed acts which were not compatible with their functions, so you had asked for and obtained their resignations, that would have been the end of it.'\" Walters, as deputy director of the CIA during the crisis, came close to being sucked into the murky waters engulfing the administration. \"I'd been there six weeks when the legal counsel of the White House [John Dean] calls me and says, 'We'd like you to pay the burglars of the Watergate building out of CIA secret funds'. I said, 'The CIA had nothing to do with it, and I'm not going to implicate them in it'. He pressed me three times. I said, 'Mr Dean, if you call me again I'm going to the president with my resignation; I'm going to tell him why and I'm going to hold a press conference.' I never heard from him again. But I did get a medal from the CIA for saving them.\" What he didn't get was the top job at the organisation. Why not? \"Congress was in a very anti-military mood because of Vietnam. They wouldn't have confirmed a military officer for that.\" Accompanying Walters is his nephew, Peter, a tall ex-army man. During the interview, he has been reading the Telegraph and is horrified by the attacks on press freedom in Zimbabwe. \"Maybe we should intervene there too,\" he volunteers. I think he is joking, then realise he isn't. The global cavalry are ready to ride. \u00b7 The Mighty and the Meek is published by St Ermin's Press (\u00a320)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
