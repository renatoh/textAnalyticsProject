Don\u2019t read on unless you have watched episode one. \u2018Are we people who keep secrets from each other? Is that our thing now?\u2019 The message this week is clear: buy your children earplugs, and make them mandatory. The multiple secrets being carried by the women bubbled up to the surface abruptly, because children listen, and talk. It all tumbled out as the episode progressed: Perry\u2019s violence towards Celeste; Jane being \u201csalted\u201d (how heartbreaking) by Perry; Ziggy and the twins learning that Perry was Ziggy\u2019s father; and Madeline\u2019s affair with the theatre director. The kids may be all right, but they\u2019re terrible at keeping anything to themselves. Family relationships were at the heart of the episode. Celeste has no family to speak of, and the isolation of her situation appealed to Perry, as a horrible flashback revealed. Eventually, when Mary Louise learned the truth about Ziggy, Celeste tried to tell her mother-in-law about Perry\u2019s violence, but she wasn\u2019t having any of it, and barely even seemed to listen. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t capable,\u201d she insisted, using the fact that Celeste did not go to the police as evidence that she was lying. The show can be very clever at examining the idea of complicity; it\u2019s something that also comes up in Celeste\u2019s therapy sessions, where she is clearly continuing to see herself as responsible for Perry\u2019s violence. Then there\u2019s Bonnie\u2019s mother, invited to stay by Nathan in an attempt to get through to her, though her presence is unsettling and there are hints that all is not well between them \u2013 a mention of previous alcoholism here, a crystal and a feather there. Zoe Kravitz is doing an excellent job of showing Bonnie being haunted by her conscience (the title of the episode, of course, is a nod to Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s classic story of a murderer consumed by guilt), and it rectifies one of the only flaws in the first season, which was that Bonnie was underwritten and underused. For all of the emotional subtleties of Bonnie and Celeste\u2019s storylines, there is a kind of light relief in Renata\u2019s fury at losing everything thanks to her feckless husband \u2013 Laura Dern really goes for it \u2013 and in Madeline butting heads with Mary Louise, while Ed and Nathan\u2019s rivalry continues to be pleasingly silly. But for the most part, this was a gut-wrenching week for the Monterey Five. Jane\u2019s distress at having to tell Ziggy about Perry, particularly after that sense of freedom she had last week, that she was moving on with her life, was sad, and kudos to Shailene Woodley for that performance. Notes and observations Last week\u2019s premiere gave the world the Scream, which has already fuelled countless Meryl Memes. Competing for the crown this week, though, is Nicole Kidman\u2019s guttural \u201cNooooooo\u201d, followed closely by Laura Dern\u2019s \u201cI will not not be rich!\u201d. Memes, surely, are imminent. \u201cBabe, you gotta be careful with Ambien.\u201d Madeline\u2019s advice to Celeste might have served Roseanne Barr well. I\u2019m finding Meryl\u2019s teeth a little distracting, and I am not the only one. One solution to everyone\u2019s woes might be to ban communal eating in Monterey. Every time a family sits down for a meal, it ends in something terrible coming out. If Bonnie\u2019s mother truly has the vision, then who is in danger of drowning? Playlist The BLL Spotify playlist can be found here and is extremely comprehensive. As Bonnie was being tailed in her car, she was listening to Brenton Wood\u2019s Great Big Bundle of Love. Charles Bradley\u2019s Let Love Stand a Chance was playing while Jane and Bonnie are at yoga. Madeline chopped tomatoes to Elle King\u2019s Good Thing Gone. Renata really is over What Becomes of the Broken-Hearted, isn\u2019t she? Mary Louise\u2019s insult of the week \u201cI don\u2019t like her ... well, I have tried, but she\u2019s not a likable person.\u201d Here\u2019s to the inevitable Mary Louise/Madeline showdown in the penultimate episode."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
