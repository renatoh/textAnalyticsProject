On the same day as the government-commissioned Vickers report outlines plans for reforming UK banks, the TUC's general secretary, Brendan Barber, will urge trade unions to \"shift the debate\" away from deficit reduction and on to building a new economy. As this week's TUC conference begins at its headquarters in London, plans will also be announced to raise a \u00a32m fighting fund against public spending cuts via a 10p levy on its more than 6 million members. In his keynote speech on Monday Barber will say that repairing the public finances can be achieved only by creating jobs and growth through building a \"new economy\" around green technologies, retaining the 50p tax rate and forcing banks to lend to companies. \"On a day when the Vickers report fails to deal with what really needs to be done to transform our banks, let's argue for real reform of our financial system, turning the banks from casinos that enrich themselves to utilities that serve us,\" Barber will say. \"We have to win the case for an economic alternative.\" Under the Project Merlin accord banks are required to hit lending targets to businesses, including \u00a376bn to small and medium-sized businesses this year. According to lending data for June, the net monthly flow of lending was a negative \u00a33.1bn, meaning more money was repaid to banks than was lent out. While critics of the trade union movement and the Labour party say the organisations have no tangible alternative to the coalition government's defict-reduction programme, Barber will say that the TUC and the 55 unions it represents have to \"win the intellectual debates as well as the industrial battles \u2026 We've got to build a mass movement for change. This year we had a March for the Alternative. In the year ahead I want us to build a Movement for the Alternative.\" Describing the government's deficit-reduction programme as a \"major smuggling operation\", Barber will accuse ministers of implementing \"contraband\" policies such as NHS reform \u2013 despite electoral pledges not to cut the health service. Health could become one of the major industrial battlegrounds this autumn, with unions representing staff at every level of the NHS considering co-ordinated action if pension reform talks fail. Barber will argue that spending cuts are driven by ideological as well as economic imperatives: \"What worries me is that those in the driving seat are pushing forward an agenda to permanently shrink the state,\" he will say. \"For them this isn't temporary pain, but the culmination of a long-held dream \u2013 a chance to implement policies under cover of the crash that they know voters have rejected over and over again.\" He adds that the cuts have elongated Britain's economic slowdown by sucking money out of the economy and \"stamping on growth\". George Osborne admitted last week that he would have to cut his UK growth forecast when he delivers his autumn statement on 29 November. Many City economists believe that the economy, which has grown by 0.2% in the nine months to June, will grow by 1% this year and will continue to be sluggish in 2012. Barber will say: \"It's marketisation and privatisation on a huge scale \u2013 warmer words when they are wrapped up as localism and the big society \u2013 but the same old hard-right ideology. What is even worse is that it's hurting, but it ain't working.\" The TUC general secretary believes that without a reversal of the spending cuts \"the best we can look forward to is bumping along the bottom for years\". In a statement of intent over the trade union movement's fight against the cuts, the TUC's general council has drawn up plans for an additional levy on its members. The 10p-per-member contribution for the next two years will generate a \"campaign fund\" of \u00a31m per year to pay for events such as the March for the Alternative in March that drew about 500,000 people to London. \"This will establish a campaign fund of \u00a31 million a year, which will be managed by the executive committee to deliver the most vital campaign for our movement in a generation.\" However, a trade union source warned that the levy is \"not a formality\" and will be considered by the TUC's general council next month. The general council statement adds: \"Unions will continue to take industrial action when appropriate, and the TUC remains ready to co-ordinate union activity.\" Talks over reforming public sector pensions resumed last week, led by Barber. Negotiators remain pessimistic about reaching an agreement but there was some positive news from talks on the local government pension scheme when ministers postponed an official consultation on reforming the scheme on Friday. It halted a move that union negotiators had warned would have destroyed hopes of a deal, accelerating the prospect of industrial action. Nonetheless, talks over changing pensions for health, education and civil service professionals are progressing more slowly. Meanwhile the RMT, the most powerful rail union, warned Sunday that it will bring trains to a halt in a national strike if the government pushes ahead with reforms outlined in an independent report this year. The McNulty study argued that \u00a31bn a year can be saved by removing conductors from services and reducing ticket offices. Proposals to remove thousands of signallers' jobs by Network Rail, the owner of Britain's tracks and stations, have also riled the RMT. Bob Crow, RMT general secretary, said: \"If the government decide to push on with the plans, we are making it clear that every worker will be balloted for action right across the industry.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
