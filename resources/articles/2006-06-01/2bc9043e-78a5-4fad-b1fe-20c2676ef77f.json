Perhaps this uncharacteristic pre-tournament fatalism had something to do with the fact that Andy Murray has started to seem of late a bit less like all-conquering Wayne Rooney and a bit more like not-quite-grown-up Theo Walcott. Or maybe it was because for the first year in a decade not even the most sentimental Home Counties granny, or the manufacturers of Persil, or even me (though I had put my time-honoured tenner on him) could really convince themselves that this was to be Tim's year. Whatever the reason, I thought, the men's draw at Wimbledon has rarely looked, to British eyes, more of a formality. Last week, when the seeding committee did their traditional 'we, and not some unfeeling computer, will decide who the best tennis players in the world are' even their hearts did not quite seem to be in it. They had a new formula; they talked of transparency, but - in the absence of a Goran Ivanisevic or a Richard Krajicek - the only real beneficiary of the behind-closed-doors grass-court handicapping system was Andy Roddick, who went up a couple of places. And Roddick in particular seemed representative of the general sense of inevitability. Wimbledon depends in part on stereotypical oppositions: brash Americans against subtle Europeans. Far from spearheading an American challenge to Federer's dominance, though, the Texan seemed suggestive, having already apparently given it his best shot a couple of times, of the curiously waning power of the American game. If we Brits have long since fallen into the role of terminal underachievers, the same thought is becoming entrenched in the United States. It is three years since the last American grand-slam victory by a man and Roddick, the only realistic hope, appears to have reached the point with Federer that Jimmy Connors once reached with Bjorn Borg: however hard he hit the ball, it always came back. And if 147mph serves are not enough to worry the champion, then you can be sure that he will not be fretting too much about the other American seeds: James Blake, to whom he has never lost a set, the journeyman Robby Ginepri and Andre Agassi, surely this time in his last year at the All England Club. The two players in Federer's age group who once seemed most able to unsettle him have also slipped away: Marat Safin, who briefly looked capable of anything, now seems content to spend the millions he has earned in Monte Carlo. (I remember talking to him once, when he was already in decline, at 22. How did he spend his time away from the game, I asked. 'I buy cars,' he said. 'Lots of cars.') Lleyton Hewitt, too, still the most ardent of competitors, appears to have allowed the one thing that he always feared most - doubt - to afflict his matches with Federer. He is one of only two seeds to have defeated the three-time champion on grass, in Holland in 2001, but he knows way down in his Aussie soul that while Federer is fit and competing he will in all likelihood not win another Wimbledon. While Arvind Parmar talked through the possibilities of the draw on the radio, I looked down the remaining list of pretenders, marking anyone else that might be capable of taking a set or two off Federer. Only three names stood out. One was David Nalbandian, the indefatigable Argentine who was for a while the champion's nemesis and who is one of the few players to have beaten him in a final (even if it took him four-and-a-half hours last year in Shanghai). Mario Ancic, the Croat, who is the last person to beat Federer at Wimbledon, was another. And Rafael Nadal was the third. The extraordinary Spaniard has not so far found himself a place in the British tennis imagination because he has never done anything at Wimbledon. At the moment he seems fated to be a Guillermo Vilas or a Gustavo Kuerten, a player who tries everything he knows on grass and eventually gives up. But still, anyone who saw him overpower Federer in Paris earlier this month will know he is not easily defeated. The more I thought about some of these possible matches, the more the tournament started to take on some of its former magic. And then, on the radio, the Wimbledon draw committee, ever impartial, did their bit to raise the excitement levels. How uncannily fortunate that the draw, in this World Cup month, should have thrown up so many intriguing first-round matches. That it should have matched the warhorse Greg Rusedski with the redundant Safin, that it should have pitched Britain's Alex Bogdanovic (once a wunderkind, now a wildcard) against Nadal. That Murray should have the chance of beating the Olympic champion (and grass-court no-hoper) Nicolas Massu. And that the draw should have found precisely the two opening matches that Federer, one win away from beating Borg's consecutive grass-court record of 41, would probably least have wanted: Richard Gasquet, fresh from winning in Nottingham, who came within a couple of points of beating Federer in Germany the previous week, followed by Henman. Suddenly, I couldn't help thinking that my time-honoured tenner looked like a tidy bit of business. If Tim could do it just once, then his path to the final looked... That's the thing about Wimbledon: anything is possible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
