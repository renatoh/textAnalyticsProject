The 150 staff - mainly catering, maintenance, kennel and admin workers - are to have talks over transfers or redundancies over the next three months. The restructuring plans are aimed at making the charity's income and expenditure balance by the end of 2004. It has suffered huge losses as a result of the stock market slump. \u00a320m was lost on its stock portfolio last year, and GDBA overspent its \u00a340m income by \u00a316m. That comes after 10 years where the charity's expenditure exceeded its income by an average of \u00a311m a year. It receives no government grants, relying instead on fundraising, donations and a declining number of legacies. Earlier this year GDBA announced the closure of two of its 15 residential training centres, at Middlesbrough and Exeter. Today, it said the remaining 13 across the UK would also cease residential training although four - at Leamington Spa, Bolton, Forfar and London - will remain open to provide initial training for guide dogs. It said the residential centres were uneconomic, and often 89% empty. The Middlesbrough centre alone cost \u00a31m a year to run and yet only catered for around 100 users per year - an average cost of \u00a310,000 per person. The centres will be replaced by 31 district teams providing locally-based training and support to guide dog owners. GDBA said many blind people had said they preferred to be introduced to new guide dogs in their own homes rather than having to book into residential centres for three weeks. The charity is also exploring the possibility of hiring wings of small hotels or university halls of residence during holiday time to replace its own residential facilities. GDBA said it hoped to keep redundancies to a minimum but needed to stem its losses in order to ensure it could continue to support its 4,800 guide dog owners. Its chief executive, Geraldine Peacock, said: \"It is imperative that we keep pace with the changing needs of our service users whilst also securing our long-term financial future. \"The proposals we are now putting forward will enable us to be more flexible in our local service delivery and put our finances on a firm footing. \"By removing much of the association's fixed overheads, we will be investing in people and services, not bricks and mortar.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
