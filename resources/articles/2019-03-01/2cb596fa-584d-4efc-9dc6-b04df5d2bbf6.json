And if you know this club, you know what that slogan means. \u201cThis means more\u201d was the name of the promotional campaign attached to the launch of a new kit last year. J\u00fcrgen Klopp narrated the accompanying video and it is a classic insight into the Liverpool PR machine. \u201cFor others, it\u2019s sport,\u201d goes one line, \u201cfor us, it\u2019s a way of life. They have a stadium, we have a home \u2026 they have songs, we have an anthem \u2026 they have supporters, we have a family.\u201d The video cuts to some old footage of Bill Shankly. \u201cThey have a manager,\u201d Klopp says. \u201cWe have a guardian.\u201d On the approach into Anfield there are more of those red banners \u2014 \u201cStadium/Home\u201d and \u201cSongs/Anthem\u201d and \u201cDream/Believe\u201d \u2013 to continue the theme. It is different here, they are saying. Special, unique, better. More history, more meaning, more glory. And, yes, if you support another team it might cross your mind that Liverpool are pushing their luck somewhat to position themselves this way, 29 years since their last league title. What you won\u2019t be able to argue with is the kaleidoscope of banners that decorate Anfield on the European nights, in remembrance of Istanbul, 2005, as well as Rome, 1977 and 1984, plus Wembley, 1978, and Paris, 1981. Or the large red flag that is often seen at their away games, showing those five European Cups and one simple line, in capital letters, that is intended for their rivals and virtually unanswerable if you understand the tribal nature of football rivalry. \u201cNo wonder you hate us,\u201d it says. The problem for Liverpool is what can happen when all that history threatens to weigh the club down. We know they value the power of the soundbite. We know Klopp, like Brendan Rodgers before him, has bought into all that rhetoric. Yet this is the time Liverpool need to supply the hard evidence of their title credentials now they are the chaser rather than the chased, four points behind Manchester City, and we have seen before what can happen to them at the business end of the season, when the heat of the battle is rising dangerously close to intolerable. Five years ago, on the last occasion they locked horns with City this way, Liverpool were in such a position of strength one recruitment firm advertised for stewards to work on a \u201chistoric day\u201d, namely the winners\u2019 parade. Seven different books had been commissioned to tell the story of a momentous season, to be rushed out that summer. None, however, had a happy ending and if you have read chapter eight, The Slip, of Steven Gerrard\u2019s autobiography, published a year later, you will have a better understanding how the pressure got to him. Gerrard freely admits he was in turmoil even before the game against Chelsea when his now-infamous mistake let in Demba Ba. With three games to play, Liverpool had been six points clear of a Manchester City side that had a match in hand. Gerrard, to give him his due, has never ducked the truth: they blew it. With that kind of backdrop, perhaps it is just inevitable many people suspect the biggest problem for Liverpool might be themselves. That, however, is not entirely true: the biggest problem for Liverpool is the quality of the team that is directly above them. Yet it is fair to say the coming weeks will be a serious test of their nerve and, strange as it is, perhaps it might work in their favour that the current team does not have anybody with Gerrard\u2019s tremendous sense of responsibility towards the club. Gerrard, if anything, was too wrapped up in it, too wrought, barely able to sleep when a title run-in should be a time for clear heads. Perhaps you saw his interview a few days ago when he confirmed what we probably already knew: that it still wounds him even now. His book goes into more detail, such as the flight back from London, after the 3-3 draw at Crystal Palace that had torpedoed Liverpool\u2019s hopes again, and the plane hitting some heavy turbulence. Gerrard turned to the club\u2019s physiotherapist, Chris Morgan, in the next seat and told him that if the plane went down he was not going into the brace position. It wasn\u2019t intended as gallows humour. \u201cI meant it,\u201d Gerrard writes. \u201cI was ready to surrender. If we were going down, well, sod it. I\u2019d had enough.\u201d Five years on, Liverpool might have to win eight of their remaining nine fixtures, if not them all, if they are to remind themselves what it is like to be league champions. None of their supporters below the age of 35 will even remember the last time it happened in 1990, in the same week the Berlin wall started to come down. It feels like an obsession. Of course there is going to be apprehension when Liverpool have lost a seven\u2011point lead and, as they keep being reminded, no team in the Premier League era has gone into the new year in that position and failed to finish the job. Of course there will be doubts and Klopp should realise he will not soothe those anxieties by taking out his frustrations on reporters, as happened in front of the television cameras at Everton last weekend, or blaming the various weather conditions and becoming involved in the sort of exchange with a ball-boy that evoked memories of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho doing something similar at Crystal Palace one time (including some paternal guidance from Mourinho to the tracksuited youngster that \u201cone day somebody will punch you\u201d). Equally, let\u2019s not overlook the fact Liverpool have already accrued 70 points when, to put that into context, that is more than Manchester United managed at the same stage in 11 of Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s 13 championship wins. Liverpool have lost only once all season and are eight points better off at the 29-game mark than the nearly year, 2013-14, when Luis Su\u00e1rez was picking off opposition defences. Remember the Newcastle United side, aka the Entertainers, that led the way at this stage of the 1995-96 championship chase? Klopp\u2019s men have scored nine more goals than Kevin Keegan\u2019s team and taken six more points. Plus it is a remarkable statistic, for such an adventurous side, that Liverpool have let in only 15 goals so far. Even in this difficult run, when they have been restricted to 10 points out of a possible 18 and one newspaper has superimposed Klopp\u2019s face on to Keegan\u2019s for his own \u201clove it\u201d meltdown, they have kept clean sheets in their last four league fixtures, and another against Bayern Munich in the Champions League. Indeed, there is only one manager who has made it to this stage of a Premier League season with a superior defensive record and that was Mourinho with Chelsea, in his absolute pomp. Only once, though. The issue for Liverpool is more that their front players have not always found their usual sureness of touch. Mohamed Salah, for example, has not scored in his last four appearances. That might not sound a big deal but it will be his longest run for Liverpool without a goal if four becomes five against Burnley on Sunday. The reigning player of the year, for both the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association and the Football Writers\u2019 Association, has scored in only one of Liverpool\u2019s away fixtures since the turn of the year and, most revealingly, only four games all season against top\u201110 opponents, none involving the current top five. Salah has been a great player for Liverpool, a truly great player, and it is not straightforward to question a footballer with his precious magic. There is, however, a difference between a great footballer and a footballing great. If Salah can bridge the gap from one to the other during the next nine games, Liverpool can still consider the league is open with all sorts of possibilities. The alternative, for the club where \u201cthis means more\u201d, is barely worth thinking about. Ince does himself a disservice by failing to credit Solskj\u00e6r By now, we can all assume Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r will be the next full-time manager of Manchester United. If anything, it was probably agreed even before the Champions League win in Paris, but it would be bordering on ludicrous if the club looked elsewhere now and no surprise whatsoever if it turned out the terms had already been settled behind the scenes. What isn\u2019t quite so clear is when Paul Ince is planning to abandon this increasingly grizzled line that a number of other former United players all had it in them to turn the club around the same way. \u201cWhen I said \u2018anyone\u2019 could have done the job Ole has done, I didn\u2019t literally mean anyone,\u201d Ince now clarifies. \u201cI\u2019m not saying any Tom, Dick or Harry could have come in. I\u2019m talking about players who have played for the club and gone on to manage.\u201d And we all know who he means, first and foremost. Himself. Ince did indeed do a splendid job to keep Macclesfield up in 2007 after inheriting a side seven points adrift at the bottom of the entire Football League. He also led Milton Keynes Dons to promotion the following year, so it would not be fair to say his managerial career has lacked highlights. Since then, however, not so much. Ince lasted 17 games at Blackburn Rovers, winning only three of them, after getting his chance in the Premier League. He then went back to Milton Keynes but could not make it work the second time and has had five years out of the sport since undistinguished spells at Notts County and Blackpool. More than anything, he doesn\u2019t seem to appreciate that one of the reasons why Solskj\u00e6r has made Old Trafford a happy place again, why the players are actively campaigning for the interim manager to get the job properly and why he is such a breath of fresh air compared to the last guy, is that the Norwegian possesses an old-fashioned quality that not everyone in this industry appears to have: humility. A Spurs yes man? A special mention today to the Twitter user who set up the account in the name of \u201cIs the Spurs stadium ready yet?\u201d some time last October (a little late themselves, admittedly) and has been religiously posting the same single-word update \u2013 \u201cno\u201d \u2013 every day since. Only a few more weeks now and, though I doubt it is a Tottenham supporter behind the account, I just hope it has been worth the (very long) wait now that, finally, he or she can look forward to typing in the word \u201cyes\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
