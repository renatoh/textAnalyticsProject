That can lend it a certain banality \u2013 opener God Save Our Young Blood, for instance, is characterised solely by hollow glamour (an aesthetic mastered by fellow manufacturer of listless minimalist pop, Lana Del Rey, who provides guest vocals) \u2013 but elsewhere there is slightly richer fare. We Don\u2019t Care boasts a glam stomp softened for the palatability of Spotify playlist curators, while Sweet Dreams is a lightly psychedelic slice of sad-lad pop that bemoans the callousness of a lover while paying heavy homage to Tame Impala\u2019s Currents. In fact, much of this record seems to resemble the Aussie band\u2019s sad and groovy 2015 breakup album, from the full-bodied Faded Heart to shrill self-empowerment anthem I Don\u2019t Want U Back (which could have easily slotted into a Little Mix tracklist). Its influences result in a record that is full of hypnotic melodies and easy charm, but you couldn\u2019t claim Blue Madonna heralds the birth of a particularly distinctive talent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
