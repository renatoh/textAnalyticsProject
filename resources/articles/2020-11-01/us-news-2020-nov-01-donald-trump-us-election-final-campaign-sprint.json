As he did so, it was reported that he is planning to declare victory on Tuesday, before the result is called. Citing three anonymous sources \u201cfamiliar with his private comments\u201d, the news site Axios said Trump \u201chas told confidants he\u2019ll declare victory on Tuesday night if it looks like he\u2019s \u2018ahead\u2019. \u201cThat\u2019s even if the electoral college outcome still hinges on large numbers of uncounted votes in key states like Pennsylvania,\u201d the site said, adding: \u201cTrump has privately talked through this scenario in some detail in the last few weeks, describing plans to walk up to a podium on election night and declare he has won. \u201cFor this to happen, his allies expect he would need to either win or have commanding leads in Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, Texas, Iowa, Arizona and Georgia.\u201d Trump denied the Axios story, describing it as false, but then confirmed he would try to shut down vote counting as soon as the polls close on Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that we have to wait for a long period of time after the election,\u201d the president told journalists in North Carolina \u201cAs soon as the election is over \u2013 we\u2019re going in with our lawyers.\u201d Asked about the Axios report, Trump\u2019s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, said: \u201cMy response is the president\u2019s not gonna steal this election.\u201d According to FiveThirtyEight.com, Trump leads in Ohio, Texas and Iowa while Biden is up in Florida, North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona. The races are all exceptionally tight: the biggest lead in the FiveThirtyEight.com polling average is Biden by three points in Arizona, the smallest Trump by 0.2 in Ohio. Under the coronavirus pandemic, early and mail-in voting has reached unprecedented levels, fuelling expectations of record turnout but also fears many states will take longer than usual to count their ballots. Trump\u2019s tactics, Axios said, will depend on continuing to claim without evidence ballots counted after election day are illegitimate and evidence of voter fraud. Vote counting after election day is a regular feature of US elections. In another twist on the campiagn trail, the FBI confirmed on Sunday that it was investigating an incident in which a convoy of vehicles flying Trump flags surrounded a bus carrying campaign staff for Democratic challenger Joe Biden on a Texas highway. \u201cFBI San Antonio is aware of the incident and investigating,\u201d special agent Michelle Lee, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in San Antonio, told Reuters in an email. \u201cNo further information is available at this time.\u201d Many of Trump\u2019s claims about alleged fraud have focused on Pennsylvania, where the race is close but where votes counted after 3 November are expected to favour Biden who leads most national and battleground polls. Both candidates campaigned heavily in the state this weekend. \u201cPennsylvania is critical to this election,\u201d Biden told a drive-in rally in Philadelphia on Sunday evening, describing the president as an obstacle to defeating the pandemic. \u201cTo beat the virus we\u2019ve first got to beat Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s the virus.\u201d Democrats have long worried that Trump will declare victory early, aiming to sow uncertainty and legal battles over ballots and results. Some observers have called the tactic the \u201cred mirage\u201d, which former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro said this week \u201csounds like a super villain, and it\u2019s just as insidious\u201d. \u201cOn election night, there\u2019s a real possibility that the data will show Republicans leading early, before all the votes are counted,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThen they can pretend something sinister\u2019s going on when the counts change in Democrats\u2019 favour.\u201d On Sunday, on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Biden adviser Anita Dunn said she thought the victor would be known some time on 4 November, the day after election day. \u201cA lot of the early states that are battleground states, especially in the Sunbelt, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, are states that tend to get their votes counted on election night,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cI think we will get some sort of indicator what kind of night it\u2019s going to be from those three states. We will see. Obviously, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin may be slower.\u201d The Pennsylvania official in charge of elections, secretary of state Kathy Boockvar, a Democrat, told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press there could be 10 times as many mail-in ballots than in 2016 and added: \u201cI expect that the overwhelming majority of ballots in Pennsylvania, that\u2019s mail-in and absentee ballots, as well as in-person ballots, will be counted within a matter of days.\u201d Axios said the Trump campaign was bullish about key states including Texas, Nevada, North Carolina, Arizona and Wisconsin. On ABC\u2019s This Week, Trump adviser Jason Miller claimed: \u201cIf you speak with many smart Democrats, they believe President Trump will be ahead on election night, probably getting 280 electoral [votes], somewhere in that range. And then they\u2019re going to try to steal it back after the election. \u201cWe believe that we\u2019ll be over 290 electoral votes on election night. So no matter what they try to do, what kind of hijinks or law suits or whatever kind of nonsense they try to pull off, we\u2019re still going to have enough electoral votes to get President Trump re-elected.\u201d Miller\u2019s claim rested on the idea that all ballots must be counted on election day, a legal and political nonsense. Nonetheless, the Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told Axios: \u201cWhen he wins, he\u2019s going to say so.\u201d Trump\u2019s final 2020 tour, which began on Sunday in Michigan, is aimed at holding states he won four years ago and shoring up support in traditional Republican strongholds, like North Carolina and Georgia. Biden was due to hold two drive-in meetings in Pennsylvania, one of a string of former Democratic bastions in the north-east which Trump won from Hillary Clinton by less than a point. New polls showed Biden holding on to a lead in Pennsylvania. The New York Times and Siena College gave the Democrat a six-point edge, while the Washington Post and ABC showed a seven-point margin. In Michigan, Trump repeated some of the messages that worked in 2016, highlighting the impact of globalisation on the car industry. \u201cI gave you a lot of auto plants, so I think we\u2019re even,\u201d he told a crowd at a wind- and rain-swept rally in the town of Washington. One new car plant has been announced since Trump took office, while Michigan automotive jobs had fallen by 2,400 even before the Covid-19 pandemic. Employment in the sector is down more than 18,000 in the state, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Trump\u2019s other principal line of attack was to warn voters Biden would implement a drastic lockdown that would kill jobs. The president has insisted the nation has \u201cturned the corner\u201d despite record numbers of new cases across the country, and warnings of a spike in deaths over the winter. Trump has insisted on holding mass rallies with no social distancing, at which few wear masks. A study by Stanford University economists estimated at least 30,000 coronavirus infections and 700 deaths caused by 18 Trump rallies between June and September. \u201cWe\u2019re in for a whole lot of hurt,\u201d Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s leading expert on infectious disease, told the Washington Post. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good situation. All the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors. You could not possibly be positioned more poorly.\u201d A NBC and Wall Street Journal poll on Sunday put Biden up 10 points, a majority of voters saying they were unhappy with the president\u2019s handling of the pandemic and the direction of the country. The same poll four years ago had Clinton up but by only four. In 2016 there were many more undecided and third-party voters. The Trump camp has stepped up signals that they will look to Republican-leaning courts to cast doubt on the integrity of the enormous volume of postal ballots. In Texas, a federal court will hear a lawsuit on Monday aimed at having 117,000 votes in Houston thrown out because they were cast at curbside ballot boxes set up to make voting easier during the pandemic, which the Republican plaintiffs argue was illegal. The Texas supreme court has twice rejected a similar argument but a federal court in Houston has agreed to hear the case, presided over by an ultra-conservative judge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
