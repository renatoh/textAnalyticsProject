The Daily Mail writer used his intelligence to try and persuade female readers that if they were really bright enough to know their best interests they'd get back in the kitchen and give up the exhausting struggle to also hold down jobs. I suppose I ought to be glad that my sex has received this official recognition, but I can't help feeling they've given the game away. Of course there are things we're brighter at than men, but there's a lot of mileage to be gained from knowing when not to show it. While, of course, agreeing that we're bright enough to fly aeroplanes, master quantum physics and write prose, I would be sad to give up the ability to get men to fix computers, do something about the unsettling groan in the radiator or, for that matter, change a tyre \u2013 I've been taught that three times now, but so far have never actually had to do it. I can't help remembering the words of Miss Crystal, formidable Newnham don, who said: \"Feminism? My idea of feminism is that men should do exactly as I want. And I must say they mostly do.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
