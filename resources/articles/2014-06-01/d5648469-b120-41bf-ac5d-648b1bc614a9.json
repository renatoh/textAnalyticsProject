Here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 Isis fighters and allied groups took new territory in northern and western Iraq, including the city of Tal Afar, along a main route into Syria. \u2022 Isis claims that it had killed 1,700 Iraqi soldiers were questioned. But videos of Isis executions of Iraqi security forces stirred outrage. Some diagnosed a broader sectarian conflict to come. \u2022 Forces in Iraq engaged Isis and prepared for a larger confrontation. These included the Iraqi army, Kurdish peshmerga, Shia militias, Iranian fighters, volunteers and security forces. \u2022 Iranian and US officials discussed the Iraq situation on the sidelines of nuclear talks in Vienna. Both sides ruled out military cooperation, although US secretary of state John Kerry earlier in the day left the option open. \u2022 Kerry also said US air strikes in Iraq were an option. President Obama and national security advisors planned to meet Monday evening on Iraq. \u2022 An Iraqi army helicopter was reportedly shot down during clashes with militants west of Baghdad. \u2022 Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis were unable to return to their homes after they fled the Isis advance last week. A few of their stories are here and here. Reuters expands its snap report that US and Iranian officials held sideline talks on Iraq at the Vienna talks on Iran's nuclear program: \"The disastrous situation in Iraq was discussed today. No specific outcome was achieved,\" a senior Iranian official told Reuters of the talks on Iraq. \"Iran is a great country that can play a key role in restoring stability in Iraq and the region.\" \"Military cooperation was not discussed and is not an option,\" the senior Iranian official added. \"The final decision will be taken by capitals.\" Guardian US national security editor Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman) adds a note on the meeting President Obama has scheduled this evening with his national security team about Iraq. The Associated Press reported that the US is considering sending up to 100 Army Special Forces soldiers in an ostensibly advisory role to bolster the shaky Iraqi security forces. The complication: on Friday, Obama ruled out sending US ground forces back into combat. Here's Spencer: The key word there is combat \u2013 which leaves options open to Obama for some small US ground presence. Clarifies Caitlin Hayden, the National Security Council spokeswoman: \"The President was very clear that we will not be sending U.S. troops back into combat in Iraq. That remains the case and he has asked his national security team to prepare a range of other options that could help support Iraqi security forces. As you know, already over the past year we have been steadily increasing our security assistance to the Iraqi government, including training inside Iraq by the U.S. Embassy\u2019s Office of Security Cooperation and in Jordan; equipment; and intelligence.\" Obama has yet to reach a decision on US military force in Iraq. A complicating factor is the legal protections a potential ground force would enjoy after Iraq rejected granted legal immunity in 2011, which prompted the US military withdrawal. AFP has produced a video report on Iraqis taking refuge in Kurdistan after fleeing Mosul: UPDATE: It appears the video is not embeddable, but you can watch it on YouTube here. It's a 45-second video of scenes from inside an Iraqi refugee camp in Kurdistan. Features some cute kids. A Reuters snap [minus all caps]: Exclusive- US, Iranian officials discussed Iraq on sidelines of Vienna nuclear talks, sources familiar Laura Rozen is in Vienna: We have a new report on how the White House and Pentagon spent the day retreating from comments early in the day from secretary of state John Kerry that made the US seem open to military cooperation with Iran in the Iraq crisis: The Obama administration signalled for the first time on Monday that it was willing to enter into discussions with Iran over the advance of Islamist insurgents in Iraq, but stressed that any contact between the two adversaries would be informal and rejected an earlier suggestion by secretary of state John Kerry that military collaboration was a possibility. In an indication of how sensitive in Washington any such cooperation would be, officials quickly rowed back from remarks by Kerry, who had declined in an interview to rule out military cooperation with Tehran. But officials later insisted that any contact would be limited to informal discussions that would take place on the margins of nuclear talks in Vienna. [...] [State Department] spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that while there may be discussions about the political situation in Iraq, \"We're not talking about co-ordinating any military action with Iran.\" But the prospect of diplomatic, let alone military, cooperation between Washington and Tehran over the chaos in Iraq represents a dramatic turnaround for the two rival powers, whose relations, frozen for several decades, have only begun to thaw over the past year. Read the full piece here. The violence in Iraq is part of a broader Sunni Arab revolt, fugitive vice president Tarek al-Hashemi, a Sunni critic of Baghdad living in Istanbul, told Reuters on Monday. Hashemi said Sunnis have suffered \"injustice\" since the fall of Saddam Hussein: \"What happened in my country ... is desperate people revolted. Simple as that. Arab Sunni communities over 11 years faced discrimination, injustice, corruption,\" Hashemi said, rejecting the suggestion that militants from Isis alone were responsible. \"We do have about 11 to 12 armed groups, and they are being reactivated now. And we do also have political parties involved, we have ex-army officers, we have tribes, we have independent people in fact,\" Hashemi said. Hashemi, a Sunni sentenced to death in 2012 after an Iraqi court convicted him of running death squads while vice president, something he denies, has long accused Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki of a witch-hunt against his Sunni opponents. \"We have many groups beside ISIS. I am not going to deny that ISIS are existing, that ISIS are not influential. No, they are influential, very strong, could be a vanguard even in the whole operation in Mosul and other provinces, but they are not representing the whole spectrum of the groups,\" Hashemi said. Ali Khedery, a former adviser to US forces in Iraq, makes a similar point in an anxious Foreign Policy column: It wasn't ISIS alone that conquered a full third of Iraq in the past few days -- it was a full-blown Sunni insurgency consisting of ISIS, Sunni Arab Baath party elements from both Syria and Iraq, and the Iraqi and Syrian Sunni tribes that all joined to cooperate on beating back the Iranians and their proxies in Baghdad and Damascus. Many of these fighters are referring to their campaign as a \"revolution.\" (h/t @RayaJalabi) Here's a roundup of current news and opinion on Iraq in the Guardian (thanks to @RayaJalabi). Who are Isis? A Guardian panel of reporters and experts explains the group's origins and its current funding and tactics. Here's a paragraph from Rania Abouzeid's description of the goals of Isis and its split with al-Qaeda: Although they are now open rivals, ironically all three groups \u2013 Jabhat al-Nusra and Zawahiri's al-Qaida on the one hand, and Isis on the other \u2013 share the same goals: the creation of an Islamic state in Syria (and Iraq) and the return of the borderless Islamic caliphate, which ended in 1924 after the fall of the Ottoman empire. Over at our datablog, George Arnett and Sylvia Tippman compare Isis' finances with other military spending. Isis reportedly has some $2.38bn in cash and assets, according to digital files seized in a raid last week. Two points of comparison: According to Sipri (the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute), the Iraqi government spent $7.9bn [\u00a34.65bn] on defence in 2013. This was as a 284% increase on the amount spent in 2004. A report in October last year by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments said it cost the US army $2.1m per year for each solider deployed in Afghanistan during 2013. According to the latest Nato figures, there are over 32,000 US troops still there. Meanwhile, Nafeez Ahmed has written an interesting analysis on the Guardian's Earth Insight blog, tying the rise of Isis to the West's \"insatiable oil addiction\": The meteoric rise of Isis is a predictable consequence of a longstanding US-led geostrategy in the Middle East that has seen tyrants and terrorists as tools to expedite access to regional oil and gas resources. ... If we really wanted to shut down Isis and its ilk for good, we could start by dismantling and disentangling ourselves from the geopolitical and financial infrastructure of oil hegemony that incubates terror. In the current context, bombs promise nothing more than the road to escalation. Dominique Soguel of Middle East Eye has interviewed Iraqis from Mosul displaced by the Isis advance. Among the refugees is Um Zina, a pharmaceutical company employee: We didn\u2019t expect what happened. We woke up in the morning and there was no army, Mosul was taken over by insurgents. Buildings and police stations were on fire. We left. I have girls so I was scared for them because we don\u2019t know how things will play out in this situation. ... Thank God, they received us incredibly well in Kurdistan - they showed great hospitality. ... The rapid fall of these cities defies logic. It was a huge surprise to us. How is it possible that the army and the police fell apart in a matter of hours, while the government stands idly by? It\u2019s not possible, unless there is foul play. Read more interviews with Iraqis driven from Mosul here. (h/t: @RayaJalabi) The Associated Press picks up a report that also has appeared on Al-Jazeera of an Iraqi army helicopter shot down during clashes with militants west of Baghdad. The AP sources its report to unnamed Iraqi officials. The Guardian's Martin Chulov (@martinchulov) has filed a new dispatch from Baghdad. \"A rush of Shia paramilitaries and volunteers to battlelines about 60 miles north of the capital has slowed the Isis advance south and it now seems unlikely that the group could replicate its sweeping victories in Mosul and Tikrit,\" Martin writes: It remains unclear to whom the Shia irregulars will report when they reach the battlelines. The Iranian-backed Asaib ahl al-Haq has primacy among the paramilitaries and is extremely influential in government circles. \"No one is prepared to defy them,\" said Ammar Hussein, a resident of Karrada. \"They get what they want, and they will lead the fightback.\" Another man, a barber who signed up on Sunday to fight, said he believed that conditions had been fulfilled to fight a jihad, or holy war \u2013 which was called for by the highest Shia authority in Iraq, Ayatollah Ali Sistani, last Friday. \"Fighting for our dignity, our land and our sect are the three tenets,\" he said. \"But for me, this is a religious calling more than anything else. That is the main reason I am going to fight.\" Read the full piece here. At the Vienna nuclear talks, Laura Rozen of Al-Monitor reports that no discussion has yet been held on the Iraq crisis, but the key US and Iranian players are still on the scene. President Barack Obama will review suggestions for how to deal with the crisis in Iraq when he returns to Washington later on Monday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday. Reuters reports: \"The president will be updated on their ongoing efforts,\" Earnest told reporters returning from California with Obama. \"The goal of the president is to get an update on the thinking of individual members of his team as they've been working over the weekend to prepare some options,\" Earnest said. Unnamed Iraqi security officials have spoken with AP about what Qassem Suleimani, the commander of Iran's elite Quds Force, is doing in Iraq: The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, also said that U.S. aircraft have in recent days flown reconnaissance missions over Iraq to gather intelligence on the militants' positions. Soleimani has been inspecting Iraqi defenses and reviewing plans with top commanders and Iranian-backed Iraqi Shiite militias, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the visit. He set up an operations room to coordinate militias. He also visited the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala south of Baghdad, home to the most revered Shiite shrines, and areas west of Baghdad where government forces have faced off with Islamic militants for months. The Islamic State has threatened to march to Baghdad, Karbala and Najaf. Soleimani is one of the most powerful figures in Iran's security establishment. His Quds Force is a secretive branch of Iran's Revolutionary Guard involved in external operations. In the mid-2000s', it organized Shiite militias in a campaign of deadly violence against U.S. troops in Iraq, according to American officials. More recently, it has been involved in helping Syria's President Bashar Assad in his fight against Sunni rebels. The U.S. government was notified in advance of Suleimani's visit, Iraqi officials said. Read the full AP report here. White House spokesman Josh Earnest has redoubled the administration's pushback against the idea of US-Iranian military cooperation on Iraq, saying \"we're not interested.\" The idea emerged earlier in the day in remarks by senior administrations officials to reporters. Reuters reports on Earnest's remarks: \"Any of those conversations that may occur on the margins are entirely separate from the conversations about Iran's nuclear program,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters traveling with President Barack Obama. Any conversations with the Iranian regime will not include military coordination,\" Earnest said. \"We're not interested in any effort to coordinate military activities with Iran.\" A police officer in Baghdad says the Isis encroachment in the north has thrown the interior ministry into a state of \"great chaos\". Haider Khadier, 36, a father of three, spoke by telephone with the Guardian's Mona Mahmood (@monamood). \"I have worked as a policeman for the Ministry of Interior for few years... in the past week, my job took a dramatic form and I find myself running in panic between the Iraqi cities day and night,\" Khadier said. \"It ... reveals a great chaos overwhelming the ministry\": I was compelled to drive to Samara, Mosul and then Basra in a record time. Yesterday night, I got an order to put on my military uniform and head to Basra again. I really did not not know what was happening. I used to wear civilian clothes to hide my identity as a policeman among people, now I'm commanded like other Ministry of Interior staff to wear the uniform all the time. All the ministry of interior's drivers were directed to transport the military and police recruits to different cities in Iraq to fill the gap for those who have deserted and protect the two holy shrines in Samara. On the way to the city, I had to drive through the route of Ishaqi and Audhaim towns, where most of the ISIS fighters are based. [...] To my surprise, they were hiding in the groves and easily could spot my bus. They fired a barrage of bullets against the bus. Four military recruits were killed immediately. I do not know how I got to Samara with the other military elements and the four bodies. [...] In the morning my colleague took my bus and went to Mosul. At the end of the day, he came back by himself. The bus was hit by the ISIS shells and can't be used any more. The second day I was ordered to go to Mosul myself, but at the last moment I was told to head to Basra to bring some necessary equipment for the ministry. I was kept in Basra for three days, to arrive at 5 pm to Baghdad, but Iwas contacted again at 10 pm to come back to the Ministry. Khadier tells Mona about wartime profiteering on gas: I'm so desperate to get a spare time at least to buy my family a gas tube for cooking. The tubes are available in petrol stations in Baghdad, but some people found it a good chance to make money out of the current crisis. They began to buy 5 - 10 tubes of gas to sell. The petrol station sells the gas tube for 4,000 ID, but these people are selling it for more than 25,000 in other areas. Internet service providers in Iraq have been asked to shut down access to the internet in five provinces, according to a leaked letter on Iraqi Ministry of Communications letterhead. The Guardian's Raya Jalabi (@RayaJalabi) reports: The two-page document, dated 15 June and posted to the communication ministry's Facebook page here, asks 10 ISPs to shut off service \"completely\" in Ninawa, Anbar, Salaheddine, Kirkuk and Diyala provinces, in addition to blocking VPN access across Iraq from the hours of 4pm - 7am as well as blocking access to various social media networks. The move follows the blockage on Friday of most social media networks \u2013 including Facebook and Twitter \u2013 in an effort to limit dissemination of information and images of Isis executions of Iraqi security forces members, both false and not. An unofficial translation of the document can be found here, via SMEX. The ministry has not confirmed the directive apart from the Facebook post, and it's unclear whether the service providers would need to immediately comply. Iraq has tightened security and deployed extra troops around oil infrastructure and oilfields, a senior Iraqi security official told Reuters: Brigadier Moussa Abdul-Hassan, chief of the South Oil Police, said additional troops have been deployed around oilfields, energy facilities, drilling locations and oil companies' headquarters. \"We have doubled security measures to keep oilfield operations and companies 100 percent safe. Now we have more than 100,000 oil policemen on ground on high alert, ready to protect energy facilities in the south,\" Hassan told Reuters. \"We formed a crisis cell to closely monitor the security of foreign oil companies and we assured companies ... that their security is our top priority.\" Read the full report here. The Iraqi ambassador to the United States, Lukman Faily, is about to appear for an interview on Christiane Amanpour's show. Here is a video excerpt from British foreign secretary William Hague's address today to the House of Commons: Read our summary of Hague's speech here. As our live blog coverage continues, here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 Fighters under the banner of the Islamic state of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) continued to grab territory in northern Iraq on Monday, overrunning Tal Afar and consolidating control of Mosul, Tikrit and other areas. \u2022 Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis were unable to return to their homes in Isis-held areas. Isis claims that it had killed 1,700 Iraqi soldiers were questioned. But videos of Isis executions of Iraqi security forces stirred outrage. \u2022 Significant military force in multiple possible configurations was gathering to oppose Isis, which itself has drawn on the support of friendly local militias. \u2022 US secretary of state John Kerry said US air strikes \"may well be\" an option, while senior US officials said the administration was considering military cooperation with Iran, possibly to be discussed on the sidelines of nuclear talks in Geneva. \u2022 Senior US and Iranian leaders pushed back against the idea of US-Iranian cooperation, however. Read more here. \u2022 British foreign secretary William Hague said Monday that the UK has an \"important common interest with Iran\" over Iraq. Iranian president Hassan Rouhani has suggested Tehran was willing to consider working with the United States. \u2022 A large number of volunteers appeared at Iraqi recruiting centers to oppose Isis in battle. \u2022 The US confirmed that it had sent a second warship, carrying Marines and tilt-rotor aircraft, to the Gulf. It followed the carrier USS George H.W. Bush, which entered the Gulf over the weekend. \"In the place where I am, Irbil, we estimate that at least 100,000 people have come in over the last 48 hours,\" said UNICEF spokesperson in Iraq Jeffrey Bates in an interview (h/t: @Raya_Jalabi): The Iranian skeptics aren't alone: US defense officials are also pushing back against the idea that the US and Iran will cooperate on an Iraq military campaign. Guardian US national security editor Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman) submits an example: \"There has been no contact, nor are there plans for contact, between DoD and the Iranian military on the security situation in Iraq,\" said Lt. Cmdr. Bill Speaks, a Pentagon spokesman, referring to the Department of Defense. A number of senior Iranian officials have attempted to downplay prospects of cooperation between Iran and the US over Iraq, Saeed Kamali Dehghan reports (read earlier reports along these lines here). \u201cThe Islamic Republic of Iran has had no negotiations with the Americans over mutual cooperation in Iraq,\u201d the deputy foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said Monday. Saeed has further: Ali Shamkhani, who heads the powerful supreme national security council of Iran, a position previously held by president Hassan Rouhani, blamed the West for the turmoil in Iraq. \u201cThe spread of terrorism and its destructive effects, which are blatantly and covertly supported by certain so-called advocates of peace and security in the world and their regional allies, is a threat to human and moral principles and values,\u201d Shamkhani said. Alaeddin Boroujerdi, an influential MP who is the chairman of the Iranian parliament\u2019s national security and foreign policy commission, echoed Shamkhani. \u201cThe US support, arms shipments and military training [of the Takfiri groups] is the root cause of the spread of terrorism and inhumane crimes in the region,\u201d he said. On the other side of the question, the National Iranian American Council (NIAC), a Washington-based group, welcomed potential Iran-US talks over Iraq, Saeed writes: \u201cNews that the Obama administration will reach out to Iran over the security situation in Iraq is a welcome and sensible development that could strengthen the US response to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Shams (ISIS),\u201d NIAC said in a statement. Read that full statement here. Saeed also flags reports that the prime minister of Iraqi Kurdistan, Nechirvan Barzani, had travelled to Tehran on Monday to hold talks with senior Iranian officials on terrorism: A deputy foreign minister said Barzani was in Tehran offering explanations about \u201cambiguities\u201d regarding the activities of terrorist groups ion Iraqi Kurdistan. An organizer of a Baghdad center for conscripts has seen \"endless masses of volunteers\" to fight Isis, he tells the Guardian's Mona Mahmood (@monamood) in a phone interview. Nasir Farhan, a 55-year-old Shia man from eastern Baghdad and a father of six, is in charge of one of Baghdad's volunteering centers \u2013 recruitment centers that opened after a call to action by Iraq's top Shia cleric, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. \"Our volunteering centre opened in Al-Mashtal district, east of Baghdad,\" Farhan tells Mona: We have been receiving endless masses of volunteers flocking from different parts of Baghdad, pushed by their craving to fight ISIS terrorists and cripple their progress to Baghdad. Farhan said he believed that an extraordinary number of Iraqis, more than a million, had volunteered at centers around the country to fight Isis. The Guardian has not developed an independent estimate of volunteers. Martin Chulov in Baghdad reports \"the recruitment centres in Baghdad are literally overflowing with young lads wanting to join up an fight, along sectarian lines.\" Farhan tells Mona: Other than 10,000 men have volunteered to join the Badr brigade and other Shia Islamic resistance factions in Iraq in their struggle against ISIS barbarian terrorists in Iraq and Syria, despite the gruesome pictures of mass executions committed by these terrorists against the Iraqi military forces in Mosul. These acts can terrify any human being and they did terrify our military forces, but these volunteers are willing to die and sacrifice their lives for their country. As the number of the volunteers is booming, we decided to form committees for national mobilisation to [decide who is fit for] the army, because there are lots of elderly men and youngsters whom we can not send to fight in such a decisive battle. Farhan tells Mona that the centers has circulated forms for volunteers to fill in their details, but \"the volunteers are too fervent to fight and it is so difficult to convince them that they need to go home for the time being, at least to protect their neighbourhoods\": As we are trying to mobilise these volunteers, we are careful not to construct another army that would be in competition with the formal Iraqi army or could be viewed as a threatening militia for other Iraqi sects, defiantly we do not need to create more chaos than what we have now due to the military forces desertion of their bases. All what we are aiming at is to raise the morale of the Iraqi forces and to combat this vigorous attack by ISIS terrorists against our country. I can confirm that we have received even some Sunni volunteers who wanted to defend their country too. [...] None of these volunteers have been granted any weapons by these volunteering centres but it is the army forces responsibility to train them and supply them with the right arms. The British foreign secretary has concluded his address on Iraq to the House of Commons. Claire Phipps (@Claire_Phipps) summarizes: \u2022 The UK will not make a military intervention in Iraq. The US is \"looking at all options\", Hague said. \u2022 But the UK has sent a team of counter-terror experts to offer assistance. \u2022 Approximately 400 British nationals \"and other UK-linked individuals\" are fighting in Syria, some with Isis. \u2022 The UK has already pledged \u00a33m in humanitarian aid. \u2022 The UK government has an \"important common interest with Iran\" over Iraq. \u2022 Hague suggested he will announce tomorrow that the UK will strengthen diplomatic ties with Iran and possibly reopen its embassy in Tehran. \u2022 Hague says the situation in Iraq does not mean we should ignore long-term problems, such as sexual violence in conflict. Saeed Kamali Dehghan flags a Press TV report (in English) on a nuclear negotiator in Vienna downplaying prospective \"sideline\" talks on Iraq: British foreign secretary William Hague continues to speak before the House of Commons. He has said that Iran must cease support for sectarian groups elsewhere in the region \u2013 a nod to Syria and Lebanon \u2013 but he also has hinted at a continued rapprochement between the UK and Iran: Claire Phipps (@Claire_Phipps) has minute-by-minute coverage of Hague's speech over at our UK politics blog. The AP has a story on Christians in northern Iraq fleeing their homes to escape Isis: ALQOSH, Iraq (AP) \u2014 Over the past decade, Iraqi Christians have fled repeatedly to this ancient mountainside village, seeking refuge from violence, then returning home when the danger eased. Now they are doing it again as Islamic militants rampage across northern Iraq, but this time few say they ever want to go back to their homes. [...] \"I'm not going back,\" said Lina, who fled Mosul with her family as the militants swept in and came to Alqosh, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) to the north. \"Each day we went to bed in fear,\" the 57-year-old woman said, sitting in a house for displaced people. \"In our own houses we knew no rest.\" Like other Christians who fled here, she spoke on condition she be identified only by her first name for fear for her safety. In leaving, the Christians are emptying out communities that date back to the first centuries of the religion, including Chaldean, Assyrian and Armenian churches. The past week, some 160 Christian families \u2014 mosly from Mosul \u2014 have fled to Alqosh, mayor Sabri Boutani told The Associated Press, consulting first on the number with his wife by speaking in Chaldean, the ancient language spoken by many residents. Read the full piece here (h/t: @RayaJalabi) Contradicting his longtime Senate partner Lindsey Graham, the leading Senate critic of President Obama's foreign policy has rejected any outreach to Iran over Iraq as the \"height of folly,\" reports Guardian US national security editor Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman): In a new statement, Senator John McCain, (R-Ariz), whom Obama bested in the 2008 presidential election, rejected out of hand any possible US military or diplomatic cooperation with Iran, right as talks in Geneva between the two adversaries about coming to the Iraqi government's rescue appeared imminent. \"It would be the height of folly to believe that the Iranian regime can be our partner in managing the deteriorating security situation in Iraq,\" McCain said. He continued: This is the same Iranian regime that has trained and armed the most dangerous Shia militant groups, that has consistently urged Prime Minister Maliki to pursue a narrow sectarian agenda at the expense of national reconciliation, that supplies the rockets that have been fired at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, that has sponsored acts of terrorism throughout the Middle East and the world, and that continues to use Iraq\u2019s territory and airspace to send weapons and fighters to prop up Bashar al-Assad in Syria.\" The reality is, U.S. and Iranian interests and goals do not align in Iraq, and greater Iranian intervention would only make the situation dramatically worse. It would inflame sectarian tensions, strengthen the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), drive more Sunnis into ISIS\u2019s ranks, empower the most radical Shia militants, deepen the Iraqi government's dependence on Iran, alienate U.S. allies and partners in the region, and set back the prospects of national reconciliation. Spencer surveys what appears to be the developing US strategy that McCain is warning against: US Secretary of State John Kerry presaged cooperation on Iraq with Iran in a Monday interview, saying he would \"not rule out anything that would be constructive.\" The BBC reported that US and Iranian diplomats have returned to negotiations over the Iranian nuclear program in Geneva that are expected to include dialogue over a potential counterstrike against Isis militants in Iraq. Graham, McCain's closest Senate ally on foreign policy, said on Sunday that talking with Iran about Iraq was a realistic option. The Iranians are on the ground in Iraq, where the US has maintained a rump diplomatic presence since the 2011 military withdrawal. The British foreign secretary, William Hague, will shortly make a statement to the Commons on the situation in Iraq. You can follow coverage in real time on our London-based politics blog, and later we'll post a summary on this blog. As in the United States, some influential voices in Iran reject an Iranian-US military cooperation out of hand. The Financial Times quotes security official Ali Shamkhani: However, Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, rejected co-operating with the US, describing it as \u201cpsychological war and totally unreal\u201d. Read more here (permeable paywall requiring reader to answer two questions about news consumption) (h/t: @Ali_Gharib). Thomas Erdbrink, the New York Times correspondent in Tehran, selects a different line from Shamkhani, a call for unity: Senior US administration officials speaking to reporters on the condition of anonymity have confirmed that the US and Iran are poised to enter into a potentially groundbreaking military cooperation in Iraq, Guardian Washington correspondent Paul Lewis reports. An official downplayed talk of a sea change in the US-Iranian relationship, however. Paul writes: A senior US administration official, speaking to reporters on the condition of anonymity, said Washington and Tehran had previously held discussions over Afghanistan and communicated on other issues at the United Nations. \"There have been times when it made sense to be part of a conversation,\" the official said, before playing down the suggestion that cooperation over Iraq would significantly alter relations between the two countries. \"No-one should expect that all of a sudden, overnight, even if we resolve the nuclear agreement, that everything will change. It will not,\" the official said. \"The fundamentals remain exactly as they are. Until we resolve the nuclear issue there cannot be any kind of fundamental change in this relationship.\" Read the full piece here. Britain's Home Office has introduced emergency measures to ban the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant [Isis]. Under a draft order to the Terrrorism Act, is to become a proscribed organisation, making it a criminal offence to support the group. The order will be debated in parliament on Thursday before coming into effect on Friday. Britain's foreign secretary William Hague is due to give that Commons statement in the next 40 minutes or so. Politics live will be covering it in full. Kerry's interview with Yahoo News has now been published in full, together with this clip. On talks with Iran, Kerry said: Let\u2019s see what Iran might or might not be willing to do before we start making any pronouncements.\" I think we are open to any constructive process here that could minimize the violence, hold Iraq together, the integrity of the country and eliminate the presence of outside terrorist forces that are ripping it apart. I wouldn\u2019t rule out anything that would be constructive to providing real stability, a respect for the (Iraqi) constitution, a respect for the election process, and a respect for the Iraqi people to form a government that represents all of the interests of Iraq -- not one sectarian group over another. More from Kerry via Reuters. \ufeffAsked about the possibility of air strikes, Kerry said in an interview with Yahoo! News: \"They're not the whole answer, but they may well be one of the options that are important.\" \"When you have people murdering, assassinating in these mass massacres, you have to stop that. And you do what you need to do if you need to try to stop it from the air or otherwise,\" he added. Kerry also said the United States was \"open to discussions\" with Iran to help Iraq's Shi'ite-led government combat a Sunni Islamist insurgency. Meanwhile, the US has confirmed that a second war ship, carrying marines and tilt-rotor aircraft, has entered the Gulf. The USS Mesa Verde, an amphibious dock ship, is carrying 550 Marines, as well as MV-22 Osprey aircraft capable of quickly moving up to 22 marines at a time over long distances, AFP reported. \"It's presence in the Gulf adds to that of other US naval ships already there - including the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush - and provides the commander-in-chief additional options to protect American citizens and interests in Iraq, should he choose to use them,\" Rear Admiral John Kirby said. Kirby said the Mesa Verde has completed its transit through the Strait of Hormuz. It followed the carrier USS George H.W. Bush, which entered the Gulf over the weekend with two warships armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles: the destroyer USS Truxton and the cruiser USS Philippines Sea. The Bush carries 70 aircraft, including fighter jets and helicopters. Here's a summary of the latest developments: US Secretary of State John Kerry says the US is open to dialogue with Tehran about the crisis in Iraq. He comments come after a US official said that Washington was considering co-operating with Iran in tackling militants from Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant who have made sweeping gains in northern and central Iraq. Kerry also refused to rule out US air strikes in Iraq, as a second US war ship was deployed to the Gulf. In an interview with Yahoo News he said: \"They [airstrikes] may well be one of the options that are important.\" Britain's foreign secretary William Hague has held discussion with his Iranian counterpart about the crisis in Iraq. He again ruled out British military intervention in Iraq, but said the UK could help the Iraqi government in counter-terrorism operations. He is due to update the Commons on the crisis later today. Iran has sent out mixed signals on whether it would back US involvement in Iraq. President Hassan Rouhani suggested Tehran was willing to consider working with the US, but later an official said foreign involvement would only complicate the crisis. Meanwhile, a member of the Iran's special forces killed in the battle against Isis, has been buried in Tehran. Isis have seized control of the town of Tal Afar in northern Iraq after defeating tribal fighters. The Turkmon town is 260 miles north of Baghdad. Two days before Mosul fell to the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (Isis) Iraqi forces made an intelligence breakthrough against the group seizing 160 computer sticks containing detailed information about its leaders and collaborators in the Iraqi government. The treasure trove included names and noms de guerre of all foreign fighters, senior leaders and their code words, initials of sources inside ministries and full accounts of the group's finances. The US is evacuating some embassy workers from Baghdad, as Republicans slammed the Obama administration over the growing Middle East crisis. The Pentagon confirmed some staff were being relocated. But State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said: \"Overall, a substantial majority of the US embassy presence in Iraq will remain.\" The abduction of 2,000 soldiers by Isis and the killing of 30 over the weekend has exploded tensions between Iraq's Sunni and Shia sects. Photographs and videos released by the Sunni militant group, linked to al-Qaida, show some of the prisoners being killed, apparently in the desert near Tikrit, where they were seized on Tuesday. Some were lying face down with their hands tied. A separate group were forced to sit up while they were taunted by their captors. Tony Blair came under fierce attack from former Labour cabinet members, some diplomats and the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Ashdown after he called for limited military intervention to drive the militant group Isis out of Iraq and restore order in Syria. Blair said: \"The key thing is that they [Isis] need to know they're not going to be able to continue their push unhindered.\" London mayor Boris Johnson described the former prime minister as \"unhinged\" on Iraq. Saudi Arabia has called for the quick formation of a national consensus government in Iraq, blaming Baghdad's \"sectarian\" policies against Sunni Arabs for the unrest now sweeping the country, AFP reprots. The Sunni-dominated kingdom, whose relations with the Shia-led government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki have been strained, also warned against foreign meddling in Iraq after jihadist-led Sunni militants took control of vast swathes of territory north of Baghdad. The region's heavyweight, which shares long borders with Iraq expressed its \"serious concerns\" over developments in its neighbour. The unrest \"could not have taken place if it was not for the sectarian and exclusionary policies implemented in Iraq over the past years that threatened its stability and sovereignty,\" the Saudi government said in a statement. The Saudi statement urged a quick formation of a national consensus government to work to \"reinstate security and stability,\" stressing the need for the \"participation of all components of the Iraqi people in determining the future\" of the country. US secretary of state John Kerry has confirmed that the US is open to discussions with Iran over the conflict in Iraq. He also said US air strikes in Iraq may be an option for combating Isis insurgents. Reuters reports him telling Yahoo News that US is deeply committed to the intergrity of Iraq, and that the al-Maliki Shia-led government must do a better job of reaching out to sectarian groups. Kerry is also reported to have claimed that Isis militants pose a threat not just to Iraq and Syria but also Europe and the US. AP adds: Kerry said Washington is \"open to discussions\" with Tehran if the Iranians can help end the violence and restore confidence in the Iraqi government. Asked about possible military cooperation with Iran, Kerry said he would \"not rule out anything that would be constructive.\" However, he stressed that any contacts with Iran would move \"step-by-step.\" Iraqi security forces in Tikrit have been ordered to renounce the al-Maliki government after the city was overrun by Isis militants last week, a resident told the Guardian. Amjed Abdullah, a 50-year-old father of five, told Mona Mahmood that an uneasy calm now exists in the city. The Isis rebels held a meeting with those who have relatives in the army and the police, and the government. They said they had no plans to to punish any Iraqi men as long as they expressed repentance for working for the al-Maliki government. The rebels have set up specific centres for officials to denounce the government. The \"repentant\" have to submit a copy of their IDs and two photographs to be immune from punishment. The militants said their main goals is to overthrow the Maliki government in Baghdad not to punish the Iraqi people. Dozens of policemen and military forces headed to these centres but soon they came under an air strike by the the government aircraft. One of the centres was a mosque where crowds of recruits were gathering. A few of them were wounded. The rebels who are mainly locals from Tikrit are accompanied by some Arab fighters who are touring the city in cars brandishing flags of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. They have warned against looting in the absence of the military forces. Tribal leaders in the city have held meetings and appointed groups of men to maintain law and order. The rebels have ordered the local commander of the National Security, Jassim Jibara, and the head of the Awakening Councils, Winis Shiwash, to hand themselves in by the end of Monday. If they fail to do so the rebels say they will launch an attack on their suspected hideout. The governor of Tikrit, Ahmed Saleh, has fled to join the Iraqi military command base near the two shrines in the city of Samarra. At the moment Tikrit only has power supplies for a hour per a day, but there is no shortage in fuel. Tikrit university was opened today and salaries were handed to the staff. The Foreign Secretary William Hague has been in telephone talks with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif to see how the Iranians can play a role in easing the conflict in Iraq, writes Patrick Wintour. Downing Street said there was a role for the countries in the region to bring about co-operation and unity in Iraq. It is understood the British have been pressing the Iranians to persuade the al-Maliki government to adopt a less sectarian approach. Hague is expected to confirm the talks with the Iranians in the Commons statement due to be delivered at 3.30pm today. It is a remarkable sign of the thawing of relations between the West and Iran that the phone contact occurred. It is also an implicit acknowledgement that a settlement in the region is going to be impossible without Iran. Previously the British have resisted a role for Iran at the Geneva peace talks on the future of Syria. Number 10 is openly critical of the way in which the al-Maliki government has rejected pleas from Europe and America to adopt a less sectarian approach to government and the security forces. Meanwhile, US officials have confirmed that the crisis in Iraq may be dicussed on the margins of Monday's nuclear talks in Vienna, Paul Lewis reports. Iran's \"first martyr\" in the battle against Isis in Iraq has been buried in Tehran, Saeed Kamali Dehghan reports. He was named as Alireza Moshjari from a special unit of the ground forces of the Islamic republic\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, known as Saberin. Local news agencies published pictures of his funeral ceremony held in Tehran\u2019s Shahid Beheshti mosque which was attended by hundreds of men and women who carried his coffin. Tasnim news agency, which is affiliated to the Revolutionary Guards, said Moshjari was killed due to an accident \u201cin the West of the country\u201d on Friday while being involved in an operation. Iraq is situated in the west of Iran but Tasnim did not clarify whether he was killed in Iraqi soil but a group of conservatives websites said he was \u201cmartyred while helping Iraqi Shias in their battle against Takfiri Isis\u201d. The US ship Mesa Verde, carrying 550 Marines, has entered the Gulf to support possible US action to the help the Iraqi government, CNN reports. The USS Mesa Verde joins the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush, which the Pentagon ordered on Saturday to move into the Gulf. It is almost impossible to think of a single benign outcome from the US-led invasion of Iraq, according to Simon Jenkins, but rapprochement between the US and Iran could emerge as one silver lining. This crumb of diplomatic comfort is a welcome dash of sanity. Iran is by far the most powerful player in the emerging Sunni-Shia conflict. During America's 2012 presidential election, Republican candidates vied with each other over the number of bombs they wanted to rain down on Tehran in what seemed little more than crude war lust. America's drone operators continue to massacre far more Muslims than any Sunni atrocity. So perhaps realpolitik has at last come to the aid of a respect for the integrity and sovereignty of foreign states. For these blessings we must give thanks. The Turkish government has stepped up efforts to free 49 Turkish citizens, including senior diplomats, seized by Isis insurgents in Mosul last Wednesday, writes Constanze Letsch from Istanbul. According to Turkish media reports, the hostages that include Turkish Consul General in Mosul, \u00d6zt\u00fcrk Yildirim, are being held captive in an undisclosed location in northern Iraq. The government\u2019s Iraq Crisis Desk, established by the foreign ministry last Friday, issued a statement saying that efforts to achieve the release of the kidnapped citizens were being \u201ccarried out with great care\u201d. Deputy foreign minister Naci Koru told the Turkish press that the 49 consulate staff were \u201cin good health\u201d. He also dismissed reports that Isis fighters had demanded ransom for the held Turkish citizens. He added that the Turkish foreign ministry had urged Turkish citizens in Iraq to be extremely careful. Kuru said: \u201cAt this point Baghdad is a zone of risk. Parts of the city\u2019s environs are under the control of Isis. We are warning citizens to leave at the slightest sign of danger. Baghdad is not in the hands of terrorist organisations, but there is a danger, a risk.\u201d According to the foreign ministry website, 7,000 \u2013 10,000 Turkish citizens are thought to currently reside in Iraq in addition to the 110,000 Turkish citizens that live in the Kurdistan regional government (KRG) region. It said cheap flights were available to Turkish citizens who wished to leave the neighbouring country. In reference to Isis attack on the predominantly Turkmen town of Tel Afar on Sunday night, Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned of a \u201csectarian war\u201d. He also urged the press to follow the Mosul hostage crisis silently: \u201cAbout 100 of our citizens are in the hands of Isis elements\u201d, he said speaking at a rally in the Black Sea town of Trabzon on Sunday. \u201cWe want you [the media] to follow these events not with provocations, but without writing, drawing and talking too much about them. These provocations have negative consequences.\u201d The prime minister also announced that his government would hold another urgent meeting after his return to the capital Ankara. \u201cWe will decide what further steps will be taken then\u201d, Erdo\u011fan said. Britain is only prepared to offer \"technical\" help to the Iraqi government in its fight against Isis insurgents, according to the defence secretary Philip Hammond. PA reports: Speaking at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the Government was \"principally concerned\" with averting a humanitarian crisis in Iraq and ensuring stability in the country. Asked whether ruling out British military intervention may encourage Isis, Hammond replied: \"No, I don't think so. We are going to give all the support we can to the Iraqi government, technical support and advice. \"But the Foreign Secretary has made it clear we don't have any intention of putting British boots on the ground. \"This is an Iraqi problem and has to be solved in Iraq. But we'll provide all the assistance we can from a technical standpoint.\" He added: \"We are principally concerned to make sure there is stability in the country, that a legitimately elected government is able to govern the country, and to avert a humanitarian crisis as hundreds of thousands of Iraqis are displaced from their homes.\" Hammond said blaming a lack of action in Syria for the extremist insurgency in Iraq was \"probably a rather simplistic analysis\". The 2003 invasion was \"certainly one of the factors\", he added. \"I think the root causes of the problems in Iraq are very complex and deep-rooted,\" Hammond said. \"There are multiple causes of the situation. What's important now is that we persuade the leaders of Iraq to be prepared to compromise, to be prepared to act, to be inclusive so that we get a coming together of the different groups in Iraq in order to save that country's integrity.\" Washington needs to accept Tehran as an essential player in containing and rolling back Isis, according to Middle East analysts and specialist Iran watchers Flynt Leverett and Hillary Mann Leverett. Writing in the National Interest they says: It is crucial, though, that America engage Iran over Isis politically\u2014not, as some suggest, by U.S. warplanes covering Iranian foot soldiers in Iraq. (Most responsible officials and politicians in Tehran appear too smart to fall for such a \u201ctrap,\u201d which would also play into al-Qa\u2019ida\u2019s grand strategy.) Iranian officials are due to enter talks on its nuclear programme with world powers, including the US, in Vienna today. There is a widespread expectation that the talks will be used to discuss possible US-Iran cooperation in Iraq. US Deputy Secretary of State William Burns, who held secret nuclear talks with Iran in 2013, was due in Vienna, as was Iraian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, AFP reports. Reuters point out that Iran's president Hassan Rouhani, has not ruled out working with the US against Isis in Iraq. Speaking at a news confernce on Saturday he said: We can think about it, if we see America starts confonting the terrorist groups in Iraq or elsewhere. Where did Isis come from? Who is funding this terrorist group? We had warned everyone, including the West, about the danger of backing such a terrorist and reckless group. AFP has more confirmation about the fall of Tal Afar. Security forces insisted they had repelled an assault on Tal Afar, a Shia Turkman-majority town in Nineveh province, but multiple officials and a resident said militants had entered it, with one saying they were in control. \"Armed groups managed to take control of Tal Afar,\" a Nineveh provincial government official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"They clashed with security forces and (tribal fighters), who had to withdraw from the town.\" Martin Chulov in Baghdad said the fall of Tal Afar was of limited significance. The main battle lines are between Baquba and Baghdad, and to the west of the city around Anbar. The north of the country and the centre has, by and large, been taken by Isis. If they take another town or village in the centre it is not going to change anything. If they are going to advance on Baghdad, that's a different story. But I still don't see that happening. They [Isis] are a classic insurgent group, they are very capable, extremely dangerous. But to storm a city like Baghdad, which would be heavily defended by what remains of Maliki's military and irregulars is a very different matter. Claims that 1,700 Iraqi troops have been summarily executed by insurgents is of \u201cextremely potent propaganda value\u201d for Isis, but they remains unverified, Martin Chulov in Baghdad points out. In an audio update from the Iraqi capital Martin said it was confirmed that around 80 soldiers had been killed, but the fate of up to 1,900 missing soldiers was unclear. Images of the killings is having an incendiary effect, he warned. These photos depicting widespread slaughter, and accompanying videos, are genuine, they are galvanising a deeply outraged belligerent Shia community in Baghdad. These are extremely dangerous images in such combustible times, and there are urgent efforts to try and establish what\u2019s happened to the rest of the 1,900 odd Shia soldiers who were captured by Isis last Wednesday. Are they in custody in Tikrit where they were taken? Or have they been killed? If its the latter that it is going to cause an even further rapid deterioration in this situation. On the claim that 1,700 troops have been killed, Martin added: It is not easy to hide 1,700 bodies ... I would have thought there would have been leverage in keeping those prisoners alive, rather than whole sale slaughter which they know is going to send every Shia in the land after them. My suspicion is that they remain alive but in desperate peril. Martin said the fight back against Isis has begun in earnest, but it is battle being motivated by sectarianism rather than nationalism. The recruitment centres in Baghdad are literally over flowing with young lads wanting to join up an fight, along sectarian lines. It doesn\u2019t appear to be nationalistic cause at this point. The orientation towards sect is taking primacy over orientation to being a patriotic Iraqi. More on the fall of Tal Afar, from AP. Tal Afar Mayor Abdulal Abdoul said that his town, 260 miles northwest of Baghdad, was taken just before dawn. The town has a population of some 200,000 people, mostly ethnic Shia and Sunni Turkomen. The ethnic mix of Tal Afar raises the grim specter of large-scale atrocities by the Sunni militants, who already claim to have killed hundreds of Shiites in areas they captured last week. Tal Afar residents reached by phone confirmed the town's capture by militants. They spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing for their safety. The fall of Tal Afar comes a week after militants of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant [Isis] captured Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, and Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit in a lightening offensive. William Hague has again ruled out military intervention in Iraq, but he revealed that Britain is considering some form of counter-terrorism operation. The foreign secretary is due to make a statement to the Commons later today. Speaking to the Today programme ahead of the announcement he said: \"We might be able to help with counter terrorism ... I don't want to go into the details because that makes it more difficult to operate.\" He mentioned \"counter terrorism expertise\" before being interrupted. But Hague added: \u201cAre we looking at a British military intervention? No, we\u2019re not. I can\u2019t be clearer than that.\u201d Hague also insisted he backed the invasion of Iraq, but admitted mistakes were made. \"I don\u2019t think the invasion itself was a mistake. I have always thought that many mistakes were made in the aftermath of the invasion,\" he said. There are reports that Sunni insurgents have seized control of Tal Afar. Earlier Iraqi officials told AFP that security forces and tribal fighters had repelled a militant assault on Tal Afar. It describes the town as important strategicly as it provides a critical corridor for militants to access Syria. Like Tony Blair, Paul Bremer the US diplomat who led the occupation authority in Iraq, remains unrepentant about the invasion. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme he said: The big error was leaving too soon. I argued 10 years ago that I thought history would judge not that we stayed too long but that we left too early. I think events of the last few weeks tend towards that view. Bremer also claimed that without the invasion, the US would be facing a nuclear armed Iraq and a continuation of Saddam Hussein's \"murderous policy towards the Iraqi people\". And Bremer called for a return of some US intelligence forces to Iraq to help repel the advance of Isis. On the possibility of co-operating with Iran, Bremer said: At bottom we do have a shared interest in a stable and united Iraq. If we don't intervene and if the Isis moves around Baghdad into the holy cities, the Iranians would see an opportunity and perhaps even a need to intervene directly. So we may get backed into a situation where we are in effect working with the Iranians. The Wall Street Journal has more detail on its claim that the US is preparing to discuss some form of joint action in Iraq with its one-time arch foe Iran. It quotes a US defence official saying: This is a case where the enemy of our enemy is still our enemy. Any shared interests in Iraq are limited. The paper adds: The White House's engagement with Iran on Iraq offers both opportunities and risks, said US defence officials and Arab diplomats. Iran, a majority Shiite country, has served as Maliki's closest Mideast ally and has mobilized Tehran's military and religious establishment to support their coreligionists in Iraq in recent days. Iran's elite military unit, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, has an extensive presence inside Iraq, said US officials, and has trained Shiamilitias that have joined the Iraqi army in fighting Isis. US officials say the IRGC trained many of the largest Shia militias going back to the Iraq war and maintain contacts. These include the Mahdi Army, Kata'ib Hezbollah, and Asab Ahl al-Haq. Iran has publicly denied sending forces to fight in Iraq and has said it would give Iran military assistance if Iraq asked. Even some of Obama's harshest critics in Washington voiced support on Sunday for coordinating the US.'s military response in Iraq with Tehran's. They argued that Isis poses a much greater near-term threat to the US's national-security interests than does Iran. \"Why did we deal with Stalin? Because he was not as bad as Hitler,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said Sunday on CNN. \"The Iranians can provide some assets to make sure Baghdad doesn't fall.\" On Sunday's Iran's president Hassan Rouhani said Tehran is ready to help the Baghdad government. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says Iran is ready to help the Iraqi government and nation, within the framework of international law, if Baghdad asks for help. The Tehran Times quoted him saying: We, as the Islamic Republic of Iran, are both friends and neighbours of Iraq, and our ties with the Iraqi government are close and cordial. If the Iraqi government asks for our help, we will review [the request], though we have not received such a request so far. Welcome to our continuing coverage of the crisis in Iraq. Here's a summary of the latest developments: The United States is reported to be preparing to open a direct dialogue with Iran about how to deal with the Sunni insurgency in Iraq, A senior official said the US was considering engaging with its longtime adversary about Iraq, where the government of prime minister Nouri al-Maliki is struggling to repel a militants who have seized several cities.
