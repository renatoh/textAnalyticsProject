Murray, the top seed, is defending the title and now meets Spain's Fernando Verdasco, whom he beat in last year's final. Murray has won all their three previous meetings but he will be more than a little tired, although he insisted on Thursday that he was feeling perfectly fresh. \"It was a tough win, but I tried to keep myself concentrated, played every ball up to the end and it worked,\" he said after yesterday's match. The first set against Tipsarevic lasted longer than his previous win over Latvia's Ernests Gulbis. The Scot accelerated into a 4-1 lead but the Serb, ranked No48, levelled at 4-4. Murray has an excellent tie-break record this season and although Tipsarevic once again dug in, pulling back a 3-0 deficit to 5-5, Murray's resolve never wavered. It seemed he finally had the Serb on the ropes when he broke him for a 2-1 second-set lead, only for Tipsarevic to hit back immediately. Under increasing pressure Murray held his serve to save the set at 5-5 and then struck the killer blow, winning the last two games. He revealed he had achieved his goals for the year: \"I wanted to try and get into Shanghai this year and finish in the top 10. Last year I missed three months with a wrist injury and I was one win away from getting into the Masters Cup. I lost to Richard Gasquet in Paris so it was quite tough for me but this year I qualified with quite a few tournaments to go and I'm guaranteed to finish fourth in the world, so it's been a very good year.\" The Scot believes his improved physical conditioning is a key factor behind his success. However, he knows he has much to do if he is to catch Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, who occupy the three places ahead of him in the rankings. \"As the No4 I'm still quite far ahead of the guys in fifth, sixth and seventh but I'm quite far behind Djokovic in third so I need to keep this form up. I need to try and finish the year well and start 2009 well. \"The only goal I have left for myself is to win a grand slam.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
