Fascinating on disc, in the concert hall it proved a little underwhelming. Of course, nobody was expecting Bostridge to slog through the CD's 15 demanding arias back to back, but including only six in the main programme seemed like slightly short measure. These were padded out with instrumental overtures and suites; minute for minuet, we heard more of the ensemble Europa Galante alone than we did of Bostridge. Still, thanks to the imagination of Fabio Biondi, directing from the violin, their Telemann, Vivaldi and Handel were far from mere fillers, and the seething energy built up during the many-layered finale of Corelli's Concerto Grosso Op 6 No 4 deserved the audience whoop. Bostridge began with an aria from Caldara's opera Gioaz, an angular piece expressing anxiety that sounded just a little too convincing. In this opening number and the next \u2013 an aria from Vivaldi's Arsilda full of characteristically crunchy harmonies \u2013 there were some uncharacteristic wobbles in tuning. Then things settled down, and Bostridge's own virtuosity shone in music written for three very different virtuosos. In an aria from Boyce's Solomon, a mellow bassoon joined the strings in a murmuring evocation of a gentle breeze that lovingly cushioned Bostridge's airy melody. Handel's Scorta Siate a Passi Miei, written for a version of Giulio Cesare in which tenor Francesco Borosini sang Sesto, was dispatched in showstopping style. For the most substantial aria, and the one in which Bostridge seemed most at ease, we had to wait until the encores. Scherza Infida from Handel's Ariodante was not written for a tenor and was thus, strictly speaking, a gatecrasher. It was, however, the evening's highlight, suggesting the castratos got the best tunes after all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
