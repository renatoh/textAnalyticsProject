The trouble is that when it comes to awarding training contracts, supply exceeds demand and the big law firms can afford the luxury of being choosy. Addleshaw Booth &amp; Co, one of the UK's leading commercial law firms, takes on around 40 graduates each year and expects at least a 2:1. Michael Birchall, the firms's partner in charge of graduate recruitment, says AB&amp;C also considers applicants' A level grades. \"The selection process gets underway in the second year of the degree course, when we begin our trawl to recruit the brightest and best based on their yearly results and projections of their final grades,\" he says. The firm seeks out trainees who are well-rounded as well as strong academically. \"We welcome applications from both law and non-law graduates, as well as mature students considering a change of direction,\" says Michael. Unusually, the firm hires at least 50% of its interns from graduates with degrees in other subjects who are prepared to undertake a postgraduate conversion course. The firm has 118 partners and a total staff of almost 1,200 people. Its client portfolio includes101 financial institutions and 90 public-sector organisations. J Sainsbury, BT, AstraZeneca and Royal &amp; SunAlliance are among its biggest clients. \"The firm has an excellent reputation within the industry and is rated very highly by the trade press,\" says Michael Potter, who joined the firm after completing a law degree at Nottingham. \"The size of the firm appealed to me. I didn't want to join one of the so-called 'magic circle' firms as I already knew from people working there that you could easily remain anonymous. \"Addleshaw Booth is small enough to provide real early responsibility, yet large enough to retain an impressive portfolio of high-profile clients. And there is tremendous variety here. There are opportunities to move between the firm's Leeds, London and Manchester offices.\" During training, new recruits share an office with a qualified solicitor or partner trained to ensure that they are receiving the best possible experience. They also work as part of a team to develop the necessary professional skills. The training is complemented by a series of training courses provided by AB&amp;C's in-house team and the College of Law. The firm also runs a summer work experience scheme for law students in their second or final year. \u00b7 For details of application procedures along with its graduate recruitment brochure, contact Mrs Simran Foote, Graduate Manager, 100 Barbirolli Square, Manchester, M2 3AB."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
