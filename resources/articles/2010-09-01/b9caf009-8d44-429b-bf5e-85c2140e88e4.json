What is the problem you British have with learning the languages of your European neighbours? Why is this area being singled out for the first, biggest, fastest cuts? As German-language writers and poets, our particular concern is for the university's Centre for Contemporary German Literature. Founded in 1993, it has greatly increased awareness in the English-speaking world of the work of many living German writers. The studies published by Swansea academics have had international impact \u2013 even in Germany and Austria. Swansea is a flagship centre for German-British cultural understanding. Reducing the number of staff in German by half will put this excellent institution at risk.
