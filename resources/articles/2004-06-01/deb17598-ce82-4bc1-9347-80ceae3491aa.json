But not Mary J. The self-proclaimed queen of hip hop soul wants us to know that it is all about positivity. After taming addictions to coke and alcohol, and extricating herself from abusive relationships, the once difficult Yonkers diva found God and self-respect. She crowed about it at length on last year's self-absorbed and critically panned Love and Life . But her return to the UK after two years serves to remind us why she is one of the most distinctive vocalists of her generation. Dressed down in jeans, with brassy blonde hair and a stomach-skinning black top, Blige takes the stage to the ecstatic wails of an appreciative audience. Accompanied by a bevy of attractive dancers, she reels through tracks at a heart- quickening pace before pulling up a gilded chair to evoke the emotional trauma of her past life. Soaring ballads such as 'Child of the Ghetto' are interspersed with snappy sermons on the importance of 'loving yourself'. It is wearyingly inevitable, but everyone loves a battler and in person her unaffected demeanour gives leeway. Dancers acting out scenes of domestic violence while fans blithely waved their hands in the air, was embarrassingly misconceived, however. Inevitably, it is Blige's soulful voice, used to intimate effect in the cavernous hangar during the thigh-quakingly rousing 'No More Dramas' and closer 'Family Affair', that truly lifts spirits."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
