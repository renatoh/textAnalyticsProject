Scuffles broke out following Brazil's victory over Uruguay in a penalty shoot-out after the match ended in a 2-2 draw. Brazil were on the point of going out when Fernando's penalty miss left Uruguay's Pablo Garc\u00eda needing to score to win the match. But Garc\u00eda hit the post and Brazil won the shoot-out 5-4. During the match itself, Brazil twice led but Uruguay fought back each time. The Arsenal and Brazil midfielder Gilberto Silva will miss the final after picking up a second booking. While the Uruguay coach, Oscar Tab\u00e1rez, and his players left without commenting, the Brazil coach, Dunga, praised his players' courage: \"To be a winning team, you have to know how to suffer. In the most difficult moment, you have to have posture, courage and fight until the end. I want to thank the players because they left their families behind to come here. They have shown great love for the shirt of Brazil. All this has been after a long season in Europe.\" Brazil will meet the winners of the overnight semi-final between Mexico and Argentina in Sunday's final."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
