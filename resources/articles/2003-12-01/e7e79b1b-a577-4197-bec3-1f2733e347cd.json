Dineen, best known for her Labour party political broadcast on Tony Blair and her examination of ex-Spice Girl Geri Halliwell, pointed the finger at the obsession of commissioning editors with high-rating reality TV shows such as Channel 4's Wife Swap. \"If you are up against a lot of reality TV - which is definitely very juicy - it's very difficult for commissioners to feel secure about a more straight documentary,\" she said. \"Documentaries now have got to be sexier and faster, or pacier and sillier - or more people have to be humiliated,\" said Dineen, who is know for her intimate and painstaking portraits of British institutions and individuals. \"Why do they think we are morons? I think it's patronising to audiences to think that they can't be bothered to watch [documentaries].\" Dineen, who most recently made C4's The Lord's Tale about the passing of 700 hereditary peers and who picked up the prestigious Trustees' Award at the Grierson Documentary Awards last month, said broadcasters are now much less receptive to ideas from filmmakers than they used to be. \"It's a huge problem in broadcast. I know that BBC4 puts out lots and lots of fantastic documentaries, but it's almost impossible for documentary makers to go in [with an idea] and say 'I'd like to do this'.\" Dineen, who started her career making films on subjects such as the Angel tube station for BBC2 documentary strand 40 Minutes, added that broadcasters' reluctance to take on new filmmakers made it tougher for new faces to get a break. \"I've been very lucky because I made a name for myself when there was a feeling that talent would be nurtured. Nowadays it's really, really scary. I think one or two people would get taken on [today].\" Speaking on Radio Five Live, Dineen singled out BBC4 documentary strand Storyville - run by editor Nick Fraser - as one of the only places in the schedules where new ideas could find a home. \"It's as if the individuality... and power of the filmmaker have gone, and it's more about corporate ideas and putting people in human experiments and making a sort of entertaining, reality television. But it's not documentary,\" she said. Dineen blamed the demise of the serious documentary on increasing competitiveness in TV - with documentaries being perceived as weak points in the schedule. She added that TV and newspapers were largely responsible for the dominance of films about celebrities over other topics. \"It's gone far too far and the media - TV and newspapers - are hugely responsible for that.\" Dineen said she was interested in making her next film about the media itself. \"If I was brave enough, that's the film I'd like to make.\" But she added it would be \"more or less impossible\" to get the right access. \"You couldn't get a programme controller to really sit and talk to you about what they do and why. And I'm not sure you'd be allowed to film programme planning meetings.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
