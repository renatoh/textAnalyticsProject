I'm not sure about the number five but it was a useful team and it was the first time in the series that we had our best side out,\" he said. \"I think our middle-order batting has been very disappointing in this series, though I did like the look of Jonathan Trott when I saw him on TV.\" Only twice, in 1926 and 1953, have England won the Ashes in the final Test at The Oval, going into the match all-square in the series, and for Graveney, now 82, that last occasion 56 years ago ranks as one of his career highlights. \"I don't remember it for personal reasons, because I didn't have a particularly good match [out for four in his one innings]. In fact I only scraped into the side because I'd made a 50 playing against Lindwall, Miller, Archer and Davidson on a green wicket at Headingley. \"But I do remember everyone being keyed up and excited before the game and the whole crowd coming onto the field when we won. Then it was back to play for Gloucestershire the following day. \"We had started the series with only four bowlers and with Peter May batting at six, which wasn't right. And Freddie Brown, who was a selector, played at Lord's. \"Mind you, we almost won that first game in Nottingham. Alec Bedser took 14 wickets and we only wanted about 230 to win, and were 120 for one. But there was a lot of rain. In fact there was a lot of rain in the series. \"The second Test at Lord's is probably best remembered for that match-saving partnership between Willie Watson and Trevor Bailey and we almost beat them at Old Trafford, where we had them 35 for eight. \"I remember Bailey stopping them winning at Headingley by bowling down the leg-side. Then we won by eight wickets at The Oval after Laker and Lock bowled them out.\" In 1926, as in 1953, the first four matches were drawn. England recalled Harold Larwod, who on the recommendation of Jack Hobbs had made his debut earlier in the series. They also recalled the 48-year-old Wilfred Rhodes. Both Larwood and Rhodes were central figures in the match, each taking six wickets as England won by 289 runs. There is a lesson here, surely, for selectors, who bang on about the importance of the continuity of selection. And it is that a piece of controlled panic might be the answer when there is a match that must be won."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
