A toga. I'd lost regular employment as a cartoon animator, so some friends who were doing crowd work on films told me to come and join them on a film called Caesar and Cleopatra. I was dressed up in a toga, given a spear and gold sandals, and stood with 2,000 others. Later, the director approached me, and asked whether I would consider training to be an actor. Who or what have you sacrificed for your art? Sometimes I've had to put myself on a diet. For Bond, I had to lose at least a stone or two. It was quite painful. Since playing James Bond, has it been difficult to avoid being typecast? When I was doing Bond, I was always being sent scripts to play the derring-do hero, with explosions going on all around. It's different now, though: they just look at me and say, \"Poor old thing \u2013 can't get out of a chair.\" You work for a number of charities, including Unicef and Peta. Is it important for artists to champion charitable causes? We all have a responsibility in life to do what we can to help those less fortunate. Audrey Hepburn originally asked me to get involved with Unicef. She was my neighbour in Switzerland; at the first press conference we did together, everyone only wanted to ask us about movies, but she wouldn't let them. She'd turn every question back to the problems facing the world's children. Which role are you most proud of? A film I made in the late 60s called The Man Who Haunted Himself. I played both myself and my doppelganger. It was a film I actually got to act in, rather than just being all white teeth and flippant and heroic. What's the worst thing anyone ever said about you? You only remember the bad notices, but there were no good ones to remember. I did a film called Diane with Lana Turner; a review said, \"Lana came onto the screen with a clattering of high heels and a fluttering of false eyelashes, followed by a lump of English roast beef.\" Another review said of one of the Bond films that I looked like a \"floor-walker who had been to Switzerland three times for a facelift\". You've got to laugh. How would you like to be remembered? As somebody who never walked past a beggar. Which other artists do you admire? Every musician I've ever met. Learning a play is one thing, but to learn to play Vivaldi's Four Seasons without music: that's brilliant. What one song would work as the soundtrack to your life? Land of Hope and Glory. All I've had is hope, and a little glory. In short Born: London, 1927. Career: Best known for being the longest-serving incarnation of James Bond. Other films and TV include The Persuaders!, The Saint, and A Christmas Princess, out now on DVD. High point: \"Working with No\u00ebl Coward in New York. He was hysterically funny.\" Low point: \"Becoming 58, and too old to go on playing Bond.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
