Two days after admitting he has funds to make only loan signings this month, it was strange that Arsenal\u2019s manager found no place in his squad for a player with two and a half years left on a contract worth \u00a3350,000 a week. Emery was asked if it represented a luxury to leave out his highest earner on tactical grounds, especially as his bench contained few attacking options. Yet his response only served to underline how far the German has fallen down the pecking order since Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s departure at the end of last season. \u201cFor me he is like another player,\u201d Emery said. \u201cIt\u2019s one decision, when one player is coming or not coming. Sometimes he is helping us, at other moments he is not helping us because of his injury or because maybe the match is not for him. But he is a good player.\u201d \u00d6zil, who has not played since being withdrawn at half-time in the 1-1 draw with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on Boxing Day, returned to training last week after shaking off a knee injury. Yet it has become clear that Emery does not trust him to work hard enough away from home. \u00d6zil tweeted a picture of himself in training on Friday afternoon, the same day he was told of his omission against West Ham. \u201cLike the other players,\u201d Emery said. \u201cWhen we did the squad.\u201d Arsenal, who host Chelsea on Saturday evening, have picked up two points from their last five away games. \u201cIt\u2019s our challenge,\u201d Emery said. \u201cEach match is our challenge away. We are working on that. \u201cWe need to take more confidence, more performance collectively, being competitive away to change this moment. We started the season away well, being competitive and winning. But we need to do more to be more competitive and to impose our idea and our quality.\u201d West Ham, meanwhile, are in talks to sell the midfielder Pedro Obiang to Fiorentina."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
