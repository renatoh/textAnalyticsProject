Nine years ago we planted a wisteria and trained it across the frontage. Every year since then we have had wonderful flowering, mostly twice a year. It has been pruned regularly. Last year it flowered as usual, but it had not put on any new growth. After flowering, the leaves curled up and became crisp, and following a rain storm the leaves washed off. We fed and watered it, but it currently shows no sign of life, no buds or growth. Why do you think this happened? Ian Morrison A My brother's did the same last year and I think I identified it as Verticillium wilt. Some plants are strong enough to grow out of it, but your situation doesn't bode well as it sounds like it didn't re-set leaf later in the summer. Leave it until the end of the month to see if it comes back from the base. If it does, give it another go. If it doesn't, I'd be tempted to replace it with a new plant in a different position. Q A friend gave me his lilac tree four years ago. After initial neglect, I planted it in a large (2.5ft sq) planter. Since then it has put out new growth, but I have never seen flowers on it. I live in Paris and the terrace is northwest-facing. Meg A It may be that it has yet to fill out the pot and is putting on extension growth because it doesn't 'need' to flower, but I must say that usually the best flowering lilacs are found in a sunnier position. Plant annuals around the base to keep you happy meantime, and your patience may be rewarded. \u00b7 If you have a gardening question for Dan, email ask.dan@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
