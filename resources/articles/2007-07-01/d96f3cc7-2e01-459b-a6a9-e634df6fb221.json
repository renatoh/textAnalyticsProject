Though J\u00fcrgen Grobler's top crew preserved their unbeaten record by beating Slovenia and moving into tomorrow's semi-finals, the manner of their victory suggests that their main opponents from Holland and New Zealand may scent an upset. Normally the British team's flagship boat has no trouble dispatching the fast-starting Slovenian crew, who are not as strong in the last quarter. Though they had the lead yesterday, the British crew looked out of their comfort zone as they finished 1.5sec ahead of Slovenia. Grobler will expect his crew to improve with the undoubted talents of Tom James, who is covering for Alex Partridge while he recovers from a hamstring injury. David Tanner, the performance director, said: \"The four were fine but, if you look at the splits of the other boats from New Zealand and Holland, it looks like there will be some close racing.\" However, the men's double of Steve Rowbotham and Matt Wells, who missed Henley last week through injury, won well from New Zealand and showed that they have kept the speed and the class which enabled them to take gold and silver in the past two World Cup events. The same was true of the British women's quadruple scull, who missed Henley after their shock defeat by China in Amsterdam last month. The Chinese are not racing here but Britain's world champions comfortably headed Romania. Sir Steve Redgrave, five times an Olympic champion, made in an impressive return to competition yesterday when his Veteran \"C\" four comfortably won their heat at the Henley Veterans Regatta, beating Abingdon. \"It's good to be back,\" the 45-year-old Redgrave said later."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
