As the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, prepared to give a statement on Hong Kong on Monday, in which he is expected to suspend extradition arrangements with the territory, Liu Xiaoming flatly denied claims of abuses by Beijing. Human rights groups and western governments have catalogued systematic attacks on the Muslim Uighur minority in China\u2019s western region, including mass forced sterilisation and detainment in \u201cre-education\u201d camps. Drone footage of hundreds of blindfolded and shackled men, who appeared to be Uighur and other minority ethnic groups, being led from a train in what was believed to be a transfer of inmates in Xinjiang last August. Shown the pictures during a combative interview by the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr, Liu said: \u201cI do not know where you get this videotape,\u201d adding, \u201csometimes you have a transfer of prisoners, in any country.\u201d \u201cUighur people enjoy peaceful, harmonious coexistence with other ethnic groups of people,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe treat every ethnic group as equal.\u201d The video, which was posted anonymously online last year, has resurfaced recently and gone viral online amid new allegations and reports of forced sterilisation and other abuses against Uighur detainees. China has come under fire for the mass detention of detainees in Xinjiang in both the formal prison system as well as internment camps that serve as de facto prisons, which Beijing claims are merely vocational training centres. As well as the drone footage, Liu was played an interview with a woman who said she had been subjected to forced sterilisation. He responded by blaming such reports on \u201csome small group of anti-China elements\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s no, so-called, pervasive, massive, forced sterilisation among Uighur women in China,\u201d he said. But he conceded: \u201cI cannot rule out single cases. For any country, there\u2019s single cases.\u201d Liu also defended the new security law recently passed in Hong Kong, which has facilitated a draconian crackdown on anti-government protests. He said ensuring national security is the responsibility of every government, and Beijing had been forced to act because Hong Kong law had \u201cfailed to curtail, to contain this violence, looting, smashing\u201d. China\u2019s human rights record in Xinjiang has provoked growing international condemnation. Earlier this month, the US imposed sanctions on Chinese officials in protest at the treatment of the Uighurs and other minority groups, including Kazakhs. The UK shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, interviewed by the BBC after Liu, said it appeared China was engaged in genocide. \u201cIt certainly looks that way,\u201d she said, describing China\u2019s actions as \u201cthe deliberate persecution and killing of a large group of people on the basis of their ethnicity of nationhood\u201d. She urged the UK government to echo the US\u2019s approach, and impose unilateral sanctions. Raab said he would announce the result of a review of extradition arrangements with Hong Kong on Monday, amid mounting concern over the situation. The UK has already promised that up to 3 million Hong Kong residents will be offered the chance to settle in the UK, and a path to permanent citizenship. Raab said: \u201cI\u2019m going to go to the House of Commons tomorrow to make a further statement on the work we\u2019ve been doing with our partners in government. I\u2019ve said that we\u2019d review a whole range of other considerations. One of the things that we reviewed is our extradition arrangements and I will be updating the house on the conclusion of that review, along with other things that we\u2019ve been looking at, tomorrow,\u201d he said, interviewed on Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News. However, in what appeared to be a hint that the UK is not preparing to impose unilateral sanctions on China as the US has done, he said, \u201cwe have said there won\u2019t be business as usual after Covid-19 and we are working with our international partners to get a proper independent review of what happened but we also want to make sure that we\u2019re not slipping into some outdated dogmatic approach.\u201d Liu said China would make a \u201cresolute response\u201d to any sanctions. It has already imposed travel bans on US officials in retaliation for the sanctions. China will be high on the agenda when Raab meets his US counterpart, Mike Pompeo, in London this week. As well as flatly denying the persecution of the Uighur, Liu expressed anger at Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to exclude Huawei from the UK\u2019s 5G network by the end of 2027, suggesting it showed London was \u201cdancing to the tune\u201d of Washington. \u201cWe are still evaluating the consequences. This is a very bad decision,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
