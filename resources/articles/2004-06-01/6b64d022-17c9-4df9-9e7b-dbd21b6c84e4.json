In view of this result it ought never to have been disinterred. This was more than just another messy England friendly. Lasting unease arises from the sight of the manager unsettling his own team with the sudden decision that Frank Lampard should be an improbable linchpin in midfield. This, it ought to be remembered, was meant to be the line-up that would confront France in Lisbon on June 13. Ecstatic though he professed himself to be over the opening 30 minutes, all Eriksson took from the night were second thoughts. After Lampard's direct opponent Shunsuke Nakamura had dominated the contest, the Chelsea midfielder eventually made way for Nicky Butt. A sheepish Eriksson may decide that the Manchester United man should not be sidelined again. Whatever happens, uncertainty has been introduced to a midfield which was eventually fragmented here. Lampard himself is much too good to be a scapegoat and it is the manager who will be reproached. He himself had commented that the whole balance of a team can be thrown out of kilter if the area in front of the defence is not policed satisfactorily. Eriksson could have done without seeing the wisdom of those words borne out vividly. You could only wonder how ring-rusty Butt must have been on the training ground at Sardinia, after a year of virtual disuse with his club, to plant doubts in the mind of a manager whose faith in him is dogged. It was a puzzle, too, to determine why Phil Neville or Owen Hargreaves did not take over his duties if an alteration was essential. There is no rancour about involving Lampard, who vies with Steven Gerrard as the best English midfielder of the season. He established that reputation with goals and bold running for Chelsea, however, and such instincts have to be disowned by anyone on guard duty. At Japan's equaliser he was stranded near the halfway line. When Eriksson remarked, a couple of weeks ago, that Lampard was intelligent enough to adapt to a change of roles it sounded like a platitude. The manager was wholly in earnest, ready to put that assessment to the test at Euro 2004. First, however, Lampard had to acquit himself well against these opponents. It was an exacting assignment. Japan were deft when beating a rudimentary Iceland side at the start of this mini-tournament and Nakamura, of the Italian club Reggina, set tough questions for Lampard after Michael Owen had put England ahead. He may be no Zin\u00e9dine Zidane, the emblem of French grace whom Eriksson's team will encounter at the start of Euro 2004, but Nakamura sidled into space behind the attack for shots twice around the half-hour mark, with David James impressing by getting down low to his right to push away the first of them. It had taken the jolt of England's opener to rouse the visitors and convert this into an instructive game. Eriksson could only be happy with the freshness of the side's initial efforts. He sought to attribute the waning performance thereafter to the taxing effects of a tough training routine, and weariness should not be an excuse in Portugal. Despite knocks to David Beckham, Gary Neville and John Terry, there are not expected to be any withdrawals from the Euro 2004 squad that has to be confirmed today. Eriksson claimed he could hardly recall better attacking than he saw from England at the outset, and, though that is an extreme claim, the team were eager and forceful. A fifth-minute header by Terry was knocked off the goal-line by Shinji Ono. England were vibrant, with a Gary Neville surge drawing a foul by Alessandro Santos after 16 minutes. The Beckham set piece broke to Lampard and a purposeful shot was blocked by Junichi Inamoto. Japan were became disorientated and Keisuke Tsuboi headed weakly into the path of Gerrard. His low effort bobbled but that scarcely excused Seigo Narazaki, the goalkeeper, who let the ball bounce off his chest. Owen, alert as ever, pounced to score for his country for the 25th time. It did Japan far more good than England. They were inventive for the rest of the half and deserved the penalty denied them by the Italian referee Roberto Rosetti in the 43rd minute. Santos twisted away from Terry and Paul Scholes made contact with the back of his legs inside the area. England had other matters to brood upon when Japan brought themselves level in the 53rd minute. Just before that, Eriksson's side had looked as if they were about to reassert themselves, with Gerrard's superb pass picking out a Lampard run which ended with him firing over from an angle. Japan were not to be quelled so easily and retained the composure for an immaculate goal. Nakamura slid the ball inside Gary Neville and the irrepressible Santos rolled the cut-back which Feyenoord's attacker Ono converted. The drive flew through James's legs but he was so unprotected that no blame could be attached. Substitutions are generally a blight in England fixtures, but the crowd ought to have welcomed the first of them here since they were made by the visitors. Any disruption of Japan was welcome even if they had brought it upon themselves. England (4-4-2): James; G Neville (P Neville, 85), Terry (King, 88), Campbell, A Cole; Beckham (J Cole, 81), Lampard (Butt, 81), Scholes (Dyer, 77), Gerrard (Hargreaves, 81); Rooney (Heskey, 77), Owen (Vassell, 77). Japan (3-4-3): Narazaki; Tsuboi, Miyamoto, Nakazawa; Kaji, Inamoto (Fukunishi, 90), Ono, Santos; Nakamura; Kubo (Suzuki, 60), Tamada (Yanagisawa, 60). Referee: R Rosetti (Italy). Pointers for Portugal Positives \u00b7 Steven Gerrard As the debate rages over the best English system there can be no doubt Gerrard could have as big an impact in Portugal as any other midfield player. \u00b7 Michael Owen You sense Owen could trouble the most accomplished defender in Euro 2004. \u00b7 Fitness England will be going into Euro 2004 without the usual host of injuries. Negatives \u00b7 Rio Ferdinand's absence As accomplished as John Terry and Sol Campbell were, without Ferdinand England lack pace in central defence. \u00b7 Nicky Butt's confidence After being displaced by Lampard, he has a badly bruised ego and will be a risk if required. \u00b7 Wayne Rooney He was one of England's more subdued performers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
