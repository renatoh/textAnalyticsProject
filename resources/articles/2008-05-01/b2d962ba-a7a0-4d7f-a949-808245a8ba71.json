The language wouldn't be out of place at the back of a football stand, and it's unusual for eastern Europeans. Swearing in English is almost meaningless nowadays, but when an eastern European swears, it is a danger sign - and you'd better pay attention. It is a very powerful and well-written play that clearly shows the social hardships both in Ukraine, and for immigrants to Britain. Craig Kelly, the actor playing Viktor, looks and sounds like a genuine Ukrainian. Everyone on stage has the correct eastern European accents, and the Ukrainian food looks just like the stuff you get to eat over there - the potato salads and the sausages. Viktor tries to fight the system from within, setting up his own labour company to bring more workers from eastern Europe and attempting to treat them fairly. But as the play evolves, he becomes corrupted and ends up exploiting his workforce. A certain amount of corruption is built into life in Ukraine - you need backhanders just to get things done, and the population is split between those who can play the money system and those that can't. The rule is that if you don't pay you don't get, and the play understands that. It's a human perspective on the battle between communism and capitalism. Viktor tries to play both systems, but eventually he becomes a person he never wanted to be. As one of the characters says, the chains have been removed - but are we really free? \u00b7 Interview by Paul Arendt \u00b7 Fast Labour is at the West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds, until Saturday.
