The Lyon forward is one of only two black players in Phil Neville\u2019s 28-member squad for the friendly in Germany next Tuesday and she believes it is \u201cunderstandable\u201d if young BAME girls feel underrepresented. When Parris entered the England setup at under-15 level a black head coach, Hope Powell, was leading a senior squad in which almost a quarter of the players were from BAME backgrounds. Parris and Manchester City\u2019s Demi Stokes are the only black players in Neville\u2019s latest selection. Rinsola Babajide of Liverpool was at the training camp in September but has not won a cap. \u201cIt is understandable,\u201d Parris said of the prospect that young BAME girls feel underrepresented. \u201cBut they do have role models in me and Demi. My role models were Rachel Yankey and Anita Asante, so there was, there has been and are players that play for England for people to look up to.\u201d The biggest barrier faced by BAME girls is a lack of access to sport in inner-city communities, said Parris. \u201cI do think that it is imperative that we do go inside these communities and really try hard to make sure it\u2019s accessible for young people to be able to play the sport. \u201cCentres of excellence are not actually situated in areas that are accessible for inner-city communities and the vast majority of BAME athletes or BAME participants are going to come from those areas. \u201cSo I do think that the FA do have to look at opportunities for girls to get into elite sport. Not just taking part in sessions, because I know the FA do support a lot of activities that help players get into the sport on a participation level, but I\u2019m talking about actually, if you believe that you\u2019re good enough to really be able kick on and be a future Lioness, having that elite support.\u201d Parris said she was lucky in having support from friends and family, and the good fortune to live near Mo Marley, then the Everton head coach who, with her husband Keith, \u201cpicked me up and took me to and from training, 45 minutes each way\u201d. The FA head of women\u2019s football, Baroness Sue Campbell, said tackling the issue of diversity was one of its \u201cbiggest challenges\u201d and was central to the governing body\u2019s new four-year strategy for the women\u2019s game. It includes a commitment to providing access to girls\u2019 football in every school and putting local leaders into communities to drive on women\u2019s football. \u201cIt\u2019s been a selective number of youngsters that have played our game,\u201d said Campbell. \u201cIf we get the new strategy right we\u2019ll have every girl, regardless of background, taking part in football. \u201cAnd the talent pathway has been too narrow, which means it\u2019s been exclusive as opposed to inclusive and accessible, which is what we\u2019re trying to change over the next four years. We have four pilot clubs that are helping us with that: Tottenham, Aston Villa, Manchester United and Durham. They are in areas where we hope to reach communities and groups that haven\u2019t reached in the past.\u201d The Manchester United forward Alessia Russo has withdrawn from the England squad through injury and been replaced by her clubmate Katie Zelem."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
