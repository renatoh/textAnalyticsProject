Roger Taylor, the team captain, is now totally dependent on Tim Henman being fit, the British No1 having been unable to practise since the US Open when the recurrence of an inflamed right shoulder left him struggling to reach the last 32 before being beaten in straight sets by Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina. Henman managed some light hitting with Taylor and the former British No1 Jeremy Bates yesterday at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena, the venue for the three-day tie, and he remains optimistic. Without him Britain stand lit tle hope of winning; even with him, but now without Rusedski, their chances are no more than 50-50. Rusedski's injury occurred at the US Open, although there were those who were quick to suggest it may have resulted from placing his foot in his mouth during the US Open. After losing to Pete Sampras in the third round, a match he might easily have won, the British No2 said the veteran American was \"a step and a half\" slower than before and was unlikely to win another match. Six days later Sampras beat Andre Agassi in the final. Rusedski's injury is apparently similar to the problem he suffered with his right foot three years ago which needed surgery and caused him to miss the 2000 Australian Open. Taylor, short of alternatives, called up Miles Maclagan to join Henman, Martin Lee and Arvind Parmar. Maclagan, ranked No12 in Britain, has officially retired as a singles player but may be used in Saturday's doubles. Thailand's leading player is Paradorn Srichaphan, who beat Agassi in the second round at Wimbledon this year but lost to Rusedski at Flushing Meadows; their No2, Danai Udomchoke, is ranked outside the top 200, lower than both Lee and Parmar. Henman's injury flared up on the North American hardcourt circuit before the US Open. He was obviously struggling at Flushing Meadows but, by his own admission, managed to \"bluff\" his way through his first two matches. Since returning to London he has received extensive daily treatment from Britain's Davis Cup physio, Mark Bender. In most instances, provided surgery is not needed, rest is the best cure for such an injury, so Henman, who has always made the Davis Cup a priority, is risking a further setback by playing this weekend. At stake are his chances of competing in the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai. Ideally Taylor would have liked to limit him to the doubles, or a singles match on Sunday if necessary. But with Rusedski pulling out he needs Henman, the world No5, from the start."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
