We're talking about the likes of Arthur Smith and John Hegley: performers who turn up year upon year, and always with something worth listening to. Simon Munnery's also in this group, thanks to a series of inventive one-man shows at The Stand that consistently push the boundaries. This year, Munnery's staging seven performances a day. As well as his main solo show, Hats Off To The 101ers, he'll be hosting a \"pop-up conceptual restaurant\" called La Concepta. Potential diners need to register online (at laconcepta.fr), then they'll be directed to a mystery location to await Munnery and his bag of tricks. Places are limited but for those who attend should expect one of the most creatively invigorating \"meals\" served anywhere on the fringe. Hats Off For The 101ers: Stand, 3.40pm, to 29 Aug My Name Is Hannibal: The Hannibal Montanabal Experience Here in the UK, it's possible for an especially talented performer to make the leap from open-mic comic to TV face in little more than a matter of months; Jack Whitehall and Andi Osho spring to mind. Over in the US, it can be more of a grind. Many of those we think of as supremely individual comic voices (Sarah Silverman, Stephen Colbert and Tina Fey) spent years in the salt mines of writers' rooms before getting their moment in the spotlight. Hannibal Buress is one of the gag-writing drones behind Fey's consistently funny sitcom 30 Rock, and based on his (amusingly but confusingly named) Edinburgh fringe debut, he may well have what it takes to follow in his mentor's footsteps on the path to mainstream fame. His slow, slightly drawling voice disguises a properly agile comic mind, and as you might expect, he comes out with a constant stream of very funny, well-honed jokes. Pleasance Courtyard, 9.45pm, to 29 Aug Tom Rosenthal: Child Of Privilege The title of Tom Rosenthal's Edinburgh debut immediately draws attention to a rather unusual showbiz pedigree for a novice stand-up: he's the son of renowned former ITV Sport anchor Jim. But among comedy fans, Rosenthal Jr is building an impressive reputation, courtesy of his work with Simon Bird in Robert Popper's acclaimed sitcom Friday Night Dinner. You don't get many young comics starring on television prior to crafting their first solo hour but he seems able to succeed under his own creative steam. A slightly nervy, eager-to-please performer (although it's all an act), Rosenthal is able to play to punters young and old. He's able to mine great comedy out of the concerns of his own generation (he's just 23) as well as sending them up for a wider audience. This show sees Rosenthal tackling his privileged status \u2013 as well as that of everyone in the developed world \u2013 in an hour that touches on base crudity and high-flown philosophy in equal measure. Pleasance Courtyard, 9.30pm, to 29 Aug"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
