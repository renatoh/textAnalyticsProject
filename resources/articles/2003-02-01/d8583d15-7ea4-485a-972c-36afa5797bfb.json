While Manchester United were at passport control in Turin's Caselle airport this week he could be found having a crafty cigarette in the public toilets. Not in the gents, though. The queue was too long and, besides, there was more peace and quiet inside the (presumably empty) ladies. Not that Barthez's fondness for the occasional Gitane has escaped the antennae of Sir Alex Ferguson. It is just that the manager is perhaps more willing to tolerate the Frenchman's vices than, say, David Beckham's or Ryan Giggs's. Ferguson knows Barthez is different. He has been described as everything from shy and aloof to arrogant and rude. And an hour in his company yesterday, looking ahead to Sunday's Worthington Cup final against Liverpool, revealed a man whose complexities take some fathoming. At first he is suspicious, pensive, distrusting. This is, after all, his first British newspaper interview since he joined the club from Monaco three years ago. By the end, however, the barriers are down. His response to the allegation of aloofness - \"there are certain players I get on with\" - hardly suggests he is the most convivial dressing-room occupant but it is hard not to warm to the 31-year-old from the foot of the Pyrenees. \"I'm a reserved person,\" he explains. \"I'm careful what I say in public and this can work against you in England. Maybe I'm not the average footballer. I don't play golf, anything like that. But people get the wrong idea. They don't understand how serious football is to me. This is my passion. I think and worry about my career.\" This image of dedication is not what has been portrayed since his now infamous mistakes against Arsenal and Deportivo La Coruna last season. Barthez has never been allowed to forget those errors but few could dispute he has redeemed himself. \"The expression 'Barthez the clown' has been used about me,\" he says. \"It started after that Arsenal game. There were photographers outside my house. It shows people don't appreciate the difficulties in goalkeeping. But to get angry would harm only yourself. \"People talk about my eccentricities, but am I really eccentric? I don't think so. When I dribble the ball out of the penalty area, it's not me showing off. I only do it when it's for the best of the team.\" There are similarities to be drawn with Jerzy Dudek, the other goalkeeper at the Millennium Stadium this weekend, whose reputation has been remoulded since a sequence of mistakes before Christmas. \"I have empathy for Jerzy. If a centre-forward misses a good chance it is not a disaster. But if Jerzy or I make a howler it is all over the newspapers. We are never allowed to forget,\" adds Barthez, who intends to stay to the end of his contract in 2007. However yellow the nicotine stains between his fingers, nobody should doubt his professionalism."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
