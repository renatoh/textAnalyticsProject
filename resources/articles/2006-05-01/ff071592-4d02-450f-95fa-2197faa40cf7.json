A few weeks ago, it was a man I know quite well, a man I like, and I confused him with a bald, Green MSP. A Lib Dem sitting nearby gurgled with laughter. Raised, as I was, on a hill farm, I used to pride myself on being able to pick out an animal at half a mile. Now I'm lucky to get across the street without being hit. So, last week, I visited my local optician. According to the disapproving receptionist, it has been years since my last visit (I recall; it was during a period of work-avoiding hypochondria that included acupuncture, osteopathy and fishing). 'Well, it's expensive,' I reply. 'Not now,' she tells me. 'Now it's free.' Free? Since when did things 'become' free? I came of age during the Thatcher years and nothing has ever become free in my experience. Instead, my lifetime has been marked by an erosion of government support: primary school milk; dental care; student grants; benefits. The sense of well-being this free sight test prompted in me explains much about public affection for the NHS. It is remarkable how few of us are aware of the change, which was brought in at the beginning of April. The Lib Dems, for whom it is a manifesto pledge delivered, claim that is because their Labour coalition partners don't like promoting Lib Dem successes. Perhaps. More importantly, it coincided with the smoking ban, which took up all the space in the newspapers. My optician is thrilled, though. Unlike the free tests that were phased out in the late 1980s, the new examination looks at the eye's health as well its ability to focus. Her hope is that many more people will use the test, ending unnecessary blindness. The Royal National Institute for the Blind says a blind person costs the state \u00a310,000 a year; in the same period, 300 people lose their jobs because they become blind. It is such statistics that allow the Lib Dems to argue against accusations of state profligacy. 'It's invest to save,' says Mike Rumbles, the party's former health spokesman, who saw through the programme. 'Our theme is preventive healthcare. There has been a huge uptake in the number of people taking the eye test. Regardless of income, regardless of wealth, this is for everyone.' A month in, such exuberance is a little presumptuous. While being very positive about the scheme, spokesmen for both Optometry Scotland and the RNIB say it is far too early to tell its effect. Still, nobody is going to bet on numbers going down. It is that sense of well-being that I still find striking, of being looked after, and that can't all be due to having a mother from parsimonious Fife. Professor Adrian Sinfield of Edinburgh University says that, over and above the health benefits, come civic advantages. 'When I've been teaching in some of the Scandinavian countries, they are very curious about the British individualistic view. They see this sort of thing as part of their solidarity.' Taken like that, this is a noticeable change in philosophy, and one entirely the result of devolution. Sinfield is currently campaigning to make school meals free, and others are fighting for free prescriptions. All of this costs - the Executive has earmarked \u00a329m for the first year - but I don't think it costs us our independence. Where there is a strong argument that a scheme will pay for itself through the improving health of the nation, surely it should be pursued. Whether my trip to the optician means I will be able to recognise my friends remains to be seen, but I know I walked out of the shop feeling both better, and part of something better. ruaridhnicoll@hotmail.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
