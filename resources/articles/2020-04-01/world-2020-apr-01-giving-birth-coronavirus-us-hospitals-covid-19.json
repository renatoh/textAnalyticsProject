But with coronavirus sweeping the country and the fear of hospitals soon being overrun with patients, things have gone more wrong than she could possibly have imagined. Birney \u2013 now in her third trimester \u2013 is preparing to deliver in the bedroom of her Los Angeles apartment. Birney, a clinical coach, had been thinking about using a nearby birthing center as an alternative to hospital when cases of Covid-19 were first reported in the US in January. But she has since switched to a home birth. \u201cThe deciding factor for us is largely the virus,\u201d she said, noting that delivering in a birthing center would mean contact with many more people and potentially greater risk of exposure. \u201cI might be rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic here, but if rearranging makes me feel better, then I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Pregnancy is always hard, even in the best of times. But as hospitals across the country prepare for a surge of coronavirus patients, some in the worst-affected areas are taking extreme precautions to contain the spread of the virus, including barring family and doulas from the delivery room. New York\u2019s governor this week said women in labor would be allowed to have a partner in the delivery room with them in public or private hospitals, despite the added risks. But nearly a million women are expected to give birth in the next three months and doctors\u2019 offices are being flooded with phone calls from concerned patients, unsure of whether to continue with prenatal appointments (doctors generally say yes), what plans they should make for delivery, and what would happen in the event they come down with Covid-19. Research on pregnancy and the coronavirus is limited given its first appearance in China just months ago, and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) advises pregnant women to follow physical distancing guidelines. So far scientists have found no evidence that mothers who test positive for Covid-19 can transmit it to their fetuses in utero. Pregnancy and childbirth do not seem to aggravate the typical course of symptoms. Once the baby is born, the CDC recommends a temporary mother-infant separation for mothers who have Covid-19, and offers guidance on breastfeeding precautions. \u201cBe extra neurotic and extra overprotective and extra hygienic with your hand-washing and face-washing,\u201d said Dr Harvey Karp, a longtime pediatrician and author of several blockbuster parenting books. \u201cYou have to plan for all contingencies.\u201d Ruthie Ackerman, a writer, writing instructor and content strategist in New York, is due to give birth in August. But in the era of coronavirus, she faces an exhausting set of decisions in a city that\u2019s become the center of US cases. It\u2019s not just a question of whether she should keep going to prenatal appointments, using public transportation to get there. After major New York hospitals, including Ackerman\u2019s, announced that they were completely restricting labor and delivery wards, meaning all visitors including partners would be barred from entering, Ackerman had questioned whether to scrap her birth plan and flee the state entirely. Others have fewer options. Jennifer Wright, who is 19 weeks pregnant in Winchester, Virginia \u2013 a small city in the rural Shenandoah Valley \u2013 lost her job at a local small business that sells shampoo and body care products recently when she was deemed non-essential amid the coronavirus shutdown. She had to get on Medicaid to afford her prenatal visits, and while she would love to make a nuanced birth plan weighing the risks presented by coronavirus, right now she has more immediate concerns. Wright has been quarantining with her three-year-old son. And though her boyfriend still has his job at a nearby restaurant, she\u2019s worried he might lose it any day. \u201cI\u2019m struggling to keep food on the table and diapers and wipes for my son in the house,\u201d she says. \u201cI could really use a financial blessing. I have rent and bills due.\u201d Jada Shapiro, the New York-based founder of Boober, a platform pairing parents with maternal care providers, and the childbirth education center Birth Day Presence, has had to reinvent her practice practically overnight. \u201cCovid is definitely making isolation for new parents worse right now, especially when people can\u2019t have their own family members come over and help them,\u201d she said. Shapiro is trying to help surround them in the only space that\u2019s safe \u2013 virtual space \u2013 and she has met with a lot of interest. A recent webinar in which she interviewed a top obstetrician had 500 signups within a day of being announced, with people registering from as far away as Hawaii. \u201cThe silver lining to this horrible situation is we\u2019re able to help people wherever we are,\u201d Shapiro said. But Audrey Stewart, a member of Birthmark Doula Collective in New Orleans, whose client base consists mostly of women of color who are lower-income, worries about equity in access when so many of her clients don\u2019t have reliable internet connections or a steady phone plan. \u201cI really do worry about people who are already vulnerable on the margins slipping through the cracks,\u201d she said. Stewart has also seen a huge rise in interest in home births. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely happening several times a day that someone toward the end of their third trimester is calling,\u201d she said. Louisiana already has one of the highest maternal death rates in the country, and the risk is increased almost fourfold for black women. Given the increased risk of adverse outcomes for Stewart\u2019s clients in particular, many feel it\u2019s too scary to go into the hospital at a time when many are barring all but a single support person. \u201cOur clients are mostly really aware of the disproportionate risk they face when giving birth, so I think the thought of going into the hospital feels extra scary right now,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cWe\u2019re already operating in a state of crisis,\u201d she added of her state\u2019s high maternal mortality rate, \u201cand now we\u2019re layering another major crisis on top of that.\u201d Stewart seeks to accommodate those seeking home births when possible. But other health authorities have cautioned against making last-minute plans to have a home birth. \u201cThe leading data seems to suggest that there are slightly higher infant mortality risks for home births, and there is a large risk of hospital transfer,\u201d said Emily Oster, the Brown economist and author of parenting books. The risk of hospital transfer is about 30% for first-time moms in the US, according to Oster\u2019s data. \u201cIf you plan a home birth at the last minute, any risks like this are probably larger than they\u2019d be for more advance planning. The Covid risks to pregnant women and infants seem to be small.\u201d Birney, who is about 10 weeks out from her due date but has a standing relationship with the home birth midwife she would use, says she doesn\u2019t only want to weigh statistics when she makes her choice. \u201cI have to make my best educated choice \u2026 There\u2019s only so much we can control.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
