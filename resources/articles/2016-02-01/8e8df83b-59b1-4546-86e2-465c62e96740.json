Sitting outside the house she shares with her meek sister Clare (Siobhan Finneran), Catherine enjoys telling her incredulous sibling the story of three lads in Halifax who, while \u201coff their heads on acid\u201d, stole a sheep and let it loose on a housing estate, where it was mauled by dogs. A comic anecdote \u2013 even if it\u2019s a bloody one involving savaged livestock \u2013 seems an audacious way for writer Sally Wainwright to open season two of a show that in 2014 was critics\u2019 and audiences\u2019 top new drama of the year. Then it was a gripping, unflinchingly brutal thriller. What\u2019s this? Happy Valley is about how drugs and poverty makepeople do stupid things. For a policewoman given the impossible task of cleaning up Yorkshire\u2019s Calder Valley, every day is a cavalcade of criminal idiocy. But boredom and fecklessness tip over easily into rage and serious violence \u2013 and Catherine treats the farce and horror as twin impostors. They\u2019re never far apart. As the flashback continues, she\u2019s nicking the sheep-rustlers and trying to ignore them spitting abuse at her, when she notices a smell coming from a nearby lock-up. Inside is a rotting human corpse. Roll titles. After that brilliant cold opening, we\u2019re in an unfamiliar semi-detached house. A middle-aged dad (Kevin Doyle) barely listens as three kids bicker with Mum (Julie Hesmondhalgh). Dad gets a worrying text. He sneaks out \u2013 nobody notices \u2013 and down the road to where a woman (Amelia Bullmore), younger and more glamorous than his wife, is in her car. \u201cI\u2019ve phoned you 16 times!\u201d Her neck veins are bulging. He blames work stress, but this looks like less than half the real reason. \u201cI love you!\u201d \u201cYeah ... I\u2019ll ring you.\u201d Helen Gallagher lies in a hospice bed, watched over by her husband and daughter, Nevison and Ann \u2013 the target and victim of season one\u2019s horribly bungled ransom plot. Clare is there too, relaying the story of Catherine and the sheep, and providing light black comedy through her insistence on mouthing \u201cdead body\u201d and \u201cdecomposed\u201d like Les Dawson gossiping with Roy Barraclough. Nevison and Ann argue mildly about the new job she\u2019s been training for \u2026 \u201cForget everything they taught you in training, because none of it works in the real world\u201d The next day is Ann\u2019s first on the force, working under Catherine, whose blast of motherly advice is a typically tight piece of script that skilfully references their shared past. In season one, Catherine\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Kirsten was murdered while on duty by Tommy , who years before raped Catherine\u2019s daughter Becky, driving her to suicide. After Ann and Catherine helped each other escape from Royce, Ann vowed not to become a victim. She\u2019s following through on that now, but it means Catherine has another surrogate daughter to worry about. Homicide detectives have arrived. Two of them are Vincent Franklin and Katherine Kelly and another is John, the philandering dad. A briefing reveals that the body found by Catherine was Lynn Dewhurst \u2013 Tommy\u2019s mother. Tommy is in his cell watching daytime telly. The prison chaplain comes in and gives Tommy the news, needlessly adding that Lynn was sexually assaulted. He\u2019s petrified, as are we, that Tommy could spring off the bed at any second and punch the messenger. Instead, he breaks down. James Norton nails it: shock \u2013 and then tears \u2013 but with a hint of steel, he already starts planning his revenge. As the police investigation begins, John finally rings his mistress, Vicky. She isn\u2019t pleased when John \u2013 oh no, John, mate, don\u2019t \u2013 dumps her by phone. But she has something to bargain with. That police warrant card he lost? She\u2019s found it under her bed, and tells him to meet her later to get it back. At the nick, Catherine is indignant at being grilled by Kelly\u2019s young detective about some threatening voicemails she left Tommy\u2019s mother. Lancashire is fabulous once again: Catherine chatters with her signature mix of nous and defiance about how Lynn had approached Ryan after school, in breach of a court order. It\u2019s a poised two-hander, with Kelly officious and brusque, and Lancashire edgy and desperate beneath Catherine\u2019s bluster. Another theme of Happy Valley is Catherine\u2019s inability to stop the tide of brutality sweeping into her own family: even with Tommy in prison, his mother wouldn\u2019t go away. Even with his mother dead, they still cause strife. Outside, Ann passes on hearsay about the assault Lynn suffered: she was raped with a broken bottle. Happy Valley can get away with such an extreme image because of its depth of realism, and not be charged with indulging in gratuitous nastiness. Catherine comes home, fuming, to find Clare at the kitchen table with her old schoolfriend Neil. She bumped into him earlier and was charmed by a similarly humble, troubled soul back on the scene after a divorce. A subtle performance by Con O\u2019Neill alerts us there\u2019s a story he isn\u2019t telling \u2013 Clare doesn\u2019t notice that he leaves when he sees Catherine\u2019s police badge. \u201cThat\u2019s not how I feel, John. I\u2019m ... disappointed.\u201d John meets Vicky in a country pub. She\u2019s waiting for him, pint on table, and listens as he splurges a barely improved attempt to brush her off. In jail, Tommy discusses his mum with a visitor. Everything that was great in season one about Norton\u2019s performance is back, as he makes us feel pity as well as fear and disgust. There\u2019s boiling misogyny in his sweeping observation that \u201cI know how a bitch like that [Catherine] thinks.\u201d When he talks about how that bitch has obviously committed murder and will now be protected by a police cover-up, we see how deluded he is. Across the table is Frances, a ratty woman played by another big name, Shirley Henderson. Her first scene is an amazingly bold and physical piece of acting. Frances is grotesquely flirty, getting off on being Tommy\u2019s confidante despite, or because of, the hate he\u2019s spewing. When he stops ranting, she strokes his head and says she loves him. Brrrrrrr. John, drugged, was helped into his car outside the pub by Vicky and, having briefly woken to find himself naked and alone in a budget hotel, now comes round once more. It\u2019s morning and he\u2019s in his car. John\u2019s not an especially large man but Vicky must either have an accomplice, or superhuman strength when wronged. Anyway, he\u2019s just in time for work, where it\u2019s announced that Lynn is the latest victim of a serial killer. \u201cJust tick the boxes!\u201d If a serial killer is targeting prostitutes, Catherine is clearly innocent, but homicide still want their alibi. This brings out the only element of Sgt Cawood\u2019s character that leans toward cliche: she\u2019s a no-nonsense maverick who hates bureaucracy, and runs rings round her box-ticker boss Mike when he asks her to comply. Have her dim colleagues thought to head to where the local sex workers tout for business? Of course they haven\u2019t, so Catherine drives to the red light district with a carrier bag of sandwiches for two jittery, emaciated girls she knows by name. Their hopeless inadequacy is eerily like that of the addled Lynn, who could never get off drugs and ended up raising a killer. Ryan is at home with his uncle Daniel, Catherine\u2019s estranged son who\u2019s come to kip on the sofa because his marriage is crumbling. Daniel carelessly mentions that he wouldn\u2019t be drinking beer if Clare were in the house. Her status as a recovering addict is another hideous secret from which Ryan hasn\u2019t quite been shielded. Just as John\u2019s lying to his wife about his whereabouts last night, Vicky texts him photos of himself unconscious in the hotel wearing women\u2019s underwear. She\u2019ll forward them to everyone he knows if he doesn\u2019t give her \u00a31,000 a month, in cash \u2026 So, what did you think of Happy Valley\u2019s return? Anything featuring Kevin Doyle, Julie Hesmondhalgh and Amelia Bullmore promises excellence. That should dispel the feeling that the new John/Vicky strand is, so far, a fairly boilerplate spurned-woman blackmail tale, which doesn\u2019t interact with what we\u2019re really interested in: Catherine Cawood versus Tommy Lee Royce. Can Wainwright concoct a reason for them to face each other again? Mystery of the week What is the deal with Catherine and Clare\u2019s back yard? They\u2019ve not actually got one: they\u2019ve taken advantage of living in the last house on a dead-end street and put their table, chairs and plant pots in the road. Cheeky. At best, sitting in the street smoking at all hours seems a cavalier attitude to the ever-looming threat of Yorkshire\u2019s worst criminals. No-nonsense idiom of the week Time for Netflix to call the subtitlers when this episode hits the US: \u201cYou could never be certain lift\u2019d gone to t\u2019top floor, her brain were so addled wi\u2019 crap\u201d \u2013 Catherine on why she rang Lynn a second time. Hurt in the line of duty Happy Valley promo shots demand thatLancashire sport a battle wound and, sure enough, by the time she\u2019s told the sheep anecdote she\u2019s already acquired a cut cheek. It must be from struggling to arrest the tripping farm-burglars, but we don\u2019t see it happen and Catherine is so used to being punched by low-lifes, she doesn\u2019t even mention it.
