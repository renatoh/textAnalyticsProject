Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, the cleric who delivered the Friday prayer sermon broadcast across Iran, said: \"Will bombs and the use of force bring democracy and freedom? It definitely will not.\" The worshippers responded with shouts of \"Death to America!\" and \"Death to Britain!\" Mr Yazdi, a hard-line cleric who is opposed to the reformist policies of President Mohammad Khatami, accused the US of taking the world back to the days of \"the law of the jungle\", when \"the mighty ruled over the weak\". Some of the demonstrators called for the closure of the British embassy. The US has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since 1979, when Iranian militants stormed the American embassy and held its personnel hostage for more than a year. Tens of thousands of people took part in protests in Iran. One of them, 40 year-old Roya Shasian, told Reuters: \"I'm afraid of America, because it is possible that we will be next after Iraq.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
