Just as Chris Makin had deflected a cross into Kevin Pressman's goal at Coventry City on Saturday, Matt Heath followed suit with a header past the veteran keeper. Yet, while the equaliser was fortuitous, it was no more than Joe Royle's watchable collection of youngsters and free transfers deserved, not least because they were denied what appeared a perfectly good goal shortly before the bizarre denouement. Much to the amazement of many inside the Walkers Stadium, including Royle, the referee Tony Leake ruled that the Ipswich striker Shefki Kuqi had kicked the ball out of Pressman's hands before prodding it over the goalline. \"I was puzzled by his decision,\" I've got a lot of time for the referee - he's one of the better officials. But I think he'll be embarrassed when he looks at a replay of the incident. It was obvious from where I was that the keeper had dropped the ball; it was a bar of soap job. There was no one near him. And you do not often see my players bother referees but they became quite animated.\" Heath's gaffe, however, not only defused the controversy but also earned him the unenviable distinction of scoring at both ends. Earlier his right-footed volley that dispatched Jamie Scowcroft's headed knock-down past Lewis Price looked to have sealed a spirited comeback from the Foxes. That followed an inauspicious start which saw the visitors score from their first attack when Ian Westlake chipped the ball home after Pressman had blocked a shot by Darren Bent. Bent, another of Ipswich's youngsters, came within a whisker of adding a second when his left-foot shot deflected off Heath and just wide of Pressman's right-hand post. Yet come half-time, the visitors were indebted to Price, their least experienced player, for remaining on level terms. Lewis, who was making only his fourth league start, made three superb saves but was helpless to intervene when David Connolly equalised - courtesy of yet another Scowcroft knockdown. Danny Tiatto and Connolly twice were also thwarted before Heath ended his resistance. Pressman, meanwhile, was similarly inspired as Ipswich produced the menacing football that made them the Championship's joint-leading scorers before kick off. Heath's effort, however, proved unstoppable but, predictably, did not leave the garrulous Bassett lost for words. Neither did it subdue his optimism for Leicester City's future but whether it will be under his control remains uncertain. \"I saw enough there to know there is scope for improvement,\" he said. \"I expect to be in charge of the side against Stoke on Saturday. After that things will depend on the board's strategy.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
