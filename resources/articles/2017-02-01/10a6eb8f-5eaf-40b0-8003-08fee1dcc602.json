His second show for the house took place in the courtyard of the new HQ, which is still under construction. The assembled fashion crowd, including Kate Moss and Jane Birkin, took their places \u2013 with Saint Laurent-branded blankets handed out as an attempt to stave off any chill \u2013 on marble seating surrounded by scaffolding. A digger, presumably used by the construction team earlier in the day, formed the backdrop. Vaccarello didn\u2019t count on the rain, which began falling with the start of the show. But the designer couldn\u2019t be accused of a lack of effort. This show, with diverse casting, was around 100 looks and three collections \u2013 one womenswear, one menswear and a finale of evening dresses. Like his first collection, it was a collage of the brand\u2019s rich history, mixed with Vaccarello\u2019s own sexy take on glamour. \u201cI love Monsieur Saint Laurent\u2019s subversive approach to clothes, his dark romanticism with a hint of perversity,\u201d the show notes read. \u201cI wanted this collection to be like a re-reading, a radical fantasy of this heritage.\u201d A lot of those clothes looked set for the most hedonistic of nightclubs \u2013 of which Saint Laurent, in his youth anyway, was a fan. For womenswear, while there was a concession to daywear with skinny jeans and sweaters, 80s-style cocktail dresses dominated, made of everything from leather to vinyl, velvet and chiffon. Most looks were paired with ruched leather knee-high boots and a cone heel. Expect to see them in a lot of fashion shoots come autumn. The menswear featured slouchy tuxedo trousers, simple shirts and a selection of boxy jackets that will no doubt be replicated on the high street. The finale provided the sucker punch \u2013 dresses, boots, shirts, sweatshirts, skirts, jackets all covered in crystals. An astute photo op intended to have #saintlaurent trending on social media within minutes. It even meant that those watching forgot \u2013 for a moment \u2013 about the rain. Vaccarello\u2019s approach is one that appeals to the digital native generation. \u201cI think it\u2019s not about changing identity,\u201d the designer told the New York Times this month. \u201cIt\u2019s about making it for now.\u201d This chimes with Saint Laurent himself. He designed a collection based on beatnik style in 1960 and launched his ready-to-wear line Rive Gauche in 1967 in a bid to court younger customers. The 37-year-old Vaccarello joined Saint Laurent in April 2016, following the departure of Hedi Slimane. He has a hard act \u2013 acts \u2013 to follow. Slimane\u2019s era at Saint Laurent was incredibly financially successful \u2013 tripling the size of the brand in the four years he was there \u2013 while Tom Ford and Yves Saint Laurent himself are hardly small fry in term of fashion influence. Vaccarello, who grew up between Belgium and Italy, previously had his own label and worked with Versace line Versus. His reputation was forged on a look that came with leg splits as standard on dresses and Helmut Newton on the moodboard. This confident sexuality works for Saint Laurent. The Le Smoking tuxedo, a woman\u2019s take on a man\u2019s suit, featured heavily in Newton\u2019s 70s images. Slimane\u2019s future is unclear. He has worked on photography projects in 2017, and issued a statement last year saying will not be setting up a brand in his own name. However, according to interviews, fashion is not off the table completely so a role at another house could be a possibility. Saint Laurent is now the second-biggest brand in the Kering conglomerate, after Gucci. This month, they announced total revenues of \u00a31.03bn. The sales for Vaccarello\u2019s first collection remain to be seen. But Kering\u2019s financial wing will see this second collection as a next step to further growth as Vaccarello makes his mark on the brand."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
