Former 1D member on the prowl", "bodyText": "Liam Payne recently lamented that when One Direction\u2019s management realised he was the sensible one, they made him keep his bandmates in check. Getting cast as Mr Boring was annoying, he explained, yielding him the least screams from fans. Happily for Payne, solo freedom has let him reap maximum screams and embrace his officiousness: with 3.7bn streams, he is the most commercially popular 1D member. It\u2019s hard to see why. Despite LP1\u2019s effortful attempts to cast Payne as a sexual piranha, the 26-year-old generally comes off as an uptight scold. On Hips Don\u2019t Lie, he stares at a woman\u2019s groin as she dances and warns that she\u2019d better not be wasting his time. \u201cI hope your hips don\u2019t lie unless they\u2019re lying with me,\u201d he sings, a conclusion so deathly it feels like a funeral for reproduction. The thrumming Rude Hours finds him inviting a lady to a \u201cparking lot\u201d. \u201cMight be a bad idea,\u201d he admits, \u201cI\u2019ll probably do your ass in the car.\u201d But never let it be said that Payne is boring and responsible: \u201cKey unlocks the door, ticket on the floor.\u201d If it\u2019s a pay and display, there\u2019ll be murder if it\u2019s not clearly visible. Stack It Up is halfway between a 2003 50 Cent single and the Tory manifesto: \u201cIf you wanna stack it up,\u201d he advises, \u201cyou gotta work for it.\u201d Such are the accidental highs of an album empty of intentional humour, heart, or anything much human at all beyond base carnality. Its generic trap and Latin-tinged production and its many guest rappers suggest Payne is trying to keep pace with Drake and the Weeknd. He can\u2019t, because his rank randiness lacks the sense of guilty pleasure that makes his Canadian contemporaries irresistible. The simmering Both Ways, about a woman who loves threesomes, finds him and her \u201csharing that body like it\u2019s our last meal\u201d, like cheetahs at a carcass. On Familiar, he admires a lady who\u2019s \u201cshaped like a model or some kind of bottle\u201d \u2013 Orangina? Ketchup? Perhaps this leg-crossing horror show is another sign of Payne\u2019s prudence: LP1 is a terrible pop album, but very effective contraception."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
