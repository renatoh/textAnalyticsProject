Constellation Energy, which boasts of being the biggest wholesale power provider in the US, and Perry Capital, a New York hedge fund, yesterday said they might make a cash offer worth about \u00a31.9bn for the Drax business. The consortium is understood to have asked Drax for permission to undertake due diligence ahead of a formal offer, which comes as the once-stricken firm prepares for a return to the stock market. Drax, whose six generators produce 4,000 megawatts or 7% of Britain's electricity, is controlled by a group of bond and equity holders after a financial reconstruction. The Selby plant was hit when its main customer, TXU of America, ran into trouble amid a slump in power prices. Yesterday, Drax management put out a statement which said: \"Constellation Energy Group and Perry Capital and its affiliates together confirm that they have approached the board of Drax Group Ltd with a view to making a cash offer for the company at an enterprise value of \u00a31.9bn, subject to certain conditions.\" Constellation Energy and Perry Capital have engaged Lazard as financial adviser and CSFB to help. Meanwhile, British Energy has been forced to shut down four of its nuclear reactors at Heysham and Hartlepool. The move is a setback for the firm, which produces 25% of the country's electricity, just days before it publishes plans to extend the life of other ageing facilities for 10 years. It will also stoke concerns, highlighted again by unions this week, that Britain is going into a winter without adequate and reliable gas and other power supplies ready. The problems came to light after inspections of \"boiler closure units\", which showed potential for stress corrosion cracking. British Energy declined to say exactly when it might bring the reactors back into service, saying this would give commercially sensitive information away to its competitors. It also insisted that net additional unplanned power losses were expected to be about 1 terawatt hour. British Energy shares fell 2% to 460p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
