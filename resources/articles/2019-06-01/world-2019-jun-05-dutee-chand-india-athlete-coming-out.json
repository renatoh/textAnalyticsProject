Local reaction was hostile in Chaka Gopalpur, a village of weavers in Odisha, after Dutee Chand, the country\u2019s fastest sprinter, told reporters on 19 May that her gay partner was her soulmate. Chand\u2019s mother, Akhuji, told the Indian Express: \u201cI had been supporting her all along for her special interest in sports but \u2026 we belong to a traditional weaver community, which does not permit such things. How can we face our relatives and society?\u201d Prashant Behra, a villager, said: \u201cIt\u2019s humiliating for all of us. We have supported her all the way in her running but we cannot accept this relationship. Marriage can only be between a man and a woman. She should never have talked about it to the whole world. She should stick to running.\u201d Chand, 23, was also praised for her courage in coming out. Many called it a watershed moment for Indian society, which has hardly any gay celebrities. But the backlash is thought to have taken her aback and her partner has now left for another town because of hostile remarks by people in their village. Chand said: \u201cThey have been telling me to marry a man and have children. That\u2019s the only tradition they know. \u201cBut everyone I know in the city where I studied supports me. I don\u2019t know if my family and village will come round. I will have to wait and see.\u201d Some are worried about her safety in the current climate, in which extremist mobs can appear from nowhere to assault or lynch Muslims or those of a different sexuality. On 26 May, a 19-year-old woman in Odisha was dragged out of her house, tied to a tree and beaten by villagers for being in a lesbian relationship. Reports say the assault happened after villagers found the two women in bed. Payoshni Mitra, a former government-appointed adviser to Chand who now works as an athletes\u2019 rights activist, said: \u201cWith the return of the rightwing Bharatiya Janata party to power, a series of attacks on minorities, including sexual minorities, are being reported. \u201cHowever, while it could be dangerous to be openly gay, one cannot live in fear of the consequences \u2013 and Dutee\u2019s coming out gives us that message.\u201d While attitudes in urban India are gradually changing, in rural India, dating between young people of the opposite sex is still frowned upon and homosexuality is seen as beyond the pale. The supreme court last year overturned a colonial-era ban on gay sex, but the ruling found little backing in villages. However, rural Indians can often turn a blind eye if same-sex relationships are conducted discreetly. But Chand remained unbowed. \u201cI am not a child who blindly does what her parents say,\u201d she said. \u201cI am grown up. I will spend my life with who I want, but I will also fulfil my responsibility to my family.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 5 June 2019 to clarify a description of extremist mobs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
