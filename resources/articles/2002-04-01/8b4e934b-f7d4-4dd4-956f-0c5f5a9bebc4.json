Robinson, the Labour member for Coventry North West and former paymaster general, had passed a vote of no confidence in Richardson, the chairman of nine years, during January and only a week after joining the board. Richardson then parted company. Richardson, who has always insisted that he did not resign, is suing for \u00a3300,000 which he claims he is owed by the club. Richardson retains a large stake - 37% he claims, Robinson alleges 31% - but Robinson yesterday accused him of \"repeated misrepresentations\" regarding the purchase price of the stock he bought in 1996. Coventry fired their second manager of the season on Tuesday when Roland Nilsson, in charge for six months, and his assistant Jim Smith, on the payroll for only four, were told to clear their desks after it had became apparent that the hard-up First Division club would not make the play-offs. Gillingham's manager Andy Hessenthaler has pledged to do all he can to persuade Paul Scally to stay following the chairman's threat to walk out as a result of his long-running feud with the Independent Supporters Club committee, whom he described as \"negative, soul-destroying people\". Hessenthaler said: \"If the chairman stepped down or sold up I'd be worried for this club. I'm hoping he'll change his mind and I'm going to try and convince him to.\" Three first-team players, Paul Smith, Chris Hope and Barry Ashby, attended the supporters' club awards dinner last Saturday and this week were all fined for \"a serious breach of club procedures\". Scally claimed the trio's presence at the unofficial night \"undermined my authority, the managers' authority and our standing with three key players\". All three, who feel they were \"misled\", have since apologised and handed back their awards. Fulham, meanwhile, have failed to reach agreement with their \u00a32m-a-season shirt sponsor Pizza Hut. James O'Reilly, the company's United Kingdom marketing director, said: \"We made an informed offer in line with what we believe the market value of sponsorships of this type are worth. As sometimes happens with sponsorships, it could not be extended.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
