Hunched over a beer in the Ritz bar, the former Israeli platoon commander picks his words cautiously, careful not to trigger any journalistic limpet mines placed in his way. But, then, considering his company has been on the receiving end of a $3 billion lawsuit, Peled's softly, softly approach is not surprising. A Romanian refuge whose earliest ambition was to live in a house with indoor plumbing ('As a kid I wanted to not have to go out to an outhouse,' he told one interviewer), Peled, 56, has enjoyed a coruscating career. One of only a handful of people in the world on first-name terms with Rupert Murdoch, Peled is president and chief executive officer of Nasdaq-listed NDS, until recently a little-known but highly successful News Corp subsidiary that makes the software behind many of the world's leading digital pay TV platforms, including that of BSkyB. Thanks to Peled, a former IBM vice-president, the Middlesex-based company has become one of the jewel's in King Murdoch's crown. 'We grow faster than the rest of News Corp and we contribute to profits more than our share. They like us,' Peled says proudly. The potential market for its products is huge. 'Only 80 million out of 500 million homes that have pay TV worldwide are digital. There is still a huge opportunity, it's a great gold rush.' Interactivity will bring new revenue streams to the medium. 'You could see, for example, a time where you could type in something like 'I'm interested on going on vacation to the Caribbean' and then adverts will be downloaded on that basis. It's more useful for you as well as better-targeted for advertisers.' Games are also a potential revenue driver. 'Pretty soon they will be comparable to the quality of Playstation One games. Games is a very big business - more than the movie industry.' Things had been looking very bright for NDS until earlier this year, when a rival software firm, a subsidiary of News Corp's chief European antagonist, French media conglomerate Vivendi, accused it of leaking its smart card codes to a hackers' website, DR7.com. The rival firm, Canal Plus Technologies, claimed clients such as ITV Digital had lost millions as a result of hundreds of thousands of counterfeit smart cards flooding the market. It subsequently emerged that NDS, on whose board both Lachlan and James Murdoch sit, had funded a group of hackers. The idea was that by keeping close to the hackers NDS could monitor developments in software piracy. One key figure NDS tried to recruit was Boris Floricic, the outstanding hacker of his generation who belonged to the infamous German group Chaos Computer Club. Floricic was found hanging from a tree in a Berlin park in October 1998. As soon as Canal Plus filed its lawsuit, Peled, who, despite his ultra-serious persona, is described by colleagues as a 'lot of fun', was hauled from the comfort of lucrative anonymity into the glare of a suspicious, often anti-Murdoch press. The suit was brought under US anti-trust charges, with Canal Plus Technologies filing a claim for damages of up to $3bn - a fatal blow for News Corp. Then, two months ago, the matter looked settled. Vivendi prepared to drop the claim after News Corp agreed to buy its Italian pay TV arm, Telepiu. But that deal is now on ice. A possible break-up of Vivendi has meant that News Corp is reluctant to pay the price agreed and as such the exact status of the law suit is uncertain. Peled is, however, confident the matter will be resolved. 'I think the deal is still cooking. There have been some positive announcements recently.' Whatever the outcome, it appears US satellite operator DirecTV, a major NDS client, has decided to take its system in house. Peled is sanguine. America, it seems is not where NDS's growth will come from in the short term. Currently the US pay TV market is dominated by Motorola and Scientific Atlanta, which have assiduously managed to keep NDS out. 'It's a very important market for us to get into, but it will take time.' Despite the negative publicity surrounding the court case, NDS's business appears to have gone from strength to strength over the last 12 months. Revenue growth is up 12 per cent year-on-year to \u00a3240 million. Operating profits are up 22 per cent over the same period. Considering how bombed out the media sector is at the moment, these figures speak volumes. 'These are pretty good results in this environment. We are outpacing our competitors. We have given guidance for next year of 8-11 per cent revenue growth and 18 per cent profit growth.' Nevertheless, NDS, like other tech stocks, has not been immune to the Nasdaq's slump. Its share price is around $10, a third of where it was a year ago. Today NDS is worth a little over $500m. Peled must have felt a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when Canal Plus launched its action. He and his company have come under the uncomfortable scrutiny of the authorities before. In October 1996 tax officials raided the company's offices in Israel, where NDS does most of its research and development. Later the same year, Peled was interrogated by Israeli police after tapes of bugged telephone conversations between tax inspectors were found in a safe in his office. The year before, it emerged that the company's head in Israel, Michael Clinger, had pulled off a fraud that cost NDS $19m. For Peled, who was recruited by Murdoch in 1995, dealing with the aftermath was a baptism of fire. Not that Peled is unused to tense situations. He was a commander during the Six Day War between Israel and the Arab states and subsequently enlisted in the Israeli Army's signal corps before emigrating to the US. He went on to complete a PhD at Princeton University before moving to IBM, where he helped develop a supercomputer that created special effects for Hollywood blockbusters. This background may have helped Peled understand what consumers want from the small screen. 'We have always been focused on the fact that the killer application of digital television is more exciting, entertaining television - not the internet or other things.' Simplicity is key. 'I remember dealing with UPC (the European cable company) and they were proudly saying \"we haven't got a set-top box, we've got a set- top computer which is internet, telephony and computer combined\". I said: \"It's going to be hard to get that money [around $500 per box] back. You're going to have to get a lot of revenues per subscribers.\" In the process they forgot to emphasise television.' This is Peled's mantra. 'People don't care whether they get television analogue or digital or by telepathy, quite frankly. They care what's on it and what they can do with it.' Murdoch agrees. Peled tells the story of how at one News Corp brainstorming session an expert proclaimed that the internet, not television, was the future. Murdoch was out the door in seconds. For now NDS's main target is the Asia-Pacific market. 'We started about four and half years ago and we've developed a strong presence in the region. We've cultivated relationships, we've developed local applications, local electronic programme guides and in the last year and a half that has started bearing fruit.' There is a lot to play for. The sooner NDS manages to put the small matter of a multi-billion dollar lawsuit behind it, the sooner Peled can concentrate on what he does best: making money for Murdoch. What they say 'Peled is a lot of fun... I consider him a friend, someone I enjoy working with. He's very enriching and brings a lot of value to the conversation' News Corp vice-president Andy Setos 'He's got a reputation for being impatient. If people don't measure up, he lets them know very quickly' Former NDS employee 'You don't get to where he is, one of Murdoch's most trusted lieutenants, without playing hardball' US IT journalist Profile Name Abe Peled Job title President and chief executive, NDS Age 56 Education Masters in electrical engineering from Technion-Israel Institute of Technology; PhD Princeton University Hobbies Dining out, theatre-going"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
