That is, it\u2019s a memoir, but one told in the rebarbatively mannered style of his late trilogy of novels running from Umbrella to Phone \u2013 in which the narrative runs in great associative stream-of-consciousness skeins, shot through with buried quotations from song lyrics, inane catchphrases and second-order cliches ironised with italics and, especially where they end a sentence, preceded with the little drum-fill of an ellipsis. It could be that Self has decided that this is the best available narrative analogue for the working of the human mind, and that he\u2019s from now on determined to ... stick to it. To do it again ... annagain. Or it could be that he\u2019s fallen victim to the view that if you have a hammer everything looks ... like a nail. If you don\u2019t dig it, you won\u2019t dig this. I dug it in the fiction, but I only half dug it here: it has an evasive quality where memoir seems to ask for more directness; or, at least, a different sort of indirectness. And sometimes it just seems like an affectation. Buying smack from an off-duty nurse, he writes: \u201cAs she\u2019d urged Will, cheerily, to take a pew ... it became clear to him that the patient Janey was nursing ... was herself.\u201d You can make the case for the first set of italics, perhaps \u2013 but not the second. At the same time, that stylistic continuity invites you to read the material here back into Self\u2019s fictional preoccupations and, in places, his public persona. The adolescent Self says of his friends: \u201cHe believes Mark and the others find him both funny \u2013 and outrageous: qualities he plays up to then hates himself and them for.\u201d We see humans travelling in automative loops \u2013 around cities, front gardens \u2013 like flies around a lightbulb; reprising the circular walks that gave Umbrella its structure. We revisit Self\u2019s essentially cubist approach to time \u2013 as a series of intense, constellated moments in which other moments are embedded; and with reference to Zeno\u2019s paradox. In his solo motorcycle journey across the Australian outback we glimpse, perhaps, the landscape of one of his odder novels, The Butt. And, front and centre, there\u2019s his interest in repetition: things going around ... annaround, happening again ... annagain. The book is in five parts, each centring on a particular moment with associated memories woven through it. We meet Will first in May 1986, jonesing on a south London street first thing in the morning and wondering if he can, by turning the 57p in his pocket into a pair of Greggs apple danishes, charm one of his friends into giving him some heroin. Then we meet him in 1979, about to do his A-levels. Then we\u2019re with him in Oxford in 1982, on his way to the post-Finals viva that will result in his third. Then it\u2019s 1984, and he\u2019s on his travels \u2013 withdrawing (again) in the YMCA in Delhi and listening to Indian Christians rehearsing a passion play in the building opposite. Finally it\u2019s 1986 and he\u2019s in rehab, wanking an astounding amount and resisting the \u201cbogus syncretism of evangelical Christianity and sub-Freudian psychotherapy\u201d on offer. War stories are told \u2013 he crashes his car, he overdoses, he sets himself on fire and so forth \u2013 but Self doesn\u2019t follow the trad recovery-memoir pattern of exculpatory childhood trauma and exemplary redemption through spiritual change. His snobbish contempt for his essentially blameless suburban parents is set out; his snobbish contempt for the bromides of recovery (\u201che knows a sickening bunch of wowsers ... when he sees them\u201d) likewise. But, of course, he does recover: contempt and dismissal of the got-God \u201cthickos\u201d in the programme is also a front, and when he\u2019s threatened with expulsion from rehab he, weepingly, capitulates. Addicts, recovery boilerplate will tell you, are self-obsessed, grandiose, self-pitying, arrogant, infantile, trapped in a repetition compulsion \u2013 and all these qualities are unsparingly and knowingly showcased here. Self doesn\u2019t shill for sympathy. His feelings towards most other human beings run the slim gamut between envy and contempt (except in the moving closing passage where he talks about the death of his drug-takingfriend Hughie), and there\u2019s a startling moment where he suggests that his hidden inner self is, in fact, that of Caius \u2013 the aristocratic frenemy identified by one reviewer as Edward St Aubyn. Why did he get addicted in the first place? Pretentiousness seems to have been high in the mix. The young Self was reading enthusiastically about hard drugs long before he did them, and the book is full of quotes from Crowley, Cocteau, De Quincey, and \u201cBrother Bill\u201d Burroughs. \u201cWill, generally speaking, approves of homosexuality,\u201d he writes early on \u2013 \u201ctogether with violent anarchism and drug addiction, it\u2019s part of a trinity of subversive activities he quite fancies.\u201d As someone \u2013 I think it was Russell Brand \u2013 said: \u201cThe thing about heroin is, it\u2019s very more-ish.\u201d So Will is, in its way \u2013 because of rather than despite its protagonist being so unlikable \u2013 an honest-seeming memoir of the experience of addiction. And it ends with a rather haunting sentence through which you could profitably read what comes before: \u201cThe Will-of-the-future\u2019s a ghost in full sunlight on a crowded street, and you can see right through him.\u201d \u2022 Will is published by Viking (\u00a314.99).
