In a time fractions outside his T44 Paralympic 100m world record of 10.75sec, he explains that he wants to smash the 10-second barrier, be as big a cross-over star as Oscar Pistorius, and leave an everlasting mark on his sport. And he is just warming up. Browne has a reputation for not only stirring the pot but attaching a high-speed blender to it. Yet the 22-year-old American, who competes in the Glasgow British Athletics International Match on Saturday afternoon, says he is more soothsayer than provocateur. \"I call it as I see it,\" he says. \"I got a lot of backlash for saying I was going to break the world record and beat Jonnie Peacock in the Anniversary Games but hey, I did everything I said I was going to do.\" Ask him to forecast the year ahead and Browne shoots further into the stratosphere. \"I feel like 10.2sec is a possibility,\" he says. \"After we did the Great City Games in Newcastle, [the American sprinter] Mike Rodgers told me 'you can run 10.2 easy', so that's the aim. But by 2016 I believe I could be running sub-10, so come Rio there could be an amputee \u2013 myself \u2013 lined up at the Olympic Games in a 4x100m or in the 100m or 200m.\" Browne knows most people believe such hyper-accelerated improvement is impossible. He has heard similar sentiments before. It is tinnitus in his ears, something to tune out until he forgets that it is even there. And why should Browne believe the sceptics, given the strides he has taken since losing his right leg in 2010? Attempting to take refuge from a storm he slipped on a mat at a laundromat and crashed through the front-door glass, shredding his leg; 14 surgeries later it had to be removed. Browne overcame that hurdle. Now he wants to clear others. He says he is significantly stronger after months of winter training and in Glasgow intends to show it. \"I've been working on my technique because I don't want to run like an amputee,\" he says. \"I've been watching people like Asafa Powell run. He is amazing. \"He wastes no motion. If I can learn how to move down the track in one direction instead of all this rattling around, my 60m time will be ridiculous. I'm already the first amputee to go sub-seven. I went to 6.9sec last year, so I feel I can even go faster in Glasgow.\" Browne's only disappointment is that his arch-nemesis Jonnie Peacock will not be there, having suffered a minorniggle in training. But he knows there will be other times, and more important duels. \"The thing about Jonnie and I is that we're both so young,\" says Browne. \"He's only 20, and I'm 22, so we'll be doing this going into Rio and possibly on into Tokyo. It's going to be a fun few years.\" Browne is one of the star attractions of Saturday's meeting which sees a British team take on Scotland, the US and a Commonwealth Select squad. Also competing are the Olympic long jump champion, Greg Rutherford, the high jump bronze medallist Robbie Grabarz and the world 100m finalist James Dasaolu. But while Browne praises British athletics for being bold enough to include able-bodied athletes and Paralympians on the same bill, he feels that the IAAF attitude to Paralympians competing in the Olympics needs clarifying. \"The IAAF made the comment that there's 150 people who ran faster than my world record,\" he says. \"But we're going to see times this year that are going to make people change their minds about what is possible in amputee sprinting, whether it's me, or Alan Oliveira or Jonnie going 10.5, 10.4 or even 10.2 sec. I think IAAF need to get together and get their rules ready for 2016 because, trust me, we are coming.\" Few doubt that. It's just a question of how quickly they arrive. Last year Browne took nearly three-tenths off his 100m PB while Oliveira, the fastest man in the T43 category for double amputees, ran 10.57sec for the 100m and 20.6sec for the 200m. Oliveira's progress, in particular, has led one prominent sport scientist to predict the Brazilian could win a medal in the 400m in Rio. But while some are concerned that Oliveira gains too much of an advantage because, as a double amputee, his blades give him extra spring and power, Browne is not overly concerned. \"I don't care if you have one leg, two legs, three legs, four legs \u2013 running is running,\" he says. \"I have to drive my knees and pump my legs with as much force as Usain Bolt, Justin Gatlin or anybody else who is an elite sprinter. Over longer distances Paralympians have an advantage, but not in the sprints.\" Gatlin was one of the stars, along with Michael Phelps and Lolo Jones, that Browne met when the US Olympic and Paralympic teams visited the White House after London 2012. At the time Browne was shocked that they knew his name. Come Rio, he expects everyone will.
