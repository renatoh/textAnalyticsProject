Nicky Campbell, the Radio 5 Live broadcaster, former host of BBC's Watchdog and presenter of \"faith and ethics\" TV show The Big Questions, has written an album of big-band music called Moonlight's Back In Style. The 14 songs on the record are all in the cool swing vein of Frank Sinatra when he worked with orchestrator/arranger Nelson Riddle, and they are crooned by Holby City actor Mark Moraghan as slickly as someone who has just spent the weekend hanging out with Sammy and Dean at the Mocambo. What possessed Campbell, the combative veteran of current affairs programmes, to want to join the likes of Robbie Williams \u2013 who released the album Swing When You're Winning in 2001 \u2013 in the ranks of wannabe Rat Packers? According to Campbell, he has been writing songs since he was 11 and it has long been his ambition to record a swing album. Even weirder, however, is that the theme of the record is the male menopause. \"The whole concept is driven by mid-life crisis, and the desperate desire to do something else,\" explains Campbell, who in between hot flushes added backing vocals and played the ukulele on a number of tracks. He adds in the album's sleevenotes, \"I love that nexus between testosterone and tenderness.\" Campbell does have some form in this area. He started out writing jingles for radio, and in 2006 he appeared in BBC1's celebrity duets show Just the Two of Us alongside Beverley Knight. Nor is it the only unexpected foray into pop songwriting by a household name: Nick Hornby, author of High Fidelity and Fever Pitch, has just announced that he will be penning lyrics for American piano-pop performer Ben Folds. And at least Campbell brings some wry humour to the project: there are references throughout Moonlight's Back In Style to everything from satellite navigation systems to Kylie Minogue. Meanwhile, expect less testosterone than tenderness in his next confrontation with David Cameron."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
