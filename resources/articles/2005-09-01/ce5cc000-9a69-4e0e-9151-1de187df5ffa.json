North Korea's announcement that it is foregoing nuclear weapons is welcome, though other extremely important details remain to be agreed. But Iran's determination to press ahead with its quest for nuclear power - it insists it is not seeking weapons - is deeply worrying, not least because it is far from clear that the international community can come up with a response that will not escalate into a dangerous crisis. Yesterday's declaration follows February's admission by Kim Jong-il's \"Hermit Kingdom\" that it did indeed have nuclear weapons - a worrying moment in a decade-long game to enhance its own bargaining position and attract desperately needed aid to help feed its starving people. The key fact now, after a marathon round of talks ably hosted by China, is Pyongyang's readiness to return to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), the cornerstone of global disarmament efforts. That means that North Korea's nuclear facilities, recently seen only from US spy satellites, should again be open to on-the-ground inspections by the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA - whose dedicated experts should have been allowed to continue their work in Iraq but were marginalised in the drift to war. But that is still likely to be hostage to agreement by the US to supply a light-water reactor for civilian power generation. Caution is therefore in order. The talks in Beijing, with China, Japan and Russia also involved, have been punctuated by brinkmanship, walk-outs and threats - most recently by the chief US negotiator. Indeed, this breakthrough may have come because Washington warned it would go to the UN security council and seek sanctions, which North Korea had insisted would be tantamount to war. The key to success will be implementation. But the development does underline one important and positive lesson: dialogue on arms control can succeed. It is a victory for those in the Bush administration who toned down the president's \"axis of evil\" rhetoric, argued for engagement rather than isolation, for carrots as well as sticks - and a defeat for those hawks who insisted that Pyongyang could not be trusted. Unfortunately, the latest chapter in the Iranian nuclear saga seems to show that engagement does not always work. Saturday's defiant address to the UN by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad confirmed the fears of those who had warned that the diplomatic route was leading nowhere slowly. Iran has spurned the EU's offer of civilian nuclear technology and other economic and political incentives. It has hinted it might follow North Korea's example and leave the NPT if it is not allowed to develop civil nuclear power - as the treaty permits. The difficulty is the legacy of mistrust and the highly politicised nature of the debate after years of clandestine efforts by Iran to build weapons. The possibility that the IAEA will soon recommend that Tehran be referred to the security council risks a bitterly divisive debate about sanctions - and what happens if sanctions fail. It is worth repeating that North Korea and Iran would both have less of a case, and much less ability to cause trouble, if the world's five \"official\" nuclear powers, led by an instinctively unilateralist United States, had done more to meet their own NPT obligations to move towards disarmament, and did not tolerate nuclear-armed Israel, India and Pakistan outside the treaty. Britain, leading Europe's \"big three\", needs to take that message on board as the government considers a multi-billion pound replacement for its Trident missile system. Even so, the double standards of western democracies should not mean carte blanche for nuclear proliferators elsewhere, especially if they are undemocratic regimes like North Korea and Iran. These are explosive issues and need to be handled with extreme care."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
