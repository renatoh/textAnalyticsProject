The move ended a seven-week hiatus caused by the toppling of Omar Karami's Syrian-backed government in the face of mass protests over the assassination of Lebanon's former prime minister Rafik Hariri - a killing widely blamed on Syria or its supporters. Until last week Mr Karami had been trying to assemble a new cabinet, but opposition supporters accused him of stalling to delay the elections. Mr Mikati is a 49-year-old telecommunications millionaire and a political rival of Mr Karami. Though he has business interests in Syria and is a friend of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, he is viewed by many in the Lebanese opposition as a more conciliatory figure than his predecessor. Yesterday he told reporters that he agreed with one of the opposition's key demands - the resignation of Lebanon's pro-Syrian security chiefs. \"I will relay my point of view to the cabinet ... and I promise that it will agree with me,\" he said. Mr Mikati's 14-member cabinet consists of a mixed group of politicians, none of whom will be standing in the forthcoming elections, he added. The new government now has 10 days to win a vote of confidence in the parliament and secure approval for an electoral law if the polls are to be held before the parliament's term expires on May 31."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
