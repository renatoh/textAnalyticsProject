In parts of the UK sudden downpours caused localised flash floods, sometimes in as little as 20 minutes. Downpours have always been a feature of British weather, but hydrologists are concerned that they are becoming more frequent and heavier. The result is that drains built for \"normal\" conditions are unable to cope. In order to design new storm drains, sewers and run-offs in urban areas that will not be overwhelmed, engineers need to measure the intensity of these downpours, but this is proving a difficult task. There are many \"rain intensity gauges\" that measure rain over a short period. The World Meteorological Organisation has tested dozens of them and not found any of them to be accurate. The best appear to be those that measure and record the amount of rain by weight over a relatively short time before automatically emptying and starting again. The weight of water is converted into volume but all sorts of variables - including wind speed, temperature, humidity, and even the size of drops mixed with hail - combine to throw delicate measuring devices off balance. Testing two identical gauges side by side, even those thought to be the most accurate gave different results in the same rain storm, some by as much as 20%. This leaves engineers still puzzling how to obtain accurate maximum flow data on which to base new designs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
