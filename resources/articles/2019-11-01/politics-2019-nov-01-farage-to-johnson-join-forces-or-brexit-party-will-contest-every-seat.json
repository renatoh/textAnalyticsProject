After a rocky 48 hours, which saw Johnson booed during a hospital visit and urged by Donald Trump to join forces with Farage, the Brexit party leader urged him to strike a \u201cleave alliance\u201d. Launching the Brexit party\u2019s campaign in Westminster, the former Ukip leader claimed the deal agreed by Johnson in Brussels last month was \u201cnot Brexit\u201d. Farage said his message for the prime minister was: \u201cDrop the deal because as these weeks go by and people realise what you\u2019ve signed up to \u2026 people will not like it. \u201cSimply, it is not Brexit. What we\u2019re doing here is kicking the can down the road.\u201d He suggested the Brexit party would be prepared to stand aside in a swath of seats \u2013 but only if Johnson axes his own withdrawal agreement. In response the prime minister flatly rejected the idea of any electoral pact on Friday evening, saying a vote for any other party risked a Labour victory on 12 December. \u201cThe advantage of our deal is it\u2019s oven-ready, it\u2019s there to go, you put it in, come back in the middle of December, and we get it done and Brexit is over the line,\u201d he told the BBC. Pressed about whether he would be prepared to strike any kind of deal with Farage, he said: \u201cNow the difficulty about doing deals with any other party is that any other party, I\u2019m afraid, simply risks putting Jeremy Corbyn into No 10.\u201d Johnson\u2019s strategy for winning five more years in Downing Street is based on reuniting the leave vote that splintered between the Tories and the Brexit party in the European elections in May, by showing that he\u2019s the man to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. However, that task could become significantly more difficult amid a Farage tour of the country saying Johnson\u2019s deal is \u201cnot Brexit\u201d. In May, Farage\u2019s party topped the poll taking 31.6% of the vote against the Tories\u2019 9.1%. Elections analyst Chris Hanretty, professor of politics at Royal Holloway, University of London, said: \u201cIt\u2019s really quite straightforward \u2013 where the Brexit party stand they hurt the Conservatives much more than they hurt Labour.\u201d Farage castigated politicians\u2019 \u201cbroken promises\u201d at his campaign launch \u2013 including the prime minister\u2019s \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to leave the EU on 31 October. His speech followed Trump\u2019s intervention on Thursday, with the US president suggesting to Farage on his LBC radio show that he and Johnson could form an \u201cunstoppable force\u201d. Trump also claimed Corbyn would be \u201cso bad for your country\u201d \u2013 and suggested the US \u201ccan\u2019t make a trade deal with the UK\u201d under \u201ccertain aspects of the [Brexit] deal\u201d, despite Johnson\u2019s claims it would enable the UK to have an independent trade policy. Farage said his party wanted a \u201cclean Brexit\u201d, essentially a form of no deal whereby the country would move on to World Trade Organization terms until it negotiated a free-trade agreement with the EU. He said he was preparing to put up candidates across Britain, but was open to negotiation \u2013 and gave Johnson until 14 November to take up his offer. Farage said there were 150 seats that the Brexit party want to target in northern England, Wales, the Midlands and potentially east London \u2013 areas the Tories traditionally cannot reach. He said informal conversations about cooperating were already happening at a grassroots level in constituencies \u2013 and claimed he had discussed the possibility of a pact with officials in Downing Street, and at least one minister. \u201cOf course I\u2019m open and flexible to local exceptions and already we are in communication with a number of MPs who are prepared to renounce the withdrawal agreement, to renounce the deal, and they themselves to stand on a ticket of a genuine free trade agreement or leave on WTO terms,\u201d he said. However, most analysts suggest the impact of cutting tariffs would be likely to be outweighed by the costs of losing frictionless access to EU markets. Much of Farage\u2019s campaign launch speech argued that Johnson\u2019s deal was not a \u201ctrue Brexit\u201d because of what he claimed was the continued regulatory alignment with the EU, three further years of negotiation and abiding by terms set out by Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator. A delay to Brexit was also preferable over Johnson\u2019s deal, Farage suggested, saying the prime minister should decide to back a genuine free-trade deal such as the Canadian model, with no political ties, and give a 1 July deadline to the EU for this to be accepted. Farage reserved some of his most stinging criticism for Corbyn\u2019s party, in a sign the Brexit party is ramping up its campaign against Labour\u2019s remain-backing MPs in leave-voting areas. Asked how Labour voters would benefit from WTO terms and free-trade deals and the deregulation that comes with it, he said: \u201cCheaper food, cheaper bras, cheaper shows, cheaper everything \u2013 12,500 everyday household goods that we buy \u2013 everything from underwear to shoes to food that are tariffed because of the common external tariff and our membership of the European Union.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
