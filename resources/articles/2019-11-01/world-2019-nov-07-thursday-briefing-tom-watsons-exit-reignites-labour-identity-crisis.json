As we head towards 12 December there will be more and more election news, so the briefing will reflect that. You can consider this your jumping off point for our daily live coverage. And we will continue to bring you a taste of the rest of the news from the UK and beyond. What\u2019s going on? The debate about the direction of the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn looks set to kick off again after Tom Watson announced last night that he will step down as deputy leader. Watson \u2013 who has spent 35 years in full-time politics, and has represented West Bromwich East as its MP since 2001 \u2013 has repeatedly clashed with Corbyn, including over the Labour leader\u2019s Brexit stance and handling of antisemitism. One senior Labour figure said Watson\u2019s announcement had led to \u201ca great sense of desolation and abandonment sweeping the moderates\u201d in the party. Watson insisted his resignation was \u201cpersonal, not political\u201d and said he would \u201cspend this election fighting for brilliant Labour candidates and a better future for our country\u201d. Corbyn thanked Watson, saying: \u201cFew people have given as much to the Labour movement as you have.\u201d For his part Watson says he has a lot of irons in the fire, including training to become a gym instructor and a book about weight loss coming out in January. Boris Johnson has kicked off the Conservative election campaign with a speech in Birmingham that he hopes will give his party some positive momentum after a series of damaging gaffes in recent days. These include Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s suggestion that victims of the Grenfell Tower fire lacked common sense and Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary, having to resign over his knowledge of a former aide\u2019s role in allegedly sabotaging a rape trial. Johnson came out swinging at Corbyn, whom he accused of planning tax rises to fund \u201cderanged\u201d nationalism; at parliament, which he said was \u201cparalysed, blocked, generally incapable of digestive function, as an anaconda that has swallowed a tapir\u201d; and without naming him, at Nigel Farage, as the Brexit party leader has refused requests from pro-leave Tories to stand down Brexit party candidates in their seats. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the barricades,\u201d Johnson told supporters. At a glance Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens have agreed to a plan to step aside for each other in 60 seats in England and Wales, to give a free run to one pro-remain party in each constituency. The Liberal Democrats have defended themselves against accusations they are distributing \u201cmisleading and irresponsible\u201d election leaflets that misrepresent newspaper reports, including a quote from leader Jo Swinson in the Guardian, as endorsements of the party. Experts have hit out at the government for refusing to publish a report into Russian infiltration of British politics, saying Downing Street is ignoring evidence of Russian interference in the Brexit referendum. Tom Watson has been lauded as an \u201cimmovable force of Labour politics\u201d \u2013 see his career in pictures here. The day ahead Sajid Javid and his Labour shadow, John McDonnell, are both set to give speeches in the north-west of England this morning. Javid is expected to hammer Labour on the economy, while McDonnell will announce a \u00a3100bn \u201csocial transformation fund\u201d to \u201crepair the fabric that the Tories have torn apart\u201d. At 10am the Scottish Liberal Democrats will launch their election campaign. Boris Johnson is on a whirlwind trip around the north-east, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Jeremy Corbyn will speak at a rally in Manchester at 7.30pm. Best of the rest &gt; In the Trump-Ukraine scandal: the US president demanded his Kyiv counterpart \u201cgo to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference\u201d, a top diplomat has testified. &gt; Two ex-Twitter employees have been charged with spying for allegedly obtaining account details of critics of the Saudi regime. The FBI says targets included Omar Abdulaziz, a peer of Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist killed by the Saudi government. &gt; John Lewis says its trucks will run on carbon-neutral cow manure methane by 2021. Heineken is ditching plastic \u201ctoppers\u201d on multipacks of beer and replacing them with cardboard. \u201cClimate strike\u201d is the Collins Dictionary\u2019s word of the year. Today in Focus podcast: Online dirty tricks of the election The Guardian\u2019s media editor, Jim Waterson, tells Anushka Asthana how political parties are pushing the limits of what is allowed in the unregulated space of social media. Plus: Sabine Rennefanz on the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Lunchtime read: Who is the real Dice Man? A search for the mysterious author of a counterculture classic led to someone else entirely. Or did it? Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re on the hunt for the elusive writer behind a disturbing cult novel. Sport Manchester City held on for a 1-1 draw against Atalanta after an injury to Ederson and a red card to substitute goalkeeper Claudio Bravo forced defender Kyle Walker to go in goal for the final 10 minutes at the San Siro. Elsewhere in the Champions League, two goals from Son Heung-min and one each from Giovani Lo Celso and Christian Eriksen gave Tottenham a comfortable 4-0 victory at Red Star Belgrade, but Arsenal were pegged back in their Europa League clash with Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es following Bruno Duarte\u2019s stoppage-time scissor-kick. Saracens face a \u00a350,000 fine after failing to turn up for the launch of the European Champions Cup in Cardiff where, as holders, they would have had prime billing. England are likely to recall Jonny Bairstow and Chris Jordan to help them save the T20 series against New Zealand in Napier but Tom Banton and Matt Parkinson are set for another chance. Racing\u2019s ruling body is mulling over plans to tighten up its regulation of syndicates, a hot topic in the wake of the drama around the Irish-based Supreme Horse Racing Club, which is unable to run its horses. Nicola Adams, the Yorkshire boxer who has announced her retirement, forged her star quality with a mix of ruthlessness in the ring and kindness and optimism outside it. And Liverpool\u2019s Sadio Man\u00e9 has acknowledged Pep Guardiola\u2019s claim that his diving means the spotlight will be on him against Manchester City on Sunday but admitted he would \u201cdive again\u201d if it resulted in a penalty being awarded. Business After Marks &amp; Spencer reported a slump in clothing sales, our City commentator, Nils Pratley, casts a sceptical eye over the numbers and warns that its chief executive, Steve Rowe, is running out of time to fix the deep-seated problems in the retailer\u2019s fashion offer. On the markets, activity in Asia was subdued overnight as investors awaited more details on a possible US-China trade deal (we\u2019ve heard that one before though). That means the FTSE100 is set to open fairly flat while the pound is on $1.285 and \u20ac1.161. The papers The departure of Labour\u2019s un-Corbynite deputy leader is the splash on the front page of the Guardian, which says the resignation takes place as \u201cCorbyn strengthens grip\u201d over the party ahead of the election. The story also leads the Telegraph \u2013 \u201cWatson quits Commons\u201d \u2013 which says Corbyn\u2019s campaign is at risk of \u201csliding into chaos\u201d if other moderate MPs follow. The Times goes very literal: \u201cWatson quits as deputy leader of Labour party\u201d, and cites his clashes with Corbyn as well as the \u201cVIP sex case fiasco\u201d surrounding the lies of Carl Beech. The i says Labour has been left \u201cstunned as Watson quits\u201d. The Mail calls it all an \u201celection calamity\u201d for Corbyn and says: \u201cThree years of infighting has left Mr Watson isolated as Labour\u2019s last senior moderate.\u201d The Mirror puts \u201cWatson quit shock\u201d in a skybox but its lead story takes a positive line on Labour\u2019s election campaign: \u201cPower to the north\u201d as the shadow treasurer, John McDonnell, pledged to \u201cpump $150bn\u201d into the regions. The FT has \u201cLabour\u2019s vow to take borrowing to \u00a3400bn fires spending battle\u201d. The Express leads with Boris Johnson\u2019s campaign launch entreaty to \u201cCome with us or get horror show\u201d. The line feels dated \u2013 wasn\u2019t Halloween, like, a week ago? Lastly we have the Sun with \u201cKnifemen 0, Gunners 1\u201d with a video still of Arsenal footballer Sead Kola\u0161inac seeing off scooter thugs who were trying to rob him and Mesut \u00d6zil.
