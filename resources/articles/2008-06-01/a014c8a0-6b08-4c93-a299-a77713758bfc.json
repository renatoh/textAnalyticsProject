One of the Labour government agonies this summer is whether it should impose mayors \u2013 paradoxically seeking to make local government more accountable by demonstrating its servility to the centre. But so far mayors have not taken, despite the flush of media interest in the contest for mayor of London and the visits of the high profile mayor of New York to support Boris Johnson and the equally potent mayor of Paris to endorse Ken Livingstone. One reason might be the job's impossibility. World Mayor 2008, a non-profit project, specifies administrative abilities: a good mayor must be able to provide safety and security and protect the environment; and must be able to foster good relations between communities from different cultural, racial and social backgrounds. That spec illustrates the high expectations placed on mayors, which may be why a mere 13 English municipalities have opted to establish the office. Mayors, of course, are old hat. What Michael Heseltine, the former Tory minister and, after him, Tony Blair dreamt of was a powerful executive, imbued with ballot box authority. That concept also offers accountability. A single person, so the argument runs, is more visible, more likely to encourage participation. Turnout in Greater London at 45% in the May election was higher than in the council elections elsewhere in England and Wales, at 35%. But after an initial blip, mayoral elections, including those in London boroughs, have not produced evidence of greater public involvement. Local government's own advocates are not apparently convinced that mayors are more accountable in and of themselves. James Hulme has just written a paper for the New Local Government Network calling for the leaders of the London boroughs, most of them products of the normal procedures involving party caucuses, to scrutinise the London mayor, making the office more accountable to Londoners. The Institute for Public Policy Research, claims council performance has improved and local politics has been invigorated in authorities with mayors. They cite the results of one survey in which 48% of people in an authority with an elected mayor feel it is \"easier to find out who has made specific decisions\", compared with 40% in areas without a mayor. That is hardly conclusive. Guy Lodge and Michael Kenny want mayors in all major cities, including Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol and Nottingham. Birmingham infighting But we've been here before. The case for a directly elected mayor of a city region based on Birmingham has foundered amid political infighting between the authorities involved, with bitter rivalry between Birmingham, Coventry and the Black Country making it hard to create a coherent \"Greater Birmingham\". The idea has also foundered on widespread public indifference to the issue of an elected mayor. In March, the Birmingham Mail gave up a campaign to trigger a referendum on the topic, after collecting only 12,000 signatures on its petition: a mere third of the 36,000 signatures needed. On the other hand, in a successful city region like Greater Manchester, mechanisms are already in place that bring together separate parts of the region, while retaining their autonomy, so there is less perceived need for a mayor, and strong leadership exists in Sir Howard Bernstein, the chief executive of Manchester city council and Richard Leese, the council's leader. Robin Hambleton argues that having more elected mayors, without them having more financial powers, would merely result in \"featherweight\" mayors. Tell that to Jules Pipe, in Hackney, who has overseen the turnaround of his borough, from its parlous financial position in 1996. Hackney and Stoke-on-Trent have both improved their ratings since electing a mayor. So mayors can make some difference \u2013 but they remain political figures. Accountability is shared between them and councillors, who may well claim to speak for the public in a different ideological tenor.
