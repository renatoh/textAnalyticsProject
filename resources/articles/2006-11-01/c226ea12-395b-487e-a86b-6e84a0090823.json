The TV channel pulled the episode after the main contestant suffered a death in the family and had to attend a funeral. Every episode of the hit show, hosted by Noel Edmonds, is recorded in advance. Channel 4 informed viewers of the reason for the repeat with a caption at the end of the programme. \"The scheduled programme was replaced by a repeat today because of the personal circumstances of the contestant involved,\" a Channel 4 spokesman said. \"Our thoughts are with her and her family.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
