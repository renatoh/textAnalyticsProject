At least seven attackers took part in what national papers were already calling the \u201cheist of the century\u201d, which targeted the shipment of cash just hours after it was flown into the country. Two security guards were wounded during the robbery at Arturo Merino Benitez airport, 18km from the city centre. Two of the thieves were armed with shotguns and one with a rifle. Jorge S\u00e1nchez of Chile\u2019s investigative police told press that the gang is believed to have had inside information about the shipment. A string of ambushes on vehicles at or near the airport have been reported since police were deployed in October to confront demonstrations against social inequality and a rising cost of living. Officers have been accused of litany of serious human rights abuses against protesters, including torture, sexual violence and executions. And as police patrols have been stepped up around regular protest sites, other areas have been neglected. Ignacio D\u00edaz, who works for a shuttle service, said that attacks on vehicles heading to the airport had soared since the unrest broke out. \u201cThe roads are very exposed right now,\u201d he said, adding that one transport company had seen five vehicles stolen during a mass protest in January. \u201cThe criminal gangs are taking advantage of the situation.\u201d Monday\u2019s robbery comes six years after $10m (\u00a36.2m) was stolen from a security van at the airport in 2014. The airport\u2019s security chief was subsequently fired and officials said that the airport\u2019s security protocols would be revised. The latest robbery netted nearly twice as much money as the 2014 theft, making it one of the largest robberies in Chilean history. Karla Rubilar, a government spokesperson and former Santiago mayor, said in a statement: \u201cThere is enough evidence to allow us to make quick advances in the investigation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
