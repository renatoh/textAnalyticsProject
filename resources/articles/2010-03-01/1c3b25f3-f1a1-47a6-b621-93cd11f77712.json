This weekend's British Airways strike has been hyped far beyond its industrial significance. No government money or national interest is at stake. There are plenty of competitors for BA in the supply of airline services, and 80% of air travel is for leisure and tourism. What draws headlines is that the union involved, the Unite conglomerate, has given the Labour party \u00a311m over the past two years. It is far more important to Labour in the coming election than Lord Ashcroft is to the Tories. In a bizarre, traditional abuse of parliament, it is also allowed to have 100 MPs on its books and wields half the union votes in Labour's electoral college. Ministers are understandably concerned. There is no doubt of their point of view. The bushy-tailed transport secretary, Lord Adonis, did not nuance his words at the weekend with comments on BA's cabin crew. He said their strike was \"totally unjustified\" and \"absolutely deplorable\", not to mention damaging, disproportionate and a \"threat to the future of one of our great companies in this country\". Adonis has given his allegiance to both parties of the left and appears deftly bidding to remain in office should the Conservatives come to power. Yet Adonis was outshone by his boss. Gordon Brown is well aware of the ghosts stirred by labour disputes in the mind of the electorate. He needs no reincarnation of the horrors of 1978-9. What damaged Labour then \u2013 so historians maintain \u2013 was not so much the strikes of the winter of discontent as the appearance of a government floundering out of control. Brown clearly decided that infuriating Unite was the lesser of evils. He said the BA strike was \"at the wrong time, unjustified, deplorable and not in the national interest\". The BA strike is the culmination of a long campaign by the airline's aggressive boss, Willie Walsh, to rid the company of costs inherited from the dinosaur days of nationalisation 23 years ago. Then air travel was booming, the \"nation's flag carrier\" could do no wrong, and staff were employed and money spent recklessly. BA has taken almost a quarter-century to discover that big is lumbering, uncomfortable and anything but beautiful. The company inhabited a wonderland of gleaming offices, consultants, lobbyists, freebie trips and immaculate staff. The awfulness of its food and the uselessness of its headsets were concealed by the self-satisfaction of having once been \"the world's favourite airline\". Walsh arrived at BA in 2005 hot-foot from Aer Lingus, having reconfigured the national carrier into a cut-throat rival to Ryanair. He had risen to this job from the company's flight deck, where he had himself been a union negotiator. He knew where the cost skeletons were hidden. The result has been savings and industrial relations turmoil ever since. Clearly the future of BA depends on the outcome of a similar struggle. The company is now struggling to engineer a tie-up with Iberia and American Airlines, and is more likely to make a good bargain if it can cut its extravagant crewing. A year ago figures from the Civil Aviation Authority put BA's annual spending per head at \u00a330,000 per crew member, against \u00a318,400 for British Midlands and \u00a314,000 for Virgin Atlantic and Thomson. While this may not exactly compare like with like, no airline can live with such a gap for long. BA has reserves of some \u00a31.8bn but was, until recently, losing money and has yet to fund a \u00a33.7bn pension deficit. Were these the old days, ministers would summon both sides to Downing Street and plead with them to consider the public interest. The sides would then act their customary roles, refusing all compromise in the sure knowledge of what came next. On cue ministers would shower one and all with public money and declare \"a victory for common sense\". It was how they wrecked British industry from top to bottom in the 1970s. Today the government mercifully has no dog in the fight. Ministers are largely impotent. The yearning to intervene in any industrial dispute that appears on the front page may run deep in the British political gene, but BA is private. It is not reliant on state funds for its present or future operation. Walsh knows that, and the union knows that. Both have told ministers, in no uncertain terms, to shut up. That said, government is not without a role. It regulates the airlines' most treasured assets, runway capacity and take-off and landing slots, notably at the London airports. BA has spent years brazenly lobbying Whitehall to make sure its rivals are condemned to Gatwick and Stansted, while building seemingly new terminals and a third runway at its beloved Heathrow. There is not an MP or a journalist who has not been wined and dined in this unedifying process, with a liberal scattering of coveted Premier cards. When I once told a steward who was lobbying me about his conditions that I would pass it on to Walsh, he replied: \"You don't know Walsh, because if you did you wouldn't be travelling tourist.\" The campaign has been highly successful. Against overwhelming opposition \u2013 from Greenpeace to the Tory party \u2013 BA and its allies at the airport company BAA have had a firm ally in the campaign for a third Heathrow runway: Andrew Adonis's department. The two companies have hired lobbyists and championed the runway as one team. The proposed alliance with Iberia and American Airlines is intended to give BA at Heathrow well over half the profitable transatlantic slots \u2013 to the fury of Virgin Atlantic and other carriers. Such oligopolistic antics ought to be stopped by government rather than encouraged. Half the point of privatisation was to end subsidised inefficiency, but the other half was to promote and benefit from competition. If the BA strike becomes prolonged, the government's duty must be to reverse its favouritism towards that company and make it easier for rivals to offer a Heathrow service at lower cost. Brown should ensure that competition in air travel is alive and kicking. Ministers cannot run airline companies or, for that matter, perform as labour arbitrators and conciliators. What they can do is sustain the efficacy of markets and punish those who abuse them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
