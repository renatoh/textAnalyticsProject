Defeat against Besiktas on Wednesday would more or less end their hopes of qualifying for the knockout phase, while a draw may not be good enough, either. This, however, is not a particularly good time to be playing Besiktas. They, too, are desperate to claim their first win of the group stage and played extremely well against Porto in their last Champions League game. That they lost 1-0 to a late Ricardo Quaresma goal was difficult to take, considering their dominance, and Liverpool will face a team determined to make amends. 'We have only one option and that is to win,' said the president Yildirim Demiroren. 'If we play like we did against Porto then I think we have a good chance to beat Liverpool. Liverpool have a lot of players with experience in Europe but we are the home team and our fans will be behind us.' Demiroren is bankrolling the Istanbul club and is desperate to make an impact in Europe. After mixed results with high-profile coaches such as Vicente del Bosque and Jean Tigana, Demiroren decided to put his faith the 37-year-old Turkish coach Ertugrul Saglam this summer. The choice of Saglam, who played for Besiktas from 1994 to 2001, was met with scepticism in Turkey despite the fact that he had won promotion to the Super League with Kayserispor and qualified the unfancied side for Uefa Cup football last season. Saglam was too young, the critics said, and would not be able to deal with the pressure, but he is already on his way to prove them wrong. 'Being young is not a disadvantage for me,' he said after his appointment. 'Of course experience is a very important part of the job, but experience can be gained from every part of life. Perhaps a young coach who comes from outside the Besiktas community might face some difficulties but I played for this club for years and I really know it well. Youthfulness, dynamism and ambition will be my advantages.' Saglam does not have any superstars in his team - unlike rivals Fenerbahce, who bought Roberto Carlos in the summer, and Galatasaray - but relies on a host of players with a lot to prove. The veteran goalkeeper Rustu Recber, at 34, was deemed to be past his best and was offloaded by Fenerbahce in the summer, but has now been given a chance as Besiktas's first-choice keeper, Hakan Arikan, is injured. Edouard Cisse, who had an inauspicious loan spell with West Ham in 2002-03, runs the midfield and will have a crucial role against Liverpool as the Brazilian Ricardinho is injured. The key men, however, are up front and the Brazilians Bobo and Marcio Nobre have more to prove than most as Besiktas have scored only nine goals in eight league games this season. It is their worst start to a season as far as goals are concerned for over 20 years. The captain, Ibrahim Uzulmez, however, is not worried. 'As long as we are not conceding goals then we are OK. And we will be very motivated against Liverpool as we know that if we lose, our Champions League adventure is over for this time. So we have to show what we can do. It is a huge game and we know that this is our last chance.' So do Liverpool.
