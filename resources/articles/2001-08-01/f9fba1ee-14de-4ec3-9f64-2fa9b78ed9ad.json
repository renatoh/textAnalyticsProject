The resurgence of public enthusiasm for the game that followed the creation of the Premier League nine years ago shows no sign of waning. Attendances at more than a few clubs are limited only by ground capacities. A derelict Wembley may now lie across the north London skyline like a stranded whale, but clubs are still planning new stadiums. At the same time, reports of a recession and in particular falls in television advertising could portend a turbulent period for clubs that, for the most part, operate on the Micawber principle of something always turning up. Next week's annual review of football finance by the accountants Deloitte &amp; Touche is likely to reiterate past warnings about the consequences of the game mortgaging future television and sponsorship income in order to live for the present. Too many clubs spend too much on players' salaries, already inflated beyond reason, and by doing so widen the gulf between the Premiership and the rest, while making the cost of relegation ever more punitive. Nottingham Forest, champions and twice European Cup winners little more than 20 years ago, and a Premiership club until 1999, recently announced that their entire first-team squad was being put up for sale to cut the wages bill. Their plight should be heeded by those who may be joining them in the Nationwide before long. Clubs like Everton, for example, who have not only sold their best striker but have put another, 11 years his senior, on a four-year contract worth \u00a336,000 a week. What lunacy. Well may Goodison come to echo Robert E Sherwood's disillusioned anti-hero: \"I'm going to die in the petrified forest.\" Such moribund thoughts will not be allowed to poop the pre-season junket now in full swing. This is primarily a TV event designed to attract customers to a year-long series of football shows with live games at their heart. In TV's football world seldom is heard a discouraging word and the skies are not cloudy all day. Now that BBC's Match Of The Day, the medium's last bastion of candid comment, has been lost to the forces of commerce, the discerning viewer's best option will be the mute button and his or her independent judgment. All right, ITV will strike some sort of critical balance with Des and Tel. But when the FA Cup gets going in earnest, be sure that Beeb loyalists will turn to Links, Jockey, Lawro and Trev like parched nomads stumbling across an oasis. This season there will be more football on British television than ever before. Paradoxically, if Sven-Goran Eriksson's hopes of taking England to next summer's World Cup turn to dust, thus reducing the number of matches in the 2002 tournament available for the price of the TV licence, there will still not be enough for those unable or unwilling to fork out the extra on pay-TV. The onset of pay-per-view, still relatively unknown territory in terms of audience ratings, will provide a fresh and useful yardstick of how much life is left in the football boom. For those unable to get tickets for the big matches or simply priced out by the cost of taking the family to games on a regular basis, what is on offer seems a good deal. But fans, by definition, are one-clubbers, so the response is bound to be patchy. Those who complain there is too much football on television are missing the point, which is that to a large extent football is filling air time on channels specifically designed for this purpose. Anyone who watches BSkyB or the new ITV sports channel and then complains about saturation coverage will be like the man who, after visiting the royal ballet, complained that the show was spoilt by too much dancing. Television is football's extra blanket against the financial chill of players' salaries and the increasing cost of buying anyone who can make a half-decent pass. The amount of cash the TV companies are prepared to stump up for the privilege of covering games is a measure of their faith in the public's appetite for more. The degree to which clubs rely on television money is also a measure of their vulnerability. If there is a recession, the game's moneymen will need to give serious consideration to wage-capping as clubs relive the austere realities of the early 80s. For the moment, however, the party goes on and tomorrow's Charity Shield, though hardly a curtain-raiser in a show that never stops, ought to be a cocktail worth savouring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
