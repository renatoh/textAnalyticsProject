A series of Senate votes is expected to begin tomorrow morning and carry on in a final legislative heave that should see a healthcare bill clear the Senate on Christmas Eve. Passage through the Senate of reforms that have eluded the Democrats for generations and that will cover 30m uninsured Americans will be heralded by the Obama administration as the pinnacle of its first year in office. \"After nearly a century-long struggle, we are on the cusp of making health care reform a reality in the United States of America,\" Barack Obama said in a TV address from the White House. But the passage of the bill will not have been ensured without painful compromises that have caused dismay among leftwing Democrats. The Democratic leadership of the Senate was held to ransom by individual senators as every one of the 60 members who take the Democratic whip had to vote in favour of the bill if it were to avoid a Republican blocking tactic, the so-called filibuster. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, had already bowed to the will of the independent senator Joe Lieberman and dropped the public option \u2013 a government-run health insurance scheme \u2013 that was seen as crucial by liberal Democrats as a means of reigning in the all-powerful private health insurers. In 13 hours of dramatic negotiations on Friday, the Democratic leadership was forced to accept further whittling down of the bill at the hands of Bob Nelson, an outspoken anti-abortionist. Provoking a storm of protest from pro-abortion groups, Reid placated Nelson by introducing an amendment into the bill that would ensure that no federal money was spent subsidising abortions. A similar clause was included in the version of the reforms that pass through the House of Representatives. In the Senate model, anyone taking up insurance through the exchanges set up under the bill that would provide cheap government-subsidised packages for people who cannot get insurance through work can take up coverage that includes abortion but they must pay for the abortion element of it separately. Pro-abortion groups were livid. Cecile Richards, of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said: \"It is a sad day when women's health is traded away for one vote. [We] do not think that health care reform is the forum to litigate abortion policy.\" Naral Pro-Choice America, one of the country's largest abortion rights groups, said the compromise would place an unacceptable administrative burden on women buying abortion coverage. It added: \"This situation is a reminder that, despite our significant pro-choice gains in the last two election cycles, anti-choice lawmakers still outnumber our allies.\" David Axelrod, Obama's senior adviser, defend the compromise bill during television interviews today, saying it \"preserved the rights of women to chose, and doesn't change existing law one way or another\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
