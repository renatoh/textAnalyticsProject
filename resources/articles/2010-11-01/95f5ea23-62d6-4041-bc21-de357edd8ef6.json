Don't read on if you haven't seen episode four \u2013 and if you've seen future episodes, please be aware that many UK viewers have not. Anna Pickard's episode three blog Four episodes in now, and while crises are being averted, situations resolved and questions answered, the manner in which this is happening is so ludicrous that it might even stand a chance of winning a special award. It really is brilliant. \"A Matter of Life and Death\" Following immediately on from the events of last week, Sean and Agent Collier are discovered running from a mysterious trigger-happy thug intent on killing him, her and everyone else in the Yuma Arizona field office. Luckily they escape\u2013 unlike everyone else \u2013 and, once they've located some unpassword-protected Wi-Fi, Sean gets straight back on the case of locating Vicky and, through her, his beloved Leila. He discovers she pays the rent on a house in Lubbock, Texas. So they head off there, speedily arriving by the next scene (it is about 900 miles away). Leila, meanwhile, has been locked in a basement by evil Vicky but manages to escape by cutting through her rope, shooting Vicky with her own gun and then running away from the house. She happens upon a nearby policeman, who takes her to the station, makes her comfortable and lets her phone Sean. But wait! It is all a ruse. The whole thing has been set up by Vicky and her mystery bad-gang, in the hope of ensnaring Sean by letting Leila phone him. Yes, that's really what happened. The passengers \u2013 you remember the ones, they were dead and then they weren't again, but no one knows why \u2013 suddenly all start suffering from nosebleeds. As anyone who has seen a lot of House can tell you, bleeding from the nose is only the first symptom. It will most likely progress to bleeding of the bum, and then, almost-inevitable death. This illness, however, is caused by the marvelously evil Thomas \u2013 he's the member of Sofia's people that led the group infiltrating society, and who appears to have gone terribly rogue in the meantime. The events of the Event The leaps of logic contained in this episode are brilliant to behold. Is taking over an entire police station, killing everyone in it and planting one fake policeman on the street really the best way to deal with Leila's escape plan? What if she happened to run the other way? What if she didn't meet the right cop? And if it's all just a ruse to get her to contact Sean and bring him to them, why not just kidnap him in the first place? On the cruise ship? At least we've learned why Sean is so expert at cracking FBI mainframes and super-secret profiling databases and whatnot. He \"writes some code and works on computer games and stuff\" for a living. It is reassuring to know that in this age, \"and stuff\" is still enough to add weight and mystery to a job description. Certainly it explains why Sean is suddenly able to remotely hack the same profiling search program that he could only previously access via an FBI mainframe. Oh, no, wait: it doesn't. Most intriguing moment? Sofia's slow, measured manner of speaking. Is that supposed to suggest English as a second language? Or just that she's very measured and clever? Whatever the case, Thomas is just as measured, but in more of an openly evil way. He's missing a mistake not having a moustache though. And maybe a cane? Yes. Definitely a cane. Next week Will Sean and Leila reunite? Will Thomas grow the moustache he so richly deserves? Will the nosebleeding lead to an unpleasant next symptom? And will we ever find out how Sean got from a cruise ship to hijacking a plane in Miami? Tune in next week to find out!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
