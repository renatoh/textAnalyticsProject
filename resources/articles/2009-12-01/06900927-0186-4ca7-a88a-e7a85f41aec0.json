Peter Pan can be seen as a play, a musical, a ballet and, in at least 20 towns and cities from Sunderland to Shrewsbury, as a pantomime. The London version of Peter Pan was one of the theatrical successes of the summer when it opened in a tent \u2013 for the first time \u2013 in the place where JM Barrie set it: Kensington Gardens. It has now been transported to the O2 where it will play until 6 January before being shipped 6,000 miles to San Francisco. This Peter Pan is a visual treat with tons of flying and the wow factor with its 360-degree computer-generated effect backdrop. It is also a long way from the pared down, lo-fi Newcastle version, a fact undisputed by its director Erica Whyman, who wants the audience to use its own imagination. \"We decided to try and completely confound the idea that it would be anything like a Disney film or a panto,\" she said. \"You can't escape the fact you are sitting in a theatre so you have to keep choosing to believe,\" she said. \"Children are much better at doing that than adults.\" For Whyman, artistic director of Northern Stage, one reason Peter Pan resonates this year is the economy. \"For us, it was about the recession. Peter Pan is essentially about fantasy and escape and about childhood. It's about Christmas being seen as a time for imagination.\" Whyman said they had wanted to steer away from bright shiny panto. \"We very deliberately decided to limit the props and the setpieces. The children tell the story with the things they have in their bedroom. \"It's more of a challenge to the grownups in the audience and remember, JM Barrie had no time for grown-ups.\" Peter Pan also taps into consumerist themes. You don't need expensive things to have fun: use your imagination and you're having pirate fights or swimming with mermaids. Whyman said: \"Barrie is constantly saying: if you believe we are going to Neverland then we will, if you believe that we are in Neverland then we are and if you don't then you're a boring grown-up and you're missing out.\" Through little fault of its own, the London Peter Pan feels like it is in the valley of all things consumerist. You get to the tent by walking along the terracotta brick road of the O2's string of bars and bistros. When you arrive, there are shimmering skyscrapers overlooking you with their neon signs. The show, however, is not an overpowering CGI spectacular \u2013 the actors and the story are very much at the centre of it. \"Spectacle was not the main thrust for us,\" said producer Charlie Burrell. \"Our starting point was wanting to take a classic family story and tell it in a landmark location as well as we possibly could.\" Burrell believes Peter Pan has a timeless appeal. \"It appealed because it is just such a happy story and during the summer there was a backdrop of such doom and gloom and bad news. That's why audiences came in the first place.\" Both Peter Pans are getting very good audiences and Burrell said the move to America was already attracting a lot of interest, with more than $1.3m (\u00a3804m) of advanced bookings in just three weeks. \"The Americans are going bananas for it. They've welcomed us with open arms,\" he said. The interest in Peter Pan, meanwhile, is likely to continue as 2010 will be the 150th anniversary of Barrie's birth. Peter Pan himself will return in a big new production being planned by the National Theatre of Scotland in an adaptation by playwright David Greig, to be directed by John Tiffany, of Black Watch fame. The Newcastle and London versions are different in many ways\u2013 at Northern Stage you only have to clap if you believe in fairies whereas at the O2 you have to whisper building up to a yell \u2013 but they both remain faithful to the Barrie story and as Whyman points out, there's nothing to say Peter or the Lost Boys can't be from Teesside. Both productions succeed in holding the toughest of audiences, children, and both were rapturously received. Whyman said: \"We're very conscious that this might be the only time of the year when parents or grandparents come to the theatre with their children so we have a responsibility.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
