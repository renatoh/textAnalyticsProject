The program was announced in May\u2019s budget and was funded by the redistribution of $104.7m previously allocated to the Australia Council. The 10-page document sets out the program\u2019s aim to \u201cstrengthen Australia\u2019s reputation as a sophisticated and artistic nation\u201d, laying out the key criteria arts organisations must satisfy to make a successful funding application. Projects must be \u201chigh quality\u201d, with proven value for money and evidence of audience demand, the guidelines state. Private funding is also essential for a project to gain support. Funding will be allocated on an \u201copen and competitive basis\u201d across three streams from an annual pot of \u201capproximately $20m\u201d over the next four financial years, subject to the availability of funds. \u201cThe final amount of any funding and length of funding term will be assessed by the Ministry for the Arts and independent assessors. Recommendations will then be made to the minister for the arts.\u201d The reallocation of the $104.7m was met with widespread concern across the sector when it was announced in the budget. Arts leaders criticised the lack of open consultation and the late cancellation of the Australia Council\u2019s next six-year funding round that left many organisations uncertain of their future. With $80m budgeted for the first four years of the program, it is unclear how the remaining $24.7m budgeted for Brandis\u2019s funding changes will be used. The removal of the arms-length funding principle has been the subject of several open letters and a successful motion for a Senate inquiry into the new arrangements, supported by the Greens and Labor party as well as all eight crossbench senators. At a meeting in Canberra the shadow arts minister, Mark Dreyfus, labelled Brandis\u2019s program a \u201cslush fund\u201d. The National Program for Excellence in the Arts guidelines outline the program\u2019s aims to deliver \u201ca wide range of quality arts and cultural experiences that grow arts audiences, throughout Australia and internationally\u201d, and to encourage greater private sector support. Successful projects must prove audience appeal and demand to receive funding. The guidelines suggest applications include written supporting material such as venue confirmations or an invitation to perform or exhibit, a request that could prove hard to meet for independent companies with work in development. The guidelines also say: \u201cFunding will be conditional on organisations leveraging funds from other sources to realise projects. Organisations will need to demonstrate evidence of financial, cash or in-kind support from sources other than the Australian government.\u201d This echoes the letter Brandis wrote to the Australia Council in March 2014, asking for a policy to penalise organisations that refused arts funding from corporate sponsors on \u201cunreasonable grounds\u201d. Applications will be assessed and ranked by a team of at least three people, comprising of ministry representatives and independent assessors. As yet undisclosed measures will seek to ensure \u201can appropriate mix across art forms\u201d and between regional, urban and international projects.The ministry may \u201cmoderate assessments\u201d to ensure that program and government policy objectives are met. Successful applicants will be publicly listed in the Ministry for the Arts grants register, unless the minister obtains an exemption in accordance with the Commonwealth Grant Rules and Guidelines. Brandis may apply for exemption \u201cwhere officials assess that publishing grant information in accordance with the CGRGs could adversely affect the achievement of government policy outcomes.\u201d Guardian Australia contacted Brandis\u2019s office seeking details of who was consulted over the draft guidelines and how the full $104.7m reallocated from the Australian Council would be used. Brandis\u2019s office replied but did not answer either question, saying only that \u201cthe transfer of $104.8m over four years to the Ministry for the Arts from the Australia Council will support the National Program for Excellence in the Arts as well as the transfer of the Visions of Australia and Festivals Australia programs and the Major Festivals Initiative back to the Ministry for the Arts.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
