But it was the breeze stirring this large insect, whose wingspan was at least 7cm and not far short of the length of a goldcrest, our smallest bird. One antenna, fixed in rigor mortis, was wrapped round the luxurious mouse-grey \"fur\" that coated the thorax almost as thickly as on a mammal. The brownish feeler then snaked down the underside almost to the abdomen. It had a strange structure with lines of tiny hairs, like a millipede's legs, and initially it seemed so distinctive that I mistook it for a separate worm-like animal. Then I realised they were equally inanimate, and I began to wonder what sensations of our shared world were provided by these long curving horn-like radars. This evening my daughter brought me another moth, this one no more inconvenienced than its few minutes in an upturned tumbler. It was smaller than the poplar hawk but no less beautiful. The thorax was an intense saffron yellow pierced by two large black eyes, while the ragged-edged wings were the tannin brown of a dried oak leaf incised by double black lines. It was a canary-shouldered thorn and as I scanned its close relatives in the book - september thorn, clouded august thorn, lunar and purple thorns - I reflected on those lucky beings who first named the many thousands of moth species. Those entomologists found just the right words to summon in each short title some of the mystery and beauty that these remarkable creatures evoke. \u00b7 Birds Britannica by Mark Cocker (Chatto &amp; Windus, \u00a335) is published on Sep 1"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
