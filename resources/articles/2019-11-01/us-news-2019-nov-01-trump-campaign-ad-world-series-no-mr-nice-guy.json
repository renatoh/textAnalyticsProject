However, the ad has been greeted mostly with grudging praise even from some Democrats as an effective harbinger of the likely message Trump\u2019s campaign will hone in the coming 2020 presidential election. David Plouffe, former campaign manager for Barack Obama, tweeted: \u201cDonald Trump ad that just ran during World Series was quite strong. National TV ads in October of off year \u2013 unprecedented.\u201d Michael Cornfield, an associate professor of political management at George Washington University, added: \u201cMen of action don\u2019t have time for niceties like facts and rules. And neither do 30-second ads. Effective angle for any incumbent \u2013 even this one.\u201d The ad is hardly subtle. \u201cObliterating Isis,\u201d says a male narrator, as the commercial shows an already famous photo of Trump as commander-in-chief, with the vice-president, Mike Pence, and his national security team, in the situation room watching the raid that killed the group\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. This is followed by footage of military explosions and a picture of Baghdadi being crossed out in red. There is a swipe to the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who is masterminding the impeachment inquiry against Trump, followed by Adam Schiff, chair of the House intelligence committee, and former special counsel Robert Mueller \u2013 all set to be portrayed as villains in the campaign narrative. The narrator continues: \u201cTheir caliphate destroyed. Their terrorist leader dead. But the Democrats would rather focus on impeachment and phony investigations, ignoring the real issues. But that\u2019s not stopping Donald Trump.\u201d It adds: \u201cHe\u2019s no Mr Nice Guy, but sometimes it takes a Donald Trump to change Washington.\u201d The final line could be seen as a nod to those conservatives who say they are not always fans of Trump\u2019s style, especially his use of Twitter, but who embrace his policy agenda. It also recognises Trump\u2019s popularity among a base who complained that politicians were all the same until his insurgent candidacy. Democrats responded with a fact check: \u201cCLAIM: Trump created 6 million new jobs. THE TRUTH: that\u2019s a million fewer jobs than President Obama created during the equivalent time period.\u201d It concluded: \u201cCLAIM: Trump\u2019s no Mr Nice Guy. THE TRUTH: they can have this one.\u201d The Trump campaign reportedly spent a seven-figure sum to run the ad during the deciding game of baseball\u2019s World Series on Wednesday night \u2013 more than a year before election day. The commercial is based on a previous ad but has been updated to include the killing of Baghdadi. CNN reported that Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said it was made the same day it aired. Baseball fans watching a big screen at the Washington Nationals\u2019 stadium on Wednesday reportedly greeted it with boos."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
