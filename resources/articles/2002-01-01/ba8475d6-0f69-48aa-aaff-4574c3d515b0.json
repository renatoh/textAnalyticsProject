Five successive defeats have tested the board's patience, which had been expected to snap if Smith's side lost to their Second Division opponents. However, in a show of support that could yet prove to be a stay of execution, the Merseyside club's deputy-chairman Bill Kenwright and chief executive Michael Dunford pledged to provide Smith with funds to beef up his squad. Everton, \u00a318m in the red, have agreed a refinancing package and are believed to be borrowing up to \u00a312m. Around \u00a32m is believed to have been earmarked for investment in a new academy, while another \u00a31m is to be spent on the Bellefield training complex. That would leave up to \u00a39m to invest with a striker - possibly Brighton's Bobby Zamora - and a midfielder to replace the out-of-favour Thomas Gravesen, Smith's priorities. \"The board would reaffirm that they are entirely committed to see Everton return to compete with those at the top of the Premier League,\" said Kenwright in a statement. \"To this end, a refinancing package has been negotiated and agreed, giving the club a long-term opportunity to consolidate its ambitions. \"Budgets are currently being finalised and will allow the manager funds to develop his first-team squad and consolidate it with long-term ambition for the youth academy.\" Smith - who will be without eight regulars today though Paul Gascoigne is fit - has found support easier to come by among his squad than on the terraces. David Weir, Kevin Campbell, Steve Watson, Abel Xavier and Gascoigne have all publicly backed the manager. \"That means something to me,\" said Smith. \"The board's statement is appreciated and has been noted. Confidence may be down a little, but I don't believe it has dropped to any great degree. I repeat that, apart from the past few weeks, we have not done at all badly this season. As it is, the Cup offers us a little bit of respite from the situation we are in.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
