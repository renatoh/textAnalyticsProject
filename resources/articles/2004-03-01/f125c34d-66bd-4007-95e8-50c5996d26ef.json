Just when you thought life couldn't get any more difficult for Liverpool, well, erm, it does. With Michael Owen's value dropping hourly, death threats against Gerard Houllier being scrubbed off the training ground wall, Ged himself sat in his office frantically trying to change five years into 10 on his 'Great Liverpool Plan of 1998', and Mr Em covering his ears singing \"la la la\" every time anyone mentions a transfer, news of someone wanting to plough \u00a350m into the club should have been greeted with a small whoop of delight and a sharp click of the heels. But, alas, that offer has come from the prime minister of Thailand, Thaksin Shinawatra. If, like the Fiver, your only involvement with Thai politics is a thorough frisking at Bangkok airport, allow us to explain. Nearly four million people in Thailand use amphetamines... Shinawatra promised to reduce that to zero within three months. The result? More than 2,000 people mysteriously died, bullet-riddled and without being autopsied, according to the Asia Forum human rights group, who nearly choked on their grass juice when Shinawatra claimed the drug-dealers had all shot each other, Once Upon A Time in Mexico style. Put it this way: Shinawatra is a man who regularly has to outrun Amnesty International campaigners (although that's not always too much trouble, running in sandals is never easy). Shinawatra has also been linked with buying up half the controlling Moores family stake in Liverpool, bringing in Chang Beer as the sponsor and pulling his black leather swivel chair up to the board table. Indeed, yesterday the PM and Thai national coach Thavatchai Sajakul confidently declared: \"They want to sell to us, and we want to buy. We want to be part of their club.\" But today, apparently, he just wants \"access\" and help in developing the national squad in Thailand. \"Our intention is not to take over anything,\" said Sajakul. \"Our intention is just to support Thai football.\" Quite how links with Underachievers FC will help, we're not sure, but with talks between the two parties on-going, what price Emile Heskey in Bec-Tero Sasana colours in time for next season? * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"In the week leading up to every game I take dozens and dozens of penalties in front of the gaffer. I thought I couldn't miss. Then the game comes round and you miss your first out of 100. You think 'how's that happened?' I'm not making excuses, or anything, but everything was against me on the day. It was about five minutes before I could take the kick, and there was a swirling wind as well\" - Michael \"50%\" Owen tries to explain away his Portsmouth penalty miss. * * * * * * * * * * * * 3.20 QUEEN MOTHER CHAMPION CHASE Look, you've caught us at a bad time, to be honest. We've just put \u00a350 on the nose of Rooster Booster at 13-8 in the Champion Chase, and they're at the post. So our mind's not really on the news that the FA is going to completely overhaul its disciplinary system by introducing immediate bans and a speeding up of the whole process starting next ... hey, they're off. Come on my beauty, romp home for daddy - Mrs Fiver will be pleased with all that extra cash! Right, where were we? Ah yes, the new disciplinary rules COME ON will target three COME ON MY LOVELY areas. For incidents seen and dealt with by the referee, the COME ON suspension will be immediate. HE'S RIGHT AT THE BACK Appeals will FUME only be allowed SPLUTTER for claims of mistaken identity and will be dealt within REACH FOR BETTING SLIP four working days. IT'S ALL RIGHT, HE'S PICKING UP GROUND Under current rules, suspensions COME ON NICE AND EASY come into effect two weeks NICE after a game. For HE'S IN SECOND! incidents missed by the ref HE'S IN SECOND! but caught on video, cases will be heard within seven days. Suspensions GO ROOSTER! will again be GO immediate GO and appeals GO can be made only against COME ON BABY, JUST ONE MORE FENCE bans of more than NO! HE'S HIT IT HARD three matches. Finally, with PICK UP YOUR LEGS YOU CAN DO THIS events seen by the PICK UP referee but out of his jurisdiction, such as NO! tunnel incidents the FA expects cases to be closed NO within 28 days. FA chief exec NO Mark Palios said: NO NO NO \"This is what football wanted and what football needs.\" WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. SULK. FUME. SHAKE FIST. GAH! * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL The Manchester United panic alarm is screaming at full volume, with Diego Forlan, Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt and Roy Keane all being thrown overboard. Fergie may not be far behind, with Rangers apparently picking new colours on a mauve theme for Alex McLeish's office. And Leeds are hoping Gordon Strachan fancies the First Division rather than family time. * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Rangers defender Fernando Ricksen has been found guilty of violent conduct and given a four-match ban by the SFA after elbowing Hibs' Derek Riordan in the CIS Cup semi-final at Hampden Park on February 5. Manchester City's Chris Shuker is close to becoming new Barnsley manager Paul Hart's first signing. Quinton Fortune's knee injury could put him out of action for a year. And Barcelona's Javier Saviola has asked Thierry Henry to join him at the Nou Camp next season. * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO BBC1: Match Of The Day (11.35pm) Yesterday, we asked for your tales of sporting encounters, featuring the cream of the C-list celebritydom.
