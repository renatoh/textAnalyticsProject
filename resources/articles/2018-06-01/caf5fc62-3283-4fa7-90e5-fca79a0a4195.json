So why did I take a photo?", "bodyText": "\u201cOK, so you are looking at The Persistence of Memory by Salvador Dal\u00ed, arguably his most famous and recognisable work,\u201d says Tony Ellwood, director of the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV). We are only about one-third of the way through a guided tour of the new Winter Masterpieces exhibition, MoMA at NGV, but with promise of \u201cthe Dal\u00ed\u201d the crowd packs in a bit tighter, gets a bit quieter and grows a bit more excited. The painting is immediately recognisable \u2013 it\u2019s the one with all the melting clocks. I\u2019ve seen prints of it on share-house walls, on tea towels, as the cover picture of Facebook events, even replicated in 3D as functioning clocks that drape over shelves at 90-degree angles.

But the surprise of its size doesn\u2019t change the impact of seeing it in person. The colours are vibrant, more so than any reproduction has been able to depict, and despite the image being so very familiar, there\u2019s still something remarkable about seeing it in real life. It feels new, different. This is a recurring theme throughout the exhibition, made up of over 230 works on loan from MoMA. You are brought face to face with familiar scenes and shapes, and repeatedly have your expectations challenged. It is a remarkable achievement for the NGV \u2013 for many of the pieces, this is the first time they\u2019ve left the gallery. And there are an impressive amount of \u201cbig names\u201d on show. Kahlo. Mondrian. Matisse. Van Gogh. Dal\u00ed. These are the A-listers of the art world \u2013 and this is a chance to \u201cmeet\u201d your idols. The works are divided up into eight separate rooms, which progress roughly chronologically and are loosely grouped by theme. It is the first time the NGV has dedicated its entire ground floor to one exhibition. Each room has its \u201crock-star\u201d piece, the one that people flock to first before stepping back and taking in the rest. In one room a man to my right hisses \u201cIt\u2019s a Pollock\u201d in excitement. \u201cGo look!\u201d In another I\u2019m so distracted by Frida Kahlo\u2019s Self-Portrait With Cropped Hair (1940), I completely miss a Picasso. In an era where it is easier than ever to replicate art, where many of the things we are seeing in this gallery are things we\u2019ve seen before, there\u2019s an inherent challenge for these works to live up to their reputations. But at the same time, that is one of the main reasons people will come to see them \u2013 to see how the legend stacks up to reality. For me, seeing Piet Mondrian\u2019s Composition in Red, Blue, and Yellow (1930) was simultaneously thrilling and hollow. It\u2019s a work that inspired Yves Saint Laurent and countless replicas (and Etsy shops) in the decades since. I\u2019ve loved it so much from afar, the real thing never stood a chance. But even so, the opportunity to be just inches away from it is not something I would trade. For every piece that can\u2019t meet an impossible standard however, there\u2019s one that surpasses expectation. It\u2019s brighter, perhaps. Livelier. Or there\u2019s a detail you only take in after seeing it in real life \u2013 in \u201cthe Dal\u00ed\u201d for example, you can get close enough to see that the \u201cmonstrous fleshy figure\u201d, as it is officially described, is a side profile of the artist\u2019s face, complete with eyelashes. In between the \u201crock-stars\u201d, too, there are new favourites-to-be. Amateur photos of these artworks on display are going to fill our newsfeeds. There will be so many selfies with the Van Gogh that greets you at the entrance, with the Warhol Marilyn Monroe series, with Roy Lichtenstein\u2019s iconic Drowning Girl (1963) that you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve seen the exhibition 10 times. One man tsk-ed as everyone struggled to capture their own image of \u201cthe Dal\u00ed\u201d, shaking his head and saying under his breath \u201clook with your eyes not through a screen\u201d. But this is part of the experience too \u2013 at least in moderation. My phone is filled with photos that no one but me will want to see. It\u2019s because these images are so easy to access, to copy, to buy a cheap print of to slap on your wall, that we want proof \u2013 these pictures say I was there, that I saw these works in person. The exhibition is so large that to get to the second half we need to pass through the gift shop. On the wall there is a print of \u201cthe Dal\u00ed\u201d for sale. It\u2019s bigger than the original \u2013 and just a little bit duller. \u2022 MoMA at NGV: 130 Years of Modern and Contemporary Art is showing at the National Gallery of Victoria until 7 October"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
