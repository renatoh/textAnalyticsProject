This is a new live blog covering developments in Libya. 11.36pm: In a long and rambling address to the Libyan people live on state television, Muammar Gaddafi's son, Saif, has been warning that the uprising against the regime is doomed to fail. \"This is an opposition movement, a separatist movement that threatens the unity of Libya as a country,\" according to the BBC translation of what Saif al-Islam Gaddafi said. He claimed that the number of \"casualties\" has not exceeded 84 but has accused the foreign media of exaggerating the death toll in the city of Benghazi. There was a mistake on the Army's side when it came to confronting the protests, he said, adding that some of those who attacked the soldiers were \"under the influence of drugs\". He claimed that at least three different groups are involved in the protests, one of which he described as \"islamic\". It's unclear at this stage who he is referring to, be he claimed that the government have made a series of arrests and have detained outsiders who he said were brought into the country to foment unrest. He claimed that there was a plan by those seeking to overthrow the government to create a series of small emirates in Libya. 11.42pm: Gaddafi's son issued a series of warnings that appeared designed to spread fear among the general population and deter them from joining the uprising. The warnings ranged from predicting that the price of bread would rocket to warning that foreign oil companies would pull out of Libya. He predicted that the country would be plunged into civil war if those who had taken up arms against the state did not pull back. 11.45pm: He also referred to the telephone conversation he had with William Hague earlier in the day and insinuated that the call from London was a sinister sign of things to come. \"The British foreign minister has given me a phone call,\" he said, according to early translations of the statement. \"Be ready because that means that foreign occupation is coming back to Libya\" Going on, he appeared intent on depicting the uprising as an attempt to establish Islamic emirates in Libya and warned viewers that this would bring down the wrath of the US and Europe \"The west and America will not allow any Islamic emirates to be formed in the middle east. They will not allow chaos in Libya. They will not allow chaos that would result in chaos and terrorism.\" 11.48pm: Saif, who has in the past pushed a reform agenda in Libya with only limited success, also appeared to hold out a carrot. He said the General People's Congress, Libya's equivalent of a parliament, would convene on Monday to discuss a \"clear\" reform agenda, while the government would also raise wages. 11.49pm: While Saif Gaddafi has been speaking, reports have been streaming in of how the unrest appears to be spreading to Tripoli from other cities. This is from Reuters: Libya's unrest spread to the capital Tripoli on Sunday after scores of protesters were killed in the second city Benghazi, which appeared to have slipped out of control of forces loyal to strongman Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi has attempted to put down protests with a violent crackdown, triggering some of the worst bloodshed in the two months since unrest began sweeping across the Arab world. In the first sign of serious unrest in the capital, thousands of protesters clashed with supporters of Gadaffi in Tripoli. Gunfire could be heard and police using tear gas to disperse the demonstrators. In Benghazi, centre of Libya's unrest, tens of thousands of people took to the streets and appeared to be in control of the city before security forces opened fire and killed scores. Benghazi residents said soldiers from a unit had joined their protest and defeated a force Gaddafi's elite guards. Bodies were brought to a hospital riddled with bullets and wounds from rocket-propelled grenades. A witness in Tripoli said police in the capital were using tear gas against protesters, some of whom were throwing stones at billboards of Gaddafi. A resident of the capital told Reuters by telephone he could hear gunshots in the streets. \"We're inside the house and the lights are out. There are gunshots in the street,\" he said. \"That's what I hear, gunshots and people. I can't go outside.\" An expatriate worker said protesters were being dispersed by police and he could see burning cars in the capital. 11.55pm: Back to some more segments from Saif's address, which is being met with widespread derision by opponents of the Libyan regime on twitter and elsewhere. Muammar Gaddafi's son said that his father remained in the country and was backed by the army. \"We will fight to the last minute, until the last bullet,\" he added. Earlier, he admitted protesters have seized control of some military bases, weapons and tanks. \"We are not Tunisia and Egypt,\" he went on to insist, referring to the successful uprisings that toppled longtime regimes in Libya's neighbors. 11.59pm: It appears from the role played tonight by Saif al-Gaddafi that the Libyan dictator's son is destined to play a key role in whatever events shape Libyan history in the days ahead. An Anglophile who studied a the London School of Economics, his strong connections to Britain will no doubt be of great interest to many. 12.10am: You can read a profile of Saif, written by the Guardian's Middle East Editor, Ian Black, here. 12.16am: The fall-out from events in Libya appears to be taking a toll among representatives of the regime abroad. Al Jazeera has reported that the Libyan ambassador to China resigned earlier this evening during an interview live on air. Now, BBC Arabic is reporting that the Libyan ambassador to India has also resigned from his post in protest at the violence being used to suppress the protests at home. 12.23am: Middle eastern commentator Sultan Sooud Al Qassemi, who tweets at @SultanAlQassemi, has been quick on the draw with a translation of Saif's statement tonight. You can read it here. 12.30am: Users of twitter is beginning to pick up on Saif's connections with Britain, including his recent \u00a31.5m donation to the London School of Economic's Centre for Global Governance. Nuggets like this from Saif's own LSE PhD are also being poured over: \"I shall be primarily concerned with the central failing of global governance: it is highly undemocratic.\" 12.36am: On Saif's LSE donation, @randomvariable tweets Gaddafi's donation was accepted by David Held, writer of the key undergrad textbook \"Models of Democracy\" In the meantime, you can pass on comments for tonight's blog by contacting me at @BenQuinn75 12.44am: Here's some fairly typical reaction to the Saif's speech on twitter. @EnoughGaddafi tweets: Many people believed #saifalislam was a reformer, today's speech was a sign of more of the same, gaddafi theater #libya #feb17 12.52am: The local time in Tripoli is now just before 3am but the impact of events there and in other parts of Libya has been filtering through to international markets. This was filed earlier from Singapore by Reuters journalists: April Brent crude and U.S. crude futures rose more than $1 a barrel on Monday as the threat of supply disruptions from OPEC member Libya grew, with protesters calling for the departure of the country's veteran ruler, Muammar Gaddafi. The leader of the Al-Zuwayya tribe in eastern Libya threatened on Sunday to cut oil exports to Western countries within 24 hours unless authorities stopped the \"oppression of protesters\". 12.58am: @naomimc has just pointed out that Saif Gaddafi is apparently a keen user of twitter himself. It seems that he currently boasts 158 followers at @SaifGaddafi. Wonder if that number is going to go up or down? 1.25am: In comparison to the protests in Tunisia and Egypt, the nature of Libya's regime has meant that it has been much more difficult for the international media to get a handle on events there. However, those inside the country have continued to stay in touch by telephone with the Guardian and other news outlets. Al Jazeera has been carrying an audio recording of an interview tonight with a pro-democracy activist in Tripoli. He identified the city's Green Square as Libya's potential equivalent to Tahrir Square in Cairo and Pearl roundabout in Manama, Bahrain. The man told the channel that he and others had marched to the square earlier and managed to displace Gaddafi loyalists who had been attempting to prevent opponents of the regime from entering it. He claimed that marchers had come under fire from snipers and from civilians throwing rocks, but had succeeded in taking over the square. 1.31am: We're going to wrap it up for now on the liveblog, but join us again in a few hours for further coverage of this fast-developing situation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
