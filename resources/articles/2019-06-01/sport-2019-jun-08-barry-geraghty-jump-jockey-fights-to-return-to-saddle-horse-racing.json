It is a testament to how wrong such rumours can be that the veteran jump jockey is now battling to get back from what he describes as the worst bone break he has ever suffered and yet he still cannot contemplate the idea of quitting the saddle. \u201cI enjoy it so much, I really do,\u201d he says, an external frame still holding together the bits of his lower right leg, shattered by an Aintree fall in April. \u201cFor me, there\u2019s nothing better than turning in with two to jump and \u2018race on\u2019. I\u2019d miss that too much.\u201d Geraghty\u2019s weighing room colleagues have been setting a clear example for him this spring, Noel Fehily having retired in March and Ruby Walsh in May. Walsh is four months older than Geraghty, so possibly there is an element of denial when the younger man says how surprised he was at the other\u2019s decision to call a halt, right after winning the Punchestown Gold Cup. \u201cLike, there was a little bit of chat,\u201d Geraghty says. \u201cBut I was at home, watching it that day, and I was shocked. Having ridden so brilliantly, all the way through his career, but on that day in particular, he gave Kemboy an unbelievable ride, and then just to sign off \u2026 It was alien to me, to see him do that. I couldn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t get my head round it. But he obviously had his head round it. \u201cI was there at Punchestown on the Thursday and the Friday after it and he was still going round with a smile and happy. You can\u2019t fake that. He had made the right decision, he signed off on the top note.\u201d For jockeys of their standing, there will never be a perfect time to retire because there will always be a promising young horse that might give them several big days the next winter. Even so, Geraghty is still stunned that Walsh would quit just as the enormous talent of Chacun Pour Soi (\u201cthat good horse of Ricci\u2019s that beat Defi Du Seuil\u201d) was beginning to reveal itself. \u201cThat was a head-scratcher to me,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd AP [McCoy] was a bit the same, we were both saying, \u2018Jeez ...\u2019 But that\u2019s Ruby, it\u2019s black and white and he called it.\u201d Geraghty is not ready to call it. Now that Walsh has gone, he has more Cheltenham Festival wins to his name than any jockey who still holds a licence and hopes to add to his tally of 38 next year. The skill, insight and sheer effort that went into getting Sire Du Berlais to win the Pertemps Final in March amounted to one of the finest rides seen at the home of jump racing or anywhere else. Thanks to his job riding for JP McManus, there is a stack of equine talent to keep in mind if he needs motivating during the long, tedious hours of rehab that lie ahead. Before that, there is the small matter of getting his bones to heal. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s the worst fracture I\u2019ve had. I broke the other leg, I\u2019ve broken both arms but yeah ... it was a straightforward break, a clean break, but it had to be realigned, there was a bit of work had to go into it.\u201d With his 40th birthday on the horizon, it is no surprise that Geraghty\u2019s body takes a bit longer to repair itself than it might have done a couple of decades ago. \u201cI would have denied that for years. But our now four-year-old son broke his leg off the trampoline two years ago and he took the exact same fracture as I\u2019d done the year before that. He was running round in the cast 12 days later. I wasn\u2019t running round in the cast 12 weeks later. As much as you want to deny it, the body slows down, I suppose. \u201cI saw the surgeon last week and he\u2019s very happy with it. I\u2019ll see him again in a couple of weeks. It\u2019s progressing well. I was originally hoping to make it back for Galway and that\u2019s still a possibility,\u201d he says, alluding to the week-long meeting that starts on 29 July. \u201cI haven\u2019t pressed him for an answer about timing. You can only really know two weeks before.\u201d In the meantime, he keeps himself busy by attending to the three children and 10 horses that share a home with him. For most of his career, Geraghty has made an enjoyable sideline out of buying and selling young horses, the Gold Cup winner Bobs Worth being the most notable example, and at least he has time to put into that this summer. \u201cThat\u2019s always something I\u2019ve been into, it\u2019s a good distraction. And I\u2019ve some nice ones to look forward to.\u201d With his fellow injured jockey Mark Enright, who has a fractured shoulder, Geraghty recently loaded some ponies into a trailer and took them to his child\u2019s play school, where they gave a group of youngsters their first chance to sit in a saddle. Weren\u2019t the poor kids scared by the sight of two battered old jump jockeys? He laughs and acknowledges that the pair of them may not, at that point, have been looking their best. \u201cThat was one of my initial worries about getting the frame, this\u2019ll be desperate for our own kids to have to look at this. But kids adjust and within two days it\u2019s become second nature.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
