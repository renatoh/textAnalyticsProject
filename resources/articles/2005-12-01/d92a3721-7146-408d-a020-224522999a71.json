Staff on the Glasgow daily were told today that Douglas-Home had left, although publisher Newsquest gave no reason for his departure. In an email to staff, the paper's managing director, Timothy Blott, said the vacancy would be advertised. \"I wish to thank Mark for the hard work and endeavour he has put into developing the title over the past five years. He has been responsible for launching a portfolio of new products and maintaining high editorial standards. The company wishes him well for the future,\" Mr Blott said. The Herald's deputy editor, Joan McAlpine, will step in until a permanent replacement is found. Douglas-Home joined the paper in 2000, having previously been editor of the Sunday Times Scotland. He is a former deputy editor of Scotland on Sunday and news editor of the Scotsman, and was the Scotland correspondent for the Independent from 1986 to 1990. The Herald was bought by US newspaper publisher Gannett in 2003. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
