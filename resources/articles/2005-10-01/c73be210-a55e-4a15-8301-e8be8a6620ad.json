That vote was, quite literally, without precedent in British war-making. For many centuries, right up to the time of Tony Blair, parliament has often been an active backdrop to the march to war. Yet until 2003 parliament never controlled the use of force. Until Iraq, MPs never formally voted on a substantive motion before force was authorised - not even in the 20th century's two world wars. Now, if MPs back Clare Short's private member's bill in the Commons tomorrow, that will change and the democratic precedent established on Iraq will be given statutory force. It is one of the unacceptable anachronisms of the British constitution that the deployment of troops and the issuing of orders to engage in hostilities are matters of the royal prerogative, exercisable nowadays by ministers alone. No decision is more important than a decision to go to war, yet in 21st century Britain government ministers - and, in effect nowadays, that means the prime minister and his immediate advisers - possess a theoretical and legal freedom of action to make war that Charles I might have envied. In practice, as Mr Blair acknowledged in January 2003, it is difficult to think of \"a set of circumstances in which a government can go to war without the support of parliament\". But, as Mr Blair continued: \"There is a right to vote. The question is, do you take that one step further and get rid of the royal prerogative?\" For anyone who believes in modern and effective parliamentary government, the answer to that question must surely be yes. Ms Short's bill would give the Commons the war powers that the US Senate commands - but with teeth to prevent the executive from dodging the issue in the way that, since world war two, has been routine for all US presidents. The bill has wide all-party support. Its original backers ranged from the late Robin Cook to Kenneth Clarke and William Hague. But it will only get past its first Commons hurdle tomorrow if enough backbench MPs of all parties make the effort to turn out and vote for it. These days, MPs have grown accustomed to not staying at Westminster on Fridays (a regrettable consequence of Mr Cook's reforms). This week, at least 100 must break that habit and stay in London to support Ms Short. MPs often understandably lament the declining authority of parliament. Here is an opportunity for them to do something about it themselves."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
