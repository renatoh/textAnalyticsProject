A study by Barclays Capital found the only risk to the UK of not joining monetary union would be a loss of inward investment, but that the lack of compatibility would result in premature entry hitting growth and jobs. With speculation still swirling round the financial markets about the possible timing of a referendum in Britain, the pound yesterday fell to another 15-year-low of just over $1.37 against a strong dollar. The euro slipped to its lowest for six months against the US currency, dropping to $0.8413 amid reports that it could soon test the $0.80 level. The Barclays Capital study said Britain's economy remained strikingly different from the rest of the eurozone. It argued that economic growth was poorly correlated with that of the euro area core (Germany), and that Britain reacted to economic shocks in a different way. \"This is not the basis for a successful monetary union as it implies a need for independent monetary policy\", said the report by the bank's UK economists, David Hillier and Adam Law. The report was seized upon by the campaign against UK entry orchestrated by Business for Sterling and New Europe. A spokesman said the report showed the government will not be able to claim a \"clear and unambiguous case\" for replacing the pound. Other reports by City firms recently have suggested that a narrowing in the interest-rate and inflation gaps between Britain and the eurozone have brought the UK to a point where the government could argue that economic convergence had been achieved. \"The broad conclusion is that while many differences still exist between the UK and euro-area economies, these are smaller than they were in 1997 and in many cases no larger than those existing between existing euro-area economies,\" said Danny Gabay of JP Morgan. Mr Hillier said last night: \"The UK economy does not work in the same way as the euro-zone economies. \"For instance, our housing market is different from that in France as we manage debt along flexible rates. And the composition of our exports are different, we are far more reliant on oil and less on manufacturing than Germany and have more trade with the USA and Asia.\" Mr Hillier added, however, the key difference was in the labour market where \"20 years of Tory rule\" had stripped out legislation and the impact of the trade unions, making the economy more flexible. He said: \"Put all of this together, and it should not be too much of a surprise to find that our economy responds differently to changes in interest rates from the five largest EMU countries.\" Mr Brown has said the Treasury will assess the five tests for entry in the next two years. Officials will decide whether business cycles and economic structures are compatible, whether there is sufficient flexibility to deal with problems, the impact on long-term investment and the City, and whether joining the euro would promote higher growth, stability and a lasting increase in jobs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
