So it was intriguing, on the eve of Tuesday\u2019s second leg of the tautly wound World Cup play\u2011off between the Republic of Ireland and Denmark, to hear O\u2019Neill tease his captain, David Meyler, about missing penalties in training. There is a real possibility of the match here ending in the same 0-0 scoreline as the first leg on Saturday and, therefore, of a penalty shootout being required. That would determine who advances to the World Cup finals, and who is left to survey the rubble of a 14-month qualification campaign. When asked about that scenario, Meyler declared his confidence he would score from the spot if called. Not many managers would have chosen that moment to bring their player\u2019s training-ground failures to public attention but O\u2019Neill did so with a deadpan interjection. Everyone in the room laughed, except Meyler, who, after being taken by surprise, looked playfully exasperated. O\u2019Neill had succeeded in introducing levity into what could have been a heavy preview \u2013 but in a pointed way. He defused the tension around the occasion while reminding his player talk is cheap. Deeds are sport\u2019s true currency. For Ireland, this play-off is a balancing act. They must find the right blend between defence and attack, fervour and composure. In Copenhagen they defended with steel but offered little going forward. O\u2019Neill knows that must change, at least a little, if they are to score the one goal or more they will need to progress without a shootout. He knows his players must remain focused enough to deny space to inventive Danes such as Christian Eriksen and Thomas Delaney. They must also pass more incisively than they did on Saturday, when they concentrated so hard on keeping the ball away from their own goal they neglected to figure out how to get it near Denmark\u2019s. \u201cWe will try to be that bit more expansive if we can and deal with the ball a wee bit better,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. Wes Hoolahan often delivers the ideal mixture but usually begins on the bench, where he stayed in the first leg. O\u2019Neill did not say whether the Norwich City schemer would start on Tuesday. The suspicion is the only changes will see Meyler return to central midfield so Robbie Brady can shift wide and replace Callum O\u2019Dowda, while Shane Long may start up front. The Southampton striker has not scored for club or country since February but Denmark\u2019s defenders may be more bothered by his mobility than by Daryl Murphy\u2019s brawn. O\u2019Neill hailed his team\u2019s fighting qualities but said: \u201cIt should not be everything in our side because eventually, as well as spirit, you have to be able to play.\u201d Meyler reckoned Ireland\u2019s spirit will give them the edge: \u201cDenmark don\u2019t have the character, heart and desire we have.\u201d The opposing manager, Age Hareide, retorted: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know us.\u201d O\u2019Neill referred to his team\u2019s record of rising somehow to grand occasions. \u201cWe are going to try to win the game and will try to find a way to win it,\u201d he said. \u201cThese players have been able to do that in the last couple of years.\u201d Teams of similar or higher standing to Denmark can vouch for that, including Germany, Italy, Bosnia\u2011Herzegovina, Austria and Wales \u2013 all beaten by Ireland in high-stakes showdowns. In this campaign, Ireland\u2019s best performances came away from home. They scored only four goals in their five group games in Dublin. Hareide highlighted this fact and referred to the possession and pass completion statistics from the first leg, which were heavily in Denmark\u2019s favour. He is not buying O\u2019Neill\u2019s attacking talk. \u201cIreland will play the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just want us to make mistakes. That\u2019s OK. I haven\u2019t got the patience to play like that. We\u2019ll try to attack.\u201d He is so convinced Denmark will break through this time they have not practised penalties. \u201cWe won\u2019t need them,\u201d he said. Ireland (4-2-3-1, probable): Randolph; Christie, Clark, Duffy, Ward; Arter, Meyler; Brady, Hendrick, McClean; Long. Denmark (4-3-3, probable): Schmeichel; Ankersen, Kjaear, Bjelland, Larsen; Eriksen, Kvist, Delaney; Poulsen, Cornelius, Sisto.
