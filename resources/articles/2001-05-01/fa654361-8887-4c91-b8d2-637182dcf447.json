The 0.25% reduction to 5.25% followed calls to reduce the official cost of borrowing, amid signs that the global economic turmoil is beginning to hit Britain. Tuesday's election announcement meant that today's rate cut was the most politically sensitive decision that the bank has had to face since it assumed responsibility for setting rates four years ago. The cut will lead to cheaper mortgage rates for millions of home owners and provide a huge boost for the Labour party at the start of the campaign. The Bank of England's governor, Sir Edward George, has repeatedly insisted that the monetary policy committee will not be deterred from moving rates during an election campaign if they consider a change is necessary. The Halifax said it would be matching today's interest rate cut, reducing its variable mortgage rate by 0.25% to 6.25% with immediate effect for new borrowers, and on June 1 for existing borrowers. The group said that its mortgage rates would remain at their lowest levels since 1965 following the cut. HSBC also passed on the cut, slashing its variable rate to 6.00% from June 4. The rate cut was applauded by Digby Jones, director general of the Confederation of British Industry. He said: \"Companies will be relieved the Bank has seized the opportunity to soften the impact of the global slowdown. \"This was a timely and proportionate move that will steady business nerves without taking risks with inflation. We need to keep rates moving in a downward direction as quickly as prudently possible.\" The cut had been widely predicted in the City, where some felt the monetary policy committee may even opt for a 0.5% reduction. David Page, economist at City stockbroker Investec, said that there was a clear case for a rate cut. \"We have seen more deterioration in the economy over the last weeks, with the slowdown in Europe having an effect on manufacturing.\" He added: \"There is every possibility of a further 0.25% cut before interest rates head up again.\" David Sears, deputy director general at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the Bank had \"won the business vote\" with its decision to lower rates. He said: \"With business already planning to reduce output, this will bring a boost to confidence and add further insulation against the US slowdown and the wider impact of foot and mouth.\" Mr Sears warned the Bank, however, that it should not hesitate to cut rates again next month, even though the decision would have to be taken a day before the general election. Stephen Radley, chief economist at the Engineers Employers' Federation, said the decision to cut rates would give manufacturers \"some relief\" as conditions started to get tougher. He said: \"With margins set to be squeezed further by a slowing world economy, a cut in the cost of borrowing will give business a breathing space.\" Earlier today, figures released by the Office for National Statistics showed manufacturing output fell 0.3% in March, adding to the evidence that the global economic slowdown is hurting UK businesses. Industrial production also fell during the month, decreasing by 0.2%. Meanwhile, the prime minister, Tony Blair said that the economy will be \"the defining issue\" of the general election. Any party wanting to govern had to have a credible plan for interest rates, borrowing, investment and to avoid the temptation of promising unaffordable tax cuts, he added.
