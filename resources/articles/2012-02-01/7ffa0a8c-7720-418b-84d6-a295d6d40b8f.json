He's been in the dark for eight years, imprisoned by al-Qaida. He's been tortured, he's been made to beat a fellow US marine to death. No one knows he's still alive \u2013 until a special operations unit stumbles upon him during a raid. What does he do first? He calls his wife, of course \u2013 just as she's getting her breath back from making sexy time with her new boyfriend, Brody's old best mate from back in the day. Then, when he's flown home, he has to deal with the spotlight \u2013 the media, yellow ribbons, visits from the vice-president, all of that, because he's now, officially, an American Hero. That must be hard after eight years in a hole in the desert. Plus he has to meet with the wife of his buddy, the one he beat to death. There are nightmares and flashbacks. And as if that wasn't enough, there's this renegade CIA officer, Carrie Mathison, who's convinced that Brody was turned by al-Qaida, that he now represents the single biggest threat to US security. Maybe she's right and he does ... This is Homeland (Channel 4, Sunday), and it's brilliant. A proper knuckle-gnawing thriller that grabs you by the goolies (or lady-goolies) and drags you along for the ride whether you like it or not. In the same way that 24 did in many ways. But unlike 24, which veered off into madness, there's a plausibility about Homeland. Nor is it so simplistically broken down into good v evil, them'n'us; the lines are hazier, it's more complex, a study of suspicion and paranoia as well as bombs and bullets, more like the real post-9/11 world. There are fine performances wherever you look, not least from our own Damian Lewis who plays Brody and who joins an ever-growing list of us playing them in their own backyards, a list that already includes Laurie, McShane, Izzard, Driver, Elba, West, Fiennes (J), Lincoln, and probably more I can't think of. I don't know, they come over here, they take our actors ... except that it makes you swell with national pride. Perhaps. But the show stealer is Claire Danes, who plays Mathison, the driven CIA agent who has internal demons to deal with on top of the threat from Islamist terrorism. It's a mesmerising portrayal of a woman teetering along the thin line between genius and psychosis. Oh, and Morgan Saylor as the Brodys' stroppy teenage daughter is excellent too; she says and does what real stroppy teenagers say and do. Unlike, say, the infuriating children in Terra Nova. Oh, and that's something else that's good about Homeland \u2013 this is a big US drama series without any bloody dinosaurs. Or aliens, or \"others\", or time warps. Aren't we a bit over all that? This is about the real world, and that makes you care about it. I know it's early days, I've seen only one, but it could be one of the TV highlights of the year. I'm hooked, can you tell? Get involved if you aren't already. It's hard not to feel a little bit sorry for the reincarnation of Upstairs Downstairs (BBC1, Sunday), because of its total eclipse by the international television phenomenon that is Downton Abbey. Upstairs Downstairs is beautifully made, elegantly scripted, well-performed, meticulous in period detail and captures a time (we've now reached 1938 and the run-in to the second world war, so not a bad time to be capturing). It's just a bit, well, dowdy in comparison (and because of the subject matter \u2013 class soap opera played out in a big posh house with history plus social change going on in background \u2013 comparison is inevitable). Even when Downton went officially mad last season it was fun-mad, and glam-mad. Whereas there's a frumpiness about Upstairs Downstairs, it lives in the shadow of its more glamorous younger sister, like Lady Edith lives in the shadow of Lady Sybil. See? It's even overlooked in the hunt for metaphors. Poor Upstairs Downstairs. And I did quite enjoy the gassing of the monkey. Which leaves very little room for Luck (Sky Atlantic, Saturday), which is probably a good thing, as I think I need another episode to fully understand what's going on. Next week then. It looks fabulous though, sort of Boardwalk Empire with horses (lovely shiny horses, the action scenes are amazing). And some very big names. Is TV the new film?
