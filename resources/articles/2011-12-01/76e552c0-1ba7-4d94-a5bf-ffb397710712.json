Arsenal's record goalscorer, who is training with his former club during the MLS close season, has been the subject of repeated inquiries from the media throughout his reappearance at the club's headquarters at London Colney. On Friday, Wenger seemed to have softened in his stance towards re-signing Henry, having shifted his response from outright dismissive to evasively ambivalent. \"It has to come through my brain at some stage but I haven't been concrete on the case,\" said Wenger. He was much more emphatic about the issue of whether or not Henry would still be able to cut it in the Premier League at the age of 34: \"Yes\". The matter of bringing in another striker, even temporarily, is urgent, as in January Arsenal will lose two of their attackers, Gervinho and Marouane Chamakh, for potentially seven weeks as they head off for the Africa Cup of Nations. Even if he stays clear of injury, Robin van Persie will need a rest at some stage over the winter schedule. The only other options are Park Chu-young, who has not played a minute of Premier League football; pushing Andrey Arshavin, who has scored one league goal this season, into an emergency striker role; or moving Theo Walcott inside from the wide position that has been productive so far this term. There is a certain logic in registering Henry in that there would obviously be no adaptation period to worry about. Wenger admitted that he is yet to bring up the idea of a loan with either Henry or the New York Red Bulls. \"I haven't even investigated that,\" he said. But he is open to investigation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
