In the early 1960s Diane Ladd and her then husband, Bruce Dern, suffered an excruciating loss when their 18-month-old daughter drowned. The trauma was not just emotional but physical, and doctors told her that she would be unable have another child. But they were wrong, and the proof was Dern. One confounded doctor travelled to the hospital to witness \u201cthe miracle child\u201d. From her home in Ojai, California, Ladd\u2019s smoky southern voice over the phone ripples gently with emotion as she talks to me about her daughter. The miracle child, now 52, grew up to be a great actor in her own right, sometimes even appearing alongside her mother. In 1991, Princess Diana was so taken by the idea that a real-life mother and daughter could play alternative versions of themselves on screen that she flew them both to London for a royal premiere of their garlanded film, Rambling Rose. Ladd recalls \u201cpouring sweat\u201d as she sat next to the princess. Dern was struck by the ways in which her host connected to her character. \u201cShe was empathy in cellular form.\u201d Dern and I are sitting in the Whitby Hotel, in midtown New York. Dapper waiters float around with three-tiered cake plates. She is wearing a red T-shirt imprinted with the words \u201cMamam je t\u2019aime,\u201d a Mother\u2019s Day gift from her children. \u201cMy kids know I want to move to Paris,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve still not done face work [cosmetic surgery] at 70, there will be directors there who will hire me and we\u2019ll get to explore while allowing me to be my age.\u201d A menu arrives, and Dern, who has been up since 5am nods enthusiastically at the suggestion of a strawberry tart. \u201cA little sugar sounds amazing,\u201d she says. The hotel is designed in the style of an English country home and Dern would like to know when we might get to talk about her love of London. \u201cWhen I\u2019m there I get to have Monmouth Coffee, the park, and the actor Andrew Garfield,\u201d she says as if these three items were on everyone\u2019s British bucket list. \u201cWhat more do you need?\u201d Why Garfield? \u201cHe\u2019s a great, deep soul.\u201d If Dern\u2019s exuberance is a mask, she wears it very well. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018me\u2019 to be a mystery,\u201d she says, and then revises the thought. \u201cWell, maybe I\u2019m a mystery to a few boys in my life, but that\u2019s good, that\u2019s OK.\u201d A night earlier, she had attended a screening of Trial by Fire, based on the real-life story of Cameron Todd Willingham, executed in Texas in 2004 for a crime he very likely did not commit. It is not a spoiler to say that the movie ends with an unflinching scene of death by lethal injection. A woman in the audience had turned to a friend and joked about needing a Valium to get through it. Long before they met in person, Dern (who plays activist Elizabeth Gilbert), had taken to writing long, intimate letters to Jack O\u2019Connell (who plays Willingham) as a way to draw closer to Gilbert\u2019s experience. \u201cI reached out and said, \u2018May we correspond by letter?\u2019 and we did that very intimately, very deeply \u2013 we shared personal history and secrets.\u201d For Dern, Gilbert\u2019s letters were \u201cempathy in action\u201d. \u201cAnyone can make a small gesture of kindness to another person that can effect change in the world, it\u2019s that simple,\u201d she says. Empathy is a favourite word of Dern\u2019s \u2013 shorthand for the kind of communion she works to find with her characters, however compromised they may seem. In conversation, she seems to be looking for points of convergence and connection, in place of the usual wariness between the journalist and subject. Trump\u2019s demonisation of Hollywood and the media have brought us together, she says. \u201cHow do we get the word out about what truth looks like, or what people are doing, or injustice, or what it is to be human and complicated?\u201d The letters with O\u2019Connell were also a kind of key Dern used to unlock her character. There is always a key. To prepare for Renata Klein, the clench-jawed control freak she plays on the runaway hit TV series, Big Little Lies, Dern interviewed female leaders in tech to help figure out her character\u2019s motivation. In 2018, she won a Golden Globe for her efforts, one of four the series took home that year. \u201cRenata is fierce and complicated and a nightmare, and also just wants a girlfriend and deserves to be seen because she\u2019s lived in a man\u2019s world her whole life,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd what it takes for a woman in tech, a woman in banking, a woman in publishing \u2013 who you have to be and what you have to walk through to get the one seat in that boardroom of 13\u2026\u201d As on the show, the misogyny isn\u2019t exclusive to men. One CEO of a major Silicon Valley startup confided in Dern how crushed she felt after a mother sent her a photo of her son playing soccer with a note that read, \u201cHere\u2019s a picture of your kid, I know you\u2019re too busy to come to the games usually.\u201d Dern throws her hands up in a gesture of exasperation. \u201cShe said, \u2018I am a mom trying to show up and the people that shame me about being a working mother are the other moms.\u2019\u201d Dern would hear the same story in different variations over and again. Big Little Lies is about what men do to women, but it\u2019s also about what women do to each other, and to themselves. Season one of Big Little Lies was framed by a mystery: someone was a victim and someone was a culprit. The who was the thread that kept audiences guessing until the finale. What can we expect for an encore? \u201cThey\u2019re allowed to feel everything now, while also being watched,\u201d says Dern. \u201cWhat\u2019s cool is that we are no longer servicing a whodunit plot, so the plot can be entrenched in the volcano of emotion we\u2019re all feeling.\u201d On set, Dern and her co-stars have all forged a camaraderie that is novel after decades of feeling marginalised or excluded by a system that favoured men. Dern sits on the 54-member board of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which voted to strip Harvey Weinstein of his membership in 2017. Like so many, and not just in Hollywood, she has found herself re-evaluating behaviour and structures she once took for granted. \u201cHere we were \u2013 particularly Reese [Witherspoon], Nicole [Kidman], and myself, working alongside each other since we were basically kids \u2013 but they isolated us,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were never with another [female] actor on set, the crew was all male, so we never said, \u2018Hey, have you ever gone to a hotel to have an audition and nobody else is there, and you feel so terrified and uncomfortable?\u2019\u201d Of her years of auditions, Dern estimates that 75% were in hotel rooms. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s a little couch and then a bed, and so you\u2019d be asked to sit next to the director on the bed and read the scene that\u2019s kind of a romantic scene, and you\u2019re still a child?\u201d Dern was six when she decided she wanted to be an actor. It was 1973 and she had spent the school holiday shuttling back and forth between film sets. \u201cMy dad [Bruce Dern] was shooting Family Plot with Hitchcock, and my mom was shooting Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Anymore with Scorsese and, believe it or not, at the end of that summer I was, like, \u2018I think I want to be an actress.\u2019\u201d For Ladd, who launched her career as a chorus girl at New York\u2019s Copacabana, the prospect of her daughter joining the family trade was a dismal one. \u201cI did not want my daughter to be an actress, but she outsmarted me,\u201d she recalls. \u201cShe said, \u2018Oh mother, if I could play the piano, would you tie my hands behind my back and tell me I had to wait until I was 21 to play?\u2019\u201d At the age of 17, Dern sued for emancipation, a kind of legal divorce that allows children to make decisions without parental approval. She says it was not personal, but professional. Ladd allowed her to leave home on the condition she live with Marianne Williamson, a writer of self-help books now vying for the Democratic nomination for president. Although she always knew what kind of career she wanted, the template was changing by the time Dern was breaking out. \u201cI was exposed to a real equality in the kind of characters that men and women played in storytelling,\u201d Dern remembers. \u201cBut once I started auditioning, 10 years later, the roles weren\u2019t the same. Something shifted and we were back to the Madonna-or-whore in a movie.\u201d She remembers a prescient encounter at school, when she was 14, shortly after wrapping Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains, about a girl punk band. \u201cA boy was sitting with me and my best friend, and he was a year older than us, and he said, \u2018I know the kind of girl you are.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018The kind of girl I am?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yeah, you know, there\u2019s two kinds of girls: the kind you sleep with and the kind you want to marry.\u2019\u201d Dern, he said, was the kind of girl a guy married; her friend was the kind a guy just slept with. \u201cWe were both equally crushed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was like someone branded us.\u201d Dern internalised the boy\u2019s comment. \u201cI was left feeling like if I didn\u2019t lead with sexuality I wasn\u2019t enough, that if I didn\u2019t prove to a boy that I could be all things, I\u2019d failed,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd yet I won the prize because I got picked for a long time; my friend felt hot, but a throwaway.\u201d It was David Lynch, says Dern, who showed her that she could be all things equally. He cast her first in Blue Velvet and then some years later in Wild at Heart, his twisted road movie about two lovers on the run. \u201cWild at Heart is so interesting because I\u2019m all of it,\u201d says Dern. \u201cI\u2019m the girl he picks, and she\u2019s sexual and wild, and it\u2019s all about mess and insanity, but it\u2019s a gift when you can be all of it.\u201d Lately, Dern has found herself playing a multitude of mothers. It has come at just the moment when she finds her own children \u2013 Ellery, her 17-year-old son, and Jaya, her 14-year-old daughter, both from her former marriage to the musician Ben Harper (the couple divorced in 2012) \u2013 taking tentative steps towards their adult lives. Last September Ellery walked the runway for Calvin Klein. \u201cSuddenly my son is 17, and I\u2019m realising he may not always live in my house with me, and that has been rather devastating.\u201d The actor smiles glumly. \u201cAs a parent, I felt and thought that, forever, my life would look and feel just like this.\u201d Meanwhile, Dern\u2019s maternal instinct continues to blossom into a series of powerful onscreen matriarchs. \u201cI love playing characters who lead with their desperation and their rage, and their ferocity and their loneliness and their vulnerability, because these were all things that when I started acting weren\u2019t necessarily on the page.\u201d She used to think she was fearless, but turning 50 shifted her perspective. Sometimes she thinks that she is only just catching up with her daughter in the way she is learning to think about herself. \u201cThat generation doesn\u2019t believe that anyone has the right to define who they are to them, and that includes their sexuality, their sense of self, how they want to be, quote, \u2018branded\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cBoy, we were all raised so differently.\u201d It\u2019s become hackneyed to talk about self-actualisation, but Dern seems to be a living embodiment, a woman who might actually be able to say she\u2019s living her best life and mean it. \u201cWhat comes with this moment in life, for me, is a kind of sense of boldness that I thought I had in my 20s, that I was actually nowhere near,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I feel like I\u2019m ready to be an actor, now I feel I want to tackle anything. Now there\u2019s just a longing to explore more, dive deeper, find things that scare me. And go towards them.\u201d Big Little Lies starts on Sky Atlantic at 2am tomorrow morning, repeated at 9pm, exclusively on Sky Atlantic &amp; Now TV, courtesy of HBO Laura Dern\u2019s styling by Mary Inacio from The Wall Group; hair by Paul Norton at traceymattingly.com using IGK; makeup by Jo Strettell at traceymattingly.com using Serucell Skincare"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
