Criminologists know more than they would like to. So do poverty analysts and critics of the former Commons Speaker, Michael Martin, whose enforced resignation triggered the contest in this traditional Labour stronghold. Home to Barlinnie, Scotland's largest prison, it remains close to the top of many indices of deprivation, low skills and car ownership, high unemployment and social housing. The constituency also contains the Red Road high-rise flats, a 1960s symbol of renewal soon to be demolished. The heroine of Andrea Arnold's award-winning 2006 thriller, Red Road, worked in a local block. After 74 years of unbroken Labour hegemony in this estates-dominated corner of outer Glasgow, the collapse of railway manufacture, plus a disgraced local MP, it sounds like a recipe for change. That is certainly what the SNP has been campaigning for, though privately party strategists admit that their cheerful brand of aspirational politics \u2013 which worked when the Nats took neighbouring Glasgow East last July \u2013 is harder work in a constituency with such low expectations. Labour's candidate, local law lecturer Willie Bain, tells a different story. Unemployment may be on the rise, but it is barely half what it was in 1997. The boom years did touch the area \u2013 10 minutes by train from the thriving city centre jobs market \u2013 and much-needed skills training is under way. As for Lord Martin of Springburn, as he now is, plenty of voters, especially older ones, remember 30 years of small kindnesses. They see their local-boy-made-very-good as a victim of English Tory and media viciousness. Expenses and the Sun's take on the Afghan war do not register with an alienated electorate either. That is Labour's problem too, the familiar fear of a low turnout among core voters which has prompted 5,000 (typed) letters from Gordon Brown and plans to contact 6,000 voters by phone or on the doorstep by close of poll tomorrow night. Most observers and, implicitly, the politicians too, expect Bain to hold the seat against the SNP's David Kerr, a BBC journalist whose claims to be a local have prompted jokes about \"the man born in three places\". If there is an upset, some fear it will be the spectacle of the BNP \u2013 fighting its first fully staffed campaign in Scotland \u2013 coming third. Why? As native Glaswegians escape those high-rise flats they are filled with east Europeans and other newcomers, plus asylum seekers. Canvassers admit an anti-immigrant backlash also hurts the SNP. Martin's 2005 majority was 10,134 on a 45% turnout. But as Speaker the Tories and Lib Dems did not challenge him (the SNP did). Some predict a Labour win by 2,000. Scotland is Labour's most secure redoubt after 12 years in office. If Brown cannot hang on here it will be grim at the general election."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
