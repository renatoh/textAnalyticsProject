He has devoted an enormous amount of forensic energy and distinction-drawing, and on the whole, in a sort of abstract Cambridge-graduate way, has written quite a clever book. The real problem with it - and I have to say, I can't imagine anyone bothering to finish it unless they were paid to - is the usual problem with graduate theses. Halfway through, the author has evidently realised what the reader long ago concluded, that there is nothing much to say about the subject he long ago chose. Julius's characteristic manner does its best to conceal this, with its lining up of categories and sub-categories, its appearance of providing a useful map to a complex territory. But the longer it goes on, the more you wonder whether there is any territory here at all; all one can see is a bewildering set of distinctions and sub-distinctions, and the area in which Julius has chosen to exercise his ingenuity turns out to include, as far as I can see, pretty well anything at all. Transgression is a peculiarly unhelpful critical category. The subject seems to fall apart under the pitiless gaze of the critic. In the first place, works of art become less or more transgressive over time. Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe and Olympia, from which point Julius starts, outraged Manet's contemporaries with something now rather difficult to understand - the combination of nude and clothed figures. On the other hand, some other things have become far more shocking and offensive as time passes. We are probably much more shocked, for instance, by works of art which present children in a sexual context than was once the case; the Fragonard oil in Munich which depicts a young girl masturbating with her pet dog, or Henry James's What Maisie Knew now seem quite appalling. The whole idea of the 'transgressive' tends very quickly to disappear under what Julius describes as 'the canonic defence'. He has conflated two quite different arguments here, not very helpfully. The first is, as Julius sees, a rather disgraceful syllogism, and runs, roughly: 'King George V once said that C\u00e9zanne was a load of old rubbish; Mr Brian Sewell recently remarked that Tracey Emin's My Bed was also a load of old rubbish; therefore Tracey Emin is as great an artist as C\u00e9zanne.' But there is a different aspect to the 'canonic defence'. The novel and outrageous aspects of great art are what initially strike an audience; only subsequently does it become apparent that here is an artist concerned to continue and renew the achievements of the past. Manet's links with Vel\u00e1zquez have become apparent, and Damien Hirst's devotion to the vanitas theme will become so; in the process, any idea of them as transgressive will disappear, and it is difficult not to think that it was always a superficial misreading. The aesthetic category is, in short, no kind of guide to an artist's intentions, or to any kind of searching response to a work of art. Julius seems to waver between the absurd aesthete's position that all great art is transgressive and subversive, and a more limited idea of 'criminal' and 'law-abiding' artists. Certainly, it is very difficult to see, despite all his categories and connection-drawings, what these artists have in common. One paragraph, taken quite at random, goes from Courbet, through George Grosz, L\u00e9ger and Judy Chicago to Picasso. When artists engaged in such completely different endeavours are rammed into the same context, the reader starts to wonder at what point the critic actually looked at the work of art or took the trouble to work out, patiently, what was most interesting about each of them. That reaches a fairly ludicrous low point with Julius's lumping together of Chris Ofili, Gilbert and George and Piero Manzoni as artists who have worked with excrement. There is absolutely nothing which connects the visual experience of Manzoni's elegantly labelled tins of poo with Gilbert and George's vast photographs of the stuff. He just hasn't properly looked at the art. Certainly, the factitious and ephemeral category of 'transgressive' art is now so tempting to a critic that it leads to fairly gross misreadings of the most innocuous things. Marcus Harvey's famous portrait of Myra Hindley, for instance, aroused outrage, but it was difficult to see on what grounds; executed in the handprints of children, it struck me as a piece of lush, Victorian sentiment. And if some of the art here considered constitutes a deliberate outrage to bien-pensant thinking, much of it, like Max Ernst or Anselm Kiefer, is the most perfect embodiment of good taste and liberal pieties. Towards the end of this exhausting book, Julius starts to wonder whether transgressive art has exhausted itself. At this point - 'Seventhly' one paragraph annihilatingly begins - I started to lose track of what, if anything, he was saying, but it seemed to be a combination of two things. One was that art has pretty well exhausted all the things which used to be so shocking, in the willies-and-bums field. The other was that any pieties still hanging around ought to be left in peace; the example, which you will have seen coming a mile off, is the Holocaust. Both these propositions seem rather doubtful to me; much as one dislikes the piles of art-school cleverness on the subject of Nazism, one never knows when something really good will emerge from a school of general unrelieved dross. And it seems extremely unwise to suppose that art has exhausted its power to shock, on the basis that you can't imagine how such a shock could be orchestrated. I can't imagine either, but then, I am not an artist. But in the end, these seem trivial speculations. The fundamental problem with this book is that it approaches 'transgression' not as an incidental aspect of the work of art, but as a central part of its nature. A gossipy book about the outrage initially excited by Manet, Duchamp, Yves Klein and Emin might be worth reading; this, alas, is not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
