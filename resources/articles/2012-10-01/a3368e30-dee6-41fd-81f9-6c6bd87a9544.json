Grosjean has been involved in eight incidents this season, with five on the first lap, including the huge crash that put Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton out at Spa and resulted in a one-race ban. The reaction after he punted Mark Webber out in Japan on Sunday was widespread, negative and strongly suggestive that action against the driver should be taken. Webber himself branded him a \"nutcase\"; the Red Bull principal, Christian Horner, said that it was \"unacceptable\" and that \"his team need to get him under a bit more control\"; while Jenson Button said he should \"sort his shit out\". \"We can work with him,\" Boullier said. \"I speak to him. We try to create a tough environment because I need to push him, [but] he has to find it within himself, nobody else can do that. He understands what he did wrong. He has to because that needs to be fixed. We can just help him, but we cannot fix it.\" Grosjean is a quick driver and has put his car in the front five of the grid six times this season but has also gained a reputation for what Button described as being a \"win or crash\" driver, which Boullier also acknowledged. \"If you look at his career, he was always a little bit hot [hot-headed driver] but I thought if he got some confidence, then he would cool down. He [has] won championships before. That means he knows how to start a race and win a race. The only worry is to make sure he cools down.\" What little patience there was will have been further tested after Boullier's comments, because he is not only the French driver's boss but also effectively his manager, since the team principal is chief executive of Gravity Sports Management, which looks after the driver, and Boullier was personally instrumental in bringing him to Lotus. Nonetheless, the driver's seat for 2013 is not at risk, or at least Boullier said: \"Not yet. But I expect to see an improvement,\" while insisting that it was up to Grosjean to find ways improve. \"He needs to find what makes him relaxed and how to be good and to concentrate on the right person. He needs to find that balance. It is not about fixing things like the car setup, it is about trying to make the kid confident and self-aware so that he controls his starts.\" Grosjean acknowledged ahead of the next race, here in South Korea on Sunday, that he would be under scrutiny and that he had to do better. \"It was a stupid mistake,\" he said. \"Mark [Webber] came to see me after the race and was obviously not happy, but I apologised and we have to move on. I've sat down and looked at things again with the team; it's still an area we need to improve. We're clearly focusing on this area for the next races.\" Boullier added: \"We have been speaking to him, especially since Spa. I think he will eventually learn.\" However, it is the somewhat nebulous \"eventually\" that will concern many drivers, especially at the business end of the grid. With five races to go and only four points separating Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel in the world championship, a potentially thrilling end to the season may be ruined should either be knocked out in Korea at the first corner. Alonso's principal, Stefano Domenicali, meanwhile, has admitted his team must push development harder if they are to match Red Bull in the fight for the title. \"We need to think differently now, because that race advantage is not there. But it [the title fight] is still in our control,\" he said. With the points cushion Alonso had enjoyed until his failures to finish in Belgium and Japan now gone, Domenicali noted that it was imperative Ferrari move up the grid. \"We saw Red Bull this weekend was impressive, so we need to see what we can do to match their development \u2013 or see if this track was better for them. We need to keep the positive pressure on our engineers to make sure we deliver the development,\" he said. \"When I hear that we have not developed the car for many grands prix, it is not true. The truth is that the level of development is very high, but we need to start higher because when you start there [in the middle of the grid] anything can happen.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
