After talks with two out of three union leaders, Mr Eddington said: \"We have had a very sensible and very positive exchange. The important thing is that we need negotiators to get back around the table and reach a sensible, negotiated settlement.\" Mr Eddington first met Kevin Curran, general secretary of the GMB union, for 35 minutes, and then Paul Talbot, assistant general secretary of Amicus, for 50 minutes. The GMB has taken the most hard-line position on the introduction of swipe cards as part of an automated clocking in system, but the verdict from both Mr Eddington and Mr Curran on today's session was upbeat. Management's decision to implement swipe cards prompted 250 ground staff to walk out two weekends ago, throwing BA's Heathrow operations into chaos. Although before today's talks Mr Curran accused management of losing the trust of its employees, he later agreed that the discussions had been held in a \"very positive environment\" and said the union looked forward to resuming talks at Acas, the independent arbitration organisation, tomorrow. Differences between GMB, Amicus and the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU), the other union involved in the dispute, have complicated the task of getting a settlement and Brendan Barber, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, is to step in to try and forge a common position. If he succeeds, Mr Barber is likely to lead negotiations with BA managers at Acas. Mr Eddington's personal intervention in the controversy underlines what is at stake. A strike later this summer at the height of the travelling season could deal a fatal blow to BA as it struggles to recover from the worst aviation crisis in history. This week Mr Eddington is expected to report first quarter pre-tax losses of between \u00a350m and \u00a370m because of the impact of the Sars virus, the Iraq war and weak global recovery. BA has yet to tally the cost of the strike, saying only that it has cost tens of millions of pounds. Analysts put the cost as high as \u00a350m, which would push BA's losses for the year to \u00a3150m and knock back its recovery programme. In another blow to BA, the company received more than twice as many complaints last year as the year before. Passenger complaints made to the Air Transport Users Council against BA in the 12 months ending March 2003 totalled 257 compared with 117 in the previous 12 months, the council said. This put BA at the top of the council's airline complaints table, with Ryanair second."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
