Nick Boles launched an extraordinary attack on his party leader on Twitter, listing the controversy over the release of John Worboys, the housing crisis and NHS funding as key areas of concern. The politician has been delivering a critique of government policy in recent months through the publication of a series of chapters from his new book, Square Deal, about how to revitalise modern Conservatism. But he appeared to snap over the decision of the justice secretary, David Gauke, not to seek a judicial review into the Parole Board\u2019s decision to free Worboys after less than 10 years in prison. The 60-year-old taxi driver was jailed in 2009 for assaults on 12 women in London. The government had looked into the possibility of a legal challenge but decided against it after consulting lawyers. Boles told the Guardian: \u201cWe need ministers to have the courage of their convictions and not be bamboozled by the advice of officials trying to justify the system.\u201d It came after he tweeted: The MP, who returned to constituency work in September after battling cancer, argued that the Worboys decision was the final straw because a judicial review would have been an opportunity for ministers to express their anger. He said they should have pushed ahead even if there was only a 10% chance of victory. His book has called for a bolder approach to economic, housing and health policy, demanding the Tories bring an end to the \u201cage of austerity\u201d and focus on investment and driving up productivity. The former skills minister said that would help tackle the lack of growth in wages. He has also suggested re-branding national insurance to fund the NHS and social care. Boles, who was a key figure in Michael Gove\u2019s unsuccessful leadership bid, told the Sun that he wanted Downing Street to \u201cpull their finger out\u201d and for May to lead, be bold and definite. \u201cWhen I came back, I said we needed a new story, a new set of ambitions. I put it in friendly terms and I just feel we\u2019re moving backwards,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
