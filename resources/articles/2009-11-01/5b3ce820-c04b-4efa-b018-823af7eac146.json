Paul Unwin and Sarah Beck's piece is a heartfelt attempt to capture the fall-out, including fragmented testimony from witnesses, police (particularly assistant commissioner Andy Hayman), lawyers, family, friends and Justice4Jean campaigners. It's beautifully acted and contains much that is powerful, but it is so kaleidoscopic and wide-ranging that the impact of the piece is often negated by a lack of clarity and focus. Curiously, a great deal of the film footage feels more compelling than what happens on stage, which is blighted by some self-consciously tricksy bits of \"this isn't theatre, this is real\" business. Towards the end, when the Stockwell shrine is suddenly recreated, you are aware that your heartstrings are being tugged a little too hard \u2013 as if the director knows that the show might have stirred our sense of injustice, but hasn't earned our tears. This Much Is True offers little that hasn't been reported elsewhere, apart from the terrifying suggestion from one policeman that Sky News is often the Met's main source of information when a major incident is unfolding. What it has is a direct conduit to the family, who are played with quiet authority by Stefano Braschi, Alice da Cunha and Beatriz Romilly. But even here you wonder if the interviews might have been better served in a fictionalised context because although this verbatim show stakes a claim to the truth, there is much more to theatre than facts. Until 21 November. Box office: 020-7978 7040."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
