That he does as naturally as a dog cocks its leg at a lamppost. This week, he has used the bodies of those murdered at London Bridge as props for his election campaign. Last week the 55-year-old dodged a Channel 4 debate on climate change, sending instead his dad and his wingman, Michael Gove. And then there are his many columns, spitting at gay men (\u201ctank-topped bumboys\u201d), single mums (\u201cuppity and irresponsible\u201d) and black people (\u201csmiling piccaninnies\u201d). I would go on, but equally so might you \u2013 and we both know what typically comes next. The performative pearl-clutching, the saucer-eyed wailing: \u201cHow could he?\u201d The sound and rote fury on social media and rolling news, followed by a satisfied, full-bellied silence as grateful journalists wait for their next steaming dollop of Boris buffoonery. It passes time and it pads out columns, but it is no way to scrutinise the man who may well be our next prime minister, in charge of taking Britain out of Europe into a new era of foreign and trade relations \u2013 and rewriting our political, economic and social settlement. With the president of America strutting around London this week, the comparison is inevitable. Over this election, Johnson is playing the media and the public just as Trump did before claiming the White House in 2016. Both men are adept at exploiting the media appetite for offence over ideas, for name-calling in place of nuance. Trump calls Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d; Johnson likens Jeremy Corbyn to Stalin. Ridiculous, of course, but enough kindling for at least two days\u2019 headlines. The US president calls his counterpart in No 10 Britain Trump, and both men have made the same calculation. The cash-strapped media needs eyeballs, and these two enjoy having all eyes on them \u2013 so they grab coverage and set the terms of the debate. If Johnson makes a show of himself, at least he\u2019s the star. When he has a car crash, websites thank him for the traffic. With the biggest UK newspaper groups already behind him, the Conservative leader thus ensures he gets both total control of the message from his friends and the total attention of everyone else. Who cares if they call him Pinocchio? As a journalist he made his name with tales taller than Michael Jordan \u2013 yarns about how Brussels was designating snails as fish, or imposing a maximum size on condoms. Decades before Mark Zuckerberg came along, Johnson had already gleaned the attention economy\u2019s golden rule: professional reputation matters less than providing distraction. Did anyone say zip wire? This is nothing to do with appearing prime ministerial: it\u2019s about grabbing power. Like Trump, Johnson has no interest in wooing all bases. I have written here before about how the Old Etonian has gone from being Heineken \u2013 the politician who reaches the parts of the electorate other Tories cannot reach \u2013 to utter Marmite. Now he pursues a political strategy for a polarised country that deliberately seeks to divide it further by treating the other side as anti-national. You want Brexit, or you\u2019re part of the remoaner elite. You want spending cuts, or you can bugger off to Venezuela. The critics are so busy fact-checking his fibs that there\u2019s less time and energy to investigate the inconvenient truth. Crucial arguments about his eligibility for office are sacrificed instead for coverage of his latest gaffe. Policy loses out to political etiquette. Opponents in the media become mere accomplices. And so one of the most significant electoral choices of our lifetime is drained of consequence. With his plans for a disastrously hard Brexit, his stated enthusiasm for tax cuts for the rich and his team schooled in the dark-money thinktanks of the transatlantic ultra rightwing, Johnson poses a serious threat to the British way of life. The details of the Whitehall-Washington trade talks released by Labour last week make that clear. Whatever the nervous denials from Trump and Johnson this week, everything from the food we eat to our rights at work to the state\u2019s commitment to fight climate chaos spills across the boardroom table, ready to be bargained away. Yet voters see not a danger, but a clown. Focus groups told the pollster Michael Ashcroft last month that Johnson would most probably spend a spare Friday night \u201cshagging his secretary\u201d. \u201cThere would be apologies the next morning.\u201d Boys will be boys, especially those from the Bullingdon club. There will be less laughter if he gets in. Look at the Institute for Fiscal Studies analysis of the Tory manifesto. Barely covered on the BBC or in the press, it gives the lie to those studio-sofa cliches about both parties \u201cbidding to see who can spend the most\u201d. Instead, it calculates that a Johnson government will spend less, day to day, on everything outside the NHS \u2013 which is to say crucial things such as teachers or social security or care for the elderly, than 2010 levels \u2013 even as the fallout from his Brexit crash sucks jobs and money out of the private sector. A decade of cuts may have pushed your schools, your libraries, your councils to breaking point \u2013 but Johnson will ensure austerity carries on well into the next decade. In their guide to this new age of autocracy, How Democracies Die, the Harvard political scientists Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt compile a checklist titled \u201cKey indicators of authoritarian behavior\u201d. Intended to illustrate Trump\u2019s assault on democratic norms, it should serve as warning of how far Johnson may dismantle the UK\u2019s own checks and balances. \u201cDo they reject the Constitution or express a willingness to violate it?\u201d the checklist begins. And one recalls Johnson\u2019s attempted prorogation of parliament that the supreme court ruled unlawful, and the ominous line in the Tory manifesto that pledges to \u201clook at the broader aspects of our constitution\u201d. Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement grants him so-called Henry VIII powers to change laws after Brexit without needing to pass a fresh act of parliament. As a House of Lords report last month shows, workers\u2019 rights and governance of Northern Ireland will be in his hands. \u201cDo they baselessly suggest that their rivals are foreign agents?\u201d Remember Johnson accusing Corbyn of \u201csiding with the Russian spin machine\u201d simply for wanting evidence over the Salisbury poisoning? \u201cHave they threatened to take legal or other punitive action against \u2026 the media?\u201d After Channel 4 editors swapped no-show Johnson with an ice sculpture at last Thursday\u2019s party leaders\u2019 debate, No 10 threatened to review the broadcaster\u2019s licence. Were such things happening in another state, especially outside the west, our journalists would be quick to talk about autocracy. Urgent protests would pour forth from NGOs and politicians, perhaps including our prime minister. Inside our borders it is harder to find such clarity of perspective, yet the danger is visible. Johnson may be a rogue, but what should worry us is that he is a risk to our economy, society and democracy. His bad manners should not distract from the fact he is a bad man. Treat this election as some kind of joke, and we may laugh ourselves into plummy-voiced, perma-smirking, tousle-haired despotism. \u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
