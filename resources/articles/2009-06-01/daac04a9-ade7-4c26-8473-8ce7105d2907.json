David Price, Bond's solicitor, refused to comment when asked by this column why Bond had dropped the case. But Bond's decision not to pursue his attempt to clear his name will remain with him throughout his career. A pre-trial judgment by the judge, Lord Justice Eady, which discusses the facts in the case states that while making his claim against the BBC, he accepted the programme \"conveyed the impression that [he] was, on camera while being covertly recorded, expressing interest in prospectively receiving an impermissible payment (or 'bung')\". At the time of the undercover recording Bond was serving as Harry Redknapp's assistant manager at Portsmouth. When the programme was broadcast, he was Glenn Roeder's assistant manager at Newcastle United but was sacked shortly after the programme went out. The Panorama programme showed footage of a conversation involving Bond and an undercover reporter: \"I totally understand where you're coming from. I understand what you're looking for, and certainly myself and Harry would be open to listening to, you know, in order to come to some arrangement, if you like, where whatever we need, we'll make sure that we call you, and what you really want is that we call you and only you.\" Bond is again Redknapp's assistant, now at Tottenham Hotspur. The BBC has not apologised, paid damages or any of his legal fees. Zola may have to sell West Ham United's new owner, Straumur, is unable to explain how it will cover club losses without selling players. The club's auditors, Deloitte, has refused to sign off West Ham's accounts while the Icelandic bank is only permitted to trade due to standstill agreements with its creditors. But those accounts are believed to show West Ham made a loss in excess of \u00a310m for the 2007-08 season and even more pressure comes next year. Compensation of \u00a35m will become payable to Sheffield United, there is uncertainty over incomes from Setanta's collapsing broadcast deal and a massive increase in wage bills associated with the 20% hike in top-rate tax. Straumur executives told creditors last week it \"has no access to capital\" and access to debt finance is likely to be tight for some time. Without an owner to guarantee losses, Gianfranco Zola is expected to be forced to sell players to keep the club afloat. One curious result of the meltdown in Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson's empire is that the former West Ham United owner, whose financial difficulties caused all the current uncertainty at Upton Park, remains a shareholder in the club's parent company. A 15% share of CB [Claret and Blue] Holding, the vehicle through which the banks assumed control of West Ham, is owned 15% by Landsbanki, Grettir and Samson \u2013 the latter two being Gudmundsson investment vehicles who as creditors of Hansa are entitled to an equity stake. Both are bankrupt with court-appointed assistants now in charge. Since their largest creditor is Landsbanki it is expected their stakes will be subsumed into Landsbanki's holding without a penny going to Gudmundsson Liverpool party shame Internet footage of the Spirit of Shankly group's end-of-season party at the Olympia in Liverpool a fortnight ago has sparked outrage in Manchester after a musician at the event was captured on film starting a chant about Munich. Standing beneath a 12-foot high Spirit of Shankly banner, the singer's chant is apparently joined by hundreds in the room. The individual who placed the footage on Youtube commented: \"I think they've disgraced the 96 who so tragically died at Hillsborough when they mock the dead like this.\" In expressing that the SOS group is \"sincerely sorry\" for the episode, the group said in a statement: \"This footage shows an unscheduled performance which the SOS Events Committee had no prior knowledge of. [It] will endeavour to increase back\u2011stage security for future events to ensure impromptu performances like this do not happen again.\" But that does not explain how the singer was allowed to remain on stage for at least five minutes afterwards. A spokesman did not return calls. Knight becomes a Pilgrim Sir Roy Gardner, the erstwhile chairman of the mighty Manchester United, is set to be installed as non-executive chairman of Plymouth Argyle. Once one of the few knights in the Premier League boardroom, Gardner's air of superiority ensured he was never the most popular figure in football. With respect to the Home Park club, the destination of his return to the game \u2013 courtesy of an investment alongside Yasuaki Kagami's Shonan Management Corporation \u2013 has already begun to amuse his former sparring partners. matt.scott@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
