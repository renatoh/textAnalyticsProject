Timber Falls is another horror flick in which unwary city folk venture into the backwoods in an attempt to commune with nature and end up at the unnatural mercy of unspeakable locals. In this case, a professional couple from Alexandria, a genteel Virginia suburb of Washington DC, set out for a weekend hike in the woods of the impoverished neighbouring state of West Virginia. After a frightening encounter with three degenerate mountain men, they meet an apparently kindly husband and wife who just happen to be religious maniacs with a Christian shrine and a torture chamber in a secret cellar beneath their log cabin. It is a leering, bloody, sadistic affair made by people who understand the audience for this. Innocent moviegoers straying into this film at their local multiplex will be shouting out for deliverance or, in the case of the more sophisticated among them, for Deliverance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
