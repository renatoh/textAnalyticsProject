After Pep Guardiola\u2019s pre-game stance that the Brazilian and Sergio Ag\u00fcero have to compete to be his centre-forward this was a big chance to bid for a place when Wolves visit on Monday. Turn in the kind of high-energy display his manager loves and Jesus might begin to convince Guardiola he should dislodge Ag\u00fcero, who was absent owing to flu but is expected to train on Thursday. And if he could add to his eight strikes the case could be made stronger \u2013 and Guardiola\u2019s choice more difficult. The 21-year-old\u2019s tally when the Carabao Cup semi-final against Burton started \u2013 from 24 appearances \u2013 compared unfavourably with Ag\u00fcero\u2019s, which stands at 12 in 21: numbers that make him the first-choice. Staying out of the treatment room has proved difficult for Jesus since his arrival in January 2017 from Palmeiras for \u00a328m. A serious foot injury that spring was followed by a serious knee problem last spring: two maladies that allowed Ag\u00fcero back into the reckoning, with Guardiola\u2019s instinct being to prefer Jesus when both are available. Despite these interruptions his tallies in his first two seasons in England were impressive. Jesus\u2019s seven from 10, and 13 from 29 appearances, 0.97 and 0.7 strikes per game, respectively, showed his quality. These compared to Ag\u00fcero\u2019s 20 in 31, and 21 in 25, in the same 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons: 0.75 and 0.96 goals per game. Yet this year Jesus\u2019s numbers have fallen off dramatically: only three of his eight goals have been in the league, in 16 outings, at only 0.38 per match. For Ag\u00fcero 10 of his 12 have come in the league, from 17 appearances, at 0.72 goals per game. This has raised questions about Jesus\u2019s status more than once at Guardiola\u2019s media briefings. The manager\u2019s usual way of answering is to point to the player\u2019s all-round contribution and to express the belief that his goal count will rise again. It certainly did here. On a quarter of an hour Jesus gave an illustration of the first point, dropping back to the centre circle to take the ball, feed it, and race into the area, only for Leroy San\u00e9\u2019s cross to miss his run as he pulled away from a melee near the goal. His movement \u2013 pulling away to the left and then darting inside \u2013 was bright, but a scuffed shot that gave Bradley Collins in Burton\u2019s goal no cause for alarm was illustrative of his lack of potency. Soon, though, he did show a marksman\u2019s instinct. Kevin De Bruyne had opened the scoring after five minutes and now, on the half-hour, Jesus reacted before four yellow-shirted opponents after San\u00e9\u2019s shot was repelled by Collins and that was 2-0. This one came from his head and a second arrived minutes later, this time with the left foot. Ag\u00fcero, now, may have begun fretting about his place. In what was becoming a duck-shoot for City in the wake of Oleksandr Zinchenko\u2019s 30-yard lob to make it 4-0, the task for Jesus was to keep pressing his claim. After City awoke from a brief slumber early in the second half he did precisely that. Riyad Mahrez chipped in and there was Jesus for a second headed finish and second hat-trick of the campaign, following the three in November\u2019s 6-0 drubbing of Shakhtar Donetsk here in the Champions League. More was to come. Jesus added his fourth and City\u2019s seventh with a neat turn home from San\u00e9\u2019s low cross, while Phil Foden (City\u2019s fifth), Kyle Walker (eighth) and finally Mahrez completed a 9-0 rout, better than Saturday\u2019s 7-0 FA Cup win over Rotherham and the biggest win of the Guardiola era. Now he will assess Jesus and Ag\u00fcero and decide who should face Wolves. A third option for Guardiola is to select both his star forwards as he has previously but if he picks only one it will be fascinating to see who he plumps for. As the second phase of the season starts to unfold, it is a good problem to have. Afterwards Guardiola said: \u201cStrikers need goals.\u201d Jesus plundered Burton for plenty of them on Wednesday night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
