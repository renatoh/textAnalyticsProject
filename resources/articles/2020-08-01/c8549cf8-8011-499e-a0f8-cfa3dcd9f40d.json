The club said the agreement was made with the understanding the 25-year-old central midfielder \u201cis expected to sign an agreement to play outside the NWSL with immediate effect\u201d, meaning the Spirit will be compensated for her departure while the Reign will control her rights if she decides to return to the NWSL in the future. Lavelle, who has won 35 caps for the US women\u2019s national team and scored 12 international goals, has been in talks to join Manchester City of the FA Women\u2019s Super League, who last week signed fellow American star Sam Mewis. The Athletic reported late Sunday that Lavelle\u2019s one-year contract with City is \u201cofficially a go\u201d with a formal announcement to follow this week. The Cincinnati native was the breakout star of last year\u2019s World Cup, starting six of her team\u2019s seven matches, scoring three goals and winning the Bronze Ball as the third-best player in the competition behind team-mate Megan Rapinoe and England\u2019s Lucy Bronze. Her left-footed strike in the final against the Netherlands to seal her country\u2019s fourth world championship was hailed as an instant classic. A stylish playmaker adept at breaking opponents\u2019 back lines with her creativity, vision and technical skill, Lavelle made 21 appearances across all competitions in three seasons with Washington while battling frequent hamstring injuries, most recently helping the club to the quarter-finals of the NWSL Challenge Cup. \u201cOur project with OL Reign is ambitious, which requires taking smart, strategic risks to achieve our objectives,\u201d OL Reign head coach Farid Benstiti said in a statement. \u201cWe all know that Rose is a special player, so for me this is a chance we had to take. I very much hope that we will have the chance to work with Rose in the future, and I am excited about supporting her as she works to achieve her destiny as one of the best players in the world.\u201d Lavelle\u2019s agent did not immediately reply to a request for comment from the Guardian."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
