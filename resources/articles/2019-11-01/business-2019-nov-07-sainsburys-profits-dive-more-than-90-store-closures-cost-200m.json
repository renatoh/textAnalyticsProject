The UK\u2019s second largest grocer said pretax profits dived more than 90% to \u00a39m in the six months to 21 September after the one-off property write-down, compared with \u00a3107m in the same period a year before. It also spent \u00a325m in redundancy costs related to reorganising store management and closing an Argos delivery depot as the supermarket steps up integration with the catalogue shop it acquired in 2016. The write-down follows Sainsbury\u2019s announcement two months ago that it would close up to 70 Argos stores and replace them with outlets inside its supermarkets. It is also closing a net five supermarkets and will shut 40 convenience stores, although it intends to open 100 new ones. Even if one-off costs are excluded, profits fell 15% to \u00a3238m as sales slipped by 0.2% to \u00a316.8bn. However, Mike Coupe, the chief executive, said Sainsbury\u2019s had \u201ccreated positive momentum\u201d with price cuts and investments in large beauty areas, premium ready meals and exclusive partnerships with brands such as the fast-food business Leon. The supermarket blamed poor weather compared with last year for a 0.1% fall in grocery sales over the half year. It said sales had risen by 0.6% in the most recent three months after it cut prices on 1,000 of its bestselling products since February. The grocer has ditched its cheapest Basics range in favour of 200 low-price products under new in-house labels including Stamford Street ready meals, Mary Ann\u2019s Dairy and Greengrocer fruit and veg. Clothing sales rose by 3.3% and general merchandise sales fell by 2%. Coupe said the retail market was highly competitive and the outlook for consumer confidence was uncertain as a result of the forthcoming general electionand the continuing Brexit debate. He said it was unclear how an election so close to Christmas would affect sales as this had not happened since 1923, but that consumer sentiment was still soft and appeared to have become poorer as a result of the difficult political backdrop. \u201cPeople will still have a great Christmas and spend their money,\u201d he said, but added: \u201cThe sooner we can resolve our future [in relation to Brexit] the better. Ultimately that\u2019s what will fuel consumer confidence and retail in the UK.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s and the other traditional supermarkets, including Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Waitrose, have all had to slash prices on basic groceries while trying to improve service, as discounters including Aldi, Lidl, B&amp;M and Home Bargains have all expanded rapidly in recent years. Richard Lim, the chief executive of the analysis firm Retail Economics, said: \u201cBlaming the weather and higher marketing expenses suggests there is significant pressure on profit margins bubbling under the surface. There\u2019s no getting away from the fact that sales fell across all parts of the business, reflecting tough market conditions. \u201cHowever, the integration of Argos appears to be progressing well. It offers a truly attractive proposition for customers who increasingly bounce across physical and digital channels, often at the same time.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s had wanted to improve efficiency through a merger with Asda, the UK\u2019s third largest supermarket, but the \u00a37bn deal was blocked by competition regulators this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
