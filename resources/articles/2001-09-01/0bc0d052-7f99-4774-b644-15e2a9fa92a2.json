However, ABI added that the catastrophe may cost US insurers billions of dollars. \"It's obviously too early to say yet what the full impact on the UK insurance industry will be,\" said a spokesperson for The Association of British Insurers. \"We do understand, however, that the exposure of the UK insurance market to any costs incurred from the US tragedy will be very limited.\" Despite this, yesterday's events will have some impact on the global insurance market - and not just on US firms. A spokeswoman for The International Underwriting Association said the cost to insurance groups was likely to run into billions of US dollars. She said: \"It could be $20bn [\u00a313.5bn] but that is a broad figure. It is definitely looking like billions of US dollars but we are reluctant to give figures at this point. We are still trying to work out who and what was insured.\" All types of insurance including aviation, terrorism, property and lost business would be facing claims as a result of the disaster. She said most of the direct risks would be insured in the US, but added that most insurance companies would be reinsured against the risk with other firms, some of which could be in the London market, though at this stage it was not known which companies were involved. Swiss reinsurance giant Swiss Re said it was facing \u00a31bn (\u00a3700m) in claims from the terrorist strike, though the full extent of its liabilities were still to be determined. Lloyds of London, the insurance market giant, would not comment on the extent of its exposure as it was still assessing the impact. But it said it expected to be in a position to say within the next 24 hours. A spokeswoman at Royal &amp; Sun Alliance said it was far too early to tell what the impact would be on the insurance industry and whether it would lead to an increase in premiums. Ian Frater, at CGNU, said it was going to take time for the group to work out what its exposure was. He said: \"We did pull out of the States earlier this year in property and casualty business but we have to look at the arrangements of insurance and reinsurance before we know what our exposure is.\" One analyst, who did not want to be named, said he thought UK exposure to the terrorist attack would be limited, and companies were more likely to feel the impact indirectly through falls in their stock market investments. Another analyst added it was thought that UK companies had only limited exposure, which was likely to run into the tens of millions of dollars rather than hundreds of millions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
