Fisherman offer fresh yellowfin tuna, mackerel and parrot fish, swatting away flies with banana leaves. Stalls are coloured by tropical fruits and the floral dresses of Solomon Islands women who have arrived from villages to sell their produce. Some of the best produce found in the market, which is located in the capital of the island of Malaita in the Solomon Islands, comes from Adaliua Taiwanese Farm, situated three kilometres away. There, plump pawpaw and watermelon grow, surrounded by coconut palms. When the Guardian visits, one man uses his machete to slice a pineapple, using banana leaves as a plate to share the fruit. But the future of the farm and the jobs it creates was thrown into doubt overnight in September when Manasseh Sogavare, the prime minister of the Solomon Islands announced Honiara would end its 36-year relationship with Taiwan, and officially recognise Beijing. A few weeks later Sogavare received a warm welcome in Beijing, returning to the Solomons having signed five memoranda of understanding, including an agreement for China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative and having secured a promise from China to build a multi-million dollar stadium in the country. Chinese companies were also granted the right to build infrastructure, roads, bridges and power in order to revive Gold Ridge, once Solomon Islands\u2019 most lucrative goldmine; and a Chinese company attempted to lease the entire Solomons\u2019 island of Tulagi. The decision to switch allegiances to China sent ripples around the world. It incensed US senators, outraged the Taiwanese, influenced Kiribati to also abandon Taiwan less than two weeks later, and caused headaches for Australia at a time when Beijing\u2019s influence in the Pacific appears to be expanding. Now, just 15 countries recognise Taiwan. Professor Matthew Clarke of Deakin University says the Solomon Islands\u2019 recognition of Beijing is an important step for China in completing its Belt &amp; Road Initiative (BRI), a multi-trillion dollar initiative that aims to direct global trade through mainland China. \u201cThe Pacific is an important region in terms of maritime movements \u2026 being able to utilise ports for both commercial and presumedly military purposes is important to China,\u201d he says. But the decision has not unfolded smoothly. In the weeks following, four cabinet members who didn\u2019t back the move were sacked and one more resigned. A Christian nation of 600,000 people that lies 1,800km east of northern Australia, many Solomon Islanders fear China\u2019s oppression of religious minorities is incongruous with their way of life. Some worry Honiara\u2019s institutions are incapable of dealing with the world\u2019s largest nation. Others lament the exit of Taiwan, a friend which stuck with Solomon Islands, even during its civil war. For many, the impact of the change is direct and personal. John Oka sells botera, a local yellow-skinned fruit, from a modest stall in Auki. \u201cThe new generation \u2026 they don\u2019t want China, they want Taiwan,\u201d he says. Misak, the shirtless manager of Adaliua, has not heard from the Solomon Islands\u2019 government about the future of his farm. \u201cWe will not agree with our government with the shift to China. We still maintain our allegiance and support our premier,\u201d he says, speaking behind a barbed wire fence surrounding the farm. Sam Sudulakia, a 40-year old English-teacher, says the supervisor of the project has gone back to Taiwan. As Sudulakia speaks, Stephen Donga, 71, appears, carrying a machete and small axe used for farming. \u201cWhat about you people in Australia, would you mind help us continue with the farm?\u201d Donga asks. \u2018Money is always involved\u2019 Sitting at the Mendana Hotel on Honiara\u2019s foreshore as a gentle swell laps against a seawall, Peter Kenilorea Jr says he believes money is at the heart of the diplomatic switch. Young, eloquent and the son of Solomon Islands\u2019 first prime minister, Kenilorea \u2013 or Junior as he is affectionately known \u2013 is the deputy leader of the opposition and calls the government\u2019s move a \u201cslap in the face of the parliamentary process\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s an open secret that there\u2019s always money involved in these things. Hard evidence is another issue,\u201d says Kenilorea, sitting in the shade of coconut trees as, in the distance, Taiwanese-flagged ships sit idle at port. Kenilorea says he has heard reports of MPs being offered between SBD$2m-$5m ($246,000-$615,000) to vote in favour of Beijing. Daniel Sudaini, the premier of Malaita, one of Solomon Islands\u2019 largest and most populous provinces, was among those leaders who took a firm stand against Beijing and claims offers were made to him to soften his position. \u201cBefore the switch was made\u2026 there is a group of people or maybe someone who called me on the phone to give me an offer so I can support the switch. But I decided not to because if I accept the offer I\u2019m not representing the people. \u201cThey were offering an amount of money, telling me on the phone if you join us there\u2019s a package here.\u201d Sudaini says that his accusation is now the subject of a formal inquiry by Solomon Islands\u2019 police commissioner and so he can\u2019t go into more detail about the offer, but the Solomon Star reported that Sudaini claimed the bribe he was offered was SBD$1m ($123,000). In a statement, China\u2019s foreign ministry said the establishment of diplomatic ties with the Solomon Islands had been an \u201copen and above board\u201d process. \u201cNo rumour or slander will affect the development of friendly relations between China and the Solomon Islands,\u201d it said. A 2017 report by Transparency International found Solomon Islands to be \u201cvery corrupt\u201d, having \u201cweak accountability and integrity institutions\u201d. Titus Fika, a government MP who led the taskforce that ended up recommending Honiara make the switch, said any claims of corruption from the Beijing camp were not true. He said the group \u2013 made up of three government MPs, three opposition MPs and one independent MP \u2013 based their decision on the facts and by looking around at other Pacific nations that have relationships with China, which are more economically advanced than the Solomon Islands. But Fika alleges he was approached by Taiwan with a bribe. \u201cTaiwan wanted to bribe [me]. They wanted to give us $1m to sign for Taiwan then after we sign for Taiwan we will receive another [$1m] into our account,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t work, because we don\u2019t sign for it, because we want to do the right thing, not to for our own interest but for the country\u2019s interest and our constituency interests.\u201d In a statement to the Guardian, Taiwan rejected Fika\u2019s accusation. \u201cUnder no circumstances will Taiwan resort to an ugly dollar diplomacy bidding war with China, much less line the pockets of corrupt politicians,\u201d said Joanne Ou, a spokesperson for Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \u2018I didn\u2019t sleep since the switch\u2019 The impact of the decision by the government was immediate and angry. Taiwan\u2019s president Tsai Ing-wen issued a statement saying \u201cWe sincerely regret and strongly condemn their government\u2019s decision to establish diplomatic relations with China. \u201cIt is indeed regrettable that their unfinished cooperative projects must come to an end, and it is a loss for Solomon Islands people. However, this is the choice that Solomon Islands\u2019 government has made, leaving us with no other option but to respond in this way,\u201d she said. For Georgia Luilamo, the result was devastating. The 23-year-old is one of more than 100 Solomon Islander students who had been given prestigious scholarships to study at Taiwanese universities. After the break with Taiwan, all the scholarships were terminated, something they found out about by reading the newspaper. The students, enrolled in everything from medicine to politics to business to biotech were given until January to leave Taiwan. \u201cI didn\u2019t even sleep \u2026 since the switch,\u201d says Patricia Luilamo, Georgia\u2019s mother in Honiara. Patricia says her daughter and other Solomons\u2019 students have been offered spots at mainland Chinese universities, with the government saying their scholarships would continue to be paid. But Patricia says she has seen no details about this move: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing from China; there\u2019s nothing from Solomon Islands.\u201d Most students are fearful about moving to universities located in cities they\u2019d never heard of and few have complied. Patricia now faces using her small savings, money her husband left her when he died last year, to pay for her daughter\u2019s tuition. \u2018You cannot yoke a cat with an elephant\u2019 The people of the island of Malaita, an independently-minded and pro-Taiwan part of the country, are angry not only at the Sogavare Government\u2019s decision, but the way it was made. In the wake of the news, Sogavare dispatched Malaitan MPs within his government back to their constituencies to explain the government\u2019s position. Video circulating on social media shows the degree of public anger faced by the MPs, who were met with vocal condemnation as they travelled the province. \u201cI think Prime Minister Sogavare should go and tell people in [the] community and after he declared that he [can] make change,\u201d says David, 32, who sells betel nut at a wooden stand in central Auki. Weeks earlier, David was one of an estimated 500 Malaitans who protested against the switch. Next to his betel nuts, he still proudly displays his hand-made sign he carried to the rally: \u201cNo Need China.\u201d As in Honiara, a majority of small businesses in Auki are owned and operated by ethnic-Chinese, many first and second generation immigrants to Solomon Islands. But their presence has long caused tension and in 2006, Chinese businesses in Honiara were infamously ransacked following accusations of Beijing\u2019s influence in that year\u2019s election. There is concern that the anti-China sentiment is not just driven by pro-democracy sentiment but also by anti-China racism. One of the rioters that day was Richard Olita, the bearded, burly 35-year-old secretary of Malaita for Democracy, an anti-Beijing Malaitan independence movement. \u201cYou cannot yoke a cat with an elephant. China is too big for us\u201d, says Olita. \u201cGiven the weak economy, and the weak country, even the institutions of this country, it\u2019s not strong, so we cannot work with China. They will just overpower us.\u201d Malaita for Democracy doesn\u2019t just want to stop Malaita forming a relationship with Beijing, they want existing Chinese businesses in Auki expelled from the province and are using their influence to try and get the provincial government to do this. Already, Sudaini\u2019s provincial government has pledged to prohibit businesses \u201cdirectly or indirectly linked to the Chinese Communist Party\u201d from obtaining Malaitan business licenses and closed at least one Chinese-owned store. Despite Honiara severing ties with Taiwan, some hope Auki can still cobble together some form of relationship with Taipei. Taiwan has not ruled out such an arrangement. \u201cAs long as relations are built on a foundation of equality and mutual assistance for mutual benefit, we do not rule out any possibilities,\u201d says Ou. \u201cHowever, we do not have any plans for future cooperation at this time.\u201d Fears Savo could be leased to China A small volcanic clump 35km off the coast of the Honiara, Savo has a population of just 4,000 people, who maintain their own language, Savo Savo, and culture entirely distinct from neighbouring islands. Islanders travel by foot from village to village. There are no motorised vehicles or television on the island. Children spend their afternoons paddling dugout canoes and fishing in turquoise waters, while adults still re-construct thatched-roofed, bamboo framed huts that were decimated by Tropical Cyclone Mona in January. But over the last few months the islanders have been worried that their way of life is under threat from China. Shortly after the diplomatic switch, the premier of Central Province Stanley Maniteva signed an agreement with a Chinese company called SAM Group, to lease the provincial capital of Tulagi and \u201csurrounding islands\u201d, without specifying which ones were in China\u2019s sights. Local business owner Bernard Kamekaza is worried that \u201csurrounding islands\u201d could mean Savo. While it made international headlines, the lease agreement was dead on arrival. It failed to consider the existing rights of traditional land owners, and was struck down by Solomon Islands\u2019 attorney general John Muria Junior. But there is a deep anxiety that this is not the end of the matter and in early December Kamekaza made the 90-minute banana boat journey from Savo to Tulagi later this month, and delivered a petition alongside other prominent Central Province landholders to Premier Maniteva, demanding an explanation for his handling the lease attempt. Multiple interview requests by the Guardian to Prime Minister Sogavare\u2019s office were denied. Since the switch, the prime minister has rarely commented on it in public. During a week-long visit to Australia in November, Sogavare did not make himself available to Australian media. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad state of affairs for a democratic country like the Solomons [for the leader] to not be able to front up to a decision,\u201d says deputy opposition leader Peter Kenilorea Junior. \u201cJust to say nothing at all is a concern.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
