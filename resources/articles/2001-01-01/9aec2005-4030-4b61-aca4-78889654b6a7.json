Thanks to our lord chancellor, Lord Derry Irvine, we have a situation in which the laws of the land apply - unless you happen to be a very important person hiring an equally notable individual for a highly esteemed appointment. In which case, you don't have to give a toss. It's laissez-faire for the lads. The old boys network is given a status all of its own. In early 1998, Derry Irvine appointed his friend, Gary Hart, as his special adviser on a salary of \u00a373,000. Jane Coker, a respected solicitor with experience in areas useful for a special adviser, objected, as did Martha Osamor, a legal adviser. Coker is white, Osamor black. They took the lord chancellor to an employment tribunal on the grounds that by not advertising the post, he had practised sexual and racial discrimination. Coker won her case. Lord Irvine then successfully appealed. Yesterday, the two women were given the right to appeal against that judgment. Four out of six tribunal members have now decided that our leading legal figure has broken the law. Should he remain victorious then a remarkable precedent will be established. If a job is considered important enough - say head of Railtrack - legislation will be ignored, accountability overlooked and a large pool of talent will be automatically excluded. Why? Because in New Labour's new Britain, what matters is the right of powerful people to pick whom they please from their own (usually) white, male, middle-aged circle of mates. Plus \u00e7a change. \"If you want the best person,\" says Coker, \"you recruit in a non-discriminatory fashion. Otherwise how will anyone know if public money is being spent on the right person for the job?\" There is a pattern of discrimination in the lord chancellor's office. Three years ago, Philip Sales, another friend, was appointed to give legal advice across Whitehall after \"secret\" soundings were taken. Last year too, it was revealed that barristers from the lord chancellor's former chambers had earned more than a million pounds since the election from government work. Lord Irvine's management methods are discriminatory, elitist, an abuse of power. They also provide another less obvious but equally wretched indicator that New Labour's attempts to modernise Britain are doomed - unless there is a radical overhaul of the \"new\" establishment's abysmal quality of leadership. In April, under the Access to Justice Act, the Criminal Defence Service comes into force, part of the shake-up of the legal aid system. Barristers may lose their independent status and become salaried defenders in legal aid cases. Irrespective of the wisdom or otherwise of this change, the way in which Lord Irvine has gone about this reform hardly makes him Boss of the Year material. His critics are quoted as saying that he is \"arrogant... \"impatient and intolerant... he's known as a bully... it's his method....\" Beverly Alimo-Metcalfe is professor of leadership studies at Leeds University. She and three colleagues have just completed a study in the public sector called Leadership Development in British Companies at the Beginning of the 21st Century. What they have concluded is that we lack modern leadership on a depressingly large scale. But what we do appear to have is the Irvine model in bucket loads. This is the transactional, command and control form of autocracy - solving problems without consultation, issuing orders, feeding off status, brooking no criticism, avoiding transparency. The study of what characterises leadership began in the US in the 1930s in the military. Leaders are defined as individuals who have an \"extraordinary positive effect on the motivation, job satisfaction and performance of staff\". In the 1980s, transformational leadership was identified as having a much greater impact than the transactional style. More importantly, it generated bigger profits. Transformational leadership requires charisma, concern for other's well being, delegation, integrity, transparency, approachability and an encouragement of critical thinking. The transformational leader seeks advice, works in collaboration, rules by praise not intimidation and shuns nepotism, self-serving agendas and status. In their study of 36 companies, Alimo-Metcalfe and her colleagues, found that none had highly developed leadership skills at all levels; only 43% believed they had them at some levels while 11% admitted to having inadequate skills at all levels. \"Organisations are interested in making change because they realise that without it, they won't survive,\" Alimo- Metcalfe explains. \"Leaders aren't born, they are made.\" Billions of dollars are now invested in acquiring transformational leadership skills in the US. These skills are also considered closer to a female style of management. \"Female\" not for any biological reasons - women certainly aren't naturally nicer - but because these are the best techniques for outsiders trying to come up from under. Our lord chancellor has appointed a commissioner to help with appointments but old habits die hard. He is a law-breaker, stuck in the past, renowned for his self-glorification and cronyism, happy to exclude, in talented women, the very individuals who have the ability to save his office from himself. And they call this the new Britain? yroberts@dial.pipex.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
