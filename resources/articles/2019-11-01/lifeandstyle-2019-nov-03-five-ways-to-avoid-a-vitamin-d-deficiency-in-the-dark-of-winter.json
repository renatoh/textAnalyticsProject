Levels drop significantly once summer ends. \u201cIt\u2019s not having high levels of vitamin D that matters \u2013 it\u2019s avoiding being deficient,\u201d says Julia Newton-Bishop, professor of dermatology at the University of Leeds. The scientific advisory committee on nutrition recommends that everyone living in the UK should consider taking a moderate daily dose of vitamin D, which helps to keep your bones, teeth and muscles healthy. For people of relative good health, that is 10 micrograms. \u201cFor people with darker skin pigmentation, it\u2019s generally harder to make the same amount of vitamin D from sunlight, so taking a daily supplement year-round should be considered,\u201d says Martin Hewison, professor of molecular endocrinology at the University of Birmingham. \u201cYou can either take a dedicated vitamin D supplement, or a multivitamin capsule, which will usually have a low level close to what the government advises. Eating certain foods can also partially address vitamin D deficiency \u2013 but it\u2019s not enough on its own.\u201d Mushrooms \u201cThe skin of mushrooms has the ability to make vitamin D when sunlight hits it, just like human and animal skin,\u201d says Hewison. \u201cLeaving mushrooms outside where they are exposed to sunlight (if they are inside, window glass will block UVB rays that are used to make vitamin D) means they become vitamin D-enriched. Some mushrooms can now also be bought enriched.\u201d Oily fish Few foods are naturally rich in vitamin D and the levels provided can be hit and miss. \u201cFatty fish such as mackerel, herring and salmon is the best option in moderate portions each week,\u201d says Newton-Bishop. \u201cSalmon in the wild get vitamin D from the plankton they eat, so wild Atlantic salmon, for example, will be rich in it, whereas farmed salmon may not have very much at all. Of course the other problem with fish is that it doesn\u2019t appeal to vegetarians and vegans. In that case, the only natural source is mushrooms.\u201d Fortified foods Fewer foods are enriched with vitamin D in the UK than in, say, the US, says Newton-Bishop. \u201cSo you have to rely more on naturally rich foods. However, some breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin D, and it is also added to some yoghurts.\u201d Researchers from the University of Birmingham found that a national policy of fortifying certain foods such as wheat flour could sufficiently address vitamin D deficiency. Cod liver oil \u201cAlong with the other benefits of omega and fatty acids, one tablespoon of cod liver oil provides far more than the government\u2019s recommended daily intake, so that\u2019s another alternative to taking a dedicated supplement,\u201d says Hewison."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
