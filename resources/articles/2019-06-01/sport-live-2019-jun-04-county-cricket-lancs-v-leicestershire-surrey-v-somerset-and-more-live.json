There, nearly a full day was possible and Durham finished happier, with Derbyshire still 112 runs behind. After an opening stand of 83 between Luis Reece and Billy Godleman, Derbyshire lost wickets regularly as first Ben Raine and then, in a flash of inspiration, Gareth Harte took aim. Godleman made 66 before becoming the first of Harte\u2019s victims in a spell of three for 10. An unbroken seventh-wicket stand of 53 between Matt Critchley and Leus du Plooy added late grit to Derby\u2019s batting. At Aigburth, no play was possible after lunch on a good day for wading birds. The morning session was dominated by Lancashire\u2019s vigorous lower-order against Leicestershire. Tom Bailey hit a powerful 57, going to his fifty with a six that rose over the sight screen and on to the grass tennis courts beyond. When he departed that left Josh Bohannon. But as well as he worked the singles and, as his partners ran low, hit out, he was stranded on 98 when Richard Gleeson fenced and was caught on the stroke of lunch. Bohannon, two short of what would have been a maiden hundred for Lancashire, threw his bat in the air in frustration before pausing for breath and returning to shake his partner\u2019s hand. As the players retired inside for cards, Lancashire could comfort themselves that with their 449 total they had achieved five batting points for the first time in two years \u2013 and as the pitch sweated nicely under layers of plastic sheeting. Play was truncated at Lord\u2019s but not enough for Middlesex, whose top order was picked apart by Sussex\u2019s Ollie Robinson, moving the balls both ways to five slips under obliging skies. He finished with four for 23, including a spell of three for eight in 14 balls. At 61 for four, Middlesex need 282 more to make Sussex bat again, 51 to avoid their worst defeat since the second world war. Glamorgan\u2019s last pair had great fun in the morning session at the County Ground, flashing 95 from 69 balls to take the total well past 500. Michael Hogan crashed two sixes in what was only his third first-class fifty. Rain truncated Northamptonshire\u2019s reply but Ben Curran made a sweet 48 in an unbeaten opening stand. They still trail by 270 runs. At Headingley, Dom Bess too was left stranded in the 90s, nine runs short of what would have been the second first-class century of his career. Bess and Jonny Tattersall added 90 for Yorkshire before Tattersall fell and the tail collapsed. Essex faced six overs before the rain, time enough for Alastair Cook to edge Ben Coad to slip for two. Warwickshire pottered to 311 for seven against Nottinghamshire at Edgbaston, with Adam Hose 84 not out; and at Guildford Surrey struggled against the Overton twins, who grabbed two wickets each. Surrey, 188 for five, trail Somerset by 156. And thus ends the wettest day of the season so far. Every match touched by rain, except Chester-le-Street, where Durham still hold the ascendancy. Still lots to play for - though neither Leicester, nor Middlesex, nor Northants will sleep easy tonight. It\u2019s tricksy at Guildford - will the Overtons roll over Surrey in the morning? Join me here to find out. Thanks for sticking with it through the dank, damp day. I\u2019m off to somewhere warm. Sleep well! Division One Somerset 344 v Surrey 188-5 Surrey trail by 156 with 5 wickets remaining Warwickshire 311-7 v Nottinghamshire Yorkshire 390 v Essex 18-1 Essex trail by 372 with 9 wickets standing Division Two Durham 293 v Derbyshire 181-6 Lancashire 449 v Leicestershire Middlesex 138 &amp; 61-4 v Sussex 481-9 dec (after day three) Middlesex need another 282 to avoid innings defeat Northamptonshire 209 &amp; 68-0 v Glamorgan 547 (after day three) Northants need another 270 to avoid innings defeat Play also abandoned at Edgbaston and Lord\u2019s. Play will restart at 5.30 at Guildford, weather permitting. Play called off for the day at Headingley. A pied wagtail heads towards the tent, tiny claws sinking into the Aigburth sponge. Don\u2019t be too upset but the round-up calls. Rain seems set in everywhere except Chester-le-Street, where Durham have the sniff of a first-innings lead. DIVISION ONE HEADINGLEY: Rain. Yorkshire 390 (Lyth 95, Kohler-Cadmore 83, Bess 91 not out) v Essex 18-1. EDGBASTON: Bad light stopped play. Warwickshire 311-7 (Sibley 87, Hose 84 not out) GUILDFORD: Rain, inspection at 445. Somerset 344 v Surrey 123-4 (Foakes 57) DIVISION TWO AIGBURTH: no more play today. Lancashire 449 (Livingstone 114, Bohannon 98 not out) v Leicestershire CHESTER-LE-STREET: Tea. Durham 293 (Lees 63, Burnham 67; Rampaul 5-77)v Derbyshire 147-6 (Harte 3-10) THE COUNTY GROUND: Rain. Day 3: Northamptonshire 209 (Rossington 77) and 68-0 (Curran 48) v Glamorgan 547 (Billy Root 229) LORD\u2019S: Rain. Day 3: Middlesex 138 &amp; 61-4 (Robinson 4-23) v Sussex 481-9 dec Just as the tent begins to leak, play has been called off at Aigburth. Play will resume in the World Cup match at Cardiff in ten minutes. The match will be 41 overs per side, with a 10-minute break between innings. Barry Harte points out that I forgot, \u201c table topping Hampshire!\u201d Good spot! In fact I meant Hampshire and their formidable attack, instead of Essex. (Sorry Porter and Siddle).My heart is still with Somerset though. Now, as the rain sets in everywhere except the north east, is their moment of glory - Durham have the ascendancy. The mighty Rushworth, the meddlesome Harte (3-10), the reliable Raine, have Derby 133 for six, still 160 behind. Derby 128 for four. Why isn\u2019t it raining in Durham? What larks! So, as we\u2019re here for a while - who is going to win the Championship? Somerset with their jolly band of men, Tres, Leach, Bartlett? Essex and their formidable attack? A weakened Surrey? The Yorkies? Mullaney gets a couple and Warwickshire reach 311 for seven before the rain falls again. Only Durham v Derby ploughs on. Derby 109-2, trail Durham by 184. Godleman 60 not out. Did anyone see Sky\u2019s late night analysis-chat thing with Bob Willis last night? Tymal Mills was on and I thought he was bloody great. Intelligent, modest, knowledgeable. His back problems and subsequent diagnosis had somehow completely passed me by when I had my fingers in other pies. For others like me, this is from cricinfo: \u201chis career reached a watershed in 2015 when he was diagnosed with a congenital back condition: his spinal cord and vertebrae are unusually close together and bowling fast too often can agitate his spinal cord. It threatens to consign him to a future as a white-ball bowler, and he has to tailor his training carefully even to cope with that but with Twenty20 growing in importance neither Mills nor Sussex - nor even England - have abandoned hope that he can make an impact.\u201d Who wants to relive Brian Lara\u2019s 501? Go on then, as you\u2019ve all been so good. A second for Raine as Madsen falls for a duck. Derby 83 for 2. As Warwickshire bat on, and on, and on. 292 for five off 125 overs. So, we have two games currently being played - at Lord\u2019s and Chester-le-Street. Ooooh! Derby lose a wicket - Reece for 34, off, aptly, Raine. Derby 83/1. Smashing picture from Lord\u2019s - five slips for Ollie Robinson. Rain crosses the Pennines, stares at Headingley, and decides to stay awhile. Play suspended, Essex 18 for one. Bad light has stopped play at Guildford too, Surrey 123/4. And it is raining at Cardiff, where Sri Lanka are 182 for 8 off 33 overs. Derby batting soundly after lunch at Chester-le-Street, 72/0. Middlesex, ahem. 51-4. Ollie Robinson 4-18. Ben Foakes falls at Guildford, just after passing fifty. Surrey 119/4. Joverton 2-16, and I\u2019ve just clocked that he has been recalled from his loan spell at Northants which was supposed to last till June 13. Injuries forced Somerset\u2019s hand. Alastair Cook gone! Coaded in the third over of Essex\u2019s reply. Essex 3/1. Sorry we\u2019ve had a few technical issues. All fine now - I hope. The rain is pretty set in here at Liverpool, no play also at Birmingham and Northants. But elsewhere, we play on... The rain turns steady. Groundstaff pull the sheets on to the middle, one, two, three, four, five, unfolding like never-ending plastic duvets. Round the ground brown tip up plastic seats sit damp and empty while drizzle plops into unfinished pints of beer with a sigh. Men in late middle age zip up and settle in for a stoical hour sitting in the rain. Why? We\u2019ve no chance now: DIVISION ONE Somerset 344 v Surrey 101-3 (Foakes 49) Warwickshire 291-5 (Sibley 87, Hose 77 not out) v Nottinghamshire Yorkshire 390 (Lyth 95, Kohler-Cadmore 83, Bess 91 not out) v Essex Division Two Durham 293 (Lees 63, Burnham 67; Rampaul 5-77)v Derbyshire 54-0 Lancashire 449 (Livingstone 114, Bohannon 98 not out) v Leicestershire Day 3: Middlesex 138 &amp; 24-1 v Sussex 481-9 dec Day 3: Northamptonshire 209 (Rossington 77) and 68-0 (Curran 48) v Glamorgan 547 (Billy Root 229) Lunchtime scores to follow. And sweet god, Gleeson flails at Klein and is caught behind. Bohannon whirls his bat in the air, and walks off , before thinking better of it and walking back to his partner and shaking hands. Not out 98 - and that, my friends, is the way it goes. Lancashire 449 all out; Klein 3-89. When you\u2019re, say, in the south of France, fall asleep with your sunglasses on, wake up and wonder why everything is so gloomy? That\u2019s what it is like at Aigburth right now - except with no big reveal when you lift the specs to be dazzled by the sky. Bohannan has it in for Parkinson. Four. Six over his head. 98 not out - a waft of declaration passes in front of the tent. Sri Lanka and Afghanistan slow-cooking up a storm at Cardiff. Sri Lanka 175 for six off 29 overs, K Perera 75 not out. Nabi\u2019s 4-28 from eight has turned it from flat to curious to intriguing. They\u2019ve taken an early lunch at Lord\u2019s - Middlesex 24 for one, trail by 319. Northants 35 without loss in the wake of Glamorgan\u2019s ridiculousness. Fingers crossed for wee Ben Curran. Derby\u2019s openers make a smart start - 47/0. Bess loses Tattersall, but plugs away. Now 75 not out, can he be the yorkshireman (of sorts) who makes the magic three figures? Yorks 371 for seven. At Warwickshire, the sloth has escaped. Adam Hose has fifty, and Warwicks do a one-handed chin up with an unbuttoned shirt - 253 for five you say? Foakes and Borthwick rebuilding at Guildford - 39 runs to rescue Surrey from 38/3. England women\u2019s squad to face West Indies on Thursday - Sarah Taylor returns from injury. England squad: Heather Knight (Berkshire, captain), Tammy Beaumont (Kent), Katherine Brunt (Yorkshire), Kate Cross (Lancashire), Sophie Ecclestone (Lancashire), Alex Hartley (Lancashire), Jenny Gunn (Nottinghamshire), Amy Jones (Warwickshire), Laura Marsh (Kent), Nat Sciver (Surrey), Anya Shrubsole (Berkshire), Sarah Taylor (Sussex, wicketkeeper), Fran Wilson (Kent), Lauren Winfield (Yorkshire), Danni Wyatt (Sussex). And a thunder-footed Graham Onions is out for two. Lancs 418 for nine. Bailey, who must have been under instruction to get on with it, cuts once too many times, and is caught by Wright off Dexter for 57. With the unreliable forecast, Lancs presumably relying on not having to bat again. Josh Bohannon 77 not out though... Lancs 415 for eight. It\u2019s overcast and Leicestershire\u2019s openers are feeling twitchy. And in World Cup news, South Africa\u2019s Dale Steyn is out because of his shoulder injury, to be replaced by Beuran Hendricks. Wow and big Tom Bailey steps, heaves and lofts hugely - six! - up and over the sightscreen at the Mersey end, and on to the grass tennis courts beyond. That\u2019s his fifty and Lancashire galloping away here, 410 for seven. News on Joe Burns, Lancashire\u2019s overseas player who had to return back home to Australia early. He has been diagnosed with a protracted post-virus fatigue disorder dating back to an October 2018 viral infection and is recovering with rest and recuperation. He hopes to play cricket again in the near future. Fifty for Dom Bess! Who wouldn\u2019t be happy for him? Fortune can be a bastard as well as a fickle friend, but he\u2019s got the character to (literally) bounce back. Yorkshire 325 for six. They\u2019re off for bad light at Lord\u2019s with Middlesex 24 for 1 (Holden out for five). And the ball has gone out of shape at Headingley. Glamorgan\u2019s No.11 Michael Hogan has fifty! Seven fours and two sixes as his side keep an eye on 450. Surrey 36 for 2, as big hands Trescothick holds on at slip and Rory Burns goes for a Warwickshire-esque 2, off 39 balls. Leicestershire, home of Simon de Montfort, the father of parliaments (and other rather less savoury things), has elected a female chairperson to work alongside a female CEO. The first female double-act in county cricket. And, with a smart straight drive, Josh Bohannon has fifty! Lancashire 371 for seven. Dom Sibley falls for 87, adding just six more runs to his overnight score. Would it be wrong to hope, for the benefit of any spectators, that his replacement gets his skates on? Warwickshire 202 for four. Er, just what is happening to Glamorgan? Timm van der Gugten and Paul Hogan knock up fifty in less than six overs and Glamorgan waltz past 500 towards...six? At Guildford, Stoneman has gone for 21, a wicket for birthday boy Jack Brooks. It\u2019s raining, again. But the men in white play through. A hardy band of supporters round the boundary put up their brollies and fold their papers small and smaller again. Abhijato Sensarma has been thinking about Durham. \u201cAt the moment I start to type out this email, EJH Eckersley is 6* off 55 deliveries in a classical attempt at making useful first-inning slower order runs. His partner-in-crime, MJ Potts is 3* (25) too. As they try to survive out in the middle as long as possible for Durham in the Second Division, I do have to send some love their way. \u201cAfter all, seeing people who aren\u2019t meant to do much with the willow deadbat their way to underrated glory is surprisingly refreshing in a mad era where England scores above 300 in an ODI and still loses!\u201d Hmmm, Eoin Morgan escapes censure for a slow over rate, but Archer and Roy aren\u2019t so lucky. Mohammad Abbas has the ball and we get underway here at a cloudy Aigburgh! Play all round the country - life is good. Mark Stoneman starting like Marcus Trescothick did yesterday - with a six! Surrey 18/0. Paul Horton being greeted happily by lots of Lancashire fans, he was captain of Sefton Park for many years, and played for them this weekend. And, I should have said, a very jolly Eid Mubarak to all readers celebrating today! It has stopped raining at Headingley, play will strike up, but you\u2019ve time for a coffee. And the pitter patter restarts on the canvas roof. Arrived at Aigburth station, to find a sun and the birds tweeting (is there a more technical term?) in the Triffid-sized horse-chestnuts frowning over the rose-filled front gardens. The teams are warming up on the outfield, Leicester disconcertingly all in black, and after an inspection, play will start at a civilised 11.15. Vic\u2019s report from yesterday: Division One Somerset 344 v Surrey 0-0 Warwickshire 181-3 v Nottinghamshire Yorkshire 289-6 v Essex Division Two Durham 254-8 v Derbyshire Lancashire 347-7 v Leicestershire Middlesex 138 &amp; 9-0 v Sussex 481-9 dec (after day two) Middlesex trail by 334 with 10 wickets remaining Northamptonshire 209 v Glamorgan 452-9 (after day two) Glamorgan lead by 243 with one wicket remaining Good morning! A confession: it is wet and ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chilly so I\u2019m writing this in the relative warmth of Liverpool Lime Street before dragging anorak et al to the canvas confines of the Aigburth tent. The forecast round the grounds today is fair-to-miserable, so expect stop-start-stop with a sprinkling of stardust. Lots of intriguing cricket to keep an eye on - can Somerset\u2019s bowlers stick it to Surrey at Guildford (where Jack Leach was concussed by Morne Morkel last year)? Can Warwickshire\u2019s batsmen move into first gear? Yorkshire v Essex is in the balance, as is Durham v Derby. I think Lancs are on top at Aigburth, while Middlesex and Northants can expect to pack their bags tonight with a sad face and a lesson learnt. If you\u2019re still tingling from Pakistan\u2019s take-that-and-party yesterday, don\u2019t forget to keep an eye on Afghanistan v Sri Lanka at Cardiff, OBO here with your two crackers Tom Davies and Rob Smyth. And finally, how can it be 26 years since this?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
