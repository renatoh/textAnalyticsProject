The word peshmerga derives from the Persian pesh, meaning 'to stand in front of', and merga, meaning 'death' - so it means 'those who face death'. The two main peshmerga militias are each loyal to one of the two Kurdish liberation parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). As the US does not support its allies' goal of a free Kurdistan, US Special Forces are also seeking to keep the guerrillas' ambitions in check. Can they avoid becoming entangled in a Kurdish-Turkish stand-off in the North? Lexicon: Tip-fiddle Donald Rumsfeld's greatest crime may be fiddling with the 'tip-fiddle', according to Pentagon generals who were grumbling last week about the US Defence Secretary's habit of getting too involved in military matters. The Time-Phased Forces Deployment List (TPFDL) sets out in the minutest detail everything from troop deployments to the supply of food and toilet rolls. Rumsfeld's tinkering with the war blueprint has not gone down well. 'When you kill the tip-fiddle, you kill centralised military planning,' a former intelligence officer said. How long will we stay? Tony Blair's pledge to the Iraqi people says the coalition will 'not stay a moment longer than necessary'. Iraq 'should be run by the Iraqis' he told the Commons last week. But how long will the 'Iraqification' of a post-Saddam government take? Coalition military commanders will need to establish order on 'the day after'. But what sort of civilian administration will take over is the subject of heated diplomatic debate. US reluctance to allow a significant UN role beyond humanitarian relief has led to charges of imposing an 'American fiefdom' led by retired Pentagon general Jay Garner. But another common criticism, most recently voiced over Afghanistan, has been that the Americans have been too keen to leave before enough 'nation-building' has been done. Iraq has a well-developed bureaucracy and one easy option may be to remove only a few leaders. The Iraqi National Congress fears that the 'de-Baathification' of the Iraqi government may not run very deep. Meanwhile the US and British military role will depend on how the war ends - and whether there is significant guerrilla resistance. British troops expected to stay in Northern Ireland only for weeks or months in 1969. Having an exit strategy is not the same as getting out. Fog of war 'It's no fun being called Saddam Hussein these days', said Saddam Hussein, a 20-year-old Kurdish refugee now living in Norway. 'When my father chose the name, we didn't know what we now know about Saddam,' he told newspaper Aftenposten. He is changing his name to Dastanse Rasol Hussein after receiving obscene calls. Poll count \u00b7 George Bush's approval rating at home (71 per cent) is much higher than Tony Blair's in Britain. \u00b7 In France, 25 per cent want Iraq to win the war, 34 per cent support the US and Britain, while 31 per cent back neither side. Fifty-four per cent believe the allied coalition will win ( Le Monde /TF1). At a glance Sunday US helicopter crash in southern Iraq kills three soldiers.
