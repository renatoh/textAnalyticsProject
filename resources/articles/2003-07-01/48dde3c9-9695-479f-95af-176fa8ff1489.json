The enormous enthusiasm for these online discussions has led us to create The Observer Book Club, which aims to offer our readers discounts on high-quality fiction and non-fiction titles together with the benefits of belonging to a book group. On the last Sunday of every month, we will introduce one newly published book and one neglected modern classic, which you can order from the number below. You can then participate in online discussions, while every week on the website and in the books pages, we will offer updated commentary on the books from Observer writers and summarise the responses, along with interactive elements such as quizzes and links to other sites. This month, we've chosen Monica Ali's Brick Lane (Doubleday) and Keep The Aspidistra Flying by George Orwell (Penguin). Ali's is the most acclaimed debut novel of the year, and saw its author voted on to the Granta list of 20 Best Young British Novelists long before the book was published last month. Critics have raved about her rich, witty portrait of two women struggling with love, marriage, religion, family and Britishness in east London's Bangladeshi community. Comedian Shazia Mirza called Brick Lane 'moving and honest', but some Muslim women feel misrepresented by the book. Does fiction have a duty to provide a faithful representation of its society, or do we only demand this when the subject is a minority culture? In his centenary year, plenty of attention has been given to Orwell's Animal Farm and 1984. But we've chosen to re-read his third novel, Keep The Aspidistra Flying. This dark comedy follows the misfortunes of a man who gives up his job as a copywriter in protest at the modern obsession with money and dedicates himself to poetry - with no success. Orwell disdained his earlier novels. Was he right to do so, or does Aspidistra hint at the frightening satire to come? Is it still a good story?
