It can reveal personality, be emotional or detached, and it can evoke a sense of drama or stillness. As a photographer, you can decide whether to treat your subject objectively or to create your own narrative. The decisions that you make will have an effect on the mood and style of your portrait. You'll find that with a little thought, even an unpromising subject can be transformed into an interesting image. Changing pace In my work I take photographs of politicians, artists, celebrities and business people. With the bulk of these subjects, the time I have to take a shot is extremely limited, and there can be many constraints that are out of my control. I had just 30 minutes to capture this image of Tony Blair (main image): 20 minutes to set up and 10 minutes for the actual shoot. Although I thrive under this pressure, what I find even more exhilarating is photographing \"ordinary\" people at my own pace. My portrait of Shopna (left) was taken early one morning after I had spent a whole year documenting the life of this young girl from east London. Such an intimate image wouldn't have been possible in 10 minutes. Choose your subject If you are just starting out it might be helpful to photograph someone you know, such as a family member, friend or flatmate, to help you build your confidence. Once you're ready for more of a challenge, choose someone you find interesting. It could be a person you see in your neighbourhood, a shopkeeper, for example. To find subjects, I often stop people on the street and ask if I can photograph them. I once photographed a series of dog owners for the London Underground. I only had a couple of months to complete the project, so I was constantly on the lookout for potential subjects. While I was out driving I saw a young man walking his puppy. He was happy to be part of the project, so we set a date there and then to photograph him and his family at home (left). Try not to be nervous of approaching strangers. The worst they can do is say no, and it does get easier with practice. Just don't be too forceful. Some people aren't comfortable in front of the camera, and you have to respect that. Confidence and control The main thing you should do before a shoot is make sure you're confident with your equipment and that it works. Scouting your location in advance will also help you feel prepared. If you start to feel nervous on the day, don't rush \u2013 just take a step back for a moment. The person you are taking photos of needs to feel comfortable and trust you, so you need to be calm and in control. It helps to be a good communicator. Listen, be patient and try to empathise with your subject. It's important that you pay as much attention to this as you do to the technical aspect of the work. If your subject seems nervous, try talking with them while you shoot, as this can help distract them from the camera. Don't be brash and bossy \u2013 just ask them a few questions about themselves and see if this relaxes them. If they don't like talking, stop. Allow some space for the subject to explore their own posture and expressions. However, some people will need directions on where to look or what to do with their hands. If it just isn't working, move on and try a different location. Be ready for the moment when your subject drops their guard \u2013 the best shots will capture a moment that shows them as they really are. Otherwise, the subject looking straight at the camera with the focus on the eyes can produce powerful results, especially with a shallow depth of field. Looking away from the camera creates a different mood. Really, there are no rules. You just have to go with the feel and flow at the time. Remember, it's all about capturing the subject and about how they respond to you. Decide where to shoot I tend to shoot in a lot of hotel rooms, so I often need to improvise with the setting. I often bring in my own colour paper backdrops, as a plain background can work better than a very cluttered environment, or change the overall mood. For my image of Beth Ditto (left), for example, I used a pink backdrop because I knew it would work well with her style. Curtains can make an interesting variation as a backdrop, as seen in this portrait of Trevor McDonald (below). Shooting people in their own environment can make your image more personal, but don't just settle for the first room that you walk into \u2013 it's always good to have a wander around and explore various options. You might want to include the pictures on the wall or the furniture. Just remember to pay attention to the ambient light in the room. Tools of the trade I regularly use my mobile phone camera to make visual notes, but if I'm looking for quality images I tend to use a medium format camera. It is a bit slower and heavier than a digital SLR (and needs a tripod), but it creates richer pictures. I find its size also creates a useful presence on a shoot. A digital SLR with a standard 50mm lens can achieve a looser feel, as it's less conspicuous. Use a 35mm lens if you want to show the surroundings more, or 85mm to get a little bit tighter on the face. Lighting your subject The standard rules of portraiture say that there should be a \"key\" (brighter) light to one side of your subject and \"fill in\" light on the other. In practice, the subject and location will dictate the setup. If you are indoors try asking your subject to face towards the window. Soft natural light will create subtle shadows that compliment skin tones, as seen in the portrait of model Grace (left), shot for a teenage beauty book. If necessary, you could also try using a reflector to bounce the light back into the subject's face to soften the shadows even more, or to add some light to the eyes. This image of Linford Christie (left) was shot on a Nikon digital SLR with an 85mm lens. I placed a large white reflector on the floor and worked with natural daylight, using a short depth of field. You don't need to spend lots of money on lighting equipment. You can make your own reflector from a large piece of white card, covering one side with a sheet of foil to give yourself an even brighter option, if necessary. If you have a flashgun and you're shooting indoors, set it up separately \u2013 at, say, 45 degrees from the camera \u2013 and direct it at your subject. This will throw more shadow, creating more drama and making the image appear more three-dimensional. Alternatively, for a softer look, try pointing the flash up at the ceiling or at a white wall to bounce the light back on to your subject. Readers' assignment Choose a subject \u2013 a friend or family member \u2013 and find a location with good natural light. You may want to sit your subject at a chair or table: they will probably feel more comfortable with somewhere to place their hands or lean their body. Keep the conversation flowing to help them relax and then just begin taking your photos. Try a variety of shots, starting with a wide shot showing the surroundings then moving the camera closer to the subject, focusing on just their face.
