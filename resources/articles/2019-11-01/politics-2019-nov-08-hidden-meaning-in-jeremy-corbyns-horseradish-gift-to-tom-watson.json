During and after both world wars, many soldiers and their wives/widows, children/orphans have found solace in Brooke\u2019s stirring words. One could debate the merits of patriotism, but this poem is not \u201csnivelling ethnocentricity\u201d. Mark Thompson Romford, Essex \u2022 Joel Golby says TI\u2019s behaviour in having his daughter\u2019s hymen checked annually \u201cborders on abuse\u201d (G2, 8 November). Under Working Together to Safeguard Children and Young People, every school and college in the land would refer that behaviour for what it is: abuse.

Horseradish is sharp, deep-rooted and impossible to get rid of. What a gift, what a metaphor! Elaine Yeo Enfield, London \u2022 How about adding a bleakness rating to your reviews? Peter Bradshaw gave Sorry We Missed You five stars (Review, 2 November) but it deserved five shovels for the depths of despair it evoked. After I, Daniel Blake, I should have known the latest Loach would be gruelling but it left me without any hope at all. What a world we live in. Wendy Dear Cottenham, Cambridgeshire \u2022 Before politicians talk of gold standards in education (Ofqual orders more lenient marking in GCSE French and German, 6 November) they would do well to remember what the sterling gold standard did to the economy. Roy Boffy Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands \u2022 Further to the fracking moratorium correspondence (Letters, 4 November), I have just re-read an earlier article (Britain to use \u00a31bn green fund to support Argentina fracking, 23 October).
