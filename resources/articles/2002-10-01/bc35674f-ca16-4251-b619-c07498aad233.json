Of all the talents who made their bones during the Hollywood Renaissance, Schrader is the one who seems to have been left behind. Spielberg, Scorsese, Lucas, De Palma, even Coppola (who lost his talent 20 years ago) all are now elder statesmen at Hollywood's top table, while Schrader, who hasn't made a studio picture since the failure of Cat People in 1982, has spent the last two decades scrounging around for independent funding. And yet his unsettling output has been every bit as fascinating as that of his more successful peers. Schrader reminds me a little of Claude Chabrol, who occupied a similar position within the French new wave of the 1960s. While Truffaut and Godard became international celebs, Chabrol - whose films, anti-bourgeois thrillers with a thimbleful of Hitchcock and a bucketful of Lang, seemed the most conventional of the new-wavers - is still making movies that interest him, while Truffaut is almost forgotten, and Godard is kept off US screens by timorous distributors. Just as I would choose Chabrol's Le Boucher as my Desert Island DVD (if it were available) without a backward glance at Truffaut or Godard, so would I sooner settle down for a retrospective of half-successful Schrader movies - Light Sleeper, Blue Collar - than rewatch many classics made by his pals. With Schrader about to film a prequel to The Exorcist, his first studio project since Cat People, now seems a good time to look back at his career, especially because his latest release, Auto Focus, has attracted all kinds of praise. It's another entry in a genre that Schrader can claim to have invented: the unflattering warts'n'all biopic, the filmed anti-hagiography. His first effort was Raging Bull, which apart from being all the things critics acclaim it for, is also fascinating for the ways it turned conventional biopic rules on their head. Jake LaMotta was a thug, not a role model; there are no inspirational messages about endurance, transcendence or triumph in the movie; and the subject himself was very much alive, even though it was the sort of biography other artists would have avoided making until he was safely interred. (Imagine LaMotta turning up at Schrader's door screaming: \"Did you fuck my LIFE?\" He settled for a lawsuit.) In the intervening years, Schrader has returned to the form with Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters, Patty Hearst and, at a pinch, The Last Temptation of Christ, which he scripted. And Auto Focus is another, although UK audiences are probably unfamiliar with the tawdry and miserable story of Bob Crane. Crane was the star of the POW camp sitcom Hogan's Heroes (successful but recently listed as one of the worst TV shows ever by TV Guide), and, in his off-hours, also starred in amateur sex movies that he captured in his voyeur's apartment. Crane was a Reagan Republican when the show kicked off at the end of the 1960s, but fame led him to indulge his fantasies, especially after he'd made friends with weasly John Carpenter (no relation to the director), a video-tech and studio hanger-on. Together, they became swingers-come-lately, persuading all sorts of floozies to strip off and perform for them and their cameras. In 1978 Crane, who'd lost his wife and family because of his obsessions, was found in his Arizona apartment with his skull bashed in. Carpenter was tried and acquitted, but Schrader's version as good as re-indicts him. As these twin lords of dorkness, Greg Kinnear and Willem Dafoe give skin-crawlingly convincing performances. Dafoe is memorably sleazy as Carpenter, and Kinnear is an eye-opener in his sub-Hefnerian sweaters and suburban-horndog slacks, cluelessly pursuing his pervy dreams all the way to his own private apocalypse. The movie starts out squeaky-clean, smooth and brightly lit, shot mainly on Steadicam and from fixed positions in long shots, but as Crane's life gradually spins into chaos, Schrader uses more cuts and more handheld camera to amplify the irreversible deterioration of his characters' souls. Yes, it's grim, but also strangely uplifting and touching. The characters are so empty, pathetic and easy to dislike that these feelings must derive from Schrader's direction, or his own personal stake in the subject-matter (he has admitted \"using a lot of pornography\" in his past). His biopics seem to play off aspects of himself or his obsessions. Mishima is his meditation on art and suicide (Paul and his brother Leonard both shared a fascination with guns and self-immolation in the 1970s), as well as an attempt to address Japanese cinema, an enormous influence, head-on. Patty Hearst, with its almost abstract captivity sequences, is his Carl-Theodor Dreyer movie, spare and weirdly devout. Schrader has also written unfilmed scripts for biopics of Hank Williams, the tragic, semi-literate drunk who wrote some of America's most enduring songs, and of singer Bobby Darin, raised by a mother he thought was his sister (like Jack Nicholson), who lived his whole short, enviably talented life knowing he would die young from a congenital heart disorder. Schrader's enthusiasm for life stories isn't unique any more; the job of churning out offbeat biopics, often of nutters and three-bedroom assholes, was taken up by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski (who wrote Ed Wood, The People Vs Larry Flynt and Man in the Moon) and made the form much more irreverent, and its subject matter that much weirder. It's only appropriate that the wheel has now come full-circle: working in a genre that Schrader transformed, they have repaid his inspiration by giving a final polish to Michael Gerbosi's script for Auto Focus. If only the studios would give Schrader backing for one of his own projects rather than The Exorcist prequel. Ten-to-one he'd throw the money back in their faces in the form of a squirmingly uncomfortable semi-masterpiece (the Hank movie?), and they'd throw him out into the cold again. In the absence of such a movie, I urge anyone unfamiliar with Schrader's work to go back and see all his movies. The Gay Godfather At Christmas in 1995 there was a samizdat video doing the rounds featuring the crudely animated story of a showdown between Santa and Jesus. It featured little tykes who said things like: \"Hey, dude, don't say 'pig-fucker' in front of Jesus!\" Within a year its makers, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, had a deal with Comedy Central for South Park, and the rest is history. Another tape is now doing the rounds, a 12-minute spoof derived from former CAA over-dog Mike Ovitz's Vanity Fair interview in July, in which he referred bitterly to Hollywood's \"gay mafia\" which, he said, had plotted his downfall. Two film-makers, Steve Young and Denise David, thought Ovitz's galloping paranoia would form the basis for an amusing skit. The result is the clumsily titled My Dinner With Whacking the Big Guy Ovitz, Young and David's lavender version of The Godfather. We're treated to Disney chief Michael Eisner waking up screaming with Mickey Mouse's severed head in his bed, and scenes in which David Geffen, Barry Diller and Ron Meyer plot Ovitz's assassination (\"I don't want David coming out of that bathroom with just his dick in his hand!\"). Instead of pizzerias on Mulberry Avenue, My Dinner takes place in all of west Hollywood's swishiest gay pick-up joints and bars, with the moguls all looking like horny teenagers. It's filled with half-recognisable satiric dialogue. Diller: \"This guy's gotta be stopped!\" Meyer: \"Barry, no one's ever whacked a super-agent.\" Diller: \"Maybe it's about time.\" Eisner: \"What do you think this is? The music business? Where you can just have a drive-by?\" And so on for 12 hugely enjoyable minutes. Young and David claim this isn't a South Park-style attempt at profile-raising, just a joke for friends. Either way, they were stunned, then pleasantly surprised, when Ron Meyer called them up and said: \"Me and Geffen were pissing in our pants watching it!\" So far, Mike Ovitz hasn't called."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
