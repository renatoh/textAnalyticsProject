Shortly after initial results pointing to a landslide win for the opposition coalition candidate, Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu, emerged on Sunday evening, the candidate of the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP), Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, conceded and congratulated his rival. The repeat election, designed to undo \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s narrow surprise win in the 31 March contest, was an unprecedented test for both Turkey\u2019s fragile democratic institutions and Erdo\u011fan\u2019s political future. Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m\u2019s swift concession saved the AKP the embarrassment of watching the vote count add up to a second defeat, but the loss is likely to lead to intense new power struggles inside the coalition government. Opposition parties were jubilant. \u201cWe are starting a new page in Istanbul. On this new page, there will be justice, equality, love. Today 16 million Istanbullus have refreshed our belief in democracy,\u201d \u0130mamo\u011flu told supporters in a televised speech. \u201cI thank them all from my heart. You have shown the world that Turkey still protects its democracy. And we have shown other countries who try to go down the road we were choosing that it is no road at all.\u201d The president issued his congratulations to \u0130mamo\u011flu on Twitter after initial results showed that with 99% of ballots counted the People\u2019s Republican party (CHP) candidate had increased his lead in March, of 13,000 votes, to an astonishing 777,000, or 54%. Crowded parties broke out on Istanbul\u2019s main shopping streets and in liberal neighbourhoods. \u201cThis has brought people hope,\u201d said Semra Deniz, 35, from the city\u2019s artistic hub, Cihangir. \u201cI came to this neighbourhood six years ago and a lot has changed. Places closed down. I hope the cultural erosion is reversed and people feel free to express themselves again.\u201d Despite blanket pro-government media coverage, \u0130mamo\u011flu, a previously anonymous local administrator, stunned the country with his narrow win in March. For Erdo\u011fan, the loss of his hometown, where his political career began in the 1990s, was a personal blow. After weeks of AKP appeals, Turkey\u2019s electoral board upheld one complaint regarding ballot counting and annulled \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s victory, sparking outrage even within the ruling party\u2019s ranks, where some feared the board had dented the AKP\u2019s democratic credentials. At polling stations on Sunday both CHP and AKP voters stressed that they wanted the repeat election accepted as final. \u201cClearly there is some funny business going on here but I don\u2019t know what,\u201d said AKP voter Cihat I\u00e7yumaz, 65, who like many Istanbullus cut short his summer holiday to vote. \u201cFor me, chaos after this round of elections is the scariest outcome. I just want the candidate who is best for Istanbul to win.\u201d Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m worked hard in the second round of campaigning to close the gap with his rival, reaching out to the party\u2019s base in working class and conservative neighbourhoods, voters who punished the government for Turkey\u2019s economic crisis by staying away in March. However, in both a televised debate with \u0130mamo\u011flu and in conversations with voters, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m struggled to explain why the repeat election was necessary. \u0130mamo\u011flu was embraced by voters for a platform which focused on bringing people together across the city\u2019s religious, class and ethnic divides, and was able to paint his new campaign as a battle for the future of Turkish democracy itself. \u201cThe AKP decision to go for a rerun was a colossal strategic mistake,\u201d said Turkish-American political scientist Soner \u00c7a\u011faptay. \u201cAnd the campaign was an uncharacteristic mess. For the first time in a long time, [the AKP] were on the back foot here, running after the opposition, who dominated the narrative. \u201cErdo\u011fan has to do some serious house-cleaning in his government and reassess his policy making process to bounce back from this, or the suggestion that this is the beginning of his decline will get louder.\u201d Rumours are already circulating that the second defeat could trigger a snap national election as Erdo\u011fan seeks to oust increasingly fractious elements in his governing coalition. Losing Istanbul for a second time is an unthinkable outcome for the AKP. Turkey\u2019s biggest city and economic heart, it accounted for 31% of GDP in 2017 and is an important driver of the government\u2019s unofficial patronage networks. It has been controlled by the ruling party and its Islamist predecessors for a quarter of a century. Observers note that \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s mandate is still far from assured: the 2015 general election which saw the AKP lose its majority in parliament was rerun and other charismatic challengers to Erdo\u011fan have been imprisoned or folded under pressure. The AKP still controls 25 of Istanbul\u2019s 39 districts and holds a majority in the municipal assembly, which will make it difficult for \u0130mamo\u011flu to deliver on campaign promises. The margin of his victory, however, shows that at least in Istanbul there is a strong appetite for change after 16 years of national AKP rule. \u201cTurkey has been ruled by a populist leader for almost two decades: he [Erdo\u011fan] has tried to erode the rule of law and take over the media,\u201d \u00c7a\u011faptay said. \u201cPeople say it takes a long time to build a democracy, but today\u2019s result shows it takes a long time to kill a democracy too. Clearly, Turkey\u2019s democratic structures are incredibly resilient.\u201d Additional reporting: G\u00f6k\u00e7e Sara\u00e7o\u011flu"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
