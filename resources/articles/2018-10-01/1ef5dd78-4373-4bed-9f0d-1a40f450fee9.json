But as the 2018 midterm election campaign pulls into its homestretch, Republican attacks in two congressional races happening 3,000 miles apart have triggered alarm bells for targeting non-white candidates in an apparent effort to highlight their \u201cotherness\u201d. The first comes from California\u2019s 50th district, where Ammar Campa-Najjar is running as a Democrat for a seat currently occupied by the Republican Duncan Hunter. NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd, a veteran political reporter and commentator called the spot \u201cmaybe the most shocking and outrageous political ad I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d, in a Meet The Press Daily segment. The ad zeroes in on Campa-Najjar\u2019s heritage \u2013 his mother is Mexican American and his father is Palestinian \u2013 calling him a \u201cPalestinian, Mexican, millennial Democrat\u201d who is \u201cworking to infiltrate Congress\u201d and a \u201csecurity risk\u201d. \u201cAt best it\u2019s desperate. That\u2019s putting it mildly,\u201d said Campa-Najjar, who also called the effort \u201cblatantly ignorant\u201d and \u201cunhinged from reality\u201d. Last Wednesday a bipartisan group of dozens of national security veterans decried the spot as a \u201cracist and bigoted\u201d attack. \u201cThe baseless allegation that he is somehow a \u2018security threat\u2019 is an affront to our professionalism as national security experts, our American values, and our collective national dignity,\u201d the group said in an open letter. The ad accuses Campa-Najjar of being supported by the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood with no evidence, and despite the fact that Campa-Najjar is a Christian. \u201cIt\u2019s just so interesting that we live in a world where Islamophobia even extends to non-Muslims,\u201d Campa-Najjar told the Guardian. The rest of the ad is focused on trying to tie Campa-Najjar to his grandfather, Mohammed Najjar, who was a member of the Black September Organization which plotted the 1972 Munich Olympic massacre that killed 11 Israeli athletes and a German police officer. Campa-Najjar was born 16 years after his grandfather was killed by Israeli forces for his role in the attacks, but Hunter\u2019s advert accused Campa-Najjar of changing his name to \u201chide his family\u2019s ties to terrorism\u201d. The ad also claimed that Campa-Najjar\u2019s father, Yasser Najjar once said the victims of the attack \u201cdeserved to die\u201d, which was reported by right wing news network One America, but for which the original news segment did not provide any attribution. Campa-Najjar said he and his father were now \u201cmostly estranged\u201d, but that the quote was \u201ccompletely diametrically opposed\u201d to what he knows of his father\u2019s worldview, and public comments Yasser Najjar has made. Campa-Najjar did recently change his name from Yassir-Najjar to Campa-Najjar, but has professionally gone by the latter for years, and said the change was to reflect the influence of his mother\u2019s family, which primarily raised him. In a email statement to the Guardian, Hunter\u2019s spokesman, Michael Harrison, declined to provide a source for the claims about the Muslim Brotherhood or the quote from Campa-Najjar\u2019s father, but insisted that \u201cthe facts \u2026 raise national security concerns\u201d. Harrison added: \u201cany suggestion of racism or Islamophobia is completely contrary to the fact that Congressman Hunter has endorsed a Muslim candidate\u201d in a different local race. Campa-Najjar, who worked at the labor department\u2019s office of public affairs under Barack Obama, attributes the ad to desperation in a race that a recent LA times poll suggests may be tightening. While California\u2019s 50th typically leans Republican, Campa-Najjar is buoyed by general wave of Democratic support and by the fact that Hunter was recently indicted on corruption charges, which he denies. \u201cThe fact is, there\u2019s me, who was cleared by the FBI to work at White House, and there\u2019s Hunter who was indicted by the FBI,\u201d said Campa-Najjar. \u201cSo the law\u2019s on my side and not his side as of late.\u201d David Schweidel, a professor of marketing at the Goizueta Business School at Emory University said ads like this may increasingly be more en vogue in the post-2016 election climate largely because Trump\u2019s well-documented reliance on personal attacks proved effective enough to win the White House. \u201cWe saw pundit after pundit kind of commenting on the fact that these personal attacks weren\u2019t coming across as presidential and how \u2018it\u2019s the wrong temperament\u2019. Well, guess what, people responded to it,\u201d Schweidel said. Schweidel was part of a research team that looked at the effects of negative political ads in a 2018 study. They found that negative advertising persists because, \u201cas much as people say they don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s extremely effective\u201d. He added that spots like Hunter\u2019s are generally not intended to sway undecided voters, but to inspire the base to show up at the polls. As US politics continues its long slog towards ever-increased partisanship, elections become more about turning out the base and less about converting undecideds: which could mean negative and personal attacks only become more prevalent. On the other side of the country, attack ads on a black congressional candidate\u2019s former career as a rapper have taken on racist undertones in a district that, like California\u2019s 50th, is predominantly white. Antonio Delgado, a Harvard Law graduate and Rhodes Scholar is running as a Democrat for a seat in New York\u2019s 19th district currently held by Republican John Faso. As a young man, Delgado released a socially conscious and political hip-hop album under the name AD the Voice in 2006. Since the album came to light, a number of Republican groups have seized on it to paint Delgado\u2019s flirtation with hip-hop as out of step with the values of the district. The Congressional Leadership Fund released an advert spot referring to Delgado as a \u201cNew York City liberal\u201d and \u201c[Nancy] Pelosi\u2019s candidate\u201d before clipping a handful of Delgado\u2019s song lyrics, overlaying dramatically loud \u201cbleep\u201d sounds over words like \u201cfuck\u201d, \u201csex\u201d and \u201cporno\u201d. The ad also accused Delgado of \u201clacing his raps with extremist attacks on American values\u201d, playing a clip where Delgado states, factually, that more civilian lives were lost during the Iraq war than the 9/11 attacks. Faso didn\u2019t place the ads, but has not condemned them either, saying in a statement this summer that \u201cMr Delgado\u2019s lyrics paint an ugly and false picture of America.\u201d The subtext of the ads was seemingly illuminated in a New York Times article from July when Gerald Benjamin, a friend of Faso\u2019s and director of the Benjamin Center at State University of New York at New Paltz, posed the question: \u201cIs a guy who makes a rap album the kind of guy who lives here in rural New York and reflects our lifestyle and values?\u201d He continued: \u201cPeople like us, people in rural New York, we are not people who respond to this part of American culture,\u201d eventually sparking protests from students at his home campus in New Paltz. Benjamin later apologized for his remarks. Delgado has said the ads are an effort to \u201cotherize\u201d him in the eyes of the white voters he needs to win. \u201cIt\u2019s insulting to people in the district that Faso believes they will buy into this sort of deception and dishonesty,\u201d said Delgado\u2019s campaign manager, Allyson Marcus, noting that a similarly themed Super Pac radio ad was even pulled by the local radio station WDST, which called the ad \u201chighly offensive\u201d and \u201cfactually distorted\u201d in a statement. \u201cThe truth is Antonio grew up in a working-class family in Schenectady, right here in upstate New York, where he learned the values of hard work and accountability. The real question is, why won\u2019t Faso condemn these divisive and deceptive ads,\u201d Marcus asked. Faso did not respond to a request for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
