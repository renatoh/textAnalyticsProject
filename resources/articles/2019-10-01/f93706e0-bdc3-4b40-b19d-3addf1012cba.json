There was little surprise at the news that Towcester\u2019s final 10 fixtures had been sold off \u2013 no white knight having emerged to save the business since it went into administration more than a year ago \u2013 but there was much dismay. The Northamptonshire track was well known for its stiff, uphill finish and its stamina-sapping surface, which produced some of the most thrilling and prolonged finishes in jump racing. The Gold Cup and Grand National-winning trainer Kim Bailey tweeted the news was \u201ca huge disaster for slow horses\u201d and suggested the land might now be sold for housing. Towcester\u2019s management had sold off its better fixtures while the track was still in business, so the action there rarely generated headline news. An exception was the day that Sir Anthony McCoy rode his 4,000th winner in front of a crowd of rare size and enthusiasm. ARC revealed that it had bought Towcester\u2019s fixtures and will now distribute them among its 16 tracks. The British Horseracing Authority expressed sadness at the news and insisted that the fixtures would still have to be used for jump racing. At Musselburgh, however, things are looking up after the contract to run the track east of Edinburgh was awarded to the company that runs Chester and Bangor. A successful track after many years of profits being reinvested, Musselburgh had become the subject of a power struggle between the local authority and those appointed to oversee the business, which is now hoped to be a thing of the past. Meanwhile, the field for Sunday\u2019s Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe is likely to be the smallest for at least a dozen years, following four withdrawals on Tuesday. Mehdaayih, Musis Amica, Silverwave and Matchwinner were taken out, leaving just 12 in the race, although the French-trained Soft Light is expected to be a supplementary entry on Wednesday at a cost of \u20ac120,000. Bookmakers introduced him as a 66-1 shot. Wednesday\u2019s best bets Nottingham has passed an inspection this morning but the heavy going is going to present a serious test for the Flat racers there this afternoon and it seems non-runners will be in plentiful supply. It\u2019s not a tempting card for me but 9-1 seems fair enough about Ugo Gregory (3.25), who is drifting back out after early support from the opening 11-1. A Tim Easterby-trained three-year-old sprinter, Ugo Gregory finished strongly to score twice over this course and distance in August. He was then well held when sent to Carlisle for a third race in the space of 15 days but has been given a useful break since then and will be fresher than most of these rivals, though there are 16 of them. It\u2019s officially \u201cgood\u201d at Huntingdon but the amount of recent rainfall there suggests it might ride a bit slower. The two Jonjos could be in for a good day and there\u2019s no denying they\u2019re in form, with four winners from their 10 runners together in the past fortnight. Their progressive mare Phoenix Rock (3.10) has gone up 10lb for a Worcester win but she had plenty in hand that day and another good showing is on the cards at 3-1. The recent form of Global Anchor (4.10) has not been so good but this is only his third run in handicaps and his first with Jonjo Jr aboard. His July effort at Newton Abbot hinted at better to come, blinkers should help and he\u2019s attracting interest at 7-1. Then there\u2019s Transpennine Star (4.40) in the staying handicap hurdle. He showed a good attitude to score on his reappearance at Hexham and has only been raised 3lb. There is a bit more to come from this 7-2 shot. The market doesn\u2019t want to know about Atalanta Breeze (7.40) and indeed the tight turns of Kempton will not be ideal for her. But she was green as anything when winning at Brighton last month and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s ahead of her rating, if she can race more professionally, so the 9-2 is acceptable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
