Tai chi will reduce stress, improve general mobility and \u2013 according to Keanu Reeves's directorial debut \u2013 let practitioners send a Russian boxer the size of a phone box sprawling. Funded by the China Film Group and starring Reeves' Matrix fight choreographer and friend, Man of Tai Chi plays out as an astounding martial arts showcase and a lousy Hong Kong cop thriller. Tiger Hu Chen stars as delivery driver, Tiger Chen Lin-Hu, who moonlights as a fists-for-hire fight star. Reeves appears as Donaka Mark, the black-suited corporate kingpin who recruits Chen, coaxes him into using his gift for monetary gain, then broadcasts his spiritual descent on the internet for an audience of super-rich fight fans. Chen's tai chi teacher, Master Yang (Yu Hai), balances Keanu's Yin. Karen Mok plays the honest cop hoping to shut down the fight ring and return tai chi to its rightful place in the parks of north London. Man of Tai Chi is all hard rock and fast cars, blinding fight scenes and soul-crushing dialogue. It's rarely on-point, frequently absurd. But it displays passion by the fistful. Chen \u2013 a blur of limbs in battle \u2013 holds the lead with a quiet soulfulness. Fans of Keanu's unique acting style will thrill at his new special move: howling maniacally into the camera. You have to love the guy. Only Keanu could make a character as overwrought as Donaka Mark as compelling as a dial tone. Action specialist Yuen Woo-ping directs the fight scenes with an eye on packing in the punches without shedding too much blood to up the age rating. Stars of MMA, Taekwondo and Indonesian pencak silat (represented by a special appearance from The Raid star Iko Uwais) flit across Chen's path to receive their pummelling before dropping back into one of the many plot holes. Reeves rolls into directing with amateurish enthusiasm. He slaps on the jump cuts, riddles the film with time lapse photography and strobe effects. Only rarely does any of it hit home, mostly it tumbles into parody. The moneyed fight fans are shown a greatest hits reel of Tiger's evolution as a fighter. \"Temple, Money, Power,\" reads the on-screen text. \"Kill\". The voiceover announces the name Tiger Chen. I was waiting for it to say \"Der-ek Zoo-land-er\". There's no fun to be had in attacking Reeves or his ambition. He's put his passion on display, you feel churlish ripping it down. But Man of Tai Chi presents a director trying everything to achieve anything. His Chi is restless, his balance off. \"Slower,\" says tai chi teacher Yang. \"Slower, slower\". Sage advice, master."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
