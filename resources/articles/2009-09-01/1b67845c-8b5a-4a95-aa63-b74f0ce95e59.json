The most recent issue of Observer Film Magazine, in its reference to Four Weddings and a Funeral, included among the cast members Simon Cowell. This should, of course, have been the distinguished actor Simon Callow, not the celebrated judge of Pop Idol. In '\"Born to feud: how years of animosity finally split Oasis boys\", a picture caption said: \"A young Liam and Noel Gallagher play together in 1971\". Liam was born in 1972. This mistake arose from wrong information provided by the picture agency. In \"At long last Scotland is getting her history back\" (Scottish edition), the argument that Scottish history has been too long ignored in the nation's classroom was emphasised by reference to \"Bonnie Montrose\". We should have said Bonnie Dundee, of course \u2013 James Graham, the 1st Marquess of Montrose, having never been known as \"Bonnie\", especially after he was executed and his head put on a spike. It is our policy to correct mistakes as soon as possible.
