Buoyed by the \u201ceat out to help out\u201d scheme, Peru Perdu, a Peruvian themed eatery in the heart of the city was looking for someone to join its serving staff. Within four days, 320 people had applied. And by the time the ad was taken down, 947 people had submitted applications. \u201cNormally we would have between 20 and 30 for a role like this,\u201d recruitment consultant Abi Dunn, who posted the ad, told Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches for a programme to be broadcast on Monday night. \u201cI\u2019m shocked by that, and it\u2019s a real indication of where the sector is at. Definitely we\u2019re recruiting in different times.\u201d Among those applying was Faye, a dancer on a cruise ship. She has been forced to move back in with her parents and was struggling to find a job that paid even the minimum wage. \u201cIt took me a long time to get a job on the cruise ships. It took me two years of auditioning. I\u2019m quite small for a dancer \u2013 5ft 2in \u2013 and I found it really difficult to break through that wall and get my job \u2013 which was actually my dream job. It\u2019s what I always wanted to do.\u201d When asked about how many jobs she\u2019s applied for, she said, \u201cit feels like hundreds. I think it might be hundreds. When I first started applying, I was applying for everything. Even things I was probably under-qualified for because, you know, you do feel so desperate.\u201d Among the applicants for the job, even those with years of experience in hospitality were finding it hard to get noticed. Jake was most recently a manager in a luxury hotel. \u201cI thought it would be easier with a degree and 10 years of experience, but it has been a struggle,\u201d he said. \u201cI probably only have one-and-a-half month\u2019s rent left in the bank account \u2026 That would only take me through November.\u201d Admin worker Kerry was one of 1,000 people to lose their jobs at luxury car maker Bentley. \u201cMy savings are going down. I was able to put money in my savings and in the kids\u2019 account \u2013 from there to nothing. I did get a tiny bit of money from universal credit as it is now. I just put it all into the joint account. That was my contribution at the time to paying for the house, because I don\u2019t want to lose this house. I don\u2019t want the kids to not have this any more. I\u2019m not even going to be able to put money away towards Christmas presents this year, and that really upsets me.\u201d One Peru Perdu applicant who did not make it to interview was 51-year-old John. He and his husband, also John, lost their jobs as ticket inspectors in March. \u201cThe amount of jobs that we have applied for between the two of us since end of March-ish has got to be close to 2,000, if not more. It\u2019s very depressing. We\u2019ve burnt through all our savings. It\u2019s a toss-up between do we get gas and electric or do we get food? And even if I do get food, if we\u2019ve got no gas, I can\u2019t cook it!\u201d At Peru Perdu, the search for a new member of waiting staff was whittled down from 947 to just two. But before a final decision could be made, Boris Johnson announced that all pubs, bars and restaurants could operate only a table service except for takeaway and must close at 10pm. As a result, the vacancy was withdrawn. Six weeks after the Peru Perdu job advert went out, Dispatches contacted all those who had applied for the job. Among those who replied, four out of five were still out of work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
