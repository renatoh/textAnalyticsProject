But as England approaches its second national lockdown on Thursday, a communal feeling unites the nation: gloom. If a sound could sum up the country\u2019s mood it would be a long, drawn-out sigh. Give it a few more weeks and it could become a Munchian scream. Working in the Humbugs sweet shop in Chippenham in Wiltshire, Rita Sargant summed up the prospect of a month at home succinctly. \u201cRubbish,\u201d she said. \u201cLife\u2019s for living. I\u2019m 89 and if I get Covid, get me a bottle of whisky and a box of chocolates and leave me.\u201d Whereas the panic-buying first time around was focused on toilet rolls and tinned tomatoes, this time people are stockpiling for comfort, she said. \u201cPeople love their sweets. They\u2019ve been coming in to stock up.\u201d In the supermarkets, yeast and bread flour \u2013 the \u201cIt\u201d ingredients of the first wave \u2013 remain in plentiful supply, suggesting England is now happier on the sofa watching Bake Off instead of baking their own bread. Asked what she would do during lockdown, Sargant replied: \u201cGod knows, I\u2019ll go mad. Last time, I spent a lot of time in the garden, but I can\u2019t do that this time because of the weather. I\u2019ll walk three or four miles a day to keep me going.\u201d Millions of people kept fit with Joe Wicks during lockdown part one, but even the Body Coach himself cannot face daily workouts this time. The 34-year-old said he was going to share three new workouts a week until the latest lockdown is over, \u201chowever long that takes\u201d. Talking to Radio 4\u2019s You And Yours on Tuesday, Wicks admitted it was hard to get motivated to exercise during winter \u201cwhen it\u2019s dark and grim and wet\u201d. Gyms are supposed to close on Thursday, but several insist they will defy the law and stay open. The owners of Gainz, a 24-hour gym in Bedford, posted a statement on Instagram explaining their reasoning. \u201cWe witnessed a breakdown in people\u2019s mental health during the first lockdown and this isn\u2019t something anybody wants to repeat,\u201d they wrote. Bedfordshire police said it was aware of the post and said that as the legislation is not yet in force, the council was leading on the matter. A beauty salon in Liverpool also said it would not shut up shop, vowing to fight the lockdown in court. Skin Kerr in Bootle has already been shut down once for displaying posters saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t catch what doesn\u2019t exist\u201d, as well as banning masks and \u201cCovid talk\u201d. However, overall, the prevailing mood is one of weary resignation rather than defiance. Back in Chippenham on Tuesday, the town was bustling. Some people were buying Christmas presents and wrapping paper, others taking advantage of pre-lockdown offers. One of the charity shops was offering everything at half price. Barbers, hairdressers, tattoo parlours, pubs were doing a brisk trade. Chippenham is in a tier 1 area, meaning the pubs have been able to stay open until now. Lorna Noble, 28, the landlady of the Black Horse, was pessimistic about the weeks ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard times for us. It\u2019s one thing after another. We had the first lockdown, then the 10pm curfew, which was a big blow for us, now lockdown again.\u201d She has had to let half her staff go. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure what the future holds.\u201d In Greater Manchester, the pubs have been shut for almost two weeks already under tier 3 measures \u2013 at least those who weren\u2019t able to force clients to order a \u201csubstantial meal\u201d with every pint. But the region, along with much of Lancashire and West Yorkshire, has in effect been in tier 2 since 31 July. All household mixing has been banned indoors, causing a slump in trade as the weather has turned. In Old Trafford, Rosalyn Wilde, a construction bid manager, said little would change for her on Thursday. \u201cFor us having been in lockdown for a long time, it doesn\u2019t really feel that different, and I am happy to grin and bear it for a few weeks if it means we have any chance of seeing family at Christmas. I do feel that if it drags on longer than the four weeks though that people will start ignoring the advice,\u201d she said. She thinks the country should already be in a national lockdown and that government rhetoric is not helping the widening gap between the north and south. \u201cThe thing that annoyed me when the talks were ongoing in Greater Manchester about going into tier 3 was the constant commentary about how the rate in some parts of the country was low, so a national lockdown wouldn\u2019t be \u2018fair\u2019. \u201cMy two responses to that were that first, the rate in pretty much every part of the country was higher than it was in Trafford when we were put under local lockdown, and second, there was a national lockdown in March when Covid was mainly prevalent in the south with few cases \u2018up north\u2019, but none of us up here blamed those \u2018down south\u2019.\u201d She is still cross after a government minister only a few weeks ago justified local lockdowns by saying the rate in Cornwall was low. \u201cI checked, and it was pretty much the same as the rate here when we were put under restrictions \u2013 that really wound me up,\u201d she said. In the Stockport suburb of Romiley, Shaun Rowark, a senior healthcare analyst, resented the implication that the national lockdown was only happening now because the north couldn\u2019t get its house in order. In the House of Commons on Monday, Boris Johnson repeatedly thanked the residents of various Tory constituencies in tier 1 for working hard to keep disease levels low, while apologising for putting them under lockdown. \u201cI would like to know what evidence he has that their behaviour has been better than ours,\u201d said Rowark. \u201cGreater Manchester has one of the biggest student populations in the country and that\u2019s where [many] of the infections have been \u2013 it\u2019s not because tier 3 residents are not behaving.\u201d Romiley is in the Conservative-held constituency of Hazel Grove, but many locals are starting to despair at the government\u2019s approach. Johnson\u2019s remarks were \u201ccondescending\u201d, tutted Pat Willetts, a grandmother. \u2018\u201cInstead of congratulating parts of the country, he should be focusing on making the rules simpler so that everyone understands what they need to do,\u201d she said. \u201cToo much has been focused on the financial costs of lockdown rather than public health and safety, and we should have been in a national lockdown much earlier than this.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
