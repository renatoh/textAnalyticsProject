He must therefore be congratulated for avoiding the \"it's not you, it's me\" cliche in his break-up speech on Thursday. Indeed, it became clear as his hilariously passive-aggressive farewell unfolded, that it was as much us as him. Expectations were \"too high, in a way, for either of us\". Unless I am mistaken, and he did exhaust his benefit-of-the-doubt privileges some time ago, there was a curious sense in which it was we who had let him down as opposed to the other way round. Could I have done more, I wondered. Heaven knows there's not a day that goes by when I don't curse myself for not being there for the guy over Iraq. But no ... the relationship is still too raw for analysis. In using this device, though, Mr Blair propagates a fiction about the British: namely, that they are contrary folk, who will no more come to heel over liberal intervention than measure bananas in centimetres. And yet, rather like the acceptance of a departing lover's \"it's not you\" line, this is little more than a lie we tell ourselves. Oh we'll march, and we'll ring radio phone-ins to whine, but in the end we'll vote him back in - if we even bother to turn out. We find very little worth the argument. In short, we are rather light on popular resistance heroes, so when some cosmic aberration throws one up on our shores, their noble struggle must be sung from the rooftops. And we are here today to celebrate one Tracy Daly, landlady of the Tan Hill Inn, a traditional English pub on the Pennine Way. Almost at the precise moment on Thursday that Mr Blair was delivering his speech, Ms Daly was being informed by lawyers for Kentucky Fried Chicken that it had decided to drop its legal case against her, which had hitherto been described as \"extremely serious\". Once a year, you see, Ms Daly offers a Christmas dinner to customers that she chooses to call a \"Family Feast\". Perhaps anxious to book themselves a place in a circle of hell more central than the one they have already assured, the leading City law firm Freshfields contacted her with a cease-and-desist instruction, as \"Family Feast\" is apparently a trademarked KFC term. Quite naturally, when considered alongside the fact that the letter's signatory was one Giles Pratt, Ms Daly assumed this communique to be an April Fool. When investigation revealed her optimism to be hopeless, she refused to back down, and her triumph should see her elevated to the insufficiently esteemed rank of local hero. Some years ago, in a Canadian newspaper, I happened on the story of a man who felt he had been wrongly fined for a parking violation, and vowed to contest it until the fine was overturned. As I recall, the fine was around the $60 mark, and he had spent over $120,000 fighting the case. Having obtained his number from the local telephone directory, I rang him, and discovered he was not a billionaire with a masochistic streak, but a man of average professional income who had somehow retained a sense of humour about his epic pursuit of the matter - which, as he wryly admitted, seemed little nearer conclusion than it had a few years previously. Clearly, he continued, he had not embarked on it intending to spend $120,000, but at no individual point, as the bills mounted up, did he find himself able to think: \"OK, you win.\" I have every confidence that, were anyone able to find him now, he would still be engaged in this stupendously heroic struggle. I remember thinking his vaguely absurdist streak knitted him into the tradition of that classic Groucho Marx correspondence with Warner Brothers, the makers of Casablanca, when the studio discovered the Marxes were filming something called A Night in Casablanca. Upon receipt of an \"ominous legal document\", Groucho put pen to paper. \"I had no idea that the city of Casablanca belonged exclusively to Warner brothers,\" he deadpanned. \"What about Warner Brothers? You probably have the right to use the name Warner, but what about Brothers? Professionally we were brothers long before you were ... And before us there had been other brothers - the Smith Brothers, the Brothers Karamazov, Dan Brothers, an outfielder with Detroit ...\" It went on. The case was eventually dropped. It would be fanciful to think that the synchronicity of Ms Daly's victory and the Blair departure speech hints at some turn of the tide. On the form book, Ms Daly will remain the exception to our rich tradition of compliance. But she seems to me the very opposite of the pettiness that keeps us usefully distracted from questioning the big things; and at the very least the Tan Hill Inn should become a place of pilgrimage for anyone seeking to inspire themselves into marginally less supine behaviour. After all, you can't fight city hall on an empty stomach. marina.hyde@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
