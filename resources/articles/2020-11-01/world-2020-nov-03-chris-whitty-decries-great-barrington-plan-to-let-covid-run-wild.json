Prof Chris Whitty told MPs on the science and technology committee that the Great Barrington declaration, put forward by three scientists at Oxford, Harvard and Stanford universities, would lead to a very large number of deaths and was unlikely to achieve such widespread immunity that the epidemic would fizzle out naturally. Speaking at the hearing with Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Whitty said he expected the month-long lockdown for England that Boris Johnson announced at the weekend to have the desired effect of bringing the R value below 1 across the country, causing the number of cases to fall. The scientists, who were called before the committee to explain the evidence behind the latest lockdown, said that left unchecked, hospital admissions would exceed levels seen in April, a situation Whitty described as \u201centirely realistic\u201d. Questioned on England\u2019s strategy for lifting the lockdown, Whitty said he expected changes to be made to the three-tier system imposed in October. Vallance said further measures would be needed until the spring to keep infections down. \u201cWe\u2019re likely to need degrees of social distancing and other measures over the course of the winter. It\u2019s only really come springtime and beyond when other things may start to allow some more relaxation,\u201d Vallance said. Vaccines, new drugs and improved testing would all be important for restrictions to be eased, he added. His comments came as Dido Harding, the under-pressure head of NHS test and trace, conceded the system needed to improve during the second lockdown if the country was to recover. Lady Harding has faced criticism for the performance of the six-month tracing system, which last month contacted less than 60% of infected people\u2019s contacts. In an interview conducted at the CBI\u2019s virtual annual conference on Tuesday, she said that the main problem was finding and testing people who had Covid but displayed no symptoms. \u201cEvery country is grappling with the same problem. Despite everyone\u2019s best efforts and all of the work of our team in NHS test and trace to be the second line of defence, the virus is spreading too rapidly and too widely,\u201d she said. \u201cAs we go into another really challenging period for us as a country, it is time for the organisation that I lead to take the next big leap forward. We will be focusing on improving NHS test and trace so that when England emerges from lockdown we are better able to live with Covid.\u201d MPs on the science and technology committee earlier pressed Vallance to explain why he had shown out-of-date modelling from Cambridge University and Public Health England at the prime minister\u2019s announcement of the new lockdown on Saturday. The modelling suggested that deaths could reach 4,000 a day in the coming weeks if nothing were done, a figure the Labour MP Graham Stringer said \u201cfrightened a lot of people around the country\u201d. The modelling was based on the growth of the epidemic before the tier system was brought in and gave unrealistically high numbers of deaths. Vallance defended the decision and said it was one scenario that informed thinking about a reasonable worst-case scenario. More recent results from the Cambridge model point to a much lower daily death rate, bringing it in line with other models that suggest they could reach about 2,000 a day. The Great Barrington declaration calls on governments to protect the most vulnerable and let the rest of society return to life as normal. The aim is to let the virus spread in the young and healthy who build up enough immunity that the epidemic grinds to a halt. Whitty, however, said that with the vast majority of infectious diseases, herd immunity was never achieved naturally, and that it was \u201csimply impractical\u201d to believe vulnerable people in the community, care homes, hospitals and elsewhere could be shielded. Another concern, he said, was that the strategy assumed that \u201cvery large numbers of people would inevitably die\u201d unless all vulnerable people could be identified and isolated perfectly for several years. \u201cOther than that, it no doubt has some merits,\u201d he said. Vallance agreed with the assessment and said Sage, the government\u2019s expert committee, had reviewed the Great Barrington proposal and found \u201cfatal flaws in the argument\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
