MPs were not allowed legal representation to challenge Thomas Legg's unilateral retrospective decision on what was and what was not permitted expenditure. The argument advanced in a resolution of the house was that a private appeal might be allowed to a retired judge, Paul Kennedy, and the Commons agreed \"This process is designed to reflect the opportunity an individual would have in legal proceedings to show why he or she should not be required to make restitution. That opportunity is not available to members in this case because of parliamentary privilege.\" So parliamentary privilege was invoked to prevent MPs using lawyers to defend themselves against the quite arbitrary decisions of a retired mandarin. The press quite understandably has enjoyed a year of MP-baiting and we have a new system which allows any anonymous complaint to be investigated and MPs fined if an official of the new Ipsa quango so decides. The idea that the election would draw a line under this business is now proving far-fetched. I make no defence of my own or fellow MPs' behaviour. But I fear that our courts and lawyers will have an increasing amount of work on their hands as the media maintain their hate campaign against MPs, and some MPs turn to lawyers as there is no one in the Commons able to defend their right to serve their constituents and work as national parliamentarians.
