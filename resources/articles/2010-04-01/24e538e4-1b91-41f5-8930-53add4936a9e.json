May al-Khansa said her client, Ali Sibat, could be beheaded today and urged Lebanese and Saudi leaders to help spare his life. The lawyer said she has called upon Saudi King Abdullah to pardon Sibat, a 49-year-old father of five who made predictions on an Arab satellite TV channel from his home in Beirut. Sibat should have been deported rather than tried in Saudi Arabia because he neither made predictions in the kingdom nor is he a Saudi citizen or resident. \"Ali is not a criminal. He did not commit a crime or do anything disgraceful,\" she said. \"The world should help in rescuing a man who has five children, a wife and a seriously ill mother.\" Sibat was arrested by the Saudi religious police during his pilgrimage to the holy city of Medina in May 2008 and sentenced to death last November. He is one of many people reported arrested every year in Saudi Arabia for practising sorcery, witchcraft, black magic and fortune telling. A Lebanese official said Beirut has received no official confirmation about Sibat's possible execution, and Saudi judicial officials could not be reached for comment. A dozen people demonstrated against the psychic's execution near the Saudi embassy in Beirut's western neighbourhood of Qureitim yesterday. Four of the men wore executioners masks and carried a wooden gallows with a cloth bag hanging from it. One carried a banner that read in Arabic: \"Don't kill.\" Human Rights Watch (HRW) said last year that Sibat's death sentence should be overturned. It also called on the Saudi government to halt \"its increasing use of charges of 'witchcraft', crimes that are vaguely defined and arbitrarily used\". The Saudi justice system, which is based on Islamic law, does not clearly define the charge of witchcraft. Last year HRW raised a number of cases with the Saudi authorities, including that of Egyptian pharmacist Mustafa Ibrahim, who was executed in 2007 after being found guilty of trying to separate a married couple \"through sorcery\" ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
