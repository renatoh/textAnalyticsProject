So difficult has trade been for some over the past couple of years \u2013 just ask JJB and Blacks, for instance \u2013 they have had to go to court to set up a company voluntary arrangement to cut their rents back to a level that enables the business to survive. Well, not so Supergroup, the newly floated business behind the Superdry fashion label. Retail landlords are writing cheques to get a Superdry store in their shopping centres. Of Supergroup's \u00a315m capital expenditure last year \u2013 mostly on new stores \u2013 some \u00a313m was provided by landlords. The retailer is such a crowd-puller that landlords are offering complete fit-out costs for the chain's new shops \u2013 plus paying towards the cost of filling it with stock. The chief executive of one of the biggest shopping centre operators in the US recently descended on li'l ol' Cheltenham \u2013 hardly a fashion mecca, but the location of Superdry HQ \u2013 to urge founder and chief executive Julian Dunkerton to rent some space in his mall. The little orange label is going gangbusters. Profits almost trebled last year, sales almost doubled. The shares have climbed from 535p to \u00a310.00 in four months, making Supergroup the best-performing IPO in Europe this year. The trademark T-shirts, check shirts and joggers appeal to a wide audience. Unlike its preppie rival Jack Wills, it is not the badge of the private school set; it is aspirational for teenagers and also offers a little fashion cred for those who spent their teenage years listening to the Boomtown Rats or the Bay City Rollers and who now reckon that 50 is the new 30. Just a third of the range is womenswear, so there's much more potential there. But is it destined to be a here-today-gone-tomorrow brand like FCUK? Or a new global casualwear giant like Gap? Dunkerton, unsurprisingly, thinks the latter. He reckons his variety of Fifties-Americana-style logos alongside names like Osaka and 77Breed, as well as new ranges such as footwear, will ensure brand fatigue is kept at bay. So is it a buy? Shopper boredom may well set in sometime. It may never go global like Gap. But there's a lot to aim for before then."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
