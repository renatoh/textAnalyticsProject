There's rarely a television equivalent, because truly disastrous shows will rapidly be truncated or pulled. International Cricket (BBC2), though, is absolutely the TV equivalent of the ill-advised Noel Coward revival with a 1970s soap-star, playing to a pensioner and a tramp during a matinee at the Bolton Octagon, with the closure notices posted in the wings. The BBC, after years of being excluded from the sport by Sky and Channel 4, excitedly signed up for highlights from England's tour of Australia at a time when our boys were the Ashes holders and young boys all over Britain were whittling their goal-posts into stumps. Sadly, England capitulated so quickly in the Ashes rematch that two of the games (or 10 days of television) were entirely meaningless. Even so, the BBC was still obliged to screen the subsequent triangular one-day tournament with New Zealand and the Aussies. Astonishingly, England then began to lose to the Kiwis as well. With audiences now down to around 300,000 (lower even than niche arts and business shows), the coverage visibly struggles to find the appropriate tone. Introducing Tuesday's highlights, Rishi Persad tried to escalate the excitement in the approved sporting-anchor manner: \"A massive game for England! Anything less than victory here and they're effectively out of the tournament!\" But the problem with that approach is that, when England duly achieved less than victory, BBC2 was left to cover five more games effectively just declared pointless, the final three of which will almost certainly be between Australia and New Zealand. Back in cricket, the BBC have been caught out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
