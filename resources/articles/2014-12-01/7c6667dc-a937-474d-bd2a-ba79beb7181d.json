Joe Heaton, a US district judge for the western district of Oklahoma, on Friday threw out the lawsuit that had been backed by the Guardian, the Oklahoma Observer and journalist Katie Fretland. The judge found that the plaintiffs had failed to make the case that the press had a first amendment constitutional right to witness the complete execution process. Heaton indicated that he was sympathetic to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, which he called \u201ccompelling\u201d, that \u201ca more open and expansive policy of access and disclosure may be desirable\u201d. But he said reform in this area was not a matter for the courts but for decision-makers; that is, the elected members of the Oklahoma legislature. The ruling means that when Oklahoma comes to make its next judicial killing, on 15 January, it will be able to do so with new restrictions on press access in place. The number of media witnesses will be reduced from 12 to five, the intravenous lines will be inserted into the prisoner before the press is allowed to witness the events, the audio feed will be turned off after the prisoner makes his final statement, and the prison authorities will be able to shut off all observation of the proceedings should the inmate fail to be unconscious within five minutes of the lethal chemicals being injected into him. The ACLU and its media partners, including the Guardian, had argued that Oklahoma had violated the public\u2019s right to know how the ultimate punishment was being wielded when it closed the curtain in the death chamber in the middle of the botched execution of Clayton Lockett in April. Lockett took 43 minutes to die in gruesome circumstances, 27 minutes of which fell after the curtain had been drawn, preventing the press from witnessing events. \u201cThe death penalty represents the most powerful exercise of government authority \u2013 the need for public oversight is as critical at the execution stage as it is during trial,\u201d the plaintiffs argued in the legal challenge. Though the judge agreed with the \u201cneed for public information about governmental processes generally and the need for public confidence in the manner in which the death penalty is applied\u201d, adding that such policy considerations \u201cwould counsel in favor of some sort of broad public or press access such as plaintiffs seek\u201d, he repeated that this was not a constitutional matter for the courts. He said that the US Supreme Court had made clear that the first amendment right of access applied to criminal justice proceedings up to the point at which judgment was achieved at trial. It did not cover the later process of implementing a court\u2019s judgment \u2013 in this case, the death penalty, Heaton ruled. Nor was there any historical tradition that allowed the public to witness executions in Oklahoma, he added. The first legal hanging in the state in 1895 was carried out behind prison walls away from public viewing, and that practice was enshrined in state law in 1908. Lee Rowland, the ACLU\u2019s staff attorney who helped prepare the lawsuit, said: \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed that the court ruled against journalists\u2019 first amendment right to inform the public about what really happens behind Oklahoma\u2019s execution curtain. By denying full and independent information from the press, the state is depriving the public of the right to oversee and assess its death penalty process.\u201d She added: \u201cGiven Oklahoma\u2019s recent botched executions, and its troubling trend towards more secrecy to hide those failures, this decision is a loss for transparency.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
