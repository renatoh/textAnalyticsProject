The lack of a federal policy on the issue particularly affects part-time workers, only 40% of whom receive paid vacation. Overall, close to one in four Americans have no paid vacation whatsoever. The report looked at 21 countries that it described as \u201cadvanced economies\u201d and found that the US was the only one to have zero days of mandatory paid leave."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
