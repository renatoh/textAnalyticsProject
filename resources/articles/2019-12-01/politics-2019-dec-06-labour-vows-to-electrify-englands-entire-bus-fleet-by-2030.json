Jeremy Corbyn said \u201cthe Westminster bubble\u201d didn\u2019t care about buses, despite the fact that so many people rely on them. He said the Conservatives had overseen the cancellation or reduction of 3,000 routes across the country leaving people \u201cisolated and stuck at home\u201d. His party plans to electrify all of England\u2019s 35,000 buses by 2030, reducing their emissions by 72%, and fund a reverse in the cuts to services as well as creating new ones. Labour has pledged to give local authorities the power to regulate bus services and create council-owned bus companies, allowing them to bring down the cost of tickets. In areas where bus services are brought into public control, bus travel would be free to under-25s. \u201cThe Westminster bubble doesn\u2019t care about buses but cuts to bus routes leave so many people isolated, stuck at home and unable to make vital trips out,\u201d said Corbyn. \u201cAway from London, many people have approached me in this election to talk about their local bus route closing down. \u201cThis policy will bring our bus services into the future and help to revitalise our high streets and rebuild local communities. We want people to be proud of their local bus service.\u201d Approximately 700 of the 35,000 buses in England are currently electric, most of which are in London. Labour calculates that the cost of electrifying the rest of the fleet over a 10-year period would be under \u00a34bn, and would be funded through their \u00a3250bn Green Transformation Fund. The party said its costing was based on analysis of the price difference between electric and conventional buses, and included estimates for reimbursing owners of conventional buses for retiring the vehicles early. Based on the 2018 average electricity grid mix, electric buses create 72% less greenhouse gas emissions than standard diesel buses. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, accused the Conservative party of not caring about \u201cbuses nor the people and communities who rely on them\u201d. \u201cThe Tories\u2019 manifesto didn\u2019t pledge a penny to reverse a decade of cuts to local bus services,\u201d he said. \u201cBuses are by far the most used and most important form of public transport but huge budget cuts have caused bus use to plummet to an all time low.\u201d The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, hit back, saying: \u201cLabour\u2019s war on the motorist continues apace.\u201d \u201cLabour won\u2019t be able to deliver a modern bus network because they would raid the roads\u2019 budget and scrap vital new roads and upgrades to fund their fantasy giveaways,\u201d he said. \u201cCorbyn\u2019s Labour would bring gridlock to our roads and gridlock to parliament with their plans for another two chaotic referendums next year.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
