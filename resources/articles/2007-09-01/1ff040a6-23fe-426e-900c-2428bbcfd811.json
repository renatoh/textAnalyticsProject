Won the Hong Kong Sevens in April and lost to South Africa by much less than England did in June. How they see it Confident they can pinch second in the group, having come close to beating England in 2003. Could be a few Samoan-born winners in black shirts on October 20, too. The coach \"Almost the perfect rugby player\" according to one of his coaches, Michael Jones played one Test for Samoa before winning the World Cup with New Zealand in 1987. Cool and confident. The captain Semo Sititi is an influential back-rower after spells at Cardiff, Borders and Newcastle. Sums up Samoa's strength - has pace and flare and tackles like a bag of bricks, but knows when to keep it simple. The linchpin Leicester's Alesana Tuilagi, one of three brothers here - with Anitelea and Henry. A winger built like a particularly large flanker, he was sent off at Twickenham in 2005. How they'll play The Marist Brothers brought the game to Samoa in 1920 and their coach is a Christian who refused to play on Sundays. However, Jones's favourite biblical quote - \"It is better to give than receive\" - hints at his team's not particularly meek and forgiving nature on the field. Key fact An older Tuilagi, Freddie, played in the 1995 World Cup while another, Olutuli, dresses - according to a Samoan tradition - as a woman. Omen Samoa always spring a shock win in northern hemisphere World Cups. Brian Lima, who featured in the famous 1991 humbling of Wales, is here for a record fifth World Cup campaign.
