As a manager, he gives the impression that he would walk through a sheet of plate glass for a victory. Manchester City fans have never turned against him and there will be plenty of others happy to see the old punk rocker punching the air again. Even some of the West Ham players seemed sympathetic to his needs. Whether Pearce's position was ever in serious jeopardy is a question that may never be answered. What is certain is that West Ham were obliging opponents for a manager who had lost 13 of his previous 16 games. Alan Pardew's team were so unrecognisable from the bright, energetic side who reached last season's FA Cup final that they encouraged City to forget their own shortcomings. Players who had been devoid of confidence suddenly found some self-belief. Together, they went a long way to quelling any rumblings that Pearce might have lost his motivational powers. With him by the dug-out was a cuddly toy his daughter Chelsea had given him as a lucky omen. Pearce took \"Beanie\" with him because \"it's difficult explaining to a seven-year-old why I'm known as Psycho\". Equally difficult is working out how a man short-listed for the England job could have found himself under such pressure. Yet Pearce scarcely blinked when he was asked how he had coped with finding his position under scrutiny. \"I've got agreat job. If every now and then a bitof pressure comes your way andyou shit yourself, what chance have you got?\" A soothing win was accomplished thanks to two goals from a striker whose form may be telling in whether Pearce can stay out of trouble. \"When I told the chairman I wanted to sign Georgios Samaras the first thing he said was 'Who?'\" Pearce said. \"It was a gamble because \u00a36m is more than I have ever spent on anyone but I think he's an uncut diamond. He's got a lot to learn but if he continues to show these flashes of brilliance he will be one hell of an assetfor me.\" Samaras's opening goal was certainly of the highest order, a swivelling left-foot volley wholly incongruous in what had hitherto been a drab, best-forgotten match. His second was less spectacular but a controlled and skilfully executed finish. \"He cost a lot of money and people will throw it back in your face every time he misses, but he's got a great attitude,\" said Pearce. \"He wants to improve. He certainly hasn't come here thinking he's the finished article.\" One victory, of course, does not solve all of City's problems and their supporters are entitled to be concerned about the dreary form of their other striker, the Italian Bernardo Corradi, who showed an exquisite touch to set up the second goal but was otherwise disappointing in the extreme. There is also a distinct lack of pace in the team, although the introduction of the youth-team graduate Ishmael Miller provided some penetration on the left wing. City should stay up but it may be a close-run thing. But what of West Ham? Pardew is supposed to have constructed one of the Premiership's brightest teams, yet they struggled to execute even the shortest passing movements. \"We're just not functioning,\" said their manager after a result that extended their run without a win to six matches. \"We cannot seem to get ourselves going.\" That could certainly be said of their Argentinian recruits. Carlos Tevez did not even warrant a place in the starting XI and the visitors' best midfielder was Nigel Reo-Coker rather than Javier Mascherano. It is foolishly premature to believe that two of the world's most coveted players will fail to acclimatise but right now West Ham look as if they need to reinvent themselves.
