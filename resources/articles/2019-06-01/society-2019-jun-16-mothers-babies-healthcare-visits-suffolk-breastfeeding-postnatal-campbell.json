Suffolk County Council \u2013 the area in which health secretary Matt Hancock is an MP \u2013 plans to cut as many as 31 full-time posts from its 120-strong health visitor workforce, through a combination of redundancies and not filling vacancies, despite the team\u2019s key role in family health. Internal council documents seen by the Observer show that the Conservative-controlled authority intends to push through the controversial plan by September in order to save \u00a31m from its health visiting, school nursing and family nurse partnership services. The council is being forced to change the way it provides health services for children and young people because the public health grant it receives from central government has been slashed by \u00a35.47m (16.7%) since 2015/16. The council wants to drastically reduce the role of health visitors so they no longer undertake three of the five checks of mother-and-baby health that all should receive by the time the infant is two-and-a-half years old. In future they will focus on the most vulnerable families \u2013 with nurses, who health visitors say have not had the same training, taking on the other three checks. Health visitors help parents tackle childhood obesity, prepare for their baby to have its childhood vaccinations and ensure that infants bond with their mother and father in the crucial early months. The proposal has triggered a backlash. Local Conservative MPs are warning that \u201cdismantling\u201d Suffolk\u2019s health visiting service will reduce the advice and support that parents receive to help them negotiate the challenges of having a baby. MPs including Jo Churchill and Dr Dan Poulter intend to question council leader Matthew Hicks about the plans at a meeting on 5 July. The documents reveal that north-east Ipswich and coastal Suffolk are due to lose 14 full-time equivalent health visitor posts, and south and west Ipswich 7 posts, because the council has decided to cut the budget of its 0-19 Healthy Child Service by 10%, which is about \u00a31m. Poulter, who served as a health minister in the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, said: \u201cHaving worked hard as a health minister to personally oversee the rebuilding of the health visitor workforce, and increase health visitor numbers by over 4,000 between 2012 and 2015, it is disappointing to see councils like Suffolk dismantling a service that is so important to new families.\u201d The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, recently warned that health visitor numbers had fallen so much since 2015 \u2013 to about 8,000 \u2013 that services for \u201cour youngest generation\u201d were at risk. Retirements, health visitors leaving to do other jobs and a lack of new recruits meant the residual workforce was \u201cbeing stretched to its limits\u201d, it said. Year-on-year Whitehall cuts to public health budgets is leading to councils reducing sexual health and drug and alcohol addiction services, Poulter added. \u201cSadly, it looks as though health visiting services and the families they care for are now also suffering.\u201d He urged ministers to amend the Health and Social Care Act 2012 so that the NHS regains responsibility for public health. One Suffolk health visitor said: \u201cWe\u2019re all feeling very angry and very demoralised by the council\u2019s decision. We all support each other in our work but are now being put in competition with each other for jobs, because we\u2019re all having to reapply for our existing jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s short-sighted to cut health visitor numbers because if a mum who needs health advice about her baby can\u2019t see us she\u2019ll go to her GP or A&amp;E, both of which are already very busy. And it will force mums to go over their baby\u2019s whole history with first their health visitor, and then the nurse that starts doing three of the checks we do now, so our relationships with clinets will be broken.\u201d Suffolk County Council said that Ofsted recently rated its children\u2019s services as \u201coutstanding\u201d. A spokesperson added: \u201cDue to reductions in public health grants and other cost pressures, we have had to make adjustments to the care and support we provide, and often these have proved to be difficult decisions. \u201cHowever, we believe with the new service, and by working collaboratively, we will be able to provide the very best care and support that our children and young people deserve.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
