I\u2019ll be at home, with friends and my husband. It\u2019s a big day for us \u2026 for all South Africans,\u201d said Adelaide Mahlangu, 25, a grocery manager in Johannesburg. When Siya Kolisi leads 14 other players on to the pitch at Yokohama\u2019s International Stadium on Saturday, many will be thinking of another South African captain who led the national team in rugby\u2019s World Cup 24 years ago. The moment when Francois Pienaar received the Webb Ellis cup from Nelson Mandela, the Nobel peace prize-winner and South Africa\u2019s then president, symbolised a new and hopeful future for a country shattered by decades of rule by a repressive, racist apartheid regime. Now, many in the rainbow nation are hoping that the Springboks can win again, and give a similar boost to their troubled and disillusioned country. \u201cEveryone is desperate for a victory here, perhaps even more so than in 1995. People are so desperate for some good news. Defeat might feel like another body blow,\u201d said Daniel Gallan, a South African sports journalist. There has been much progress since the dark days of apartheid, but South Africa remains one of the most unequal countries in the world, with disproportionate wealth in the hands of the white minority. Violent crime is a serious problem, with poor people most likely to be victims. There is deep public frustration with soaring joblessness, patchy delivery of basic services and widespread corruption. Last week Tito Mboweni, the finance minister, forecast cuts and soaring debt. The dreams of 1995 appear very distant. Many of the new hopes are now focused on Kolisi, the Springboks\u2019 first non-white captain. \u201cIf the team was captained by a white guy, we wouldn\u2019t even be talking about how this [match] would reunite the country but because he\u2019s a black guy in a shirt that has meant so many different things at so many different times \u2026 his story is a microcosm of the positivity of new South Africa,\u201d said Gallan. The history of rugby in South Africa \u2013 described as \u201cthe sporting embodiment of white minority rule\u201d \u2013 touches many of the most sensitive issues in a nation where historic grievances are still powerful. Harsh restrictions on non-white players under apartheid led to international bans and South Africa was excluded from the first two Rugby World Cups. In 1995, the team that Pienaar led to victory in the final included just one black player. In 2007, when South Africa won again, there were two. On Saturday, the team\u2019s coach, Rassie Erasmus, is set to field a team with at least seven black players, possibly more. He has described his squad as a celebration of \u201cso many different cultures, players, languages\u201d. None of his players are old enough to clearly remember the apartheid era and several were born after it ended. \u201cThe Boks have more supporters now than when Mandela was alive,\u201d said Sylvester Clinton, an unemployed resident of Bonteheuwel, near Cape Town. Like many of his compatriots, Clinton, 47, sees Kolisi\u2019s astonishing career as evidence of the ongoing transformation of South Africa. Kolisi grew up in deep poverty but was spotted by scouts and won a rugby scholarship to a prestigious school with a record of producing sporting stars. In 2007 he could not afford a television and watched the World Cup in a pub in the poor township in Eastern Cape province where he grew up. Married to a white woman, Kolisi has two mixed-race children and has legally adopted his two half siblings. \u201cI don\u2019t shy away from where I have come from and I\u2019m aware that my story is a typical South African story in some ways. It\u2019s my motivation,\u201d Kolisi, 28, told the Guardian last year . \u201cI tell my team-mates that you should never play just to represent one group. You can\u2019t play to be the best black player or to be the best white player to appeal to a community; you have to play to be the best for every South African. We represent something much bigger than we can imagine.\u201d Kolisi\u2019s appointment as captain prompted Desmond Tutu, one of the best known and loved leaders of the struggle against apartheid, to praise \u201ca wonderful achievement that \u2026 speaks to the hope we felt 24 years ago that we were developing a special society in which the cream would rise to the top regardless of colour or class.\u201d But recent weeks have been marred by rows over alleged racism \u2013 one involving Kolisi\u2019s friend and teammate Eben Etzebeth which has led to an investigation by the South African Human Rights Commission \u2013 and the example of Kolisi has been criticised as misleading by some prominent commentators. \u201cThe inspirational message is that excellence and flourishing are possible end-goals within anyone\u2019s reach regardless of the circumstances of your early childhood \u2026 That\u2019s a seductive lie,\u201d wrote Eusebius McKaiser, a well-known radio presenter. Ralph Mathegka, a political commentator, said South Africa was \u201cso divided and so cynical\u201d that any relief from a victory would only be temporary, noting that where once criticism of black players came from conservative voices within the white community, particularly those angered by quotas designed to increased diversity in the squad, it now came from those who saw them as \u201cselling out\u201d. Yet the interest in the sport and the support for the Springboks is difficult to ignore. Once it would have been almost inconceivable that any one in Gugelethu, a poor township on the outskirts of Cape Town, would turn out to cheer on the national side. On Saturday, Siyabulela Villem, a security guard, will be watching the game with many other residents. \u201cWhen Kolisi was made captain I felt proud, but I was even prouder when he led the team to the final,\u201d the 39-year-old said. \u201cThe Boks are representative of all of us now.\u201d Additional reporting by Vincent Lali in Cape Town"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
