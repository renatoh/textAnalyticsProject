Diskin, man of the match in Leeds's victory over Bradford in the 2004 Grand Final, is recovering from knee reconstruction after suffering serious ligament damage on his Test debut against New Zealand in November. However, the injury has not stopped the Bulls making an official approach to Leeds asking them to name their price for the 23-year-old after his contract expires at the end of the season. Leeds dismissed the approach out of hand, accusing Bradford of breaching Super League clubs' usual protocol by going public. Gary Hetherington, the Rhinos' chief executive, also suggested the Bulls' bid was motivated by sour grapes after their complaint that Leeds had made illegal approaches for the Bradford forwards Jamie Peacock and Jamie Langley was dismissed by the Rugby Football League last week. Chris Caisley, the Bulls' chairman, denied those allegations. \"This has nothing to do with anything that's happened in the past,\" he said. \"We just need a hooker. That should be obvious to anyone. I'm surprised Gary hasn't noticed.\" Relations between the two clubs have hit rock bottom since Bradford signed Iestyn Harris from Welsh rugby union last summer; a Leeds claim against the Bulls and their former captain is to be heard in the High Court this year. Caisley denied that Bradford had also made an approach to sign Wigan's hooker Terry Newton. Ryan Hudson, whom the Bulls signed from Castleford during the winter in the latest attempt to fill a position which has been a problem since the retirement of James Lowes, was suspended indefinitely by the club before the season after a positive drug test and is expected to be dismissed if found guilty of a doping offence at an RFL hearing tomorrow week. However, London Broncos are standing by Danny Williams, their Australian forward who will appear at a hearing on the same day charged with refusing to take a drug test. He has still to play for London because he is serving an 18-match ban given him for foul play in Australia last year. But Nic Cartwright, the Broncos' chief executive, said the club had not imposed any additional penalty. Cartwright also said the Broncos might not be able to stage their home game with Wigan, due to be shown live on Sky on Saturday week, if their landlord, Brentford FC, beat Southampton in an FA Cup fifth-round replay and secure a quarter-final against Manchester United at Griffin Park. \"If Brentford get through we're hoping to play on the Sunday,\" he said. \"But if Brentford are playing on the Sunday we can't have the pitch on the Saturday - and at the moment we can't find an alternative.\" Widnes' Australian captain Shane Millard did not break his jaw in their 66-8 thrashing at Leeds and hopes to be fit for Sunday's home game against Wigan. The Warriors will definitely be without their second-row Gareth Hock, who suffered medial ligament damage during last Friday's home defeat by Bradford. Paul Sculthorpe and Sean Long will be missing from St Helens' 20-man squad for Friday's game at Warrington because of leg injuries."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
