The group's annual report for last year shows that Heavey, who founded the business in 1985 and built it into a FTSE 100 firm, received a pay package worth \u00a32.36m, including a base salary of \u00a3815,340, up 20% on the year before. During the year he also qualified to receive shares worth \u00a32.06m, and can take ownership of these at any time of his choosing. Heavey is among the world's most successful oil exploration executives and has enjoyed some of the biggest paydays seen at a stock market-listed company. In 2008 he was the second highest-paid director of a FTSE-100 company, according to the Guardian's executive pay survey, receiving \u00a328.8m after cashing in a mountain of from options he had accumulated over several years. In Tullow's 2011 annual report, the group's remuneration committee said: \"Executive directors' salaries were becoming less competitive ... Consequently, [thus] the committee has approved salary increases of 20% for 2011.\" A spokesman said that, for the same reason, awards of restricted shares were doubled to 300,000 for 2011. These shares \u2013 worth \u00a34.34m today \u2013 are subject to performance criteria that the company has described as \"stretching\" but many shareholders believe the awards are excessive. At the group's annual meeting last year, 46% of voting shares were cast in protest \u2013 either against or in abstention \u2013 at Tullow's plans to double its potential long-term payouts. In its annual report, Tullow's remuneration committee chairman, David Bamford, claims to be \"very aware of the sensitive nature of executive remuneration\" and \"regularly considers\" the views of the Association of British Insurers and the business secretary, Vince Cable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
