And I'd take some peas. What would you have for your last supper? I'd have to have something really, really Thai \u2013 something really heavily spiced. Say a really decent Thai jungle curry with guinea fowl. What foodstuff would you put in Room 101? Ready meals \u2013 ping cuisine. I don't think it's that difficult to drop a couple of ingredients in a wok, stir-fry them and put a bit of dressing on them. What's your favourite table? There's a place in Portugal called Maria's. It's in the Algarve, on the beach, down a dirt track. They have a big container full of coals where they cook the fish, and you drink rose, and you eat salad, and you look at the water \u2026 and when you get drunk, you jump in. What's your poison? Water, coffee, wine \u2013 in that order. During hot summers, I go for a crisp south Australian riesling; in colder weather definitely big French burgundies. Which book gets you cooking? Elizabeth David's Summer Food is always inspiring. It's not a cookbook in a way, it's more of a conversation about food. My copy is quite tattered. What's your dream dinner party line-up? My wife, because she would keep everyone in line. I would have loved to meet John Gielgud and have a decent conversation with him. Orson Welles, because he was a great raconteur and had that extraordinary voice. An extraordinary socialist in Australia called Bruce Ruckston - he's horribly outspoken, but as a dinner party conversationalist he'd be good. So they're mostly male \u2026 I think Lucy Liu's quite nice - but I don't think my wife would like that at all. What was your childhood teatime treat? Crumbed lamb cutlets. It's not something you'd do here, because lamb is so very expensive, but lamb in Australia is quite cheap. Take a rack of lamb, cut it up into cutlets, dip them in eggs, flour and breadcrumbs, and fry them. They're delicious. What would you cook to impress a date? I'd impress my wife with a big hunk of roast beef, roast potatoes and creamed leeks, or a big hunk of roast pork with lots of crackling, apple sauce and bread sauce. Who would you most like to cook for? I love the idea of being quite egalitarian. Running a restaurant like Smith's means we get to cook for lots of people [each of the four floors caters for a different budget]. So no one in particular - I like to cook for my friends. What was your most memorable meal? I don't necessarily believe in temples of gastronomy, although I had a fantastic nine-course meal at Jean Georges in New York. It was impromptu: I just walked in for something to eat, and he knew who I was and gave me huge amounts of food. Really recently, I went to Helen Darroze at the Connaught and I've got to say, it was absolutely fantastic. Really fantastic. I prefer casual dining, but I also like being surprised. Doing Masterchef, I have to analyse food, but I don't like analysing it; I like enjoying it. I'm excited by a really great burger from an Australian fish and chip shop, dumplings in China Town, crispy duck pancakes \u2026 What was your biggest food disaster? Shit, there's been loads of them - I mean absolutely heaps of them. Professionally I think the biggest disaster was my first big launch. There were all these balloons on the ceiling filled with tiny bits of glitter. All the main courses went out, then at midnight, all the balloons exploded and covered the food in glitter and it all got sent back to the kitchen. We were still cooking at 2.30 in the morning \u2013 it was absolutely horrendous. On Masterchef, there was a classic moment when a contestant decided she was going to make melanzane parmagiana: layers of eggplant, tomato and parmesan cheese. The issue was that she didn't have any parmesan cheese, so she used chickpeas instead, and served up a huge tray of what can only be described as dog food. What's the worst meal you've ever had? This year we went to a place called Abama in Tenerife. We went to one restaurant that was quite expensive, and after waiting two-and-a-half hours we finally got something to eat that wasn't what we ordered. My wife got prawns that were still warm because they'd been defrosted in the microwave. I got a piece of beef that was still absolutely raw \u2013 I mean completely raw. We sent it back, only to find that the chefs had all gone home and the kitchen was closed. They threw our meals away, so we didn't actually eat anything at all, and then they charged us 80 quid for the wine. What's the most outlandish thing you've ever eaten? I ate some really amazing food in Thailand. I had river turtle, and dried rat, which was quite chewy and interesting and a bit like biltong. Who's your food hero/food villain? My food hero would be someone like Elizabeth David, because I think what she did for Britain was amazing. Also David Thompson, an Australian chef who does Thai food and really understands the basis of it, has always been very inspiring. I don't think I could single out a food villain. Greg [Wallace, Torode's co-presenter on Masterchef] is a rogue, not a villain. He's a rogue who loves life. Maybe the person who made Food Poker, that ridiculous TV programme, is a villain. Nigella or Delia? Delia, absolutely. She doesn't look at you as if she's about to have sex with everybody. I can't do the whole Nigella thing [mimes pouting and bosom-thrusting]. What are you talking about? Did you cook it or not? And who has a perfect life like that? Much as we'd all like to, I don't think anyone really does. Vegetarians: genius or madness? Oh, complete madness. What's the use of them? 'Vegetarian' is just another word for 'bad hunter'. We have teeth to chew food with. I have no qualms with people who want to be vegetarians; it's just foolish. They are missing out on the best things in life: meat, cheese, proper Christmas pudding. Starter or pudding? Starter, absolutely. I've not got a sweet tooth at all. I'd rather eat cheese, I'd rather eat a salad with some duck in it. Fusion food or Best of British? I believe in classic cuisines being very well done. In the dining room here, I've got a classic Thai squid dish sitting next to a steak and chips and a belly pork and mashed potatoes, and next to that is a Chinese roast duck, but they're all properly done. I don't have an issue with it. But I do have an issue when fusion becomes confusion. I don't like the idea of Chinese duck with tomatoes, for example. That doesn't work. What's the best/worst thing about the British food scene? The best thing is that right here, right now, the Brits are beginning to understand that they produce great, great food. And I'm really excited about that, because it's taken me bloody years to get you guys to realize that your food might be OK. The worst thing is that there are too many people out there who still believe it's just sustenance. They don't enjoy it; they eat food for fuel. I hate all those energy drinks and all that sort of stuff \u2013 I just think it's all going a bit far. But the really worst thing is all the professionals out there who claim that they've been doing British food for a long time, when actually I know they've been getting their ingredients from France. There are people jumping on the bandwagon all the time. And let's remember who's still at the top of the food hierarchy in Britain: Michelin. It's French. I'm Australian, but I didn't come over here to cook Australian food, I came to cook British food, because I believe it's fantastic. I don't serve French cheese; I serve English cheese. What's the next big thing? I think there's a whole back to basics approach. I think there's going to be a lot more people enjoying cooking on weekends \u2013 what I would call the hobby cook. Parsnips and cauliflowers are quite big out there at the moment. Chefs are using them in various guises: in sauces and stews, sweet and sour \u2026 But if I really knew what the next big thing is going to be, I would invest in it. What would you do if you weren't a chef and restaurateur? Shrivel up and die. Honestly. I don't think there's anything else I could do. I like the idea of learning to water ski better and being fitter, but that's all about spare time. I love what I do. The first person I ever worked with in television warned me that television is a big balloon, and it's run by a pack of pricks. It only takes one prick to burst your balloon, and then it's all over: here today, gone tomorrow. It's so true. And I'm not a celebrity for celebrity's sake. There's no way in the world I'd want to work in TV full time. Make a wish I wish that everybody in 2008 will have roast beef on Christmas day rather than turkey. And if you don't how to cook it, you need to go to John Torode's Beef And Other Bovine Matters, which will tell you exactly what to do. Ha ha! \u2022 Beef And Other Bovine Matters by John Torode is out now, priced \u00a320.
