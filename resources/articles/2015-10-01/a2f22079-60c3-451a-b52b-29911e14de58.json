Ben Fields, who had been suspended without pay since Monday, is no longer a deputy with the Richland County sheriff\u2019s department, sheriff Leon Lott announced on Wednesday after his department completed an internal investigation. \u201cHe was wrong and so was his action. It\u2019s not what I expect of my deputies,\u201d Lott said. \u201cHe picked a student up, and he threw a student across the room. Based on that, that is a violation of our policy.\u201d \u201cI do not feel the proper procedure was used at that point, and that\u2019s what caused me my heart burn, and my issues with this. The maneuver that he used was not based on the training or acceptable.\u201d The Department of Justice is reviewing the incident for any potential civil rights violations; Lott has asked the FBI to investigate Fields\u2019 actions for any criminal violations. Video that showed Fields manhandling the student for refusing to leave her chair provoked outrage nationwide this week. At a school board hearing on Tuesday night, parents accused the district\u2019s leaders of negligence and said the altercation reveals race issues. Lott said responsibility for initiating the incident falls on the student, but that didn\u2019t justify Fields\u2019 actions, which he said were in violation of the department\u2019s training procedures. \u201cThis whole incident started by this student. She is responsible for initiating this action. There\u2019s some responsibility that falls on her. Now the actions of our deputy \u2013 that falls on [us].\u201d \u201cNow, what she did doesn\u2019t justify what our deputy did. It doesn\u2019t justify his actions. But she must be held responsible for what she did.\u201d Superintendent Dr Debbie Hamm who oversees the school said in a statement that the school district will continue to work closely with the sheriff\u2019s department and federal and state agencies to examine exactly what happened. Officials \u201cknow important work is ahead of us as we thoughtfully and carefully review the decision-making process that may lead to a school resource officer taking the lead in handling a student disruption\u201d, Hamm said. The superintendent added the goal is to de-escalate situations through problem-solving and communication techniques, while avoiding confrontations. Columbia attorney Todd Rutherford told ABC\u2019s Good Morning America on Wednesday that Fields should have been fired as soon as Sheriff Leon Lott saw the video recorded by several students at Spring Valley high school in Columbia. \u201cShe now has a cast on her arm, she has neck and back injuries. She has a Band-Aid on her forehead where she suffered rug burn on her forehead,\u201d Rutherford told the network. In a statement released through his lawyer on Wednesday, Fields thanked those who offered support of his actions during Monday\u2019s incident, which his lawyer has said were \u201cjustified and lawful\u201d. \u201cTo that extent, we believe that Mr Fields\u2019 actions were carried out professionally and that he was performing his job duties within the legal threshold.\u201d Lott had said Tuesday that the girl was uninjured in the confrontation but \u201cmay have had a rug burn\u201d. When the incident happened on Monday, Lott was at a policing conference in Chicago, where the FBI director, James Comey, sought to blame the \u201cera of viral videos\u201d for a perceived spike in violent crime as officers begin to fear being recorded. Lott, however, said he welcomed his deputies being recorded on the job, and that some districts take too long to investigate such incidents. \u201cOur citizens should police the police. That\u2019s their job, too.\u201d Fields\u2019 initial suspension was not nearly enough for one parent, who asked the school board on Tuesday night: \u201cYou\u2019re beating up little girls in school and you\u2019re thinking about firing him?\u201d Others simply expressed their disgust for the officer\u2019s behavior at Spring Valley high school, including one mother who said: \u201cif I want to put my hand on my child that\u2019s my business, but for somebody else to grab my child, that\u2019s just despicable.\u201d But the school board hearing also exposed fault lines in the community. Rebecca Woodford, a mother of Spring Valley students, told local WSPA news: \u201cMy daughters all love him.\u201d The school board released a statement about the incident, with chairman James Manning saying he found the video \u201cextremely disturbing\u201d. \u201cThe amount of force used on a female student by a male officer appears to me to be excessive and unnecessary,\u201d Manning said. He said that the county superintendent, Debbie Hamm, had contacted the sheriff to make sure the deputy was banned from all district schools. Hamm also released a statement, saying the district is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d and \u201cstudent safety is and always will be the district\u2019s top priority. The district will not tolerate any actions that jeopardize the safety of our students.\u201d Lott on Tuesday told reporters he \u201cwanted to throw up\u201d after watching the video, but added that he doubted any racial element to the incident, in part because Fields has dated an African American woman for \u201cquite some time\u201d.
