Albion's manager made the request in the match programme and, given his constant hyperactivity in the technical area, it suggests a case of don't do as I do but as I say. As if to prove the point he was left clutching his head in his hands after Cardiff's substitute Alan Lee had cancelled out Neil Clement's opener. Megson, however, was not alone in not doing his bit to keep the fans onside. His players did not help by opting to defend their one-goal lead, a tactic that turned the Hawthorns into a simmering cauldron of anxiety. Indeed, it came close to boiling point when the Cardiff striker Robert Earnshaw had an effort disallowed for offside, the tension only abating once Lee Hughes prodded home the winner. Perversely, Albion had played some commendably controlled football before Clement headed home Jason Koumas's free-kick - none more so than Hughes, a man troubled by worries of substance as opposed to footballing trivia. The Cardiff supporters focused on those troubles and the striker's goal was the perfect riposte to taunts that were nothing less than repugnant. \"It is remarkable Lee Hughes has been able to carry on playing like he has with the difficult situation going on around him,\" said the Albion defender Darren Moore. \"You could see how delighted everyone was for Lee when he got the goal and we appreciate the way he has kept battling on. \"But he typifies what this club is all about. We had a sticky patch a little while ago but are starting to put some good results together again. We have given ourselves a chance and we don't want to let it slip now. There is a lot of confidence in the side and we are going in the right direction.\" Cardiff's manager Lennie Lawrence was left to reflect on his team conceding a costly late goal for the second game in succession and also some missed opportunities. \"We lost concentration on three or four occasions and were punished twice. If you get three or four chances against a team like West Brom it is imperative you take them. In the final analysis we were just that bit short in both penalty areas.\" Man of the match: Lee Hughes (West Bromwich)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
