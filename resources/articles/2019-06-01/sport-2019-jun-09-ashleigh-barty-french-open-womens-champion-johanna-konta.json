Ashleigh Barty\u2019s uncomplicated realism helped her win her breakthrough major and, if they meet at Wimbledon next month, their clash of philosophies will inform the course of the championship. The British No 1 left Paris with five wins and a loss, butchering set point with an ill-judged drive volley (that she then packed away for the rest of the semi-final) to let Marketa Vondrousova escape from 5-3 down in the semi-finals on Friday and advance to Saturday\u2019s decider where the Czech teenager\u2019s composure evaporated in the face of Barty\u2019s fearless and intelligent shot-making. A final between them would surely have been a tighter contest, a chess match of penetrative hitting by the battle-hardened Konta and the subtleties of the Australian\u2019s game. Winning the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen lifted Barty to No 2 in the world and Konta, who played the best clay-court tennis of her career, moved up to 18. Now, as they switch to grass, their favourite surface, over the next several weeks at Birmingham, Eastbourne and Wimbledon, they will have to reset their techniques and ambitions. Konta wants to give herself \u201can opportunity to do well\u201d, as she puts it. Barty is aiming higher: to become only the second Australian woman to reach No 1 in the world \u2013 emulating her hero, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, who ruled for two weeks in 1976. \u201cObviously that\u2019s the next point, the next goal, the next situation I can see myself in,\u201d Barty said. \u201cBeing No 2 in the world is incredible. It\u2019s something I never dreamed of as a child. But we\u2019ll keep chipping away and try our best to get to No 1.\u201d The British grass holds fond memories for Barty, who returned from her two-year exile at Eastbourne in 2016. \u201cI was very nervous,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI only got in the draw because it wasn\u2019t full in qualifying. It was pretty nice to be back and almost slip into tournament mode straight away. My routines and my habits came back very quickly. I remember at the end of the week my body was shot. I wasn\u2019t used to playing matches again. I played some pretty good tennis considering it was my first matches back. It feels like yesterday I was there.\u201d There is a strand of candour running through nearly everything she says. She sugarcoats nothing and embraces the bad with the good, admitting after her semi-final win over Amanda Anisimova that she had played, \u201csome brilliant tennis and some awful tennis\u201d. That made it logical to believe her assessment after dismissing Vondrousova in 70 minutes in the final, that she had played \u201cthe perfect match\u201d. She has other incentives to match Goolagong Cawley, who texted her after the win. \u201cThe pathways and the progress that we\u2019ve made for indigenous youth in Australia have been incredible,\u201d Barty said. \u201cThere have been more opportunities. There\u2019s more publicity and people are actually aware that there is a pathway for indigenous youths to enjoy, not only in tennis but all other sports. \u201cTennis is now becoming a nationwide sport for indigenous youth. It\u2019s incredible to know what Evonne has done and how passionate she is about it. If I can have any small part in it, that would be incredible.\u201d Her parents, Josie and Robert \u2013 who watched the final on TV in the UK after landing at Heathrow from Australia on the day of the match \u2013 will be with her for the second chapter of her summer odyssey. \u201cThey were with family,\u201d Barty said. \u201cI have some great aunts and uncles in Nottingham. They were with them at their place all glued to the TV.\u201d Barty remembers Nottingham for other reasons: the final there against Konta a year ago, which she won from 4-1 down in the third. It was not such a happy occasion for Konta, whose \u201cacceptance\u201d briefly deserted her when she described a line call against in the penultimate game as \u201ca joke\u201d. All part of the journey, of course. On Sunday Barty, who played two seasons of women\u2019s Big Bash before returning to tennis, watched Australia\u2019s World Cup match against India on TV in Paris. \u201cI sent JL [Justin Langer, the coach] a quick message saying I would have loved to have been there. It was really nice to hear from them as well. I\u2019ll be glued to the TV and I will make sure I see it.\u201d Martina Navratilova is among many former players and experts who expect Barty\u2019s run to continue \u2013 on the tennis court. \u201cThis could be a great springboard for her,\u201d she said. \u201cI am so glad the sport has got her back. She must be one of the favourites for Wimbledon now. She has the slice and great variety in her game. I don\u2019t think she is a one-slam wonder. I think we will see her win again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
