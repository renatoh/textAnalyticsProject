Time goes fast when you\u2019re old.\u201d At 75, the Canadian musician\u2019s spiritual blend of minimalism, new-age electronica, folk and lieder-style singing is having a moment, spurred on by a reissue of his 1986 album Keyboard Fantasies in 2017, and this year\u2019s rerelease of 2004\u2019s cosmic Primal Prayer, alongside a film, and his first ever world tour. Tonight he plays for the first time with a new band, the Pangea Players, their synthesisers, clarinet and double bass creating a warm bath of spectral sound behind him. Opening song Ever New lays the template for the hour: soft, pentatonic arpeggios rolling behind lyrics that immerse us in a profound appreciation of nature and life. \u201cWelcome the spring / the summer rain,\u201d Glenn-Copeland sings, belly-deep, his voice a shivery, haunted relative of Nina Simone\u2019s. \u201cWelcome the child whose hand I hold / welcome to you both young and old / we are ever new.\u201d Wise but playful on stage, his between-song chat is deeply informed by the Buddhism he\u2019s been practising, he tells us, for 48 years. There\u2019s also a sweet naivety to his music that echoes his past as a children\u2019s TV regular (he composed for Sesame Street and Canadian series Mr Dressup, in which he also performed). La Vita is a highlight tonight, sounding like a wayward trance classic, the stunning baritone of Alex Samaras pushing its propulsiveness to higher planes. So too is Harbour, an unapologetically sentimental love song written for Glenn-Copeland\u2019s wife. Then there\u2019s his version of the spiritual Deep River. Sung alone, it ends with him hand-drumming \u2013 solo, syncopated rhythms emerging from his hands as naturally as the air flowing through the room. Not every song reaches the spiritual high of that moment, but when the notes of Let Us Dance fall like glass pebbles, or his voice expands once again, this music is impossible to resist. \u2022 At Yes, Manchester, 8 November, and touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
