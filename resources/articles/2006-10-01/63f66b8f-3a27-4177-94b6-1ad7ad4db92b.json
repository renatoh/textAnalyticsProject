Used by ancient Chinese warriors in psychological warfare, large kites with ghostly faces were flown above enemy positions before battle to upset the troops. And kites are currently banned in one of the most dangerous countries in the world, Pakistan, where you can buy a Kalashnikov for $100 in a street market, but flying a kite is considered too risky. Several people have been killed flying kites with glass- or razor-coated strings, where the objective is to cut the string of the opponent's kite, though passing cyclists' throats often get in the way. In Japan, enormous kites are flown, requiring up to 50 people to handle them, but mustering that many neighbours and friends every time you want to fly it can be a bit of a drag. Far better to make something simple for you and the children that can be finished and flying in an afternoon. You will need Doweling, fine bamboo or garden stakes, 90cm lengths Large piece of paper, ideally 1oocm x 75cm (disposable paper tablecloth available from the party aisle of a MegaMarket near you) Paper glue; in a liquid, and/or spray-mount Blob of wood glue Scotch tape, or better, brightly coloured gaffer tape Decorative materials Lots of string Step One Cut your sticks into two pieces, one slightly shorter than the other. Make a cross with the sticks as shown, by placing the shorter stick across the longer one about two thirds of the way along its length. Cut little notches at the intersection so that they don't slide about, and fix in position with wood glue and a bit of string binding, which children can help with. Next cut some notches in the four ends of your kite frame, and stretch some string between them to create that well-known diamond shape. Children can help by holding it in the grooves while you tighten it and tie it off. Make a loop at the top and tail end. Step Two It is often easier to decorate your kite before the paper goes on, so cut out a diamond about 3cm bigger than your kite frame, supply paints and crayons, and stand well back as the little ones conjure the scowling dragon face of their choice. When everything is dry, fold and glue carefully over the frame, as tight as you dare. Cut another piece of string about a quarter as long again as the longest strut of the kite, and tie it between the two loops on the frame, then tie another loop roughly opposite the intersection of the cross members. This is the kite's bridle (woah there, boy), which is where the string for the flying line is attached. You can make a tail by tying small ribbons or feathers, which children enjoy doing, though if you are planning any psy ops against your neighbours this can diminish the sinister effect."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
