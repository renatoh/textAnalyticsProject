Theatres, museums, orchestras and music venues were on Monday finally being told what they will receive from the government\u2019s \u00a31.57bn cultural recovery fund. The \u00a3257m lifeline is for organisations which applied for less than \u00a31m. It will, ministers said, allow performances to restart and enable venues to plan for reopening. For example the Finborough theatre in London will receive \u00a359,574 to help \u201cmaintain in-house skills to be able to reopen successfully in the future.\u201d It is a tiny venue, a room above a pub in Earl\u2019s Court, but has always punched way above its weight with alumni who include Rachel Weisz, Kathy Burke and Rory Bremner. It helped launch the career of playwright James Graham who, over the summer, campaigned passionately on the need for a culture rescue package. Graham, who wrote This House, Quiz and Brexit: the Uncivil War said: \u201cIt\u2019s such a relief to see these significant funds now reaching organisations who want to begin making work for their communities to enjoy. \u201cIt\u2019s also important that these theatres are spread nationwide, are big and small, and include venues like the Finborough which is where I cut my teeth and I wouldn\u2019t be a playwright or screenwriter without it.\u201d Other recipients include: \u2022 The Hall\u00e9 Orchestra in Manchester which receives \u00a3740,000 to help it live stream fortnightly concerts from the Bridgewater Hall. \u2022 The Cavern club, one of Liverpool\u2019s top tourist attractions forever linked to the Beatles, gets \u00a3525,000 to fund the recording of local musicians\u2019 live performances which will then be streamed online. \u2022 The Young Vic in London gets \u00a3961,455 to help it partially reopen between October and March, as well as remotely operate its directors programme and outreach work. \u2022 Theatre by the Lake in Keswick, Cumbria, receives \u00a3878,492 to help cover losses made as a result of coronavirus. \u2022 Birmingham Royal Ballet, led by Carlos Acosta, gets \u00a3500,000 to help offset losses from cancelled performances and touring. \u2022 Yorkshire Sculpture Park near Wakefield, has been awarded \u00a3804,013 to help it adapt its buildings to new regulations and continue to reopen safely. \u2022 The Hackney Empire in east London receives \u00a3585,064 to help support \u201ca new model of responsive programming\u201d and address increased costs because of the pandemic. \u2022 Bristol Old Vic, the oldest continuous working theatre in the English language where Olivia Colman and Daniel Day-Lewis began their careers, gets \u00a3610,466 to help transform its business model and support its creative workforce. Other recipients include the Wigmore Hall in London, which gets \u00a31m to help sustain its future; the London Symphony Orchestra, with \u00a3846,000 to help a phased return to full-scale performance; and Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, with \u00a3748,000 to allow it to provide a short, physically distanced programme, all of which will be recorded and later streamed. The money is from the Treasury but distributed by Arts Council England. Sir Nicholas Serota, the latter\u2019s chair, said: \u201cTheatres, museums, galleries, dance companies and music venues bring joy to people and life to our cities, towns and villages. \u201cThis is a difficult time for us all, but this first round of funding from the culture recovery fund will help sustain hundreds of cultural spaces and organisations that are loved and admired by local communities and international audiences.\u201d The money is directly aimed at organisations rather than the vast army of freelancers who keep arts organisations going. Last week hundreds of freelance musicians played outside parliament to highlight the plight of self-employed artists. The government argues that reopening venues creates work for those freelancers. The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden said: \u201cThis funding is a vital boost for the theatres, music venues, museums and cultural organisations that form the soul of our nation. It will protect these special places, save jobs and help the culture sector\u2019s recovery.\u201d The arts announcement follows \u00a3103m of rescue money to heritage organisations, announced last Friday. Arts organisations who applied for between \u00a31m and \u00a33m are still anxiously waiting to hear about their applications. Details of a \u00a3270m fund of loans, which will be given to larger arts organisations, has also yet to be announced. \u2022 The headline on this article was amended on 12 October 2020 to correct the figure to \u00a3257m, as stated in the article, not \u00a3275m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
