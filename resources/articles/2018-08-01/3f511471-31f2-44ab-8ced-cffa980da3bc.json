The news was announced during Clive Davis\u2019 pre-Grammy party in January.

I want to begin today by expressing my condolences to the family of a person I knew well. She worked for me on numerous occasions. She was terrific \u2014 Aretha Franklin \u2014 on her passing. She brought joy to millions of lives and her extraordinary legacy will thrive and inspire many generations to come. She was given a great gift from God \u2014 her voice, and she used to well. People loved Aretha. She was a special woman.

Her legacy will continue to inspire and resonate in the souls of Detroiters and her fans around the world. Motown Museum joins the rest of the world in mourning her passing as we celebrate her remarkable life and trailblazing contributions to music.\u201d Lauryn Hill, who produced and appeared on Franklin\u2019s 1998 single A Rose is Still a Rose, has paid tribute on Twitter, praising her \u201canointed gifts\u201d You can see the video for their track here: Lin-Manuel Miranda has shared a video of Franklin on Twitter of the one time he saw her sing live. It\u2019s undoubtedly worth a rewatch: Elizabeth Warren has also praised the singer for inspiring others to speak out and be heard After the classy statement from the Obamas, Trump has added in a presser that Franklin was someone who \u201cworked for him\u201d Kelly Clarkson has said that Franklin is the reason why she sings the way she sings and that there will never be someone like her. Clarkson covered her on American Idol back when she was a contestant. Martha Stewart has praised the singer for how \u201clovely\u201d she always was when she appeared on her show. And here\u2019s footage of Franklin performing at Obama\u2019s inauguration: In a finely constructed statement, the Obamas have paid tribute to Franklin\u2019s immense talent and range. Franklin performed at a number of events for the couple, including Obama\u2019s inauguration and the Labor Day rally. America has no royalty. But we do have a chance to earn something more enduring. Born in Memphis and raised in Detroit, Aretha Franklin grew up performing gospel songs in her father\u2019s congregation. For more than six decades since, every time she sang, we were all graced with a glimpse of the divine. Through her compositions and unmatched musicianship, Aretha helped define the American experience. In her voice, we could feel our history, all of it and in every shade \u2014 our power and our pain, our darkness and our light, our quest for redemption and our hard-won respect. She helped us feel more connected to each other, more hopeful, more human. And sometimes she helped us just forget about everything else and dance. Aretha may have passed on to a better place, but the gift of her music remains to inspire us all. May the Queen of Soul rest in eternal peace. Michelle and I send our prayers and warmest sympathies to her family and all those moved by her song. Quincy Jones, who worked with Franklin on her 1973 album Hey Now Hey (The Other Side of the Sky) has also released a statement: From the time that Dinah Washington first told me that Aretha was the \u2018next one\u2019 when she was 12 years old until the present day, Aretha Franklin set the bar upon which every female singer has and will be measured. And she did it with the professionalism, class, grace and humility that only a true Queen could. I treasured every moment that we spent together, from working in the recording studio to performing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial or simply hanging in the kitchen, and I will miss her dearly. R.I.P. Ree-Ree. You will reign as the Queen forever. Tony Bennett has reminisced about singing with Franklin on his 85th birthday; Missy Elliott has shared a video of Franklin on Twitter and praised her \u201cLEGENDARY TIMELESS\u201d music Gloria Estefan has also sent us this tribute: For as long as I can remember, Aretha Franklin has been the absolute zenith, the guiding light, the master for any girl that aspired to sing or even just appreciated someone at the top of their game. I was blessed to have sung with her on more than one occasion and each time I felt that I was in the presence of musical royalty that would forever raise the bar and set the standard. Long live the Queen of Soul through her extraordinary &amp; singular voice and her indelible music.\u201d We now also have a statement from Sony Music: Aretha Franklin was one of the most iconic voices in music history and a brilliant artist. Over the course of her decades-long career, which included many years with the Sony Music family, she inspired countless musicians and fans, and created a legacy that paved the way for a long line of strong female artists. Sony Music joins the world in mourning her passing. Timberlake\u2019s fellow ex-Mouseketeer Britney Spears has also paid tribute. Last year the singer posted a cover of Respect on Twitter with help from a high-pitch filter Justin Timberlake has tweeted about his sadness, reminding fans that he sang with Franklin way back when: After her father paid tribute, Ivanka Trump has now shared her feelings on the death of a \u201ctrailblazer\u201d leading to plenty of snarky, politically charged comments underneath ... We briefly mentioned it before, but can we just rejoice in how Aretha takes off coats better than anyone across history? In another lump-in-throat moment, Nasa have pointed out that the asteroid they named after Aretha is still orbiting on. Willie Nelson here, praising the way Franklin\u2019s voice cut across genre lines. Ava DuVernay, the film director behind civil rights biopic Selma, has quoted A Natural Woman and complimented Franklin\u2019s \u201cswagger\u201d. Don Cheadle meanwhile has this lovely three-part story: Well, we were slightly squeamishly waiting for this one, but Donald Trump\u2019s tweet in tribute is dignified \u2013 even if it lacks even 1% of her musicality. \u201cThis is so good I could kiss David Bowie! I mean that in a beautiful way, because we did.\u201d If you can endure the wrench, check out this footage of David Bowie presenting one of Aretha\u2019s 18 Grammy awards to her. Jeremy Corbyn has also highlighted the work Franklin did in civil rights and feminism, calling her music \u201cmoving and full of hope\u201d. Craig Charles, the UK\u2019s unofficial ambassador for funk and soul, is trying to get through a radio show right now: For more incredible photos, our picture editors have brought together this stunningly comprehensive gallery that spans the whole of her performing life \u2013 which, of course, was almost the whole of her life itself. Lenny Kravitz has shared a beautiful photo of him with Aretha, who looks suitably queenly: Barry Jenkins, whose film Moonlight won the Oscar for best film in 2016, used Aretha Franklin\u2019s One Step Ahead to poignant effect in it. He has written: Franklin\u2019s appeal of course cut right across the musical spectrum, and a whole host of different artists have been paying their Respects, beginning with country megastars Jason Isbell and Margo Price: Christina Aguilera\u2019s earnest yet blowsy delivery absolutely has its roots in Franklin\u2019s, and doesn\u2019t she know it: Chance the Rapper has quoted an Aretha classic: And Arcade Fire\u2019s Win Butler was playing her songs earlier this week: Bill Clinton, at whose 1993 inauguration gala Franklin performed, had earlier on this week encouraged people to \u201clift her up by listening and sharing her songs that have meant the most to you\u201d. He and Hillary Clinton have shared a statement. She will forever be the Queen of Soul and so much more to all who knew her personally and through her music. Our hearts go out to her family and her countless fans. Hillary wrote in a tweet that she was \u201cmourning the loss today of Aretha Franklin who shared her spirit and talent with the world. She deserves not only our RESPECT but also our lasting gratitude for opening our eyes, ears and hearts. Rest in eternal peace, my friend.\u201d One of the last people to see Franklin before she died was a fellow icon of the church and of civil rights activism, the Reverend Jesse Jackson \u2013 he, along with Stevie Wonder and Franklin\u2019s ex-husband Glynn Turman, visited her home earlier this week. In the wake of her death, he has written: In another tweet he added: \u201cWe will always love you. All hail to the Queen!\u201d And talking of Respect and Sisters Doin\u2019 It For Themselves, let\u2019s not forget this utterly masterful bit of shade that Aretha threw at Liz Smith: In many ways, one of Aretha\u2019s key recordings was her duet with Eurythmics, Sisters Are Doin\u2019 It For Themselves \u2013 her career was in a bit of a lull after some tepidly-received disco work, but it came bursting back after she took her gospel energy and fused it to big 80s pop. Annie Lennox, who of course sang alongside Franklin on the track, has posted a tribute to her website. As the One and Only \u2018Queen of Soul\u2019 Aretha Franklin was simply peerless. She has reigned supreme, and will always be held in the highest firmament of stars as the most exceptional vocalist, performer and recording artist the world has ever been privileged to witness. Superlatives are often used to describe astonishing singers. But in my view, even superlatives cannot be sufficient. Everyone who loved her will be saying little prayers of gratitude, respect and appreciation for the musical life force that enriched our lives. Her voice will soar forever. Paul McCartney, who was born just three months after Aretha, has posted this message: Elton John has posted a lengthy tribute on Instagram, saying in part: The loss of Aretha Franklin is a blow for everybody who loves real music: Music from the heart, the soul and the Church. Her voice was unique, her piano playing underrated \u2013 she was one of my favourite pianists. Her final live performance in public was at a gala event for the Elton John Aids Foundation in November 2017. She had announced a sort-of retirement, saying she would just focus on recording, but then \u2013 in typically indomitable fashion \u2013 turned round straight away and said \u201cI\u2019m not going to go anywhere and just sit down and do nothing. That wouldn\u2019t be good either.\u201d Sure enough, she was planning a couple of concerts as recently as April, but had to cancel them on doctor\u2019s orders. Actor Sally Field has written one of the most simple and affecting tributes yet. *reaches for Kleenex* Vying with the Natural Woman performance posted below in the great late period Aretha Franklin live performances, is this one that showrunner Shonda Rimes has pointed out: Idina Menzel has described Franklin as \u201cmy idol. The greatest singer of all time. Every note you sang was pure and authentic and pierced our hearts with joy and pain and life\u201d, while fellow stage star Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote: Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has also paid tribute to her civil rights record, as well as her fight for women\u2019s rights. Her song Respect alone has perhaps done more than almost any other song in terms of advancing feminism, taking Otis Redding\u2019s original and gender-flipping it so that Aretha is the one demanding respect \u2013 and some cash while you\u2019re at it. Planned Parenthood underlines the point: The Recording Academy have released a statement. Aretha did quite well out of them down the years \u2013 she won 18 Grammy awards, including the first eight years in a row of the best female R&amp;B vocal performance category. Carole King, who wrote (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman for Franklin, has paid her respects. If you haven\u2019t seen Aretha\u2019s performance of the above song at the Kennedy Center Honors event honouring Carole King, it is a document of a woman still at the peak of her emotional powers. And who, in the twilight of her career, could get a standing ovation at the drop of a fur coat. Obama was in tears, and so will you be. Barbra Streisand has described it as \u201cdifficult to conceive of a world without her\u201d, and highlighted her record on civil rights. Franklin sang at Martin Luther King\u2019s funeral, for example, and just days after it recorded the bracing Think. Tributes have started to come in from Franklin\u2019s fellow musicians. John Legend, with whom she collaborated on What Y\u2019All Came to Do in 2007 \u2013 one of the many examples of how Franklin refused to be a bland nostalgia act \u2013 was one of the first. Our writer Dorian Lynskey has penned a far-reaching tribute to Franklin, examining her life and art: \u201cSome artists, such as James Brown, set out to start a musical revolution. Aretha became a revolution by incarnating powerful ideas and desires that were sloshing around seeking a vessel strong enough to contain them.\u201d Music fans across the world are mourning the loss of Aretha Franklin, who has died aged 76. She had battled with ill-health since 2010, though had continued to perform until last November. Beginning her career in her early teens, she created a body of work that ranks as some of the most heartrending and spiritually uplifting popular music ever recorded. We\u2019ll be following reactions and tributes being paid to Franklin, as well as any updates on the circumstances of her death."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
