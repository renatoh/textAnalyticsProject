The move was a bold one for Democrats, who finally refused to be squeezed into compliance with the White House, but less may have changed than you might think as a result. As soon as it became clear that securing congressional approval for a series of draconian espionage policies wasn't going to be as easy as they'd expected, Republicans kicked off a brash but predictable campaign to convince Americans that the Democrats were endangering the country's security, at times even suggesting that their intransigence stemmed from their commitment to the welfare of trial lawyers (presumably the very trial lawyers who will make a killing from civil lawsuits against telecommunications companies who helped the government illegally spy on Americans). There was just one problem with this campaign, and that is that every single element of it was untrue. The White House claimed that securing immunity for telecoms was crucial, because without it, those companies may refuse to participate in any surveillance going forward, even legal surveillance. Never mind, of course, that those very companies can be compelled to assist the government when the surveillance has been court sanctioned. Never mind that, within days of the Democrats' decision to allow the Protect America Act expire, the administration confessed that, indeed, the telecoms themselves had agreed to continue working with the government. And never mind the fact that the telecom lawsuits are being waged by non-profit advocates like the American Civil Liberties Union and not trial lawyers. People like US attorney-general Michael Mukasey and director of national intelligence Mike McConnell alleged that crucial intelligence would be lost without something (preferably Orwellian) to replace the Protect America Act. Again, never mind that the act itself allows surveillance approved during its six-month existence to continue unabated for a year. And never mind the fact that the PAA did little to facilitate the very surveillance, supposedly at risk, to begin with. All of it was approvable by the rubber-stamp Fisa court, and much of it could be approved retroactively. It's impossible to say what went wrong for Republicans, accustomed as they are to winning every national security fight they wage against glass-jawed Democrats. Maybe it was all the lying. Or maybe it was the complexity of the issue. Or maybe it was a sign that the American public is genuinely suspicious of such broad power in the hands of the government. Either way, the campaign went nowhere. Democrats suffered precisely zero political setbacks, and may have even strengthened their hand for the upcoming elections. They earned, for their steadfastness, high praise from editorial pages across the country. Even the Washington Times - perhaps the nation's most loyally conservative daily - was forced to report that the administration's bluster was simply that. So, after rope-a-doping the opposition for two weeks, how do you suppose the Democrats plan to close out the fight? Well, if this article, this article, this article and this article are to be believed, then their plan is to figure out new, less obvious ways of kindly acquiescing to the very people who just spent two weeks ineffectively lying about them. As a matter of disclosure, I've heard varying accounts from Capitol Hill sources, some of whom say that yet another caving is likely, others of whom say don't count on it. But that's quite a bit of reporting, including fairly straightforward words from the senior Democrats heading the process, to just assume away. House Intelligence Committee chairman Silvestre Reyes has suggested that the Democrats might separate the immunity provision and the espionage provisions in the Senate Fisa package and hold votes on each of them. If that proves to be the plan, both will pass and it will be worse, at least symbolically, than if the Democrats had just folded forthwith as they have in the past. This was an easy fight compared with the fight to end the Iraq mess that they largely chose to avoid. If Democrats had taken that fight to its extreme and withheld war funds from the administration, the political fallout would have been much more radioactive, and it's genuinely hard to say in hindsight whether the Democrats would (or could) have won. But, on Fisa, the evidence is in. The public is on their side. The media is on their side. Their base is on their side. Their opponents seem desperate. And if they nonetheless decide they can't win, one might cynically conclude that, deep down, Democrats enjoy the thought of unchecked government surveillance authority as much as Republicans do. More likely, though, they will be signalling that, despite seven years of hard knocks, they haven't learned to speak as a party about national security with anything resembling confidence or principle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
