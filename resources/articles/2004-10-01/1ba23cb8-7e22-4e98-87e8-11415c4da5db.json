It is not difficult to assemble reasons for such a belief. Top of the list, if only because of its great symbolism, is Tony Blair's health. A heart treatment, the second within a year, is a powerful reminder of human and political mortality alike. The prime minister's purchase of a retirement home underscores the same point - a material glimpse of a political future that is Blairless. Mr Blair's revelation that he will indeed be gone by the general election of 2009 only rocks the political temple still further. It makes him already a lame duck leader in some eyes, and it conjures the prospect of four and a half years continuous speculation over who will succeed him. All this has occurred against the backdrop of a tense and difficult Labour conference week, to the unending descant of the Blair-Brown manoeuvring, and in the light of a Hartlepool byelection in which one in every three people who voted Labour in 2001 deserted the party on Thursday. Yet through all the uncertainty and all the instability, something different may have begun to take shape this week. That something is the gradual and growing possibility that the Labour party led by Tony Blair is unifying in the run-up to a 2005 general election which it has always seemed likely to win. There are two ways of looking at the week's events: one emphasises the motors of flux, the other registers a belief that Labour is slowly regaining some balance. Looked at in the latter way, Labour has had a reasonably successful conference, in which Mr Blair's changes of focus and tone, limited though they were, effectively calmed some of his critics, especially in the unions, and generated some useful new policies and momentum. That was only partly undermined by a Hartlepool win that, while no great triumph, was nevertheless a narrow victory for a government that is not doing brilliantly in the opinion polls. If you accept that neither Mr Blair's health nor his house purchase signals imminent change at the top (which, it must be said, many don't), then both he and the Labour party may be slowly emerging from the traumas of the last three years towards a more credible election fighting position. Many erstwhile supporters are unconvinced by this. For them, the jury is still out. If Hartlepool is not to prove a pyrrhic Labour victory, as a comparable win in Darlington was a generation ago, then the better signals from the party conference this week - including Mr Blair's halting efforts at dialogue over Iraq, the attempts to re-energise the domestic policy programme, the impulse for unity, compromise and mutual respect - need to be strengthened and carried forward more boldly. If that does not happen, then the surge to the Liberal Democrats that came close to capturing the seat will continue, and not just in Hartlepool. The very worst lessons that Labour could draw from the byelection are that it can ease up on its slow re-engagement with its supporters, or that a third general election victory is now almost in the bag. It is true that Ukip's third place in Hartlepool, and the extraordinarily poor Conservative showing, point to the possibility of a more general electoral alignment on the right that, because of the first-past-the-post system, could be incredibly favourable for Labour in the general election. But if Labour is to deserve to win again in 2005, it must win on the merits of its own programme, its own principles and its own leaders, not on the basis of the squabbling on the right. The electorate may be slowly coming round to the idea of a third term, but Labour this week has only just begun to make the case. This is the moment to redouble those efforts, not to relax them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
