It said UK house prices rose by 0.7% last month - little more than half the 1.3% rise notched up in September. But Nationwide added: \"The underlying trend in house prices is still firm.\" The data came as official government figures for September released yesterday provided more evidence that the buoyant London housing market is leaving many other regions trailing in its wake. Prices in London jumped 2% in September, with the average price tag now \u00a3306,124. Nationwide said the average price of a UK home stood at \u00a3169,623 - some \u00a312,500 more than this time last year. The annual rate of increase is running at 8%. However, worsening affordability and expected increases in interest rates will affect homebuyers and property investors, said Fionnuala Earley, Nationwide's group economist. Whereas house prices are at an all-time high, the stock market has only just returned to 2000 levels, and some investors may take the view that the potential for growth in the stock market is rosier than in the housing market. \"At the margins this could encourage some investors to begin to switch their preferences towards equities,\" said Ms Earley. The Land Registry, a government department, yesterday published its first monthly house price index. It said the average property price in England and Wales rose by a \"strong\" 1.3% in September to stand at \u00a3169,569. Camden and Kensington and Chelsea enjoyed annual price growth in excess of 14%, but most regions saw prices rise by less than 1%, and in north-east England they fell by 2%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
