The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) took over regulation of the credit market in April and began a crackdown on payday loan companies and other high-cost lenders. Which? said it had found evidence of poor practice elsewhere in the sector that made it difficult for consumers to manage their borrowing and shop around. The consumer group called for a series of actions to tackle the problems, including: capping default fees on all credit products; cracking down on irresponsible lending by withholding authorisation for firms found to have business models that rely on customers defaulting; and banning firms for advertising 0% deals if there was an upfront cost. It said lenders should be required to do \"quotation\" searches on would-be borrowers so that they were not penalised for shopping around. Applying to several providers can damage a consumer's credit record and make it harder or more expensive for them to borrow. Among the unfair and irresponsible lending practices Which? outlined were retailers automatically setting up credit accounts when a card payment is declined, and \"buy now pay later\" deals offered by catalogue companies that punish consumers for small changes in their repayment behaviour. The executive director of Which?, Richard Lloyd, said: \"The regulator has so far rightly focused on the unscrupulous practices of payday lenders, however, we have found problems across the whole of the credit market. \"It's now more important than ever that all credit products are up to scratch, so that consumers can more easily manage their borrowing.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
