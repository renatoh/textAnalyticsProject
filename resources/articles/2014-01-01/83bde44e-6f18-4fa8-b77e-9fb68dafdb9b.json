It\u2019s something akin to watching a mature One Direction with card tricks and a buzz-saw. The four magicians have their own specialities, which means there is a little personalised variety on offer from the tricks at play. Staniforth is a magician in the Derren Brown tradition, working mostly with found objects and the power of suggestion to gobsmack audiences at his apparent ability to read their minds. Flom, who comes across as something of a college geek, is a more traditional magician in the \"ooh, watch the chair, now it's floating, ooh\" school. Galea's act of card tricks and shell games has the vibrancy of something that hovers between stage magic and a money-on-the-table hustle, while Willman \u2013 like some kind of variety Voltron \u2013 combines the talents of the other three with a level of comic flair that marks him out, deliberately or not, as the leader of the pack. The comparisons to One Direction do not, as a result, end with the combination of not unattractive men on stage goofing around in the cause of popular (and commercial) entertainment. Watching the show \u2013 which combines one or two group routines amidst a progression of solo sets \u2013 it becomes impossible to not pick favourites. To my mind, Willman and Galea are the real showmen, combining rapid patter with spitfire-quick magic routines, while Flom and Staniforth pepper their slower set-ups with the \"check this out\" and \"look at this, so gross\" MTV generation naffery. It seems to leave the show a little lopsided, but it could be personal preferences affecting the ballast. No expense has been spared with props, emotionally manipulative show tunes and a light show that reminds us of a staged AC/DC retrospective. The schmaltz is dialled up to 11 with old-style piano accompaniment and monologues about childhood dreams, but video cameras are also used around traditional sleight-of-hand and one routine is stage-directed by Siri from an iPhone. Running at 140 minutes, Band of Magicians was way too long for this impatient reviewer, but the audience appreciated the bang for their buck \u2013 a standing ovation and a packed house are testament to that. Band of Magicians plays until 19 January. Tickets $50/$65"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
