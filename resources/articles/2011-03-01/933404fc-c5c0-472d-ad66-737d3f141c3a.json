A competitive rivalry forged over 40 years ago across the Glasgow divide ensures there will be no repeat of Roy Hodgson's mistakes with Kenny Dalglish in charge. It is only eight weeks since Dalglish returned to Anfield but Liverpool differ as greatly as his own preparations for the two meetings with Manchester United in that period. On the eve of the first, the FA Cup third-round exit at Old Trafford, the Scot disembarked from a cruise and a carefree life having answered the managerial call he had waited 20 years to receive. This time he has spent his 60th birthday on the training ground at Melwood plotting how to spoil United's pursuit of a 19th league championship. The transformation brings no complaints. Style of play \u2013 \"We wanted it to be more positive, a 'pass and move' philosophy,\" Henry has said, illustrating the American owners' intention to restore Anfield traditions \u2013 the atmosphere around a fractured club and, first and foremost, results have all enabled Liverpool to walk on swiftly from the mess created by Tom Hicks and George Gillett that engulfed Rafael Ben\u00edtez and Hodgson. In Dalglish Liverpool have rediscovered a manager who unites owners, players and fans alike. Hodgson never convinced as a Liverpool manager on or off the pitch and his dealings with Ferguson only deepened the Kop's dismay. Labelling him \"the greatest manager of my generation, certainly within English football\" may have reflected the former Fulham manager's honesty and civility but there are some things a Liverpool manager should leave unsaid. Refusing to take the United manager to task when he accused Fernando Torres of attempting to get John O'Shea sent off compounded the suspicion that Liverpool's leader was treating the Old Trafford enemy with a respect bordering on reverence. There will be no ground given by Dalglish. \"Sometimes you think that the ones who shout loudest are the ones who get the more beneficial decisions and that would be totally unfair,\" the Liverpool manager says. Conscious that Ferguson was facing a Football Association charge for questioning the referee Martin Atkinson's integrity following United's defeat at Chelsea, Dalglish refused to identify particulars. But he did confirm that events of the past week had provoked his resentment and he began his criticism with an assessment of Howard Webb's handling of Liverpool's FA Cup defeat at United in January. \"The players gave a good account of themselves at Old Trafford in the Cup tie. They lost a penalty that was a poor penalty decision in the first minute and then Stevie [Gerrard] got sent off. That didn't help us. \"We will respect the [Respect] campaign as long as we think that we won't be suffering in any way, shape or form. Right at this particular moment in time I cannot say that it is particularly true that we haven't suffered. But we will try our best to maintain our dignity and respect for referees but we would also like to think they would show us respect for going along with the guidelines of the campaign.\" From his first day back in charge Dalglish has talked up Liverpool's ambitions and players at every opportunity while deflecting praise for his application to succeed Hodgson on a permanent basis. The squad have enthusiastically received the appointment of Steve Clarke as first-team coach \u2013 the departure of the already disaffected Torres notwithstanding \u2013 and Dalglish says confidence, not an improved pressing and passing game, explains why a different proposition awaits Ferguson at Anfield. \"The players have probably got more belief about themselves now than they had then,\" Dalglish says. \"I know we lost at Old Trafford and then lost to Blackpool and are now coming off the back of the West Ham defeat but overall the players are more confident and have more belief in what they are doing. Sometimes when there is a change you get a wee lift for a short spell but the longer that spell lasts for the better it will be for everybody.\" Defeat at West Ham last Sunday provided a sobering reminder to Liverpool that the deficiencies in their squad \u2013 exacerbated by recent injuries \u2013 will not be remedied simply by the arrival of a popular manager. He does, however, expect a well-timed response against United. \"West Ham is not a game we can dismiss from the memory,\" Dalglish says. \"We will learn from it, hopefully, in the games to come.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
