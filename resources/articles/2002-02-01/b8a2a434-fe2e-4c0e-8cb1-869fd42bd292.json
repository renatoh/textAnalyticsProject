Not for this New Zealander the soubriquet Great Redeemer. Which is just as well as the Vatican might not have taken kindly to claims of God-given powers across Rome at the Stadio Flaminio. So, while Graham Henry goes home somewhat richer but mainly poorer for his experience as Wales' coach, Johnstone is able to survive a run of 10 successive defeats since the Azzurri won their first game as Six Nations newcomers when they beat Scotland 34-20 in Rome two long years ago. For most non-Scots hope springs eternal that this afternoon Italy can repeat that astonishing result of 2000. The opening of the championship, Ireland's vibrant display in Dublin apart, had a predictable air about it and it is no fun if a side go into games with damage limitation in mind. A fortnight ago Italy seemed concerned only with keeping the score down in France, a cynical display which also saw four of their players sent to the sin-bin. Losing matches is one thing, losing friends another. \"Maybe,\" said Italy's scrum-half Alessandro Troncon, \"we didn't show the sparkling rugby everyone expected from us but we are only just starting out. We concentrated on defence and we have a lot more to work on to be effective. We know we have a great opportunity against Scotland to wipe out all the criticism we had after the Paris game.\" He may have added that Italy also have a chance of winning. They might not have created much in the way of scoring opportunities against France but then neither did the Scots against England. To help rectify this Ian McGeechan, the Scotland coach, has restored Gregor Townsend, the one player behind the scrum to show any cutting edge against England, to his favoured No10 role. Duncan Hodge, whose kicking against England would have given the fly-half nightmares had he been able to sleep since, is dropped to the bench and there is a first start, at centre, for Glasgow's Andrew Henderson. Johnstone, with the former All Black John Kirwan as his assistant and another New Zealander Mark Graham working on defence, knows that the Italians can be competitive at the scrum. Rather surprisingly he has dropped Andrea lo Cicero to the bench while Gloucester's Federico Pucciariello comes in at loose-head. Townsend has helped Castres to the semi-finals of the Heineken Cup and will be relieved that the kicking duties have been handed to Chris Paterson who - under the tutelage of the new goalkicking coach Michael Burns, a recruit from Aussie Rules - is convinced he can give Italy's Diego Dominguez a run for his money. \"It's great to have someone keeping an eye on you and offering advice,\" Paterson said. \"Michael is trying to add to the good points and take away the bad. You can't just forget a missed kick. It's always in the back of your mind.\" Kenny Logan's missed kicks cost Scotland dear in Rome two years ago and he is on the bench along with Robbie Russell, the victim of Martin Johnson's uppercut last weekend. Scotland should win but penalties might be needed to separate two sides desperate to kick-start their championship season. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
