Under the proposals put forward by the diocesan synod, official Church of England services would be held after a couple has formed a civil partnership or married in a secular ceremony. The plans fall short of calling for same-sex wedding services to take place in church but priests would be allowed to offer a formal blessing to couples. The bishop of Hereford, the Rt Rev Richard Frith, said the motion was a response to requests from same-sex couples to perform the services informally. \u201cClergy are already encouraged to respond pastorally and sensitively when approached,\u201d he said. \u201cThe motion, which is part of a much wider debate, asks for guidance on materials to be used in affirming and praying with same-sex couples.\u201d Under the proposals, individual priests and churches would be allowed to opt out of the blessing services. The progressive OneBodyOneFaith group said it was delighted with the vote. \u201cSupport for such a motion in a predominantly rural diocese like Hereford reflects what many of our members and supporters know to be true \u2013 that in communities across the country, in all kinds of contexts, there is widespread support for affirming same-sex couples and being alongside them as they experience the joy and blessing of their relationships,\u201d it said in a statement. Some traditionalists have criticised the idea. Suzie Leafe, director of a conservative evangelical group Reform, told the BBC: \u201cMarriage [is] a lifelong relationship between a man and a woman and this has been \u2013 and still is \u2013 the understanding of the vast majority of the worldwide church for two millennia. To ask for a service of prayer and dedication for a same-sex relationship represents a fundamental departure from this teaching.\u201d A spokesperson for the Church of England said: \u201cThe diocesan synod\u2019s decision does not change the teaching or practice of the Church of England, whether in Hereford or anywhere else in the Church. \u201cClergy of the Church of England are unable to marry couples of the same sex and, under the House of Bishops\u2019 pastoral statement on same sex marriage, \u2018services of blessing\u2019 should not be provided for those who enter into civil partnerships or same-sex marriages. \u201cIt is recognised, however, that there is real and profound disagreement in the Church of England over questions relating to human sexuality and the House of Bishops has recently embarked on the preparation of a major new teaching document on marriage and sexuality.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
