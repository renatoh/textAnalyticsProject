Cambridgeshire officers were called to Lovell Road in the north of the city in the early hours of Sunday, after receiving reports that a sizeable snake had been spotted in the area. Officers tracked down its owners who confirmed the snake\u2019s length to be 2.7 metres (9ft). It remains at large, police confirm. The snake is a reticulated python, which can grow up to 9.6 metres (31.5ft), making them the largest of the Pythonidae family. Native to Asia, they are able to survive in urban and suburban areas in spite of their large size. They are non-venomous. Instead the animal uses its powerful bite to catch its prey \u2013 typically mammals and birds \u2013 usually followed by constriction, squeezing it tightly in the coils of its body. An RSPCA spokeswoman said that anyone who unexpectedly encounters a non-native snake should \u201ckeep a safe distance [and] monitor the snake\u201d before calling their helpline. The charity released figures in April revealing that it rescued more than 4,000 exotic pets last year. The RSPCA believes that the high number of incidents involving these pets could be due to inexperienced owners being misinformed on how to care for them, resulting in the animals escaping or being abandoned or neglected. An abandoned three-metre long boa constrictor found in the backseat of a Bristol car was among the 15,790 emergency callouts the RSPCA received across England and Wales in 2018. It also appears this is not the first time Cambridgeshire constabulary has dealt with snakes, after officers found a large corn snake in May. Suspected to be a lost pet, it was taken to a wildlife centre in Stretham. Police urge anyone who sees the missing python not to approach it, but to phone 101, the non-emergency number."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
