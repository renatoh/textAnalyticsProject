They've toughened up their sound with orchestral stabs and disembodied dance beats, but crafted some of their strongest tunes. The ghost of Public Image Limited's This Is Not a Love Song hovers on the juddering Mercury - ironic given recent scuffles. Other tracks are more fragile and beautiful. Intimacy's lyrics mostly document Kele Okoreke's 2007 relationship break-up with varying degrees of profundity, but it's hard not to be affected by the disturbingly lovely Biko, where the singer seems anguished that his love isn't strong enough to cure someone's cancer. Brave, individual and heartfelt, Intimacy offers treasure for fans old and new."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
