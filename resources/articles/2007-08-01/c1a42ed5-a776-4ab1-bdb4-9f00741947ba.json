He added nearly half a million listeners on the same period last year and is now only 660,000 behind Radio 2's Terry Wogan, who presents the country's most popular breakfast show with an audience of 7.92 million. By contrast, Radio 3 posted its lowest audience. The station, whose controller, Roger Wright, oversaw its biggest schedule change in five years in February, saw its audience drop 51,000 year on year to 1.78 million, its lowest level since new Rajar methodology was introduced 10 years ago. However, the second quarter is a traditionally weak one for the BBC station. Commercial radio closed the gap on the BBC but still lags 10.8% in terms of audience share. The BBC has a 54.3% share of the market - down from a record 56% in the first three months of the year - while commercial stations had a 43.5% share, up from 42.1%. Radio 4 slipped back from a record audience share at the start of 2007 but still added nearly 300,000 listeners year on year to 9.48 million. Both The Archers and the Today programme were down on the previous quarter but up year on year, with 4.71 million and 6.18 million respectively."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
