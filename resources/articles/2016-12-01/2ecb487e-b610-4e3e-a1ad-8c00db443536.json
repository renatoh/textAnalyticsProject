There\u2019s the sparkling wine versus champagne debate, heated opinions about the best temperature to serve it, long discussions to be had about the most advantageous shape of the glass in which it is served, how the cork must be eased from the bottle not with a pop but with a ladylike sigh, and all manner of curious \u201cdid you know?\u201d facts that bubble up at a table of wine aficionados. The fiddly riddling of the bottles, the legend of the accidental secondary fermentation that created the signature bubbles in the first place, the chalkiness of the terroir, the shape of Marie Antoinette\u2019s breast, and yada yada yada, everyone\u2019s an expert. Except, that is, for the four Guardian Australian writers who submitted to a blind tasting of six sparkling wines of varying price and provenance. In an effort to find their inner champagne snobs just in time for Christmas (and to work out what to buy), they were guided through the tasting by the actual-expert hand of sommelier Samantha Payne of Nomad Restaurant and Wine Store. As Payne says, when buying wines we are very guided by labels and prices, and the same labels and prices influence what we taste. So six wines were chosen with fairly loose parameters: two from Australia, two French (one from the supermarket chain Aldi), and one each from Italy and Spain. Ranging in price from $17 to $129, they were covered in foil so none of the guinea pigs could see what they were tasting or know how it would impact their bank balance. They had to rely on the senses of taste and smell only. Just like art, it was a matter of \u201cI don\u2019t know much, but I know what I like\u201d. And that\u2019s all that matters, right? Here are their tasting notes. Cheers. Wines sampled: 1. Santa Margherita Prosecco di Valdo, $20 (Italy) 2. Jacobs Creek Trilogy Cuvee Brut, $18 (Australia) 3. Freixenet Vintage 2013 Reserve Cava $17 (Spain) 4. Veuve Clicquot Vintage Gold 2004 $129 (France) 5. Pirie Sparkling non vintage $37 (Australia) 6. Monsigny NV Premier Cru $29.99 (France) Lenore Taylor\u2019s pick: Pirie, \u2018a lovely dry mouthful of bubbles\u2019 I come to champagne tasting with some set views. I don\u2019t love the most expensive French champagnes. I find their complex, slightly dusty flavours overwhelming. I like less fashionable dry, fruity sparkling wines that cost about half as much. Or at least that\u2019s what I tell myself when I know what\u2019s in my glass. But a blind tasting is the ultimate test. The first bubbly to pour from the anonymous foil-covered bottles is too sweet and acidic. It\u2019d be OK at a picnic, but it\u2019s not great. I give it three out of five. It turns out to be prosecco at $20 a bottle. I\u2019ve never been a huge prosecco fan. I don\u2019t like the second one at all. It\u2019s sweet and bland, a little bit Passion Pop. One out of five. Turns out to be the $17 Jacob\u2019s Creek Trilogy and for my not particularly sophisticated palate, you\u2019d be getting what you paid for. The third one has a bit of that dusty taste I associate with the champagnes I\u2019m slightly embarrassed not to love, but the fourth has that full complex French champagne flavour. I give them both a four. I figure they\u2019re both probably French. Actually, the third was Freixenet, at $18 a bottle, and the fourth is vintage Verve at $129 \u2013 so if, like me \u2013 you are obviously not a French champagne aficionado, the Freixenet is probably a bargain. Number six made my tongue curl. It was revealed to be a cheaper French champagne. My favourite was number five \u2013 a lovely dry mouthful of bubbles, simpler and more subtle than the Verve, fruity and citrusy and deliciously drinkable. Five out of five \u2013 my kind of sparkling. I\u2019ll be buying the $37 Pirie Tasmanian sparkling wine for Christmas. Gabrielle Jackson\u2019s pick: prosecco, \u2018perfect with prawn cocktails\u2019 My qualifications for tasting sparkling wine involve only having consumed quite a lot of it. When I moved to the UK in 2003 and discovered how much cheaper champagne was there than in Australia, I got quite carried away with the drinking of it. Later, after a trip to Italy, prosecco became my bubbly of choice and I could afford to buy it by the caseload \u2013 to serve as an Aperol spritz with a side of olives and lightly salted crisps. So I knew the prosecco when I tasted it, and at $20, the Santa Margherita Prosecco di Valdo is great value for money and a perfect accompaniment to our Christmas Day entree of prawn cocktails. If I were rich (I\u2019m not), I would have no hesitation in shelling out $129 for the vintage Veuve \u2013 as soon as I dipped my nose into the glass and inhaled the buttery aroma I knew I was on to a winner. I admired the very fine bubbles in the glass and the long aftertaste reminded me of the best chardonnays I\u2019ve tasted. It was hands-down my favourite of the six wines and I was not partaking in any of that spitting out nonsense, let me tell you. In fact, I asked for a second taste just to make sure it was my favourite. I had more trouble identifying the other wines but the Tasmanian Pirie was also lovely to drink and I could quite happily quaff it at a cocktail party. The fine bubbles tingled on my lips, which was rather pleasant. For me, the real surprise was the cava. At $17, the vintage Freixenet seems a steal. As for the Jacob\u2019s Creek, well, I might be happy to drink it at a pub at midnight, after I\u2019d been drinking since lunchtime, but otherwise pass me the sparkling water please. And the less said about the acidic Monsigny champagne from Aldi, the better. This Christmas, I\u2019ll be serving the prosecco with the starters and the Pirie sparkling will be filling the stockings of some people I love. Brigid Delaney\u2019s pick: Veuve, \u2018buttery and golden\u2019 The prosecco felt immediately very minerally and acidic \u2013 with dense bubbles and dry finish. It had me craving seafood \u2013 oily fish like salmon would could go well with something like this, that truly cuts through. The Jacob\u2019s Creek Trilogy Cuvee Brut \u2013 yuck \u2013 was like a Fruit Tingle lolly with too much sugar and a greasy aftertaste. It is one to have at the end of Christmas Day perhaps \u2013 after your booze stocks are depleted and your palate is tired. The Freixenet Vintage 2013 Reserve Cava was very drinkable and I could imagine being a good thirst quencher on a hot day. We stuck our noses to the glass as one of us said, \u201csmell the oak\u201d. It smelt like it was made from real fruit and in a barrel \u2013 as opposed to the Jacob\u2019s Creek, which tasted vaguely chemical. The Veuve was the best. It was buttery and golden, slightly acidic with an aftertaste that reminded me of chardonnay. Not only would this choice be great with Christmas lunch but it\u2019s the sort of drink that would work well all by itself, or with a side of strawberries. The Pirie sparkling from Tasmania was similar to the prosecco and tasted acidic enough to cut through the strongest Christmas flavours \u2013 brandy butter fruit pudding, slabs of seafood, creamy pavlova. By the sixth tasting I was beginning to feel as if I\u2019d eaten an entire roast turkey. This was a slightly sweeter blend that had a tart, almost vinegary aftertaste. My favourite \u2013 number four \u2013 was the most expensive, the Veuve Clicquot Vintage Gold 2004 (France) at $129 a pop. But if you want something more affordable, the Freixenet Vintage 2013 reserve Cava from Spain at $17 is good value. Steph Harmon\u2019s pick: prosecco, \u2018bubbles to refresh a mild hangover\u2019 I came into this tasting at the distinct disadvantage of having indulged in too much cheap sparkling at an event the night before. On the flipside, when the worst stuff touched my tongue it was like muscle memory: Jacob\u2019s Creek Trilogy Cuvee Brut is bad and should feel bad. When I\u2019m looking for a sparkling, I want something dry, citrusy, light and subtle \u2013 nothing challenging. I\u2019m looking for something to drink outside on a summer evening, with a seafood barbeque and a long night ahead. Nothing too sophisticated, but taste is taste. I really enjoyed the prosecco; it was dry and would cut through seafood, and \u2013 importantly \u2013 it was bubbly enough to refresh a mild hangover. Perfect for Boxing Day lunch. The Pirie sparkling was a favourite too \u2013 it was interesting without being overwhelming, but I found its aftertaste a little too sweet. (I picked its price point though, which brought me no small amount of smugness.) The cava was initially great, but got steadily worse the further down the glass I got, and when I went for a repour \u2013 in a tremendous show of collegial generosity, we brought the half-drunk bottles back to the office \u2013 it tasted kind of like garbage. I loved the depth and complexity of the Veuve, and was strangely satisfied to have picked the most expensive wine as my favourite. But if I were to shop for the booze next weekend, on taste and price the prosecco would be my pick.
