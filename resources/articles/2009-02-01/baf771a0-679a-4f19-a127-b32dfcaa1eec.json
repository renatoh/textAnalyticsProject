Coventry City will be at full strength and the Championship side proved last night they are more than capable of exploiting any team in which unfamiliarity is a factor, however talented the individuals may be. Or may claim to be. Not one of Sam Allardyce's team last night started against Manchester United on Saturday, although the fact the Rovers manager could include Chris Samba, Benni McCarthy, Tugay Kerimoglu and Jason Roberts spoke volumes about the difference between these clubs in terms of strength in depth. As Allardyce pointed out afterwards, that core of experience should have been enough. Indeed, Blackburn should have been ahead within a minute. Ben Turner's hesitancy allowed Carlos Villanueva to run clear in the Coventry penalty area but his shot from an angle was low and the City goalkeeper Keiren Westwood beat the ball away. A goal that early would have bought the Premier League side breathing space that it looked increasingly as though they might need. Encouraged by their biggest crowd of the season - 22,793 - Coventry took the initiative and, when Elliott Ward met Danny Fox's corner on the six-yard line, they appeared certain to take the lead. The centre-half was not the only man to put his head in his hands when he guided his header wide. Ten minutes before the break, City had another wonderful chance when Clinton Morrison, poaching in the penalty area, nipped the ball away from Rovers' goalkeeper Jason Brown, only to turn his shot into the side-netting . Shortly before the hour, however, City got the goal their increasing share of possession deserved. A simple one it was, too, as Rovers left Leon Best unmarked to head home Henderson's cross from the right wing. \"Bizarre defending. It baffled me, to be honest,\" sighed Allardyce. He sent on Roque Santa Cruz but there were few signs that Blackburn were going to find a way back into the game until the very last minute of in jury-time, when Samba's header rolled inches past the post. \"You listen to players saying they should be in the team and you give them the opportunity to show they can play as well as they can talk,\" said Allardyce. \"They did in the first half but not in the second. I'd have loved to get to Wembley but I have to think ahead. In that respect three points against Hull on Sunday is much more important.\" His opposite number, Chris Coleman, said Coventry always felt they could capitalise on the fact that Rovers' priorities lay elsewhere. \"It's hard for Sam but it wasn't like they weren't bothered,' he said. \"Overall we deserved to win. It was the best night since I've been at the club.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
