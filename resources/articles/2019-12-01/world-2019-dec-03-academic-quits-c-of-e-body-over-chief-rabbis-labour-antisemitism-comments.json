Gus John, a respected author and academic, said: \u201cAs a matter of principle, I cannot continue to work with the Anglican church \u2026 after the archbishop of Canterbury\u2019s disgraceful endorsement of the chief rabbi\u2019s unjust condemnation of Jeremy Corbyn and the entire Labour party.\u201d Justin Welby backed the chief rabbi\u2019s unprecedented intervention, which in effect called on British Jews not to vote Labour in next week\u2019s election, because the way the party leadership had dealt with allegations of antisemitism was \u201cincompatible with the British values of which we are so proud \u2013 of dignity and respect for all people\u201d. Three days later, John wrote to Elizabeth Henry, the C of E\u2019s national adviser on minority ethnic issues, saying \u201cthose who occupy houses clad with stained glass should perhaps be a trifle more careful when they join others in throwing stones\u201d. He could no longer serve as a lay member of the church\u2019s committee for minority ethnic Anglican concerns, he added. The media had responded to the chief rabbi\u2019s criticism \u201cas if he were the pope, speaking for all British Jews as the pope would for all Roman Catholics. Secular Jews and those who do not hold with the views of Jews for Labour are considered not to matter\u201d. He said: \u201cNo one section of the population of this nation has a monopoly on oppression, pain and hurt,\u201d citing the unlawful detention, harassment and criminalisation of black and Asian people. \u201cWhat \u2018positive reassurance\u2019 is the archbishop of Canterbury insisting that political parties give the many thousands rendered vulnerable by the government\u2019s \u2018hostile\u2019 environment\u2019?\u201d The church\u2019s record on combating racism was \u201cno less woeful now than it was 30 years ago\u201d, John\u2019s letter said. \u201cBlack and global majority people in the church, whether as clergy, laity or employees are still experiencing discrimination and exclusion, benign and sugar-coated or otherwise, at every level of organisation in the church and yet, their active presence in communion with the church is responsible for its survival and buoyancy in many communities.\u201d In an accompanying statement, John said: \u201cWhat gives the archbishop of Canterbury the right to endorse the chief rabbi\u2019s scaremongering about Corbyn and adopt such a lofty moral position in defence of the Jewish population? I have often had cause to wonder how it is that Justin Welby was made archbishop of Canterbury, rather than John Sentamu [archbishop of York] \u2026 it was widely expected \u2013 in some circles at least \u2013 that Sentamu would get that post. Sentamu was a highly respected black senior cleric and had been a bishop since 1996 and archbishop of York since 2005.\u201d John added: \u201cIf Anglicans in the UK from the African and Asian diaspora were to judge Justin Welby as the leader of the established church by the same criteria he appears to be employing in his assessment of Jeremy Corbyn, he too would fail the fitness to lead test.\u201d Dr Elizabeth Henry, the Church of England\u2019s adviser on race and ethnicity, said: \u201cProf John made an immense contribution to the work of the committee for minority ethnic Anglican concerns and he will be greatly missed by the committee and the wider church. We wish him well for the future.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
