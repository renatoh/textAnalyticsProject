The schools white paper published last October clearly set out the strategic role of local authorities, stating that they would be able to \"intervene decisively in schools falling below expectations, including 'coasting' schools, by issuing warning notices and taking radical action where necessary\". This is not about taking over successful schools, but ensuring that all schools are doing their best for all their children and that decisive action is taken where that is demonstrably not the case. Any intervention by the local authority can take place only on the basis of firm, specific evidence and the guidance makes clear that there is a presumption that the new powers would apply primarily to schools in the bottom decile nationally on one or more key performance indicators. Furthermore, the guidance ensures that local authorities will not issue warning notices in cases where schools are already taking action, and responding to support and advice, to address underperformance. What the guidance does set out is the role of local authorities to provide quicker support to struggling schools. This includes powers to secure greater federation and collaboration between stronger and weaker schools. Many of these federations will be backed up by trusts - strengthening leadership and management of schools as well as bringing new energy, enthusiasm and the experience of an external organisation to raise standards. There is no contradiction between giving greater autonomy to successful schools while challenging and supporting those that are not doing well enough for their pupils. Bill Rammell MP Minister of state for education The government should accept the National Union of Teachers' proposal for local parents to have a vote on plans for trust schools in their area (Report, April 15). After all, it said in last autumn's school white paper that it wanted \"a school system shaped by parents\". The present reality appears very different. Policy ideas like trust schools, academies and the expansion of specialist schools seem to be dreamt up on the Downing Street sofa. They are then imposed on local communities. A radical change is needed to a much more open and inclusive style. Prof Ron Glatter Hemel Hempstead, Herts"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
