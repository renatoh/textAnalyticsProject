The Survivors Against Terror group \u2013 which includes the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox, the brother and mother of Manchester bombing victim Martyn Hett and the widow of fusilier Lee Rigby \u2013 argue that communities need to be better integrated and more inclusive. They have called for \u201cstrong support\u201d for the police and security services. Those involved include bereaved family members and seriously injured survivors caught up in attacks by the IRA, far-right activists and Islamist extremists. The lobby group will meet regularly and fight for effective policies for tackling terrorism, arguing that the scourge can be defeated only \u201cif we pull together as a country to fight it more effectively\u201d. Dan Hett and Figen Murray, the brother and mother of Manchester bombing victim Martyn Hett, are among the founding members, as is Paralympian and 7/7 survivor Martine Wiltshire and Tunisia resort shooting victim Gina Van Dort. The founders said they had mixed experiences of support from the government and other bodies. Some support was \u201cexemplary\u201d but others had been left with no help at all. They said: \u201cWe will be reaching out to other survivors and bereaved families to build a better picture of what is and isn\u2019t working, and will be talking to the government and other service providers about the gaps we identify.\u201d Other founding members include Travis Frain, who was hit by the car on Westminster Bridge, Mike Haines, whose brother David was beheaded on camera after being held captive by Islamic State, Yassin Hersi, who was injured in the Finsbury Park mosque attack and Jo Berry, whose father Sir Anthony Berry was killed by the IRA in the 1984 Brighton bombing. Brendan Cox, whose wife Jo was killed by a far-right extremist, said the group was aiming to educate the public about how they could help, including speaking to children in schools about their potential in the fight against hatred and mobilising support for the police and security services. \u201c[A]t its heart it will be trying to make sure that we don\u2019t just respond to terror but that we get ahead of it, defeat it at its core, at its source. That is one of the central missions of our work together,\u201d he said. The group will also seek to tackle hate speech and will demand social media companies and media outlets treat survivors with respect and accuracy. They have urged other survivors of terrorism to get in touch via the group\u2019s website. Dan Hett encouraged people to think about the continuing damage following an act of terrorism. \u201cWe as a group are quite diverse ethnically, politically, age-wise, what better way to illustrate that extremism and terrorism isn\u2019t picky about who it affects than having a cross-section of people who have been affected by it, who cover the spectrum of the UK\u2019s residents,\u201d he said. Amber Rudd praised the \u201ccourage and dedication\u201d of all those involved. \u201cTheir ambition to bring positive change as a response to their horrific experiences is inspiring,\u201d the home secretary said, adding that a Victims of Terrorism Unit had been set up last year to provide \u201ccomprehensive\u201d support. \u201cI look forward to working with Survivors Against Terror to ensure that their experiences help shape the work we do,\u201d she added. Becky Rigby, whose husband Lee Rigby was murdered in 2013, said: \u201cOne the most difficult things I\u2019ve ever had to do was to sit my little boy down and tell him what happened to his Daddy. \u201c[Terrorists have] taken so much from so many people but there\u2019s so many more that can stand up and stand together, and it\u2019s just a shame that it took something so horrific to see that goodness in people.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
