But the first lady\u2019s guest list in the viewing box may reveal the surprises to come: it\u2019s not just Alan Gross, who was held in Cuba for five years, getting an invitation to spend the night within earshot of Michelle Obama and eyesight of the president in Washington\u2019s most watched seating box. From the faces that could lead to Obama\u2019s \u201cFerguson moment\u201d to the humanity behind the partisan gridlock on issues like immigration, the environment and healthcare, these are the American stories the president will be highlighting, in order to get through the more difficult \u2013 but altogether less wonky and perhaps more memorable \u2013 parts of his penultimate State of the Union speech. Race and policing: a teenager, a cop and an ex-convict set for reform Malik Bryant The 13-year-old Chicago resident will be the youngest of nearly two dozen official guests in the box. He was invited after a letter he sent to Santa Claus \u2013 a letter asking for \u201csafety\u201d \u2013 was rerouted to the president\u2019s desk. Bryant\u2019s request could be tied to the racial tensions laid bare between police departments and citizens after the white police officer Darren Wilson fatally shot the unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. As protests grew across the nation, black 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by police in Ohio. What to watch for: Many have been calling for Obama to make a sweeping public statement about race and police violence, but he has taken a fairly cautious stance in the six month\u2019s since Brown\u2019s death. This could be the moment for long-awaited rhetoric. Captain Phillip C Tingirides With protesters and everyday Americans pushing Obama to speak out on cop killings and the future of community policing, the White House has invited the Los Angeles Police Department captain. Tingirides spearheaded a community policing program in Watts, a neighborhood famous for being the scene of race riots in 1965. What to watch for: Obama has created a task force to address the community issues, with recommendations due in March. He could cite Tingirides as part of an emphasis on where he\u2019d like those ideas to lean. Prophet Walker At age 27, Walker has already served six years in prison for robbery, become a construction engineer and worked in multiple nonprofits aimed at improving the criminal justice system and police relations \u2013 including work with Tingirides of the LAPD. What to watch for: With US attorney general Eric Holder headed for retirement, some have suggested that a roadmap for major justice-system reform may be in the offing. Scott Kelly The most prominent US astronaut of the moment, Kelly is preparing to become the first American to live and work on the International Space Station for a year. Scientists will also compare Kelly\u2019s medical data with that of his twin brother and fellow astronaut, Mark, to learn more about how the human body works in space. What to watch for: Scott Kelly\u2019s presence will probably serve as a reminder that Obama wants to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, despite cutting back Nasa funds. The efforts of his brother and his brother\u2019s wife, Gabrielle Giffords, will only serve to reinforce the spectre of gun violence. The economy: faces for Robin Hood, minimum wage and workers Rebekah Erler Obama spent a day with this Minnesota resident, whose story he sees as a kind of microcosm of how middle-class families are making progress, but still struggling after the economic recession. Perhaps the most audacious plan Obama outlined ahead of his speech is a proposal to close loopholes for the wealthiest Americans and reform the tax code to benefit the middle class. What to watch for: The tax overture \u2013 already dubbed the \u201cRobin Hood\u201d plan \u2013 would seem to dismantle some of the economic principles modern Republicans hold most dear. The GOP has quickly voiced its opposition, but Obama is already trying to put a human face on the inequality front. Catherine Pugh The only politician to be invited into the box, Pugh is Maryland\u2019s state senate majority leader and president-elect of the National Black Caucus of State Legislatures. She pushed for a minimum wage increase in the state and has introduced a bill to give workers in the state earned paid sick leave. What to watch for: A handful of local governments have pushed to raise minimum wage, and after years of demonstrations by workers demanding better treatment, large corporations are making small moves to acquiesce to their demands. LeDaya Epps One of two women to complete a Los Angeles-area union apprenticeship in construction and now, after years of unstable employment, Epps has a job that enables her to support her three children. What to watch for: Women still earn 77 cents for every dollar that a man makes, according to 2012 census data. The data is even worse for African American women, who make 66 cents for every dollar all men make. Carolyn Reed This Colorado resident and her husband own seven sandwich shops and credit the Small Business Administration loan program for allowing them to raise wages for all of their employees last year. What to watch for: Meanwhile, large corporations are continuing to resist a movement to raise hourly rates for low-wage workers. And the overall benefits of the SBA loan program have been challenged in several studies. Studies also show that racial discrimination in loan programs is a pressing issue. Victor Fugate This Missouri resident was employed for \u201ca while\u201d a few years ago but earned a degree and found a full-time job. He credited the Affordable Care Act and student loan payment plans for helping himself and his wife get security. What to watch for: Unemployment rates are continuing to drop, but the latest figures show nine million Americans are still out of work. And many of those regaining employment are doing so in low-wage industries. Long-term unemployment is still a problem, with people out of jobs for 27 weeks or more accounting for 32% of the unemployed. Tiairris Woodward This mother of three used to work 17 hours a day at Chrysler and a local school system in Michigan before joining a union and Chrysler\u2019s tuition assistance program. What to watch for: Detroit\u2019s recovery is an important spot for Obama to highlight his contributions to the economy, but the city\u2019s long struggle and nascent rebound are individual to the city, one of several that has had to file for bankruptcy in the wake of the economic recession. War, peace and diplomacy \u2013 including the face of Cuban-American relations Jason Gibson After being gravely wounded in Afghanistan, Gibson told Obama that he received excellent healthcare, has become a new father and is moving into a new home. His story comes months after Veterans Affairs secretary Eric Shinseki resigned in May after failing to conceal or remedy the dangerous systemic backlog of veterans waiting for care on hospital waiting lists. What to watch for: The Afghanistan war may be winding down, but with many plates to spin on national security and foreign policy, this may be the way to bring it all back home. Alan and Judy Gross With much fanfare and a menschy press conference, Alan Gross returned to the US in December after being held in Cuba for five years. The surprise return accompanied the news that the US would finally ease its relations with Cuba. What to watch for: The Cuban embargo is still in place and some are concerned about how restoring relations could affect immigration law, a key issue in Obama\u2019s presidency. The tough stuff: immigration, the environment and Obamacare Ana Zamora The daughter of two people living in the US illegally, Zamora travelled from Texas to Washington for the speech as a representative of the benefits of the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. What to watch for: The official White House statement says Zamora\u2019s parents are \u201cpotentially eligible\u201d to benefit from the executive action on immigration Obama announced in November. His sweeping action overlooked the parents of people who were given temporarily relief and work authorization under Daca. Nicole Hernandez Hammer An environmental activist who also works as a sea level rise researcher, Hernandez Hammer is working to show how climate change will have devastating effects on her local community in south Florida and the rest of the world. What to watch for: Obama has announced plans to curb emissions, but the state of the global environment is still dismal, as a report released last week shows that 2014 was the hottest year on record. Critics say his plan to curb methane emissions overlooks existing oil and gas infrastructure and the considerable pollution it creates. Astrid Muhammad Muhammad sent a letter to Obama, praising the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for allowing her to get treatment for a potentially fatal brain tumor. Under previous healthcare laws, she could have been turned away for having a \u201cpre-existing condition\u201d. What to watch for: The law she credits with effectively saving her life is still facing pushback from Republican lawmakers, and the overall economic benefits of the ACA are still unclear. But it\u2019s tough to jeer a mother of two. William Elder Jr This medical student benefited from precision medicine to treat his cystic fibrosis, inspiring him to pursue a career in family medicine with a focus on preventive care. What to watch for: While his story is touted for showing the benefits of precision medicine, an emerging type of treatment, such nuanced discussions of healthcare are largely unacknowledged in the current political climate as Republicans focus on undoing the five-year-old Obamacare program. Kathy Pham This guest blends the worlds of technology and health to improve treatment and care for Americans, especially veterans like her brother. There has been a drop in backlog claims, which represent the amount of first-time claims to Veteran Affairs that have been unresolved for more than four months, but the latest report shows that it still at about 245,000. What to watch for: Pham\u2019s mother also received cancer treatment because of the ACA, which the new Republican majority is attempting to dismantle over the coming months. Larry Merlo The president and CEO of CVS Health was invited to the speech because of his company\u2019s initiative to hire some of the groups hardest hit by the economic downturn: veterans, the long-term unemployed and transition workers moving off public assistance. What to watch for: The administration also praised his commitment to health, pointing to the store\u2019s decision to eliminate tobacco sales at all of its stores. The decision is beneficial, but also overlooks the collection of enormously unhealthy products it continues to stock. Pranav Shetty The Washington DC-based doctor has been shuttling between west Africa in the US as a critical figure in the fight against Ebola, which has killed more than 7,500 people since the latest outbreak started in December 2013. What to watch for: Liberia and districts in Sierra Leone began the year reporting a decline in the number of outbreaks, but Americans are now using these successes to point to the need to address other global health issues besetting the international community. Education: affordability, debt and diversity Anthony Mendez The first person to graduate from high school in his family, this University of Hartford will be in the first lady\u2019s box because he exemplifies Michelle Obama\u2019s Reach Higher initiative. The program encourages students to complete some form of education past high school, even if they face setbacks like Mendez, who was at one point living with his family in his homeless shelter. What to watch for: Students interested in pursuing higher education, however, must face a system of high tuition and the resulting student loan debt. Katrice Mubiru This career-technical education teacher wrote to the president to share stories about students achieving degrees in spite of the financial challenges. Obama highlighted the importance of technical programs in a visit to the school Mubiru teaches at. What to watch for: Technical education programs are not as costly as a four-year degree \u2013 and they\u2019re meant to address the opportunity gap faced by low-income families and non-white students. Chelsey Davis She\u2019s set to graduate from Pellissippi State Community College in her home state of Tennessee this year. Earlier this month, Obama promoted his proposal to make two years of community college free at Davis\u2019s school, but it was immediately met with opposition from the House speaker, John Boehner. What to watch for: The community college plan requires congressional approval, and its $60bn price tag is unlikely to sway the Republican majority."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
