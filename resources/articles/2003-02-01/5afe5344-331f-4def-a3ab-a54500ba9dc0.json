Can you hear it? Yep, it's the sound of a young scally about to make his England bow at the tender age of 17. Yes, just 17! And it's the sound, not of his mates on the blower for a few spare tickets, nor of a Gulf GTI turbo being revved up for a handbrake turn in the Asda car park, not even of the top being cracked off a bottle of Thunderbird in celebration. Rather it's the sound of silence. \"He is 17, but he is not speaking too loudly,\" Svennis said of 17-year-old starlet Wayne Rooney today. The quirky Swede went on to confirm that Rooney (17) would become the youngest player ever to play for England tomorrow night, aged a mere 17. The 17-year-old striker will feature as part of a 'young XI' which will appear in the second half of England's really important game against Australia. \"When you are 17 and playing a senior match for England there is going to be huge interest,\" said the gaffer of Rooney, 17, in a not-at-all-stating-the-obvious kind of way. \"He's 17 and he's maybe a little bit nervous,\" added the crazy fan of time-outs and Matthew Upson. As for Rooney, who's not 18 (repeat, NOT 18) until October, there were no such incisive words from him. Zip. Nada. Rien. But that won't stop the national press splashing the 17-year-old all over their back pages tomorrow, so we thought we'd get in on the act first with this gushing endorsement from skipper Dave Beckham: \"He is so young [17, Dave] and has been quiet around the hotel, but he has fitted in well.\" Sounds like a barrel of laughs, that England camp. A JIMMY RIDDLE Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is so expressive, he is perhaps the only person in the world whose Spitting Image puppet would end up understating his physical features. When he smiles, the hearts of a million virgins melt. When he flutters his eyelashes, the houses of a million Texans are taken out by a tornado. When he scowls, it means that Gianfranco passed to Eidur instead. So consider the effect of these super-expressive words of Jimmy's back in August. \"I would love to come - it is the chance of a lifetime.\" No, not Kuddly Ken's offer of an all-expenses-paid trip to Chessington World of Adventures, but Barcelona's offer of an all-expenses-paid trip to FC Barcelona. \"If Barca sign me, I would not even pack my suitcase!\" he added. \"I would come in what I was wearing!\" Since then, Barcelona have lost more than Shane Warne on a crash diet of laxative-laced prunes, and Dutch coach Louis van Gaal has been sacked, scuppering the Dutch striker's proposed \u00a38m move. Of course, none of this is at all pertinent in the light of Jimmy's revelation today that he wants to end up a Chelsea pensioner. \"I'd like to finish my career at Chelsea if it's possible,\" he told London's London Evening Standard. Er, James, old fruit? What about that chance-of-a-lifetime thingy? \"I'm flattered they're interested but I never said I'd go.\" Right. Except that you did. Look, it's up there in paragraph two. \"Hopefully I can carry on for two years after my current contract finishes. I will have had 18 years of professional football, which is a good time to pack your bags.\" At least then he won't have to leave without a clean pair of undies. NOT-FOOTBALL-BUT-THE-FIVER-LIKES-IT QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Our preparation has been mostly relaxed. Most of us trained for an hour or two most days, doing what we had to do to keep in trim without tiring ourselves out. On a lighter note, I was intrigued to see an Afrikaans-language newspaper suggesting that I have had a facelift. It seems that a plastic surgeon thought it suspicious that I do not have more wrinkles after losing weight\" - Shane Warne looks forward to the World Cup in today's Times. Comedy is all about timing, isn't it? REMEMBER ME The great football administrators always leave something for the world to remember them by. In the 1920s, Jules Rimet ensured his name would resonate through the ages by changing the face of international football with his World Cup. Thirty years later, the fondly-remembered Henri Delaunay irrefutably altered the European club scene forever with his Big Cup genius. Sadly, compared to these towering legacies, Fifa president Sepp Blatter and Uefa bigwig Lennart Johannsen look like producing very little of import for their combined \"efforts\". But while the phrases \"Lennart Johannsen\" and \"lasting reverberations\" are only ever likely to co-exist in the context of a particularly hearty full English breakfast, Sepp is determined to make his mark. That's why he is battling like mad to save the Confederations Cup, the tournament where the champions of each confederation play each other in a round-robin, or maybe it's a knock-out format, actually, we can't even remember who played in it last time round, never mind what happened or who ended up winning it. \"As for the Confederations Cup, we were obliged by contract to hold it again in 2003,\" Blatter told France Football magazine today. \"I can tell you however that we are thinking of reducing its frequency by scheduling it every four years in the year before the World Cup. It would be a way to test the organisation of our showcase event.\" Blatter then denied that the crowded football calendar is the fault of his currently bi-annual cup. Instead, he pointed the finger at Uefa's over-long Big Cup schedule. Lennart? Bloated? Never! THE RUMOUR MILL Sheffield United's Michael Brown is on the must-buy list for the new collection at Chelsea's of Chelsea. Liverpool and Bolton (whose names you may be seeing in increasingly close proximity over the coming weeks) are both fighting off Celtic's Milan Rapaic. Matt Jansen: just 12 months ago off to Japan. Now off to Burnley. NEWS IN LENGTH Mark Hughes was a sensitive type as a player, and he's adopting the same caring, sharing style as a manager: the Wales boss has shown touching empathy in a bid to boost the confidence of players struggling to play regularly for their clubs. Goalkeeper Paul Jones will win his 30th cap against Bosnia and defender Andy Melville should collect his 56th despite a lack of action for Southampton and Fulham respectively. \"International football is a Godsend to players having a difficult time at club level,\" said Sparky. \"It certainly helped me when I was struggling with Barcelona.\" Much like the boss himself, things at Oldham are not looking good and Iain Dowie has been ordered to sack members of his backroom staff to ease the financial crisis at Boundary Park. The Second Division promotion chasers are losing \u00a350,000-a-week, despite cutbacks on and off the field. \"We are talking about people's jobs, and those I work with have been absolutely fantastic,\" said Dowie. So fantastic that most of them will be getting a P45 next week. It's cool, it's flash and it's snappy. Yes, Yugoslavia have rebranded as Serbia &amp; Montenegro, after the funky new monicker was formally ratified by the United Nations. The Football Association of Yugoslavia will now be known, as - can you guess? - the Football Association of Serbia and Montenegro (or the catchy FSSCG for short).
