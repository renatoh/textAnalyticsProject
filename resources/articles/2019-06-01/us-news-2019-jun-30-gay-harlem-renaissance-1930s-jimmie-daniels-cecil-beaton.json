In the 1920s and 30s black Harlemites went to Britain, seeking new experiences, opportunities and lovers. In turn, British queers and lesbians came to Harlem too. After the great war, many in the artistic elite were determined to celebrate simple survival. Through drink, drugs, sex and social provocation, these \u201cbright young people\u201d set out to have a good time. For a while, Harlem seemed at the center of the bohemian world. Sojourning there, some of the bright young things came to see \u201canother arrondissement of Paris\u201d. Few noticed overcrowding and poverty, or appreciated that the parents or grandparents of its residents had often been slaves. Rather, among the British who visited a fashionable notion prevailed: that Negros held an unspoiled vitality. By this mojo alone, some thought, the spent-force of white humanity might be saved from itself. Gay Harlem certainly had vitality. On 22 February 1929, the black journalist Geraldyn Dismond wrote for the Interstate Tatler about the \u201cFaggot\u2019s Ball\u201d, a precursor to today\u2019s ball culture at which crowds always gathered to gawk. \u201cThe greatest joy in life,\u201d she wrote, \u201cis to be able to express one\u2019s inner self. The second greatest joy is to be able to mingle with one\u2019s kind. The third greatest joy is to receive the plaudits of one\u2019s fellows. And thereby hangs the success of the Hamilton Lodge dances which for 61 years have thrilled and entertained the most blas\u00e9 of New York.\u201d Purring over \u201cgowns of all descriptions, jewels, feathers and beauty beyond words\u201d, Dismond singled out \u201cabove and over all, a spirit of abandon, hilarity and camaraderie that fired the imagination and made for a true fiesta\u201d. \u201cOf course, a costume ball can be a very tame thing, but when all the exquisitely gowned women on the floor are men and a number of the smartest men are women, ah then, we have something over which to thrill and grow round-eyed \u2026 Never no wells of loneliness in Harlem\u2026\u201d Small wonder so many artistic Brits arrived. The female impersonator Douglas Byng was acclaimed when he appeared at the Cotton Club in 1930. Lady Louis Mountbatten came, as did the actress Beatrice Lillie, Sir Osbert Sitwell, Stephen Tennant, Lord Peter Churchill, Noel Coward, David Plunket-Green and even Archie Leach, who later became the movie star Cary Grant, his New York \u201croommate\u201d the future Hollywood fashion designer George Kelly, known as \u201cOrry-Kelly\u201d. There was also the artist Edward Burra, ballet dancer Fredrick Ashton, Christopher Isherwood, the speed-boat racing heiress Marion \u201cJoe\u201d Carstairs, and Ivor Novello. All came to Harlem, as if on a soul-stirring pilgrimage. In turn, they met the best of Harlem. In print and on the radio, Dismond was its leading society reporter. Selma Burke was a young sculptor, Harold Jackman, a French teacher acclaimed as the handsomest man in Harlem, was the son of a Jamaican mother and a white Harley Street doctor. Ethel Waters was a well-known singer and actor. Among such souls, friendship across the \u201ccolor-line\u201d became a mark of evolved civility. But one windswept night in 1938, this concept would be put to the test. \u2018He crashed my party\u2026\u2019 It was a smart cocktail party, attended by 50 enlightened souls. But it was gatecrashed and its African American host would bring a half-million dollar libel suit against the gatecrasher himself: the great photographer Cecil Beaton. Beaton was familiar with Harlem, having first visited in 1928. By 1929 he was well-known enough there to be asked to help judge the Odd Fellows\u2019 Masquerade Ball, the festivity described by Dismond, licensed by the police, that allowed men and women to cross-dress legally. A decade later, though, Beaton betrayed Harlem\u2019s esteem. On 11 February 1938, Jay William Clifford and his wife\u2019s cocktail party commenced in a top-floor apartment at the Monterey, a building on a plaza with a bronze statue of Washington and Lafayette, overlooking Morningside Park at 114th Street. The modernistic decor had been devised by a gay African American interior designer, Harold Curtis Brown. Trained at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts School and in London and Paris, he designed some of Harlem\u2019s most select clubs and chicest apartments. He supplied the Cotton Club with salacious murals where burley \u201cbucks\u201d pursue seductive \u201cwenches\u201d. At the Cliffords\u2019, he created polychrome, tartan-like wall paintings. Beaton was already under a cloud, fresh from a scandal over minutely drawn antisemitic missives discovered in illustrations for American Vogue. When the book Cecil Beaton\u2019s New York appeared, the following year, it would reveal patronizing thoughts about his night at the Cliffords\u2019. Ridiculing artificial ivy twined round the steam pipes of the foyer, mocking the way the faux marble mantelpiece swayed to the touch, Beaton heaped animus on Brown\u2019s decorative theatricality. Worse, he supposedly quoted racist insults by acquaintances, such as: \u201cI like niggers. I know several and they\u2019re just as nice and cozy...\u201d His initial fascination had given way to scorn. Harlem, he wrote, was \u201ca Negro reservation in a white man\u2019s city\u201d. Clifford\u2019s relative affluence lay in his position as US customs inspector, specializing in discovering smuggled narcotics. Beaton called him \u201ca rich Negro\u201d. Going for the jugular with crass characterizations, he described fellow guests as \u201cenormous black mammas, isolated in their jet and sequins\u201d. Jimmie Daniels was a black gay cabaret singer, the toast of Monte Carlo\u2019s Summer Sporting Club and Ciro\u2019s in London. He was mocked by Beaton as a little man at the piano, reciting \u201cembarrassingly mediocre verse in a tragic voice\u2026\u201d Beaton avoided direct reference to other gay black friends and various whites in attendance. Carl Van Vechten, for example, a red-faced blond with an overbite, eluded the author\u2019s ire. Gay but married to the actress Fania Marinoff, Van Vechten was a critic and writer considered the great white father of Harlem\u2019s cultural renaissance. Through him, promising black poets met the best publishers. Gifted artists were presented to rich collectors. Van Vechten also parlayed his Harlem forays into a novel, provocatively titled Nigger Heaven, derived from the local slang for theater balconies, where even in Harlem black people were mostly made to sit. The name was also a clever analogy for Harlem\u2019s geographic and social situation, connected to and overlooking the rest of Manhattan but from a distant remove. Van Vechten was recognizable in Beaton\u2019s account of the Cliffords\u2019 party, by reference to his daisy embroidered shirt collar and cuffs. But he was not named. Nor were Beaton\u2019s friends from home. On their honeymoon, David Tennant and his wife were accompanied Olivia Wyndham, Tennant\u2019s first cousin. Count and Countess Friedrich von Ledebur were present, the countess the former Iris Tree. Godfrey Reinhardt, son of a famed impresario, was another visitor. His presence did prompt lampoon: \u201cWhy, it\u2019s gettin\u2019 to be more\u2019n more like a League of Nations here. Hey, hey, hey!\u201d The point of Beaton\u2019s send-up seems to have been that fellow guests who were black and their hosts \u2013 whom he called \u201ctree-climbers\u201d and \u201coctoroons\u201d \u2013 were guilty of being affected and pretentious. Never mind that the \u201cmiddle class\u201d Beaton might have been called out for putting on airs himself. Naturally enough, when Beaton\u2019s book was published, Jay William Clifford was furious. \u201cHe crashed my party,\u201d he fumed, \u201c[he] disrespected my wife and guest and affronted Negros generally.\u201d It particularly irked him, he said, that Beaton had written to his wife from the Waldorf Astoria, thanking her \u201cfor a wonderful time\u201d. And so, Clifford sued. \u2018The most responsive lover\u2019 So much for Cecil Beaton. On this Pride weekend, more than 75 years later, other guests at the Cliffords\u2019 famous party are more deserving of remembrance. Jimmie Daniels, said the great modern architect Philip Johnson, was \u201clithe, handsome, fun and charismatic, sexually \u2026 the most responsive lover I ever had.\u201d Beginning in 1934, the pair conducted assignations for two years, most often in a large apartment at 1890 Seventh Avenue, a cooperative unit in which Daniels shared a room with lauded novelist Wallace Thurman and which was owned by distinguished actress Edna Lewis Thomas. Thomas was at the Clifford party too, with her husband Lloyd Thomas and her lover, Olivia Wyndham. Edna Lewis Thomas was immortalized by her interpretation of Lady Macbeth in Orson Wells\u2019 stage debut, in Harlem in 1936. Olivia Wyndham, a photographer-party giver and goer, was a member of one of England\u2019s most distinguished families. She first ventured to Harlem in 1930, as the wife of Howland Spencer. Her new husband made a career of marrying rich women and was also gay. He miscalculated. Although a great-great-granddaughter of the last Earl of Egremont, at least by New York society standards Wyndham was poor. And she too had blundered, imagining Spencer a wealthy \u201cbeard\u201d. As for Daniels and Johnson, they drifted apart. \u201cI was sadder than I\u2019d thought I might be,\u201d Johnson later said, though he admitted that the passionate youth \u201cprobably left me for someone who was better in bed\u201d. Johnson\u2019s inability to protect his black boyfriend from the indignity of fancy restaurants failing to provide service on account of his color, or his admitted failure to always include him at parties and on trips, seem more logical reasons for their break-up. Daniels\u2019 next partner was married to a very rich and encouraging lesbian, the acclaimed poet \u201cBryher\u201d, aka Winifred Ellerman. Kenneth Macpherson was a more caring lover. At the Clifford shindig, the Scottish writer was by his boyfriend\u2019s side. Georgette Harvey, a singer with a deep melodious voice, was there too. She came with her lover, the singer Musa Williams. Harvey, who originated the role of Maria in Porgy and Bess, had returned to Harlem after starring in St Petersburg for 16 years, a charmed existence cut short by revolution. She reflected wistfully: \u201cAt the peak of my career I had a large town house, jewels, sables, social position and immense popularity with the livelier members of Czar Nicholas\u2019 court. Among my lovers was one of the most famous of the Russian courtesans. \u201cIn the revolution I lost everything, including seventy-five thousand dollars\u2026Homosexuality is a lonely life\u2026\u201d Were these denizens of Harlem really so different? Were they less accomplished, more boorish and boasting than Beaton and his kind? One suspects not. Years later, in 1950, Our World magazine retraced Beaton\u2019s steps in New York, setting out to see what the black beau monde was really like. Its conclusion? \u201cBeaton lied!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
