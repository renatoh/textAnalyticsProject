Amnesty International is lobbying MPs to support a treaty as it publishes a report exposing how governments connive in letting contractors exploit legal loopholes to break arms embargoes. It says arms are being exported or diverted to embargoed countries, criminal gangs, and armed groups, including terrorists, and adds that British companies have been implicated in the shipment of explosives to Congo and in flights taking weapons there."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
