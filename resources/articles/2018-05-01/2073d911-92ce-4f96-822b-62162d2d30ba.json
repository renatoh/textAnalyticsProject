The prime minister promised \u00a32bn last year for a new generation of council houses and affordable homes for rent, but 71% of senior councillors from her party told a poll by Survation they were worried this would not be enough to meet the needs of their constituents. The survey of 121 Tory council leaders and heads of housing from across the country, funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, found an overwhelming majority \u2013 96% \u2013 wanted low-cost rented homes to form part of the solution. Another report has found that parents are likely to be lending less money to help their children on to the property ladder this year, owing to constrained household budgets since the EU referendum. The so-called bank of mum and dad now has less money available to support property purchases than in recent years, according to the study by the Centre for Economics and Business Research commissioned by the insurance company Legal &amp; General. The amount of financial support is expected to fall from \u00a36.5bn last year to \u00a35.7bn in 2018, although parents are still expected to help finance as many as one in four property sales. The predicted fall is the first since the research began in 2016. According to the study, the average contribution from parents towards housing is expected to decline from \u00a321,600 in 2017 to \u00a318,000 this year. While showing the mounting pressure on household finances, the figures still highlight the growing importance of inherited wealth in modern Britain. There are fears that home ownership will increasingly be reserved for the children of the rich, adding to mounting levels of inequality. After years of growth since the 1980s, home ownership has been falling in recent years, to the grave concern of Conservatives, who have traditionally been able to rely on the votes of owner-occupiers. Amid a lack of new housebuilding and rising prices over the past decade, young people aged 25-34 are now less likely to own a home than were people of that age in the early 1960s. Independent analysis suggests current construction of affordable housing falls short of the requirements by about 30,000 homes per year. Joseph Rowntree said it was calling on the government to deliver at least 80,000 low-cost rented homes a year in order to make the housing market work for more people. Campbell Robb, the charity\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cHomelessness and poverty should have no place in our society. However, right now millions of people are locked out of being able to achieve a decent standard of living due to crippling rents.\u201d The publication of a green paper on social housing is expected within the coming months. Ministers have used policies such as the help-to-buy scheme to support first-time buyers, although experts say a better solution would be to build more affordable homes across the country. The Tories have promised to deliver an average of 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s, up from 217,000 in 2016. Gary Porter, the chair of the Local Government Association and the Conservative leader of South Holland district council in Lincolnshire, pointed out that the last time Britain built more than 250,000 homes in a year, councils built 40% of them. Urging the government to lift a cap on the amount of money councils can borrow to fund housebuilding, he said: \u201cDoing so would spark a renaissance in housebuilding, allowing us in local government to do our bit to help address the housing crisis.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
