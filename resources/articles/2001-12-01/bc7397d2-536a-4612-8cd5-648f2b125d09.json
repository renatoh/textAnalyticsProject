If the idea was to get everyone in a festive mood it certainly did not work on the home fans - the football that followed left the Watford faithful feeling neither joyful nor triumphant; just very, very lucky. A run of one defeat in 10 league games had given the Hornets hope that a season that started so disappointingly could yet be resurrected. While that sequence continues there was little evidence here that they can consider themselves Wolves' equals in the promotion hunt, as a neat tactical switch at half-time earned the visitors near total domination. That Watford were not beaten can be credited to two things: the impartial approach of the referee, David Crick, in turning down penalty appeals from both sides and an astonishing miss by Nathan Blake. In the third minute of the second half Shaun Newton, the scorer of Wolves' early goal from Mark Kennedy's cross, cut inside Paul Robinson on the right flank and drilled the ball low and hard towards the far post. With the goal completely open, Blake arrived unmarked to shoot across the entire face of the goal and out of play. \"These things happen,\" said the Watford goalscorer and inspiration Tommy Smith. \"I think he was surprised as it whisked across and it just seemed to hit his feet - which is disappointing for him, obviously, but brilliant for us.\" The miss was symptomatic of a broader problem at Wolves. No player has scored 20 goals for them in a single season since Steve Bull in 1997, although enough people have tried. Last week the latest failures, Michael Branch and Cedric Roussel, were transfer-listed. This week the most likely solution, Dean Sturridge, should join. After only seven appearances he is already the club's joint top scorer. His loan deal from Leicester has now expired but both player and club hope he will stay. \"When I came off the pitch the manager said, 'We'll make sure we sort it out and make you a Wolverhampton player',\" Sturridge said. \"I've enjoyed my time here, but we'll have to see how determined they are to bring me to the club because I've enjoyed my time here and obviously it has been enjoyable.\" Er, quite. Man of the match: Mark Kennedy (Wolverhampton)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
