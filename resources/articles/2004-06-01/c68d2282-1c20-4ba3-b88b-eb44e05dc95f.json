Most of the fans wearing shirts expressing their allegiance to David Beckham and Michael Owen, their faces painted with the cross of St George, were English. That was the difference between the City of Manchester Stadium last night and the arenas in Sapporo, Saitama, Shizuoka and elsewhere in Japan where England pursued their 2002 World Cup campaign, and where they were cheered to the echo by hordes of Japanese fans. Not half as strange, however, as seeing England take the field and play for an hour and a quarter without an authentic defensive midfield player. And stranger still when it is remembered that England's next competitive match, their first fixture in the group phase of the Euro 2004 finals, is against France, whose presiding genius is just the sort of player requiring the attention of a specialist in preventive action. The history of the last half-dozen years suggests that if Zin\u00e9dine Zidane is unavailable or only half-fit, it doesn't matter much what formation you send out against France. The chances are, however, that he will be viewing this month's matches in Portugal as an opportunity to expunge the memory of 2002, when a thigh injury reduced him to the status of a passenger, picked only for his talismanic value. If he is fit and hungry, Zidane will require a much higher level of activity than England were able to devote last night to the task of closing up the central areas. It was a surprise to find that Sven-Goran Eriksson, after promising to send out the 11 players that he plans to pick for the opening match against Jacques Santini's team in Lisbon on Sunday week, had in fact selected what one can only hope was a highly experimental midfield formation. There needs to be no controversy over his choice of a diamond formation, which suits England's temperament and is capable of providing flexibility. But his selection of players to carry out the specific roles in the starting line-up was very much open to question before the match began, and even more so when England found themselves pondering the significance of a 1-1 draw. Only David Beckham and Paul Scholes lined up in the positions with which they are commonly associated. Steven Gerrard was stationed out on the left, and Frank Lampard took the holding midfielder's berth usually occupied by Nicky Butt. The 76 minutes they spent together on the pitch demonstrated that this formation would be unlikely to work even if the participants were given a year to understand their roles and to polish their lines. Once it became apparent, 24 hours before the kick-off, that Eriksson had this line-up in mind, much was made in some quarters of the ability of Lampard, Beckham, Scholes and Gerrard to turn themselves into effective tacklers when necessary. Nothing could be further from the truth. Lampard has no talent for preventing players getting past him. Beckham thinks he has, but his attempts are often blusteringly counter-productive. Gerrard can win the ball when the odds are 50-50, and sometimes even 60-40 against, but his tackling technique is rudimentary and his interceptions still betray the signs of a young man's rashness. As for Scholes, we have seen on many occasions - not least when he got himself sent off against Sweden at Wembley a few years ago - how inadequate his tackling can be. And for those who had forgotten, there was a series of wholehearted but literally misguided efforts in the first half last night, culminating in the blundering charge from behind that sent Alessandro Santos crashing to the ground inside the area a couple of minutes before the interval, after Japan's Brazilian-born left-wing-back had tricked his way past John Terry. A certain penalty was denied by the Italian referee. Roberto Rosetti's generosity to the hosts was misplaced, since an equaliser for Japan then might have persuaded Eriksson to realign his forces for the second half. Instead England returned from the interval with the same formation and paid the price within minutes when Shunsuke Nakamura's pass opened up their left flank and Shinji Ono calmly put the finishing touch to Santos's low cross. The lack of cover said everything about the deficiencies of England's midfield combination. Given Butt's shortage of match practice, it was a mystery that Eriksson did not opt to try Owen Hargreaves in the role from the start. In an attempt to incorporate the in-form Lampard without dropping Scholes, Eriksson chose to pick two of his four midfield players out of position - the very thing he seemed so assiduously to avoid when taking the first steps towards rebuilding the chaotic legacy of Kevin Keegan. Major tournaments are invariably won by teams based on unglamorous players such as Carlos Dunga, Didier Deschamps and, as recently as last week's European Cup final, the unheralded Costinha. Reliable metronomes, efficient water-carriers. If Eriksson really hopes to succeed in Portugal, he will need to think again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
