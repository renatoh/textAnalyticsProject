Their latest fusion of jazzy sounds and sharp dance for Donaldson's new company, Arts Beyond Contemporary Dance, is England is Mine, a triple bill of fresh, energetic works featuring some of the best male dancers around. Donaldson has three aces up her sleeve with former Phoenix dancers Gee Goodison, Tony Louis and Stephen Derrick. All are powerful, elegant and dynamic. The boys were back in town for Taking Flight, originally created with a group of young people in Ireland. A series of three duos with the men partnering Debbie Wild, Carolyn Baker and Sarah Mellor, the piece looks at new beginnings and flying solo in life, with music that takes you airborne. Driven by Anderson's rhythms, the couples sprout wings for fast and intricate moves. There are dazzling leaps and soaring lifts, the motifs repeated by the pairs in sinuous duos, the women slithering over the men's shoulders like serpents. The women, although gifted performers, are left in the vapour trail of the men's experience and exceptional technique. Infant Eyes is Donaldson's playful, lovingly observed look at childhood and the dynamics of the family unit. Backed by Anderson and a quartet of accomplished musicians, this was a lively opener with Derrick the father figure, the girls leapfrogging and using a bench as prop. At one point a body is unfurled along the bench like a roll of fabric, and there are fun, sisterly asides and shifting moods. It is a joyful mix of controlled acrobatics and lyricism, the dancers travelling and using the space in neat formations and patterns to the infectious, jazzy score. The title piece, England Is Mine, muses on what it is like to be living in England today. Devised through improvisation, it shifts from introverted solos danced to soulful saxophone to lively vocal memories of all things British. Full of inventive action and gestures, it is another freewheeling, upbeat creation. Although some of the improvised groupings went astray, it was hardly noticeable, because you were riveted by the band. A great collaboration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
