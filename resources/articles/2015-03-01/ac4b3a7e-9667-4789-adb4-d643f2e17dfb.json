Hamilton turned 30 in January but he looks and sounds younger, for there is a touch of Neverland in a man whose young life was controlled by first his father, Anthony, and then Ron Dennis at McLaren. In recent years, it has often seemed, he has been making a delayed passage through his adolescence. \u201cI\u2019m conscious that I\u2019m halfway through my career or maybe past halfway,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the next six or seven years, whatever I get, will come about quickly. And I\u2019m conscious that whatever steps I take now will determine what I do when I finish. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a commentator. That\u2019s just not for me, although I think I\u2019d be OK at it because I know much about the sport. But there\u2019s other things that I would like to try to do. \u201cGrowing up, I was restricted in being made aware of my creative side. Over the last few years I\u2019ve started to really be aware of that. There are things that I\u2019m really quite creative in and so I\u2019m going to try to see where that takes me. So I\u2019m trying lots of different things.\u201d He even hinted he would like to design the cars he drives. \u201cCars, I\u2019d love to do something with cars. Maybe not design the whole car but when I was at McLaren I [designed] my steering wheel.\u201d He\u2019s probably not ready to replace Adrian Newey just yet. \u201cArt was good when I was at school,\u201d he says. \u201cI did my whole house. I\u2019m good at choosing and picking colours. Whether it\u2019s clothes or something I might try to indulge in that at some stage, just do my own stuff.\u201d For some years now Hamilton has enjoyed writing songs. \u201cIt\u2019s more of my life than people are aware of and that hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s what I spent a lot of my spare time doing last year. I think when you\u2019re doing music, you have a choice of how much you want to show and how vulnerable you want to be. \u201cSo you can decide on that. Some people do more on it than others. But I approach it as a hobby, something I enjoy doing. It\u2019s therapeutic. I\u2019ve never been tempted to release anything but I\u2019ve not had the worst of comments about them. I\u2019m not a rapper. Someone has said that I\u2019m an aspiring rapper.\u201d In the past, Hamilton has spoken about setting up a museum, or a foundation, and he has made some progress. \u201cI have taken the first step. I\u2019ve collated all of my trophies and there\u2019s now a folder from every year, what everything is, where they are and they\u2019ve all been boxed nicely. It\u2019s quite a few [trophies]. Just out of go-karting there were, like, three or four hundred, or something like that, so I would imagine it\u2019s probably close to 500.\u201d He also has replicas of the trophies he won at McLaren. \u201cI think I have got two [original] trophies from McLaren. My first trophy, my first win [Montreal 2007] I was able to keep, and my first Monaco win in 2008.\u201d But it is Hamilton\u2019s day job that most people are interested in and he goes into the new season in Melbourne on Sunday as the favourite to retain his championship, though life is rarely straightforward for this incident-prone sportsman. And he expects more clashes with his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, who is once again expected to be his closest challenger. \u201cOur relationship seems quite good, to be honest but it\u2019s before the season starts and when you get in the heat of the moment, and there\u2019s \u2026 you have to assume there\u2019s going to be moments during the year where there\u2019s going to be small bits of tension but that\u2019s because we\u2019re fierce competitors within the same team. \u201cYou\u2019re conflicted constantly because you\u2019re team-mates and you\u2019re team-mates trying to get the team to win, but you also want to win yourself. But I think we managed it well. I think at points last year we particularly managed it well and I think at the end we managed it really well. And this year we\u2019ll do it better.\u201d And by the end of the season, one senses, Hamilton, artist, lyricist and museum-maker, will have another shelf of trophies to display."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
