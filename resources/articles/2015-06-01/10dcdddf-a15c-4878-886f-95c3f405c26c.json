The health secretary is introducing curbs on the use of employment agencies, some of which he says are \u201cripping off\u201d the NHS by charging \u201cextortionate\u201d rates. He has acted after the annual bill for agency staff rose from \u00a31.8bn to \u00a33.3bn over the past three years. Hospital trusts, forced to improve quality of care since the Mid Staffs scandal, have sought to hire extra staff, but many have had difficulty attracting enough extra personnel and have increasingly relied on agency personnel to fill their rotas. New rules will introduce a maximum hourly rate that agencies can charge for a stand-in doctor or nurse\u2019s services and cap the amount that any trust in financial trouble can spend on them. Trusts will also be banned from using agencies that are not on a new approved list. \u201cExpensive staffing agencies are quite simply ripping off the NHS. It\u2019s outrageous that taxpayers are being taken for a ride by companies charging up to \u00a33,500 a shift for a doctor\u201d, said Hunt. \u201cThe NHS is bigger than all of these companies, so we\u2019ll use our bargaining power to drive down rates and beat them at their own game.\u201d Hunt\u2019s move was widely welcomed as a way of tackling the NHS\u2019s growing financial problems and helping it deliver \u00a322bn of efficiency savings by 2020. Hospital bosses have become increasingly frustrated by what they see as agencies exploiting the NHS\u2019s staffing problems. Some trusts have as many as 25% fewer nurses than the number they believe they need to deliver safe, high-quality care. However, some experts raised doubts about how Hunt\u2019s initiative would work, given the health service\u2019s chronic lack of many types of staff, including nurses, GPs, A&amp;E doctors and radiologists. Candace Imison, director of healthcare systems at the Nuffield Trust health thinktank, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the rising agency bill is an issue for hospitals up and down the country. But a cap on individual hospital trusts\u2019 agency staff spending could put them between a rock and a hard place if they cannot meet minimum safe staffing levels without these workers.\u201d Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: \u201cPatient safety must always come first, so any plans for a cap on spending must ensure that it does not prevent trusts from providing safe staffing levels when there are no alternatives.\u201d Reducing nurse training places was a \u201creckless and short-sighted\u201d attempt to save money, he added. Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association, said the NHS\u2019s greater reliance on agency staff \u201cis a sign of stress on the system and the result of poor workforce planning by government\u201d. Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, said mistakes by the Conservatives had led to the expanded use of agency staff. \u201cJeremy Hunt is trying to pull the wool over people\u2019s eyes by acting as if the \u00a33.3bn agency bill is a problem he has suddenly discovered,\u201d he said. \u201cThe decision to cut 6,000 nursing posts in the early years of the last parliament, alongside big reductions in nurse training places, has left the NHS in the grip of private staffing agencies.\u201d NHS Employers said that hospitals would continue to need to recruit permanent staff from abroad to fill vacancies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
