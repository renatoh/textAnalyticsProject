Good to see such superb names as Kate McGrath, director of theatre producers Fuel, and Emma Stenning, executive director of the Bristol Old Vic chosen. But there are some significant omissions: I'll also be \"watching\" such women as Kathleen Soriano, who has taken over from Norman Rosenthal as exhibitions secretary at the Royal Academy of Arts; inspired curator Polly Staple, director of the Chisenhale Gallery in London; and Jackie Wylie, the young creator of an interesting programme at Glasgow venue the Arches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
