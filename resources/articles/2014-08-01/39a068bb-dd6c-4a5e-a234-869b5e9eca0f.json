He won the Secretariat Stakes on Adelaide and the Beverly D on Euro Charline as European raiders enjoyed a successful night, though they came up short in the Arlington Million itself. Adelaide, a runner-up behind Eagle Top at Royal Ascot when last seen in Britain, was sent off the 11-10 favourite for the Secretariat and came home a convincing winner by a length and a half. He gave his trainer, Aidan O\u2019Brien, a third success in the race. Moore won the Beverly D for the second year in a row, having landed it on Dank 12 months ago. This time he came with an irresistible run down the home stretch aboard Euro Charline, from Marco Botti\u2019s Newmarket yard, holding off the US favourite, Stephanie\u2019s Kitten, who was partnered by Frankie Dettori. Just The Judge, another English raider, trained by Charlie Hills, was third. Earlier, Botti\u2019s Dandino had been second in the American St Leger. Those wins raised hopes for O\u2019Brien\u2019s Magician in the Million and he looked the winner when taking the lead early in the straight but he was overwhelmed close home by the rank outsider Hardest Core, trained in the US by Edward Graham. Side Glance, from the Kingsclere yard of Andrew Balding, stayed on to be third in the race for the second time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
