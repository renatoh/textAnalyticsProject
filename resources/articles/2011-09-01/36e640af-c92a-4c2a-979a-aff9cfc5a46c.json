Urbanisation, suburbanisation, the decline of organised religion, the rise of the welfare state \u2013 these and other factors have contributed to the breakdown of social structures. Even the triumph of romantic love, which seemed to promise connectedness, has ended up having the opposite effect, creating narrow, nuclear relationships that exclude wider families. Technological breakthroughs, which ought to link us, isolate us even more. We lurk in bedrooms on Facebook Chat; on buses, we text, oblivious to the people around us, who are themselves enclosed in the sonic cocoon of their iPod playlists. This isolation, which is absolutely modern, confounds and contradicts our nature as social animals. Yet we are still possessed by the need to belong, and crave acceptance by others; we still long for peer approval. Our ideas of what constitutes good and bad behaviour remain defined by the behaviour of those around us. In other words, we are susceptible to peer pressure \u2013 and this, Tina Rosenbergargues in her thought-provoking new book, is something we should be making every effort to exploit in order to cure social ills. What if peer pressure were harnessed for good? Her big idea is that society can be improved by creating groups that make it easy to do the right thing, because others are doing it too. These groups can be especially powerful if the adman's skill is applied to making them alluring. The author begins with an exercise in rebranding. Too often, she says, the phrase \"peer pressure\" is used negatively. So she stops talking of \"peer pressure\" and starts referring to \"the social cure\". This is her take-home phrase, her \"black swan\" or \"tipping point\". (It's a missed trick that she didn't make it the title of her book.) Then, to illustrate how her social cure can work \u2013 like a kind of positive contagion \u2013 she presents us with a pageant of examples. First the anti-smoking campaign. When the Surgeon General's report on the lethal effects of smoking was published back in 1964, health officials thought their job was done. Not a bit of it. As Rosenberg explains, people overwhelmingly start smoking in their teens, and telling teenagers that the habit is going to kill them only makes it seem cooler. That is why people start smoking. Not because it's addictive \u2013 that's merely why they continue smoking \u2013 but because it seems cool. To prevent people from starting to smoke, the key is to make not-smoking seem an even cooler lifestyle choice. Which is precisely what campaigners managed to achieve in the late Nineties in California, Florida and elsewhere. Presenting smokers as puppets of the tobacco industry, associations of hip young non-smokers with names such as Rebel and Rage Against The Haze used advertising techniques to recast the conflict as a fight between youth and truth on the one hand, and the megalithic tobacco companies on the other. The result was that in Florida, for instance, the rate of teen smoking was halved in less than a decade. Second example: the fall of Slobodan Milosevic in Serbia in 2000, which was accelerated by the subversive machinations of the activist group Otpor. Its members plastered walls and telegraph poles with their iconic symbol of a clenched fist (itself sending up the authoritarianism of the regime) to give the impression that there were more of them than there actually were. They staged witty events designed to mock the police. After a magazine's offices had been raided, Otpor activists responded by ostentatiously carrying in large cardboard boxes, apparently filled with replacement supplies. When the police arrested them, the boxes turned out to be empty \u2013 which made the officers look heavy-handed, and, more importantly, foolish. What Rosenberg doesn't do, because she can't, is prove the extent to which Otpor was responsible for ousting Milosevic (pictured). Nor can she separate how much it depended on the attractions of belonging to the activist group, and how much on the marketing-inspired strategies of its leaders. A similar point could be made about the anti-smoking campaign. Could the same effects have been achieved by, say, a handful of adverts cooked up by a marketing team, presenting smokers as slaves to capitalism? And to what extent has the decline in smoking in many countries been accelerated by accidental developments: by the fact that, for example, with the rise of mobile phones, teenagers now have something to do with their hands other than manipulate a Marlboro Light? Yet it's hard not to be seduced by Join the Club. Whether writing about healthcare in India or study habits in American universities, Rosenberg expresses herself with admirable clarity and concision. I doubt this book will achieve the same success as some of the psychosocial studies that have topped the bestseller lists in recent years \u2013 it doesn't have quite the simplicity, perhaps, or the pub-chat appeal of their central arguments. But it should nonetheless be applauded, and pressed into the hands of preachers and politicians, schoolteachers and public health campaigners."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
