Knox, now 31, was twice convicted and twice acquitted of killing Kercher, 21, in the home they shared in the Italian university town of Perugia in November 2007. She returned to Italy this week for the first time since being released from prison in 2011, to participate in a debate entitled \u201cTrial by Media\u201d at the Criminal Justice festival in Modena. Earlier this week, the Kerchers\u2019 lawyer, Francesco Maresca, said Knox\u2019s public appearances were painful for the family. \u201cAll these insistences and appearances are only ever done to keep the attention on herself,\u201d Maresca said. \u201cThe murder is a tragic memory for the Kercher family. They lost their daughter and sister in such a terrible way. It\u2019s also an injustice for them as they still don\u2019t know the full truth.\u201d He said Knox\u2019s return to Italy and involvement in the conference was inappropriate, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s unjustified because her process was not a classic case of \u2018judicial error\u2019. There was a swing in the decisions: some judges decided one way, and others in another way.\u201d Knox, who had always declared her innocence, spoke about the moment she was found guilty for the first time and sentenced to 26 years in jail in 2009. \u201cMy innocence didn\u2019t save me because the media created a story \u2026 and people liked that story,\u201d she told a packed room on Saturday. \u201cI was the dirty man-eater, Foxy Knoxy.\u201d She accused the media of producing \u201cclickbait\u201d stories while she was imprisoned instead of examining the evidence of the case. She also spoke about her family being tormented by the press. \u201cI wasn\u2019t innocent until proven guilty, I was a wise, drugged-up whore \u2013 it was unfounded but it awoke people\u2019s imagination. These sensational and defamatory images also entered the courtroom. The investigation was contaminated and the jury corrupted. It was impossible for me to have a fair trial.\u201d Knox added: \u201cOn 1 November 2007 the robber Rudy Guede entered the house and raped and killed my housemate Meredith. His DNA was left and then he escaped the country. He was tried and convicted. But despite all the attention [on the case] hardly anyone heard of the name Rudy Guede, because all of the focus was on me.\u201d The body of Kercher, a student from Coulsdon, Surrey, who was in Italy on an Erasmus programme, was found under a duvet in her bedroom, partly undressed with multiple stab wounds. Knox and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, spent four years in prison after initially being convicted of the murder. For Knox, three of those years were for a defamation conviction after she wrongly accused Patrick Lumumba, a bar owner, of the crime. Lumumba spent two weeks in jail and was released after someone came forward with an alibi for him. Knox had told investigators that she \u201ccovered her ears as he [Lumumba] killed\u201d. She later said she had made the allegation under police coercion. On Saturday she said she had retracted the accusation hours after making it, but had been ignored by the police. \u201cThey arrested Patrick, Raffaele and I,\u201d she said. \u201cThe next day they organised a press conference to say that the case is closed.\u201d Carlo Pacelli, the lawyer who represented Lumumba, told the Observer his client had not received any compensation over the defamation. \u201cPatrick was the victim of slander [by] Amanda Knox and for this she was given a three-year term for accusing a man she knew was innocent,\u201d Pacelli said. \u201cShe also never apologised to him,\u201d he claimed. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful.\u201d Knox and Sollecito were acquitted in 2011 before being convicted again in 2014 by the Florence appeals court, which ruled that the extent of the injuries inflicted on Kercher was such that Guede, the Ivorian man serving time for the murder, could not have acted alone. Italy\u2019s highest court quashed the convictions in a definitive ruling in 2015 because of \u201cstunning flaws\u201d in the investigation. Italy Innocence Project, the event organiser, has been criticised for inviting Knox to take part. \u201cShe was invited as she is an icon of trial by media,\u201d said Guido Sola, a lawyer with the organisation. \u201cKnox is a free person who is speaking about being slammed on the front pages and having her privacy violated.\u201d Knox described Kercher as a \u201cbrilliant girl\u201d whose friendship she had enjoyed for \u201ca very short time\u201d, and expressed her condolences to the family. The Kercher family rarely respond to the publicity generated by Knox, who reportedly earned \u00a33.5m for her memoir, took part in a Netflix documentary about the case in 2016 and has been the subject of other books and films. \u201cNo system is perfect and this case wasn\u2019t perfectly done,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a lot of confusion and the Kercher family had to live with this anxiety \u2026 with false information \u2026 I am sorry for them. But the assassin is in jail.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
