Yet, as Sen points out, at the same time, the quiet presence of endemic hunger - perhaps the cause of slow death or incapacitation of many more millions - does not usually make headlines. Sen, who was Drummond professor of political economy at Oxford for many years before crossing the waters to Harvard, was already writing about the power of the free press to influence public discourse and affect the human condition a quarter of a century ago. The study of journalism as an integral part of academia has now arrived at Oxford. The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, which opens today, is taking the lead on a distinctly different journey from the courses and schools of journalism which abound in universities in the US and which have begun to find a place in curricula in the UK. The institute does not train students to become journalists. Rather, it creates a partnership between academics and journalists to study the content of journalism, in an international, comparative framework. This partnership was evident from the inception of the idea of the institute, as leading thinkers from both inside Oxford and the world of journalism came together to bring about its creation. Oxford academics, such as Professor Timothy Garton Ash, found common cause with journalists - notably John Lloyd, contributing editor of the Financial Times. There was vital support from the chancellor of Oxford University, Lord Patten, and the vice-chancellor, John Hood, who asked Tim Gardam, former director of television of Channel 4 and principal of St Anne's College, to chair a working group to advise on the institute's creation. Reuters, which has supported a programme for visiting international journalists at Green College in Oxford for more than 20 years, became the founding sponsor with a \u00a31.75m commitment over five years. The institute, of which I am director, is thus the result of a partnership between a global news agency with a reputation for dispassionate dissemination of accurate information and a historic institution of learning of international renown. Based in the department of politics and international relations, the institute aims to build on the strength of all the major disciplines at Oxford, including politics, economics, business, history, law, philosophy, medicine and the sciences, and it is also building collaborative relationships with the university's many regional centres. Its focus is news media and it has identified a few substantive areas in which to concentrate its research and activities in the initial years: a critical assessment of the actual exercise of freedom and the responsibilities of democratic governance by the media in established open societies, such as the US, western Europe and India; an examination of the evolution of media in societies moving from controlled to relatively free media; problems in the reporting of news in science and medicine and how to address them; issues in business and economic journalism; and the global representation of religious faith. As a research centre of excellence, the institute will be studying issues of contemporary relevance to the world of practice. It will host research projects and applied research and academic seminars as well as talks and debates on topical issues. Its output will be a combination of academic dissemination, in the form of books, journal articles and working papers, as well as media commentary worldwide and interactive discussions and blogs. It is uniquely positioned to combine the depth of knowledge and academic rigour of Oxford University with policy relevance to the world of journalism. Its research agenda, related activities (such as seminars, conferences, lectures and publications), its people - all reflect its aim to be analytically rigorous, international and comparative in its study of the content of news media, with a view to influencing public discourse, and ultimately policy, through the advancement of knowledge. The institute's opening event tonight gives a taste of its aims and agenda. Presided over by Lord Patten, the event brings together Len Downie, executive editor of the Washington Post, as keynote speaker, with the director general of al-Jazeera, Wadah Khanfar, the BBC's director of news, Helen Boaden, and Professor Garton Ash, on the subject of journalism after Iraq. \u00b7 The opening event in Oxford will be webcast at www.reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
