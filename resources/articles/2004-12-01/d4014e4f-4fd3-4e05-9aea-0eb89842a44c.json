Calls for the chancellor to ease the cost of buying properties at the lower end of the market have come from all sides. Currently, homebuyers paying more than \u00a360,000 have to stump up 1% of the property's value in stamp duty. On a property over \u00a3250,000 that rises to 3% and for properties worth \u00a3500,000 or more there is a 4% levy. Peter Bolton King, chief executive of the National Association of Estate agents, said: \"Stamp duty was never meant to be an all-encompassing property tax, but with the chancellor's refusal to adjust the scale, one can't help wondering whether he is beginning to look on it as a contribution to the shortage in his spending. \"House prices have risen by around 150% since the \u00a360,000 threshold for stamp duty was set over a decade ago. According to the government's own figures, the average cost of a home in the UK is now \u00a3155,627 (Office of the Deputy Prime Minister) - meaning that practically every homebuyer is now liable for this tax.\" David Bitner, head of product operations at Bradford &amp; Bingley, said that a mixture of high prices and steep stamp duty was keeping first-time buyers out of the market. \"We think the stamp duty tiers should be restructured to reflect current market conditions and offer some help to dispirited borrowers struggling to buy their first home,\" he said. It has been rumoured that Gordon Brown will announce an increase in the threshold on stamp duty in tomorrow's pre-budget report in an effort to boost a flagging property market."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
