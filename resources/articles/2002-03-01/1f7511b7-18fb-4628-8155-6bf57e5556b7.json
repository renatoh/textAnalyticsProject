Chris Smith, the former Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, will become the most prominent Labour figure so far to question Downing Street's policy to back America's war against Iraq, even if it means military invasion. His comments come amid growing signs of discontent about Blair's 'presidential' style and suggestions that he could face a leadership challenge. 'I think a lot of my colleagues, including myself, would be worried if there were something being contemplated which was an all-out invasion of Iraq, simply going on the coat tails of an American unilateral decision,' Smith will tell GMTV's Sunday Programme. 'I don't think that would be something that any of us would be particularly happy about.' Donald Anderson, the highly respected chairman of the Defence Select Committee, will tell the same programme that the international legal basis for such an attack is 'pretty shaky'. Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, is likely to stir up opposition once again when he hardens his anti-Iraqi rhetoric in a speech tomorrow. He will say that it is time to 'push back the boundaries of chaos' around the world and that, when it comes to action against Iraq, the world 'must not be found wanting'. The criticism is part of a concerted backlash against Blair's leadership style from Labour backbenchers worried that a series of rows over foreign affairs and public service reform have left his Government looking vulnerable. Although a number of senior Labour Party figures spoken to by The Observer yesterday described reports of a leadership challenge as 'fanciful' and 'absurd', many admitted that Blair had lost the confidence of many in the party because of a perception that he is autocratic. 'The sheen has gone off Blair's Teflon,' said Jeremy Corbyn, a leading left-winger in the party. Another well-known critic, Ian Davidson, Labour MP for Glasgow Pollock, also said that Blair had to listen to the views of the party and trade unions more. 'The dangers of isolation for Number 10 is that they start operating in a sort of parallel universe,' he will tell BBC1's On the Record programme today. 'Tony Blair will not be Prime Minister for ever. No doubt he is considering what his future will be but I don't think he's likely to go by the end of the week.' Davidson said he was considering relaunching the Tribune group, the once-powerful club of Labour MPs, which could become a focus for dissent. Peter Kilfoyle, writing in today's Observer , also reflected growing levels of disquiet. 'In the case of Tony Blair, events appear to be conspiring to confound his propensity for political providence,' the former Defence Minister said. 'There are political storms ahead, on issues as varied as the euro, political funding, Iraq and, most critically, delivery on public services. 'Much responsibility for the Government's downward slide in recent opinion polls lies with increased disenchantment with its ability to inspire both old and new supporters with a fruitful application of a vision for the future.' Blair did receive qualified backing from a surprising quarter. Lord Hattersley, the former deputy leader of the Labour Party and a vocal critic of the Blairite project, said there were signs that the Prime Minister was starting to listen. 'Reality has broken in,' he said. 'You cannot improve the health service or any public service without the support of the public service workers who are in that service.' Hattersley described talk of a leadership challenge as 'absurd'. 'It is the kind of thing that would not be discussed by anyone of judgment or influence.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
