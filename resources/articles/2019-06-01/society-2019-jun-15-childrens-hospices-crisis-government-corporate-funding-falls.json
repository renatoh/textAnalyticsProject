Shooting Star Children\u2019s Hospices, which runs two children\u2019s hospices in the south-east, will stop offering respite care from November to half the 500 local families who need it. \u201cWe are going to focus the majority of our respite care on the 250 children we have identified with the shortest prognosis,\u201d said the chief executive, Nigel Harding. The charity has had a 25% real- terms cut in its government funding since 2008, he said, and has been eating into its reserves since 2012. \u201cHaving to not offer services that we know are vital to really vulnerable families is very difficult for me and my staff. Respite care is a lifeline for these families. It gives parents a break. There is a chance that, without it, families will be torn apart.\u201d The campaigning charity Together for Short Lives will publish a report this week criticising the government for quietly reneging on its promise last December to increase its annual grant to children\u2019s hospices to \u00a325m. Children\u2019s hospices in England, the report will say, now face a \u00a313m funding gap because the government has repeatedly failed to increase funding when medical treatments advance. The charity\u2019s chief executive, Andy Fletcher, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s contribution hasn\u2019t kept pace with the cost of delivering hospice care. Children with life-limiting illnesses are living longer because we\u2019re better at diagnosing and treating their conditions.\u201d He confirmed that children\u2019s hospices nationwide are facing a \u201cvery, very challenging\u201d funding crisis, adding that the majority are looking closely at what services they can cut this year. Stephanie Nimmo\u2019s daughter, Daisy, was born prematurely with a rare genetic mutation that damaged her brain and intestines. She couldn\u2019t eat and needed complex care 24 hours a day. Respite care from Shooting Star Children\u2019s Hospices allowed Nimmo to catch up on sleep, spend time with her three other young children, and after her husband was diagnosed with terminal cancer care for him, too. She said: \u201cOur family dynamic fell apart. It was horrific. If the hospice hadn\u2019t looked after Daisy for me when [my husband] was dying, I don\u2019t know what I would have done.\u201d Daisy died, aged 12, shortly after her father. The Birmingham-based Acorns Children\u2019s Hospice announced this month that it was shutting its Walsall branch after 20 years of helping more than 200 children with life-limiting illnesses. Harding is calling on the government to increase its annual grant to children\u2019s hospices, and said if the cuts he makes this year are not enough next year Shooting Star would also be forced to consider closing a hospice. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just affecting us. This is a national issue. There\u2019s a crisis in the sector that\u2019s been heading down the tracks for some time.\u201d Corporate donations to medium-sized charities such as Shooting Star Children\u2019s Hospices have fallen by more than \u00a3250,000 a year as companies \u201csit on their hands, waiting for Brexit and saving their cash,\u201d he said. The charity receives government funding of less than \u00a3700,000 a year, a sum that has gone up by just \u00a340,000 in 11 years, and must raise more than \u00a310m of funding from donations. It made 12 staff redundant last year and Harding would not rule out further redundancies: \u201cQuite honestly, I don\u2019t know what the future holds for us.\u201d For Harding, hearing candidates in the Conservative leadership talk about tax cuts was the last straw. \u201cIf they can fund tax cuts, what about the dying? Our society is judged by the way it treats its most vulnerable. Who is more vulnerable than children with life-limiting illnesses and severe disabilities?\u201d Last month, he wrote to all the MPs in his catchment area, including Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, John McDonnell and Philip Hammond, warning them about the cuts at the hospice. Only Vince Cable and the Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh replied. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cHospices have always been part-funded by local NHS organisations, and local areas are responsible for ensuring services they commission meet the needs of their communities. The NHS long-term plan prioritises improvements in children\u2019s palliative care, and the NHS has committed to increase funding for these services, including hospices, by up to \u00a37m a year.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
