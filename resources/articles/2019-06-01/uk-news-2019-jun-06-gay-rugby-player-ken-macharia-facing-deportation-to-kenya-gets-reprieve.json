Ken Macharia, a member of Bristol Bisons gay and inclusive rugby club, had expected to be detained when he reported to a police station in Somerset on Thursday. A dozen fellow club members, wearing their distinctive pink and black shirts, walked with him into the police station in Bridgwater chanting: \u201cBisons! Bisons!\u201d as a sound system blasted out Gloria Gaynor\u2019s anthem I Am What I Am. Macharia, who has lived in the UK for nine years, and whose mother lives in Bristol, was allowed to leave the police station but faces being detained at any moment after a fresh claim for asylum was rejected earlier this week. The 39-year-old expressed relief and said he was looking forward to returning to his home in Somerset. He said: \u201cI\u2019m relieved and happy to be going home. I\u2019m looking forward to having a rest. It\u2019s been a very stressful time. But I don\u2019t have permission to stay in the UK and my position is very precarious.\u201d By the time he arrived at Bridgwater police station, more than 150,000 people had signed a petition calling for Macharia to be allowed to stay in the UK and more than \u00a310,000 had been raised towards legal fees that he hopes will allow him to take his case to judicial review. Macharia is struggling to understand why the British government apparently accepts that gay people are at risk of persecution in Kenya but is intent on sending him there. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d he said. \u201cSame-sex intimacy in Kenya is illegal. Police harass and blackmail gay people. There is a risk of mob violence. There is discrimination with people being fired from work and evicted by landlords. I don\u2019t understand the Home Office\u2019s stance. \u201cI\u2019ve been here more than nine years, my home is here. I have a great group of friends who sacrifice a lot for me. I can be who I am in the UK. I don\u2019t have to hide my sexuality. England is the best place for me, especially Bristol.\u201d The high-profile nature of the campaign to keep him in the UK makes returning even more difficult, he argues. \u201cLiving in a closeted life is no longer an option for me. I don\u2019t know what I could do.\u201d Macharia has been a member of the Bisons club for more than three years. He cannot join them at a tournament they are playing in this weekend in Dublin because he fears he would not be allowed back into the UK. Club captain Murray Jones said the fight would go on. \u201cKen\u2019s still very much at risk of being sent to Kenya, which is not his home. He could be arrested at any time, taken to Heathrow and flown to Kenya. That must not happen. He\u2019s part of our team and part of our community.\u201d Murray said it was \u201cdisgusting\u201d that the rainbow flag was prominent on the Home Office\u2019s Twitter feed when it was acting as it was towards Macharia. \u201cThe UK should be at the forefront of LGBT rights. If we led, others would follow,\u201d he said. A Home Office decision letter sent to Macharia\u2019s solicitor acknowledged that gay sex in Kenya was punishable by up to 21 years in prison and that LGBT people have reportedly been subjected to harassment, blackmail and rape. However, the letter added: \u201cWhilst same-sexual activity between men has been criminalised with a penalty of up to 21 years in prison this law is rarely applied and the objective evidence does not establish that LGBT persons are likely to be subjected to persecution or serious harm.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThis government has a proud record of providing protection for asylum seekers fleeing persecution because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. All decisions on claims based on sexual orientation are subject to an additional safeguard and reviewed by a second experienced caseworker. We cannot comment on an individual case whilst there is ongoing legal action.\u201d The Home Office\u2019s decision comes after Kenya\u2019s high court last month upheld laws that criminalise gay sex in what was described by a campaigner as a \u201ca sad day for the rule of law and human rights\u201d.
