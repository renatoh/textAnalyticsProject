O'Donnell, who never regained consciousness after collapsing on the Fir Park pitch when his team, Motherwell, were on course to defeat Dundee United, was only 35, but his combination of football skills and personal qualities ensured that anyone who encountered him will remember him fondly. Injury robbed the midfielder of an opportunity to fulfil his potential after shooting to national prominence as a 19-year-old with a goal in Motherwell's Scottish Cup final triumph over Dundee United in 1991, but O'Donnell's character was never in question. He was a man who held principles, courtesy and family values as life's most valuable attributes. His colleague Tom Boyd, the former Motherwell and Celtic captain, said: \"He was just a very nice guy. A gentleman, a family man and a very talented footballer.\" O'Donnell was born in Bellshill, a bus ride from Fir Park. A pupil at Holy Cross school, Hamilton, it was clear from a young age that O'Donnell was destined for the football field; he made his Motherwell first-team debut aged 17 and, alongside that Scottish Cup winners' medal, was twice the country's Professional Footballers' Association's young player of the year. He won his sole Scotland cap in 1994, against Switzerland, with the international manager of the time, Craig Brown, remarking since that further honours would doubtless have followed, but for injury. Celtic had paid \u00a31.75m in the same year to sign the left-footed midfielder, who always played the game in the correct manner, without any form of malice: he was never sent off in his senior career. A five-year spell at Celtic, which returned another Scottish Cup and a league's winners' medal in the course of 100 matches, was plagued by injury, and he endured similar ill-luck in making only 20 appearances for Sheffield Wednesday between 1999 and 2003. Those who feared O'Donnell's career was destined to wind down before it had ever blossomed knew little of the Lanarkshire man's inner strength. Terry Butcher, the Motherwell manager, offered O'Donnell training facilities, and it was soon apparent that Butcher could usefully make the stay more permanent. O'Donnell's second debut came in January 2004, in another club victory over Dundee United; in 2006 he was appointed the team's captain by Butcher's successor, Maurice Malpas; and this season, under the management of Mark McGhee, he returned his finest performances in a decade as his team lit up the early months of the Scottish Premier League season. \"I have missed too many games in the middle of my career to stop playing at the age of 35,\" said O'Donnell recently; such appetite was characteristic. One of the many cruel aspects of his sudden death is that his nephew, David Clarkson, was on the pitch with him. \"If he [Clarkson] continues to progress the way he has then he has a great future,\" said O'Donnell of his nephew in 2004. \"Hopefully, I can play next to him even more.\" But it was not to be. He had two other nephews in the game: the St Mirren midfielder Stephen O'Donnell and the former Motherwell player Brian Dempsey. O'Donnell is survived by his wife Eileen and four children. \u00b7 Philip O'Donnell, footballer, born March 25 1972; died December 29 2007"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
