No players were bought. No players were sold. But didn't East End Arry have a bubble bath (ie: laugh) trying! First off, he decided that Manchester City's \u00a33.7m offer for Steve Lomas was \"very reasonable\" and accepted it on the spot - even though a tearful Lomas yesterday told him: \"I'm settled here and have never asked for a transfer. I am more than happy to be at West Ham and proud to play for them.\" So at 11.11am, Lomas was off to talk to City. Or at least he was until 11.12am, when Arry accepted a bid from Everton as well. But by 3pm, Arry had decided Lomas was staying put, saying without a hint of irony: \"I had a chat with Steve and I really want to keep him here.\" And that wasn't all, because Redknapp then revealed that while he'd given up trying to sign Gareth Southgate - \"I don't think I'm going to get anywhere near getting Gareth. \u00a310m is not feasible for us. He's a good player but it's a lot of money for a 30-year-old\" - he still had his eye on Rangers' accident-prone defender Lorenzo Amoruso. \"The deal is on with Rangers - it's just whether Amoruso fancies it and we can do a deal with him,\" Arry chirped, before whistling breezily that he \"wouldn't have a clue what he's looking for in personal terms until we sit down and have a chat with him\". However, Teamtalk tell a different story. They say that West Ham have offered Amoruso a signing-on fee of \u00a3750,000 plus \u00a320,000-a-week. Sadly, Amoruso wants a \u00a32m signing on fee plus \u00a325,000-a-week - a figure that East End Arry is baulking at. Even so, he remains confident that someone will be turning up soon. \"I think Monday or Tuesday next week I'll get a player or two in,\" said Arry, who is beginning to make Barry Fry sound tight. FOWLER TIME Tick tock ... tick tock ... tick tock ... do you like our fancy watch? Yes, it is rather special isn't it? We suppose you're wondering why the face is cracked with bits falling off it. Well, that's because it's the Fiver's patented Robbie Fowler Inevitable Transfer Countdown Timepiece. It doesn't work quite as well as it used to, but it's still does a basic job. Mind you, the hands are guaranteed to start turning like the clappers whenever someone interviews Gerard Houllier about the recent unprovoked attack on Fowler, or Chelsea's renewed \u00a314m interest in the striker in the wake of Jari Litmanen's arrival at Anfield ... whirl ... whirl ... whirl ... listen, the Liverpool manager must be talking to someone! \"It was not the best time to be where he was, and he will acknowledge that\" ... spin ... spin ... spin ... \"To be honest maybe it wasn't the best thing to be where he was at that time but we have to remember that it was a very nasty, unprovoked attack which is very sad in modern society\" ... wheech ... wheech ... wheech ... \"It could have happened to any of our players, it could have happened to me, and we must really avoid that sort of incident in the future\" ... revolve ... revolve ... revolve ... \"I don't know what [Chelsea] will do now\" ... turn ... turn ... turn ... \"It was a coincidence that Jari has arrived when this has unfortunate incident has happened to Robbie. You don't prepare a transfer overnight!\" ... hurtle ... hurtle ... hurtle ... \"I have always said I want four strikers and I won't change my mind. What we want is to keep the four strikers\" ... swirl ... swirl ... bbrrrrrraaannnngggggggggggg! Ah, there goes the alarm. We give it until the end of the season, then. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"The guy had actually said that he had lots of pain in his groin and guts because I kicked him there, which was unbelievable to hear. I got him on the left side of his bottom, but I hardly touched him to be honest. If I wanted to kick him he would still be lying there. It seems incredible that the police were not there to protect the game and the players from these crazy streakers - and then they come to question me!\" - Igor Stimac shudders while remembering West Ham's trip to Walsall in the Worthington Cup last September. The streaker ended up with a \u00a350 fine, while the charges against Stimac were dropped. SOL WHINE \"I'm happy, I'm willing and I'm here to do business!\" These may sound like the words of a drunk, dandruff-ridden executive stumbling around an \"exclusive\" Amsterdam \"club\" with tenners sticking from the flap in his Y-fronts. But they're not. In fact, they belong to one the most loyal footballers in the Premiership: namely, Sol \"Spurs isn't my middle name, 'Spurs is my middle name' is my middle name\" Campbell. All poor Sol wants to do is sign a contract with Spurs. But, cruelly, he is unable to fulfil his dream because he isn't being offered enough cash to do so. \"It hurts. In a way I am not selfish in that I want the club to do well rather than worrying about a contract and money,\" his totally non-contradictory explanation began. \"It means so much to me to do well for Tottenham, rather than go somewhere else. I'm happy here but there's a lot of things to sort out off the field.\" Luckily for everyone concerned, Sol is a generous sort. \"Some clubs have their own reasons to be like that but for me I love the game of football and I just want to keep on playing football for Tottenham,\" he dreamed, before getting down to brass tacks. \"I have put my cards down and now they have to make their move.\" The Fiver, for one, hopes Spurs do the right thing by the poor lad. After all, how will he feel if he is forced to sign a much more lucrative deal with Manchester United? Or Arsenal? Or Fulham? We shudder to think. THE RUMOUR MILL Blackburn are hoping to sign Julian Maidena and Luis Enrique Rueda from Argentinian club Talleres, according to Planet Football. The battle for the signature of Italian midfield sensation Antonio Cassano is on. Manchester United have joined AC Milan, Juventus and Roma in a \u00a320m chase for the 18-year-old Bari player. NEWS IN BRIEF Corinthians midfielder Edu will leave for London today - with his valid passport - to complete a \u00a35.9m move to Arsenal. Aston Villa are confident that the signing of Juan Pablo Angel will go ahead, despite newspaper reports that Angel's agent Gustavo Muscardi is demanding \u00a3800,000 in commission. Villa spokesman Phil Mepham said: \"There is no hitch. Plans are in hand for him to come over here to complete his medical and formally complete the signing. There is no undue delay.\" Former Argentina manager Carlos Bilardo wants Diego Maradona to be his running mate when he bids for the Argentina presidency in 2003. \"Diego can do any job that is asked of him,\" he said. \"He knows people better than anyone else. If he says someone is a bad egg, you can be sure he is absolutely spot on. When Diego speaks you have to take notice and that's why I'd like to have him at my side as a politician.\" Alan Kelly has had a transfer request accepted by Blackburn. Morton have failed in an attempt to lure Ally McCoist on loan. Kilmarnock fear McCoist may be needed for their Scottish Cup tie at the end of the month. Elgin have been forced to postpone their Scottish Cup second-round tie against Queen of the South tomorrow because of a frozen pitch. The game will be played on January 13 instead.
