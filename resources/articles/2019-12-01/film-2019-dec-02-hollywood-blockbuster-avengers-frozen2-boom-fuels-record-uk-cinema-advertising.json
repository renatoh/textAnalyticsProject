Seven films have taken more than $1bn (\u00a3770m) at the global box office so far this year \u2013 Avengers: Endgame, The Lion King, Spider-Man: Far from Home, Captain Marvel, Toy Story 4, Aladdin and Joker \u2013 resulting in an advertising bonanza as brands look to cash in on movie fans packing out cinemas. With two more films still likely to join the $1bn club \u2013 record-breaking Frozen 2 and the upcoming Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker \u2013 analysts are significantly upping forecasts for this year\u2019s UK cinema advertising spend. \u201cThe film slate has been so strong and the only place to watch a Frozen 2 or Star Wars is in cinemas for the first 16 weeks from when they premiere,\u201d says Karen Stacey, the chief executive of Digital Cinema Media (DCM), which sells advertising representing 80% of the UK movie market. \u201cThat exclusive window can\u2019t be replicated and if an advertiser wants to be involved in the buzz they have to be in cinemas.\u201d DCM is predicting it will see a record-breaking year for cinema advertising revenues, with ad sales growth up double digits. The advertising bonanza is being driven by big spenders led by Apple, McDonald\u2019s, Sky, Samsung and Amazon. GroupM, the media arm of advertising giant WPP, has significantly increased its forecast for growth in UK cinema advertising spend this year, forecasting that it will break the \u00a3200m mark. The company has upped its summer forecast of just 1% annual growth to 9% in its winter forecast, published on Monday. Cinema will register the biggest rate of growth of all traditional media in the UK this year \u2013 outpacing TV, radio and outdoor advertising \u2013 with only internet ad spend forecast to grow faster. The UK film industry is enjoying a boost in profile among advertisers after last year recording the highest admission numbers since 1970. \u201cLast year was such a good one that there has definitely been a halo effect for brands thinking about cinema, advertisers upping spend as well as attracting new or lapsed advertisers,\u201d says Anna Cremin, head of research and consumer insight at cinema advertising firm Pearl &amp; Dean. Cremin cites research that estimates in 2019 there have so far been 174 advertisers that are either first-time cinema advertisers or have not run a campaign in movie theatres since 2015. Cinema-going is fuelled by younger demographics with 16- to 34-year-olds accounting for almost half of the 177m tickets sold in the UK last year. The huge success of blockbusters with particular appeal to younger audiences such as Avengers: Endgame, which has become the biggest film of all time, passing Avatar with a global box office take of $2.79bn, are doing the business for the cinema industry again this year. Cinema owners have also been investing heavily \u2013 from special effects in blockbuster movies to leather reclining seats, sofas and restaurant menus \u2013 to keep the movie-going experience attractive in the age of the stay-at-home lure of Netflix. \u201cIt is about giving a complete evening out,\u201d says Crispin Lilly, chief executive of Everyman cinemas. \u201cIn the digital age there are times people are craving experience, social interaction and escape. Digital switch-off is becoming increasingly rare, cinema provides that.\u201d By the end of 2019, Everyman will have opened in 23 new locations in the last five years. Its admissions were up 9.4% to 1.4m in the first half. Lilly added there is scope to open in six to seven new locations a year for the forseeable future. The cinema industry is also selling itself as a \u201csafe haven\u201d for advertisers, who are becoming increasingly wary about the type of inappropriate content their ads can end up appearing next to in campaigns online, such as on Facebook and YouTube. \u201cThe context in which ads appears always matters and being brand safe matters,\u201d said Stacey. \u201cCinemas are regulated, they are a safe haven and we as an industry have really played on that.\u201d Top 10 cinema advertisers so far in 2019 (to 28 November) 1. Apple \u2013 \u00a313.5m 2. McDonald\u2019s \u2013 \u00a39.9m 3. Sky \u2013 \u00a36.87m 4. Samsung \u2013 \u00a36m 5. Amazon \u2013 \u00a35.7m 6. BGL Group \u2013 \u00a35.3m 7.
