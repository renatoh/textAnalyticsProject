Three years ago Sunderland's chairman, Niall Quinn, gave up doubling as manager after four games and handed him the reins and no points for starters. It was Keane's first managerial job. He took them to the Premier League as champions. His task at Ipswich, whom he joined for the final two games of last season, looks just as forbidding. He has a two-year contract and demands promotion. One point from two games is nothing in a division in which already only Coventry have not dropped points. But this time he has had three months to prepare. Pre-season included two days of discipline and challenge at Colchester Garrison \u2013 as Keane said, \"to take them out of their comfort zone\". If targets were hit from rifles, in football there is no penetration without precision. \"We were sluggish in the first half,\" said Keane. When they were livelier in the second they still hardly had a shot. Leicester were more co-ordinated if less creatively ambitious. Shocked by spending a first season in the third tier, they have regrouped well under Nigel Pearson. They could have sewn the game up in the second minute, when Wayne Brown culpably headed over. \"It may be apparent later if it's a good point,\" said Pearson. \"At present I'm almost disappointed. There is an air of expectation to achieve the play-offs.\" For Keane it is more urgent, though Ipswich, mindful of reputation, are bent on true foundations after financial turmoil. That reputation was reflected in a 52-page glossy tribute to Sir Bobby Robson, free to fans on Saturday. The club does things properly. Under the chairmanship of Marcus Evans it is not living on rations. Not that Keane has spent lavishly. Crucially he has moved heart and soul, family and dogs, to East Anglia. But the team is less German shepherd than gundog. Clutching at straws, which are plentiful in Suffolk, he said: \"We hung in there when we weren't quite at the races.\" Tomorrow they host Crystal Palace. Richard Wright, back where he began and looking an England goalkeeper, will not be asking for ground shots in practice. Unbeaten Leicester go to unbeaten Sheffield United.
