And so we should. Remember what televised sport was like before Sky, when the evil BBC empire purchased all sporting rights for 10s 6d, and ground its imperious jackboot into the face of sports fans, forcing all sorts of iniquities upon us; like replays from only one angle, single-occupancy commentary boxes, and football highlights played out without a rock music soundtrack? Unthinkable. I have particular reason to be grateful to Murdoch's liberators, without whom this column and its legion of downmarket imitations would have no reason to exist. After all, there are only so many jokes you can make about Mark Lawrenson's moustache, and John Motson's tortuous way with a statistic. Without Sky, I doubt I could have sustained these outpourings for nearly five years. By now, I expect, my meagre stipend would have dried up; or I should have been shuffled sideways into some meaningless position like political editor. So all hail Sky Sports. I gave thanks this Easter by enjoying two of the channel's great glories: Gillette Soccer Saturday and Super League. Super League, especially, is a wonder to those of us who follow rugby league, and remember how the BBC covered the game before Sky came along. For years, Grandstand treated it as a convenient filler between amateur boxing and the 3.15 from Chepstow. They would position a camera or two at bootlace level to ensure top pictures of the mud, never forgetting to interrupt the game if there were some important action going on at a swimming gala somewhere. Thanks to the BBC, rugby league established a reputation it has still not quite shed, as a quaint northern pastime, like clog dancing, underlined by the presence for many years of Eddie Waring, as the \"voice of rugby league\". Waring was, of course, one of television's great \"characters\" for whom we were supposed to be grateful; but I never remember the BBC asking Magnus Pike or the Two Ronnies to front the Five Nations. The beauty of Sky's coverage is that even rugby league fans not tooled up with the requisite technology feel the benefit. The BBC, who now cover just the Challenge Cup - apart from in the North, where an excellent Super League show using Sky's pictures goes out on Sunday mornings - has had to raise its game significantly to compete with Sky. The other week, Steve Rider presented Grandstand live from Wilderspool, the kind of thing that would never have happened pre-Sky. Sky still beats the BBC hollow on rugby league, though; more camera angles, better analysis, better use of replays, and immeasurably better commentary. Eddie Hemmings and Mike \"Stevo\" Stephenson may overdo the hyperbole at times, but they communicate a genuine passion for the sport, and are brand leaders in the never less than entertaining art of talking total bollocks with absolute conviction. When Leeds's Chev Walker fluffed a chance against Warrington, Stevo screamed, \"Oh, the gate was open, I don't know whether it was pearly or not, but ... 'E 'AS BOMBED IT!\" The Wigan-St Helens match on Good Friday could have had commentary by the speaking clock and still have been unmissable. \"Breathtaking,\" Eddie said, and for once he was not overselling it. Wigan were 10 points up with eight minutes to go. \"If Saints score now, that will put the cat amongst the pigeons,\" said Eddie. They duly did. \"Ooooh,\" went Eddie's orgasmic scream, \"Where's that cat? Where are those pigeons?\" That's the stuff, lads. After celebrating Sky's anniversary, some of you may have had a drop or two left to toast Manchester United's premature championship. Gillette Soccer Saturday proved its worth once more to soccer-obsessed sports fans, securing a phone interview with Sir Alex Ferguson, who sounded like he might have been toasting the triumph himself. Lest I be thought of as Sky's unofficial salesman, though, let me just add that you are unlikely to see anything on satellite remotely as good as the two music shows on Channel Four and BBC2 on Saturday night: the Miles Davis Story and Walk On By. What an unalloyed delight: the trumpet of Miles Davis and the voice of Levi Stubbs - the Eddie and Stevo of popular music. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
