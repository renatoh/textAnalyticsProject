The pair were released only after pleas from the union's general secretary, Doug McAvoy. Blunkett's error? He had condemned classroom strikes and promised to fire incompetent teachers. Over the next eight days, thousands of teachers will gather in Liverpool, where the ATL and the NUT are holding their conferences, and in Bournemouth, where the NASUWT is hosting its annual event. The combined membership of the three unions tops 500,000 and represents the vast majority of classroom teachers in the UK. But if the events fall short of the drama of 18 years ago, then this year's conferences are still likely to have some bite. Mary Bousted, general secretary of the ATL, will set the tone in a speech in which she will accuse the education secretary, Michael Gove, of \"shamefully neglecting\" the nation's children and pushing ahead with changes that will damage education. Teachers' morale is at rock-bottom with many choosing to leave the profession because of the changes, which, she says, ignore expert opinion and have no democratic mandate. The ATL and NASUWT extended invitations to Gove, but perhaps unsurprisingly he declined the offers. Charles Clarke, who was education secretary between 2002 and 2004, set a precedent by deciding not to attend the NUT's conference, according to one former government adviser. It was so set in opposition to whatever government was in power, he decided it was not a good way to engage. If a politician does attend, he or she is often subject to jeering followed by regular debates between government press officers and journalists about what exactly constitutes a hecklejeered. Two years ago, even ATL delegates, the more moderate of the three unions, heckled schools minister Nick Gibb because of threats to teachers' pensions and cuts to education funding. Chris Keates, NASUWT's general secretary, said of Gove: \"The reality is he is afraid to face the teaching profession, but he won't be missed.\" The NUT says it doesn't invite ministers. Its general secretary, Christine Blower, said her union decided \"it wasn't the best use of our time\". Good on David Laws then, Gibb's successor, for agreeing to speak at the ATL conference . Top speakers this year mainly come from the trade union movement. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, will be at the NUT and NASUWT conferences, and Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, will also be at the NUT conference. It wouldn't be teaching union conference season unless there was the threat of a strike or two. The word strike appears 36 times in this year's NUT agenda, and nine times in the NASUWT's pamphlet. The two unions have already announced that they intend to stage a series of walkouts in June because of issues with their pay, pensions and workload. Local pay will be high on the agenda. From September, teachers will no longer be able to climb the pay scale according to their length of service. Instead, headteachers will be encouraged to introduce performance-related pay. ATL delegates will propose a no-confidence vote in Gove and Sir Michael Wilshaw, England's chief inspector of schools. Ofsted's \"regime of tyranny\" will be debated again and again with the NUT calling on Wilshaw to resign. The national curriculum changes and what the unions see as schools being forced to become academies will be on the agenda at the NUT, while the NASUWT will dedicate more time to pupil misbehaviour, pay and conditions, and workload. The ATL will debate similar issues to the NUT, but in a less politicised way. It will also discuss family breakup, poverty and the pressure children are under to have a perfect body. But teaching conferences are not all serious. Drinking is a must and stories about what went on at the NUT disco on the Saturday night drift on until the summer term. Neither would conference be conference without endless fliers being handed out from the Socialist Workers party and the Anti Academies Alliance. There are more than a few eccentrics too \u2013 the teachers who stand on the podium and give their speeches in rhyme or insist on audience participation. Conference observers say the teaching unions have had their heyday. How much influence they now have will be tested at a school-by-school level when local pay is introduced. What they decide at conference no longer influences government policy. \"They have the potential to be important, but they need to engage in more solid research and talk to their members in more modern ways, such as through online forums. They have stuck to the traditional sort of conference approach for years,\" said the former government adviser. John Dunford, former general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the unions \"need to think more clearly about how to boost teacher professionalism. There is still too much of the old-fashioned 'working-class' trade union approach, which sometimes damages the profession when it is reprinted in the press.\" Certainly some of the motions seem rather outdated. One of this year's NASUWT motions states: \"Conference deplores the increasing use of electronic means of communication in schools with the expectation that teachers should respond at very short notice \u2026 This is tantamount to bullying and harassment.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
