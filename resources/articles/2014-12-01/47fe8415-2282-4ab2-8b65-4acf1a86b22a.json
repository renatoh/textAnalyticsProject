He is not talking about being caught on the wrong end of an excruciating tackle or recovering from orthopaedic operations necessitated by a habit of exceeding the call of on-pitch duty. Indeed the hurt was not physical. \u201cI played in the 5-1,\u201d Cattermole says, flatly. \u201cIt was a bad performance.\u201d The reference is to October 2010 when, with Shola Ameobi scoring twice and Kevin Nolan three times, Steve Bruce\u2019s then side were thrashed by Chris Hughton\u2019s Newcastle United at St James\u2019 Park. \u201cA lot of our team under-performed,\u201d he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t handle the occasion.\u201d Arguably the best English midfielder not to feature in Roy Hodgson\u2019s current plans, Cattermole has matured as a man and evolved as a footballer in the past four years but the memories of that humiliating day have not been forgotten. \u201cBrucey got us in the next day and said: \u2018Clear the decks, take tomorrow off and do whatever you want as a team, get out and switch off,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe got together, went out, had a chat and a few beers and the next week we got on a good run. The manager handled it well.\u201d On Sunday Sunderland, now in Gus Poyet\u2019s charge, will arrive at St James\u2019 with heads held high as they aim for a fourth straight win against their local rivals. Helping them achieve it would mean a lot to Cattermole, who missed the past two victories on Tyneside through injury and is especially looking forward to a potentially pivotal duel with Moussa Sissoko. \u201cIt\u2019s a special ground for me, I made my debut for Middlesbrough at Newcastle and, barring the 5-1, I\u2019ve got good memories there,\u201d he says. Back in January 2006, he was only 17 when Steve McClaren plunged him in at the deep end before watching the teenager collect a man of the match award following a 2-2 draw. \u201cSteve told me I was starting two hours beforehand, as we were about to leave a hotel on Newcastle quayside,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was brilliant, it was massive. There was a buzz when I saw Alan Shearer coming out of the tunnel. \u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed playing there. As you drive into Newcastle you see the stadium and you get a buzz. It\u2019s a good feeling. There\u2019s a bit of a rough reception from their fans and that\u2019s nice. It\u2019s different. It\u2019s a good atmosphere. The derby\u2019s a big game and you have to embrace it.\u201d Cattermole remains relatively unconcerned by Poyet\u2019s draw specialists having won only two Premier League games this season. \u201cWe feel pretty confident,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in control of most games and I think we know what we\u2019re trying to do. We\u2019ve no real fear of relegation at the minute. I think our performances are better than our league position suggests. I honestly believe we\u2019re not far away from the top 10.\u201d With his traditional black boots, slicked back hair and shirt tucked neatly into shorts pulled high on to the waist, he could easily belong to a different era but, as Sissoko may well discover, Cattermole has blossomed into a very modern midfielder. Far less prone to diving into reckless tackles than in the past and increasingly showing off some superior passing skills, he is, by some distance, Sunderland\u2019s outstanding individual. \u201cIt\u2019s as good as I\u2019ve felt on the pitch,\u201d he acknowledges. \u201cI feel really comfortable but there\u2019s a hell of a lot I want to improve on. I\u2019ve got goals I want to achieve in my career and I\u2019m working towards them every day. A massive plus is that I\u2019ve been injury-free for quite a while now. I\u2019m fit and it\u2019s coming easy to me. \u201cThe manager\u2019s a very good coach and we\u2019ve all improved individually on the back of his work on the training pitch. We\u2019re trying to pass the ball and it makes it easier. We haven\u2019t passed as much under other managers as we have with Gus.\u201d If a 26-year-old capped by England at every junior level is far too grounded to be constantly checking his phone for a call from Hodgson, Cattermole\u2019s ambition should not be underestimated. \u201cEngland\u2019s out of my hands,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m trying to prepare myself in case something does happen. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019d be ready.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
