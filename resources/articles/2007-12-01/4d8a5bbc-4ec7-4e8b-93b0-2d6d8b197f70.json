This means that only those with access to high-quality, English-language lessons in their own country will be eligible to join their spouses in the UK; people who have no access to English classes will be ruled out. These are more likely to be poorer people, people from less developed countries and women, who tend to have fewer educational opportunities than men. The government claims to be serious about cohesion and integration. If so, it should be providing free and accessible classes in English for speakers of other languages for people when they arrive in the UK. Instead, it has cut funding for Esol and has made it difficult for new arrivals and more established residents alike to find an Esol class. Dr James Simpson Research School of Education, University of Leeds Ann Jones says in the Guardian (Translation of council papers 'undermining' English lessons, December 8): \"The funding policy changes introduced in 2007/08 did not reduce Esol budgets, but helped prioritise budgets towards the most disadvantaged groups, those being the unemployed and the low waged.\" In fact, providers of English lessons have had their budget for this cut by 40% - and have at the same time been told to concentrate on learners at higher levels of English language skill. Furthermore, the \"most disadvantaged groups\", and a small funding stream earmarked for unemployed and low-waged Esol learners is derisory when compared to the loss of Learning and Skills Council funding. And for Hazel Blears to try to pass the buck back to councils is only another layer of obfuscation on top of the contradiction at the heart of government policy - which is to talk about the need for people to learn English while reducing the funding to do so very substantially. Dominic Fisher Bristol Councils may spend too much on translation, but the NHS does not. Because family members may be inadequate interpreters and hospital staff who happen to be native speakers of the appropriate language are not authorised translators, the NHS now bans their use as a link to non-English speaking patients. The alternative offered is the \"translation line\", an interpretation service by telephone. Unless a private office can be procured, an interview via the ward telephone is neither personal nor confidential, and information can be missed. The Confidential Inquiry into Maternal and Child Health for 2003-05 cited one mother who died when the extent of her symptoms was misunderstood - her older child was relied on as a translator. Money spent on translating road signs would be better spent on translators for the NHS. Dr John Davies Haverbreaks, Lancaster In the new year the Department of Health and the Home Office will announce whether they will instruct GPs to deny free NHS treatment to failed asylum seekers, undocumented migrant workers and other vulnerable foreign nationals in the UK. While it is right to expect migrants to do their best to comply with immigration control, we reject the premise that the NHS should be turned into a tool of immigration enforcement. We do not see that denying free primary health care would encourage desperate people to return to dangerous and very poor countries. However, it would risk overburdening our A&amp;E departments and promoting discrimination while undermining our ability to control communicable disease.
