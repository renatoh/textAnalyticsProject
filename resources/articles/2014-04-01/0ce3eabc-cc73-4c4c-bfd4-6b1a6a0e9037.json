The program revealed new details about the two nights of disturbances, which led to the death of one asylum seeker, Reza Barati, and serious injuries to dozens of others. Steve Kilburn, a guard who was present during the disturbances and a former Labor MP, also spoke out on the program. The audio recording was said to be from a teleconference between the Immigration Department, G4S, the Salvation Army and International Health and Medical Services the day after Barati\u2019s death. In the recording, an individual identified as a senior G4S officer could be heard saying tensions escalated after stones were thrown by people \u2013 believed to be local Papua New Guineans \u2013 outside the facility. \u201cWhen the compounds started their relatively peaceful protesting there was stone throwing involved outside the compounds into the compounds. That elicited a return response from the transferees,\u201d the officer said. A man said to be a senior officer from the Immigration Department could also be heard saying the immigration minister had \u201cstrong resolve\u201d about offshore processing. But he said the minister believed they needed to make changes at the facility in order for the policy to be sustained. \u201cI think he\u2019s actually more concerned about what are we going to do different,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to change their policy, they\u2019re not going to change their approach. They\u2019ve got very strong resolve. He won\u2019t be able to I think sustain that in the face of no obvious change.\u201d Kilburn said he believed the only outcome of the detention centre was that events would end in serious harm occurring. \"Within a week of arriving on Manus Island I formed the opinion, and I made comments to my wife and people that I know, that there is only one possible outcome here and that is bloodshed,\" he said. The immigration minister, Scott Morrison, also appeared to ease back from an earlier statement he had made about being able to guarantee the safety of asylum seekers at the centre. \"It is absolutely my aspiration, it is my commitment, to ensure that these places are safe, but it is difficult I think to do that in every instance,\" he said. \"These are difficult places to manage, but it is certainly my expectation and it is my instruction to those who run these centres that that's the level of care and support that needs to be provided.\" On Monday Guardian Australia published an interview with Martin Appleby, another G4S whistleblower from the facility. Appleby said Morrison contributed to months of escalating tensions there when he addressed asylum seekers. He also said the PNG incident report teams responsible for responding to crises were given \u201cprobably three days\u201d of training, which he said was not adequate to respond to serious incidents. A spokeswoman for Morrison said there was \u201cno basis in fact\u201d for the allegations that the minister\u2019s trip in September increased tensions at the facility."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
