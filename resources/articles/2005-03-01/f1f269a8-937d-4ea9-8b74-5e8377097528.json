The islands of Svalbard, formerly known as Spitsbergen, comprise a landmass about the size of Scotland, and 60% of the land is permanently covered with ice. It makes for a brilliant, dazzling vista. As the plane descended, colours began to mass on the whiteness, stark against the snowfields. The mountains were richly varied - rusty sandstone, pearly limestone, and the sombre shades of old lava. Some looked like baroque cathedrals, their sides intricately carved. Some were like sphinxes, slumped on to the floors of the valleys. It was only when we were directly above that I could see Longyearbyen, a strip of huts dwarfed by mountains. Svalbard is a few hours flight away from London, yet as the engines of the plane died I felt as if I had flown straight into an icy fantasyland. Until 400 years ago, it was unknown and unseen, part of the blankness of the remote north, the mysterious regions beyond the edges of maps. It was a blankness on to which cartographers and scholars cast fables, crazy imaginings - the ancient Greeks wrote about the Hyperboreans of the north, the unipeds, women with beards; medieval writers tossed in tribes of bright blue people and Arctic ghosts. Svalbard was one of the places called Thule, to geographers of the ancient world the northernmost land. Seen once, and never found again, Thule became an Arctic Atlantis, a shadowy place. Svalbard remained unexplored for longer than either Siberia or Greenland. There were rumours of a Viking arrival sometime in the 12th century, but no one could be certain, and the first undisputed sighting was by the Dutchman Barents in 1596. After this, Svalbard was gradually drawn into the world below - populated by Arctic hunters in search of whales and walruses and furs. With the rush to the North Pole in the 19th century, Svalbard became a last land for explorers heading into the ice. Legions of the intrepid set off from Svalbard: Andr\u00e9 in a hot-air balloon; Amundsen on a successful flight to the Pole. In 1896 the first steamships started bringing tourists from Norway. Svalbard still has the looks of a fantasyland. Yet it also has the infrastructure of a real-life Scandinavian country. Since 1920, it has been a Norwegian territory, and the archipelago is administered with great care. Home to only about 2,000 people, Longyearbyen still has a practical range of shops, restaurants, a supermarket, a post office and a bank, as well as a hospital, a university and a museum. There is a series of log-cabin hotels, one with a stuffed polar bear standing in the doorway, eyeing tourists with a glassy stare. Longyearbyen even has a Radisson hotel, for those who like their wilderness a little luxurious. The Radisson hotel group seems to have picked a good spot. In the last 100 years, Svalbard has become the most-visited Arctic outpost, easier to reach than places at similar latitudes - northern Greenland, Ellesmere Island, Franz Josef Land. Reaching 80 degrees north in these other places involves costly flights, slow-moving boats, or even a spot of dog-sledging. But Longyearbyen can be reached by plane from Oslo in three hours. Once there, prices are cheaper than mainland Norway because the taxes on Svalbard are lower. This alone brings the Norwegians over on beer runs. They are joined on the cold rocks by a diverse array of hikers, wilderness-lovers, scientists, Arctic flora and fauna seekers, skiers, snow-scooter fanatics (in the winter) and even hunters - hunting is strictly controlled on Svalbard, but there are some who still do it. This might make Svalbard sound like an Arctic crossroads, but nothing could be further from the truth. The Norwegians have been scrupulous about regulating this wilderness, trying to keep it pristine. The place is run by a governor - the Sysselmann - a benevolent autocrat appointed by the Norwegian government. The governor's brief is simple: to protect the ancient ice-fields from visitors, and to protect visitors from the ice-fields. These entwined aims have created a network of regulations. Svalbard is divided into distinct areas - those available for tourists, under certain conditions, and those kept as protected nature reserves. Any individual visitor wanting to travel alone into the wilderness has to apply for permission from the governor. They must provide proof they have arranged for search and rescue recovery should they get lost, and that they can fire a gun if they are attacked by a polar bear - there are 3,000 on Svalbard, and they have been known to shamble into camps and attack visitors. As eager as I was to get into the wilderness, I couldn't quite convince the governor of my proficiency with a firearm. Fortunately, there is an excellent range of approved tours on offer. You can even turn up in Longyearbyen and try to persuade a local resident to take you on a hiking trip - the restrictions for locals are less stringent than for visitors. Once you're in the care of a guide or a local, mile upon mile of wilderness opens up. A short boat trip from Longyearbyen and I was sleeping under canvas in vast glacial valleys. The air was thin and clear, and distances were illusory - a mountain it would take three weeks to reach appeared an afternoon's stroll away. By day I went boating along the edges of the fjords, watching bearded seals basking on icebergs, and listening to the low grumbling of the glaciers in the distance. On the tundra plains I saw squat reindeer feeding on moss. We walked for miles across shingle beaches, over mud littered with moraine debris, watching glaucous gulls hover above the waves. At the end of each day we lit a fire and huddled around. Interspersed with the camping and hiking I spent a lot of time in Longyearbyen, mostly enjoying the 24-hour sunlight in the small bars and cafes. They were serving a constant trickle of cognac, useful for taking the edge off the cold. In the small hours, I would wander back to my hotel room - a small, comfortable place with stripped pine walls and pictures of polar explorers everywhere - and draw the curtains on the 3am sunshine. From Longyearbyen I also flew over ice mountains and blue glaciers to Ny-\u00c5lesund - a still smaller settlement that is home to a handful of international scientists and a cluster of coloured huts, arranged around a bust of Amundsen. I stayed in the only hotel, a smart wooden cabin smelling of pine. The other few huts are small centres for research, where scientists assess the movement of currents in the ocean, and the chemical pollutants washing the shores of Svalbard. Ny-\u00c5lesund made me feel a little sorry for the governor - for all his attempts to keep Svalbard pristine, there's nothing he can do about the pollutants arriving from Russian rivers or the airborne pollution from Europe and America. The scientists are concerned about something else, too. Despite the careful balancing of tourism and wilderness, there's an inconsistency on Svalbard, a blind spot in the governor's vision, and these are the remaining mines - one Norwegian, one Russian. The Norwegian mining company is still prospecting. You can visit the Russian mine of Barentsburg on a boat from Longyearbyen - and it is as bleak as you would expect an Arctic mining town to be. When I asked the Ny-\u00c5lesund scientists what they thought of the mines, they were unequivocal. For them, the continued mining of fossil fuels on a wilderness threatened by global warming is a conspicuous paradox. Now the lands of the north are no longer inaccessible dreamlands, our sense of the northern wilderness has changed. Our presence adds new layers of complexity to the absolutes of ice and snow. In Svalbard, the governor tries to combine use of the wilderness with its preservation. The mining seems like pragmatism taken a step too far, but in the case of tourism the governor strikes a fine balance and Svalbard is an excellent example of sustainable tourism. It remains a breathtakingly beautiful place, an astonishing place, with its contrasts of density and lightness, immense burly mountains and soft sifted snow. You step off the plane into the rich silence of the snows. The colours are gaudy in the sunlight - brilliant blue waters, iridescent green moss, white tracts of ice. It is not quite a northern dreamland, but it may be the closest thing we have. \u00b7 You can read Ian McEwan's account of his journey with the Cape Farewell Arctic expedition on our books site section. \u00b7 Click here to see a gallery of the Cape Farewell photos.
