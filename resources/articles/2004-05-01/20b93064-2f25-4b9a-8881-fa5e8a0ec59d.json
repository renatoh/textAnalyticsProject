Instead the man who had fully expected to be confirmed as Leeds United's new manager found himself in the midst of a cruel farce. By last night Blackwell was joined by Leeds fans in being bemused and angry with Alan Smith's controversial move to Manchester United due to go through tomorrow after a \u00a37m fee was agreed yesterday. By mid-morning Blackwell was in limbo after Simon Morris, a Leeds director, unexpectedly vetoed his appointment, temporarily at least, and the club told him he could not expect a final decision until Friday, at the earliest. Interviewed last Wednesday, Blackwell, who spent last season assisting Peter Reid and then Eddie Gray, was quickly informed by the club's board that he had seen off competition from fellow interviewees Ronnie Moore, Rotherham's manager, and Peter Jackson of Huddersfield. Assured the job was his, the popular 45-year-old former Sheffield United coach, took congratulatory calls. And when Peter Lorimer, a Leeds director, called a Monday press conference, it was on the understanding Blackwell would be paraded as the new manager. But yesterday an embarrassed Lorimer told assembled journalists that the coronation had been postponed and it quickly emerged that Blackwell's chat with Morris was the cause. Morris, a young director of self-confidence and strong opinions, was not one of last Wednesday's four-man interview panel and yesterday's meeting with Blackwell had seemingly been arranged as a courtesy measure. Instead, Blackwell later confided to friends that he felt he was under hostile interrogation. Shortly after, other Leeds directors told Blackwell that he would have to wait a little longer but confided the job would probably still be his in the end, with ratification possibly arriving next week. It all begged the question as to whether Morris was acting unilaterally or putting up a smokescreen while the Leeds board continue to negotiate a possible takeover, or even a merger , with the haulier Steve Parkin. It is conceivable Parkin is not entirely enamoured about Blackwell taking charge and would prefer Hull's Peter Taylor, the Hull manager or Crystal Palace's Iain Dowie. Parkin may even hope to lure Gordon Strachan back to Yorkshire. Intriguingly, Morris last night said: \"We are still interviewing; it's in the final stages. We had a long list and now it's a very short list.\" The impression that the directors are talking in riddles was reinforced when Lorimer said: \"We are not ready. We have to look at other options if the one everybody thought it was going to be does not turn out to be the right one.\" Meanwhile, Smith's move, which is expected to see the young full-back Danny Pugh head in the opposite direction, is bound to bring a backlash from Leeds fans angered that the England forward made clear he wanted to go to Old Trafford. Leeds had earlier rejected offers of \u00a33.5m and \u00a35.5m from United. Charlton yesterday made their first signing of the summer by buying Denmark's goalkeeper Stephan Andersen from AB Copenhagen for \u00a3721,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
