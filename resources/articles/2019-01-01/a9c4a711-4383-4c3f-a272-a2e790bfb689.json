The job of excavating two-and-a-half metres of mud from the port is slow and dull. But the UK\u2019s only royal harbour has become the site of fevered debate as it prepares to turn into \u201ca second Dover\u201d in the event of a no-deal Brexit. With only 11 weeks to go and a \u00a313.8m government contract awarded by transport secretary Chris Grayling to Seaborne Freight, a firm with no track record to run Ramsgate\u2019s proposed ferry route to Ostend, the pressure is on. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like that thing [the dredger] is doing very much,\u201d said Margaret Selwood, who was walking her dog along the beach. Selwood, whose late husband \u201cworked in maritime\u201d, was hopeful that a no-deal Brexit could restore Ramsgate to its former glory. \u201cWe were a proud town before they just left all this here to rot and it\u2019s a shame really. I don\u2019t think this lot knows what they\u2019re doing but I think it\u2019s good if it gives us a boost.\u201d Seaborne Freight faced scrutiny and ridicule last week when it was revealed that the firm had no ships, no contracts with Ramsgate or Ostend ports in place, and that the terms and conditions on its website were cut and pasted from a takeaway delivery company. Its CEO, Ben Sharp, was previously managing director of Mercator, a chartering company that collapsed in 2014 with debts of \u00a31.8m. It is understood that Seaborne has hired Dutch company Van Oord to prepare the port to accommodate large cross-Channel ferries. A harbour tradesman, who did not want to be named, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a shambles. Everything is so cloak and dagger and mysterious \u2013 Seaborne have been trying to get hold of this harbour for two or three years now but they have no experience or rep in the industry. It\u2019s not just the dredging \u2013 none of the walkways are safe at the moment, parts of it are condemned. It\u2019s a minimum of 12 weeks\u2019 work. There\u2019s no way it will be up and running in time.\u201d The residents of Ramsgate have been lobbying for the redevelopment of its ailing port for more than 18 months. Run by Thanet District Council and incurring estimated losses of \u00a320m since 2010, Ramsgate harbour has not had a cross-Channel service since 2013. The arrival, then, of Seaborne Freight might have been met with more enthusiasm. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be joking,\u201d laughs John Davis, a campaigner. \u201cIt is a farce. Grayling is pure incompetence.\u201d At lunchtime in the Royal Victoria Pavilion, a grand seaside building converted into Britain\u2019s biggest Wetherspoons, Davis has organised an impromptu meeting of Ramsgate Action Group. \u201cWe\u2019re a bit like a dad\u2019s army,\u201d explained chairman Steve Coombes, who has been railing against Thanet Council and Seaborne Freight for two years. The group is lobbying for Ramsgate\u2019s harbour to be restored into a commercially owned marina village. \u201cWhere was the due diligence with the government handing Seaborne this contract?\u201d asked Coombes. \u201cIt\u2019s all a load of hogwash, they aren\u2019t equipped to deal with a \u00a314m contract. They haven\u2019t got a port to piss in.\u201d A DfT spokesperson said: \u201cBefore any contract was signed, due diligence on Seaborne Freight was carried out both by senior officials at the Department for Transport, and highly reputable independent third-party organisations. \u201cOur contractual arrangements clearly reflect Seaborne Freight\u2019s status as a new ferry operator and as such it is obliged to meet a number of stringent time-staged requirements to demonstrate that it can provide an effective service, with break clauses in the DfT\u2019s favour if it fails to meet them.\u201d \u201cRamsgate is a deprived town and we\u2019re not waiting for the government to inject money here,\u201d said Stephen Byrne, who moved from London. \u201cIt has a wonderful history, Van Gogh lived here, Queen Victoria holidayed here, we\u2019re trying to regenerate the port and harbour as a tourist attraction.\u201d In 2016, the Kent town of about 40,000 people voted overwhelmingly for Brexit with 64% of the Thanet constituency voting Leave, based on a 73% turnout \u2013 one of the highest in the UK. According to Davis, very few locals will have changed their mind: \u201cIt was never about too much immigration really,\u201d he nodded awkwardly. \u201cIt\u2019s about jobs, housing and paying all that money to the EU.\u201d Irene, who works in a cafe by the train station, agreed. \u201cWe just want it over with now, it\u2019s a joke. I\u2019ll be honest, Brexit comes on the news and I turn it over, it\u2019s bad isn\u2019t it? But we need to get out and just get on with it. The majority of us voted for it and it\u2019s only right.\u201d Irene would not be pressed on whether she would prefer Britain crashing out with no deal. \u201cTheresa May is trying but she\u2019s doing a bad job, a terrible job.\u201d What did she make of the revival of Ramsgate\u2019s port? \u201cI think them doing what they\u2019re doing can only be a good thing, because it will be better for businesses here.\u201d Ramsgate has been hit hard by a decade of austerity, unemployment is higher than the average for both Kent and the country as a whole. Where neighbouring Margate has enjoyed a resurgence by attracting an artistic community priced out of London, this district of Thanet once had the UK\u2019s only Ukip-led council. \u201cWe voted a Ukip council but not because we\u2019re \u2026 Ukip-y,\u201d explained Davis. \u201cWe were fed up \u2013 but it\u2019s gotten worse. We\u2019re being left behind.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
