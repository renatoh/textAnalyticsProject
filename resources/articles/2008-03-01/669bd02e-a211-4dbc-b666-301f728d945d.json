Should he hit families and businesses with yet more tax rises, or should he set out a long-term plan to stimulate economic growth and reduce taxes over the years ahead? As you've no doubt seen from the coverage, the chancellor didn't opt for the long-term plan. Instead, he went and announced more stealth taxes that will make people in London and across Britain worse off. It's clear why Alistair Darling was left with such a stark choice to make. It's because his predecessor at the Treasury, Gordon Brown, spent too much and borrowed too much while the economy was strong. As a result, the government has run out of money just as Britain is heading into an economic slowdown. To put it another way, Labour haven't prepared the economy for the rainy days ahead. We're all going to be paying the price for this economic incompetence. The dire public finances have prompted the chancellor to put up income tax on anyone earning less than \u00a318,000 a year. Five million people in Britain will end up worse off as a result of this income tax rise. Who would have thought a Labour government would be trying to fix its economic problems on the back of the low paid? What's more, the state of the public finances meant that Darling increased taxes on 43 million drinkers and seven in ten motorists. The Conservative party believes in higher green taxes. But the only way to win the argument for green taxes is to make absolutely clear that they are designed to change behaviour, not raise extra revenue. There is nothing more damaging to the case for action on climate change than the cynical use of green taxes as stealth taxes, which gives green taxes a bad name. So we will use every extra penny raised in green taxes to reduce taxes elsewhere. Similarly, we have set out plans for significant tax rises on problem drinks such as alcopops and super-strength beers and ciders. But unlike the government, we will use the additional revenues to cut taxes on low strength beers and ciders. We have set out a different approach. We've got a long term plan to restore stability and protect mortgages and jobs. We will only use green taxes to cut taxes elsewhere, instead of using them as an excuse for more stealth taxes. And we will abolish stamp duty for nine out of ten first-time buyers, helping more young people buy their first home. That's the right approach for people across Britain.
