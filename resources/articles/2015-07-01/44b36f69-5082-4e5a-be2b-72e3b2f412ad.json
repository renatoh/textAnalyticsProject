Leaving behind the darker, sparse elements of 2010\u2019s LP4, the noodly guitar and synthesiser duo crank up the noise and amplify their skittering energy on this fifth studio album. This news ought to please fans who have spent the past five years waiting for the return of vintage Ratatat, who first appeared in 2004 with an entirely unholy and exciting mishmash of hip-hop production, a squealing guitar and blooping synths. They still sound like a Jimmy Page or Brian May solo let loose over a Nintendo game interlude: playful, and wilfully ignoring 2015\u2019s major pop and electronic music trends. Single Cream on Chrome floats into an effervescent groove, while Nightclub Amnesia starts off knee-deep in crunching guitars before recalling Justice circa 2007. Magnifique drags a bit, as can often be the case with instrumental tracks centred on repetitive patterns, but it demonstrates the band\u2019s commitment to their oddball signature style."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
