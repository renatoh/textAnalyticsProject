But off screen, the cast of the television soap Neighbours are engaged in bitter spats, drug addictions and personal dramas, a court has heard. The warts-and-all insight into Australia's longest-running soap comes during an unfair dismissal claim brought by a former star, Shane Connor. Mr Connor played the family man Joe Scully for four years and is suing the show's producer, Grundy Television, for wrongful termination of his contract in September 2003. He is seeking A$200,000 (\u00a385,000) for nine months of lost earnings. The court in Victoria heard yesterday that Mr Connor developed an amphetamine problem while employed on the show, clashed with cast members and crew and disrupted the filming schedule because he was late. The actor admitted suffering from \"amphetamine hangovers\" on the set in April 2003 that affected his performances, but denied being aggressive or unprofessional. \"I was at the time dealing with an amphetamine problem,\" Mr Connor told the court. \"I believe that I was not [acting] as good as I could have been.\" On Friday the court was shown a tape with scenes featuring Mr Connor, as Scully, struggling with the delivery of lines and becoming frustrated. During one outtake, the actor let out a roar of frustration after stumbling over his words. But he claimed that Janet Andrewartha, who played his on-screen wife Lyn Scully, did not like him and was behind most of the \"nitpicking\" complaints to producers behind his back. The hearing continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
