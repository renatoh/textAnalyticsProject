I'm good Small Talk, how are you? Not bad at all, thanks for asking. Say, it's been a great 12 months or so for you, hats off ... Yes it has, it's been amazing. I've broken a couple of records and obviously this season just seems to be getting better and better. But yeah, the year's just been incredible. It seems crazy to think you almost retired a couple of years ago. Does that make your success all the more satisfying? Of course it does. I was practically a week away from retiring. If someone had said to me then, \"In about two years' time, you're going to be flying and on the verge of getting into the top 50,\" there's no way I would have believed that. Of course it just makes it so much more special. What's been the highlight? Breaking into the top 100 after nine years? Beating your first top-10 player? Obviously the first big one was the end of last year, making the top 100, that was a really big thing. Then the win against Li Na [at Indian Wells], my first top-10 win, it was just incredible. Winning the $100,000 in Michigan was fantastic as well, that's the first time I've ever done that. Oh, and making the third round at the Australian Open. So yeah, there are quite a few things that I've achieved already this year. Talking about the top-10 win, Small Talk remembers a few years ago at Wimbledon Sarah Borwell was playing Ana Ivanovic and she said within a few shots of the warm-up she knew she was screwed. Have you ever had an experience like that before? [Laughs] To be honest I think I know what she means, because when you're playing the top players and you're warming up, you're thinking 'Oh my gosh, they are actually very good'. But I can't say I've actually gone into a match and thought I've got no chance. Because if you're going to think that, you know that your chances are very slim, so I've always tried not to think about that. Hmm, that's probably why your highest ranking is 52 and hers is 199. Now, which of the top players who you haven't played would you most like to? [Sounds excited] Do you know what, there are two players who I'd really like to play, Elena Dementieva and Serena Williams. Can you look beyond Serena for the Wimbledon title? If Small Talk fancied having a bit of a flutter would she be your tip? It'll be very, very difficult to beat Serena. Blimey, I mean, Serena's going to be the favourite to take the title again. But the one person who could potentially trouble her is Justine Henin, but I think that's the only person really. Your coach, Nino, has played a big part in your recent success. He's also your ex-boyfriend. That sounds complicated \u2026 We still have a great relationship. That was one of the things, I didn't want to lose Nino even after we split up, I didn't want to lose him as a coach. He's helped me so much and everything's fantastic now, we have a great relationship and it really does work. So you haven't forced him to take a pay cut or anything since you split up? No, definitely not. No! When you were together, did you have a problem with him telling you what to do? Small Talk can't even get in a car with Mr Small Talk without having a row \u2026 Do you know what, what I loved about it, was that obviously in our free time we were dating. But when it was business and us on court, it was strictly professional. I think that's why now, even though we're no longer together, it still works, we just get straight into the professional side. That's why we're a really good team. Speaking of good teams, the Baltacha family is something of a sporting dynasty. Your dad played football for the Soviet Union, your brother was also a footballer and your mum was a pentathlete. When you were growing up, the party games at Christmas must have got rather competitive. Oh yeah, yeah. I remember the whole family would argue when we were playing cards. It was unbelievable, we're all so competitive and we'd end up calling each other cheats. I even remember playing football together and that would usually break out into an argument, because no one wanted to lose. It's quite funny when I look back. Who used to win? It would depend on what we were playing. If we were playing tennis, usually me and my brother would beat my mum and dad. If it was football, my brother and my dad, obviously, because they were professionals. And cards, me and my mum, I must admit we used to cheat as a pair to gang up on the boys. That's the spirit. You first moved to Britain when your dad signed for Ipswich, before he went on to join St Johnstone. Was it a culture shock coming over from Kiev, or were you too young to remember? Yeah to be honest I was six, so I don't really remember that much. But I do remember we got here and I just couldn't understand what anyone was saying. It was quite interesting the first few months, trying to learn a new language, but I loved it. Considering your ties with Ukraine, Scotland and England, you must be relieved only England made it to the World Cup \u2026 Yeah I am such a mix. Having been born in Kiev and obviously lived in Scotland and England, I am such a mix. But if there are any sporting events that are on, I'll support any of them. Very diplomatic. Have you had a chance to watch much of the World Cup so far? I haven't really. I watched the last England game, but it's been difficult because of all my practice and matches. But I think when England next play I will watch. Small Talk would advise against that. When you do get any time off, what are your hobbies? Apparently you're a bit of a whizz in the kitchen? Yeah I'm really into cooking, I absolutely love cooking anything and everything. I really enjoy baking as well. My favourite thing to make is a victoria sponge cake. It is actually outrageous. I'm not bigging myself up here, but I can do an unbelievable dessert. I know that sounds really arrogant, but that is probably my best dish. If you could invite three people round to sample your victoria sponge, who would you choose? I can only invite three? That's tough [pause]. Right, I think the first one I'd invite would be Lady Gaga. The second one [longer pause] \u2026 I'd invite Billy Connolly. And probably the third one I'd invite [even longer pause] \u2026 oh probably Johnny Depp. I think that would be good fun. We'd love to be a fly on the wall at that soiree. What would you be listening to, what's the last piece of music you bought? The last CD I bought was actually one of those Now complications. I can't remember what number it was, maybe 72. And what's the most extravagant thing you've ever bought yourself, didn't you get a new car recently? Yeah I bought a car, but it wasn't brand new or anything flash. The thing is, I'm never at home, so there just wasn't any point. And then it would probably get battered by someone. But that's probably the most expensive thing I've bought. So you didn't follow Andy Murray's lead and get yourself a Ferrari? No no, it's a [Peugeot] 206. Good to hear you're staying grounded. Now, what would you stick in Room 101? That's really funny, I was chatting about this the other day. I'd probably put buses in there, to be honest. Buses? Yeah because they cause so much trouble really and I think there's enough public transport. If you could have a superpower for the day, what would it be? [Sounds very excited] Ooh I wish I could fly. I'd love that, that would be amazing. And just one more for you before you go \u2026 who would win a fight between a lion and a tiger? I'd probably say a lion. Yeah I'll go for a lion. Why so? Just random. [Wavers slightly] Why, does anyone say a tiger? It happens every now and then. Oh okay \u2026 I think I'll stick with the lion though. That's fine Elena, anything goes here. Thanks for your time and best of luck at Wimbledon. Thanks Small Talk. Bye!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
