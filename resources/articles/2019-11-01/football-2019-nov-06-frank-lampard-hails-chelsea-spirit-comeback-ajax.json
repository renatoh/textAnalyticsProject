Chelsea were outplayed for long spells by the Dutch champions and were on their way to an embarrassing home defeat midway through the second half. Ajax had taken a commanding lead thanks to strikes from Hakim Ziyech and Donny van de Beek and own-goals from Kepa Arrizabalaga and Tammy Abraham. Yet C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta reduced the deficit and Ajax unravelled, losing both of their centre-backs, Daley Blind and Jo\u00ebl Veltman, to red cards in the move that allowed Jorginho to score his second penalty of the night. Down to nine men, Erik ten Hag\u2019s side cracked when Reece James, Chelsea\u2019s 19-year-old right-back, equalised and they were relieved when Azpilicueta had a potential winner ruled out after VAR spotted a handball by Tammy Abraham. \u201cFor a performance like today you need characters and personalities,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cAt 3-1 down at half-time, it\u2019s easy to turn it in. Even easier at 4-1. But we never did. I keep saying it about the experienced players. Those players really pushed tonight and I loved it.\u201d There was a mixture of relief and deflation for Lampard at the end. The draw keeps Chelsea level on points with Ajax and Valencia with two games left. Valencia, who thrashed Lille 4-1 in the group\u2019s other game, host Lampard\u2019s side later this month. \u201cI always felt this group was going to be tight,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager said. \u201cI felt teams could take points off each other. We\u2019re in it but we certainly have work to do. We need to go to Valencia and Lille come here. Both of those are very tough matches. I felt today we could have won the game and that\u2019s with respect to Ajax because they are a top team. The performances in Lille and at Ajax should give us confidence. Valencia have had a great result tonight and that will give them confidence that they can go through.\u201d Lampard, who lost Mason Mount to an ankle injury during the second half, was impressed with James after he brought the youngster on at half-time. \u201cReece is a fantastic young player and he gives what you saw,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is going to be a great player for this club.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
