Having disposed of Liverpool in the previous round, Barnsley only went and did it again by knocking Chelsea out of the FA Cup on a memorable night in South Yorkshire. Dickie Bird, Darren Gough, Arthur Scargill, Michael Parkinson - your boys dished out one hell of a beating. In a year of surprises in the old competition, this in many ways was perhaps the biggest. Only one division separates the Londoners from the Tykes, yet in terms of playing power and overall resources the two are light years apart. This had been billed by many as Barnsley's cup final, the expectation being that their dramatic run would be brought to an honourable end. Instead, they are Wembley-bound for the semi-finals. The way this year's competition is panning out, you would not bet against them winning it. The only goal of the game was scored by a Nigerian forward with just one strike to his name so far this season. Step forward 26-year-old journeyman Kayode Odejayi, bought for the relatively large sum of \u00a3200,000 from Cheltenham last May. The man menaced Chelsea's back line all evening and left the field to a standing ovation with nine minutes of normal time remaining. No matter what he goes on to achieve in his career, he will always be remembered in this corner of Yorkshire as the hero who put Barnsley into the semi-finals of the FA Cup for the first time since 1912. And to think he was playing only because team-mate Jon Macken was cup-tied. 'I didn't think that the Anfield win could be eclipsed, but it has been,' said manager Simon Davey, who admitted his own career as a lower-division midfielder has been 'blown away' by recent events at Oakwell. 'I can't believe it. I just hope I don't wake up tomorrow and find it's all been a dream. I think the players went out and enjoyed the game. Nobody was found wanting. Everybody put a shift in and they've come up trumps again. To go to Anfield and win and then to beat Chelsea in the same season is a fantastic achievement and the players deserve a lot of credit.' So can Barnsley, crazy as it sounds, win the FA Cup? 'I really don't know what to believe any more,' Davey added. 'But when you've beaten Liverpool and Chelsea, there's no one to fear.' All the pre-match indications were that the Tykes were going to struggle. OK, so the Yorkshiremen had won at Liverpool and, in the only previous FA Cup meeting between the sides, thumped Chelsea 4-0 at Oakwell in 1989, when both outfits were in the old Second Division. However, their record since scaling the heights at Anfield three weeks ago has been pretty poor, with just three Championship points collected from a possible 12. There was also the spectre of Chelsea's last visit here hanging over proceedings, a 6-0 win for the Londoners in 1997 during Barnsley's memorable yet ultimately ill-fated year-long sojourn in the top flight. On that occasion Gianluca Vialli bagged four goals. Yesterday you could have got relatively low odds of 45-1 on Nicolas Anelka repeating that feat. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, Barnsley's supporters still packed Oakwell in hope, inspired by Chelsea manager Avram Grant's decision to rest Frank Lampard and Davey's battle cry that 'anything is possible'. Throughout the first half it looked as though that was just the case - and then some. By the time referee Steve Bennett blew for the break, Barnsley should have been one goal up, maybe two. Their first decent opportunity arrived in the 22nd minute when Carlo Cudicini, unsure whether a ball from John Terry constituted a back-pass or not, struck his clearance into the advancing Odejayi, only to see it rebound narrowly past his right post to safety. Had Istvan Ferenczi kept his head instead of volleying wide from 10 yards out, Barnsley would have had the lead their endeavour and no little skill deserved. Within a minute, Cudicini had redeemed himself with a good block from Odejayi at the expense of a corner. It was backs-to-the-wall stuff from Chelsea, who failed to test Luke Steele, hero of Barnsley's fifth-round win at Liverpool, seriously throughout the entire half. It looked as though the Yorkshiremen would pay for their failure in front of goal as Grant's side came out firing in the second period. Shaun Wright-Phillips fed Anelka on the right and he in turn found Joe Cole, only for a bobble to distract the England man, who shot well wide. Anelka cut inside only to hit a weak daisy-cutter straight at Steele. Another Anelka effort was blocked. The tide appeared to have turned. And then up stepped Odejayi. When Martin Devaney hoisted a high ball in from the right in the 66th minute, the forward - later to have his shirt signed in a magnanimous gesture by Terry - rose high above Cudicini to head down and into Chelsea's net, sending three sides of Oakwell into delirium. The bulk of the remaining 24 minutes plus stoppage time was, hardly surprisingly, played in Barnsley's half of the field. Yet Davey's side managed to hold out, surviving one or two scares and a premature pitch invasion staged by home supporters. It was not quite like watching Brazil, as the old Barnsley saying goes, but it was a dammed sight more dramatic. 'I need to congratulate Barnsley. They played well and showed good spirit today,' said Grant, who nevertheless had a slight pop at the state of the Oakwell pitch, criticism rejected by Davey, who responded by calling it a 'good passing surface'. As for questions regarding whether Chelsea had underestimated Barnsley, Grant said: 'We knew this team beat Liverpool away, so I don't think it's a case of taking them lightly. Maybe this year is the [FA] Cup not for the big teams. This was a game we needed to win and we didn't win. We lost the game today. We are not happy about it, but it's happened.' THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT Paul Gallagher, BarnsleyFC.org.uk What a day! I'm still shaking. I hope the FA go easy on our pitch invasion, it was understandable. We really deserved this - we had the best chances and defended brilliantly when we had to. It was great Odejayi scored - he's come in for a bit of stick recently. But it's unfair to single anyone out - they all worked their socks off. You never know, after knocking out Liverpool and Chelsea we really could get to the final. It would be good to get the least fancied team next, but we've proved we can take anyone on. Chelsea weren't that bad, though I didn't like to see Joe Cole diving around. We sang 'Premiership, you've having a laugh' and then our old favourite: 'It's just like watching Brazil.'

Grant has changed a team of winners into 11 strangers. It shows our desperation that when we needed a goal we had to bring on Pizarro. Did their keeper have a save to make? We desperately missed Lampard and Drogba, but against Barnsley we should be able to cope. Essien and Wright-Phillips were particularly poor. You have to be worried now - the players have a huge lack of confidence. The West Ham result was papering over the cracks - they were woeful, whereas Barnsley, like Spurs, were up for it and beat us. Abramovich is going to have to face up to the fact that he has made a big mistake with Grant and get in someone new to salvage our season.
