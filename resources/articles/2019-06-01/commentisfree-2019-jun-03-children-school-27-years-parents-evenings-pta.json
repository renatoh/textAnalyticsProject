At last I can stop pretending to like it", "bodyText": "School\u2019s out for ever. Just one more week and I will be free. FREE! I cannot tell you how I long for the end of school. You see, in the bizarre sociological experiment that is my life, I have had one child or another in school for about 27 years, and my youngest finishes next week. I have done my time. Obviously I sacrificed my offspring for the sake of my political principles, so these were state schools, of course. I never, ever want to hear another person saying they believe in state education \u2013 but just not for their very special child. Pray that I never need to inhale the stench of that angsty hypocrisy again while some dolt explains it is only \u201cnatural\u201d to want the best for one\u2019s children \u2013 as though I want the worst for mine. Not only do I not understand segregating one\u2019s child in a reinforced bubble; I don\u2019t even like school. It wasn\u2019t my thing as a child. Why would it be as a parent? Why do I have to pretend? If you don\u2019t like school, then these really are not the best days of your life. It all feels like a constant interruption of who you are, and no amount of motivational talks on \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d changes that. As a parent I have watched the evolution of a particular kind of misery that we now impose in the name of \u201cstandards\u201d, under both Labour and Tory governments: the slow squeezing of joy from the curriculum, the reduction of art and music, the decimation of languages, the erasing of creativity in the humanities. I have heard of teachers burning out or going under. The one who used to make each kid stand outside for five minutes, because she would not teach a class with more than 30 pupils. The one who used to sob his way through history. The one who gave them all vodka. All of them gone, replaced by \u201creply teachers\u201d as my children called them. Sad, yes, but I am not sad that I will never have to go to another parents\u2019 evening complete with a list of instructions: \u201cDon\u2019t say anything, don\u2019t make faces, don\u2019t be embarrassing.\u201d No more school quizzes or PTA meetings \u2013 or Tinder for people who can\u2019t be bothered, as I call them. Never again will I receive a text about the wrong trainers, an illegal \u201cbelly top\u201d or an undone top button. As all schools have suffered this awful academisation, the enforcing of petty rules often seems to be the raison d\u2019etre of education. Never again will I share a cab with an MP who explains how to get my kids into the right school, even though though I don\u2019t live in the catchment area (reader, I did not follow their advice). No more chats with anxious parents who do their kids\u2019 homework but have not got the highest mark. No more French exchanges: \u201cMum, you have to do a buffet breakfast every morning because that\u2019s what French people eat.\u201d Never again will I offer to take a Parisian teenager anywhere she would like to go, to be met with the answer: \u201cLe Primark.\u201d The gentrification of my part of London is there in the class pictures. Those of my eldest are racially mixed and those of my youngest are not. I see ethnic and social cleansing by property price, and no amount of international evenings at school makes up for that. Sure, I am grateful for the good teachers who have guided us through. I have managed without ever really knowing what a key stage is. I just wanted my kids to be able to read. Most of school is crowd control. Ease with other people, curiosity and the ability to daydream cannot be measured. A* grades tell you what, exactly? What is a good education? One that makes you feel able to go on learning for the rest of your life, not one that sucks the life out of you by cramming and testing. So I am done. School\u2019s out completely, for ever."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
