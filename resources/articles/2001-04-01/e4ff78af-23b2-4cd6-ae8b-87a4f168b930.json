The central defender failed a post-match drug test after the Rome club's 4-1 win at Fiorentina on January 28. A corroborative second sample is being tested and the results will be announced later this month. The nature of the banned substance has not been revealed but the Italian and Portuguese media have widely reported it as the anabolic steroid nandrolone. \"I'm confident that I'll be cleared,\" Couto said yesterday. \"If I'm picked to play on Satur day I'll do so and I'll give 100%.\" If the second test confirms the first, Couto faces a ban of at least a year. Two players from the Serie A side Perugia and one from second division Pescara were handed 16-month suspensions for similar offences earlier this season. Lazio have issued a statement in which they denied club staff had administered any banned substances and said that the club insisted on regular dope and haemocrit-level tests for players. The latter indicate the presence of stamina-boosting drugs such as erythropoietin. Couto has been capped 75 times for his country, a national record he shares with the goalkeeper Vitor Baia. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
