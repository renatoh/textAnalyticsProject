But the country's wine industry is in crisis nevertheless, wrote Georges Dupuy in L'Express. French wine exports have fallen for the sixth year in a row and domestic wine sales are also decreasing. More than half the population say they are not interested in wine. And of those who do buy wine, 80% admit they don't really know anything about it. French wine makers recognise the need to boost sales, through advertising and marketing. Many of them, though, can't abide the idea that wine should be treated and sold like any other lowly product, as if wine were no more important than \"vanilla yoghurt\" or something \"you get from a vending machine\", Dupuy wrote. The wine industry is especially suspicious of marketing men, one wine writer told him, and views them as \"part of the axis of evil\". But, warned Dupuy, these concerns with protecting the \"cultural heritage\" of French wine risk will only serve to worsen the crisis. Action, it seems, is needed. A Carpenter's work continues It might be more than 30 years since Yesterday Once More by the Carpenters was a hit in Britain, but Justin Michell felt it was stalking him in China. \"In a single day, I heard it three times - the original version in a taxi and a restaurant, and again as a clarinet instrumental in a piano bar,\" he wrote in the Hong Kong Weekend Standard (November 6-7). To discover why the song was seemingly omnipresent in China, he sought enlightenment from Kaiser Kuo, who founded one of China's first heavy metal bands, Tang Dynasty, in 1988. The Carpenters dwarf the Beatles in popularity because their music was the first from a western act to be made legally available in China, explained Kuo. Before music piracy took off in the mid-90s, the Carpenters' Greatest Hits was the most widely available album in the country. \"The major Chinese music distributors really only had that ... and some old John Denver.\" But why does China not love other Carpenters' hits as much? The reason was simple: Yesterday Once More was the first track on the greatest hits compilation. \"That aside,\" said Kuo, \"people in China uniformly love Karen's deep, sultry voice. It stood out then and stands out now as something totally unlike the vocal stylings of any Chinese singer ... My very cool, very hip friends ... still profess a love for the Carpenters and can't imagine that they're a sort of a joke to most young westerners.\" Welcome to Sicily-on-Clyde Mariangela Gambrone is among 10 young croupiers from Palermo who have been working in one of Glasgow's casinos since September, reported Corriere della Sera (November 10). The 20-year-old and her fellow Sicilian deck dealers and roulette wheel spinners were trained by Christine Chilton, \"an elegant, determined Brit who managed casinos all over the world before deciding to teach others the trade\". Chilton's croupier school is based in Sarzana, 50 miles south of Genoa, but there is also a branch in Palermo. During a two-month course, which costs \u20ac1,500 (\u00a31,000), students learn \"the secrets of the green table\" as well as basic English - \"then its off to Britain with a British gaming licence, a contract and adventure\". Since Chilton works for four British casino chains, she can guarantee graduates a job. She admitted, however, that persuading young Sicilians it is not a scam is difficult, and many do not seem to want to leave home or learn another language,despite the high unemployment levels in Sicily. But Gambrone was glad she took the course and left the \"Mediterranean warmth\" of Sicily for the leaden skies of Glasgow. \"I'm never going to leave,\" she said. First, Glasgow was not as costly as she had expected. More importantly, \"They treat me like a queen. They'd never do that in Palermo.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
