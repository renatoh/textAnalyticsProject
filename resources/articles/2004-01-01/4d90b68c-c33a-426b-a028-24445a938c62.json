We should have made it clear that the Ministry of Defence had said that there was no evidence that drink had in any way been involved. It is the most heavily fortified area of Baghdad: a vast compound of palaces and palm trees, protected by an enormous concrete wall. The Green Zone, as it is known, was once Saddam Hussein's secretive presidential palace. It now serves as the equally off-limits HQ for British and American officials in Iraq - and, it appears, for the special forces units that have been involved in the hunt for Saddam and his regime. In the early hours of New Year's Day, two experienced SAS soldiers, Major James Stenner and Sergeant Norman Patterson, were returning to barracks. They never made it. As they approached the entrance, they lost control of their unmarked 4x4 vehicle and smashed into a line of concrete bollards. There were, it seems, few witnesses. \"It happened between 2.30am and 3am. The streets were empty. There was nobody around,\" shopkeeper Haitham Muhammad, who claims to have seen the crash, said. The Iraqi police officers just round the corner knew nothing of the mysterious accident, in which both soldiers died. It was only five days later that the Ministry of Defence named the men. In the ministry's laconic three-line press release announcing their death was a clue to their status as special forces troops - the names of their parent regiments, respectively the Welsh Guards and the Cheshire Regiment. Neither regiment is deployed in Iraq. MoD officials also revealed one other tantalising detail - that Major Stenner had been awarded the Military Cross during last year's war in Iraq. He had, it appeared, played a leading role in the covert military campaign to topple Saddam. His father, Alan, was also an SAS officer. Inevitably, the fatal crash, coming only hours after a suicide car bomber blew up a popular Baghdad restaurant, killing eight people, raised more questions than answers. What were the two SAS officers doing in Iraq, and why did they lose control of their vehicle while driving on an empty road in the early hours of the morning? Could they have been drunk? The vast majority of British troops in Iraq are stationed not in Baghdad but in the dusty south of the country, around the city of Basra. But it has long been an open secret that the SAS - and its marine equivalent, the SBS - have been actively involved in other parts of Iraq in the hunt for Saddam and fugitive members of his regime. (Three SAS soldiers were recently spotted buying a fridge in central Baghdad. Asked whether they would pose for a photograph, the men replied in the negative. \"You know why not,\" one said.) Even before last year's war, SAS and SBS troops were operating deep inside Iraq in small patrols, sometimes with American special forces. During the conflict they were dropped off in Iraq's western desert. There, they secured several airfields and also disabled at least two Scud missile launchers. They also captured oilfields in the south and helped block Iraqi supply lines across the Iraq-Syria border. At least one operation appears to have gone disastrously wrong: Iraqi tribesmen attacked 10 special forces soldiers dropped by helicopter in the northern city of Mosul. The Iraqis captured their Land Rover and heavy weapons; the pictures of the British vehicle shown on al-Jazeera were an undoubted propaganda coup for Saddam. A Chinook helicopter eventually rescued eight of the team after they made off on foot for nearby hills. The other two escaped across the border into Syria, and were only released after the embarrassing intervention of the Foreign Office minister, Mike O'Brien, who raised their case with Syria's pro-Saddam government. According to senior US military officials, the SAS played no role in last month's capture of Saddam, who was discovered after a tip-off in a small hole near Tikrit. But the SAS did locate and arrest Saddam's half-brother Watban al-Tikriti, the former interior minister and number 37 on the US's list of 55 most wanted Iraqis, in northern Iraq. In November an SBS marine, Corporal Ian Plank, was killed in what, according to defence sources, was a \"big battle\" in the same area between Saddam loyalists and British special forces. The battle took place near Mosul in what military sources said yesterday was a \"well-known stronghold of Saddam supporters\". Operating with US special forces, the SAS and SBS stormed a heavily protected compound, and are believed to have killed up to 10 Iraqis and captured a number of foreign fighters, including Saudis. There seems little doubt, then, that Stenner and Patterson would have been involved in several top-secret missions in Iraq, killing when the job required it. Stenner, who came from Monmouthshire, was the commander of one of two SAS \"sabre\" squadrons deployed in Iraq. Defence sources say around 100 SAS and up to 50 SBS soldiers have served in Iraq - a tiny proportion of Britain's overall commitment of 10,000 troops. But why did two highly professional officers crash their vehicle? The families of Patterson (from Staffordshire) and Stenner have declined to speak. British officials based at the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), hidden inside the Green Zone, yesterday refused to elaborate, citing the MoD's rule of secrecy over the activities of special forces. \"We have held extensive discussions about the accident but there is nothing more I can tell you,\" one said. Iraqi officials, on the other hand, have been more forthcoming. \"If they were not drunk, it's a complete mystery,\" Lt Maj Ahmed A'Bais al-Shummarey, the director of police for the Green Zone, said yesterday. \"There might have been a technical problem suddenly, or perhaps they didn't know the way the street curves. But at that time of night the only vehicles out on the roads are military or Iraqi police patrols.\" He added: \"There is no curfew in Baghdad. But people don't drive after 10.30pm. The cars we stop after that are emergency medical cases.\" On New Year's Eve, in the hours before the crash, the Iraqi capital was in a state of high alert. At 9.20pm a suicide car bomber had driven his white Corolla into the side of Nabil's - a popular restaurant that serves whisky and had advertised a New Year's Eve party, complete with belly dancing. The explosion brought down the restaurant's roof, killing eight people inside and injuring 30, including three journalists from the Los Angeles Times. It was a big blast. The smoke would have been visible from the Green Zone, a short distance away across the Tigris river, and - presumably - from the SAS's HQ. Afterwards, most Baghdadis abandoned plans for celebration and went home. The mysterious crash a few hours later was a reminder that even SAS soldiers are human. Officially, of course, the activities of British special forces are secret. It is a policy that encourages myths and mystery. But the official policy is deeply hypocritical. Privately, special forces take great delight in leaked - and often embroidered - stories of narrow escapes, firefights and derring-do. The few reliable scraps of information that do emerge merely appear to confirm the myth. Last year, military honours were given to 11 unidentified members of the special forces. They included six Military Crosses and three awards to Chinook helicopter pilots. Many of the SAS soldiers currently in Iraq also took part in the Bush administration's last war in Afghanistan. In November 2001, a small group of SAS soldiers operating in the north of the country participated in the battle against Taliban prisoners in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif. The prisoners had broken out of the compound where they were being held, and had killed a CIA officer, Mike Spann. The SAS soldiers - casually dressed in jeans and jumpers - immediately began eliminating Taliban fighters who had survived repeated attacks by American fighter aircraft. It was a ruthless business. The SAS, hiding on the parapets above, opened fire on the Taliban sheltering among the trees with a heavy machine gun. An Afghan cameraman captured the drama. After an American bomb hit a stable block, sending up a cloud of dust, three SAS soldiers drilled fire at survivors who might be crawling from the wreckage. As dusk fell, the SAS men casually wandered off. \"That's it, mate,\" one of them told the Americans. Yesterday, meanwhile, there was no trace of the crash outside the Green Zone. Outside the razor wire is the real Baghdad - a place of traffic jams, of endless queues for petrol, and of growing frustration at the US occupation. To walk inside the Green Zone is to enter a surreal other planet - a place where Republican party supporters sit in a vast, lavishly equipped press office, and the televisions are permanently tuned to Fox TV. Most coalition officials in Iraq never leave the compound. The irony is that, as experienced SAS men, Major Stenner and Sgt Patterson had the liberty to do exactly what they wanted; a freedom that in the end cost them their lives."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
