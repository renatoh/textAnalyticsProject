We were going to be funny actors, alternative and groundbreaking. I was going to produce beautiful babies. We were going to live in a villa overlooking the sea. There's something to be said for not having a clue. We were going to be magnificent. We married during the storms of 1987. Big dreams were replaced by normal jobs. We were a unit, self-contained, solid. Then this: my infertility. It was devastating. But that was fine, we could adopt. Then this: your new job in theatre. It took you to London, Monday to Friday. You felt too itinerant to commit to the adoption process. I agreed. That could wait. Then this: your secretive, moody self. Your quick temper. Your regular excuses to stay in the capital over the weekend. My conclusion: someone else was getting the smiley side, the nice part of you. I compensated by being nicer. I tried to be prettier. Then this in 2002: your coming-out. I began to realise how truly horrible you'd been to me for years \u2013 the public mateyness, the private bullying (brutal and verbal, once or twice physical) \u2013 so my shock and fear for a lonely future was tempered with a kind of relief. Even so, after you left I crashed via painkillers and alcohol, believing it was my fault. After all, we'd been together for 17 years. My friends gave me their shoulders followed by the wide-eyed, \"How could you not know?\" Yes, how could I not know? A half-hearted suicide attempt led to a spell as an inpatient followed by a year of shame, self-esteem-floor-hitting and general victim status until I was utterly bored by my own miserableness. Counselling helped me realise that the suppression of your sexuality didn't justify your treatment of me all those years. I wish you had acknowledged that you shouldn't have blamed me for expecting you, my husband, to be heterosexual. Still, I can see certain things clear-eyed: I acquiesced on a daily basis, didn't fight my corner. I defended your rudeness to my family and friends, a passivity long-learned from my sweet mum. I see that you could be kind, supporting me through childlessness and the heart-squeezingly awful time of losing my brother, then my change of career (you later claimed you were simply making me strong enough so you could leave). I hope there will be a time when no gay man or woman feels the need to live that lie, to cover thwarted sexuality with anger, to waste their own and a partner's life with promises that will never reach the finishing line, to use unspeakable emotional cruelty against another person they once loved and respected. The divorce papers cited \"unreasonable behaviour\". Er, yes. I know I don't know the full extent of your inner turmoil, only its consequences. I know we've both lived a half-life. We've never had a conversation about any of it. I finally had the courage to ban contact in 2004. I hear you have a new way of living that suits you well but that you've been asking about me. Please be happy. I choose to forget that I was married and that like a punch to the lungs, was floored. I choose to forget you. Now this: I'm with a lovely man, a gentle man. So, thank you.
