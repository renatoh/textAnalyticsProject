The Advertising Standards Authority rejected a complaint from a reader that the advert was demonstrating \"sado-masochistic\" behaviour and was offensive. It said readers of Vogue, where the advert appeared, were sophisticated enough to appreciate its subtlety. The image features Macpherson standing at a kitchen worktop in her underwear preparing to chop meat. On the floor is a selection of vegetables resembling a body, with a cauliflower as the head and other produce as the arms and torso. Vogue told the ASA its readers \"were grown-up, sophisticated and appreciated modern advertising\". The magazine said it found the ad \"attractive, seductive and humorous and hoped its readers would view it the same way\". Bendon, the company that owns the brand, told the watchdog the Elle Macpherson Intimates range used \"highly original imagery\" in its advertisements that \"adopted cinematic themes and genres\". It said the theme of the print campaign was film noir and the company's policy was to present its product in an exciting and provocative manner. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
