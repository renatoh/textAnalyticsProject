The Saints were beaten 43-16 at home by the 2018 winners Leinster, who soaked up pressure and were clinical in attack as they maintained their 100% record in the group. The game was even in terms of territory and possession but after Ahsee Tuala\u2019s early try Northampton became increasingly desperate and were betrayed by basic mistakes. \u201cIt was a step up from the Premiership,\u201d said Northampton\u2019s England flanker Lewis Ludlam. \u201cIt was always going to be given the number of international players in their team. We did not deal with their physicality well enough and if you give a team like that an inch, they are going to take a mile. \u201cI do not think it was a reality check as much as evidence of what happens when you do not turn up. We were inaccurate and failed to turn possession into points by giving the ball away. A team like Leinster will always make you pay for that.\u201d Northampton have an immediate chance for retribution on Saturday when they face Leinster at the Aviva Stadium in the return game. Six years ago they won there the week after being thrashed 40-7 at Franklin\u2019s Gardens to Leinster, the final game in Europe for Leo Cullen, then a second-row and now the province\u2019s director of rugby. \u201cYou have to be careful with these fixtures,\u201d said Cullen. \u201cNormally you play a match and then think about the next team. The head-to-head fixtures in Europe are unique and one thing I have learned is that it does not always transfer to the next week. Northampton were very clever in 2013 and we are taking nothing for granted.\u201d Northampton\u2019s director of rugby, Chris Boyd, is considering making changes to his team with the following rounds of the Premiership in mind. The international forwards Owen Franks and Courtney Lawes, missing on Saturday, will again be absent, along with the second\u2011row Dave Ribbans. \u201cIt will be tough, but we back ourselves against anyone on our day,\u201d said Ludlam. \u201cWe know where we are at as a team and where we want to be. Losing to Leinster was not the end of the world. It was not an awful performance. It was just not quite good enough.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
