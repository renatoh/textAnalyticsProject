They've had a field-day since the transmission of an episode of Brass Eye by Channel 4 in July. It was followed by an orchestrated complaints campaign. Now the Independent Television Commission and the Broadcasting Standards Commission have required the channel to broadcast an apology. Channel 4 has nothing to apologise for. Brass Eye was transmitted late at night with transparent warnings that its content might cause offence. As it happens, the programme itself was a clever, if uncomfortable, exploration of the ludicrous sexualisation of children and voyeuristic 'condemnation' of paedophilia that exists throughout our society nowadays. But opposition to this sort of heavy-handed interference should not be predicated only on high quality. The ITC and the BSC, whose senior figures are all jockeying for position in a proposed new 'super-regulator' OFCOM, are not alone in having made themselves look ridiculous in a bid to impress with their toughness. Politicians, too, have been exposed as foolish by this sorry episode. Ministers David Blunkett, Beverley Hughes and Tessa Jowell all furiously condemned Brass Eye, some without having taken the elementary precaution of watching and listening to it first. Her arrogant reaction has, in particular, seriously dented Ms Jowell's credibility as Culture and Media Secretary only weeks after taking up her new job. We hope in future that she might consider engaging her brain before issuing inflammatory public denunciations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
