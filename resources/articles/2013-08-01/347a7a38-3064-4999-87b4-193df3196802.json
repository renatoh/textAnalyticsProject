Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, will say wages for workers hired on the controversial terms are 40% lower than for those on typical contracts, as the party holds a \"zero-hours summit\" in London with major employers and unions. Analysis of official figures shows staff on zero-hours contracts are on average hired for \u00a39 an hour, compared with an average of \u00a315 an hour for other workers, the party says. Labour is putting pressure on the government to clamp down on abuse of zero-hours contracts, which can mean staff are tied to an employer but not guaranteed any work from one week to the next. Vince Cable, the business secretary, has ordered a review into their use by major companies after it emerged up to a million workers may have been hired on such flexible terms. However, the opposition is also pushing for major companies to improve their employment practices of their own accord. \"New evidence highlights that there could be hundreds of thousands more people on zero-hours contracts than previously thought,\" Umunna said before the conference. \"That's hundreds of thousands of people in insecure work earning far less than average pay. \"Flexibility works for some, but the danger today is that too often insecurity at work becomes the norm. \"The huge spike in the use of zero-hours contracts has brought increased reports of abuses and bad practice. There should be zero tolerance of such abuse. \"That is why Labour has convened this important summit bringing together representatives of employees and employers to consider what action must be taken. In contrast, this Tory-led government has refused to have a proper and full consultation on the rise of zero-hours contracts or to treat this issue with the seriousness which it deserves.\" Separately, Umunna wrote to Sir Andrew Dilnot, chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, to raise concerns that official figures do not reflect the true scale of zero-hours contracts. Earlier this month, it emerged there is a discrepancy between the Office for National Statistics' figure of 250,000 for the number of people thought to be on zero-hours contracts, compared with the one million estimated in a survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. The Guardian has revealed the scale of zero-hours contracts used by a number of major employers, including the Everyman and Curzon cinema chains, retailer Sports Direct, which employs 20,000 staff on zero-hours deals, and fast food chain McDonald's, which employs 82,000 workers on the controversial terms."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
