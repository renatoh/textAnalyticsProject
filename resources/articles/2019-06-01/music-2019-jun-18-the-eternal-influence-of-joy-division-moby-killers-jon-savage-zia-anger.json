Live, Joy Division were heavy. Performers \u2013 and David Bowie is a good example \u2013 know exactly what to give and what to withhold, but [singer] Ian Curtis didn\u2019t have that stagecraft. He just came on and gave everything. That is something that\u2019s not infinitely reproducible. I didn\u2019t know about Ian\u2019s epilepsy at the time. The only person who talked to me about his emotional state was [Factory Records\u2019] Alan Erasmus who said: \u201cThere\u2019s trouble.\u201d When I saw them play at the Factory in April 1980 it was so intense I had to leave. Ian was \u2013 to use that dreadful phrase \u2013 for real, and that intensity was ferocious. Most pop music is about distant emotion. Ian wanted to go very deep, and the band went with him. Equally, I\u2019m afraid the idea of the \u201ctortured poet\u201d and dying young is ingrained in the idea of the teenager, so Ian\u2019s suicide ticks all the boxes of a romantic hero, but it\u2019s a mistake to think Joy Division were doomy. It\u2019s poised between the light and dark and somehow outside of time, so 40 years on they are still up there. Kevin Cummins on Joy Division\u2019s iconic photography I first photographed Warsaw at the Electric Circus and Rafters, when they wore PVC and [bassist] Hooky had a plastic cap. They looked like a prototype Frankie Goes to Hollywood, but once they became Joy Division the music changed dramatically. The lyrics were sombre, so I wanted to create some mythology around them. We all wore our old school jumpers and trousers with army overcoats because we were skint. They looked east European and utilitarian. I didn\u2019t want pictures of them smiling. They weren\u2019t interested in having their photos taken, so you had to create more than a straight band shot. The photograph of them in the snow on the bridge in Hulme was unconventional \u2013 the band were in the distance \u2013 but it looked like Joy Division sounded: bleak, industrial, full of space, like postwar Pozna\u0144. When I shot Ian for NME in the overcoat, smoking, looking into the camera, the rest of them were trying to make him laugh. But once they saw how they looked, they became the characters in the photographs on stage. Music press photographers used black and white then because NME printed in monochrome, which gives those photos a timeless quality. You see that look everywhere now and countless groups have asked me to replicate the bridge shot but you can\u2019t. I always tell the band I rescued them \u2013 left to their own devices, they\u2019d have ended up looking like Bon Jovi. Moby on Joy Division\u2019s influence on dance and electronic producers From the cover art to the Sylvia Plath-esque lyrics to the detuned pianos on side two, Closer is a perfect album. In 1981, my friend Dave bought it and let me tape it. I remember hearing Atrocity Exhibition (which we all thought was called \u201castro-city exhibition\u201d) and even before it was finished I\u2019d fallen in love with Joy Division. I spent more time in high school listening to them than I did with my friends and family and the band are a huge influence [on me]. Sonically \u2013 for the way in which they melded traditional instruments with synthesisers and drum machines \u2013 thematically and even aesthetically. I spent years wishing I could live in the empty warehouse where they shot the Love Will Tear Us Apart video and then, lo and behold, I spent years living in empty warehouses. In many ways it\u2019s hard to separate Joy Division from New Order, who inspired all of the early techno and house producers, myself included \u2013 I\u2019ve covered New Dawn Fades. Joy Division continue to resonate because of that combination of beauty and brutality. Ian managed to beautifully express what so many of us are unable to. Zoe Lambert on channelling Joy Division into fiction Growing up in Manchester, Joy Division were part of the musical landscape. When editor Richard V Hirst was approaching writers for the book We Were Strangers: Stories Inspired by Unknown Pleasures, he said my writing had a northern grimness which reminded him of their music. I was told to choose a song and write a story. I chose She\u2019s Lost Control because the subject matter \u2013 a woman with epilepsy \u2013 dovetailed with things I\u2019d been writing about, such as disability, caring and illness. I listened to Unknown Pleasures while writing. The beat of She\u2019s Lost Control is powerful, like a heartbeat. The song has scenes in the lyrics: \u201cShe walked upon the edge of no escape / And laughed \u2018I\u2019ve lost control.\u2019\u201d I was interested in the myth of Ian Curtis \u2013 the broody young man \u2013 but also, he was married with a baby, and worked as a disablement resettlement officer. The song is almost a memorial about a girl who came in looking for a job and then died. We don\u2019t know her name, that really touched me, and I was thinking about how it impacted him when he developed epilepsy. I wanted to write a story that gave her something \u2013 she finds a job \u2013 but with Joy Division\u2019s element of teenage yearning and desire to leave a mark. The publisher\u2019s fiction editor, Tim Shearer, was at the same school as Ian. He had a fan club even then. Director Zia Anger on how Joy Division influenced her film, I Remember Nothing In 2007, my father took me to see the film Control because we\u2019d learned that somebody in our family had epilepsy, this mysterious disease that is never talked about. The movie was the only time I\u2019d seen a cinematic depiction of epilepsy that didn\u2019t sensationalise it, so when I was making a film about it I started listening to Unknown Pleasures. The song I Remember Nothing was lyrically amazing, and the title fitted a moment in my script where the character says: \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d The script is based on the five stages of a grand mal seizure. I was interested in discussing something unspeakable or unknowable through a creative lens, like Ian was doing. Lack of sleep, alcohol and lights all trigger seizures, so how hard it must be to have this happening for just doing what every other young person is doing. The depression that must result from that really resonated with me, but going back to the lyrics and realising that he was trying to process what was happening to him was powerfully inspiring. The lyrics to I Remember Nothing have the poetry that I wanted the character to have, and capture the mystery of being human. I just hope people don\u2019t show up thinking it\u2019s a Joy Division movie. Curator Matthew Higgs on Joy Division\u2019s influence on visual artists and designers I grew up near Preston, so saw Joy Division at least five times when I was 14 or 15. I saw the Bury riot gig and the Preston show, a famous bootleg. We used to watch them rehearse on Sunday afternoons. When they went to the pub they\u2019d leave us with their instruments and let us play them. They were unusually accommodating. I went to art school, became director of exhibitions at the Institute of Contemporary Arts and moved to New York to curate at the White Columns gallery because of Joy Division. They were ordinary people who did something extraordinary and after seeing them live, something fundamentally shifted in our aspirations. In 2017, I organised the True Faith exhibition in Manchester with Jon Savage and Johan Kugelberg to draw attention to how Joy Division function as a catalyst for all kinds of people: film-makers, photographers, clothes designers, and artists such as Martin Boyce, Jeremy Deller and Mark Leckey. Glenn Brown dedicated his first three years\u2019 work to Ian and Julian Schnabel made a painting based on the cover of Closer. Our world wouldn\u2019t look the way it does without what [Joy Division sleeve designer] Peter Saville was doing in Manchester. I don\u2019t think we\u2019d have got to art without their help. Tim Burgess on how Joy Division shaped independent music Unknown Pleasures is one of my most played records. When I used to listen to it through headphones, trying to understand it, it used to put me in a trance: it did something to me. My friends called it \u201cvampire music\u201d. One of my first bands were called Interzone and we did a cover of New Dawn Fades. Ian is a major influence, as a singer and lyrically; if I try to borrow anything from him directly it doesn\u2019t fit into what I do but he is my favourite frontman. Joy Division created a blueprint for how a band could operate independently. Growing up in Manchester and Cheshire, the fact that they were from Salford and Macclesfield, on an independent label, doing it with their mates, inspired me to form a band with my closest friends, be on an independent and with Closer engineer Chris Nagle producing. I felt I was doing what I\u2019d been taught. Like Joy Division and New Order, I still try to make every setlist different and go with the feeling. I have a tattoo of FAC 33 \u2013 Ceremony, written by Joy Division, performed by New Order, on Factory Records \u2013 on my shoulder bone. It\u2019s recognising something I carry with me for ever. Dr Jennifer Otter Bickerdike on Joy Division\u2019s impact on academia I grew up in an Italian Catholic family [in California] where you were supposed to turn to God. I\u2019d had a bit of abuse in my family background and God hadn\u2019t helped but Ian\u2019s vocals touched something deep and dark in me that nothing else could. I\u2019d thought about killing myself lots of times but listening to that music and that voice, I still felt lonely, but not alone. When one of my best friends was murdered, I could not get far enough away. I sold everything to go to England and did a PhD on Joy Division to get a British passport. People at Goldsmith\u2019s thought I was nuts but Joy Division are a gift for academics. I interviewed 28 tribute bands, some as far away as Iran, and today, conferences attract academics from all over the world. The story is uncomfortable \u2013 troubled young man makes beautiful music and no one discovers what it means until he kills himself \u2013 but Ian meant what he was singing. I relate Joy Division to Siegfried Kracauer\u2019s theory, The Mass Ornament \u2013 they are like the centre of a wheel and so much is connected to them. The Killers\u2019 Dave Keuning on Joy Division\u2019s legacy to rock guitarists Growing up in middle America, I heard New Order on the radio and worked backwards. The guitar lines in Joy Division are really interesting which is why they\u2019ve inspired generations of guitarists. There\u2019s a lot of rough, out of tune, almost clean but with slightly dirty amps, and stark, angular playing. Bernard Sumner is kind of an underrated guitar player because he\u2019s become known as a singer, but he\u2019s a huge influence on me and you can definitely hear Joy Division all over the Killers. [Director] Anton Corbijn asked us to cover Shadowplay for Control and we loved doing it so much it stayed in the live set. Theirs is stark and monochrome, very late-70s Manchester. We did our own version but if I cover it again I might learn Bernard\u2019s guitar solo note for note, just to play homage. The Killers got their name from a New Order video and I used to play Crystal a lot in soundcheck, so playing it with them on stage felt like coming full circle. All my friends who know about Joy Division tend to have become musicians or creatives. I don\u2019t meet many average people into Joy Division. Tim Marshall on how Love Will Tear Us Apart became a terrace favourite Manchester United fans started singing \u201cGiggs will tear you apart again\u201d to the tune of Love Will Tear Us Apart when Ryan Giggs was [interim] manager in 2014. Most pop songs that become football chants are big commercial hits \u2013 think of White Stripes\u2019 Seven Nation Army or Slade songs in the 1970s. It\u2019s more unusual for a chant to come from alternative music, especially from a band not exactly known for exuberance. With Joy Division being from Salford and Macclesfield, they lend themselves to being sung at Manchester United, but now lots of other clubs have versions of the chant. When opposition fans taunted \u201cLeeds are falling apart again\u201d at my team, Leeds United, our fans adopted it ironically and now sing it when they\u2019re winning. I doubt if many people chanting it own Unknown Pleasures or Closer, but Love Will Tear Us Apart is an easy, melodic tune with simple repetitive words. It\u2019s tailor-made for chanting. \u2022 Jon Savage\u2019s oral history of Joy Division This Searing Light, the Sun and Everything Else is published by Faber.
