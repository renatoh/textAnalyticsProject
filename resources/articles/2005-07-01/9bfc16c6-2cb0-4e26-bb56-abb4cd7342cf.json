The media and education group has been conducting a search for a new chairman since February when Lord Stevenson announced he was stepping down from the board after 19 years. Mr Gibson-Smith is thought to be one of a number of candidates being considered for the Pearson role. The change at the top comes at a difficult time in the group's history. The structure of the group - which as well as the Financial Times owns Penguin books and US education businesses - is being questioned by investors. Some investors have suggested that the FT, its so-called trophy asset, might be worth more to another owner. When Lord Stevenson chaired his last Pearson annual shareholder meeting in April he admitted that strategic options were being considered \"very carefully\". The search for his successor is still thought to be a long way from being concluded and is being led by Lord Burns, the Abbey National chairman and senior independent director at Pearson. Mr Gibson-Smith, who began his career at oil company BP in 1970, holds non-executive directorships at Lloyds TSB and British Land, where Lord Burns is also a director. A geologist, he worked around the world with BP and managed divisions in the UK and the US. Pearson refused to comment yesterday, but it has indicated, that any candidate will need an \"international perspective\". It is expected to consult its major City shareholders on its choice after a recent disagreement over an unusual share award for Lord Stevenson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
