Its premise \u2013 an injured soldier in Vietnam becomes best friends with a labrador \u2013 suggests an onslaught of greasy sentimentality sickly enough to give you gastroenteritis. There is no way on earth you\u2019d pay to see Finding Jack. Or maybe there is. What if we amended Finding Jack\u2019s premise to \u201can injured soldier in Vietnam becomes best friends with a labrador, plus James Dean stars from beyond the grave as a crime against God\u201d? Of course you\u2019d watch that. You\u2019d watch it just to see if it was as distressing as it sounds. Luckily, it\u2019s happening. Yesterday, the Hollywood Reporter announced that the family of James Dean have given permission to allow their iconic ancestor to be digitally resurrected for a secondary lead role in Finding Jack. \u201cThe family views this as his fourth movie, a movie he never got to make,\u201d said film-maker Anton Ernst in a statement. \u201cWe do not intend to let his fans down.\u201d What great news! They\u2019re taking the likeness of a long-dead actor and feeding it into a technology largely known for producing creepy, waxy, lifeless monstrosities so that it can lumber through a terrible, legacy-destroying film while an impressionist makes it perform dialogue about how nice dogs are. Realistically, the film-makers would be better served by digging up James Dean\u2019s body, dressing it in an army uniform and jerking it about on wires. But, hey, at least they don\u2019t intend to let his fans down. This has been coming for a long time. Those old arch enemies Marvel and Martin Scorsese have both found potential in digital de-ageing, even though \u2013 given Robert De Niro\u2019s upsetting Polar Express eyes in The Irishman, Samuel L Jackson\u2019s weirdly exhausted-looking Nick Fury in Captain Marvel and that one shot of Michael Douglas looking like he was melting in Avengers: Endgame \u2013 the process has clearly yet to be perfected. And while Star Wars brought Peter Cushing back from the dead for Rogue One, the end result was distracting at best and the actual stuff of nightmares at worst. And Cushing was playing a character that he\u2019d already played before, so at least there was a modicum of artistic leeway there. James Dean, meanwhile \u2013 who died before the Vietnam war began \u2013 will be playing a role in a film he has absolutely no relationship with. The bad news is that CMG Worldwide, which own the rights to Dean\u2019s likeness, sees this as a gateway to bring back some of its other dead clients. If Finding Jack is a success, it paves the way for a rash of films starring nightmarish digital versions of Aaliyah or Jack Lemmon or Maya Angelou. The good news is that Finding Jack is never going to be made. Never ever. Look at it this way: nobody wanted to make The Irishman because the technology was too expensive. And that\u2019s a film by the world\u2019s greatest living director starring the world\u2019s two most celebrated actors. It\u2019s the closest you will ever find to a sure thing, and it still almost didn\u2019t happen. Meanwhile, Finding Jack\u2019s directors are listed as Anton Ernst and Tati Golykh, two people who have never directed a feature film of any description, even with actors who are all alive. Ernst is best known for producing a 2004 Jean-Claude Van Damme film called Wake of Death, and one of Golykh\u2019s IMDb photos is of her shooting a gun in a bra. It is never going to happen. Nobody in their right mind would ever finance such a risk. I\u2019ll eat my hat if it ever sees the light of day. Still, at least this is a sign that the days of Hollywood getting a James Dean type by hiring James Franco are over. It might be morally bankrupt, but at least it isn\u2019t stupid."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
