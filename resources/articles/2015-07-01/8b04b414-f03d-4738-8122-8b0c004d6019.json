DfID is increasingly targeting private sector investment, which the international development secretary Justine Greening has said will help to end aid dependency in poor countries. \u201cThere is clear evidence to show that economic development is the only way we can ultimately defeat poverty,\u201d Greening said in a written ministerial statement. The investment, which marks Britain\u2019s first capital injection into CDC for two decades, will be taken out of DfID\u2019s existing budget, which is \u00a310.04bn in this financial year. The department will transfer \u00a3450m this year and \u00a3285m in the 2016/17 financial year. \u201cThis will ensure countries can grow and trade their way out of poverty while building future markets that British businesses can compete in,\u201d DfID said. CDC invests in businesses in Africa and south Asia with the aim of creating jobs and spurring economic development in the world\u2019s poorest nations. It has investments in more than 1,300 companies in 74 countries and net assets of \u00a33.4bn. CDC has been criticised for pouring funding into gated communities, shopping centres and luxury property in poor countries. \u201cCDC have a track record of ploughing money into dubious \u2018aid\u2019 projects like the Garden City luxury housing and shopping complex in Kenya and a luxury hotel in Lagos, Nigeria, which costs $400 a night to stay in,\u201d said Alex Scrivener, a policy officer at advocacy group Global Justice Now. \u201cThese projects are an insult to the millions of people who live in these places without decent housing.\u201d As much as \u00a32.8tn of investments in businesses is needed to develop the world\u2019s highest risk sectors and countries every year, Greening said, adding that this funding shortfall is \u201ckeeping countries locked into poverty\u201d. The announcement comes as the third financing for development conference draws to an end in Addis Ababa, where leaders struck an agreement on how to fund sustainable development over the next 15 years. Greening said: \u201cThis is a historic international deal that takes us beyond aid. It is the first ever agreement that allows us to harness private sector investment and developing countries\u2019 domestic resources, including tax revenues, to turbo-charge development.\u201d In May, the Independent Commission for Aid Impact, the UK aid watchdog, criticised DfID for ramping up spending on private sector programmes that do not have a clear focus on reducing poverty. Mary Creagh, the shadow international development secretary, said: \u201cA thriving private sector is vital to the elimination of poverty. But the government\u2019s own aid watchdog gave their private sector aid spending an amber-red rating and warned that ministers lack targets and a clear focus on reducing poverty. \u201cMinisters must ensure this new investment in the CDC is transparent, focused on helping the poorest people in the world and delivers value for money for British taxpayers.\u201d CDC said it had helped to created nearly 1.3m direct and indirect jobs in the past year, adding that companies it invested in paid \u00a31.5bn in tax revenues to governments in Africa and south Asia. Diana Noble, CDC\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cA job is the best route out of poverty, and we know from experience that people in developing countries have the vision and drive to build the businesses to provide these jobs. What\u2019s lacking is long-term, supportive investors with experience, and this is where CDC can make a difference.\u201d Scrivener said: \u201cPushing hundreds of millions of pounds towards the private sector like this at best seems like a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money and at worst could end up actually causing more harm than good in the global south.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
