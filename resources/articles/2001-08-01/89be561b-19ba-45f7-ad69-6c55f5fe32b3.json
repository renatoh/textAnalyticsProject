That it does is largely due to the electricity generated by the artists, though the time lag means that Berlioz's juxtaposition of war-torn Troy with Carthaginian stability partly loses its effect. One of the work's principal themes is the destruction of an Edenic society by the straggling survivors of a distant conflict. Without the cataclysm fresh in our minds, this point is easily lost. Donald Runnicles's conducting does, however, get the message across. He establishes Carthaginian opulence by stressing the sensuality of Berlioz's orchestral colouring. The moment the Trojans arrive, brass-drenched gloom hovers over everything like a pall. The passion of Dido and Aeneas is at once ecstatic and consuming. At the end of the work, the stridency of war is in the offing again. But what makes this an extraordinary evening is Lorraine Hunt Lieberson's Dido, the greatest performance of the role I have ever heard. Its force derives from her ability to generate emotion by the sparsest of means. A simple walk across the platform denotes majesty. The droop of her head indicates anguish. Phrases and words are etched with immaculate restraint until she gets to the final scene, when Dido's cries of misery seem ripped from her. She delivers the final prophecy in a voice that both is and is not her own. Hugh Smith's Aeneas is both heroic and cruel, his glamorous tenor negotiating Berlioz's high-lying vocal lines with ease. The rest of the casting - including John Mark Ainsley (no less) as Hylas - can only be described as luxurious. Outstanding stuff.
