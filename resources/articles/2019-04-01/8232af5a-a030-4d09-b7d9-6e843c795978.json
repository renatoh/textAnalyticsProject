The Late Late Show host, 40, said that \u201cfat\u201d actors have to accept in film or on TV that \u201ccertainly no one ever finds you attractive\u201d. Speaking to the actor David Tennant on his podcast, David Tennant Does a Podcast With, Corden said that overweight people are, at best, cast as the funny friend of someone who is \u201cattractive\u201d. He said that such characters \u201cnever really fall in love\u201d and \u201cnever have sex\u201d. Speaking of his breakthrough while he was performing in Alan Bennett\u2019s The History Boys in 2004, Corden said: \u201cI was in the play with seven other boys who were at a similar age and a similar place in our careers, and pretty much every day, three or four of these boys would come in with a massive film script under their arm.\u201d For one role, \u201cthey were looking for two boys of 21 and 22 and [two others] got sent the script [for lead roles] and I got sent just two pages to play a newsagent at the start of this film,\u201d he said. \u201cI really felt like people were going, \u2018We think you\u2019re quite good. It\u2019s just because of what you look like.\u2019\u201d Corden said that larger actors are often typecast. \u201cYou will be good friends with people who are attractive and will perhaps chip in with the odd joke every now and again,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you get older, you\u2019ll probably be a judge in something or you\u2019ll be dropping off a television to a handsome person in a sitcom.\u201d Corden\u2019s beliefs are echoed by studies on the topic. American research has shown that the under-representation of overweight people on prime-time television has fuelled discriminatory attitudes in the general public. In terms of gender, this bias affects women more than men, and wider studies have found that media narratives on obesity continue to fuel the inequality. Establishing his career in the early 2000s sitcom Fat Friends, Corden has previously spoken of weight discrimination in a 2016 interview with Rolling Stone. \u201cI could never understand, when I watch romantic comedies,\u201d he said, \u201cthe notion that for some reason unattractive or heavy people don\u2019t fall in love. If they do, it\u2019s in some odd, kooky, roundabout way \u2013 and it\u2019s not.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
