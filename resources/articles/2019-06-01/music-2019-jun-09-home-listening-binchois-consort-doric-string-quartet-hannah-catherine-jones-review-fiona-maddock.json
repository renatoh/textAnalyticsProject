As part of their ongoing series exploring the link between English alabaster and medieval music (to summarise a quite subtle idea), the Binchois Consort has created a programme of early polyphony \u2013 Music for Saint Katherine (Hyperion) \u2013 associated with the virgin-martyr, object of a cult in England after 1066. The best-known composer is Dunstaple (c1390-1453), represented by the devotional Gaude virgo salutata, and the more elaborate motet Salve scema sanctitatis. With works by Walter Frye (d.1475) and others, and images in the CD booklet of Katherine\u2019s martyrdom depicted in alabaster, this disc rewards detailed attention. It\u2019s sung with grace and finesse by this ensemble of six male voices, directed by Andrew Kirkman. \u2022 Last October the Doric String Quartet played all Britten\u2019s works for string quartet, together with five Purcell Fantasias, in Snape Maltings, the Suffolk concert hall indelibly associated with the composer. Those enthralling performances are now available on a two-disc Chandos set, as fresh and immediate as they were live. From the Three Divertimenti, a restless appetiser dating from the 1930s, to the middle-period Quartets 1 and 2 and the late, ethereal anguish of No 3, this music spans the full technical and emotional range. The Dorics (with violist H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cl\u00e9ment playing Britten\u2019s viola) captures every mood, from steely to poetic to tragic, the structure of each work ever clear. Essential listening. \u2022 From pineapple orchestra to ping-pong machine and hurdy gurdy, composer and artist Hannah Catherine Jones, founder of the iconoclastic Peckham Chamber Orchestra, goes on an aural tour of new instruments and their inventors in her Seriously\u2026 podcast, The Prototype. Don\u2019t be a slouch. Check out the weird and wonderful sounds of the future."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
