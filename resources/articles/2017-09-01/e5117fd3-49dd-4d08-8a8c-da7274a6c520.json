England\u2019s lead was only one until four minutes from the end when Ryan Bertrand doubled it, with Southgate\u2019s team scoring twice more in stoppage time through Danny Welbeck and Harry Kane to give the scoreline a more emphatic feel. Yet many of the 3,700 visiting fans had made clear their dissatisfaction during a sterile and goalless first half and plenty more had vacated their seats in the north stand of this arena and departed long before the final whistle. \u201cI\u2019ve played in matches like this and, if you don\u2019t get a couple of early goals, the atmosphere can turn,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cBut that\u2019s part of wearing the shirt. You have to deal with that. \u201cWhen that opening goal doesn\u2019t come, playing against a packed defence, you\u2019ve got to show some real courage and stick to the game plan, be patient, and wait for your opportunities. If you keep the ball as we did, moving the opposition, it generally comes off. \u201cIf Germany had played here, we\u2019d look at the scoreline, see 4-0 and think they\u2019ve done a professional job. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done in the end. It took a while to get the goals but we dominated the game and we had over 70% of the possession. \u201cThere\u2019s very little space to play against their 5-4-1. The expectation is high that you\u2019ll run away with the game. But two years ago Italy were 0-0 here at 70 minutes and only won 1-0 in the end. You don\u2019t run through them. But I understand the reaction. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it happen [fans turning on the team]. From our point of view, we have to focus on sticking to the plan, staying calm. I understand if we don\u2019t score until late the game feels different for everybody. But I\u2019ve played in so many qualifiers and watched many qualifiers, and I don\u2019t remember many being free-flowing champagne football. \u201cWhen there\u2019s no space to play, you have to work the opportunities. I\u2019m really pleased with what the players have done. They\u2019ve kept their focus, kept calm, and got their rewards.\u201d Kane, after yet another scoreless August, registered twice after the interval with England more threatening against a team ranked 190 in the world following the introduction of Marcus Rashford at the break. \u201cWhenever you come away to games like this it\u2019s never going to be easy from the start but we knew we had to keep moving it and that the spaces would open and the chances would come,\u201d said the Tottenham Hotspur forward, who has five goals under Southgate\u2019s stewardship. \u201cAll 10 or 11 players are behind the ball and you have to make sure your passes are spot on. \u201cThey probably weren\u2019t in the first half but we just knew if we kept moving it wide and creating the space we\u2019d get chances and that\u2019s what happened. \u201cThe manager makes his choices [on tactics] and puts the team out in a way he thinks is going to be best to win the game. We won 4-0 so he did the job right.\u201d \u201cI genuinely don\u2019t think there is a disconnect with the fans,\u201d added Southgate, whose side can take another major step towards qualifying for the World Cup with victory over second-placed Slovakia on Monday. \u201cOur fans in Scotland [for the 2-2 draw in June] were 100% behind us throughout the game. Maybe the dynamic is a bit different when you go to some venues but so be it. It was important we won this game. We did a professional job.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
