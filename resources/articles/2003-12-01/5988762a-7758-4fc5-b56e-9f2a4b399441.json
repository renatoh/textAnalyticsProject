The makers of Rude Girls spent four months on the trail of girl gangs in Essex and east London. The 90-minute documentary, due to air at 9pm tonight, focused on the behaviour of three pairs of so-called \"rude girls\". But the programme has been pulled at the last minute and replaced with a documentary about royal mistresses because one of the people featured in the show is facing court action. \"A court case is pending and we have had to take the programme off air,\" said a BBC spokesman. \"But the programme will be shown eventually.\" The channel's Guns and Gangs week, part of BBC2's \u00a397m autumn season, features programmes on gun smuggling through eastern Europe and how Britain can learn from Boston's success in reducing gang-related deaths. Two other films, including Guns and Rap on BBC2 at 11.20pm tonight, examine whether rap music contributes to gun crime. Rude Girls has been replaced by a repeat of Royal Mistresses, which first aired on BBC2 in July this year. The documentary compares and contrasts the lives of Camilla Parker Bowles and Alice Keppel, who was the mistress of Edward VII at the turn of the century. Parker Bowles is Keppel's great-granddaughter. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
