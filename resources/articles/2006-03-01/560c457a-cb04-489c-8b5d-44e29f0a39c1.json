After Chris Coleman's Fulham capitulated at this venue seven days ago, David O'Leary's injury-depleted Aston Villa followed suit. A lengthy injury list offered an excuse and a marked second-half improvement prevented Villa from descending into complete embarrassment, but the fact remained that chants of 'We want O'Leary out' rang out from the visiting team's supporters from the moment their team went three goals behind late in the first half and the expression worn by chairman-owner Doug Ellis suggested that those requests were not going unnoted. 'We are giving poor goals away and kicking ourselves in the teeth,' said O'Leary before blaming the club's uncertain ownership status for their on-field mediocrity. 'We're in a period where I know what is needed and the whole club knows what's needed. We've got to see what changes and battle on the best we can. 'I understand the fans' frustration, but I was at Middlesbrough with Steve McClaren a month ago and their fans were doing the same. I'm working with what I've got and I'll carry on until told otherwise.' The rout started after 16 minutes, when James Beattie headed a free-kick from Alan Stubbs into the path of James McFadden, whose superb drive from 20 yards beat Thomas Sorensen. There followed a brief sign of hope for Villa, who pressed Everton into three goalline clearances in quick succession before Beattie flicked on Phil Neville's long throw and McFadden's shot struck a post, rebounding into the path of Tim Cahill to convert into an open goal. Villa went farther behind in the dying seconds of the half when Mikel Arteta's run and cross from the left-hand byline was met at the far post by Leon Osman. Villa improved in the second half, although that was not saying much. Teenage debutant Gabriel Agbonlahor beat Richard Wright's pathetic dive from a tight angle to inject a degree of panic in the home defence and Agbonlahor, Gavin McCann and Luke Moore might have scored before the whistle. Still, a 90th-minute back-heel from McFadden from Neville's free-kick found Cahill, whose devastating 15-yard drive restored a fairer look to the scoreline. More relevantly for Everton, with Birmingham, West Brom and Sunderland yet to visit Goodison, European qualification no longer appears such a forlorn hope. Man of the match - Tim Cahill James Beattie and James McFadden made compelling cases for the honour, but Cahill is one of the Premiership's most underrated midfield forces. Scored twice, had a hand in a second and generally controlled the game from start to finish."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
