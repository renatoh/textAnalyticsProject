It is hoped that harnessing football\u2019s global reach will help clubs train stewards and employees in identifying and combatting antisemitic acts. The 14 signatories of the letter told clubs that the Covid-19 pandemic had led to a rise in antisemitism around the world and said that adopting the IHRA definition would \u201csend out a very strong message about your club\u2019s ethos\u201d. Chelsea became the first sports team to sign up to the IHRA definition in January and Lord John Mann, the UK government\u2019s adviser on antisemitism, told the Guardian the club had demonstrated football\u2019s power to inspire change. \u201cWhat we found with Chelsea is the reach of football is far bigger than other institutions in civil society,\u201d Mann said. \u201cIf a fan sat at home with his club all over his Facebook and Twitter persona is spewing out antisemitism, then if the club challenges it that\u2019s dramatically more powerful. \u201cIf the club gives a message of \u2018These aren\u2019t our values\u2019 and invites the individual in for some education, most people would accept the invitation. We\u2019re getting to people who, perhaps because of their ignorance, are creating distress. It pulls away the majority of people who, when antisemitism is explained to them, don\u2019t want to repeat what they\u2019ve said.\u201d West Ham, Bournemouth, Borussia Dortmund and Tennis Borussia Berlin have followed Chelsea in signing up to the definition. Mann expects more Premier League clubs to sign up before the end of the year. However, he painted a worrying picture about the situation in Europe. \u201cIn Poland, in Lodz, the main term of abuse used is \u2018Jew\u2019 at matches,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Vienna there\u2019s been something similar for many years. The outbreaks of antisemitism in German football have been more disguised because of the German law but remain serious. \u201cIn the Lodz derby supporters abuse the other set with \u2018Juden\u2019 as the main abuse. You get random antisemitic banners at matches with tiny attendances. Why football? Where else do you demonstrate this stuff? In Hungary it\u2019s MTK Budapest, who were very prevalent in their Jewish identity before the war. \u201cGood procedures can isolate and remove the problem. If stewards and clubs know what they\u2019re looking for there won\u2019t be any antisemitic banners. They\u2019ll be removed. Some of it is straightforward. Some of it is more challenging.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
