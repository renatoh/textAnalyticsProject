From this weekend, as the days lengthen and the odds shorten, the game will freewheel towards its various conclusions. The third round of the Cup can kick-start the dullest of seasons, provide an original twist to the most prosaic of plots. This time, however, its most useful role might be to offer a brief period of relative sanity amid the bedlam that is now the Premiership. To be sure, the ties will provide their usual quota of conflict and controversy with the referees getting it in the neck from all sides. But, since no team will see their Champions League chances enhanced or relegation fears increased, the repercussion rating may be low compared with an average Premiership weekend. This would be a relief. Rows and recriminations in the game are scarcely new but it is a hard to remember a season so hell-bent on burying itself in hysterical argument. The present mood of the Premiership is akin to the duchess's kitchen in Alice in Wonderland. The air is thick with flying rhetoric and mutual abuse, cards yellow and red and expletives from stand and bench, while managers complain that they wuz robbed, that referees were conned, that decisions should be ratified by video and that nobody knows anything about the game except them. To all of which the sports pages gleefully echo Carroll's refrain of \"waa, waa, waa\". The press likes a good row story; it always did. And so overheated has the Premiership become that it takes a minimum of time for the media's magnifying glass to turn the tinder of an insignificant spat into a raging brouhaha. Even now football is apt to insist that relatively minor incidents are blown up out of all proportion. But, since the disproportionate inflation has been provided in the first place by the Premiership's conceit of itself, newspapers could argue that their reporters are merely tapping into the regular gas supply. Boxing Day was a good example. In one paper alone the headlines shrieked about \"Vieira's outrage\", \"Seething Souness\", \"Gregory in trouble\" and \"Bassett's rocket\". And that was telling it like it is. By now there can hardly be a Premiership manager who has not publicly attacked match officials after a game. Some are more forbearing than others and few grumble so regularly as Bolton's Sam Allardyce, who booms on like the Black Dyke Mills band. Allardyce may have had a good case when he complained about having two players sent off in Bolton's recent match against Leicester but it still sounded like a routine moan. And when Blackburn's Graeme Souness says that referees do not understand what goes in a football match he might care to reflect that if they did his own playing career would have been reduced by a number of early baths. It needs to be pointed out, for the umpteenth time, that modern football is nothing like as hard as it was in the 50s and before, neither is it as cynically foul-ridden as it became in the late 60s. The tackle from behind which used to take man before ball has virtually been outlawed and defenders who still insist on bringing down potential goalscorers do so at the risk of dismissal. The game is better to watch. Better passing ensures that the ball is more likely to stay in play and, when it is kicked long into touch, the instant availability of another ball minimises the break in the tempo. And, if the restrictions on passing back have reduced the goalkeeper's role as an attacking outlet, at least less time is wasted while he thinks about it. So why does the Premiership appear to be so consistently at odds with itself ? Well, some of the refereeing has not helped. This season the heat was turned up to maximum at the outset with a flurry of red cards for offences that barely warranted the description while Tottenham's Mauricio Taricco was allowed to put Everton's Thomas Gravesen out of action without a peep from David Elleray. \"We're no better off for professional referees,\" declared Souness. Well, it was the fees that changed, not the officials. The clampdown on shirt-pulling has given way to a crusade against diving which, while noble in intent, has proved to be less satisfactory in execution. Even some of our most experienced referees do not appear able to distinguish between a dive, a trip and a stumble. \"This is something we must eradicate from the game,\" declared Paul Durkin after dismissing Arsenal's Giovanni van Bronckhorst for losing his footing at Liverpool. By all means do so, along with the present c ontrol-freakery of Philip Don and the Professional Game Match Officials' Board. Consistency cannot be achieved through conformity since no two matches are alike in mood or content. Once this is appreciated, then what promises to be the best finish to a championship in decades will be remembered more for action than aggravation. It is a faint hope. Thank goodness, in the meantime, for the FA Cup's balmy alternative to the barmpot that is the Premiership."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
