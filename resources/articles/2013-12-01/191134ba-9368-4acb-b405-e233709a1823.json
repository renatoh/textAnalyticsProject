Art theft is probably the crime most difficult to get upset about. Which makes it a good one for Derren Brown to get a bunch of pensioners to perform in his latest TV stunt, Derren Brown: the Great Art Robbery (Channel 4), then. Even so, their reactions on being told what their task would be \u2013 to steal a \u00a3100,000 work by the Chapman Brothers from an exhibition put on by Ivan Massow \u2013 are surprisingly refreshing. \"Wow,\" says Pauline 74, clearly thrilled. \"Fantastic,\" says Joe, 65. \"Yes, certainly,\" says Rachel, 74, politely. Only Tony, 68, is a bit wary, but he soon comes round. The training is fun: our light-fingered silver-haired heroes learn how to steal chips \u2013 like seagulls \u2013 on the Brighton seafront. They learn how to relieve someone of their watch. And they get arrested for tagging an urban wall, though the arresting officers turn out to be actors employed by Derren. Again, it's interesting to see how much they enjoy it. Though undeniably clever, I felt a bit cheated by the stunt, though. Brown wasn't straight with us all the way through. He withheld crucial information, about Joe being half of a pair of identical twins. For me, what should have been slack-jawed amazement was more like a feeling of crossness at having been conned. And Derren had taken up a lot of my time in doing so. Oh, and the little morality lecture at the end was a bit hard to stomach. \"We might like our future selves to be respected, and treated with the dignity they deserve, and doing that might be one of the clearest celebrations of humanity we know\u2026\" Oh shut up Derren, you're in no position to tell anyone how to behave, you're practically the antichrist. If there is a lesson that comes out of this, it's that if you're old and a bit bored and fed up, turn to crime \u2013 it's a larf, innit. The Chapman Brothers' picture was returned. But I'm rather hoping that Pauline, Joe, Rachel and Tony didn't leave it at that. Who knows \u2013 perhaps they've now each got themselves half a Damien Hirst spot painting on the living room wall."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
