Sources from Iran's judiciary told the news channel Irinn that Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal, both 29, described as \"US hikers\", have each been imprisoned for three years for illegally entering Iran, and a further five years each for spying on behalf of the US intelligence services. The channel said the men, who had already been held for two years, have 20 days to appeal against the verdict, which was issued by the a branch of the revolutionary court. Their lawyer, Masoud Shafii, said he had not yet been informed of the court's verdict, an Iranian news website, Khabaronline, reported. In July 2009, Bauer and Fattal along with their friend, Sarah Shourd, 33, were arrested by Iranian security forces after walking across an unmarked border between Iran and Iraqi Kurdistan. Shourd was released last September on health grounds, on bail of $500,000 (\u00a3324,000). While in prison, Shourd became engaged to Bauer. The Americans have denied that the two men were involved in espionage and say they unwittingly crossed the unmarked border while hiking, after stepping off a dirt track near a waterfall. But Iran accused them of spying. The trial of the two Americans ended last month. Speculation was rife that Iran might release them on the eve of the Islamic month of Ramadan. At the time Iran's foreign minister said the trial could clear the way for their freedom. The court, which was held behind closed doors, had also summoned Shourd but she did not travel to Iran to appear for the trial. The families of the Americans have been campaigning for their release and were allowed to see them in a highly publicised visit to Tehran last year. Bauer's mother, Cindy Hickey, said in July that she had seen \"positive comment\" coming out of Tehran, and hoped they would be freed shortly. In June, Shafii told the New York Times that he had not been able to meet with the two men since taking up their case in late 2009. He accused Iran of holding them hostage. \"There is no espionage or illegal entry evidence against my clients. This case is political and unfortunately my clients have been held hostage, and they have become playthings for the government. \"From a political view, however, my clients should not even be held even one more day, as this detainment is hurting the reputation of the Islamic Republic of Iran,\" Shafii told the newspaper in an email interview. The case has further aggravated tensions between Iran and the US, which have become strained over Iran's nuclear programme. The US accuses Iran of pursuing nuclear weapons. Iran says it is enriching uranium for energy purposes only."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
