After dominating much of yesterday's match and profiting from Kasey Keller's contribution to the weekend's list of goalkeeping gaffes, Leicester were beaten by two goals in the last 11 minutes as Tottenham rediscovered their touch. Spurs have now won three games and drawn another since David Pleat emerged from the back room after the dismissal of Glenn Hoddle. Ironically it took an inspired shot from Mbulelo Mabizela, a defender who caught Hoddle's eye during the pre-season tour in South Africa, to bring Tottenham into a contest which was slipping away from them. Equally crucial, however, was Pleat's decision to replace Rohan Ricketts with St\u00e9phane Dalmat for the second half. Dalmat, a Frenchman on loan from Internazionale, gave their movements greater urgency and added width. And he it was who set up Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9's winning goal. Leicester suffered their fourth successive Premiership defeat without ever looking like a losing team. Their football lacked nothing in effort and they played to strengths but, when Spurs eventually coordinated, they could not cope. Yet for more than an hour they did well enough as Muzzy Izzet and Riccardo Scimeca denied Spurs time and space, providing a solid platform for Paul Dickov and Les Ferdinand. With Keith Gillespie turning Mauricio Taricco on the right and James Scowcroft dominating Stephen Carr on the left, Keller and the centre-backs, Dean Richards and Gary Doherty, frequently found themselves under pressure. Few could dispute the justice of the 1-0 lead Leicester held at half-time, even if the way they acquired it was a mite fortunate. Taricco had just denied Dickov a shot after a high pass from Alan Rogers had sent the striker clear when an even longer ball from Ian Walker caught Spurs out again. This time Dickov managed a shot but straight at the goalkeeper Keller, who was nutmegged. At that point it was hard to see where Spurs were going to find salvation. Dalmat made an immediate difference but for a long time Walker's most urgent save was to keep out a ricochet off a team-mate, Gillespie. Then Pleat added Bobby Zamora to his attack and replaced Gus Poyet with Mabizela, and Spurs gained serious momentum. Had Dickov not delayed his shot in the 78th minute, when he might have passed to the better placed Marcus Bent, Leicester might still have won. As it was, Spurs drew level a minute later. Astute passing by Darren Anderton, Robbie Keane and Zamora found Mabizela advancing towards the arc and the South African's shot rocketed past Walker. \"He's a lovely boy, hasn't smiled since he's been here,\" was Pleat's comment on Mabizela, who presumably permitted himself a mild grin yesterday. A draw would have lifted Leicester off the bottom but their continued pursuit of the win was understandable. Either way Spurs found space where they had earlier been crowded out and it brought them an unlikely victory. Dalmat gathered a pass from Zamora on the left and sidestepped Frank Sinclair before beating Walker with a shot which rebounded off the far post. Kanout\u00e9 drove in the rebound and there was barely time left for Izzet's late tackle to send him away on a stretcher with a damaged ankle. \"Players are funny people,\" Pleat reflected. \"Losing 1-0 inspires them to attack. Perhaps I'll have to persuade them that they're losing 1-0 from the start.\" He could afford a touch of humour. For Leicester the season is starting to wear a permanent frown.
