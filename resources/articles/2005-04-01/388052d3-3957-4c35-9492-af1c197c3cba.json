Reviews of the Cumbria-born, Brighton-based band only ever seem to bolster this image, which makes me suspect that the whole thing is a ruse: that they are in fact normal young men simply interested in healthy outdoor pursuits like ornithology and fell-walking. As it happens, they are very eccentric. And there appears to be nothing healthy about them whatsoever. To an extent it is bad timing on our part. It is the afternoon after the band's biggest London concert to date, and we're in the living room of the flat of guitarist Hamilton Wilkinson and keyboard player Eamon Hamilton. The gigantic overflowing ashtray and the empty bottles of scotch help account for the fact that both appear to be struggling to get to grips with the faculty of speech, and that Wilkinson's brother Yan has forgotten to turn up at all. Although both Wilkinson and Hamilton are courteous and charming, they are in no fit state to welcome visitors to their chaotic home. Wilkinson spends most of the afternoon lying under a duvet on the sofa looking sorry for himself, partly because he is suffering from a sprained wrist after unwisely executing a karate kick at a stuffed deer the night before. Hamilton sets up a temperamental old record player in order to demonstrate the high points of their shared collection, but his occasional comments only serve to confuse. Pointing to an album by the Band, he says: \"They're just totally browning it in the woods!\" before returning to rummage through the dusty vinyl. Hamilton is relegated to album-finding duties while Wilkinson does his best to hold forth. \"There were a lot of arctic winds in the barn in Sussex where we recorded the album,\" he offers to explain why their second album, Open Season, is so preoccupied with climatic conditions. \"Ordinance Survey map walkers are a different breed from us,\" he comments on the band's image as ramblers. \"It's always good to go walking, though, isn't it? Unless your mate breaks her leg.\" He recalls a recent walk on the Sussex Downs where a friend fell out of a tree that Wilkinson had convinced her to climb, resulting in an emergency airlift by helicopter. \"To make matters worse,\" he adds, ruefully, \"we were on magic mushrooms at the time.\" Wilkinson rolls a joint while Hamilton digs out a few of their favourite records. These include a Canadian roots album called Hot Spit by Humphrey and the Dumptrucks (\"heartwarming stuff\" according to Wilkinson), a collection of traditional songs by the Russian Balaika Ensemble and Kings of Metal by the 1980s heavy rock band Manowar. Then a cheerful man called Keith appears holding Kenny Rogers' first album, which he has just bought in a charity shop for 50p. Keith is the band's spiritual guru. He arrived in Brighton from a Welsh village two years ago, and he has either been sleeping under the pier or inside a Wendy House in a playground ever since. \"He's a proper bohemian,\" says Wilkinson. \"He would have got on well with the beat poets.\" Keith, Wilkinson and Hamilton share joints and appear to communicate without the use of language, while a fourth, unnamed, silent man stares at a computer screen. It's like an extension of college life, though the BSP members abandoned their studies many years earlier. More records are presented including Psychocandy by the Jesus and Mary Chain - \"a huge influence on us\" - and Philosophy of the World by the Shaggs, an album made by three American sisters in the late 1960s under the iron will of their dictatorial father, often cited as the worst album ever made. \"You get more for your money with vinyl,\" says Wilkinson about his record collection. \"I'll see a nice cover and go for that - I remember buying the Wurzels from a jumble sale when I was 10.\" The record collection in the flat is rather like BSP itself: arcane, esoteric and random. Hamilton digs out everything from the US 1980s indie band Galaxie 500 to the clean-cut 1960s harmony group the Four Freshmen - and Wilkinson quietly reflects on the joys of rummaging through jumble sales and charity shops and coming home with chance finds. \"You never know what you're going to end up with,\" he says. \"It makes you realise how strange the world is.\" Need to know First record bought: the Wurzels Favourite film: Strike by Eisenstein Record to grab in an emergency: Grey Goose by Leadbelly Inspiration: the countryside Recent discovery: Chet Baker"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
