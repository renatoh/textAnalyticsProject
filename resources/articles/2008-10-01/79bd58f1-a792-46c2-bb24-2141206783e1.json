Here are the recipes for you to try at home - just try not to eat more than one a day. Chocolate fudge cake by Michael Caines Ingredients 225g plain dark chocolate 225g unsalted butter 345g caster sugar 6 eggs, separated into yolks and whites 120g ground almonds 145g soft white breadcrumbs 30g plain flour 2tbsp vanilla essence Icing 85g cocoa powder 255g icing sugar 130g butter 170g caster sugar 6tbsp water Preheat the oven to 160\u00b0C/gas 3. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler, or in a bowl placed over a pan of boiling water. In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and the sugar until white and soft. Add the egg yolks gradually, one by one, then add the almonds and beat them in. Gently fold in the chocolate with a spoon, then add the bread crumbs, flour and vanilla essence and mix together. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites, along with a pinch of sugar, until stiff - but do not over-beat. Fold the egg whites into the cake mixture and then pour the mixture into a buttered 26cm cake tin (lined with paper). Place in the oven and cook for one hour. During this time make the icing. Place the cocoa powder and the icing sugar in a mixing bowl. Warm together the butter, sugar and water until dissolved. Add the liquid into the dry mixture and mix together for a thick but 'pourable' consistency. Once the cake has cooked and cooled, pour over the cake. Top tip Always use dark chocolate, as opposed to milk, when cooking and baking because it provides the desired taste and texture for a recipe. Chocolate cake with raspberry ganache by Alan Coxon Ingredients 200g dark 70% chocolate 200g unsalted butter cut in pieces 125ml strong espresso style coffee 85g self-raising flour 85g plain flour 0.25tsp baking powder 200g dark moist muscovado sugar 200g golden caster sugar 25g coco powder 3 medium free range eggs 1tsp natural yoghurt 4tbsp grated divine dark chocolate to decorate plus butter for greasing Raspberry ganache: 200g 70% dark chocolate 285ml double cream, 2tbsp golden caster sugar 150g fresh raspberries Preheat the oven to 160\u00b0C/gas 3. Butter a 20cm round cake tin (7.5cm deep) and line the base. Break the chocolate into pieces and place into a heatproof bowl and sit on top of a pan half filled with hot water, ensuring that the water does not touch the base of the bowl. Add the butter, the warm coffee and heat everything together gently in the double boiler just until everything is melted taking care not to overheat. (Alternatively place everything in a bowl and melt in the microwave on medium for about four minutes, stirring after two minutes.) While the chocolate is melting, mix the two flours, baking powder, sugars and cocoa in a big bowl, mixing together thoroughly or passing through a large sieve to evenly distribute the ingredients. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and stir in the natural yoghurt. Pour the melted chocolate mixture and the egg mixture into the flour mixture, stirring just until everything is well blended and you have a smooth, quite runny consistency. Do not over-beat or over-handle. Pour this into the tin and tap the tin gently for an even surface and the removal of any air bubbles trapped in the mix. Bake for one-and-a-half hours then check the cake by inserting a skewer in the centre. It should come out clean and the top should feel firm (don't worry if it cracks a little). Leave to cool in the tin (don't worry if it dips slightly), then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. When the cake is cold, cut it horizontally into three. To make the ganache: Chop the chocolate into small pieces and place into a bowl. Place the cream into a pan, add the sugar, heat until it is about to boil, then remove from the heat. Pour the cream over the chocolate and stir until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth. Add the raspberries, breaking them up a little before leaving it to cool slightly. Sandwich the layers together with just a little of the ganache. Pour the rest over the cake, letting it fall down the sides and smoothing to cover with a palette knife. Decorate with grated chocolate. (The cake keeps moist and gooey for three to four days). Top tip Whenever melting chocolate, always take care not to overheat as this can damage your recipe. Remember, chocolate melts in your mouth, so any hotter than body temperature is pointless. Chestnut &amp; chocolate cake by Arthur Potts-Dawson Ingredients 220ml milk 140g butter 3 medium eggs 150g chopped peeled chestnuts 70g chocolate 70% 220g plain flour 265g soft brown sugar 1 tbsp golden syrup 2 level tsp baking powder 1 vanilla pod, chopped finely \u00bd level tsp bicarbonate of soda pinch of salt Preheat oven to 190\u00b0C/gas 5. Sift together all the dry ingredients. Place the chocolate and milk into a bowl over warm water and allow to melt. Mix the butter and sugar together until creamy. Beat the eggs and slowly pour in to the creamed butter and sugar, add 20g of the flour. Stir in the golden syrup and chopped chestnuts and vanilla, mixing well. Fold in the remaining flour. Gradually add the chocolate mixture to form a thick batter. Pour into a buttered, floured 10-inch cake tin. Bake for one hour. Turn out on to a cake rack. Grate some more plain chocolate over the top of the warm cake - this will melt and create a lovely topping. Allow to cool, then serve with creme fraiche and a light dusting of cocoa powder. Chocolate amaretti cake by Linda Collister Ingredients 100g dark chocolate 100g amaretti biscuits (crunchy not soft) 100g plain flour 225g unsalted soft butter 175g caster sugar 5 large eggs 1 tablespoon amaretto liqueur or lukewarm water cocoa powder for dusting 23cm springclip tin, greased and lined Heat oven 180\u00b0C/gas 4. Break up the chocolate and put into the bowl of a food processor. Run the machine to make a fine powder. Add the amaretti biscuits and run the machine again until the mixture is fine. Add the flour then run the machine or pulse briefly just to combine the ingredients. Set aside until needed. Put the soft butter and sugar into the bowl of a food mixer and beat with the whisk attachment until light and creamy. Beat in the yolks, one at a time, beating after each addition. Stir in the chocolate mixture and the amaretto or warm water. In another bowl, whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Using a large metal spoon, fold the whites into the chocolate mixture in three batches. When thoroughly combined spoon the mixture into the prepared tin. Bake in the heated oven for about 40 minutes or until firm to the touch. Remove the tin from the oven and run a round-bladed knife around the inside of the tin to loosen the cake. Carefully unclip the tin and leave the cake to cool on a wire rack. Dust with cocoa powder just before serving with whipped cream. Store in an airtight container and eat within four days. Chilli-chocolate orange cake by Sam Stern Putting this cake together has been a labour of love. It's been through a load of variations and I think this one is pretty much perfect. Customise the cake to suit you \u2013 add more chilli if you like more heat. Go for the fudge icing for a sweeter tooth or the bitter chocolate for a sophisticated taste and finish. Ingredients 150g plain chocolate \u00bd tsp coffee granules 1tsp chilli flakes (or more if you like), crushed with pestle &amp; mortar or bashed with a rolling pin 125g butter 125g caster sugar 5 eggs, separated 75g self raising flour 1 pinch bicarbonate of soda 1\u00bdtsp baking powder 2tbsp cocoa powder 1tbsp rum or orange juice or water 1tsp vanilla essence 1tbs water Peel of half a medium orange, finely grated Glaze: 2 tablespoons of good orange marmalade Fudge icing: 300g icing sugar 25g divine cocoa powder 125g butter 4tbsp of water Bitter chocolate icing: 180g dark chocolate 125g unsalted butter 1tbsp golden syrup Preheat the oven to 160\u00b0C/gas 3. Line and grease a 20-22cm tin (springform or loose-based). Melt the chocolate by placing the pieces in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, not allowing the bowl to touch the water. Add the coffee granules and chilli. Let the mix melt then stir with a wooden spoon. Remove bowl and leave to cool. Cream the softened butter with the caster sugar in a food mixer or the proper way, with a wooden spoon, until light and white. Gently stir in the cooled chocolate and four egg yolks. Sift the flour, baking powder and cocoa powder into the bowl and then add the grated orange rind. Fold the mix gently together with a metal spoon using big scooping movements. Add the rum, vanilla and water. Whisk 5 egg whites until stiff (don't overwhisk). Add to the mixture by beating in the first tablespoon to loosen the consistency. Then fold the rest in very gently using a metal spoon. Don't worry if it's not perfect, as it can be hard to combine the two. Pour the mix into the tin and put it in the oven for 45-50 minutes (check after 35 \u2013 ovens vary!). To test it, prick with a cocktail stick. It should come out clean. Don't worry if the top of the cake has cracked a bit \u2013 you'll be icing it up. Remove and place on a cooling rack. Take out of the tin after five minutes and leave to cool. Brush the glaze on while still a bit warm. To make the glaze, put the marmalade into a saucepan and melt over a low heat until it's runny. Brush this onto the cooling cake base with a pastry brush. To make the fudge icing: combine the sifted icing sugar and cocoa powder in a bowl. Melt the butter and water and pour into the icing sugar mix. Beat until combined. It should be easily spreadable but not runny, so you might not need all the liquid. Cover the top of the cake and sides generously with the icing, tip it then finish using a spatula. Go for a smooth or a rough finish. You can decorate with cherries, grated chocolate, crumbled flake or chocolate curls (peel from a bar of chocolate with a potato peeler). For the bitter chocolate icing: melt chocolate pieces in a bain marie (as above) with butter and golden syrup. Pour it over the cake for a smooth finish. Let it set. Pipe messages on top or decorate with cherries.
