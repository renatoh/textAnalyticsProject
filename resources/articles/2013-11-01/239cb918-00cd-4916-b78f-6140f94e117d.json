The disgraced seven-times Tour de France winner was warned by Cookson, however, that his life ban is unlikely to be reduced. \"What I am really interested in, I have to say, is the allegations he has apparently made ... about the way in which he was given special treatment by the UCI,\" Cookson said. \"If that was true, I'd like to know about it.\" Armstrong made donations to the UCI totalling $125,000 (\u00a378,000) between 2002 and 2005. The allegations \u2013 strongly denied by the UCI \u2013 that Armstrong claimed he had influence within the governing body, were made by his former team-mates Floyd Landis and Tyler Hamilton. The head of the US Anti-Doping Agency, Travis Tygart, said last spring that \"Armstrong led us to believe \u2013 during the course of our interaction with him \u2013 that he had evidence of [the UCI's] complicity in this situation\". Armstrong stated, though, when interviewed by Oprah Winfrey this January that his donations were \"not in exchange for help\". Armstrong, 42, has claimed that he was unfairly singled out for investigation and that his sanction is a \"death sentence\" whereas others were more leniently treated, but Cookson joined the chorus of international sports figures who have played down the chances of that ban being reduced. \"He has admitted to cheating to win seven Tours de France,\" Cookson said. \"Whether other people cheated or not is perhaps irrelevant. I can't see him getting the same sanctions [as] people who have previously given evidence.\" After the World Anti-Doping Agency head, John Fahey, said on Tuesday that it would take \"a miracle\" for Armstrong to get his ban reduced, the International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, expressed similar views on Wednesday. \"I would not feel comfortable with this [reducing Armstrong's ban] because it is too little, too late. It was not even a real admission,\" Bach said after addressing delegates at the Wada conference. He added: \"Trying to bargain a deal there after everything has been proven, and now that he realises he doesn't just get off the hook \u2013 this is not the best way, to lessen a sanction or to be lenient there in any way.\" Cookson's comments came after a private meeting with Fahey at the World Conference on Doping in Sport in South Africa, at which the pair began to work out the details of the commission of inquiry. \"We've agreed that we will co-operate,\" Cookson said. \"We will have a commission of inquiry which the UCI will manage and run. We will agree on the detailed terms and conditions of that over the next few days, hopefully.\" Although any reduction in Armstrong's ban would have to come through the US Anti-Doping Agency rather than the UCI, Cookson conceded that there would have to be some trade-off for those who contribute to the inquiry. \"Some people will come forward and give evidence because they simply want to get it off their chest,\" he said. \"Others will not want to do that. So, there has to be some form of incentive and that is one of the things we are working on in the detail with Wada.\" The commission will be set up before the end of the year and should start work in early 2014. Cookson wants the investigation to be completed within a year but he said he was \"not putting that down as a firm deadline\". Details to be worked out include the appointment of commission members and deciding the exact remit. It appears that the Briton's election as UCI president has ended the long history of discord between Wada and the UCI \u2013 \"We had some very rocky moments in the past, but I'll leave the past,\" said Fahey, adding that there is \"a great deal of goodwill\" between the two bodies. Bridges have clearly been rebuilt with the Usada as well, as it will also be \"an important partner\" in the inquiry, Cookson added. Additionally, moves have been made towards getting more involvement from the French anti-doping agency, AFLD, to co-operate on drug testing during the Tour de France, with the eventual goal of making anti-doping processes independent of the UCI."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
