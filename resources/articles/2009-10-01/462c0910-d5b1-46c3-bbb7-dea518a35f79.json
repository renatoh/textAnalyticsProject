Suzy Gale, who this year will have worked for her husband, the Conservative MP for North Thanet, Roger Gale, for 27 years, said: \"I have taken advice from an employment lawyer and if this goes ahead I will be taking legal action for unfair dismissal or positive discrimination against whatever authority I can.\" Gale is one of about 200 employees who are related to sitting MPs but who stand to lose their jobs if Kelly, chairman of the committee on standards in public life, acts according to early leaks of his recommendations and bans MPs employing relatives as parliamentary secretaries and office managers at taxpayer expense. Cabinet ministers Hilary Benn and Bob Ainsworth employ their spouses in their offices, as does former foreign secretary Margaret Beckett. Peter and Iris Robinson, DUP politicians, have four members of their family on the payroll. Another MP's wife, also his office manager \u2013 who would only speak on condition of anonymity \u2013 suggested that barring MPs from employing their wives would lead to greater separation between MPs and their spouses \u2013 and what they called \"more divorces\", or to the couple maintaining a professional proximity but those spouses who were unpaid acting as \"vicars' wives\". She said: \"MPs are MPs, not office managers, and one of the most important things is that they have staff who provide continuity and loyalty, not staff who work for them for two months before going on somewhere else with contacts and insider knowledge. That's why spouses are the best employees. If you upset that balance then this decision will make a very lonely job more lonely, and is going to lead to a lot more divorces.\" On Thursday of next week, the day after Kelly has announced the new rules, relatives likely to lose their jobs will attend a meeting held by the Unite union to consider the impact of the changes. Though Gale is planning to make her own legal representations and stand on her own, Unite has said it is ready to represent MPs' relatives who work as staff in the Commons, and use employment law to stop Kelly sacking relatives of MPs who are on their staff. Dan Whittle, the Unite branch chairman, said: \"Whether it is unfair dismissal or discrimination law, we will offer our members whatever protection we can. Family members of MPs' staff save the taxpayer money by working many hours in unpaid overtime. The majority of the public want employment of family members to be transparent and regulated \u2013 not banned.\" However, Gale said advice she had received suggested it was not clear against whom she should launch legal challenges. \"Who do I sue for unfair dismissal? My husband or the House of Commons? Do I divorce my husband in order to continue working for him?\" Many MPs and the relatives that face losing their jobs argue their responsibilities stretch beyond the normal call of duty. Sara Linton, wife of the Labour MP for Battersea, Martin Linton, said though she was paid a part-time salary she frequently worked five days a week. Gale said she regularly worked a 60-hour week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
