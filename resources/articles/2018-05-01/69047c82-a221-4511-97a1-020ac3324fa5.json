Patients are also losing out because a long-promised revolution in how NHS care is delivered to help them stay healthy at home and avoid unnecessary stays in hospital has not happened. The warning, by the main organisation representing NHS trusts in England, also casts grave doubt on the progress of the Five Year Forward View, the government\u2019s plan for improving the NHS. Community services trusts, which specialise in providing out-of-hospital care, have been left \u201coverstretched, underfunded and understaffed\u201d because promises to expand their key role have not led to concrete action, claims NHS Providers. Financial problems and serious understaffing mean they are struggling to cope with a surge in demand for their services linked to the ageing population and growth in long-term health conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Declining numbers of district nurses and health visitors have coincided with more patients seeking care from community trusts. \u201cAll too often NHS community services are marginalised, underfunded and short-staffed. It is patients who are paying the price for the failure to follow through on past commitments as hospitals struggle to keep up with rising demand for treatment\u201d, said Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents community and acute hospital trusts. Governments and the NHS have been promising to boost out-of-hospital care since at least a 2003 report by Derek Wanless, commissioned by the Labour government. But the new report says 15 years on, provision remains worryingly inadequate. A survey of 51 bosses of NHS community trusts included in it found that more than nine out of 10 feel the work their organisations do is not valued by NHS leaders nationally. Four out of five (82%) fear community services will not get the money they need to deliver the transformation in healthcare envisaged by the Five Year Forward View. In addition: Half (52%) said funding in their area had fallen in the last year. 44% have been cutting costs. Almost a third (30%) have shed staff. Hopson added that the failure to build up community services matters because \u201cit affects people who have to wait longer \u2013 often lonely, anxious and in pain \u2013 for the care they need at home. It causes delays for patients who could be discharged from hospitals if the right treatment or rehabilitation were available\u201d. \u201cIt can impact on our ability to stay well, avoiding sickness and the need for treatment. And it can make the difference over whether we are able to die in the manner and place of our choosing.\u201d Dr Nick Scriven, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine which represents hospital doctors, said: \u201cThe only thing preventing the total meltdown of our acute hospital services is community care in its broadest sense. \u201cAlmost all the plans for how the NHS as a whole is meant to cope with demand both in short and longer terms as in the five year plan, are predisposed on increased care closer to home for patients, both preventing admissions to hospital and also providing timely care after the acute illness has passed. \u201cThis report gives a much needed but frankly distressing wake-up call to all those who currently write the policies and tell us year on year things will be better, mainly because of better (ie more costly) community care projects.\u201d Labour MP Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: \u201cEight years of austerity is seriously damaging the community health services we all rely on. At the very time when we should be investing more in community health provision, services are being restricted and vital staff like heath visitors and district nurses are falling. The next Labour government will expand, and invest in, community health services as the key to the long-term strength of the NHS.\u201d A spokesman for NHS England said: \u201cThis report highlights the inescapable pressure on GPs, hospitals and community services from a growing, ageing and sicker population, which will have to be properly factored in to NHS funding decisions for the decade ahead.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
