The ruling was made last night by the financial services and markets tribunal and is a major embarrassment for the Financial Services Authority, which had fined Mr Davidson \u00a3750,000. The fine was not paid pending the outcome of the tribunal. In a unanimous decision, the tribunal said that \"on the evidence before us, the authority has not discharged the burden of proving to us, to the requisite degree of probability, that Mr Davidson either created, or took part in, the scheme or arrangement to facilitate the flotation of Cyprotex.\" Ashley Tatham, the City Index trader who handled the bet, was also cleared of any wrongdoing. The tribunal said \"all he did was to effect a spread bet in the normal course of his business\". The tribunal added that neither applicant sought to conceal any of their actions. In a damming indictment of the FSA, the tribunal said that even if they had been found guilty of market abuse it would not have imposed a penalty. The tribunal said: \"The applicants took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence to avoid behaving in a way which amounted to market abuse or requiring or encouraging another to engage in market abuse.\" The case had centred on complex spread bets and contracts for difference at the time of the Cyprotex flotation but the tribunal ruled there was \"no regulatory obligation to disclose the spread bet of the contracts for differences in the prospectus and so any failure to disclose was not market abuse.\" Mr Davidson, who left school at 15 with no qualifications, built up a multi-million pound business empire and enjoyed all the usual trappings of success. He had a fleet of Ferraris, Bentleys, a yacht and a country mansion in Cheshire's stockbroker belt. During his lengthy battle with the City regulator, he was declared bankrupt with debts said to total \u00a320m. He was also described in the high court as an \"alcoholdependent depressive\". It was the second time the tribunal had considered Mr Davidson's case. The first case was abandoned last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
