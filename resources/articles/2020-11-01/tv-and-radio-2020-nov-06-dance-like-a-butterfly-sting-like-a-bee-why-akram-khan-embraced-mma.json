Yet, for a new Channel 4 documentary, he decided to delve into something darker that has followed him throughout his life: violence. \u201cTo experience life, sometimes you have to be very close to the threshold of death,\u201d he says on a video call from his home. \u201cFrom the safety of our room, we can feel that excitement through watching another person go through this danger.\u201d A fascination with this voyeuristic inclination led Khan into the world of MMA \u2013 mixed martial arts fighting \u2013 and \u201chow the violence in trained fighters compared to the violence as a dancer\u201d. Notorious for its bloody, no-holds-barred bouts inside an octagonal cage, MMA has fast risen in popularity and profitability in recent years, finding controversial stars in the likes of the Irish fighter Conor McGregor and the Russian Khabib Nurmagomedov. Intrigued to find out why the visceral, brutal sport has such a pull for audiences and fighters alike, Khan found himself in a training gym last year following three of Britain\u2019s top MMA hopefuls: Terry \u201cthe Dominator\u201d Brazier, Michael \u201cVenom\u201d Page (MVP) and Mike \u201cSea Bass\u201d Shipman. It was here that he donned a flimsy foam outfit and subjected himself to the force of Brazier\u2019s incisive blows. \u201cFor a dancer, the only opponent is you: you\u2019re fighting with yourself to just make it to the end of the performance, whereas in the cage they are trained to take down their opponent,\u201d Khan says. \u201cBoth modes of violence tell a story and entertain to a degree, but the intention is different. Anything that takes you to the edge, whether it\u2019s emotional or physical, is a form of violence.\u201d Over the course of the hour-long documentary, we witness Khan\u2019s conversion from a fairly timid sceptic of MMA to an enthusiastic convert, shouting and rooting for the three fighters in their live bouts at Wembley Arena, as well as choreographing a routine for Brazier as he walks into the cage. \u201cThe fighters surprised me, because they were so philosophical about what they do,\u201d Khan says. \u201cFor Mike, he was referencing Carl Jung and talking about the need to express the violence within us in a controlled way. For MVP, it was all about entertainment and emulating his childhood heroes like Bruce Lee. Terry came from a very violent childhood and then enlisted to fight in Afghanistan and experienced his own traumas there, so MMA is a way for him to focus and channel his frustrations. Their violence is extremely disciplined, not fuelled by rage.\u201d Khan\u2019s exposure to the more frenzied form of violence began young. He grew up working at his father\u2019s Indian restaurant in Wimbledon in the 80s and racism was never far from their door. \u201cWhen I was a teenager, I got really caught up in alpha-male violence,\u201d he says. \u201cI formed a group with other people of colour in my area and we were fighting the racists, these white supremacist guys who were quite prevalent there at the time. But there was one moment in a fight when my friend actually harmed somebody and, after seeing that, I realised that this is not me.\u201d Instead, Khan was drawn to what he describes as the \u201cempathy of dance\u201d, an emotional identification with your body and with the bodies of others as you move. \u201cWe\u2019ve become detached from our bodies and that\u2019s why empathy is missing from the world,\u201d he says. \u201cDance talks about the human condition in a way that doesn\u2019t use words, which can easily be skewed and politicised. It simply communicates.\u201d Once Khan realised that the spectacle surrounding MMA was just as important as the fight itself, he set about creating a dance-based narrative for Brazier\u2019s walk-on to the cage, merging the controlled violence of both practices. \u201cI was really out of my comfort zone,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to brace myself, since I was creating a work to reach an audience that is not my usual one and I didn\u2019t know how they were going to take it. And when we came to the performance, half were already drunk and some were even breaking out into fights among themselves.\u201d The resulting dance sees a group of black-clad male dancers crowding a shirtless Brazier, braying ahead of him like a pack of wild animals, manifesting the energy of his violent potential as he marches forward to his opponent. \u201cThe dance became part of the show and the audience was really open about it,\u201d Khan says. \u201cThe people I spoke to afterwards kept saying that it was something really different. It was an experiment in how movement in different environments change the way that you feel.\u201d In the year since those fights, Khan has kept a watchful eye on his three hopefuls and has taken up Brazilian jujitsu after being inspired by watching the fighters train in the practice. Has he reconciled his relationship to this violence in the process? \u201cWhen I\u2019m entering a dance performance, I feel like a warrior monk \u2013 there\u2019s something sacred and peaceful about it,\u201d he says. \u201cThis experience was the exact opposite. It was a chance for me to feel alive in a different way.\u201d The intervening year has also seen the coronavirus pandemic bring an abrupt end to Khan\u2019s usually rigorous performance schedule, a stop to the movement he considers vital to fostering empathy with others. \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling, but I just have to change the way I think,\u201d he says. \u201cI have to see this as a moment to pause, to reflect on the damage we have done to nature and to each other. Perhaps then we can learn something from this time. We\u2019re craving the oldest ritual of our species, which is to gather around and share stories through music, dance and theatre. If we lose that, then we lose what it means to be human.\u201d Extreme Combat: The Dancer and the Fighter is on Channel 4 on 8 November at 10pm"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
