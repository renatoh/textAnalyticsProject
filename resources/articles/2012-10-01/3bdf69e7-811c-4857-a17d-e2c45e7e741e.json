Champagne is back \u2013 unlike last year, when displays of opulence were frowned upon. But then the conference in Birmingham does seem to be one of the few places in the UK unravaged by austerity. At the market stall inside the secure conference perimeter you can shop at Harvey Nicks: \u00a350 for a bottle of own-label port, \u00a31,275 for a black cashmere ladies' shawl-wrap coat, \u00a3995 for a cashmere men's coat, and (a best-selling line) a men's camel-coloured wool coat for \u00a3895. As an accompaniment there's craft jewellery on sale nearby, including an ocean-liner brooch made of Australian boulder opal stone, encrusted with diamonds and three 18-carat gold funnels. A snip at \u00a35,800. Just bring some ID to prove you're not claiming benefits. \u2022 The Jimmy Savile controversy rumbles on, meanwhile, with more fingers pointing at the BBC and the corporation's haters celebrating Christmas come early. Good, then, to have Gillian Reynolds, the venerable Daily Telegraph radio reviewer, as the voice of composure and sanity. This is awful, but probably best to let sleeping dogs lie, she says, adding: \"I knew one of his Radio 1 producers, now dead, who was appalled by his behaviour and said so at the time. I can think of several living former BBC executives who so far seem to have avoided all invitations to comment. I'd like to know who nominated Savile for his knighthood.\" This is known as putting out the fire with petrol. \u2022 Yes, there are so many questions. Mostly of the \"what-did-they-know-and-when-did-they-know-it\" variety. David Cameron, for one, wants answers. Here's a question worth pondering. To what extent was Savile checked out when the Tory government appointed him to head a taskforce in 1988 examining conditions and governance at Broadmoor? And who did the checking before ministers bestowed on him this prestigious, responsible position? Was it Gary Glitter? \u2022 So often, there is a backstory. And certainly history played a part in Monday's events when the conservative columnist Peter Oborne was interviewed on the BBC's Daily Politics. Andrew Neil had just interviewed former Tory social security secretary Norman Fowler about the chancellor's policies. Oborne called Fowler \"useless\", saying he had the most pusillanimous policies of any one-time Tory minister, obliging Neil to give a shocked Fowler a right of reply. I've never paid much attention to Oborne, the grandee said. What's this about, probed Neil. \"It's personal,\" said Oborne, refusing to elaborate. Trivial, when set against the issues of the day. But it does seem a shame to let it rest. \u2022 Finally, to comedian Mike Sheer, who is trying to tapdance his way out of a mess he created for himself and the UK's leading comedy website, Chortle, with a piece titled Women or Rape, Which is Less Funny? From peers and beyond, there is widespread condemnation. This is why. \"We just can't seem to put our finger on whether or not rape and women are funny! But can we ascertain which is less funny,\" asks Mike. \"Rape is essentially raw brutality. OK, so far so funny. Anything violent has the capacity to be hilarious. I believe it's called 'slapstick'. However, rape is also a devastatingly personal tragedy and loss. That's not funny \u2013 to those of us who can empathise and probably the victim. As to whether or not the rapist finds it funny is inconsequential. They've already had their fun.\" Many, said Mike, \"find it abhorrent that rape would be something to be censored in comedy \u2013 and quite right.\" After much skitting, he concluded: \"Women are less funny than rape.\" There was uproar, so Mike set out to explain himself. \"Frequent visitors to sites like this are constantly bombarded with various articles debating whether or not women are funny. Like many others, I'm bored and disgusted by the legitimacy this gives the question,\" he said. \"Asking if women are funny is a hangover from our male-centric history, and echoes a primitive attitude that still pops up in communities deeply ingrained with social flaws.\" So there has been misinterpretation. The whole thing was parody. He'll have to do better than that, one suspects. Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
