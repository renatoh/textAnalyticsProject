Coloradans will vote on a constitutional amendment to allow residents of three Colorado communities a vote to extend casino hours, and citizens of Washington state must decide on permitting lethal prescriptions for terminally ill adults and, separately, on an initiative requiring the synchronisation of traffic lights. Add to that the elections to state-wide and community offices, and you will appreciate how busy the average US citizen will be on the first Tuesday in November. Of course it couldn't happen in Scotland. Both a report on the 2007 election and the Scottish parliament have concluded that we cannot cope with the responsibility of electing our MSPs and councillors on the same day. But if we take seriously a recommendation from Reform Scotland's latest publication, 'Power to Protect', we could soon find ourselves emulating our American cousins in one respect \u2013 electing the area procurator fiscal. The report's authors nurse a naive hope that such elections wouldn't be fought on a party political basis, but it would only be a matter of time before the competing legal professionals used their favoured party organisation to help get out their vote. And surely at a time when serious thought should be given to making the prosecution role of Lord Advocate less political, it's a bit wacky to politicise the role of the fiscal. But as with all such reports, it's important not to throw the baby out with the bath water. Another of the report's recommendations may find increasing support, namely that no one should be sent to jail in the first instance for a sentence of less than three months. The arguments are well made, not least the fact that little or nothing can be achieved in such a short time to promote rehabilitation. Rather, the convicted person too often matriculates in the college of crime at some considerable expense to the taxpayer. This proposal follows fast on the recommendation from the Scottish Prisons Commission that the government should bring forward legislation to require a sentencing judge, who would otherwise have imposed a sentence of six months imprisonment or less, to impose a community supervision sentence instead. These ideas merit serious consideration \u2013 provided sheriffs don't substitute a six-month term with one for seven months. The significance of these radical proposals is that they are made against a backdrop of a very real overcrowding problem in our prisons. Scotland's prison population reached 8,137 last month, exceeding, by some margin, the spaces realistically available. So when the chief executive of the Scottish Prison Service, Mike Ewart, tells a national newspaper that he has to 'speak out' because he believes numbers have reached a level, which is 'unsafe operationally and legally', we must surely sit up and take note? We are also entitled to assume that Mr Ewart has advised his ministers of the immediacy of such a critical situation, but if ministers have a contingency plan, Kenny MacAskill's deputy, Fergus Ewing, was being remarkably coy about it when he appeared before the parliament's Justice Committee last Tuesday. As Justice Minister, in 2002, I appeared before the Justice Committee and tried to make the case for three new private prisons. I made little headway not only because of philosophical opposition to private prisons, but also because committee members \u2013 and particularly Mr MacAskill's colleagues \u2013 didn't believe the projections, ranging up to 8,500 prisoners. I argued that a consequence of not facing up to these projections could be that one day we would 'have to let people out because there was no room for them'. I must confess to having some empathy with Mr MacAskill. The prisons must accept all whom the independent judiciary send. And he has also advocated a much greater use of options to imprisonment using community based sentences. In fact, in 2006-07 there were 40 per cent more community sentences than in the first year of devolution. Yet the prison population continued to rise. That should not dampen Mr MacAskill's enthusiasm for putting more emphasis and resource into non-custodial sentences, but it may be some time before it has an impact on numbers. In response to the committee's questions about the possible crisis, Fergus Ewing pointed to the three new prisons to which this government is committed. Addiewell in West Lothian should receive its first prisoners at the turn of the year, but the other two, at Bishopbriggs and Grampian, are either at the tendering or planning stage. This is not a seventh cavalry just about to appear from over the hill. The real crunch will come if there is an incident such as a fire in one of the prisons. At that stage, the Justice Secretary has a simple choice: let some out or find alternative accommodation in which to lock them all up. You can't put them in tents on a playing field. Before the committee, Fergus Ewing seemed to dismiss Annabel Goldie's suggestion of converted old hospitals or military barracks so that narrows the option. In 2002, parliament was not persuaded of the case for three new prisons, and so modified proposals had to be brought forward. Should Mr MacAskill have to come before this parliament with difficult proposals for early release, he will be hoping there is a collective parliamentary responsibility, handed down from the past, to support him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
