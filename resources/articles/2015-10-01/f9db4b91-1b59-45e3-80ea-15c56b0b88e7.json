Because of the nature of the work, because they can play off each other, interact and be different. Jackie \u201cStevie\u201d Stevenson and John River of River (BBC1) are certainly different. She\u2019s young, fun and worldly, likes holidays and singing along to 70s disco classics in the car (love that Tina Charles scene, both of them and his lonely karaoke moment later). He\u2019s a bookish Beatles man and a workaholic, troubled and world-weary. And Swedish! Hey, that\u2019s one way of getting a bit of Scandinavian noir into something: getting an actual lugubrious Scandinavian \u2013 the lovely Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd \u2013 and plonking him right in the centre, the title character. \u201cStevie\u201d is played by Nicola Walker. Also lovely, but confusing as she\u2019s also a cop in Unforgotten, which just started on ITV. And I was already muddling that with From Darkness (unearthing of bones and running from the past with Anne-Marie Duff) on BBC1. There\u2019s so much TV police work kicking off at the moment that I need to put up some of those boards detectives stick stuff to in my living room to keep the cases separate in my head. Anyway, River and Stevie have a nice relationship. She annoys the crap out of him and teases him mercilessly. There\u2019s clearly a lot of proper affection between them as well. It\u2019s a slightly odd working relationship, though; when River spots a Ford Mondeo they\u2019ve been looking for, follows the driver into a shop then chases him (to the man\u2019s accidental death, it turns out), she doesn\u2019t really get involved or help very much. And then it becomes clear why: she\u2019s dead. Oh. One of those kinds of partners \u2013 the dead kind. She was killed on duty; he was there, this Mondeo may have been involved. No wonder River is so miserable. Well, that\u2019s his default disposition \u2013 he\u2019s a TV cop after all. But, on top of that, his partner, his friend, a woman he probably loved (though he\u2019s unlikely to admit that to anyone, least of all himself) died next to him. To the grumpiness add grief and guilt. Stevie\u2019s not the only person haunting him (ghosts, or whatever \u2013 he calls them \u201cmanifests\u201d). Mondeo man (who may have been involved in Stevie\u2019s murder or may just be a drug dealer) turns up at a press conference. A tragic girl \u2013 a modern-day Juliet Capulet \u2013 whose disappearance River is working on, turns up around the copper\u2019s flat. \u201cHow do you let go of a person if you don\u2019t know why they\u2019ve gone?\u201d the girl\u2019s mother asks River. This, you suspect, is the key to why these people aren\u2019t properly leaving when they die. River the miserable Swede sees dead people then. Kinda Wallander meets Sixth Sense. I\u2019m putting that on my board. I\u2019ve also got a picture of Thomas Neill Cream on there. Yes, the Lambeth Poisoner, another of River\u2019s manifests. Why is he back, though, when everyone knows why he went? He was hanged for being a serial killer in the olden days. My River board is getting more intriguing and distinct from my From Darkness board and my Unforgiven one. It\u2019s more than just crime drama \u2013 it\u2019s about personal tragedy, demons; it\u2019s a study of loss and grief (which it shares with the greatest Nordic noir of them all: the first series of The Killing). It\u2019s also a study of that \u2013 killing \u2013 and why people do it. And why they did it \u2013 Mr Cream brings a historical perspective to it. And Abi Morgan, the creator of the series, brings a characteristic humanness to it all; it\u2019s as much about who the people are as about what they do to each other. Good enough for me. There are plenty of great things in Girls to Men (Channel 4). Alfie, Ethan and Billy (formerly Ana, Lauren and Connie) talk frankly and often movingly about being born in the wrong body. I\u2019m just struggling a bit with some of the practicalities. Such as Billy starting the final part of his transformation. The surgeon draws a penis plan, like a sewing pattern, on Billy\u2019s stomach, then slices away. Billy\u2019s new penis is rolled and sewn up and stuffed; testicles with valves and pumps will be added to make it operate. It\u2019s amazing and brilliant, but I\u2019m watching and wincing through my fingers with my legs crossed. Obviously I\u2019m an old-fashioned prude, but I\u2019m not sure I want down-there surgery in 48-inch high definition."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
