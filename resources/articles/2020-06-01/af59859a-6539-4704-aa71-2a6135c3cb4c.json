I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest for the next few hours \u2013 please do get in touch with any news, tips, comments or questions of your own. Twitter: @helenrsullivan Email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com It\u2019s time for me to hand over to my colleague Helen Sullivan in Sydney. Thanks for following along and writing in. I\u2019ll leave you with a round-up of recent key developments: The coronavirus death toll has passed the grim milestone of half a million deaths. The number of people who have died in the outbreak stands at 500,321, according to John Hopkins University tracker. It\u2019s important to note the actual number of deaths is likely to be significantly higher than the tally compiled from government figures. US health secretary Alex Azar has warned that \u201cthe window is closing\u201d on the country\u2019s chance to take action to effectively curb the coronavirus, as the number of confirmed cases surpassed 2.5m. The mayor of Leicester has argued more coronavirus testing data is needed before deciding whether to implement a local lockdown in the UK city. Brazil has recorded 30,476 new cases of the coronavirus in the past 24 hours and 552 additional deaths, the health ministry said on Sunday. Sudan is extending a lockdown in the state of Khartoum aimed at curbing the spread of the new coronavirus by one week until 7 July, the government spokesman said on Sunday. The United Arab Emirates will not receive passengers coming from Pakistan as of 29 June until a special Covid-19 lab is set up to test them, the civil aviation authority has said. Brazil recorded 30,476 new cases of the coronavirus in the past 24 hours and 552 additional deaths, the health ministry said on Sunday. The country has now registered a total of 1,344,143 confirmed cases and 57,622 deaths. The mayor of Leicester has argued more coronavirus testing data is needed before deciding whether to implement a local lockdown in the UK city. Peter Soulsby said the information was \u201ckey to determining what intervention is needed\u201d to respond to a recent spike in cases. This follows a report that Leicester could be subject to Britain\u2019s first local lockdown this week. The city\u2019s mayor said: \u201cMore testing and immediate access to the data is key to determining what intervention is needed. Whether that intervention is giving more advice or something more dramatic we don\u2019t yet know. \u201cIf it is decided that a local lockdown is needed the city council currently has no powers to implement this, and there would need to be extensive discussion around the area to be locked down, including whether this extends beyond the city boundaries.\u201d Soulsby and Leicester city council\u2019s director of public health are due to meet with government officials on Monday morning to discuss the latest data. The UK prime minister will attempt to kickstart the economy after Covid-19 with a decade-long schools rebuilding plan, PA Media reports. Boris Johnson is expected to announce the spending plans on Tuesday as he lays the groundwork for the UK to spend its way out of the coronavirus downturn by undertaking a vast building programme. Part of the plans will include a 10-year undertaking to improve school facilities, along with sprucing up classrooms currently in use. A \u00a31bn cash injection will see construction work start on the first 50 projects as soon as September 2021, Downing Street said. Another \u00a3560m will go towards school repairs in this financial year while further education colleges will see \u00a3200m of the \u00a31.5bn promised by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, at the spring budget to transform college estates over the next five years fast tracked so work can be brought forward. However, Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman Layla Moran called the announcement \u201cspin over substance\u201d, saying: \u201cThe funding is nowhere near the 7bn the National Audit Office has said is needed to repair our schools.\u201d The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said the PM would have to ensure the programme reversed a \u201clost decade\u201d of low investment in many regions. The coronavirus death toll has passed the grim milestone of half a million deaths. The number of people who have died in the outbreak stands at 500,108 according to John Hopkins University tracker. The actual number of deaths is likely to be significantly higher than the tally compiled from government figures. The US has the highest death toll at 125,747, followed by Brazil at 57,070. Some 43,634 people have died in the UK. Sudan is extending a lockdown in the state of Khartoum aimed at curbing the spread of the new coronavirus by one week until 7 July, the government spokesman said on Sunday. From 8 July there will be a gradual return to normal, though a night curfew will be imposed from 6 pm until 5 am, Faisal Salih told Reuters. Sudan has confirmed 9,258 cases of the coronavirus, including 572 deaths. Authorities have extended the closure of Khartoum\u2019s international airport until 12 July. In England, parents and school leaders have criticised the government\u2019s free school meals scheme for being hard to use, with many having difficulties buying food with the vouchers and others complaining about a helpline that costs \u00a321 an hour. While the government\u2019s U-turn over extending free school meals in England over the summer holiday has been widely welcomed after the intervention of Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford, many school leaders said their trust in the system has already collapsed. Read Mattha Busby\u2019s full report here. Here\u2019s a round-up of the key developments for those of you just joining us. The total number of people to test positive for Covid-19 worldwide has exceeded 10 million, according to Johns Hopkins University. It stands at 10,057,300, while the number of global deaths is at 499,967. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States has passed 2.5 million. More than 125,000 Americans have died of Covid-19, the highest known death toll from the disease in the world. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has said the state will consider potential stay-at-home orders and suburban lockdowns to contain several coronavirus clusters in Melbourne, after another 49 cases of coronavirus were detected on Saturday \u2013 the highest daily number since April. Mask-wearing will be mandatory in certain areas of Iran as of next week and virus-hit provinces can reimpose restrictive measures, president Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday. LGBT+ Brazilians are being disproportionately impacted by Covid-19 job losses, a survey has found. A report by advocacy group #VoteLGBT has found that one in four unemployed gay and trans Brazilians has lost their job recently during the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 almost double the nation\u2019s overall rate. Sri Lanka officially lifted its nationwide lockdown on Sunday, after a selective curfew was reimposed a month ago during a surge in coronavirus infections. The island nation imposed the lockdown on March 20 and lifted it gradually over the past two months, although a nighttime curfew remained in place. A quick reminder you can get in touch with me on Twitter @cleaskopeliti. The United Arab Emirates will not receive passengers coming from Pakistan as of 29 June until a special Covid-19 lab is set up to test them, the civil aviation authority has said. The decision also applies to transit flights originating from Pakistan, where the number of cases is rising rapidly, the General Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement carried on state media. Dubai state carrier Emirates had already said it was suspending flights from Pakistan effective 24 June. Polish president Andrzej Duda won the most votes in the first round of Poland\u2019s presidential election on Sunday, an exit poll found, and will face a run-off vote in two weeks\u2019 time against Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski. Duda, an ally of the ruling nationalists Law and Justice (PiS), got 41.8% of the vote, according to the exit poll, falling short of the 50% needed to claim victory in the first round. Trzaskowski, who is standing for the largest opposition party, the centrist Civic Platform (PO) got 30.4% of votes, the poll showed. US health secretary Alex Azar has warned that \u201cthe window is closing\u201d on the country\u2019s chance to take action to effectively curb the coronavirus, as the number of confirmed cases surpassed 2.5m. The Health and Human Services secretary pointed to a recent spike in infections, particularly in the south and said people have \u201cto act responsibly\u201d by social distancing and wearing face masks especially \u201cin these hot zones\u201d. For a third consecutive day on Saturday, the number of confirmed US cases rose by more than 40,000. In Arizona, cases have risen by 267% so far in June and jumped by a record 3,857 cases on Sunday, the eighth record-breaking increase this month. Overall, US deaths from Covid-19 have surpassed 125,000 with more than 2.5m confirmed cases, according to compiled by Johns Hopkins University, far more than any other country in the world. Bryan Armen Graham has more on the situation in the US here. French prime minister Edouard Philippe claimed victory in the race to become mayor of Le Havre in Sunday\u2019s municipal elections. He won with 58.8% of the vote, according to TF1/LCI TV. \u201cWe\u2019re happy in Le Havre, we will celebrate this victory,\u201d Philippe said. France\u2019s constitution allows Philippe to nominate a deputy to his mayoral seat while he remains prime minister, but his victory will raise questions over a possible government reshuffle. Philippe will meet with president Emmanuel Macron on Monday morning for a one-to-one meeting. The result comes in municipal elections where amid persistent fears of coronavirus contagion, just over a third of voters had turned out by 5pm, three hours before polling stations close, according to the interior ministry. AFP has the latest on Poland\u2019s presidential election, in which polls indicate that incumbent Andrzej Duda will fall short of a majority and there will need to be a run-off on 12 July. Turnout was at a record high by 5pm with almost 48% having voted compared to about 34% by the same time in the last presidential election in 2015, the national election commission said. \u201cThis is a decisive time. A lot will really depend on this decision,\u201d anti-communist icon Lech Walesa said as he cast his vote in the northern port of Gdansk wearing a transparent plastic visor over his face. Walesa, who was elected Poland\u2019s first democratic president after communism\u2019s demise three decades ago, has been a trenchant critic of the current government. Latin America has just 8% of the world\u2019s population but it currently accounts for 45% of daily deaths, according to Carlos del Rio, a Mexican-born infectious disease expert with Emory University. Given the very low levels of testing across the region, the most worrying aspect was not the number of confirmed cases but the levels of mortality, del Rio said. Reuters has this report on the situation in Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas. While only 100 deaths have been officially registered in the country of around 11 million, many believe the number is far higher. Berthony Clermont shares a two-room flat without running water with 10 relatives in the Haitian capital\u2019s Cite Soleil slum, so when he fell ill with the novel coronavirus, they all did. \u201cI tried staying at home at the beginning but it was difficult to isolate myself as the house is too small,\u201d said the 45-year old. Mistrustful of the dilapidated public healthcare in Haiti - the poorest country in the Americas - Clermont and his family treated themselves at home with herbal teas. Clermont\u2019s plight is shared by many in Haiti and, more broadly, across the Caribbean and Latin America. Home to 654 million people, it is the most unequal region in the world, according to the United Nations. As governments in Europe and some parts of Asia have managed to stem the spread of coronavirus, Latin America and the Caribbean have emerged as one of the epicenters of the pandemic. With confirmed cases globally hitting the 10 million mark on Sunday, the region accounts for around a quarter of those. From Argentina to Mexico, nearly one in five of Latin America\u2019s urban population lives in crowded slums, like Cite de Soleil. In such poor, densely-packed neighbourhoods - with little or no access to running water, sanitation and health facilities - residents struggle to follow even the basic hygiene guidelines that experts recommend to prevent contagion with the highly infectious virus. And, given a large informal labor sector and insufficient government welfare, many people cannot afford to quarantine - even when they are ill. Sauveur Desroches, 55, said that even after he started feeling sick with the virus, he kept working for four days at a construction site in Port au Prince. \u201cBut then my body just gave way and I had to stay in bed,\u201d said Desroches, receiving treatment at an emergency COVID-19 facility set up in Cite Soleil by medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF). Here\u2019s a round up of the key developments over the last few hours: A total of 10,039,286 coronavirus cases have been confirmed around the world, according to Johns Hopkins University tracker. The global death toll stands at 499,664. Police in The Hague, in the Netherlands, have detained 37 protesters who ignored a court ban and held a demonstration against social distancing rules on Sunday, they said. The UK\u2019s death toll from confirmed cases of Covid-19 has risen by 36 to 43,550, government figures showed on Sunday. For the first time in months, Madrid, Spain\u2019s hardest-hit region, has registered zero deaths from the coronavirus. In the US, the number of coronavirus cases in Florida rose by 8,530 to 141,075 on Sunday, according to the state health department. No new coronavirus deaths were recorded in Scotland for a third day in a row. Care home residents were more likely to die of Covid-19 in the UK than in any of the major European countries apart from Spain, analysis of global data has revealed. Tens of thousands of Covid-19 survivors in the UK should be screened for post-traumatic stress disorder because of their experiences in fighting for their lives, mental health experts have urged. The Greek island of Kos will host 170 German doctors for free from Monday, \u201cin recognition and gratitude for their contribution in combating the coronavirus in Germany,\u201d the Greek tourism ministry said on Sunday. Thousands of transgender people and their supporters donned masks to march through central London to Parliament Square on Saturday to celebrate the black transgender community, and protest against potential amendments to the Gender Recognition Act. UK prime minister Boris Johnson has promised to spend billions of pounds to rescue the economy as he warned the country faces the looming \u201cthunderclap of economic consequences\u201d of Covid-19. In the UK, more than 200 people have been caught wild camping in the Lake District, with 20 people fined for having a party on one of the fells and others lighting fires on summits. The party took place on Saturday night on Catbells, one of the most popular hills in the Lakes, which offers panoramic views over Keswick, Derwent Water and Borrowdale. It came after weeks of complaints from residents about rubbish left behind by visitors, including wheelie suitcases and tents abandoned on the fells. Officials from the Lake District national park, the National Trust, Forestry England and Cumbria county council and police spent Saturday night \u201ceducating\u201d those breaking lockdown rules, prohibiting overnight stays and fining those who refused to pack up and go home. North of England editor Helen Pidd has the full report here. Police in The Hague detained 37 protesters who ignored a court ban and held a demonstration against social distancing rules on Sunday, they said. Around 200 protesters took part in Sunday\u2019s demonstration, far fewer than a week ago when several thousand attended a similar protest. Organisers had called on people to stay home this week in view of Friday\u2019s court ruling that the protest violated restrictions on public gatherings. The protesters say a policy of requiring people to stand 1.5 metres (about four feet) apart is undemocratic and should be lifted. The Netherlands has recorded more than 50,000 Covid-19 infections and more than 6,000 deaths since mid-March. Restrictions are being lifted after a steep decline in new cases and deaths in recent weeks. French voters went to the polls in face masks on Sunday in the last round of municipal elections, with analysts predicting a shift away from president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s party on the local level. Amid persistent fears of coronavirus contagion, just over 15 % of voters had turned out by midday - fewer even than four hours into the first election round on 15 March marked by a record 55 % abstention rate. Polls opened for 12 hours for some 16.5 million eligible voters at 8:00 am in nearly 5,000 cities and towns, about 15% of the country\u2019s municipal councils, where the first election round did not yield a decisive outcome. Power remains up for grabs in the key cities of Paris, Lyon, Toulouse, and Strasbourg. The opening round was held just as the Covid-19 pandemic was gaining deadly momentum, but the second phase, scheduled for 22 March, was put off after France went into lockdown. A new date was set after the government\u2019s scientific council said it was possible to hold another round safely, but voters are required to wear face masks and were urged to bring their own pens. Many voters and election officials sported germ-blocking plastic visors, and plexiglass screens were erected between them at several polling stations, which also provided sanitising hand gel. Meanwhile, in UK football news: Andre Gray is one of three players to be left out of the Watford squad for the team\u2019s vital match against Southampton on Sunday after the striker reportedly hosted a party in contravention of government lockdown rules. Domingos Quina and Nathaniel Chalobah were the other two players reported to be in attendance. A news item on Watford\u2019s official website says that all three \u201chave all been omitted from the squad by Nigel Pearson to ensure the health and safety of all players, staff and officials at today\u2019s game\u201d.

As UK mental health experts urge post-traumatic stress disorder screening for Covid-19 survivors, do read this report by my colleague Jessica Murray. \u201cYou are so busy concentrating on trying to get your next breath, you\u2019re not even aware that you\u2019re in shock,\u201d the 59-year-old mother of two said. \u201cIt has a really profound effect on you if you\u2019re aware of your circumstances. I must have seen at least eight people die. \u201cAnd the fear in people\u2019s eyes is shocking. Everyone \u2013 consultants, nurses, anyone who was allowed in there \u2013 you could see how frightened they were.\u201d Hello, I\u2019m Clea Skopeliti and I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest for the next few hours. You can reach me by Twitter DM or by email if you spot a story you think I\u2019ve missed, or have a suggestion for coverage. I won\u2019t always be able to reply, but will read all your messages. Thanks in advance. Virgin Atlantic seeks urgent rescue package worth up to \u00a3900m Virgin Atlantic is attempting to secure a privately funded rescue deal worth up to \u00a3900m by the end of this week as it fights to survive after the slump in international travel during the coronavirus pandemic. The airline is in talks with hedge funds about borrowing about \u00a3250m and is lining up more than \u00a3200m from shareholders including founder Sir Richard Branson and Delta Airlines, which owns 49% of the company. My colleague Sarah Butler has the full report: The number of coronavirus cases in Florida rose by 8,530 to 141,075 on Sunday, according to the state health department. People living in the UK can see how Covid-19 has progressed in their local area using our interactive map: Earlier today the home secretary, Priti Patel confirmed, Leicester could be the first place in England to face local lockdown amid a rise in coronavirus cases. Read more on that here: Britain\u2019s death toll from confirmed cases of Covid-19 has risen by 36 to 43,550, government figures showed on Sunday: Madrid records first day with no Covid-19 deaths For the first time in months, Spain\u2019s hardest-hit region has registered zero deaths from the coronavirus. \u201cGreat news,\u201d regional leader Isabel Ayuso wrote on Twitter on Sunday. \u201cYesterday marked the first day that Madrid did not register any deaths due to Covid-19. Together we can make sure this nightmare doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Across Spain 28,341 lives have been claimed by the virus, with more than 8,400 in Madrid, according to the health ministry. The figure, however, includes only those who tested positive, meaning that the thousands of excess deaths recorded in the same time period are not counted, even when the cause of death is suspected to be Covid-19. With the number of deaths across Spain dropping to a handful each day, health officials say the focus is now on monitoring 25 active outbreaks across the country. The largest is in the northeastern province of Huesca, where 290 people have tested positive. The localised outbreaks comes as Spain scrambles to salvage its tourist industry, which accounts for 12% of the country\u2019s GDP. While Spain opened its doors to EU and Schengen tourists last week, it has decided to extend a ban on cruise ships docking at its ports, according to a ministerial order published on Saturday. Prior to the crisis, cruise ships regularly ferried thousands of passengers to ports in Barcelona and Malaga as well as in the Balearic and Canary Islands. Nicola Sturgeon has said she feels \u201cenormous\u201d relief after no new coronavirus deaths were recorded in Scotland for a third day in a row. Covid-19 figures released on Sunday showed no new deaths of people who had tested positive within the previous 24 hours. The total number of people who have died under the measurement remains at 2,482, unchanged from Friday. Eight more people tested positive for the virus and 452 people are in Scottish hospitals with confirmed or suspected cases. There were five people in intensive care with confirmed cases of Covid-19 and eight with suspected cases. The first minister tweeted her response to the figures on Sunday afternoon, saying it was vital that people continued to follow the rules as the figures improved. Risk of death in UK care homes 13 times higher than in Germany Care home residents were more likely to die of Covid-19 in the UK than in any of the major European countries apart from Spain, analysis of global data has revealed. The proportion of residents dying in UK homes was a third higher than in Ireland and Italy, about double that in France and Sweden and 13 times higher than Germany. The analysis of official statistics was carried out by academics at the London School of Economics as part of the International Long Term Care Policy Network. My colleague Robert Booth has the full report: Iceland\u2019s President Gudni Johannesson has been re-elected with a whopping 92% of the vote, according to results released on Sunday. The former history professor won his second four-year term in the largely symbolic position in Saturday\u2019s vote, the second election held by a European country after coronavirus lockdowns were lifted. Since suffering spectacular bank failures in 2008, the volcanic North Atlantic island of 365,000 inhabitants has recovered some economic and political stability, which worked in the 52-year-old independent\u2019s favour. The final results showed he took 92.2% of the 168,821 votes cast, crushing rightwing challenger Gudmundur Franklin Jonsson. \u201cI am honoured and proud,\u201d the president told AFP in Reykjavik on election night. \u201cThis result of this election is, to me, proof of the fact that my fellow Icelanders... have approved of how I have approached this office.\u201d The dominant win had been predicted by opinion polls, which had shown the president winning between 90 to 94%. It is the second-highest margin of victory in the history of Iceland\u2019s presidential elections. Vigdis Finnbogadottir, the first woman in the world to be democratically elected as head of state, holds the record, winning re-election in 1988 with 94.6 percent of the vote. In this parliamentary republic, the president is largely symbolic, but he or she does have the power to veto legislation or submit it to a referendum. There are no term limits \u2013 Johannesson\u2019s predecessor Olafur Ragnar Grimsson served for five terms. Turnout for Saturday\u2019s vote was 66.9%, dropping from 75.7% during Johannesson\u2019s first election victory in 2016, when he became the country\u2019s youngest president since independence in 1944. Challenger Jonsson is a former Wall Street broker close to Icelandic nationalists and a vocal fan of US President Donald Trump. He campaigned on wanting Iceland\u2019s president to play a more active role by exercising the right to veto legislation campaigns, but struggled to gain traction with voters. \u201cI send my congratulations to Gudni and his family,\u201d Jonsson told public broadcaster RUV. The coronavirus pandemic had not been expected to affect voting, as the country has been only mildly infected. It has reported 10 deaths, and currently has around 11 active cases. The coronavirus \u2018long-haulers\u2019 show how little we still know Infectious disease expert professor Debbie Bogaert describes herself as a Covid-19 \u201clong-hauler\u201d \u2013 someone who initially had mild symptoms of the disease but went on to experience a range of sometimes severe symptoms for weeks or even months. Here she describes how this condition has been the ultimate challenge of both her career and her personal life \u2013 and also shows how much more we need to learn: Screen survivors of Covid-19 for PTSD, say mental health experts Tens of thousands of Covid-19 survivors in the UK should be screened for post-traumatic stress disorder because of their experiences in fighting for their lives, mental health experts have urged. Leading psychiatrists and psychologists want NHS bosses to ensure that all those who were admitted to hospital when they became seriously ill with the disease is assessed and checked regularly. Survivors showing signs of PTSD would undergo treatment to prevent nightmares and flashbacks that could blight the rest of their lives. My colleague Denis Campbell has the full report: The Greek island of Kos will host dozens of German doctors for free from Monday, AFP reports. This announcement from the tourism ministry comes as the country prepares to reopen its regional airports to passenger flights. The visiting 170 doctors will be hosted for free \u201cin recognition and gratitude for their contribution in combating the coronavirus in Germany,\u201d the Greek tourism ministry said on Sunday. Officials from German tour operator TUI will be among the passengers and will meet with tourism minister Harry Theoharis on the island, the ministry said. The flight from Germany will land two days before Greece is officially scheduled to open its regional airports to passenger traffic on July 1. Greece has registered fewer than 200 deaths attributed to Covid-19. With a quarter of the nation\u2019s economy dependent on tourism, the government seeks to reassure potential visitors they can safely vacation in Greece as Europe begins to open back up to travel. Nearly 80 hotels nationwide have been set aside to exclusively accommodate Covid-19 cases, state TV ERT said. Hundreds of tests are to be conducted daily at regional and island airports around the country, according to the civil protection authority. Passengers will have to fill out locator forms, including their address of stay, at least 48 hours before entering the country. The EU has yet to determine a list of \u2018safe\u2019 countries allowed to visit Europe. The proposed list so far includes Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay. Thousands of transgender people and their supporters marched through central London to Parliament Square on Saturday to celebrate the black transgender community, and protest against potential amendments to the Gender Recognition Act. Check out this photo gallery, showing protesters carrying creative placards and donning masks as the UK continues to grapple with the Covid-19 crisis. Hong Kong police arrested at least 53 people on Sunday after scuffles erupted during a relatively peaceful protest against planned national security legislation to be implemented by the mainland Chinese government. The protest came a day after Hong Kong police refused permission for an annual march usually held on July 1 to mark the 1997 handover, citing a ban on large gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic. Armed riot police were present as a crowd of several hundred moved from Jordan to Mong Kok in the Kowloon district, staging what was intended as a \u201csilent protest\u201d against the planned law. However, chanting and slogans were shouted towards police and later scuffles broke out in Mong Kok, prompting police to use pepper spray to subdue parts of the crowd. Hong Kong Police said on Facebook that 53 people had been arrested and charged with unlawful assembly, adding that earlier some protesters tried to blockade roads in the area. The proposed national security law has raised concerns among Hong Kong democracy activists and some foreign governments that Beijing is further eroding the extensive autonomy promised when Britain handed the territory back to China in 1997. \u201cThe governments wants to shut us up and to kick us out,\u201d one protester, Roy Chan, 44, said. \u201cWe must stand up and strike down all those people who deprive Hong Kong people\u2019s freedom.\u201d China has said the law will target only a small group of troublemakers as it tackles separatism, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference in Hong Kong. China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress Standing Committee reviewed a draft of the bill on Sunday, according to state media Xinhua. China has said it is determined to enact the law, and its passage is expected by Tuesday. PM promises to spend big to \u2018build UK back to health\u2019 Boris Johnson has promised to spend billions of pounds to rescue the economy as he warned the country faces the looming \u201cthunderclap of economic consequences\u201d of Covid-19. The prime minister tweeted: \u201cWe want to build our way back to health. \u201cIf covid was a lightning flash, we\u2019re about to have the thunderclap of the economic consequences. We\u2019re going to be ready.\u201d In an earlier interview with the Mail on Sunday he recommitted to his general election promise of a \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda, saying new schools, hospitals and homes would be built, infrastructure projects completed and employment created for people whose \u201cold jobs\u201d would not be there any more. My colleague Kate Proctor and Jamie Grierson have the full report: This is Aaron Walawalkar in London here, bringing you the latest global developments in the coronavirus pandemic. As always, please drop me a line with any updates via DM on Twitter @AaronWala. Here are the major developments as of lunchtime today: The total number of people to test positive for Covid-19 worldwide has exceeded 10million, according to Johns Hopkins university. Meanwhile, the number of global deaths stands at 499,296. Leicester may be the first city in the UK to face a localised lockdown following a rise in Covid-19 cases, home secretary Priti Patel has confirmed. South Korea is to begin allowing limited number of spectators at sports games, as it seeks to return to normal after months of strict social distancing rules to combat the coronavirus. LGBT+ Brazilians are being disproportionately impacted by Covid-19 job losses, a survey has found. A report by advocacy group #VoteLGBT has found that one in four unemployed gay and trans Brazilians has lost their job recently during the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 almost double the nation\u2019s overall rate. The number of confirmed deaths from Covid-19 in Afghanistan has risen by 34 to 737. Mask-wearing will be mandatory in certain areas of Iran as of next week and virus-hit provinces can reimpose restrictive measures, President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday. Pride parades have gone head in the Taiwanese capital, placing it among only a handful of places to do so in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. Those who joined the crowds in Taipei said it was a testament both to nation\u2019s ability to contain the pandemic and its commitment to rights for people of all sexual orientations. Sri Lanka officially lifted its nationwide lockdown on Sunday, after a selective curfew was reimposed a month ago during a surge in coronavirus infections. The island nation imposed the lockdown on March 20 and lifted it gradually over the past two months, although a nighttime curfew remained in place. Sri Lanka\u2019s nationwide lockdown was lifted on Sunday after a selective curfew a month ago was reimposed during a surge in coronavirus infections, the country\u2019s president said. The island nation imposed the lockdown on March 20 and lifted it gradually over the past two months, although a nighttime curfew remained in place. It reintroduced tighter restrictions in late May and early June to curb large gatherings for the funeral of a popular government minister and for a religious festival. \u201cThe curfew has completely been lifted effective from today,\u201d President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s office said in a statement. Health officials said new infections reported since April 30 were from Sri Lankans stranded in the Middle East who were brought home on special flights and quarantined. A cluster in a navy camp was controlled with the facility still in lock down, they said. \u201cThere has been no community spread of the virus and the infections at the Welisara navy camp are now contained,\u201d a health official told AFP. Air and sea borders remained closed, with international flights suspended. Authorities plan to reopen Sri Lanka\u2019s borders on August 1, but the date could be reviewed due to the imported cases, the official added. Sri Lanka will also hold its parliamentary elections at the start of August after they were postponed due to the pandemic. Around 2,000 infections including 11 deaths have been recorded in the South Asian nation so far, according to government figures. Pride parades go on in Taiwan amid pandemic The Taiwanese capital held its annual LGBT pride parade on Sunday, making it one of the few places in the world to proceed with such an event in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. The parade in Taipei has drawn tens of thousands of people in the past, but participant numbers Sunday were reduced by both virus concerns and heavy rain. Still, those who did take part said it was a testament both to Taiwan\u2019s ability to contain the pandemic and its commitment to rights for people of all sexual orientations. Taiwan is the only place in Asia where same-sex marriage is legal, and its liberal political system has long promoted human rights, free speech and freedom of assembly. American student Loren Couse, 28, said Taipei\u2019s ability to put on the parade was \u201creally impressive\u201d. \u201cI think Taiwan has done a really good job so far, and I am really proud of living here, not only because its so open to people like myself, the gay community, but also because I think its such an example for the world and how to handle the pandemic so far,\u201d Couse said. New York was among the cities compelled to cancel its gay pride parade this year to comply with social distancing measures. Taiwan has largely dropped such restrictions after quarantines and case tracing helped bring the coronavirus infection rate down radically. In all, the island of 23.7 million people has confirmed 447 cases, including seven deaths. Patel confirms Leicester may face local lockdown Leicester may be the first city in the UK to face a localised lockdown following a rise in Covid-19 cases, Home Secretary Priti Patel has confirmed. Patel on Sunday told BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show it was \u201ccorrect\u201d that the government was considering the move, first reported in the Sunday Times. \u201cWe have seen flare-ups across the country in recent weeks, in just the last three or four weeks in particular,\u201d she said. She added: There will be support going into Leicester and in fact the Health Secretary (Matthew Hancock) was in touch with many of us over the weekend explaining some of the measures, the support on testing, resources that will go into the local authority as well. With local flare-ups it is right we have a localised solution in terms of infection control, social distancing, testing and many of the tools actually within the Public Health England space which will come together to control the virus, to stop the spread so obviously we can get on top of the infection. LGBT+ Brazilians disproportionately hit by Covid-19 job losses One in four unemployed gay and trans Brazilians has lost their job recently during the coronavirus outbreak, a survey released on Sunday found, showing the joblessness among LGBT+ Brazilians almost double the nation\u2019s overall rate. Four in 10 LGBT+ people, and more than half of transgender people, said they would not be able to survive without income for more than a month, according to the survey from advocacy group #VoteLGBT. As Brazil emerges as one of the globe\u2019s coronavirus hotspots, LGBT+ residents especially are vulnerable as they struggle with issues of health care, work and income, the research said. Brazil has registered more than 1.2 million cases of coronavirus since the pandemic began, among the highest in the world, with deaths of about 55,000, according to the health ministry. Its unemployment rate rose to 12.6% in the three months to April, the highest in over a year, with nearly 5 million people leaving the workforce. Official unemployment data for May will be released this week. But LGBT+ Brazilians reported an unemployment rate of 21.6%, according to the #VoteLGBT survey. The actual figure is likely higher because the numbers were drawn from an online survey, said Fernanda De Lena, a demographer and #VoteLGBT member. She said: People without an electronic device to answer the questionnaire are not being counted ... So the number of unemployed is likely underestimated. Brazil\u2019s central bank has predicted the nation\u2019s economy will shrink by 6.4% this year, due largely to the economic fallout caused by the pandemic, while the International Monetary Fund has predicted a contraction of 9.1% this year. The survey also found near unanimous criticism by gay and trans Brazilians of the handling of the crisis by President Jair Bolsonaro, well-known for making homophobic comments. Nearly 99% said his performance was \u201cbad or terrible,\u201d it found. Bolsonaro has been widely criticized for the ways he has dealt with the crisis, shunning social distancing measures and promoting anti-malarial drugs as remedies with little evidence. Bolsonaro is sometimes called the \u201cTropical Trump\u201d by those who view his responses to the pandemic as similar to those of U.S. President Donald Trump. American approval of Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic recently dropped to 37%, the lowest level on record, in the latest Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll. Trump was slow to publicly acknowledge the severity of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 120,000 Americans so far, and he has pushed states to reopen before experts said it was safe to do so. In Brazil, despite a number of recent advancements on LGBT+ rights, including a 2019 Supreme Court ruling outlawing homophobia and transphobia, gay and trans people face societal prejudice and widespread violence. This year, 89 trans people were murdered in Brazil, according to a report this week from advocacy group ANTRA, a 39% increase on the first six months of 2019. Reporting by Thompson Reuters Foundation South Korea will begin allowing limited numbers of spectators at sports games as it seeks to return to normal after months of strict social distancing rules to combat the coronavirus. The country endured one of the worst early outbreaks of the disease outside China but appears to have brought it broadly under control with an extensive \u201ctrace, test and treat\u201d programme while never imposing a compulsory lockdown. Social distancing rules were relaxed in early May and some professional sports - including baseball and soccer - started new seasons albeit behind closed doors. \u201cWe will take phased measures including allowing spectators at sports events,\u201d health minister Park Neung-hoo told reporters on Sunday, without elaborating. South Korea\u2019s sports ministry is expected to hold a meeting this week to discuss the details, Yonhap news agency reported, and the Korea Baseball Organisation is preparing to fill around 30% of stands at its games. The move comes despite alarm over a second wave of infections in recent weeks, with the South seeing around 35 to 50 new cases a day, mostly in the Seoul metropolitan area where half of the population lives. Officials reimposed some social distancing measures in late May following fresh clusters in and near Seoul, and most cases reported in the past week have been domestic infections. Of 62 new cases reported on Sunday - taking the country\u2019s total to 12,715 - 40 were domestic infections while 22 were people arriving from overseas. The total number of people to test positive for Covid-19 worldwide has passed 10million, according to Johns Hopkins university. There were 10,001,527 coronavirus cases globally on Sunday, according to the university\u2019s coronavirus resource centre. The total number of deaths worldwide is currently stands at 499,124. Comedian Sacha Baron Cohen is believed to have gatecrashed a US gun rally in disguise and pranked attendees into joining him in a sing-a-long about injecting scientists and politicians with the \u201cWuhan flu\u201d. Footage circulating on social media shows a bearded man in dungarees and a cowboy hat taking the stage at the March for our Rights rally in Olympia, Washington, on Sunday. Against a country music soundtrack, the man teaches the crowd the lyrics of a call-and-response refrain, bearing many of the hallmarks of a Sacha Baron Cohen prank. \u201cObama, what ya gonna do?\u201d the singer says. \u201cInject him with the Wuhan flu,\u201d crowd members respond. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly referred to the coronavirus using similarly insensitive terminology, which civil liberties groups fear will inspire racism against Asian Americans. The singer also name-checks US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci and former president Barack Obama. While a later iteration of the lyrics refers to \u201cchopping up\u201d the World Health Organisation \u201clike the Saudi\u2019s do\u201d \u2013 an apparent reference to the 2018 killing of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi by government agents in the Turkey. Cohen, the creator of characters Ali G and Borat, does not appear to have yet claimed responsibility for the prank. The actor last took on numerous disguises to star as a cast of characters in his 2018 political satire \u201cWho Is America?\u201d. The number of confirmed deaths from Covid-19 in Afghanistan has risen by 34 to 737, as the western province of Badghis recorded its worst day of the crisis while violence rages on across the country. Local officials have said that the actual number of deaths is much higher than these official figures, which were released by the health ministry on Sunday. The health ministry, which has admitted that it has a lack of testing capacity, recorded 351 new cases from 701 tests in last 24 hours, taking the total number of confirmed infections to 30,967. Afghanistan has tested 70,788 suspected patients since the outbreak began. There have been 12,588 recoveries, including 2,004 in last 24 hours. Most new cases (220) have been reported in the nation\u2019s capital Kabul, where eight patients died overnight. Testing had been halted for a day in Kabul due to a \u201cproblem\u201d in its laboratories. The capital has been the country\u2019s worst affected area with 12,766 cases and 164 deaths. The western province of Badghis, which has been battlefield of Taliban and Afghan forces in recent days, recorded its worst day of the crisis after 17 patients died from Covid-19 overnight. The remote province of Kapisa recorded its first death, leaving only one province without confirmed death of Covid-19 in the country. Meanwhile, violence is raging on with full intensity across the war-torn country as according to the country\u2019s national security council, at least 21 civilians were killed and 30 others were wounded in Taliban violence during the last week. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission says that two of its employees were killed in an explosion that targeted their vehicle in Kabul on Saturday. The victims were Fatima Khalil, 24, and her driver, Jawid Folad, 41, which sparked international condemnation. Taliban, in a statement, denied involvement in the attack. \u201cMs Khalil was a young human rights defender at the beginning of her career. That she will not be able to fulfil her enormous potential is a tragedy. Mr Folad was one of the Commission\u2019s longest serving and loyal drivers,\u201d the commission said in a statement. \u201cWe condemn such a heinous attack on our employees in the strongest possible terms. As of now, no group has claimed the responsibility of the attack and the perpetrators have not been identified yet. Those responsible should be identified after an investigation and brought to justice for committing this terrible crime.\u201d President Ashraf Ghani on Saturday called on the Taliban to end the violence and instead come forward to start the intra-Afghan talks. Mask-wearing will be mandatory in certain areas of Iran as of next week and virus-hit provinces can reimpose restrictive measures, President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday. The Islamic republic has refrained from enforcing full lockdowns to stop the spread of Covid-19, and the use of masks and protective equipment has been optional in most areas. Mask-wearing would be \u201cobligatory in covered spaces where there are gatherings\u201d, Rouhani said during a televised meeting of the country\u2019s anti-virus taskforce. The measure would come into force as of next week, continue until July 22 and would be extended if necessary, he said. Rouhani said the health ministry had devised \u201ca clear list\u201d of the types of spaces and gatherings deemed high-risk, but he did not elaborate. He also did not say what the penalty would be for those who fail to observe the measure. According to deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi, \u201cservices will not be given\u201d to those without masks in areas such as \u201cgovernment organisations and shopping malls\u201d. Iran reported its first Covid-19 cases on February 19 and it has since struggled to contain the outbreak as the death toll has crossed 10,000 and the number of infected reached more than 220,000. Official figures have shown a rising trajectory in new confirmed cases since early May, when Iran hit a near two-month low in daily recorded infections. The increasing caseload has seen some previously unscathed provinces classified as \u201cred\u201d - the highest level on Iran\u2019s colour-coded risk scale - with authorities allowing them to reimpose restrictive measures if required. According to Rouhani, the measure would be also extended to provinces with \u201cred\u201d counties. \u201cAny county that is red, its provincial (virus) committee can propose reimposing limitations for a week,\u201d which could be extended if needed, he said. The health ministry launched an \u201c\u001dI wear a mask\u201d campaign on Saturday and pleaded with Iranians to observe guidelines aimed at curbing infections. One Iranian is infected with Covid-19 every 33 seconds and one dies from the disease every 13 minutes, Harirchi said on Saturday. \u2018Constant vigilance\u2019 needed as UK lockdown eases The UK needs to maintain \u201cconstant vigilance\u201d as it eases out of lockdown, a former government chief scientific adviser has warned. Sir Mark Walport said on Sunday that the UK government faces a \u201cfine balancing act\u201d between managing the virus outbreak and the health harms caused by a damaged economy. Speaking to Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, he said people needed to be \u201csensible and responsible\u201d, and to try and reduce social contact as much as possible. Citing coronavirus case numbers, he said: \u201cThe virus is out there, it is very widely distributed and we have to have constant vigilance.\u201d Asked whether a second spike of the coronavirus outbreak was inevitable, Walport added: When outbreaks occur they typically occur in clusters and we\u2019re seeing certain work environments, for example, food processing factories, as being fairly common places for those clusters to rise. The common denominator is really being indoors, being crowded, being there for prolonged periods of time, noisy environments where people are coughing and shouting, and so there\u2019s more droplet transmission. It comes back to local control being really important to identify those clusters when they happen and clamp down on them quickly. We need to do everything we possibly can to avoid a widespread second wave. The evidence that the virus does transmit better in cold workplaces again suggests that winter might be quite a risky time again.\u201d Asked if the virus could come back in winter when the NHS is under more pressure, Walport said: \u201cThat is obviously a significant risk.\u201d He said that the virus probably lasts longer in the air and on surfaces in cold and wet environments. The total number of people to die from Covid-19 in Russia has increased by 104 to 9,073, according to the country\u2019s coronavirus response centre. Russia on Sunday also reported 6,791 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, taking the nationwide tally to 634,437. That is a slightly smaller increase than that seen the previous day \u2013 when there were 6,852 new cases. It is also the third day in a row since late April when the daily number of new cases was below 7,000. A summit that included a star-studded virtual concert hosted by Dwayne Johnson has raised nearly $7billion in cash and loan guarantees to assist the poor around the globe whose lives have been upended by the coronavirus pandemic, AP reports. Global Citizen said its summit with world leaders had raised $1.5 billion to help Covid-19 efforts in poor countries, along with a promise of 250m doses of a vaccine for those nations if one is successfully developed. The group said it had secured $5.4 billion in loans and guarantees from the European Commission and the European Investment Bank to support fragile economies worldwide. The event included a Johnson-hosted concert with performances by Jennifer Hudson, Miley Cyrus, Coldplay and Chloe x Halle. Cyrus performed The Beatles Help! in an empty stadium and Hudson performed Where Peaceful Waters Flow from a boat in Chicago. \u201cThe $6.9 billion that was pledged today to support the worlds poorest and most marginalised communities is an incredible next step on our journey out of the Covid-19 era, but there is more still to be done, as no one is safe until everyone is safe,\u201d Hugh Evans, CEO of Global Citizen, said after the event Saturday. \u201cAs we fight this virus, we also need to take care of the most vulnerable people and address the challenges they\u2019re facing right now,\u201d Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said during the event. Speakers also included the leaders of New Zealand, El Salvador, Sweden, South Africa and Barbados. France holds latest round of delayed municipal elections Five thousand towns and cities across France are holding the second round of municipal elections which had been postponed due to the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, AP reports. The voting to fill local offices in Paris and thousands of other places was suspended after the first round of the nationwide municipal elections on March 15, which produced decisive outcomes in some 30,000 other mostly small communes. Voters are set to choose mayors and municipal councillors on Sunday at polling stations operating under strict hygiene rules. It is mandatory that voters wear face masks, use soap or hand sanitizer and maintain one meter (about three feet) of physical distance between each other in queues. They have also been told to bring their own pens to sign the register. The spread of the coronavirus has slowed significantly in France in recent weeks and almost all restrictions on social and business activity were gradually lifted over the last month. France has reported nearly 200,000 confirmed cases and 29,781 deaths in the pandemic. But the virus is still expected to hurt Sunday\u2019s turnout, as it did in March. Only 44.7% of voters, a record low, cast ballots in the first round of the municipal elections. The elections, though ostensibly focused on local concerns, are also seen as a key political indicator ahead of the 2022 French presidential election. The main battleground is Paris, where the mayor is an influential figure in French politics and will oversee the 2024 Olympics. Paris mayor Annie Hidalgo, a Socialist Party member, finished in March with a strong lead ahead of conservative candidate Rachida Dati. French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s three-year-old centrist party is fielding municipal candidates for the first time and still lacks local roots across France. The party, Republic on the Move, doesn\u2019t have candidates in every race and in some instances is backing candidates from both the left and the right instead. Macron\u2019s government has faced criticism during the pandemic over mask shortages, testing capacity and a lack of medical equipment. A government reshuffle is expected in the wake of Sunday\u2019s elections. Recent opinion polls show Macron\u2019s popularity rating is hovering around 40%, which is higher than it was before the virus outbreak. This is Aaron Walawalkar in London here, steering you through the latest global developments in the coronavirus pandemic as the total number of confirmed cases worldwide approaches 10million. If there\u2019s any updates you think I should include in here, please let me know via DM on Twitter @AaronWala. I may not be able to reply to all of your messages due to the level on interest \u2013 but I will certainly read them. The daily number of new coronavirus cases in the Czech Republic has increased to 260, the highest since April 8, Health Ministry data showed on Sunday. That is nearly triple that of the 93 recorded on Thursday. In total, the country of 10.7 million has confirmed 11,298 cases of the Covid-19 illness, with 347 deaths as of Saturday. Chief public health officer, Jarmila Razova, told public Czech Radio on Saturday that the rise could be linked to intensive testing in local hotbeds of the infection. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for the weekend. Thanks for following along! My colleague Aaron Walawalkar will be bringing you the latest pandemic news for the next while. Here are the main developments around the world from the last few hours: As cases near 10m, nearly half a million people have died over the course of the pandemic. The current death toll stands at 498,841, according to Johns Hopkins University. The number of infections is 9,984,111. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States rose to more than 2.5 million on Saturday. More than 125,000 Americans have died of Covid-19, the highest known death toll from the disease in the world. New York Times chief White House correspondent Peter Baker noted on Twitter that more Americans have died than in the Vietnam War since US President Donald Trump stopped his daily coronavirus task force briefings at the White House. Video footage appears to show Trump campaign removing social-distancing stickers in Tulsa. Video has emerged of Trump campaign volunteers apparently removing social distancing stickers from seats in the arena where the US president gave a campaign rally that many public health experts had warned against because of the still-surging coronavirus pandemic. China reported 17 new cases. Mainland China on Sunday reported 17 new coronavirus cases, mostly in the Chinese capital of Beijing. The National Health Commission said 17 new infections were confirmed on Saturday, down from 21 a day earlier. In Beijing, 14 new confirmed cases were reported, down from 17 a day earlier. South Korea reported 62 new cases. South Korea South Korea has confirmed 62 additional cases of the coronavirus over a 24-hour period as the Asian country continues to face new clusters of infections amid eased social distancing rules. The additional cases reported Sunday took the country\u2019s total to 12,715, with 282 deaths. New Zealand\u2019s Covid-19 isolation facilities are under \u2018extreme stress\u2019, review finds. A review of New Zealand\u2019s managed isolation and quarantine facilities has found that the system is under \u201cextreme stress\u201d as more and more Kiwis return home. It came as four more returnees tested positive to Covid-19 in the biggest one-day jump in cases in two months. The US states of Florida, Arizona, Nevada, South Carolina and Georgia each recorded daily highs for coronavirus infections on Saturday, highlighting the worsening spread of the virus in several southern and western states, which is prompting some of them to roll back their reopening plans. Brazil recorded 38,693 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours and 1,109 additional deaths. The country has now registered 1,313,667 total confirmed cases of the virus and 57,070 deaths. A growing number of Covid-19 infections among people under 35 years of age is a \u201cworrying trend,\u201d Ireland\u2019s chief medical officer said on Saturday as the country reported the highest number of new infections for two weeks. Key recent developments in Australia include: Victoria, Australia is considering roadblocks and checkpointsafter cases passed 2,000. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, says the state will consider potential stay-at-home orders and suburban lockdowns to contain several coronavirus clusters in Melbourne, after another 49 cases of coronavirus were detected on Saturday \u2013 the highest daily number since April \u2013 all people coming from overseas. The state\u2019s total is 2,028. Queensland and South Australia had no new cases.Victoria is conducting a testing blitz in an attempt to prevent further spread of the virus. About 40,000 people have been tested since Friday. The Morrison government denied reports it will permanently lift unemployment benefit payments. The Morrison government has denied it about to permanently lift unemployment benefit payments when the treasurer makes a long-awaited economic statement next month. News Corp newspapers, citing senior ministers, had reported the jobseeker payment would rise to $75 per day from $40 when the present enhanced version of the unemployment payment ends in September. \u201cThere are no such proposals before the government or under consideration for the economic statement next month,\u201d a spokesperson for social services minister Anne Ruston told Australian Associated Press. New South Wales, Australia recorded 3 new cases. Three new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the state of New South Wales, the state health department reported in a statement, bringing the total number of cases in NSW to 3,177.Two of the cases are travellers in hotel quarantine, and the third case is an overseas cargo airline crew member. The crew member\u2019s close contacts have been identified, the statement notes, and \u201cfurther investigations are underway.\u201d Western Australia confirmed 1 new case. The state of Western Australia has confirmed 1 new case of coronavirus, the health department announced on Sunday, to bring the state total to 609. The case is a traveller in hotel quarantine. Queensland, Australia recorded zero new cases. Queensland recorded no new coronavirus cases overnight but the government will wait until Tuesday to announce any easing of restrictions. Queenslanders will have to wait 48 hours to know when and how Covid-19 restrictions will be lifted after the transport minister stonewalled questions about borders reopening. Under the mountains of Mourne close to Castlewellan Forest Park\u2019s lake, a young family were celebrating the liberation of campsites from lockdown in Northern Ireland. Before the lifting of restrictions on caravan and camping parks in the rest of the UK, the Kon family had driven for an hour from their Newtonabbey home on the northern outskirts of Belfast to this County Down beauty spot. Mirchin Kon and his wife Natalia had pitched their tent in a field on Friday afternoon before toasting their regained freedom to camp with bottled German lager. While their daughters Amber and Olivia played with their dolls on a blanket spread out in front of their tented home, Mirchin said the prospect of going back to the forest park was a comfort they held on to during the coronavirus shutdown. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve been dreaming of this day since we went into lockdown. It\u2019s been one of the things that has kept us going over the last few months. We only came here once before and really liked this place so we promised ourselves that once it was open again we should come back.\u201d Others huddled around tents and camper vans appeared on Friday to be obeying social distancing rules. They had positioned themselves across the verdant, sun-dappled field with suitably safe amounts of space between each other. Whatever the new normal is post Covid-19, we don\u2019t want it to be anything like the old one. At least, when it comes to earning a living. Lockdown has given people a chance to sample new ways of balancing their jobs and family lives and they have concluded that something must change. Just 13% want to go back to pre-pandemic ways of working, with most people saying they would prefer to spend a maximum of three days in the office. A survey of 1,500 people carried out for Bright Horizons, the nursery provider, suggests that many working parents realise that large parts of their jobs can be conducted remotely. And they believe that their employers will agree. Nearly two-thirds think their employers will be open to remote or flexible working in the future as the widespread adoption of Zoom and other online tools has kept many businesses functioning even as physical workplaces have been shuttered. Almost half \u2013 48% \u2013 of those who worked in an office before lockdown said they were considering asking for some more remote working. Adisaster is unfolding in Montgomery, Alabama, where Martin Luther King preached and where Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on the bus. Hospitals are running short of drugs to treat Covid-19, intensive care units are close to capacity, and ventilators are running short. Between 85% and 90% of the very sick and dying are African American. Amid this gathering storm, the city council met to decide whether to require people to wear masks, a basic protection the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) strongly recommends. Doctors lined up to plead their case. \u201cThis is beyond an epidemic in this area,\u201d said the pulmonologist Bill Saliski. \u201cOur units are full of critically ill covid patients. We have to slow this down.\u201d His colleague, Nina Nelson-Garrett, described watching undertakers carrying out corpses, 30 minutes apart. \u201cSomething as simple as a mask can save someone\u2019s life,\u201d she said. Poles began voting in a presidential election Sunday that had originally been scheduled for May but was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, AP reports. President Andrzej Duda, a 48-year-old conservative backed by the ruling party, is running against 10 other candidates as he seeks a second 5-year term. Most recent polls showed that no single candidate was likely to reach the 50% required to avoid a runoff. In that case, the two top vote-getters will face each other 12 July. Polling stations remain open until 9pm (19.00 GMT), and exit polls will be announced immediately after. The final officials results are expected by Wednesday at the latest. Poland has not been as badly hit by the pandemic as many countries in Western Europe, and most people were voting in person, though required to wear masks and observe other hygiene rules. There was also a mail-in voting option, while thousands in some southwestern regions with higher numbers of infection were also required to vote by mail. As of Sunday, there were about 34,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the nation of 38 million people, with some 1,400 deaths. Global coronavirus cases are expected to tip over 10 million on Sunday, marking a major milestone in the spread of the disease that has so far killed almost 500,000 people in seven months. The figure is roughly double the number of severe influenza illnesses recorded annually, according to the World Health Organisation. The milestone approaches as many hard-hit countries are easing lockdowns, while making extensive alterations to work and social life that could last for a year or more until a vaccine becomes available, if it ever does. Some countries are experiencing a resurgence in infections, including the United States, which reported 44,000 news cases to 4pm Friday, its biggest daily increase in the pandemic. Its previous biggest increase was on Thursday, when it recorded 40,0000 cases. Lockdowns have been reinstated in several countries, including parts of the US. Texas \u2013 one of the earliest states to return to business \u2013 reimposed lockdown measures. Bars \u2013 which were open at up to 50% capacity \u2013 must close again, restaurants must reduce from 75% to 50% capacity and rafting operations must close. Harris County, which includes Houston, moved to its highest Covid-19 threat level, signalling a \u201csevere and uncontrolled\u201d outbreak. Fifty years on from the first Gay Pride march, the LGBT community and their supporters took many of their events online Saturday, responding to the threat of the coronavirus pandemic, AFP reports. While some activists took to the streets to mark the event, much of the movement\u2019s energy was channelled into Global Pride, a 24-hour online event broadcast live online. London Pride, one of the biggest events in the Gay Pride calendar, was one major victim of the new restrictions imposed by the pandemic. Online events replaced it under the slogan: \u201cPostponed, but still united\u201d. But veteran campaigner Peter Tatchell, wearing a rainbow-coloured mask, led a group of 12 fellow activists to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the London Gay Liberation Front. \u201cWe are seeking to reclaim Pride as an event for LGBT+ human rights,\u201d said the 68-year-old campaigner. In Berlin, police estimated that around 3,500 people marched in temperatures of around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit). Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tweeted a message of support to the Global Pride event: \u201cBe proud of yourself! No matter who you love, no matter where you live.\u201d In Vienna, around 200 cars and motorbikes decked out in rainbow flags and inflatable unicorns paraded down the city\u2019s famous Ringstrasse on Saturday afternoon. Organisers said around 5,000 people turned out to watch the scaled-down event. Vienna\u2019s Rainbow Parade, which normally attracts hundreds of thousands of people, was otherwise replaced by online events. Here\u2019s a look at today\u2019s coronavirus-related front pages in the UK: Ireland will maintain a 14-day quarantine for travellers from the British mainland in July even as it plans to ease travel restrictions with some countries, the Sunday Times reports, citing a memo. The memo with the Irish cabinet committee said it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that Britain would be included in Ireland\u2019s safe travel list, the report added. Ireland plans to lift from July 9 a 14-day quarantine for people arriving from countries that have also suppressed the coronavirus, the Irish government said on Thursday. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 256 to 193,499, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Sunday. The reported death toll rose by three to 8,957. The Observer view on the inept and dangerous handling of the easing of lockdown: In the past few days, one thing has become depressingly clear: the riddling and misleading communication that has characterised this government\u2019s failure to control the pandemic will not find an antidote in the near future. On Wednesday in parliament the prime minister was asked a simple question by Peter Kyle, Labour MP for the seaside constituency of Hove. It was certain, Kyle noted, that with the relaxing of restrictions on socialising, coastal towns like his would become dangerously packed with visitors. \u201cWhat will the prime minister do in the absence of the promised [track and trace] app to make sure these communities are destinations for investment and not destinations for covid?\u201d Boris Johnson replied with typical scattergun harrumphing: \u201cI will be calling on local representatives such as himself to show some guts and determination and champion their communities as venues for people to return to and support!\u201d Those guts were everywhere on display on beaches by Thursday. Social distancing now designated at \u201cone metre plus\u201d had predictably collapsed to one metre minus. But still, given the prime minister\u2019s exhortation to Kyle at the dispatch box, the people who crammed the beaches \u2013 500,000 in Dorset alone \u2013 on the hottest day of the year could justify their day trips with the belief that they were simply doing their national duty. If they were to take Johnson at his word, drinking and barbecuing \u2013 and brawling and littering \u2013 was the new clap for carers. Here are the most important recent developments from around the world: As cases near 10m, nearly half a million people have died over the course of the pandemic. The current death toll stands at 498,217, according to Johns Hopkins University. The number of infections is 9,955,495. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States rose to more than 2.5 million on Saturday. More than 125,000 Americans have died of Covid-19, the highest known death toll from the disease in the world. New York Times chief White House correspondent Peter Baker noted on Twitter that more Americans have died than in the Vietnam War since US President Donald Trump stopped his daily coronavirus task force briefings at the White House. Video footage appears to show Trump campaign removing social-distancing stickers in Tulsa. Video has emerged of Trump campaign volunteers apparently removing social distancing stickers from seats in the arena where the US president gave a campaign rally that many public health experts had warned against because of the still-surging coronavirus pandemic. China reported 17 new cases. Mainland China on Sunday reported 17 new coronavirus cases, mostly in the Chinese capital of Beijing. The National Health Commission said 17 new infections were confirmed on Saturday, down from 21 a day earlier. In Beijing, 14 new confirmed cases were reported, down from 17 a day earlier. South Korea reported 62 new cases. South Korea South Korea has confirmed 62 additional cases of the coronavirus over a 24-hour period as the Asian country continues to face new clusters of infections amid eased social distancing rules. The additional cases reported Sunday took the country\u2019s total to 12,715, with 282 deaths. New Zealand\u2019s Covid-19 isolation facilities are under \u2018extreme stress\u2019, review finds. A review of New Zealand\u2019s managed isolation and quarantine facilities has found that the system is under \u201cextreme stress\u201d as more and more Kiwis return home. It came as four more returnees tested positive to Covid-19 in the biggest one-day jump in cases in two months. The US states of Florida, Arizona, Nevada, South Carolina and Georgia each recorded daily highs for coronavirus infections on Saturday, highlighting the worsening spread of the virus in several southern and western states, which is prompting some of them to roll back their reopening plans. Brazil recorded 38,693 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours and 1,109 additional deaths. The country has now registered 1,313,667 total confirmed cases of the virus and 57,070 deaths. A growing number of Covid-19 infections among people under 35 years of age is a \u201cworrying trend,\u201d Ireland\u2019s chief medical officer said on Saturday as the country reported the highest number of new infections for two weeks. Key recent developments in Australia include: Victoria, Australia is considering roadblocks and checkpoints after cases passed 2,000. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, says the state will consider potential stay-at-home orders and suburban lockdowns to contain several coronavirus clusters in Melbourne, after another 49 cases of coronavirus were detected on Saturday \u2013 the highest daily number since April \u2013 all people coming from overseas. The state\u2019s total is 2,028. Queensland and South Australia had no new cases.Victoria is conducting a testing blitz in an attempt to prevent further spread of the virus. About 40,000 people have been tested since Friday. The Morrison government denied reports it will permanently lift unemployment benefit payments. The Morrison government has denied it about to permanently lift unemployment benefit payments when the treasurer makes a long-awaited economic statement next month. News Corp newspapers, citing senior ministers, had reported the jobseeker payment would rise to $75 per day from $40 when the present enhanced version of the unemployment payment ends in September. \u201cThere are no such proposals before the government or under consideration for the economic statement next month,\u201d a spokesperson for social services minister Anne Ruston told Australian Associated Press. New South Wales, Australia recorded 3 new cases. Three new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the state of New South Wales, the state health department reported in a statement, bringing the total number of cases in NSW to 3,177.Two of the cases are travellers in hotel quarantine, and the third case is an overseas cargo airline crew member. The crew member\u2019s close contacts have been identified, the statement notes, and \u201cfurther investigations are underway.\u201d Western Australia confirmed 1 new case. The state of Western Australia has confirmed 1 new case of coronavirus, the health department announced on Sunday, to bring the state total to 609. The case is a traveller in hotel quarantine. Queensland, Australia recorded zero new cases. Queensland recorded no new coronavirus cases overnight but the government will wait until Tuesday to announce any easing of restrictions. Queenslanders will have to wait 48 hours to know when and how Covid-19 restrictions will be lifted after the transport minister stonewalled questions about borders reopening. The pandemic has now entered a new phase, with India and Brazil battling outbreaks of over 10,000 cases a day, putting a major strain on resources, Reuters reports. The two countries accounted for over a third of all new cases in the past week. Brazil reported a record 54,700 new cases on 19 June. Some researchers said the death toll in Latin America could rise to over 380,000 by October, from around 100,000 this week. The total number of cases continued to increase at a rate of between 1-2% a day in the past week, down from rates above 10% in March. Countries including China, New Zealand and Australia have seen new outbreaks in the past month, despite largely quashing local transmission. In Beijing, where hundreds of new cases were linked to an agricultural market, testing capacity has been ramped up to 300,000 a day. The United States, which has reported the most cases of any country at more than 2.5 million, managed to slow the spread of the virus in May, only to see it expand in recent weeks to rural areas and other places that were previously unaffected. In some countries with limited testing capabilities, case numbers reflect a small proportion of total infections. Roughly half of reported infections are known to have recovered. As global cases near 10 million, with 9,955,495 currently confirmed, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, which relies on official government data, some countries are experiencing a resurgence in infections, leading authorities to partially reinstate lockdowns, in what experts say could be a recurring pattern in the coming months and into 2021, Reuters reports. North America, Latin America and Europe each account for around 25% of cases, while Asia and the Middle East have around 11% and 9% respectively, according to the Reuters tally, which uses government reports. There have been 498,217 fatalities linked to the disease so far, roughly the same as the number of influenza deaths reported annually. A review of New Zealand\u2019s managed isolation and quarantine facilities has found that the system is under \u201cextreme stress\u201d as more and more Kiwis return home. It came as four more returnees tested positive to Covid-19 in the biggest one-day jump in cases in two months. The review found \u201cresources required to support the managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) function have failed to keep pace with the increased volume of returnees\u201d. \u201cThe team found that the system, whilst not broken, is under extreme stress and is not readily able to respond to the increasing demands being placed upon it,\u201d the review found. \u201cThis has resulted in a very dedicated team having to confront immediate issues with limited capacity to plan ahead,\u201d the review said, adding that this was \u201cimpacting on staff wellbeing and the confidence that returnees have in the process\u201d. Announcing the results of the review, New Zealand\u2019s housing minister, Megan Wood, said: \u201cWhile the system was manageable under level-4 (restrictions), when there was only small numbers of New Zealanders returning home, it is now a system under stress, with arrivals increasing by 73% last week, compared to the beginning of April.\u201d Get in touch on Twitter or via email: questions, comments, feedback, tips and news from your part of Australia and the world are all welcome.

Queensland recorded no new coronavirus cases overnight but the government will wait until Tuesday to announce any easing of restrictions, AAP reports. Queenslanders will have to wait 48 hours to know when and how Covid-19 restrictions will be lifted after the transport minister stonewalled questions about borders reopening. Mark Bailey says premier Annastacia Palaszczuk will announce any changes on Tuesday and those decisions will be rooted in \u201cevidence\u201d and on the back of medical advice. Queensland recorded no new cases overnight and has had just one positive test - a returned traveller from overseas - in the past eight days. \u201cBorder provisions have been key to us, achieving that outcome, an outcome that New South Wales and Victoria haven\u2019t been able to achieve,\u201d he said on Sunday. \u2018Real vulnerability\u2019: Qantas job cuts show Covid-19 will change the future of work As he surveyed the economic wreckage from 6,000 Qantas job cuts this week, the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, expressed the glass-half-full hope that there would be other openings for redundant workers as the sector rebounds. He quickly added that it would nevertheless be \u201cvery, very difficult\u201d for those workers, and in doing so betrayed the size of the problem facing Australia as it grapples with the recessionary fallout from the coronavirus crisis that experts think could ripple through the economy for years. While the first couple of months of the crisis saw thousands of workers laid off, there was a McCormack-esque expectation that this was a temporary glitch and that, as government support kicked in, most people would make it through the worst and would be back at work soon enough. A litany of job losses at bluechip companies in the past week show that the damage could be more permanent. Qantas, a flag-carrying totem of Australian enterprise, was just the most visible casualty with its shedding of one-fifth of its employees while keeping another 15,000 stood down. Other big names to feel the pinch were the accountancy giants Deloitte and PwC, which said they would be cutting 700 and 400 positions respectively. The ABC is reducing its workforce by 250 and journalists are also being sacrificed at News Corp. The Qantas boss Alan Joyce\u2019s prediction that international flights would not resume for another 12 months was a particularly ominous warning for Australia, whose outward-looking economy relies heavily on tourism and overseas students. Horticulturalists across South Australia are now able to apply for grants of up to $300,000 to install new or replace damaged produce netting, AAP reports. The $14.6 million Horticultural Netting Infrastructure Program will help farmers protect crops from extreme weather and pests, and forms another part of SA\u2019s post-virus economic recovery. Senator for South Australia Anne Ruston said the program will be essential to help protect the state\u2019s world-famous produce. \u201cWe have one of the best agricultural sectors in the world, some would say the best,\u201d she said. \u201cBy supporting our farmers and horticulturalists the Commonwealth is very hopeful we will be able to drive our economy forward as restrictions lift and and as we are able to keep exporting our products.\u201d The scheme will commence from 29 June 2020 and operate until 30 June 2023, or until funds are fully committed, according to state government. Minister for Primary Industries and Regional Development Tim Whetstone said the program is estimated to net almost 500 hectares which will have a significant impact on the future of horticulture in South Australia. \u201cNetting is a gamechanger for horticultural producers by providing protection from the elements - sun, wind and hail - not to mention bats and birds,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring drought conditions and high water prices, netting also delivers a dramatic improvement in water efficiency and has shown it can increase yields. The program will be backdated for eligible producers who have installed netting since December 2019. South Korea South Korea has confirmed 62 additional cases of the coronavirus over a 24-hour period as the Asian country continues to face new clusters of infections amid eased social distancing rules. The additional cases reported Sunday took the country\u2019s total to 12,715, with 282 deaths. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 40 of the newly reported cases were domestically infected, while the other 22 came from overseas. It says 26 of the 40 domestic cases were detected in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area. South Korea has been struggling to suppress a spike in new cases since it eased up on its rigid social distancing rules in early May. Those new cases have been linked to nightclubs, church services, a huge e-commerce warehouse and low-income workers. The Australian government insists it is focused on the next phase of \u201cshort-term measures\u201d to support people through the coronavirus pandemic amid reports it is considering a permanent $75 per week lift in unemployment benefits. The government has been coming under increasing pressure over the drop-off in economic supports due in September, with the Qantas announcement last week of a further 6,000 job cuts adding to expectations of extended economic pain. With a week to run before the Eden-Monaro byelection, and amid growing focus on the looming \u201ccliff\u201d in support measures, senior ministers have reportedly told News Corp\u2019s Sunday tabloids a $75 weekly rise in the jobseeker allowance base rate was \u201cthe preferred option\u201d for changes after the pandemic. The British government is considering imposing a lockdown in the city of Leicester after a surge of coronavirus cases there, the Sunday Times newspaper reported, citing senior government sources. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is examining a legislation required for the shutdown after it was disclosed that Leicester, a city of around 350,000 people in the East Midlands, has had over 650 Covid-19 cases in the fortnight to June 16, the newspaper reported. Hancock is considering \u201call options\u201d, including imposing a localised lockdown, according to the report. Mainland China on Sunday reported 17 new coronavirus cases, mostly in the Chinese capital of Beijing. The National Health Commission said 17 new infections were confirmed on Saturday, down from 21 a day earlier. In Beijing, 14 new confirmed cases were reported, down from 17 a day earlier. Since June 11 when Beijing reported its first case in the current outbreak, stemming from a sprawling wholesale food centre in the southwest of the capital, 311 people in the city of more than 20 million have contracted the virus, Reuters reports. Mainland China reported three new so-called imported cases on Friday, infections linked to travellers arriving from abroad. That compares with four cases a day earlier. That took the cumulative number of confirmed cases in mainland China to 83,500. Mainland China reported seven new asymptomatic patients, who tested positive for Covis-19 but showed no clinical symptoms such as a fever, down from 12 a day earlier. The national health authority does not include asymptomatic patients in its tally of confirmed cases. The death toll stood at 4,634, unchanged since mid-May. Coronavirus in Victoria: Daniel Andrews considers suburban lockdowns as 49 new cases confirmed The full story on the latest from Victoria, Australia now: The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, says the state will consider potential stay-at-home orders and suburban lockdowns to contain several coronavirus clusters in Melbourne, after another 49 cases of coronavirus were detected on Saturday. Victoria is conducting a testing blitz in an attempt to prevent further spread of the virus. About 40,000 people have been tested since Friday. \u201cMuch like a bushfire, putting this out is challenging,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cContaining it, though, is something that we can do, and [widespread testing and contact tracing] is the most effective thing to do. \u201cThe challenge here is [that] we have to test in those hotspots, but at the same time, we can\u2019t take our eye off any other part of the state. We have to keep those testing numbers up to a satisfactory level so that in trying to track and trace one problem, we aren\u2019t necessarily unaware of any other problem that we might have.\u201d On a potential return to lockdowns or other restrictions, Andrews said: \u201cno one wants to go back to that unless we absolutely have to\u201d. Overnight, Victoria updated its public health directives in an attempt to address concern that some people in mandatory hotel quarantine, after returning from overseas, had refused coronavirus tests and subsequently been allowed into the community.

The rise of disinformation during coronavirus \u2013 Australian politics live podcast Katharine Murphy speaks with Jack Wallace and Tom Uren, analysts from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, about their recent investigation into online disinformation, and China\u2019s increasing employment of it since the outbreak of Covid-19. What are the differences between disinformation peddled by China and the US governments, and what role has it played in Australian politics? The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Saturday reported 44,602 new coronavirus cases and said the number of deaths had risen by 651 to 124,976, Reuters reports. The CDC reported its tally of cases as of 4pm ET on 26 June versus its previous report a day earlier. According to Johns Hopkins University data, the number of cases in the US stands at 2,507,874. There have been 125,504 deaths. The state of Western Australia has confirmed 1 new case of coronavirus, the health department announced on Sunday, to bring the state total to 609. The case is a traveller in hotel quarantine: There are five active cases in WA \u2013 all are in hotel quarantine. A total of 595 people have recovered from Covid-19 in WA. Yesterday 339 people presented to WA Covid-19 clinics \u2013 331 were assessed and 329 were swabbed. Visit WA Health\u2019s HealthyWA website for the latest information on Covid-19. Three new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the state of New South Wales, the state health department reported in a statement, bringing the total number of cases in NSW to 3,177. Two of the cases are travellers in hotel quarantine, and the third case is an overseas cargo airline crew member. The crew member\u2019s close contacts have been identified, the statement notes, and \u201cfurther investigations are underway.\u201d In terms of testing: A record total of 18,114 tests were notified in the reporting period [of between 8pm on 26 June and 8pm on 27 June] compared with 23,733 tests in the previous 24 hours. More than 830,000 Covid-19 tests have now been carried out in NSW. There are currently 49 Covid-19 cases being treated by NSW Health, with none in intensive care. In NSW, 2,784 people are known to have recovered from Covid-19. Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Saturday reported 4,410 new confirmed coronavirus infections and 602 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 212,802 cases and 26,381 deaths. The government has said the real number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the confirmed cases. The US coronavirus death toll passed 125,000 on Saturday, as cases topped 2,505,590. The US has the highest known cases and deaths worldwide, and is almost 1.2 million cases ahead of Brazil, which has the next-highest number of infections. New York Times chief White House correspondent Peter Baker noted on Twitter that more Americans have died than in the Vietnam War since US President Donald Trump stopped his daily coronavirus task force briefings at the White House: In Australia, Labor education spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek has described the Morrison government\u2019s plan to change university studies as a \u201cdog\u2019s breakfast\u201d, AAP reports. Federal Education Minister Dan Tehan announced earlier this month that the cost of certain courses like humanities would double with the intent to steer students towards degrees like maths and teaching. The government believes this will increase a student\u2019s chance of getting a job when they leave university and help boost the economy on the road back from the coronavirus pandemic. Ms Plibersek believes the only thing the government has done is made it harder for people to get into university and more expensive if they are successful. And she said while the government wants people to go to TAFE for their training, it has cut TAFE funding by $3 billion and the number of apprentices is falling by 2000 places a week. \u201cIt\u2019s just a dog\u2019s breakfast,\u201d she told Sky New\u2019s Sunday Agenda program. \u201cThe universities are beside themselves, they can\u2019t work out why the government \u2018s gone down this path because it is doing the exact opposite of what they\u2019ve said they want to do.\u201d Last week Mr Tehan announced an integrity unit to ensure universities maintain a high level of quality. Ms Plibersek scoffed at the idea, calling it \u201cnuts\u201d. \u201cWhy not get the system right first,\u201d she said. The Morrison government has denied it about to permanently lift unemployment benefit payments when the treasurer makes a long-awaited economic statement next month. News Corp newspapers, citing senior ministers, had reported the jobseeker payment would rise to $75 per day from $40 when the present enhanced version of the unemployment payment ends in September. \u201cThere are no such proposals before the government or under consideration for the economic statement next month,\u201d a spokesperson for social services minister Anne Ruston told Australian Associated Press. \u201cThe government is focused on the next phase of short-term measures designed to address the Covid-19 crisis.\u201d The jobseeker payment, formerly known as Newstart, was doubled to around $1,100 a fortnight as a support measure during the pandemic. Treasury has been reviewing both jobseeker and the jobkeeper wage subsidy. Senior Labor frontbencher Tanya Plibersek said people who had been forced on to the dole because of the coronavirus pandemic were in for a shock if the jobseeker payment returned to its pre-crisis rate of $40 per a day. \u201cIt is an inadequate payment, it doesn\u2019t allow people to live with dignity,\u201d she told Sky News\u2019 Sunday Agenda program. \u201cWe now have hundreds of thousands of extra people joining the dole queue, people who have been working full time until very recently that would very much struggle if what\u2019s now called jobseeker went back to the old Newstart rate.\u201d The coalition government has long argued against raising the unemployment payment, which hasn\u2019t been increased for 25 years apart from indexation increases. There is widespread support for an increase from Labor, the Greens, welfare groups, business organisations like the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Industry Group, economists and the Reserve Bank. The novel coronavirus, now spreading through the smaller towns of Brazil\u2019s interior, risks returning to major cities in a so-called \u201cboomerang effect,\u201d as a lack of specialised medical treatment forces patients into larger urban centres, Reuters reports. The impact of a potential second wave of new cases in urban centres could complicate attempts to reopen businesses and get the economy going again, experts said. \u201cThe boomerang of cases that will return to the (state) capitals will be a tsunami,\u201d said Miguel Nicolelis, a leading medical neuroscientist at Duke University who is coordinating a coronavirus task force advising the state governments of Brazil\u2019s northeast. Brazil, home to the world\u2019s second worst coronavirus outbreak behind the United States, has over 1.2 million cases of the virus, which has killed nearly 55,000 people. On most days, it is spreading faster in Brazil than in the United States, the top country by cases. After months of strict Covid-19 lockdowns and resolutely closed borders, Fiji is open \u2013 for billionaires. The prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, has announced the country is looking to attract \u201cVIPs\u201d to help restore Fiji\u2019s paralysed tourism-dependent economy. \u201cSo, say you\u2019re a billionaire looking to fly your own jet, rent your own island, and invest millions of dollars in Fiji in the process. If you\u2019ve taken all the necessary health precautions and borne all associated costs, you may have a new home to escape the pandemic in paradise,\u201d the prime minister said in a remarkably frank tweet. Bainimarama said the country would also welcome travellers arriving by yacht who were prepared to spend 14 days at sea \u2013 or make up the balance in quarantine in Fiji. The country\u2019s attorney general, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, has announced the first planeload of 30 \u201chigh-net-worth individuals\u2026 from a very well-known company\u201d were set to arrive by private plane in the archipelago nation on Sunday. \u201cWe already have one group coming,\u201d Sayed-Khaiyum said during a national budget consultation. \u201cWe just did the approval ... for the flight to come in, and they\u2019ll be spending three months here. There\u2019s about 30 of them, and a very well-known company they are coming from. Video has emerged of Trump campaign volunteers apparently removing social distancing stickers from seats in the arena where the US president gave a campaign rally that many public health experts had warned against because of the still-surging coronavirus pandemic. The Washington Post published the video, which it says shows Trump campaign workers methodically removing the stickers from seats at the BOK Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The labels read \u201cDo Not Sit Here, Please!\u201d and had been placed there by the venue in order to minimize the risk of Covid-19 infection. In Australia, the Herald Sun reports this morning that roadblocks and checkpoints are being considered by Victorian authorities, should coronavirus continue to spread from multiple suburban clusters. Victoria has a number of suburbs where authorities have recorded high rates of community transmission.
