Leaving aside the fact that the analogy is manifestly unjust to the wondrous state of our nation's railways in the 21st century, if the minister means in some way to imply that the birth of the ID card will also be attended by dodgy parliamentary dealings, catastrophic technological failures and frequent financial disaster, we can't help feeling he's some way wide of the mark. Poor show! \u00b7 Now this cannot be a coincidence. The following two emails landed in our inbox yesterday, within an hour of each other. \"A pair of squirrels,\" writes alert reader Matthew Minter of Castle Cary, Somerset, \"have gnawed through the hoses which bring bottled gas into my house. Substance abuse - or an attempt to cause an explosion?\" On the other side of the planet, alert reader Paul Gallacher's Australian friends \"have been left shocked and upset after a squirrel chewed through and removed the fitting between the gas cylinder and their barbecue. They know who the culprit is, as they had spotted it hanging around the garden looking devious\". We bet they had. Be careful how you go out there, folks. \u00b7 Meanwhile, it looks as if Anthony Steen MP (Totnes, Con) is on to something. \"To ask the secretary of state for culture, media and sport,\" he inquires, \"how many (a) sporting, (b) aero-modelling, (c) bowling and (d) model flying clubs have opted out of accepting anyone under the age of 18 years old as a member in the last two years, and how many instructors at model flying clubs have ceased to instruct children in the last two years.\" Are we raising a generation of kamikaze kids? The truth must be told. \u00b7 We're relieved to see no one else managed to get anything remotely resembling a story out of Julian Barnes, Martin Amis, Ian McEwan, Melvyn Bragg, John Mortimer, Kathy Lette, Jonathan Dimbleby, Piers Morgan, Andrew Marr, Jack Straw, George Osborne, Maurice Saatchi, Tim Rice, Tony Benn (who?) or any of the other guests at the refreshingly low-key launch of dear Tina Brown's Diana Chronicles on Monday night. Rachel Johnson, sister of the more famous (but certainly no more talented) Boris, did tell us she'd been deluged with anxious emails ordering her to make sure her brother showed up, which was quite funny, but we couldn't stay to find out if he did. We hate these things. There's never anyone to talk to. \u00b7 Hats off to Gavin Esler, though, who on Monday night announced to bemused Newsnight viewers the death of controversial comedian Bernard Matthews, before apologising five minutes later with the words: \"Well, the script said Matthews.\" Such grace! \u00b7 According to the BBC's rip-roaring report on how to be impartial, the \"alchemy\" that goes into a show should, and we quote, \"produce not a solid (too rigid), nor a liquid (too fluid), but an odourless gas (harmless, of course) which will infuse the programme-making environment and be healthily breathed by those who work there.\" An odourless and harmless gas, eh. That sounds promising. \u00b7 In Gary, Indiana, reports the NWI Times, one Richard Brewer, on being told the shoe shop he was in did not stock the slippers he wanted, declared he was God and \"when God speaks, you're supposed to give him everything\". Last month in the same town, a 21-year-old man walked into a branch of Chase Bank and tried to cash a $50,000 cheque signed \"King of Kings, Lord of Lords, Saviour\". Weird. \u00b7 Asked in July's Record Collector mag what gets him dancing, Rick Wakeman, legendary Yes keyboard wizard and Grumpy Old Man, admits: \"Nothing. I have as much natural rhythm as a stagnant dog turd.\" Who'd have thought it? diary@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
