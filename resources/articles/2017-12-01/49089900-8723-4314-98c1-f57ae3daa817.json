A friend from their days at Oxford University together, Green had been one of her closest allies in cabinet. The 61-year-old was investigated by the Cabinet Office after he was accused of inappropriate behaviour towards a young Conservative activist, Kate Maltby. Separately, two former senior Scotland Yard officers claimed that pornography was found on his computer when he was in opposition. The discovery was made in 2008 when Green was shadow immigration minister as part of Operation Miser, an investigation into Home Office leaks. Green had strenuously denied both inappropriate behaviour towards Maltby and accessing pornography on his work computer. He now admits that his lawyer discussed the pornography with police in 2008 and 2013, and he has also apologised to Maltby for any distress caused. Kate Maltby The 31-year-old Conservative activist and journalist wrote an article for the Times claiming Green had touched her knee in 2015 and, one year later, sent her a suggestive message. Maltby, a family friend of Green, said that when she met him in a pub in Waterloo, he suggested he could help her start a political career. Green mentioned that his own wife was \u201cvery understanding\u201d, Maltby claimed and she then \u201cfelt a fleeting hand against my knee \u2013 so brief it was almost deniable\u201d. Angered by the incident, Maltby said she had no further contact with Green until he sent her a text message a year later saying he had \u201cadmired [her] in a corset\u201d and inviting her for a drink. Sue Gray The head of propriety and ethics at the Cabinet Office led the inquiry into allegations against Green, which was launched on 1 November. Gray has been described as one of the most powerful people in the country. In his memoir, David Laws, a Liberal Democrat member of the coalition cabinet, said: \u201cUnless she agrees, things just don\u2019t happen. Cabinet reshuffles, departmental reorganisations, the whole lot \u2013 it\u2019s all down to Sue Gray. Our poor, deluded voters think the prime minister holds the reins of power. Wrong! The truth is our real leader, Sue Gray, sits at a small desk in the Cabinet Office.\u201d Gray\u2019s inquiry was told about pornography being found on Green\u2019s computer, but Whitehall sources denied that Green\u2019s computer records were being examined as part of the process. Sir Paul Stephenson The Metropolitan police commissioner between 2009 and 2011 when the Home Office leak inquiry was conducted. He confirmed he was briefed about the pornography on Green\u2019s computer but regarded it as a \u201cside issue\u201d. He said he regretted that its existence was in the public domain. Speaking to the BBC, Stephenson said it was not Scotland Yard\u2019s role to \u201cpolice the workplace\u201d. He was interviewed as part of Gray\u2019s inquiry. Bob Quick As former Met assistant commissioner, Quick led Operation Miser, the police inquiry into Home Office leaks. He told the Sunday Times that \u201cextreme\u201d pornographic material was found on one of Green\u2019s Commons computers when the MP was shadow immigration minister. Quick has also given evidence to Gray\u2019s inquiry. Green initially dismissed Quick\u2019s claims and suggested they were biased. The MP said: \u201cI can only assume that they are being made now, nine years later, for ulterior motives.\u201d But he has now admitted that his lawyers discussed the pornography with police in 2008 and 2013. Neil Lewis A former Scotland Yard detective who specialised in examining digital devices for evidence. He told the BBC that thousands of thumbnail images of legal pornography had been found on Green\u2019s computer. \u201cThe shocking thing as I was viewing it, I noticed a lot of pornography \u2013 thumbnails, which indicated web browsing,\u201d he said. Lewis said he was motivated to come forward when he heard Green denying claims by his superior Quick. \u201cHis outright denial of that was quite amazing followed by his criticism of Bob Quick,\u201d Lewis said. Lewis faces an investigation by the Met\u2019s professional standards department into his decision to go public about Green."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
