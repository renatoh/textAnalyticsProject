But in the battle against coronavirus, Daniel Ortega has been invisible, sparking wild speculation over whether Nicaragua\u2019s septuagenarian leader is self-isolating, bed-bound in hospital \u2013 or might even have died. It has been almost a month since the 74-year-old leftist was last seen in public \u2013 and with the political rumour-mill in overdrive one prominent opponent this week gave him a deadline of 9.30am on Thursday to show his face. \u201cNicaraguans must know the truth about the reasons for his absence,\u201d tweeted \u00c1lvaro Leiva S\u00e1nchez, a human rights activist forced into exile by the brutal political crackdown that followed the failed 2018 uprising against Ortega and left more than 300 dead. Nicaragua\u2019s president was last seen on 12 March when he dialled into a conference call to discuss coronavirus with fellow Central American leaders, although Leiva claimed he had not been seen out and about since 21 February. The former rebel\u2019s retreat has caused anger and confusion at a time when Central America\u2019s largest country is facing a pandemic that has claimed more than 80,000 lives worldwide. \u201cAnalysts fear that behind his prolonged disappearance lies a macabre plan,\u201d a conspiratorial article in the opposition newspaper La Prensa declared this week. F\u00e9lix Maradiaga, a prominent opposition activist, said it was possible Ortega \u2013 who has ruled Nicaragua since 2007 \u2013 was suffering a genuine health problem. But Maradiaga said Ortega had pulled vanishing acts before as part of a \u201cmedia strategy\u201d designed \u201cto strengthen the cult of personality around him\u201d. Ortega\u2019s tendency to slip off the map has fuelled longstanding rumours over the state of his health and earned him the nickname \u201cel gobernante ausente\u201d (the absent ruler) in the Nicaraguan press. In Ortega\u2019s absence Nicaragua\u2019s coronavirus response has been publicly steered by his vice-president and wife, Rosario Murillo, an eccentric and widely reviled poet who many see as the country\u2019s real ruler. That response has been deeply controversial: Nicaragua\u2019s government has declined to close the country\u2019s schools, shops or borders and even sponsored large-scale political rallies including a recent march through Managua called \u201cLove in a Time of Covid-19\u201d. While much of Latin America is in a state or partial or total shutdown, Nicaraguan government propaganda websites continue to promote food festivals, beauty pageants and even the use of outdoor paddling pools. The health ministry insists there has been no community transmission and has recorded only a handful cases of infection and one death \u2013 although many doubt those claims. But on Tuesday the Pan American Health Organization publicly questioned Nicaragua\u2019s response. \u201cWe have concerns for the lack of social distancing, the convening of mass gatherings. We have concerns about the testing, contact tracing, the reporting of cases. We also have concerns about what we see as inadequate infection prevention and control,\u201d said Carissa Etienne, its Dominican director. Nicaragua\u2019s posture has drawn unflattering comparisons to Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has faced global condemnation for dismissing coronavirus as a media \u201ctrick\u201d \u2013 even though it has already killed 667 Brazilians. \u201cBolsonaro is putting the health of Brazil\u2019s people at risk,\u201d the Brazilian correspondent Sylvia Colombo wrote this week in an article comparing the Brazilian and Nicaraguan responses. \u201cBut in other parts of the world mankind manages to be even worse \u2026 It\u2019s as if [Nicaragua\u2019s] regime actually wanted to rid itself of part of the population,\u201d Colombo wrote. Carlos Quant Dur\u00e1n, one of Nicaragua\u2019s top specialists in infectious diseases, said Ortega\u2019s government had failed to take proper containment measures before coronavirus entered the country and was now failing to stop its spread. \u201cThe state is obliged to try and reduce the risk of contagion: to avoid holding mass events, to close places where lots of people gather, like schools and universities. But the government has failed to do this,\u201d Quant Dur\u00e1n said. The sociologist Elvira Cuadra branded Nicaragua\u2019s strategy \u201cirresponsible and criminal\u201d. Nicaragua\u2019s government has made no official comment on Ortega\u2019s whereabouts but in daily broadcasts Murillo has insisted he continues to lead the country and sends \u201caffectionate hugs\u201d to the Nicaraguan people. Maradiaga claimed the former revolutionary hero had become so detached from the people he claimed to represent that, in some ways, his absence hardly mattered at all. \u201cHe\u2019s been in a state of permanent quarantine for years, showing interest in nothing but himself and those around him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
