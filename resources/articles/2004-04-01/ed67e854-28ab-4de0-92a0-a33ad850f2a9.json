Many skiers booked their 2005 trip as soon as they returned from this year's holiday after experiencing record snow depths in resorts such as St Anton in Austria, where a whopping four metres piled up. Ski operators claim that more people than ever are taking advantage of 'early bird' booking discounts. Next Easter is predicted to be more popular than ever because it will fall early on 27 March and so is more likely to have great snow. 'It's been a very good snow year all over Europe, snow has fallen with more regularity giving a better base and better conditions than in previous years. The late season has been excellent,' said a spokesman for the Ski Club of Great Britain. Esprit launched its first preview brochure with special offers last month to take advantage of the growing trend to book early. It normally waits until May to release its first brochure, but the move has paid off, so far bookings are double those of last year. Austria was especially popular following its excellent snowfall, said a spokesman. Families who are restricted to skiing in the school holidays and people with special requirements such as large groups wanting private chalets are proving to be those most likely to book early. There was debate in the industry over how popular America would be next year. Esprit predicted it would be 'the big loser', because this year's great European snow would convince people it was unnecessary to trek around the world in search of powder when they could reach the Alps in under two hours, avoiding long flights and jet lag. An Erna Low spokeswoman said it would depend on the strength of the dollar. Neilson has added extra trips to Norway and Bulgaria and predicted more people than ever would choose them, as well as Romania, lured by the low costs. The alternative activities such as snowmobiling and reindeer-spotting in Norway would make it increasingly popular with families. A further trend spotted by Neilson was that people are becoming less concerned with apr\u00e8s-ski and more focused on their skiing, accordingly the company had exchanged its traditional welcome meeting for 'snow briefings' to tell guests where to find the best runs and snow in the resort.
