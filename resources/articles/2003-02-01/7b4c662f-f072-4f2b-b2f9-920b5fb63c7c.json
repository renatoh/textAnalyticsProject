I just have to carry on working and hope for good results against Liechtenstein and Turkey.\" \u00b7 Fulham are to appeal against a Fifa ruling that they must pay the final \u00a32.5m instalment of Steve Marlet's fee to Lyon within 30 days or face sanctions, probably in the form of a transfer embargo. World football's governing body decided that Fulham had not provided a \"plausible explanation\" for withholding the last tranche of Marlet's \u00a311.5m fee. But the Premiership club have 20 days to contest the verdict and confirmed: \"We are going to appeal.\" That appeal will be heard by Fifa's executive committee and Fulham would most likely be happy to see it take place after their legal action against the agents involved in the Marlet transfer is completed. Fulham are going to the high court to try to recover the commission they have paid the agents, Pascal and S\u00e9bastien Boisseau, and evidence heard there could strengthen the club's hand in their appeal. Fulham, who claim the agents acted against Fifa rules and Marlet's price was artificially inflated, have provided extensive documentation to Fifa. The FA has banned Reading's John Mackie for three matches, with a further five-game ban suspended until the end of next season, after he admitted racially abusing Sheffield United's Carl Asaba."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
