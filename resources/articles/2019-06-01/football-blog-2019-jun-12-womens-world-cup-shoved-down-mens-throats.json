Most specifically, the men who are not watching it. We hear so much about the tournament itself. Too much, it is argued \u2013 and at the expense of one of the four great civil rights questions of our era: 1) When are we getting a White History Month? 2) When is International Men\u2019s Day? 3) Isn\u2019t it time we had Straight Pride? and 4) Can you imagine how sexist people would say it was if we had a men\u2019s World Cup? I could not agree more with the gentlemen who dare to ask these questions \u2013 and not just so that I can buy time while I frantically locate the exit. Indeed, as part of this column\u2019s tireless commitment to celebrating the underdogs, this week let\u2019s redress the dangerous cosmic imbalance caused by the Women\u2019s World Cup. Here follows a celebration of all the different guys who currently need to explain to you \u2013 at length \u2013 why they aren\u2019t watching it. As always, you don\u2019t have to be a woman to have met some of these men over the past week. But it certainly helps! Mr Stop Shoving It Down My Throat Listen, this guy is absolutely fine with this tournament existing, being alive, whatever. He\u2019s open-minded \u2013 it\u2019s not the dark ages any more. Nothing against it. What he objects to \u2013 and he\u2019d like you to know that you\u2019ll find a lot of other perfectly decent people like him \u2013 is it being \u201cshoved down his throat\u201d. Yes, it\u2019s the shoving. Down the throat. It\u2019s like: fine. I\u2019m happy for you to do your football in the privacy of your own wherever, but please: have some sensitivity and realise that not all people are like you. So basically just don\u2019t do it in front of him, or involve him. Seriously: don\u2019t involve him. Also don\u2019t do it near his kids, especially the girl. For reference, ways that it can be shoved down his throat include \u201cbeing on TV\u201d and \u201cbeing on a website he normally looks at\u201d, for instance that of the British Broadcasting Corporation, which, by covering a sport that averaged 4.6 million viewers on Sunday night for England\u2019s game against Scotland, is pursuing a right-on agenda. Actually, let\u2019s be real for a minute: no one wants to see this. Put it away. Mr I\u2019m Being Branded Sexist This guy is fairly sure he\u2019s being \u201cbranded sexist\u201d for not watching the Women\u2019s World Cup. I think if you need to ask \u201cby who, specifically?\u201d then in a very strong but also abstract sense you\u2019re part of the problem. He is definitely getting this definite feeling that he is being made to feel sexist. It\u2019s all part of an agenda. No, he\u2019d rather not continue this conversation. He can\u2019t win, because you just can\u2019t say anything these days. Mr Inferior Product Nothing but respect for the guy who declares \u201cthe game\u2019s gone\u201d about every tiny piece of commercialisation in men\u2019s football, but falls over himself to describe the women\u2019s game as \u201can inferior product\u201d. I mean, on the one hand, a reminder: if you refer to football as either \u201cproduct\u201d or \u201ccontent\u201d \u2013 ever \u2013 you are an endless wanker. No exceptions. But on the other: I\u2019m sure it felt like an interesting point when you made it. Your points are not inferior products: keep producing them to surplus. Mr I Prefer Parks No one more than me wants to help the guy whose chief point about the 2019 World Cup is: \u201cI would so much rather watch parks football on a Sunday morning.\u201d I would also rather he did this. Mr Stop Telling Me It\u2019s Massive When It\u2019s Really Not Totally. But dude: read that one over and then probably just delete it. I know you\u2019d hate for anyone to take it out of context. And that\u2019s what they do; they take things out of context and then they twist what you say. Mr I Always Support England Always supports England, no matter what. No one loves his country more than him. But this isn\u2019t \u201cEngland\u201d by any reasonable yardstick. Which bit of England do they represent then? Not a bit he recognises. Mr Have Fifa Got A Point I love this guy, who has spent years \u2013 decades \u2013 scoffing that Fifa are a bunch of incompetent chisellers who leech money out of the game, and do less than the bare minimum to grow it while lining their own pockets. Unbelievable that they don\u2019t pay local taxes and have a cash surplus of $2.7bn when they should be a force for good. But this chap looks at the fact that the men\u2019s World Cup prize fund is $400m, that the women\u2019s is $30m. He knows he can\u2019t fall back on viewing figure ratios, given that the men\u2019s gets four times the viewers of the women\u2019s, but 13 times the prize money. And he knows the gap between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s prize fund has actually risen over the past four years. Even so, and for reasons he can\u2019t quite put his finger on: haven\u2019t Fifa got a point in just this one case? Oh, just to be clear, that\u2019s a rhetorical question. Which means you don\u2019t get to answer it. Mr I\u2019m Just Not Watching Short of hearing what other people dreamed about last night, hearing which things other people aren\u2019t watching on television is even better. Have you never seen an episode of Game of Thrones? Do you dislike Love Island? Are you not watching the Women\u2019s World Cup? If so, this is massive. Make sure to tell as many people as possible today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
