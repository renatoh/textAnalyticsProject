Published by its enterprise and lifelong learning committee, the report makes key recommendations, including plans to combine higher and further education funding to create one tertiary sector system. Other recommendations include providing financial support to part-time, low-income learners, and conducting further research into the potential of \"business learning accounts\" to encourage workplace training. The report's main focus is on entitlement and looking at ways to widen access to post-18 learning, be it in the workplace, at university or in local colleges. Alex Neil, MSP and convener of the enterprise committee, which overseas further and higher education in Scotland, said: \"We need to encourage more middle-aged people back into training to fill the skills shortage. And we need more fairness in the education system... The fact that 40% of our HE students come from FE means that linkages on the ground are stronger and the funding streams should reflect that.\" About 80% of university entrants in Scotland come from professional backgrounds, while only 14% come from unskilled households. He said the committee was aiming to create a \"culture of lifelong learning\" to address the skills shortage and the unplugged talent. \"We should create a culture of lifelong learning, so that once you're out of school or university that's not it forever - you will be able to continue learning at a later date. We want the 50% who don't go to university to have access to more training.\" Further recommendations include plans for a business learning account initiative, the equivalent of the beleaguered individual learning account, which would give companies an agreed amount of money for investment, which the Parliament would meet pound for pound. Rami Okasha, president of the National Union of Students in Scotland, said he was \"delighted\" the report demonstrated a clear commitment for a single tertiary education system. \"However, students across Scotland will be disappointed by the absence of support for a Scottish ombudsman for further and higher education, a feature NUS Scotland believes is sadly lacking from the current system. We are also concerned that the report only maintains, rather than increases, access to postgraduate learning, which is currently a very expensive option.\" Ministers are due to debate the report's findings on November 27."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
