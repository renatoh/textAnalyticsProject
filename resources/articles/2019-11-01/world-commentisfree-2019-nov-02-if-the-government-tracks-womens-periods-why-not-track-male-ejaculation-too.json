Missouri is keeping binders full of women\u2019s menstrual cycles Missouri, which has a population of over 6.1 million people, has only one abortion clinic. For rightwing zealots, however, that is one too many. An administrative hearing was held this week to decide whether the state can revoke the license for Planned Parenthood\u2019s St Louis clinic; a ruling is expected in February. If the license is revoked Missouri will become the first state without a functioning abortion clinic since 1974. The Missouri hearing, which concluded on Thursday, has been a master class in gaslighting and misogyny. According to the Missouri department of health and senior services (DHSS), the reason they want to revoke the clinic\u2019s license is because they really, really care about women\u2019s health \u2013 it has absolutely nothing to do with controlling women\u2019s bodies! The DHSS\u2019s case rests on four instances of what it calls \u201cfailed abortions\u201d \u2013 cases where complications arose and the patient had to return to the clinic for another procedure. As it turns out, the DHSS is so concerned about women\u2019s health it has been keeping spreadsheets tracking the date of Planned Parenthood patients\u2019 periods, in an attempt to figure out which of them \u201chad undergone failed abortions\u201d. Let me just repeat that: American government officials are tracking the menstrual cycles of thousands of women. But, you know, it\u2019s for their own good so don\u2019t worry about it. Amazingly, we learned about the period spreadsheets because Dr Randall Williams, the director of DHSS \u2013 clearly thinking there was a nothing creepy about the affair \u2013 openly testified about them on Tuesday. Meanwhile Planned Parenthood and the doctors at the clinic had no idea these spreadsheets existed and were being used in this manner. Outrage rightly ensued. The DHSS has responded to the controversy in the most predictable and Trumpian way possible; apparently the whole thing is fake news. The health department issued a statement on Wednesday blasting \u201cirresponsible reporting\u201d that has led to \u201cfalse claims that Dr Randall Williams tracks the menstrual cycles of women seeking abortions at Planned Parenthood\u201d. The real story, according to the statement, is that \u201ca concern came up that DHSS may not be receiving complication reports for all failed surgical abortions, as required by law. Without a directive from Dr Randall Williams, regulators devised a means to efficiently investigate that concern using legally-obtained information which was required by law and which Planned Parenthood routinely submits.\u201d Honestly, I have to give a round of applause to whoever drafted that statement: it contains so much spin that it makes you dizzy just reading it. However, despite their best attempts at obfuscation the DHSS also makes clear that, yes, these spreadsheets exist. But they\u2019re completely legal so there\u2019s nothing to see here. Missouri\u2019s DHSS isn\u2019t the only government department documenting women\u2019s menstrual cycles, by the way. As Planned Parenthood noted in a statement, the spreadsheet controversy \u201cshadows the Trump administration\u2019s history of tracking the periods of refugee girls under the government\u2019s care\u201d. But again, the only reason the Trump administration has been doing this is because they want to protect these vulnerable women. You know what? Maybe I\u2019m being too cynical here. Maybe all these period spreadsheets really are just meant to protect women and keep them healthy. In that case, I think it is only right we extend the same courtesy to men. A female director of a health agency ought to keep track of when men last ejaculated and ensure they are not wasting their sperm on non-babymaking endeavours. We can call it The Ejaculist. I\u2019m sure the men of America will be touched at the government\u2019s concern for their wellbeing. Delta thinks lesbian is a dirty word The airline cut a same-sex love scene as well as the word \u201clesbian\u201d from its in-flight version of the movie Booksmart. It also reportedly censored gay references and scenes in the Elton John biopic Rocketman. This is the same Delta, by the way, that sponsored Pride parades around the world. Apparently pride runs out when you hit 30,000 feet. Katie Hill condemns \u201cdouble standard\u201d In a final speech in Congress, Hill blasted the double standards she says forced her to resign. \u201cI\u2019m leaving because of a misogynistic culture that gleefully consumed my naked pictures, capitalized on my sexuality, and enabled my abusive ex to continue that abuse, this time with the entire country watching,\u201d she said. Hill acknowledged having an affair with a staffer but noted: \u201cWe have men credibly accused of sexual assault who are in boardrooms, in the supreme court, in this very body and, worst of all, in the Oval Office.\u201d Female MPs say abuse forcing them out of politics More than 50 members of parliament have announced they will be standing down at the next general election in the UK. Eighteen of these MPs are women. \u201cMany of the MPs who have decided to stand down at the election are women who have cited the daily abuse they receive as their main reason for leaving Parliament,\u201d Labour MP Rachel Reeves tweeted. \u201cToday, death and rape threats are a daily occurrence for women MPs.\u201d Squashing the patriarchy The world\u2019s best female squash player will receive more prize money than her male counterpart for the first time ever.

A golden age of feminist thrillers If, like me, you spend way too much time reading thrillers, you may appreciate this piece from the New York Times on how a new wave of female crime novelists are \u201cpresenting women and girls who refuse the roles of passive victim, staid detective or standard-issue femme fatale\u201d. A very British brouhaha over gay giraffes Britain appears to be equal parts tragedy and farce at the moment. While not Brexiting or calling interminable elections our esteemed politicians appear to be arguing over the sexuality of long-necked mammals.
