Portuguese police sources told the Guardian that the scientists have asked to revisit some of the evidence retrieved from the holiday apartment from which the British toddler went missing on 3 May 2007. The forensic evidence gathered at the time of Madeleine\u2019s disappearance has been stored at the National Institute for Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences in Coimbra in central Portugal. Detectives and forensic technicians from the Metropolitan police are scheduled to visit the laboratory on Wednesday. Detectives led by Redwood will meet with their Pol\u00edcia Judici\u00e1ria counterparts in Faro on Tuesday to discuss the request. Police said they had not yet received any official orders from the public prosecutor\u2019s office and that the next phase of the investigation was unlikely to commence for at least a fortnight. A source close to the case told the Guardian that the request appeared \u201cto focus primarily on the further questioning of some of the suspects brought in by Faro police in the summer\u201d. In July, Portuguese police quizzed four Portuguese nationals who were declared arguidos, or formal suspects. They also spoke to 11 witnesses. The questioning of these suspects followed the end of major ground-level searches in Praia da Luz in early June, when Scotland Yard detectives scoured a large patch of scrubland. The force described the operation as the largest overseas deployment ever undertaken by British police, and said it was the \u201cfirst phase of this investigation\u201d into Madeleine\u2019s disappearance. Although the searches turned up no fresh evidence, the Met said detectives had gained an \u201cessential understanding of the activity for which people have used this piece of land\u201d and alluded to \u201csubstantial work which is yet to be done in the coming months\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
