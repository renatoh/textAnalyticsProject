The report by the Commons public administration committee (PASC) recommends a beefed-up internal procedure to dissuade civil servants from turning to the press. Looking into the circumstances surrounding the arrest last year of junior civil servant Christopher Galley for leaking information from the home office to Tory immigration spokesman Damian Green, the report concludes that, at the moment, civil servants fear their career will suffer if they followed the approved channel for whistleblowing and instead opt to make anonymous tip-offs to journalists. PASC suggests leak investigations are futile \u2013 hamstrung by the fact that many leaks are politically motivated. The MPs found many leaks took place because civil servants felt their views were not accurately reflected in the eventual policy and an encouragement of more vigorous internal policy debate should be encouraged to head that off. Tony Wright, the Labour MP and PASC chairman, said: \"It is essential civil servants know what channels are available to them if they believe there is wrongdoing or information is being suppressed.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
