Molly O\u2019Cathain, a theatre designer, was home in Dublin for a few days\u2019 break from a year working at the National Theatre in London when the shutters came down. To start with, she says, \u201cI got really bored living in my parents\u2019 house \u2013 sleeping behind the sofa \u2013 as a 27-year-old.\u201d She decided they all needed a distraction. \u201cI\u2019d seen a tweet from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, aimed at kids, asking them to re-create Old Masters with three items from their cupboards. So that was how it started.\u201d Each day since then, she has conjured a portrait that casts her mother, Liz, and father, Brian, both 60, as leads in famous paintings. They began modestly enough, dressed as the stiff homesteaders of Grant Wood\u2019s American Gothic. Since then, they have kissed like a Gustav Klimt, stared at each other in profile like the 15th-century Duke and Duchess of Urbino (\u201cBrian and Liz of Dublino\u201d) in Piero della Francesca\u2019s diptych, and, respectively, channelled Frida Kahlo and Salvador Dal\u00ed. Friday\u2019s tableau, an uncanny recreation of David Hockney\u2019s most poignant portrait, My Parents, was the most challenging yet, not least because it involved moving all the dining room furniture around. Though O\u2019Cathain originally set the challenge, her parents have become more than willing accomplices. \u201cOne day we were doing the Renaissance woman. Mum disappeared to the kitchen and came back with her face covered in flour,\u201d she says. Another time, Brian decided he was unhappy with the sword she had made so he went away and returned brandishing a superior effort made of a bit of wardrobe, a spanner and a kitchen knife. O\u2019Cathain put the first few images on Instagram for her friends, but since then pressure has grown to outdo the previous day\u2019s effort \u2013 \u201cthough it goes without saying this is entirely frivolous compared with what\u2019s going on\u201d. Brian, a geologist, and Liz, a textile artist, have both lately become students again and are doing online lectures during the day, so making pictures is restricted to the evenings. \u201cSome days we leave it a bit late, so we do what we can.\u201d There\u2019s no end in sight. One ambition is to try Van Eyck\u2019s Arnolfini portrait, but they can\u2019t find the convex mirror that her dad thinks is packed away somewhere. \u201cAlso there is a great photo of David Bowie and Tilda Swinton where they have swapped clothes that I would like to do.\u201d O\u2019Cathain thinks it is interesting how her parents\u2019 character comes through in the pictures. \u201cMy mum looks very beautiful in the Gustav Klimt Kiss we did, despite the Ikea cushion. My dad is a perfectionist and tries to get it just right, but I like that it is a bit silly and he has a saucepan for a helmet or whatever.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
