Broadcasting union Bectu said it will announce after Easter when strikes will be held, after its ITV members voted by 55% in favour of walkouts in protest at a below inflation pay offer of 3.3%. Gerry Morrissey, the union's assistant general secretary, said: \"It is unacceptable that ITV executives award themselves huge share bonuses but will not give their workers a pay rise in line with inflation.\" The dispute involves several hundred broadcasting, production and studio staff at ITV centres in London, Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool, Norwich, Birmingham and Nottingham. Technicians union Amicus is also due to hold a separate vote on industrial action among its ITV members over the pay offer. The unions asked for a 6% pay increase for 2005, but launched strike votes after ITV tabled a 3.3% offer earlier this month. The strike vote comes in the same month it emerged that ITV would be making 95 staff around the country redundant, after Ofcom gave the broadcaster the go-ahead to cut its non-news regional output in its English franchises from three hours to 1.5 hours a week. An ITV spokeswoman said: \"268 union members have voted for strike action out of a workforce of more than 6,000 employees. This represents 37% of the people balloted. We remain in continual dialogue with our local shop stewards and we do not believe that this current situation will disrupt our business or affect the programming on offer to our viewers. \"The company has offered an above inflation pay offer (3.3%) backdated to October together with a minimum salary of \u00a313,500 as well as an extra day's holiday this year to celebrate ITV's 50th anniversary. We believe that this is a fair and reasonable offer.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
