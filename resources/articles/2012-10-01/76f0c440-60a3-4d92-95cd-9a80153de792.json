Keats' encomium to autumn needs updating. Were the former Enfield boy to roam around that London suburb now, he would see phalanxes of men marching across lawns \u2013 headphones strapped on and leaf blowers in hand, as if they were extras in a sci-fi remake of The Good Life. The leaf-blower vacuum may confer spurious macho points on its handler, but it is neither as effective nor as elegant as the garden rake. A rake enables almost anyone to gather up leaves and weeds; a leaf vacuum simply blasts stray objects in some direction or other. Where the blower bestows power, the rake offers precision. A leaf blower is the equivalent of those wind machines used in 80s pop videos: a sure sign of terminal decadence. A rake restores the age-old connection between the gardener and the garden. It is quiet; it is unisex. Use one this autumn and bin the blower. Keats would have approved."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
