Laid up by the flu earlier in the week, trussed up on the touchline for 90 minutes, his skin shared the pallor of Everton's shorts and his eyes bulged out of their sockets. Yet the debilitating effects of being a Premiership manager can have advantages: when putting the fear of God into players, it helps to look like the undead. So listless were Everton in the first half of this match, it did not take a Dr Frankenstein to calculate why they were in the middle of one of their worst Premiership seasons. Second to every ball and shorn of any invention, they ambled after claret-and-blue shadows while David O'Leary's men played slick and intuitive football, lit up by Nolberto Solano. After an hour, however, a trick of voodoo magic occurred. Villa, suddenly, were unable to keep possession. Everton, meanwhile, were urgent, direct and winning the tactical battle. Then, on 67 minutes, Tomas Radzinski materialised in place of Steve Watson and the three points were decided. \"It wasn't a classic, but we kept at it and got our goal in the end,\" wheezed Moyes. He explained that Radzinski's arrival offered the opportunity to push Rooney out wide, a position many Evertonians do not like to see him occupy. \"The idea was to play Rooney as a right-sided forward, to play him against Jlloyd Samuel. We were short in the final third today and we knew that if we could give Wayne a little more space he could pick a pass out. In the end it worked a little bit like that.\" In fact it worked a lot like that. Any threat Everton had mustered in the first half had come when Rooney had pulled wide to put extra pressure on Villa's otherwise impressive full-back Samuel. In tandem with Radzinski, however, Rooney raised the pressure and the pair had crafted two opportunities before the opening goal came in the 78th minute. With a quick one-two leaving Samuel behind, Rooney was on the ball and Ronnie Johnsen in a dilemma. Pulling wide to try and snuff out Rooney's threat, Johnsen missed his tackle and while Samuel scampered back to try and block a cross, Radzinski hit the space vacated by Johnsen and met the teenager's lightning centre with a thundering header. David O'Leary's opinion was that the substitution did not have much of an effect but then he had another message to deliver. \"Even before Radzinski came on,\" he said, \"we were the ones who weren't playing the way we can. \"The first 20 minutes we played some decent football, but Everton's desire at the end of the game was far higher than ours. What we've shown over the last few months is that if we're going to win everyone has to give everything, we can't turn up, strut around, and expect to take three points.\" Suspect strutters on the day included Juan Pablo Angel, who was full of one-touch passing but little running, and Lee Hendrie who was notable only for his determination to wind up Rooney. Darius Vassell, too, had one of his more mysterious days, ghosting in to craft two clear opportunities for himself before they vanished thanks to lifeless finishing. Just after half time one poke was tipped over by Nigel Martyn from only six yards. After that, Villa did not really have another chance. One final mystery was the performance of Thomas Gravesen. The midfield linchpin exasperates the Goodison faithful like no other, and in the first half he was truly dreadful. In the second 45, he dominated his opponent Thomas Hitzlsperger and scored a fabulous goal, a 30-yard run that burst through the Villa defence, eluded another flailing challenge from Johnsen, and ended with a cool shot across Thomas Sorenson. \"There were two different players out there, Tommy's brother in the first half and the real Tommy Gravesen in the second,\" said Moyes the blood-curdler. \"Yes, I did have a word at half-time, and you can take that how you want.\" Man of the match: Wayne Rooney (Everton)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
