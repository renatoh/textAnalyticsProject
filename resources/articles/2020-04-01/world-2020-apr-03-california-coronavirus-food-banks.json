One by one, students, teachers, young families and groups of elderly neighbors pulled up to visit a makeshift emergency food bank. To minimize the risk of spreading coronavirus, workers from the food bank asked drivers to pop open their trunks so they could drop in a sack of produce and a box of pantry staples. \u201cThis is my first time ever coming to a food bank,\u201d said Dalia Garcia, as she drove through in an SUV with her husband, baby and mother. \u201cI didn\u2019t need it before,\u201d she said as she collected a flyer explaining how to sign up for the state food benefits program. The pandemic put the 26-year-old hairdresser out of work. \u201cI found out this was happening on Facebook, and I\u2019m glad it\u2019s here,\u201d she said. A few cars down, Terri Birdzull, 59, agreed. \u201cThis is really needed,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing at the stores! And if there is, it\u2019s only the most expensive stuff left over.\u201d The event was organized by the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano, part of the national Feeding America network of food charities, to meet a sudden, unprecedented need. The demand for food aid has increased as much as eightfold in some areas, according to an investigation by the Guardian. In California, despite efforts from federal and state governments to free up emergency food stores and mobilize the national guard to pack and distribute groceries, advocates worry about keeping apace as the logistics of feeding the hungry become more complicated. When Leslie Bacho and the staff at the Second Harvest food bank in California\u2019s Bay Area developed a disaster plan not too long ago, they planned for a big earthquake, widespread wildfires and other natural disasters. \u201cGlobal pandemic was not even on the list of what we were thinking about,\u201d Bacho said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re facing right now is truly unprecedented.\u201d After a natural disaster, local food banks are usually able to call upon other charities, based in unaffected areas, to send staff and supplies, she said. \u201cBut everybody is facing this pandemic at the same time,\u201d she added. Even before coronavirus hit California, Second Harvest was aggressively fundraising, in order to feed the hundreds of thousands of families struggling to survive in one of the most expensive regions of the US. \u201cNow,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s really like a tsunami of need suddenly hitting.\u201d Across the state, food banks said they were scrambling to meet the need, even as the pandemic and distancing measures to mitigate the spread of disease created hurdles. Grocery stores and food manufacturers \u2013 which routinely donate excess produce and staples \u2013 are now giving less food, due to higher demands from consumers stockpiling, said Paul Ash, executive director of the San Francisco-Marin food bank. \u201cWe\u2019re probably going to have to buy more food than we would,\u201d he said. The costs of certain staples are rising as well. As Americans hunker down and stock up their larders, the wholesale price of common \u201cmidwest large\u201d eggs was triple what it was in early March. Such cost increases have already hit food banks, which are depleting their budgets as they buy more to keep up with demand. \u201cWe are ramping up our purchasing, and we\u2019re buying in bulk,\u201d said Michael Altfest, at the Alameda County Food Bank, which serves parts of the East Bay region. \u201cRight now what we need is money.\u201d Distributing the food has also proved to be a challenge, as soup kitchens and free pantries across the country close down. Many of these distribution sites were based at schools, which have now been shut. \u201cOn day one of school closures, we lost access to 45 distribution sites,\u201d said Ash. Some of those schools have allowed food banks to use the grounds to set up food distribution centers. \u201cBut still, we have been scrambling to provide alternate sites and publicize the information,\u201d he said. Another reason for the closures is a lack of volunteers. The seniors and retirees who normally pitch in have been told to shelter at home to avoid contracting coronavirus. Corporate groups and students \u2013 who would often show up in big groups to help out \u2013 are unable to volunteer as much, with colleges shut and companies mandating that staff work from home, Ash said. In response to volunteer shortages in California, the governor, Gavin Newsom, enlisted the state\u2019s national guard to help food banks package food for distribution. But staff at the state\u2019s largest food banks said they were worried about how they would keep up with thousands who had never needed assistance before. \u201cThe thing is we don\u2019t know how long we\u2019ll have this help,\u201d said Cassidie Carmen Bates at the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano. \u201cAnd with that demand growing so quickly, we don\u2019t know how much longer we\u2019ll be able to put out food at this rate.\u201d Guardsmen had helped pack the weighty box that Roxana Samayoa, 38, struggled to carry back home after stopping by the emergency distribution center in Pittsburg. \u201cI never thought we\u2019d need food like this,\u201d said Samayoa. She came to the US from El Salvador a year ago, along with her husband and three children, fleeing violence. \u201cWe were professionals there. My husband was a lawyer, and I a teacher,\u201d she said in Spanish. Now, her husband \u2013 who had been working as a gardener \u2013 has been put out of work. And the preschool where she\u2019d been helping out has closed. \u201cI came here seeking safety,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now I don\u2019t feel safe.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
