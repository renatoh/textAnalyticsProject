The head coach also believes the English game is being \u201cheld back\u201d by tradition and is still not fulfilling its potential. With less than three months to go until the Rugby World Cup kicks off, Jones remains focused on guiding his adopted country to success in Japan but his exasperation with the club-v-country tensions within the English game is increasingly apparent. \u201cI have always thought England have been underperforming,\u201d Jones told the LifeTimes podcast. \u201cIf you have financial security and depth of players, you should be one of the top three countries in the world most of the time, and that hasn\u2019t been the case. \u201cI thought there was an opportunity to do things better, but then you get into the game here and find out why [England underperform]. It\u2019s a difficult job because the national team is a battleground between the clubs and the RFU. You sit in the middle and are blamed for most things. If the clubs aren\u2019t going well it\u2019s your fault, if the RFU aren\u2019t making money it\u2019s your fault. And that\u2019s been the tricky part of it. \u201cThere are wonderful players here and a wonderful opportunity but it\u2019s always being held back by the traditions of the game here. The clubs run themselves basically and the RFU tries to manage it. The RFU has the financial clout but the clubs have the political clout. You need those things to be working together to be sustainably successful. We\u2019ve shown you can have some success here but whether you can be sustainably successful, like New Zealand, in the situation here may be problematic.\u201d In three and a half years since taking the job Jones has worked under four RFU chief executives \u2013 Ian Ritchie, Steve Brown, Nigel Melville and now Bill Sweeney \u2013 and has repeatedly stressed that reforming Twickenham is not part of his role. He has now admitted, however, to some misjudgments as head coach, including employing the wrong assistants and over-training his players during last year\u2019s Six Nations. \u201cYou can recruit the wrong people and I\u2019ve certainly done that. The cultural environment we have is not going to suit everyone. It\u2019s a driven environment \u2026 that\u2019s not for everyone and sometimes you lose people along the way. That doesn\u2019t really concern me. We\u2019ve got to the stage now, after four years, where we\u2019ve got the right staff in place.\u201d Selecting the optimum 31-man playing squad for Japan will be equally crucial and the latest batch of additional names for the preliminary training camps is due to be confirmed on Friday. The Gloucester trio of Danny Cipriani, Ollie Thorley and Willi Heinz, along with Northampton\u2019s Courtney Lawes, are set to be added to the group currently training in Bagshot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
