I don\u2019t do the gym\u2019", "bodyText": "Showboating comes in many guises, from flicks and tricks to ball-juggling and nutmegs, but Wilfried Bony\u2019s personal take involves a demonstration of immense strength. The man who has scored more Premier League goals than anyone else in 2014 likes to play a little game that involves receiving possession with his back to goal, holding off the defender with an outstretched arm while rolling his studs over the top of the ball for as long as he sees fit. Bony breaks into laughter when asked whether the centre-half has any chance of getting to the ball. \u201cDefinitely not! This is my way to play, I can\u2019t run like Nath [Dyer] or [Wayne] Routledge, so I try to bring the defender to where I\u2019m good. If it\u2019s helpful for the team for me to do that, I do it. But sometimes I do it just for fun. It depends on the score, the time. Maybe we need to keep the ball, or we are one- or two-nil up, so I just make the defender angry and show him that he can\u2019t do nothing when I\u2019m there.\u201d The Swansea City striker is as strong as an ox, a powerhouse of a man who stands just under 6ft, weighs 91kg (14st 3lb) and looks, with that barrel chest and thighs like tree trunks, as if he spends his spare time bench-pressing and squatting. \u201cI\u2019m naturally strong \u2013 from my mother, she was a black belt in judo. I don\u2019t do the gym,\u201d Bony says. \u201cI\u2019m already big. I\u2019ve never pushed weights. I don\u2019t have the technique for that. You see players from the youth team, they push 50kg, 100kg, I can\u2019t do that. But on the pitch, it\u2019s something else.\u201d Some of the Swansea players have wondered at times whether the 25-year-old Ivorian knows his own strength. Michel Vorm, Swansea\u2019s former goalkeeper, used to complain that Bony\u2019s play punches were more bruising than the centre-forward realised. \u201cJonjo [Shelvey] says the same when I just brush him on a morning,\u201d Bony says, laughing. \u201cHe says: \u2018Fuck, that\u2019s painful.\u2019 I say: \u2018I didn\u2019t do nothing.\u2019 He says: \u2018Your nothing is more than other people.\u2019\u201d Speaking at Swansea\u2019s training before Saturday\u2019s home game against Crystal Palace, Bony looks and sounds like a man who is enjoying life. He recently signed a contract extension, tying him to the club until 2018, that goal chart for the calendar year shows him leading the way with 17, one ahead of Sergio Ag\u00fcero, and away from football everything is falling into place now that his two boys, aged eight and nine, have settled into life in south Wales. \u201cThey are here with their mum. They are happy and at school, but they say it\u2019s cold,\u201d Bony says, with a chuckle. \u201cThe first time they came to the house, they said they want to have air-conditioning, because it was warm at that moment. The second day, my son went outside and said: \u2018Dad, there is a natural air-conditioning on the street here!\u2019\u201d Bony\u2019s eldest boy, Jeffrey, is a keen footballer and has laid down the gauntlet to his father this season. \u201cHe\u2019s fighting with me every time. He\u2019s a striker as well. He asks me how many goals I score, so he puts it down in his room. Then, when he scores, he writes it down. At the end of the season, he said we\u2019ll count how many we both score. I said: \u2018But you\u2019ll score 50 because your game and my game is not the same!\u2019 He said: \u2018I don\u2019t care, this is my game at my age, you have your game at your age, so we make a competition.\u201d Another form of motivation to hit his targets for the season comes via a personal coach, or what Bony describes as his \u201cphysical preparator\u201d. Bony has been using the Frenchman, whom he prefers not to name, since last December. Looking at his form in the second half of last season, when he scored 17 times between January and May to end up with 25 goals in all competitions, it has been a sound investment. \u201cIf I score 25 goals, if a team pays \u00a325m, it\u2019s nothing compared to what I give to him,\u201d Bony says. \u201cThe club know him, they are happy about that, because he came to see the training, a little bit talking with the coach. It\u2019s good for me. He takes care of everything and helps me physically and psychologically to prepare for my games. It\u2019s been a big success because there is something I missed before \u2013 I was angry if I didn\u2019t play. But you need to control your emotion, no sulking, and just put your team first. He\u2019s always telling me positive things.\u201d By Bony\u2019s own admission, it was a \u201cvery difficult\u201d first few months at Swansea last season. After arriving as a club-record \u00a312m signing from Vitesse Arnhem, Bony was used sparingly by Michael Laudrup and it was hard to escape the feeling that the Dane was never truly convinced by the striker. \u201cI put an impression in my mind, my head, the club spend a lot of money on you and you don\u2019t play,\u201d Bony says. \u201cI won\u2019t talk about everything, but it\u2019s not nice. You can\u2019t explain why you don\u2019t play.\u201d Liberated under Garry Monk, Bony has built on his reputation as one of the most prolific strikers in Europe over the past few years. Indeed it seems incredible to think that the player Ruud Gullit recently described as a \u201cgoal machine\u201d was a centre-half until the age of 14. \u201cI changed to striker one day and straight away, boom, boom, boom,\u201d Bony says. If his father, who was a teacher, had got his way, Bony would have been concentrating on academic work rather than football. There was an awkward stand-off between them for a while. \u201cWe were not talking to each other for almost three years,\u201d Bony says. \u201cHe was thinking about schools. I was almost going to make an exam and I said I wanted to stop and play football, so we were fighting a little bit. But he\u2019s happy now, and there will be a big present next month.\u201d Grand acts of generosity represent quite a shift from a little under a decade ago, when Bony was a young father, without a career and finding it tough to make ends meet. \u201cThat was a difficult time. Oh my God. I didn\u2019t have any work, I had children, they lived with me, with my family. I was struggling and had no money. At that time I was just playing in the street, not in a team. Sometimes my father helped me, but he was not happy because I stopped school. So my mother would take care of everything, and at that moment I was OK.\u201d Bony eventually started to make a name for himself and had a trial at Liverpool at the age of 17. \u201cIt was so quick the way they played, I was not ready for that level,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I came back [home], I saw that it\u2019s not what we are doing here. I thought if I got a second chance, I needed to take it. Two months later I joined Sparta Prague. They helped me a lot. But it was very cold. I didn\u2019t speak English. I didn\u2019t speak Czech. Sometimes they sent me to the left and I went to the right! I was like a crazy guy on the field!\u201d After mastering the Czech language \u2013 \u201cWhen I put my mind to something I can never fail\u201d \u2013 and scoring freely, Bony moved to Vitesse Arnhem in 2011 and another deluge of goals followed, 51 in 69 appearances to be exact. When Bony plundered another 25 in his first season in English football, followed by two goals at the World Cup finals in the summer, the rumour mill went into overdrive, Liverpool were strongly linked and Swansea faced a battle to hold on to their biggest asset. Bony, however, was never convinced that a deal was close \u2013 \u201cIf you score 20 to 25 goals, then people talk about that, for sure, but there was not a real proposition\u201d \u2013 and he had no plans to rock the boat. \u201cI one time did that when I was at Vitesse, it caused a lot of problems at the club, so I don\u2019t think I will do it again. Something can happen, football is crazy. But now I just think about my team and how happy I am here at Swansea, which you can see.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
