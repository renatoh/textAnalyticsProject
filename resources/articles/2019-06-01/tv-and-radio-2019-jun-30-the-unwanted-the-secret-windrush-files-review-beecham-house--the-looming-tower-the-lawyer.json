But, as \u201cLord Kitchener\u201d, who in 1948 sang the first two stanzas of London Is the Place for Me for reporters on Tilbury docks bad-dancing to calypso, his is a name that deserves its place in any history of British racism. The song used to be played by the BBC in gentler times as a celebration of diversity \u2013 I think the corporation was required by statute to use it in any segment mentioning the Windrush \u2013 and, since last year\u2019s scandals over attempted repatriation, replayed with a kind of silent nagging sarcasm. Because London wasn\u2019t the place for them (geddit?). Only meet, then, that it should have bookended David Olusoga\u2019s quietly excoriating documentary The Unwanted: The Secret Windrush Files, about the sly and slimy decades that preceded Theresa May\u2019s 2012-plus \u201chostile environment\u201d, which, no matter how inadvertently and croc-tear regrettably, caught in its web way too many Britons. They were only children when they arrived on His Majesty\u2019s troopship Empire Windrush (the clue\u2019s in the name; they were a part of empire), yet recent years have spun them, now in their 50s and having lived generally splendid (British) lives, into cycles of savage debt and depression. This was important \u2013 no, it was crucial \u2013 watching because, until this very week, in my slothful naivety, I hadn\u2019t truly appreciated the deep levels of historical racism within the British establishment, or press \u2013 and by extension its people \u2013 nor how swiftly a group can be \u201cothered\u201d by a few strokes of a pen, a few cry-wolf headlines. I, in my smugness, tend to congratulate myself on judging people purely by the cuts of their jib, but this was an eye-opener. Because what Olusoga, fast emerging as one of our smartest and kindest modern historians, did was take a teensy bit of all-too-justifiable anger but, quietly and painstakingly and with a minimum of shouty hand-waving from any of the participants, prove that a sizable minority of white people in government and in the press haven\u2019t ever, basically, much liked the idea of black people. It went back to Attlee. No government, left or right, was immune, post-Windrush and ankle-nipped by the press, to covert attempts to stem immigration while studiously not appearing to favour white, \u201csafe\u201d immigration. In 1962, under Macmillan, after a fractious 50s (Churchill had suggested fighting one election on the slogan Keep England White), they almost managed. That year\u2019s Commonwealth Immigrants Act, which promised a voucher scheme based on employment prospects, was greeted by Rab Butler \u2013 I\u2019d once thought him one of the good guys \u2013 as a \u201csad necessity\u201d but, his uncovered memo continued, \u201cthe great merit of this scheme is that it can be presented as making no distinction on grounds of race or colour but would in practice operate on people of colour almost exclusively\u201d. Searing, historically foul and, as I may have mentioned, personally eye-opening, this is what questing TV should be when it quests to change, or even nudge open, minds. Right. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m just going to be a big, fat racist now, but merely setting something among the doe-eyed maidens of 1790s India does not a cultural exploration make. You could have sloshed barefoot through the social/historical lessons of Beecham House and kept your ankles dry. To be fair, it was surely never intended as much more than a Sunday night slice of high-end, sunny, exotic sari-ripping, and to that end it worked with some splendour. Yet there were the doleful expositions \u2013 I half-expected some misbegotten character to point out \u201cthis is, of course, almost 60 years before the Raj, or Crown Rule, came into India, thence to last till 1947\u201d; and the cliches. There was the angry male Indian. There was the docile and subservient female Indian. There was a Brit chap who stood as if inviting all ladies present to gaze longingly on his britches (one did, and she wasn\u2019t fly about it. No punjab intended). Only the nominal stars \u2013 Dakota Blue Richards, a much-missed placement in Endeavour, and one of the Toms or Rosses who frequently and occasionally shirtlessly adorn our Sunday nights (Hardy/Bateman/Poldark, in this case I think Bateman) \u2013 had any character whatsoever to play with. For all that, it\u2019s jolly enough. Think of it as Death in Paradise with a much bigger budget, a lot more elephants and, hard though this may be to imagine, more credible acting. The Looming Tower drew to its unconscionable climax. The towers fell. (Or did they? Hmm. That\u2019s a question. The answer is yes, as it should be, for example, to: \u201cWould it be a good idea to make children much safer with a small lifelong injection?\u201d) Among other aspects this phenomenal series has revealed is the urgent love with which America has (still) always serenaded Saudi Arabia. The CIA\u2019s mantra was \u201cSaudi shall simply never go down\u201d. The grubby politicking between the CIA and FBI has never been more gruesomely portrayed; despite the fine brushed-clean homeland desks of both agencies, you couldn\u2019t help but itch to want to scrub your fingernails and run from the room, sobbing for a, or indeed any, truth. Jeff Daniels and Tahar Rahim have been standout in their flawed but simple empathy for other human beings. Oddly for this age, women got a bum rap: Condoleezza Rice and the female-heavy CIA team who denied shared intelligence are proof if proof were needed that, when it comes to gender, the capacity to attain dickhood is fluid. Rather terrific all round, and such a lump in the throat at the realisation that Daniels\u2019s John O\u2019Neill really did go down with the towers: but it\u2019s hard to entirely celebrate a series that I so savagely wish hadn\u2019t had to be made. If only\u2026 can there be two more lonesome mournful words? The Lawyer, a new thing from that grand Walter Presents strand, is a deeply moreish Scando-thriller, just not in that vein. No psychological angst, no sex-jerseys, no dark nights of the soul or chess-bouts with Death: a simple Danish-Swedish mafia potboiler, heavy with trips across that bridge and beetle-browed menace and damned fine Ikea apartments: you\u2019ll love it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
