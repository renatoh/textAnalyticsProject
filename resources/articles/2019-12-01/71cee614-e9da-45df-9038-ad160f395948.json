Many observers interpreted the outburst \u2013 which came as a new poll showed Bolsonaro\u2019s approval ratings hitting record lows \u2013 as a deliberate attempt to draw the media\u2019s gaze away from the investigation into his senator son Fl\u00e1vio. But Bolsonaro\u2019s homophobic comment served only to further highlight the inquiry into whether Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro oversaw a corruption racket during his time as a lawmaker in Rio de Janeiro. Part of the investigation focuses on suspicions Fl\u00e1vio laundered money through a chocolate shop registered with authorities under the name Bolsotini. Manuela D\u2019\u00c1vila, a prominent leftist politician, tweeted: \u201cBolsonaro is committing the crime of homophobia in order to make us forget his son\u2019s schemes. But we won\u2019t forget. He\u2019s a homophobe and his son \u2026\u201d The scandal has the potential to cause serious problems for Brazil\u2019s president, who swept to power last year promising to eradicate corruption after what some called the greatest corruption scandal in history. Particularly compromising are the apparent connections, suggested by the investigation, between members of Rio\u2019s mafia and the Bolsonaro family. One of those allegedly involved in Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro\u2019s suspected corruption scheme is the wife of Adriano da N\u00f3brega, a former special forces police operative who is currently on the run and is suspected of running a gang of contract killers one Brazilian newspaper has called Rio\u2019s \u201cmost lethal and secretive phalanx of hired guns\u201d. Members of that group are suspected to have taken part in the 2018 murder of Rio politician Marielle Franco. On Friday, a new poll showed the number of Brazilians who disapprove of Bolsonaro\u2019s administration had jumped to 53%. Those who thought it bad or awful stood at 38%, compared with 27% after he took office. Bolsonarista officials have rejected any suggestion of wrongdoing. The presidential spokesman, F\u00e1bio Wajngarten, this week denounced what he called the media\u2019s \u201cinsane and abominable persecution\u201d of the Bolsonaros. In a YouTube video posted on Thursday, Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro insisted he had nothing to hide, and claimed the investigation was part of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d involving \u201cmany powerful people\u201d to destabilize Brazil and force his father from power."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
