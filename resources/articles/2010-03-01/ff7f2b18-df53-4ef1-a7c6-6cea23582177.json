Ministers intend to reject a Tory compromise that DNA profiles of innocent people be kept for only three years, and instead make it an election issue. Home Office sources indicate that the government is \"in no mind to weaken\" its DNA provisions and argue that the Conservative compromise will involve the police having to go repeatedly to the courts if they want to keep a DNA profile beyond three years. Labour has already produced a campaign video which effectively accuses the Tories of being \"the burglar's friend\" for voting against the changes to the DNA retention regime. Johnson calculates that the shadow home secretary, Chris Grayling, has little support from police and victims on the issue, and that it would prove an unpopular position among his own party if it were better known. Senior police officers and civil liberty campaigners expressed concern tonight that the move could mean another six months of confusion for the 900,000 people who have been arrested but never convicted of an offence and whose DNA profiles are stored on the police database. Police forces have continued to add the DNA profiles of 30,000 more innocent people to the database every month despite a ruling by the European court of human rights in December 2008 that indefinite retention was illegal. The government's crime and security bill, which includes the controversial DNA retention regime, has already passed through the Commons and is scheduled to have its second reading in the Lords on 29 March. Peers killed off an earlier attempt by the government to keep innocent DNA for up to 12 years and it is expected the six-year proposal will face renewed opposition. The fate of the bill will be decided in the parliamentary \"wash-up\" week, which is held after the election is called but before parliament is dissolved \u2013 and is now widely expected in Whitehall to take place in the week beginning 5 April. Negotiations are under way over which bills are likely to be abandoned. Ministers are prepared to ditch the DNA provisions to get the rest of the crime and security bill on to the statute book. The legislation includes gang injunctions against under-18s, tightening of laws on antisocial behaviour, banning mobile phones in prison and compensating British victims of terrorism overseas. Senior police sources said they needed the legal confusion cleared up. \"The police service felt that the retention periods put forward were in the right area, but it is for parliament to decide,\" said a spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers. Chief constables have been criticised for turning down requests from innocent individuals to delete their DNA profiles. The director of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, said that if the government sabotaged its own legislation Britain's continuing \"violation of the court judgment\" would be \"a cynical election stunt\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
