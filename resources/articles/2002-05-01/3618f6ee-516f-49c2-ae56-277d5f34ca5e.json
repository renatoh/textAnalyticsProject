Nevertheless, Robin Cook pulled on his Captain Webb-style striped swimmers, put on his goggles, inserted his nose plugs, and plunged boldly into the thick, swampy morass. But first - Stephen Byers. Again. For years Mr Byers has been making frequent appearances in the House of Commons. Recently these have occurred daily. There is a strict etiquette to be observed. The Tories tell him he is the scum of the earth, he shouts back in his curious piping voice, Labour MPs speak about him as if he were a combination of Churchill and Constantine, and nothing changes except that the attacks become more strident, and the press ever more vituperative. The Potters Bar crash has taken the pressure off Mr Byers for the first time in months, demonstrating how grim and twisted a politician's life can be. Even the Tories weren't going to make party political capital out of this disaster - at least not yet. He praised the emergency services, over and over again. He sympathised with the victims. In his peroration he sketched out a magnificent New Labour plan of action, consisting entirely of truisms and aspirations. It's a measure of whether something was hardly worth saying if the opposite makes no sense. Thus: \"It is vital that we discover not just what happened at Potters Bar but how it happened.\" (\"It is vital that we discover what happened, but not how it happened.\") \"We owe a responsibility to all those involved... to identify exactly what took place and then take the necessary steps in response.\" (\"We need only a rough idea of what happened, and will ignore it anyway.\") And so on. All quite meaningless when you looked at it. Mr Byers had almost nothing to say, but said it with gravity and without opposition. It made a change. Recently he has sounded at the edge of his reason, a fact concealed only by the hideous barrage of noise he has to face. Meanwhile, MPs lined up to say how their seats were crossed by the London-King's Lynn line and how deeply their constituents had been affected. Mr Byers cannot make this claim, but pointed out that he had taken that service when on his way to visit friends in Cambridge. Then Henry Bellingham, the MP for Norfolk North West, capped them all by saying that he had \"come very close\" to catching that particular train but, thank heavens, had decided to catch an earlier one. Oddly enough, the house did not suck its teeth in collective horror. One of the few political points came from Labour's Diane Abbott. How was it, she wondered, that Londoners were about to have the same system which created Railtrack foisted onto their underground. Mr Byers said that the scheme - the one which gave us Potters Bar, Hatfield, etc - was vital \"for modernisation to go ahead.\" Like everything else connected with Mr Byers, it was a horribly depressing line. Next Robin Cook announced that a new committee of both houses would be set up to contemplate reform of the House of Lords. It was an amazing moment. Normally the government says what it wants and instructs parliament to agree. Now they are asking MPs and peers first. Things must be worse than we thought. Clearly they have no idea what to do, how to achieve it and how it might be pushed through parliament. Mr Cook is facing a very long and a very sticky swim."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
