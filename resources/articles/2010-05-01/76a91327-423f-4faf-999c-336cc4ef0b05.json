Mancienne spent last season on loan at Molineux and Wolves were keen to explore the possibility of him returning but, with every Premier League club required to name at least eight homegrown players in a squad of 25 when the transfer window closes at the end of August, Chelsea are reluctant to sanction the 22-year-old's departure. The Wolves striker Sam Vokes has signed a contract extension to 2013. The 20-year-old Wales international had two years to run on his deal but has signed for an extra season. \"It's a great boost to me to have an extra year to my contract,\" Vokes told the club's website. \"And the club staying in the Premier League has just added to it. It's nice security for me to come back for a season and know I've still got three years left on my deal.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
