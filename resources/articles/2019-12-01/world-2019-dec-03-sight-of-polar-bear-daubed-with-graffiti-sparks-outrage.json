Scientists were concerned that the bear filmed in Russia \u2013 daubed with the letters \u201cT-34\u201d, the name of a second world war-era Soviet tank \u2013 would have trouble hunting and maintaining camouflage with the black lettering clearly visible on its side. A senior Russian state biologist has said they are trying to identify where the video of the bear was shot. Scientists speculated that the animal, which was recorded walking near a road at an unknown location in Russia, would have to have been sedated for someone to paint the letters on its flank. Some Russians often paint the same letters on their cars for the Victory Day holiday marking the end of the second world war in May, and it was not immediately clear whether the letters had been written by angry locals or as a practical joke. Climate change has driven Russia\u2019s Arctic polar bear population into closer contact with humans, as hungry bears looking for food have increasingly foraged in towns in northern Russia. A town in Novaya Zemlya, an island chain off of northern Russia, saw an influx of more than 50 polar bears in February this year. The video of the bear was uploaded to Facebook by Sergey Kavry, a World Wildlife Federation employee based in Russia\u2019s Far East. He said he received the footage through a WhatsApp chat group. \u201cWhy?!\u201d he wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cHe won\u2019t be able to hunt without being noticed!\u201d Anatoly Kochnev, a senior researcher at a state-run biology institute, noted that there was \u201cturmoil\u201d on Novaya Zemlya earlier this year because of the number of polar bears entering residential areas and that locals may have stepped up measures to stop the bears. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that they took steps there this winter \u2013 capture, sedation \u2013 and since it\u2019s not scientists doing this, then some jokers [spray-painted the bear],\u201d he told the RIA Novosti state news agency."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
