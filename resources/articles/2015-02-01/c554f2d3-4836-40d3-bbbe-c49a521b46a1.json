But after another defeat to one of the world\u2019s top nations, and with the World Cup finals in Canada only four months away, Sampson concluded ruefully that, \u201ceventually, we\u2019ve got to find away to win.\u201d Finding a way to win against the best will be vital if England are to be successful in the summer, but despite a defeat against the world\u2019s second best side coming in the wake of November\u2019s 3-0 trouncing by Germany, the top team, at Wembley, Sampson feels his side are on track. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased with the progress the team have made,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019re keen to take on more of these challenges. The work ethic of the players tonight was outstanding, and we deserved at least a draw \u2013 especially bearing in mind we scored a perfectly good goal. \u201cWe weren\u2019t cut open at all and although the Americans got too many balls into the box for our liking, we defended those crosses admirably in the main.\u201d Sampson had made five changes from the team that lost to Germany, dropping his midfield diamond formation for a more solid 4-4-2. \u201cIt worked well,\u201d he said, \u201cthe two centre backs and two central midfielders stepped up to the plate and we stood up well to America\u2019s physicality. \u201cIt\u2019s about learning and the team getting better. The players had dusted themselves down after the Germany game and they were much better tonight.\u201d One player unable to \u201cstep up to the plate\u201d was the Chelsea captain Katie Chapman, recalled to the squad after four years in the international wilderness but an unused substitute. Chapman had been in an unwanted \u201cretirement\u201d after childcare issues, leading to an impasse with the former coach Hope Powell that had resulted in her departure. \u201cIt would have been great to get Katie some minutes,\u201d said Sampson. \u201cI\u2019m sure she would have loved that opportunity. It was a real special moment in the team room earlier today when Katie got handed her jersey, I think she certainly shed a few tears, it was an important moment for her but the most important thing for Katie was to get her back in the group and see how she fitted in \u2013 and she fitted in fantastically well. \u201cIt would have been nice to get her on if the circumstances had been different, but unfortunately they weren\u2019t. We would have liked to be ahead and get Katie on to see it out, but I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll play a big part for us in the future.\u201d After a tentative opening, the decisive goal came when the USA midfielder Lauren Holiday crossed for Morgan to head home all too easily after 25 minutes. It was the 50th goal of her career in 79 appearances. England struggled to create too many clear-cut chances but their best came when the Reading striker Fran Kirby lofted in a 20-yard shot that was turned on to the crossbar by the keeper Ashlyn Harris, and though Kirby\u2019s strike partner Jodie Taylor tucked in the rebound the flag was up for offside \u2013 though replays showed that she had been well onside."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
