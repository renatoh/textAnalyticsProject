For the past month, the government's NHS reforms have dominated the airwaves and commentaries. The NHS is beloved of the voters and the Lansley reforms are highly unpopular. The reforms have embarrassed many Conservatives and have split the Liberal Democrats. In the Commons, Ed Miliband has duly concentrated his fire on David Cameron on this issue to the exclusion of almost all others. And the upshot? This month, the Tories and the Liberal Democrats have both gained support, while Labour has dropped back. With just over six weeks to go before the local elections, the Tories now lead Labour by three points. The coalition parties' combined lead over Labour is 18. Politics can be an unforgiving business. The key to the new poll's state-of-the-parties ratings probably lies in the coalition's continuing strong ratings on the economy. Today's poll finds that Mr Cameron and George Osborne have a 17-point lead over Mr Miliband and Ed Balls as the best team to manage the economy. That rating has stayed solid for many months now, even though the coalition's economic strategy and many of its specific economic measures are themselves disliked at the same time. The conclusion from this is not difficult to draw. Voters may not like the coalition's austerity measures or its fiscal priorities. But they like Labour's ideas and trust Labour's leaders even less. That's true in all parts of the United Kingdom, including those where Labour is traditionally strong. These poll findings are as much a damning report on Labour's failings as they are a glowing one on any coalition achievements. There's not a lot for Mr Osborne to be complacent about, however. In the past few days there have been plenty of headlines about measures that he may announce tomorrow. The poll, though, does not suggest much enthusiasm for any of them. Reducing the current 50p top rate of income tax, heavily trailed in recent days, is certainly not popular \u2013 the poll finds 67% support for keeping it, with Tory voters almost as firmly committed to maintaining the existing top rate as other voters. Meanwhile a mansion tax on the rich would also win the public's support \u2013 with 62% telling the pollsters it is a good idea. Voters, especially women, are wary about higher earners losing their child benefit rights, however. There is very little support for the chancellor using extra funds to pay down the deficit. Voters are not stupid. They seem ready to tolerate austerity and hard times as long as they believe the rhetoric about sharing the burden fairly. Mr Osborne's expected announcements about loosening the Sunday trading laws during the Olympics, about handing over significant parts of the road network to private companies or the privatisation of the Royal Mail, probably do not challenge this principle, even though each is controversial in other ways. The Sunday trading liberalisation in particular is difficult to square with the government's supposed priority towards family life. This poll would tell a politically astute chancellor not to push his luck. Mr Osborne has a reputation for astuteness. But he knows he does not owe his lead on economic management to a great record on growth, employment, investment or Britain's credit rating. All are worse than two years ago. The downward readjustments of his forecasts in the autumn statement were a humbling affair. Mr Osborne owes his lead to Labour failings and to some surviving trust, now stretched close to breaking, in the coalition rhetoric about us all being in this together and the largest burdens having to be borne by those with the broadest shoulders. That narrative is hard to square with cuts in the top rate or with the freezing of the minimum wage. Mr Osborne will take a huge gamble with the coalition's ratings and credibility if he emerges from tomorrow as the man whose headline reaction to a stalling economy is to make life even easier for the rich."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
