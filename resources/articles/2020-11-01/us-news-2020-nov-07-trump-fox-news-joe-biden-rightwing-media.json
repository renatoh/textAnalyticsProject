The conservative cable news channel, which angered Trumpists by calling Arizona for Biden before any other network, has been subject to attacks from the president and his most fervent supporters, who have seen Fox\u2019s refusal to distort the truth about the vote count as a betrayal. Reportedly, Trumpist dismay at the call was voiced at the highest levels, with Trump himself calling in a complaint to Rupert Murdoch, who stood by the network\u2019s coverage. Writing in the conspiracist hub WND on Saturday morning, attorney Larry Klayman \u2013 who the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as \u201cpathologically litigious\u201d \u2013 wrote: \u201cDo not be fooled by the gyrations of Fox News or other \u2018mainstream\u2019 so-called conservative media, which are, as usual, holding out false hope that the legal system will right the wrongs that occurred on 3 November.\u201d Inside the rightwing media bubble, appending \u201cmainstream\u201d to a description of any outlet is fighting talk, and \u201cmainstream conservative\u201d is tantamount to an accusation of treason. On the Trumpist website American Greatness, the site\u2019s prolific opinionista Christopher Gage fumed: \u201cI\u2019m not sure what they think they are doing, nor who think they are, nor whether they know their game is up and they\u2019re enjoying one last spasm of untruth, but Fox News is not the electoral college, nor is it the supreme court.\u201d Later, after AP\u2019s call was dutifully reported by Fox, pro-Trump Breitbart News sulkily listed them, along with CNN and MSNBC, as one of the \u201ccorporate media outlets\u201d that had called the election for Biden. On the conspiracy-minded Gateway Pundit, Jim Hoft likewise assimilated \u201cFaux FOX\u201d to the \u201cAlphabet Media\u201d outlets which together had carried out a \u201ccoordinated attack against the president as he was out golfing\u201d. Other News Corp outlets appeared to pile on to Trump during the week, including the New York Post, which characterized a meandering Trump speech on Thursday as \u201cdowncast\u201d, and correctly described his claims about election fraud as \u201cbaseless\u201d. Throughout October, the same newspaper, almost alone among mainstream outlets, had retailed the widely criticized story based on a supposed copy of the contents of Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop. What was at stake on election night for Trump was a narrative he had been preparing in advance: a close and \u201crigged\u201d election, whose result he hoped to have determined in his favor by friendly courts. Post-election, pro-Trump media resented the Decision Desk for undermining their attempts to mobilize the president\u2019s supporters to disrupt outstanding counts in contested states. For many of these outlets, their preferred tool was a torrent of disinformation encouraging the idea that the election had been stolen. By Saturday, a stream of stories alleging that isolated (and expected) voter machine glitches were evidence that Democrats had orchestrated election theft were published on PJ Media, Infowars and WND. Meanwhile, Maga-world grifters such as Mike Coudrey (formerly known as \u201cMike Tokes\u201d) urged Trump loyalists to mobilize for protests at \u201cEVERY STATE CAPITOL\u201d in an effort inelegantly marketed as \u201c#stopthesteal\u201d. (On Wednesday, Trump was told by his advisers that his own demand to \u201cstop the count\u201d would instantly cost him the election.) Fox News, for the most part, did not play along. Their White House reporter, John Roberts, held out the \u201cchance\u201d on Friday morning that the president might concede a loss \u201cfor the preservation of democracy and the unity of the nation\u201d. On Saturday, they featured a parade of guests, including prominent Republicans like Karl Rove, who each endorsed the AP projection, further isolating the president and his supporters. (Other establishment conservative outlets such as the National Review also followed Fox\u2019s lead in acknowledging the reality of Biden\u2019s victory.) It is worth noting that the network was not wholly unanimous in its message that Trump had lost the election. On Friday night, Tucker Carlson hosted Darren Beattie, the founder of the Revolver website and a former Trump speechwriter who was fired in 2018 for attending an event alongside white nationalists. Carlson allowed Beattie, whose website was a key vector for the \u201cPizzagating\u201d of Hunter Biden, to assert that the post-election situation in the US was a \u201cvery specific kind of coup \u2026 a \u2018Color Revolution\u2019\u201d, being coordinated by a lawyer inside the \u201cnational security apparatus\u201d. But other hosts appeared to be speaking directly to the president \u2013 a habitual Fox News viewer \u2013 and attempting to let him down gently. On Friday night\u2019s Ingraham Angle, host Laura Ingraham set out an obsequious account of Trump\u2019s supposed achievements. But she then appeared to appeal to the president\u2019s vanity and the shreds of his supporters\u2019 belief in the legitimacy of the political process. \u201cLosing, if that\u2019s what happens, is awful. But President Trump\u2019s legacy will only become more significant if he focuses on moving the country forward. And then, the love and respect his supporters feel for him is only going to grow stronger\u201d. She urged him to accept defeat with \u201cgrace and composure\u201d. If it made an impression on the president, it was not evident in his tweets on Saturday morning, nor in a statement he issued asserting \u2013 with little basis \u2013 that the election was \u201cfar from over\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
