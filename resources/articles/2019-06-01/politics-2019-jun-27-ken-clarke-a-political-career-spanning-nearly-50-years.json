Clarke replied that it was probably somewhere close to that date, but that he could not precisely remember. It was, in fact, more or less exact \u2013 19 June. One the same date in 1970, in the early hours of the morning, a then 29-year-old Clarke was declared the winner in the Nottinghamshire seat of Rushcliffe. Even then, he was not a novice, having already twice contested nearby Mansfield. He has kept the same seat ever since. From his start as an assistant whip in 1972, Clarke also spent the next 27 years, barring a couple of brief gaps, in various shadow and government front bench jobs, including health, education and home secretary, followed by four years as John Major\u2019s chancellor. He even made a late return to ministerial life, serving for two years as justice secretary under David Cameron. At a few days shy of his 79th birthday, Clarke is not the oldest MP in the Commons \u2013 Labour\u2019s Dennis Skinner is 87. He does, however, have the title of father of the house, for the longest-serving MP, even though Skinner was also first elected in 1970. The title was his, Clarke told the political journalists\u2019 lunch at which he announced his likely decision to step down at the next election, because he was sworn in as an MP shortly before Skinner. \u201cAt the moment I save the House of Commons from having Dennis Skinner as father of the house by 25 minutes,\u201d he said. Such longevity as a minister points to Clarke\u2019s long-standing status as what he still regards as being a moderate, centrist Conservative, as well as being one with a generally positive public image, helped by his much-covered fondness for cigars, jazz and comfortable shoes. But as an avowed Europhile, amid what Clarke regards as the madness of Brexit, he is now seen as a fringe Tory figure, one who concedes he could even help vote down a Boris Johnson government to stop no deal. This is, Clarke makes clear, not a case of him changing his views, but of his party leaving him. Clarke told the lunch that the Commons of 1970 was \u201ca completely different institution\u201d to that which he sees now: \u201cI began in parliament with quite a lot of members of parliament who\u2019d started before the war. I met those who, people told me, had been very much in favour of appeasement.\u201d One change, he said, was the reduction in the number of MPs who took outside work: \u201cWhen I was elected, every Conservative MP made his living outside the House of Commons. They came in in the afternoons and evenings. And it was a much more powerful House of Commons, a much more effective political system.\u201d It is, of course, worth remembering that Clarke has pledged to go before. Before the 2015 election he said it would be his last, only to change his mind two years later. Clarke told the lunch \u2013 albeit mainly in jest \u2013 that he could still try again: \u201cIt\u2019s a great pity, in the middle of such a historic crisis. All the temptation is there for me to carry on. If I\u2019ve been thrown out of the Conservative party by then, one of the other parties might tempt me to run for them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
