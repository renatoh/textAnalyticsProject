A summer song worth risking a cornea for, in our opinion. SW Beyonc\u00e9 Crazy in Love Crazy in Love is now so old that it genuinely contains the lyric \u201cgot me hoping you\u2019ll page me right now\u201d. Yet somehow, no matter how many times you hear it, it doesn\u2019t seem to tire. Even the endless Glee covers, or the funeral march version Beyonc\u00e9 recorded for the 50 Shades of Grey soundtrack hasn\u2019t sullied it. SW Dizzee Rascal Bonkers When I was a child and I imagined what being on drugs was like, the noise inside my head was the rough approximation of this entire song, just with more policemen yelling at me. Now I\u2019m an adult, I\u2019m like: \u201cDamn kid. Failed your SATs but got that one right.\u201d JG Daft Punk Get Lucky Listen: we all overdid it. It\u2019s fine. Admit it now. We overplayed this song. We hammered it into the ground like a nail. It\u2019s been six years. Try it again. The little guitar riff: buh bonky bonkedy bonk. Is that a pineapple full of rum in your hand? Were those sunglasses on your face? They were not. I\u2019m afraid it is time for you to \u2026 get lucky. JG Rihanna ft Drake Work Work is sweat; it\u2019s sand in your crevices; it\u2019s that cool drip of water racing down the side of a pre-mixed cocktail can towards your thigh. Work is summer in a song; it\u2019s dry-humping anything that moves; it\u2019s Lilt; it\u2019s Rihanna in excelsis; and it\u2019s so good it doesn\u2019t matter that Drake almost ruins it. MC Lil Nas X Old Town Road One of those rare viral moments that transcends the internet and becomes a hit on planet normie. Time will tell if Lil Nas X ends up like that kid who signed a record deal after yodelling in supermarkets and ended up \u2026 yodelling in more supermarkets. SW Nelly Hot in Herre Nelly does a searing job here: \u201cIt\u2019s getting hot in here / So take off all your clothes\u201d, seeming more like some urgent government warning than a creepy chat-up line. SW Carly Rae Jepsen Call Me Maybe Is Call Me Maybe a summer banger? Not really: it\u2019s a sort of for ever-banger that just seems to make more sense in summer. If you haven\u2019t \u201caccidentally\u201d sprayed someone with the hose while washing their car on a blazing hot July day to the heady sounds of Carly Rae, though, then have you really been in love? Think about it. Not sure you have. Annul your marriage. JG DJ Khaled Wild Thoughts You, a low-ceilinged club with sweat on the walls, some very earnest chats with strangers in the bathroom, holding a can of beer to your head in a futile attempt to cool your blood: summer is here, and Wild Thoughts is the capital-H Horny soundtrack to it all. That said, the \u201cburned out, cremation\u201d line shouldn\u2019t have got past as many people as it did. JG Luis Fonzi ft Justin Bieber Despacito We should scrap star signs and just assign people personality matrices based on which bit of Despacito they sing along to. Here\u2019s my dating profile: \u201cFavorito Favorito baby looking for his Sube Sube, Sube Sube Sube. Bom Boms need not apply. Had my time wasted enough.\u201d JG Katy Perry California Gurls This song very urgently makes me want to untie the front of my bikini top despite never ever having worn one in my life. It is actually quite a weird feeling. I\u2019m turning this one off. I don\u2019t need this energy ruining my summer. JG Azealia Banks 212 In 2012, it seemed impossible that you could still have that feeling that people had the first time they heard the Velvet Underground or Public Enemy \u2013 of hearing a bolt from the blue that didn\u2019t sound like anything else. Yet 212 had that thrill, wonderfully explicitly, full of giddy cunnilanguage and nods to German house and New York disco. Now Azealia is better known for winding up Elon Musk, but this remains a perfect three minutes and 30 seconds. SW Justin Timberlake Can\u2019t Stop the Feeling In which a pre-lumberjack, post-hair relaxer Justin \u201cJT\u201d Timberlake shouts the word \u201cdance\u201d and \u201cwavy\u201d at some kids with the manic enthusiasm of a children\u2019s TV presenter whose home life is catastrophically falling apart. Guaranteed to get nervy uncle Clive dancing at the family barbecue, mind you. MC Mariah Carey We Belong Together Sure, long summer days are great, but be warned: the heatstroke-aggravated, tequila-assisted evening meltdown that often involves screaming about loyalty in the ear of someone you have only snogged once while every emotion you\u2019ve ever felt comes racing towards the surface \u2013 this is the soundtrack to that, basically. Altogether now: \u201cOh baby baby, we belong together.\u201d *Vomits* MC Iggy Azalea Fancy Very weird couple of weeks when Azalea was the biggest rapper in the world before everyone woke up from a love spell and decided she was a fraud. Still, you can\u2019t argue with this bassline and Charli XCX\u2019s rebellious vocal, which recalls that Shampoo/Daphne and Celeste era of pop when all you needed to do to be a bad girl was bunk off school and swear at your parents. SW Drake ft Wizkid &amp; Kyla One Dance In the future, when the concept of seasons is something we only remember via Instagram filters, people will ask what \u201csummer\u201d was exactly. And they\u2019ll be playing One Dance via a speaker in their finger and they\u2019ll smile fondly and say: \u201cWow, that must have been quite nice.\u201d And they\u2019d be right. MC Psy Gangnam Style One summer, my friend Richard shat himself while rollerblading, for ever tarnishing quite a nice memory of warm, endless evenings for me. Gangnam Style \u2013 essentially the musical equivalent of a thousand Instant Idiot: Just Add Alcohol \u201ccomedy\u201d T-shirts \u2013 carries the same summer-spoiling properties, reminding everyone that fun can be shat on at any moment. MC Ed Sheeran I Don\u2019t Care Why are so many of Robert De Niro\u2019s films terrible? Why wasn\u2019t there a single good gag in the last two seasons of Seinfeld? Because when you are at the top of the game you can give up trying and just churn out Skyped-in rehashes of your previous successes and wait for the cheques to roll in. SW Robin Thicke Blurred Lines Reluctant to big this song up too much in case the ghost of Marvin Gaye sues me or I get picketed by an entire university but: if you somehow strip this song of every scrap of context; if you forget the last five years of discourse; if you ignore \u201cWhat rhymes with hug me?\u201d: this song is designed to make men in red trousers embarrass themselves at a Henley afterparty, and for that reason alone, I suppose it still has a place in the summer canon. JG Cardi B ft Bad Bunny &amp; J Balvin I Like It Winter would be a lot easier to take if this ludicrous Latin-trap hybrid was pumped into every home rather than people relying on those weirdly shaped Sad lamps that always seemed like a Charlie Brooker invention anyway. The real star of this three-way pileup is Cardi B, obviously, who radiates a sort of barbecue-in-the-park-charm, even when comparing sex to furiously beating a pi\u00f1ata. MC Katy Perry I Kissed a Girl Look, let\u2019s not lie to ourselves: we all feel hornier in the summer. We also get sweaty backs, unsightly blotches, look awful in shorts, smell weird and have a continuous film of sweat on our hands. I Kissed a Girl, Perry\u2019s unsurprisingly problematic sapphic banger, is the perfect encapsulation of that constant battle between sexy and really, really unsexy. MC Black Eyed Peas I Gotta Feeling I know we\u2019re all sick of will.i.am now (launch another smartwatch about it, mate! Say something mad about wet wipes!) but with time away from him we can finally admit: he and the BEP made a curious sub-category of banger; the \u201cjust got passed the Aux cord in the back of an Uber\u201d jam, and this is the best of them. JG LMFAO ft Lauren Bennett &amp; GoonRock Party Rock Anthem If they remade Big now with your younger brother who does Fortnite dances so frantically you\u2019re worried he might not make it into his preferred secondary school, the plot would be: he gets big, he somehow forms LMFAO (with his uncle???), he makes the song Party Rock Anthem, he falls very in love with cocaine. I would, to be fair, watch it. JG Flo Rida ft David Guetta Club Can\u2019t Handle Me Basically I Gotta Feeling but featuring a super Auto-Tuned Flo Rida instead of Black Eyed Peas, Club Can\u2019t Handle Me is big night out in 2010 vibes: poppin\u2019 bottles, stripping off, sweaty nightclub, hands in the air. However, let\u2019s be real. Club can\u2019t handle you right now? Rest assured that yes, Liquid nightclub in Basingstoke can, and also it\u2019s \u00a39 for a Smirnoff Ice, thanks very much. IS BodyRockers I Like the Way This is an actual pervert\u2019s anthem. If someone crept up behind you and growled: \u201cI like the way you \u2026 act all surprised\u201d in your ear, you\u2019d call the police immediately. The vocalist\u2019s delivery suggests he\u2019s simultaneously orgasming and shitting. However, in 2005, it was basically illegal for clubs not to play it eight times a night. Weird. IS Pitbull Hotel Room Service Sampling \u2013 and ruining \u2013 the Nightcrawlers\u2019 Push the Feeling On is quite the achievement, but Pitbull did it! Shame on everyone who danced to this in the summer of 2009 because, on closer listen, Pitbull is inviting you to an orgy in a budget hotel where he declares \u201cI\u2019m the plumber tonight / I\u2019ll check yo pipes\u201d and seems to be threatening to ejaculate in your eye. Not so fun now, is it? IS Cascada Evacuate the Dancefloor Summer requires two songs to help guide us all safely to the end of it: a song to do shots to, and a song to vomit shots out to. Evacuate the Dancefloor is both of those songs. JG George Ezra Shotgun Some summer anthems earn their place by being instant classics that encapsulate the pure joy and excitement of summer. Others just mention lots of holiday words (hot sun, bikini bottoms, lager tops) and have simple lyrics that are easy for drunk festival crowds to chant. Shotgun is definitely one of these two things. IS Las Ketchup The Ketchup Song You think you\u2019re too good to try to remember the Las Ketchup dance at a heady summer marquee wedding, with sweat glistening on your forehead and children skidding around you on their knees \u2013 all the nans have got lifts home so the real fun can start \u2013 but you\u2019re not and you never will be. You think you\u2019re too good to say: \u201cHey, ha!\u201d a lot? You think you\u2019re too good for fun? You disgust me. JG Omi Cheerleader Cheerleader \u2013 or rather 2014\u2019s Felix Jaehn remix \u2013 came out in that summer we were all really into tropical house, AKA before Ed Sheeran got involved and every song had to have a horn on it. But in 2019, it\u2019s like looking back at a terrible ex, if your ex was an annoying nursery rhyme-like song. Were you only into them because they were there? Were they actually quite irritating? What were you thinking?! IS"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
