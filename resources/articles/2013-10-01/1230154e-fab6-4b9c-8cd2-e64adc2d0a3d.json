But perhaps Smith's observation is due for something of a revision. Britain is losing its thirst for alcohol, according to the new edition of the pub trade's \"bible\", which finds that consumption of intoxicating beers, spirits and wines has fallen to levels not seen since the last millennium. And while the findings will help dampen fears that relaxed licensing laws have been contributing to rising drinking levels, they will also give rise to concerns that the trend could see the closure of yet more pubs, ripping the heart out of communities. The British Beer &amp; Pub Association's Statistical Handbook reveals that last year the average adult drank eight litres of alcohol, compared with 8.2 the year before, a 3.3% fall. The drop in consumption continues a steady decline from a peak of 9.5 litres in 2004. But while alcohol consumption has been falling, the number of breweries has increased, with 1,113 now operating in Britain, 165 more than in the previous year. Cask ale continues to increase its market share, a trend attributed to tax concessions given to new breweries under the last government. The handbook records that the average price of a pint of draught lager now stands at \u00a33.30, up from \u00a33.19, while draught bitter costs \u00a32.87, up from \u00a32.80. While health experts will view the fall in alcohol consumption as a positive trend, the brewing industry is worried that it could be a threat to jobs. Almost 6,000 pubs have closed in the last year and there are warnings that 4,000 more are at risk. In March, in a sop to the industry, the chancellor George Osborne scrapped the beer duty escalator and announced that the duty would be cut by a penny. But the industry continues to ask whether the level of tax on beer, which currently stands at 61%, remains partly responsible for falling consumption at a time when many people are feeling the pinch, and should therefore be reduced further. \"The continuing fall in alcohol consumption challenges the inaccurate perception that Britain has a general issue with alcohol,\" said Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the BBPA. \"There are specific problems, which require targeted solutions in partnership with the industry. It is positive for the nation that there is a continued increase in the numbers of breweries. At the same time, despite the cut in beer duty, Britain's consumers are still subject to the second-highest tax rates for beer in the European Union \u2013 holding back growth for the wider sector.\" Part of the reason for the decline may be down to the economy. Recessions in the early 1980s and 1990s, for example, prompted a decline in drinking. But there is also a growing awareness of the dangers associated with drinking. Experts have suggested that the Drink Aware campaign has been a factor in shaping the public's attitudes to alcohol consumption. Figures published earlier this year by the Office for National Statistics suggest that heavy drinking is also on the decline. The proportion of men drinking for five or more days a week fell from 23% in 1998 to 16% in 2011, while that of women dropped from 13% to 9%. Heavy drinking, defined as more than eight units on at least one day in the past week for men, and six units for women, was also shown to have fallen. Heavy drinkers among men aged 16-24 fell from 32% in 2007 to 22% in 2011, and among women of the same age from 24% to 18%. The figures also contradict claims that relaxed licensing laws have contributed to a drink-related crime wave. Last month police chiefs called on the government to think again about the laws and called for the creation of \"drunk tanks\" for intoxicated offenders. However, the handbook records that offences for drunkenness fell by 12% in England and Wales during 2012."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
