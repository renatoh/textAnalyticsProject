The influence of REM is apparent throughout in arpeggiated guitar figures written in the style of Peter Buck, and often played by him \u2013 Calamity Song and Down By the Water, in particular, sound like the Georgia band at their top-notch best. It's no retreat, though: the confident swing of opener Don't Carry It All sets the tone for the album, and song for song, this is certainly Meloy's best set since the Decemberists' breakthrough album, Picaresque. Though the craftsmanship is evident \u2013 in the delicacy of the pair of seasonal ballads June Hymn and January Hymn, in the hillbilly-ballad-cum-indierocker Rox in the Box \u2013 it sounds as though Meloy has allowed instinct to supplement his intellect. A relatively understated delight from a band few might have suspected capable of understatement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
