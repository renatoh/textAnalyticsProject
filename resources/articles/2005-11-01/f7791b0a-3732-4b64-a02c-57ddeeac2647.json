It was never this difficult to overtake on the road to Damascus, and by the time I got to Hafod-y-Llan I was starting to take the Lord's name in vain. The irony is, I could have stayed at home. I was driving to Hafod-y-Llan, the National Trust's farm in Snowdonia, to buy some of their magnificent lamb - but I've just heard they deliver. The cuts come in a recycled box, insulated with a soft mix of washed Welsh Mountain, Herdwick and Swaledale fleece. The \u00a375 price tag includes delivery to your door by a courier. And trust me, when you've been on the A470, that'd be cheap at twice the price. Call 01690 713327 (hafodyllan.org.uk) for details. Tea teaser At Parlour in Sketch, the ineffably cool, three-storey tearoom, bar, brasserie, gallery, 'space' and restaurant in London, white tea has nudged green tea off the menu. It's a less processed version of green tea, and has the highest levels of antioxidants and polyphenols, which are thought to protect against certain cancers and heart diseases. It's also as trendy as you like right now. But green tea is fighting back. And with some success: all the exhibitors at this year's Restaurant Show could talk about were the jasmine green tea balls from Suzi Tea. When hot water is added to these walnut-sized balls, they unfurl into pretty green starbursts with iridescent flowers in the middle. Oh, and they've got lots of antioxidants and polyphenols, too.

I recall a family friend watching proudly as his son tasted it for the first time, while the rabbi said, with tears streaming down his face, 'That's bitter, but not as bitter as last year.' But I digress: I'm making a point about horseradish here. Don't save it just for the roast beef. In Austria, for instance, they pair it with pork, and in Russia they eat it with fish. In Roast Figs Sugar Snow (\u00a320, Mitchell Beazley), Diana Henry shows how the world's overlooked cuisines use the same winter produce as we do in the UK, but combine it differently. The book's about more than ingredients, though. It's about winter food to warm the soul, when life slows down - as does the cooking. Read it and eat I know it's deeply unfashionable, but I love Conran restaurants. They have a sense of theatre about them. And the Blueprint Cafe, with its views over the Thames, is no exception. On Tuesday, at the Blueprint's regular Food Book Club, you can look out on London while listening to Sir Terence and Vicki Conran talk about their 2003 food book, Classic Conran. It's a straightforward read that argues against overly tricked-up, try-hard food. Afterwards, you can eat their recipes cooked up by Blueprint's impressive chef, Jeremy Lee.
