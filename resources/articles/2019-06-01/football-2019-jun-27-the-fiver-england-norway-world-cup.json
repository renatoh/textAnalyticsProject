Unless it comes up against better", "bodyText": "PHILGOOD FACTOR Following his team\u2019s painful victory over Cameroon in the last 16, England manager Phil Neville felt so much shame on behalf of his vanquished opponents that he needed to do something radical. He had to find a way of cleansing himself, lest he be deflected from his crusade to make football pure again. Undignified reactions to agonising defeats were never tolerated by Lord Ferg or David Moyes, so Neville would be damned if he was going to let the behaviour of frustrated Cameroonian players stop him from saving football, especially women\u2019s football. Little girls around the world are depending on him! \u201cHelp us, Phil Neville,\u201d they say like so many tiny Princess Leias. \u201cYou\u2019re our only hope!\u201d So before his team\u2019s showdown with Norway in Thursday\u2019s World Cup quarter-final, Neville decided to visit a French barber. And by the looks of it, that barber used something alarmingly close to a guillotine. \u201cA disaster!\u201d yelped Neville when displaying his new coiffe at the pre-game press conference. No doubt he must have felt ashamed for the hairdresser. This barnet is going out all across the world and just look at the bloody state of it! \u201cI needed an interpreter,\u201d sniffed Neville, though he managed to come up with a term for the do. \u201cIt\u2019s called a 10-day haircut, which means in 10 days it will be better.\u201d That means it should look wholesome just in time for the World Cup final. Canny Neville! The hair will be ready, the waistcoat is sorted and the tone is high and mighty; now all England have to do is win enough matches to get to the final. It\u2019s four from four so far and Neville sees that hot streak continuing even if Lucy Bronze, Millie Bright and Steph Houghton lose their races to be fit in time to take part against Norway. \u201cI\u2019m a great believer in looking in my players\u2019 eyes,\u201d gabbled Neville, as Pep Guardiola and Arrigo Sacchi rushed for their notebooks. \u201cThe look in their eyes today is relaxed, happy and like they\u2019re ready to win.\u201d That, of course, was the day before the actual match, and possibly before they saw Neville\u2019s haircut. But the manager revealed that his wife, Julie, has lit candles and prayed for his team. And good must prevail. Unless it comes up against better.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cMaybe one of the challenges that we face is we\u2019re not a big glossy charity event, we\u2019re not a corporation. This isn\u2019t a PR exercise. We\u2019re literally asking for people who believe in the project to come join us\u201d \u2013 Equal Playing Field\u2019s Maggie Murphy on plans in Lyon to break the world record for the biggest football match. FIVER LETTERS \u201cI see press reports that Manchester City are going to sign England\u2019s Cricket World Cup psychologist. Presumably we can expect them to finish outside the top four next season\u201d \u2013 Simon Cherry. \u201cI write to protest at your demonstrable ignorance of the superb tiffin that is the Tunnock\u2019s caramel wafer biscuit (yesterday\u2019s Fiver). Your description of them as \u2018chocolate-coated soft marshmallow on a biscuit base\u2019 clearly indicates that you know as much about great British sweet treats as you do about football. Just as Brexit means Brexit, so a teacake is a teacake is not a wafer biscuit (and vice versa or something similar). Numerous supermarket chains have attempted to imitate this edible icon with their own (cheaper) brand versions but my research reveals that none come close to Mr Tunnock\u2019s singular balance of chocolate coating, thin caramel layer, and light yet somehow soft wafer that those not born around 1952 and of a less discerning palate could easily mistake for staleness\u201d \u2013 Ronald Jugg (and 1,056 others). \u201cThank you Fiver for informing me that I was born in the same year as that wonderful Scottish confection Tunnock\u2019s. Moreover, I have just returned from a Fiver-free respite in that wonderful country, and what was there to greet us at our holiday abode but a six-pack of the aforementioned delicacy. And it was gratefully consumed, I can assure you\u201d \u2013 Mike Miles. \u201cOn the subject of nominative determinism (Fiver letters passim), it doesn\u2019t always work. About 40 years ago I was introduced to a man called Arthur Brain and, if memory serves, he was quite intelligent\u201d \u2013 Robert Blanchard. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Egypt\u2019s Mo Salah has rallied behind forward Amr Warda after he was expelled from their Afcon squad following allegations of sexual harassment. \u201cWomen must be treated with the utmost respect,\u201d he tooted. \u201cI also believe that many who make mistakes can change for the better and shouldn\u2019t be sent straight to the guillotine, which is the easiest way out. We need to believe in second chances ... we need to guide and educate. Shunning is not the answer.\u201d Back to nominative determinism and Barcelona have brought in goalkeeper Neto from Valencia. Meanwhile, Bar\u00e7a suit Jordi Cardoner insists the club aren\u2019t trying to bring Neymar back from PSG. \u201cWe have not put that topic on the table,\u201d he sniffed. Liverpool have agreed terms to sign highly-rated Dutch whelp Sepp van den Berg from PEC Zwolle. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it, I thought it was a joke,\u201d honked the defender. Chelsea have money to burn and a transfer ban to wangle themselves around so will splurge \u00a345m on making Mateo Kovacic\u2019s loan a permanent deal. Joe Aribo has done one from Charlton to join the Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019Rangers for around \u00a3300,000, leaving Lee Bowyer in a right funk. \u201cJoe should have stayed in England,\u201d he parped. \u201cBrentford came to us two days ago asking about Joe. They said they tried for him. Joe wasn\u2019t even aware Brentford were interested in him. His [Mr 15%] should have told him. Brentford make players better and then sell them to the Premier League. Joe has done financially well out of this but so has his [Mr 15%].\u201d Decent.
