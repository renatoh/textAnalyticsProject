Besides the attempted murder of the officer, Tyrone Benjamin Henry, who is from east London, has also been accused of being in possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life and being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm. In a statement released on Friday evening, the Metropolitan police said the 31-year-old was due to appear at Thames magistrates\u2019 court on Saturday 17 October. The officer, part of the Met\u2019s Trident gun crime unit, was taken to hospital after being shot in broad daylight in Haggerston. His condition is described as stable. Senior colleagues have paid tribute to the detective\u2019s bravery. Met commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, Britain\u2019s top policeman, said: \u201cThis officer has shown great bravery. His colleagues have described him as \u2018exceptional\u2019 and \u2018professional\u2019. He has been that and more. I am thinking of him and his family and I wish him a quick recovery.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
