It has the right conditions - plenty of nutrients in the soil and enough rain - and has flourished. But it never seems to flower. Why? There are significant differences in the flowers of pampas grasses propagated from seed, so it is always a good idea to buy in late summer, when you can choose a good one. However, they should all produce something. You say it is growing in the right conditions, but don't mention the one thing pampas grass must have to flower well: light. If yours is in a shady spot or has become overcrowded by other plants, it will just produce leaves and no flowers. Try moving it (perhaps in early winter, after cutting down those sharp leaves) or chopping back surrounding plants. Also, the nutrients in the soil may not be sufficient - so, a few times a year, water on a generalpurpose liquid fertiliser. Legal fellers? I live in a conservation area and recently two trees were felled very near my house. One was a 30ft Fatsia japonica, and it was full of nesting birds. Was this act illegal? Anyone wanting to carry out work on trees (defined as having a trunk over 75mm in diameter when measured 1.5m from the ground) in conservation areas must give the local planning authority six weeks' notice. This requirement is designed to give time to assess if the tree should be subject to a tree preservation order (TPO). If planners decide not, any work can go ahead. Trees worked on without assessment are subject to full TPO protection and related fines: up to \u00a320,000 for destroying a tree or \u00a32,500 for carrying out other works. As for the birds, it is an offence to intentionally damage or destroy the nest of any wild bird while it is in use or being built. Plant it now Not all spring bulbs are delicate little things. The 2ft-high flower stalks of Fritillaria 'Maxima Lutea' burst from bare spring soil holding big, yellow, bell-shaped flowers topped by a crown of fresh green bracts. They take a while to get established and may not even flower in their first spring, but patience is rewarded - once established, they are undemanding and a clump of them makes for an impressive sight. Their main requirement is for good, sharp drainage, and on the heaviest soils it is a good idea to plant the bulbs sideways in a bed of gravel. They are happy in full sun or partial shade. \u00b7 Readers can order three large Fritillaria 'Maxima Lutea' bulbs (size 20/24) for \u00a39.95, or nine for \u00a324.85. Price includes UK mainland p&amp;p. Call 0870 836 0908, quoting ref GUPW46. Delivery will be in mid-September. \u00b7 Send your gardening queries to space@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
