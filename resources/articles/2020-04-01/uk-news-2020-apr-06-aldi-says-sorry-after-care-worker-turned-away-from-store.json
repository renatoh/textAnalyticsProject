Marion Kilmurray posted a plea on Facebook for care workers to be treated as frontline workers, alleging that she was turned back from an Aldi on Sunday in Wishaw, North Lanarkshire, when trying to get bread for one of the women she cares for. In response to the allegation, an Aldi spokesperson denied Kilmurray had been turned away. \u201cCarers are very welcome at all of our stores and we recognise the vital role they play in our local communities. Mrs Kilmurray wasn\u2019t turned away from our Wishaw store so we are looking into what may have happened and are trying to contact her,\u201d a spokesperson said. The video was shared more than 100,000 times, but on Monday evening Kilmurray took it down from her Facebook page. In the clip Kilmurray, sitting in her car in her carer\u2019s blue uniform, claimed: \u201cI went in to get bread for an elderly woman who can\u2019t come out of the house because she has to self-isolate and I can\u2019t get her bread because my uniform doesn\u2019t count.\u201d In tears she said: \u201cDo you think I want to be out here working? I\u2019m trying to raise a family \u2026 I\u2019m risking my life and my family\u2019s life so get a grip and somebody do something about this.\u201d Aldi previously announced that emergency workers - those in the NHS, police and fire service - will receive priority access at any time of the day with appropriate ID, such as an NHS card. This means they can enter the store as soon as social distancing limits allow. Aldi stores are also now opening half an hour earlier on Sunday mornings for emergency workers only."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
