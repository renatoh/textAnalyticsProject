In a central plank of plans to cut the deficit, the government is capping the annual bill for tax credits and housing benefit to \u00a3119.5bn this year \u2013 despite forecasts that millions of people face rocketing rent charges and low wage rises. The cap, which does not apply to spending on pensions or out of work benefits, is to be extended to 2018-19 by a charter that will go before parliament next week. The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, said that Labour would vote in favour. Faiza Shaheen, a senior researcher at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, said the cap appeared driven by ideology rather than any bid to tackle the underlying causes of welfare dependency. Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR), said the welfare cap was no more than a gesture and kicked the problem of spending cuts into the next parliament. \"Putting a number on the welfare cap without policies to deliver it is meaningless. If you are going to take money away from people you need to change policy and there is nothing to tell us how the cuts will be achieved.\" Portes also derided the charter committing MPs to renewing the cap each year. \"It is a gesture and no more meaningful than that. Parliament already votes on measures to change social security budgets, so a charter makes little real difference,\" he said. Treasury forecasts show the bulk of the government's deficit reduction plans are to avoid tax rises in favour of attacks on social security spending. Ministers expect to impose \u00a32bn of tax rises in 2015-16 compared to \u00a321bn of welfare savings. Osborne's welfare spending cap pushes the ratio of spending cuts to tax rises above 90% \u2013 higher than the government's stated 80% limit \u2013 although taking into account tax rises from the beginning of the parliament the Treasury said the 80% limit remained in place. Welfare spending accelerated in the years before the crash as Labour increased tax credit payments and the housing benefit bill jumped. Current forecast spending of \u00a3119bn for 2015-16 is set to fall within the cap, which will rise in line with inflation to \u00a3127bn in 2018-19. The elements of welfare spending that fall under the cap have increased by 58%, or \u00a345 billion, since 2000-01. Criticism of the welfare cap came as Osborne was forced to admit that his deficit reduction programme would not be significantly helped by higher than expected growth. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) lifted its forecast for GDP growth in 2014 to 2.7%, from the 2.4% predicted in December's autumn statement and 1.8% forecast at the time of last year's budget. Recovery is forecast to continue for the next four years, speeding up a little in the first couple of years before settling back to the long term trend of 2.5% by 2018. Yet this solid performance results in a limited reduction in public sector borrowing this year to \u00a3107.8bn, from \u00a3111.2bn on the OBR's last estimate. Thereafter, the forecast for the underlying deficit was trimmed just \u00a3500m to \u00a395.5bn in 2014-15, before falling more sharply to \u00a375.2bn in 2015-16, \u00a344.5bn in 2016-17 and an expected surplus of \u00a34.8bn in 2018/19. Osborne said the faster fall in borrowing would free up \u00a324bn over the next five years that otherwise would have been added to the \u00a31.24tn trillion debt built up since the financial crash. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"The government borrowing and debt forecasts are still horribly high, but they do look a lot better than they did in March 2013 and even modestly better than they did in last December's autumn statement.\" Michael Saunders, UK economist at Citi, said the OBR forecasts could prove to be conservative and the deficit could fall faster than expected. But he warned that the plan relied on the planned welfare cuts being pushed through, which he said was going to cause a huge battle inside and outside parliament. \"If the post-election fiscal consolidation is implemented, then the UK's fiscal deficit should fall markedly further in coming years, with a surplus in prospect towards the end of the decade. \"However, there are major political risks over this scenario, reflecting uncertainties over whether the post-2015 spending squeeze is politically deliverable, especially if the 2015 election produces a Labour-led majority or coalition government,\" he said. James Meadway, senior economist at the New Economics Foundation (NEF) said the need to make huge cuts in welfare to meet deficit targets was detached from reality when four out of five new jobs created were in low-paid sectors and 80% of new jobs are in London. \"Instead of real action to tackle falling real incomes and insecure employment, Osborne has once again concentrated on handouts for the least deserving. While the grinding programme of spending cuts continues, including a permanent welfare cap, big businesses will get tax breaks. Mike Turley, head of public sector at Deloitte, the business advisory firm, said any future government would need to focus on welfare spending to make the public finances more sustainable. \"Care does need to be taken, however, to ensure that capping welfare spending does not lead to increased costs elsewhere in the public sector. \"Targeting certain benefits could add pressure to spending on education, social services, housing and policing, so the danger is that costs are simply displaced. \"Building in accountability on welfare spending and ensuring that, if a future government breaches the cap, a statement will need to be made to parliament, adds some welcome governance into the system.\" The latest figures for January from the Office for National Statistics showed a surplus of \u00a34.7bn, which was less than the \u00a36bn surplus recorded in the same month a year earlier. Experts blamed lower tax receipts, but the OBR said it expected stronger than expected growth to play a part in meeting its more optimistic targets for this year and next."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
