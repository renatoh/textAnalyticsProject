Xhaka will not travel to Leicester for Saturday evening\u2019s fixture, meaning he will miss a fourth consecutive match since his stormy departure from the Emirates Stadium pitch against Crystal Palace in October. He was relieved of the captaincy this week and Emery floated the possibility he may have played his final match for the club. \u201cAs a coach I have a responsibility for the team: we need a player like Granit Xhaka,\u201d Emery said. \u201cBut also, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to play [for us] again. I don\u2019t know because, if he is available in his mind to continue helping us and continue defending the Arsenal shirt, I think time is giving us that solution. Then, if I decide he is in the group with us, if he is ready and 100% in his mind with the decision to help us \u2013 we have a solution.\u201d While Emery was emphatic in stating Xhaka\u2019s absence is \u201cmy decision, 100%\u201d, he has had little option but to make that call given the Switzerland international has made his own feelings clear. \u201cHe said to me that he is not available yet to play; not Wednesday [the 1-1 draw at Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es], not tomorrow,\u201d he said. Even if the wider ramifications are yet to become entirely clear, losing Xhaka deals Emery a significant short-term problem. Dani Ceballos, who limped off in Guimar\u00e3es, will miss the Leicester game and Arsenal are running out of recognised first-team midfielders. \u201cAfter Ceballos\u2019s injury we have one less player to use in midfield and we now don\u2019t really have a lot of players in this position,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important now to [continue] without Granit Xhaka but I don\u2019t know; maybe he can play in the future, maybe he can\u2019t play.\u201d Arsenal are already making plans for the latter scenario and, when asked whether he had spoken to the club about the eventuality of Xhaka moving on in January and requiring a replacement, Emery said: \u201cYes, I asked that question. The club knows the player\u2019s decision at any moment, and my decision or idea about that situation and the circumstances.\u201d It is hardly outlandish to think Xhaka will seek a transfer as soon as the window opens but the head coach would not say whether the player had asked to leave. \u201cI am not thinking about that because we are going to play a lot of matches in November and December,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot change him in that two months.\u201d Emery was reflective on the subject of Arsenal\u2019s season, which feels on a knife-edge going into a meeting with Brendan Rodgers\u2019 third-placed side. A defeat would put them nine points behind Leicester and recent performances have offered little encouragement the gap will be narrowed. But Emery pointed out a pile-up of what, in his eyes, are mitigating off-field factors that have weighed Arsenal down beyond Xhaka\u2019s spat with the fanbase, including the August departure of the former captain Laurent Koscielny and the carjacking incident that beset Mesut \u00d6zil and Sead Kolasinac shortly before the campaign began. \u201cI\u2019m not really disappointed with our work,\u201d he said. \u201cI am being realistic because some circumstances did not help us to achieve the best emotional balance. \u00d6zil\u2019s circumstances, Kolasinac, Laurent Koscielny\u2019s circumstance. Remember also that, if he was here, the captain would be Koscielny and that would give us no problem. Then also, Xhaka\u2019s circumstance.\u201d He accepted Arsenal \u201cdidn\u2019t impose as I want\u201d his plans in recent games, though, and cited the Leicester game as an ideal opportunity to put things right. David Luiz and the new captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, will both return to the starting lineup after being rested in midweek and there may well be a second consecutive league appearance for \u00d6zil, who was one of the better performers in the draw with Wolves last Saturday. \u201cThe most important thing is our mentality and going there thinking \u2018We are Arsenal\u2019\u201d he said, and such an attitude will be crucial given that his team have been cast as outsiders to win the game. \u201cWe will go there with confidence and also strong in our mentality to be together and go to work against them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
