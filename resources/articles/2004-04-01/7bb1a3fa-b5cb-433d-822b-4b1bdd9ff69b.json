A promising omen is that Sir Bobby Robson has lost only once in this competition in 15 ties over the decades and a 0-0 draw next week would put Newcastle through on the away-goal rule. Having fallen behind in the 15th minute to Mateja Kezman's fine strike, Newcastle replied via the head of Jermaine Jenas seconds before half-time - Jenas was in the side because Kieron Dyer was injured. They pump out the theme from Batman whenever Kezman scores here and next week he could be partnered by Arjen Robben. The \u00a313million Chelsea-bound winger should be fit for the return, so Newcastle need to be cautious. But this was a tight, tenacious performance by Robson's team who survived a lot of PSV attacking. Kezman was central to the Eindhoven threat and will have to be watched carefully. The evening had begun with a chorus of \"There's only one Bobby Robson\" from the PSV fans massed behind Shay Given's goal. The hospitality ended there, and soon. Just 53 seconds in and Mark van Bommel, the PSV captain and a midfielder linked with at least six English clubs over the past two years, began a surge into Given's area that ended with Van Bommel spreadeagled under challenge from Titus Bramble. The crowd cried penalty but the referee Gilles Veissi\u00e8re waved play on. Less than a minute later Olivier Bernard had to make a crunching tackle, also on Van Bommel, so the Dutch start was a lively one. Remco van der Schaaf, included at the expense of Johann Vogel, had been given the task of patrolling in front of PSV's defence with a brief to get as close to Alan Shearer and Craig Bellamy as he could. Van der Schaaf did this with such enthusiasm that he was in the book after 12 minutes. It was the beginning of an eventful night for Van der Schaff, later elbowed by Bramble. That could have interrupted Eindhoven but the flow of red and white stripes charging forward continued. That is not Newcastle's favourite kit of course, but courtesy of a mistake by Aaron Hughes, New castle still did them a favour. Following a flick from one of the biggest names in world football, Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink, Hughes was muscled off the ball by Kezman. Kezman looked up and saw he was on the edge of the Newcastle box. With Bramble failing to close down the space before Kezman, the Yugoslav took aim. Kezman is good at that, this was his 20th goal of the season and hence the sustained interest in his future. It was a curled shot that sailed over the outstretched fingers of Given and into the top corner. Instead of rocking, with Jonathan Woodgate bringing some much needed assurance, Newcastle settled after that. Moving forward, Gary Speed had a 30-yard shot tipped over by Ronald Waterreus, Shearer missed with a difficult volley and eight minutes before the interval Hughes almost atoned for his error with a run and cross that Shearer met six yards out. Once again Waterreus sprang into action to make a save. But after another foul from Van der Schaaf, Newcastle equalised. It was first-half injury time when Laurent Robert stroked across the subsequent free-kick and Jenas rose highest to nod in his third goal of the season. Newcastle had another good one four minutes into the second half when Wilfred Bouma headed a John de Jong corner onto the crossbar with Given seemingly beaten, then another when Mr. Veissiere ignored a PSV claim that Jenas handled in the area. PSV were in the ascendancy just as at the same period in the first half and Newcastle were being forced deep into their own territory. The visitors began to show greater efficiency now and it was the 66th minute before a spectacular overhead kick from Kezman worried Given again. A Darren Ambrose shot into the side netting broke the pattern of constant Dutch pressure, but Kezman continued to apply more with a sharp shot that hit Given rather than the Irishman saving it. Newcastle's job is half-done."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
