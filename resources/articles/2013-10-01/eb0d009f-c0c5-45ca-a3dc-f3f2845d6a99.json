Time-travelling back to lost works", "bodyText": "A hopeful glance at a dusty shelf in a TV station in Nigeria, and suddenly we have restored to us nine lost episodes from the earliest days of Doctor Who, where the doctor is still Patrick Troughton and odd things occur on the underground. Such treasures do come to light now and then, mostly by accident \u2013 a lost Hancock's Half Hour might lurk in some Sunderland cellar, a lost Goon Show in an attic in Accrington \u2013 but these belong to recent art forms. What's been lost in literature and music going back to the earliest times is greatly more grievous: some 80 plays by Aeschylus, it has been computed, and two-thirds of the output of Aristotle. Perhaps Agathon was a greater writer than either \u2013 but not one word of him now remains. In later times, along with what has simply been lost, or even stolen, like Michael Berkeley's opera Jane Eyre \u2013 its only copy whipped from his car \u2013 there are works destroyed by their writers (Dr Johnson, Gibbon, Gogol), eradicated by hostile authority, or, like Byron's memoirs or those of the great eroticist Burton, deemed too rude for the public to see and burned by friends or relatives. There's always a lingering hope that not all declared lost has vanished for ever. Dante Gabriel Rossetti, on the suicide of his wife, had a volume of his poems buried with her; later, he dug them up again. But as for Aristotle, Aeschylus and poor Agathon, only one chance now remains. Here, the kind of search that succeeded in Nigeria plainly requires a time traveller. A job for Doctor Who, indisputably."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
