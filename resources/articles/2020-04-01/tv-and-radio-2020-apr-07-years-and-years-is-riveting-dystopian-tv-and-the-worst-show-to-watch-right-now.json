The action begins in 2019 and propels the characters forward at a rapid pace into an unstable future in which Donald Trump gets a second term and ignorant populists are in charge everywhere, it\u2019s too late to reverse the impacts of global heating, and the economy is collapsing. Not having seen it last year, I thought I would watch it while on lockdown during this global pandemic. My advice to you is: don\u2019t make my mistake. Don\u2019t watch this show right now. It is well acted, the story is engaging and the Lyons family at the heart of the drama is compelling and sympathetic \u2013 but now is not the time to watch this show. The central conceit of Years and Years \u2013 how society might collapse over the course of 15 years (from 2019 to 2034) \u2013 might have been a terrible portent even from the comfort of calmer times, but makes for deeply stressful and discombobulating viewing when watched during a fast-paced, chaotic and frightening real-life experience of global societal collapse. I watched three episodes of the show over the course of two weeks as Covid-19 spread from one country to the next. I had to force myself to continue past episode one. After having read the news all day, refreshing live blogs and even writing about the pandemic myself, the last thing I wanted to do in my downtime was watch a grim dystopian series that actually looks like a more attractive prospect than our current, lived reality. As the Lyons family deals with an uncertain and unstable world, viewers at home, forced to socially isolate \u2013 often away from friends, family and hugs \u2013 are going through their own dystopia. I started episode two, in which there is a run on the banks, in the week when more than 6 million people filed for unemployment in the US and up to a million jobless were predicted in Australia, as overnight dole queues sprung up in otherwise empty streets. That week, I couldn\u2019t watch a full episode. My nervous system said \u201cno\u201d. The similarities pile up. Emma Thompson \u2013 in one of the show\u2019s strongest performances \u2013 plays populist politician Viv Rook, who\u2019s more entertainer than politician. At one rally she can\u2019t explain what an \u201cexport tariff\u201d is, but creates a distraction by brandishing a device that has the power to shut down everyone\u2019s mobile phone. Meanwhile, in real life, Donald Trump contradicts scientists, touts unproven miracle cures for Covid-19 and has compared the deadly virus to a seasonal flu. An asylum seeker character in episode two of Years and Years is deported without warning or due process, while on the actual news entire countries seal off their borders and the economic fate of undocumented workers or workers on tourist or bridging visas looks dire. Over the decade and a half depicted on Years and Years, technology improves (you can plant your phone in your hand), species die out (there are no butterflies any more), a character succumbs to a slow death by radiation poisoning from nuclear fallout, and a successful banker loses his job and enters the gig economy, working as many as eight different jobs. Meanwhile, in our real lives, each night on the news is another horror story: cruise ships are denied port and must keep sailing while people aboard get infected and die; the only sounds in Manhattan are birdsong on empty streets and the wail of ambulance sirens; hospitals are overwhelmed and do not have enough ventilators or masks, and those with the virus are often dying alone for fear of infecting others. The rest of us are isolated in our houses, working from home (if we\u2019re lucky enough to have jobs), denied the social contact and normal family life enjoyed by the Lyons family on the show \u2013 even with their dire political and economic situation. When it premiered on BBC in June last year, a Guardian review headlined \u201cFuture shock\u201d read: \u201cIt remains likely that some, if not most, of the eerie forecasts contained within this drama will never happen. Rather than disappearing beneath the waves, the UK may yet build a new Jerusalem. But if the worst does happen, Years and Years will have served as good preparation.\u201d It\u2019s a good show, but it hasn\u2019t been good preparation. Watch it when this is all over for some light relief. Right now, we are living in a dystopia beyond even the most fantastic imagining. \u2022 Years and Years is a six-part drama series available for streaming on SBS, if you dare"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
