For Richard Caborn and the four officials who accompanied him to the Bavarian city, there was little time to take in the festive atmosphere or stop and listen to the carols echoing in the background. It is what might happen in 2012 that concerns Caborn and his superior Tessa Jowell as they finalise a proposal on whether or not London should bid for the Olympic Games. Munich was the last stop on Caborn's tour of former and future Olympic host cities which has so far taken in Moscow, Sydney and the 2004 city Athens. Jowell has visited Barcelona and Beijing and between them and the posse of civil servants that accompany them they must come up with a proposition that will be put to the cabinet by the end of next month on whether or not London should try and stage the 2012 games. During his talks with Munich city officials Caborn made it clear that the British government was not prepared to back a 2012 bid if Olympic venues were not used on a long-term basis once the games are over. Caborn is also keen to avoid some of the mistakes that have been made by some of the former host cities, such as Montreal, who have built expensive Olympic venues only to find that once the games are over they are left empty and desolate with the local or national government picking up the bill to ensure their surivival. During his trip to Sydney, the 2000 hosts in an Olympics widely considered the most successful ever, Caborn was told that it is still costing \u00a310m per year of public money just to maintain the city's Olympic facilities which are under-used while the former Olympic complex has turned into a barren area rarely visited on the edge of the city. The key word for the government and Caborn appears to be \"legacy\" and ensuring that once the games are over, Olympic facilities do not go to waste as they have done in former host cities. Caborn appeared particularly interested in the wider effects the Olympic Games has had on regenerating a northern part of Munich that 30 years ago had few facilities and was not very pleasant on the eye. The government envisages that the Olympics will have a similar effect on east London and will help to rebalance the economy of London by creating jobs, houses and new facilities in what has traditionally been a run-down and neglected part of the capital. One of the biggest problems facing the government over a London 2012 bid is the capital's chaotic road and public transport system. The government estimates that the cost of staging the games alone and building new venues will be between \u00a32bn to \u00a32.5bn. However, that amount could very well double once new roads and rail lines are constructed and a possible cross-rail link built across the centre of London. The government is to examine ways of bringing other agencies into the Olympic equation from an early stage so that it becomes clear who will use the facilities once the games are over and ensure that they do not run at a loss. One of the suggestions is that East London University could take up the running of a number of the venues while a professional football club might move into the new Olympic stadium to guaranteee revenue. If an athletes village is constructed then this could be turned into affordable housing once the games are over. Speculation is already rife that Tottenham Hotspur might be interested in moving to a possible new Olympic stadium and Caborn has made it clear that should it be built then ensuring that it continues to generate revenue once the games are over will be a priority. During yesterday's visit to Munich's Olympic Park, where the 1972 games took place, Caborn was informed that its venues now run at a loss of between six million to eight million euros per year and the entire complex is reliant on subsidies from the city council to ensure its financial survival. The former Olympic village in Munich has been converted partly into student accommodation while a number of other flats were sold off privately. The main Olympic stadium is used by Munich's two football clubs, Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich both of whom are moving to a new stadium in 2005. Caborn was told that once Munich was awarded the Olympic games work began on building the city's first subway network while 38km of new roads were built along with 53 bridges. Overall, however, the games made a financial loss and Munich had to rely on handouts from the federal German government while the city government is still subsidising the loss-making Olympic park. All the other former Olympic cities that Caborn visited also made a loss and many are still subsidising expensive facilities that were only used for the duration of the games. Caborn said: \"We have to make sure that we do things differently and that's why I have been touring these former Olympic cities with my team to see how we can avoid the mistakes that they make. Clearly, we would love to have the Olympics but we have to make sure that there is a long lasting legacy so that the whole community benefits. \"It's no use building fantastic facilities that just become sporting museums that are never used as has happened in Sydney.\" Wilfrid Spronk, general manager of Munich's Olympic park complex told Caborn: \"You must make sure that your sports facilities have a longer term use. The problem in the past has been that venues were only built for two weeks to show the world that we are fantastic. That is what we had in Germany in 1972 and they have turned out to be very expensive mounuments.\" The government's ad hoc committee which is made up of a number of ministries meets next week to discuss a possible 2012 bid. A second meeting will take place in the third week of January with the final decision being made by cabinet. Following his trips, Caborn appears keen on an Olympic bid but his message is clear; they cannot come to London in 2012 at any cost and there must be long-term sustainable use of all Olympic facilities to improve east London. If the government feels it can match this criteria then the next two years should prove to be among the most enthralling in the history of British sport as London attempts to secure the 2012 Olympic Games. The big six leading the bidding for 2012 London Pluses: one of the world's great cities. Large Anglophile support within IOC. Twice helped the Olympic movement by staging the games of 1908 and 1948 when other cities could not host them. Minuses: perceived lack of government support. Wembley and Picketts Lock fiascos still fresh in the memory. Antiquated transport system. Celebrity supporters: Princess Royal, Sir Steven Redgrave. Chances: among favourites. Paris Pluses: the world's No1 tourist site. Has not staged the games since 1924 and boasts some strong support from the French government. Minuses: many of sites originally earmarked for 2008 Games are no longer available. Concerns over transport. Celebrity supporters: Jacques Chirac, Zinedine Zidane. Chances: the favourite, but the favourite rarely wins. New York Pluses: strong emotional pull after the events of September 11 last year. The self-styled capital city of the world. Innovative bid, support of American TV. Minuses: strong anti-American feeling within IOC. Concerns about security. Fresh memories of the 1996 games in Atlanta - the worst in history. Celebrity supporters: Rudolph Giuliani, Woody Allen, Robert De Niro. Chances: will attract plenty of interest but is big outsider. Moscow Pluses: Russia remains an important nation within the Olympic movement and it has staged the games only once, back in 1980. Minuses: Chechen rebels might target the event. A high crime rate as well as a poor financial situation will not help either. It is also unlikely that the IOC would want to go there immediately after Beijing. Celebrity supporters: Vladimir Putin. Chances: could be the dark horse if Paris and London split vote. D\u00fcsseldorf Pluses: the favourite of five German cities fighting to be allowed to bid, the city in the Ruhr valley has excellent infrastructure. Minuses: even the Germans admit that this is an unattractive bid. Celebrity supporters: None. Chances: none. Rio de Janeiro Pluses: the Olympics have never been held in South America so Rio would certainly be an attractive option for the IOC to consider. Minuses: Brazil's economic situation may scupper a bid before it even reaches the IOC. Celebrity supporters: Pele, Ronaldo. Chances: if the games are not to be awarded to a European nation then Rio has an excellent chance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
