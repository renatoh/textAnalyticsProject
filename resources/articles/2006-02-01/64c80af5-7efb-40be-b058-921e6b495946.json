The articles appeared on Monday and Tuesday. On the third day G2 ran four pages devoted mostly to contrary opinion, strongly rejecting any such analogy, but including several voices broadly supporting the correspondent's contention that it was a theme worth exploring. Almost all of these opinion pieces, for and against, came from within Israel itself and were submitted to the Guardian by invitation. Throughout the exercise the response from readers was monitored by a senior member of the features staff. Her view, which I share, is that the more controversial the issue covered by the paper's reporting, the greater the obligation to provide space for response and argument. The report was the cover story of G2 on Monday, with the whole of the front page devoted to juxtaposed pictures of a Palestinian in East Jerusalem and a black South African, each holding his identity documents. On the opening spread, at the beginning of the 12 inside pages devoted to this first article, the heading read, in part, \"... even within Israel itself, accusations persist that the web of controls affecting every aspect of Palestinian life bears a disturbing resemblance to apartheid\". This - the persistence of comparisons by people with experience of both societies - was, it seemed to me, well established in McGreal's account. So was his difficulty in eliciting comment, and in some cases, relevant information from the Israeli government. McGreal himself has considerable experience of both societies. He spent 12 years reporting from South Africa, a period which included the last four years of apartheid. In 2002 he moved to his present post. I asked him how his commitment to this inquiry - something that he has been working on intermittently for perhaps 18 months - came about. \"I certainly did not arrive in Israel with preconceived ideas,\" he told me, \"although I was aware even then that the apartheid analogy had been around. But I didn't see any parallel. Israel seemed a very different kind of place.\" It was, he said, his day by day experience that began to turn him towards serious consideration of the idea - the contrast brought home to him on crossing from West Jerusalem, where he lived, into East Jerusalem, \"the huge disparity between the two\". In particular, he says, he became aware of the way in which the law, in such matters as residency for instance, was being used for the benefit of one section of the population and the disadvantage of another. \"I learned day by day, and it began to grow on me that there were parallels to be drawn or at least explored. And at the same time I became aware that there was definitely a taboo around the issue.\" He did not, in his two articles, draw conclusions. Neither have the leader columns of the Guardian offered any comment. McGreal's intention, and this was clearly endorsed by the Guardian in publishing the articles, was to open the subject to debate. The invited responses published on Wednesday were led by a piece, broadly condemnatory of the McGreal articles, by Benjamin Pogrund, the former deputy editor of the Rand Daily Mail in Johannesburg, but resident for the last eight years in Israel where he works to encourage dialogue across political and ethnic lines. He thought the comparisons made or suggested in the articles were largely invalid. If there was a core complaint in the responses taking issue with McGreal, it was that he had not placed sufficient emphasis on security as a motivation for some of the measures taken by Israel referred to in his articles - the easiest example being the security wall/fence. On Tuesday the Guardian letters page led on correspondence responding to the articles, again starting with a letter that was highly critical of them, and going further to say that \"in Britain attacking Israel is an acceptable proxy for anti-semitism\". By Wednesday more than 100 letters on the subject had been directed at the page, with roughly three endorsing the decision to deal with the subject, to every two against, most of the latter rejecting any apartheid analogy. More than 100 readers made their views known to a special mailbox set up by G2, and by midday on Wednesday, the ratio there was about three to one in support of the decision to air the debate. Many applauded McGreal for his \"courage\", a word that cropped up quite often, and congratulated the Guardian for publishing the articles. \u00b7 Email: reader@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
