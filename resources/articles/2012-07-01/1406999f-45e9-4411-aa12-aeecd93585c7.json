It was thanks to [team-mate] Laura Marsh's dad. I must have been 11 or 12 and I was playing a game in Sussex. The keeper just did not turn up, literally did not turn up, and he said: 'Could you fill in for the day?' I thought: 'Yeah, this looks like a bit of fun'. Was it apparent you were good straight away or did you develop over time? It was more the case that I was OK in the field and then all of a sudden with the gloves on I was involved all the time. I love it, I love it, you're not taking the gloves off me! You've been described as a genius. Do you feel like a genius? No! It's flattering, I guess. If they're talking about sport, I'll take it. If they're talking about real life, they don't know me at all! What's the secret of the team's success? Our team spirit. We back any one of us, even No11, to get a hundred. We fight to the death for each other. Can you build team spirit or do you have to get on naturally? I think you can build it. The management have helped the team a lot and they really buy into it. If there's an issue we get it sorted straight away. But it does help that we all get on so well. Women's cricket is a small community so you tend to get to know people and get on with them. And if there's any gossip you soon know about it! You also seem to know how to celebrate properly? There's your team spirit! We pride ourselves that we work really hard, so we play hard as well. The last night on tour, that's our good night. Do the team get the credit they deserve? Yeah, I think so. Over time we've had more coverage and more funding. I think that's due to everything we've done. If we continue it will hopefully get even better. What's been your career highlight? As a team, definitely winning the World Cup in 2009. Personally my hundred at Lord's in 2008 and the partnership with Caroline Atkins [the two put on 268 for the first wicket against South Africa, still a world record]. Can't beat that at Lord's. What would you rather win: the Ashes, the World Cup or the World T20? Putting one over on the Aussies is always great, but I think I'd take the World Cup. You've been blogging for Sky Sports. How did that come about and how do you find it? I was just asked to do that and obviously said yes. I love doing it. I'm quite a sarcastic person so it can be quite hard to relay that on the page, but I really enjoy it. You got a tattoo in New Zealand last year \u2013 are you going to end up like Jade Dernbach with tattoos all over your arms? Could you imagine? That'd be awful. No I'm not. That was a personal thing for me. I didn't believe anyone who said tattoos could be addictive, but I'm already planning another one. You're an Arsenal fan \u2026 Gooner. Absolute Gooner. Who's your favourite player? Well it was F\u00e1bregas till he left. I'm a big Wilshere fan, but it has to be the The Ox. Yeah, The Ox. What was the last song or album you bought? Chris Brown \u2013 Don't Wake Me Up. The album was Carrie Underwood. You don't have to put that in \u2026 What's your favourite film? Shawshank, definitely. What was the last boxset you bought? It was [thinks] \u2026 seasons 1-11 of Family Guy. How many pairs of shoes have you got? Proper shoes or trainers? Proper shoes. Carrie Bradshaw shoes Too many. Around 25 pairs, I think. Too many heels. Cheese or chocolate? [Quick as a flash] Chocolate! Every time. I'm a big Lindt fan. But a Viennesse truffle from Thorntons, that's my downfall. What's your favourite tipple? Jack Daniels. Yep, whisky girl. Do you get ID'd? I do. My baby face. Quite often actually. I'm taking it as a compliment. Who's the most famous person in your mobile? I know him quite well so it doesn't really feel like he's famous: Matt Prior. What have you got in your pockets? My iPhone and my headphones to listen to my iPhone. Thanks for your time, Sarah No problem, Small Talk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
