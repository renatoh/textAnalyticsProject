But this is a band whose sparkling 2004 debut, Hot Fuss, sold 5m copies because it was bursting with indie-disco stompers; it seems unlikely weight is uppermost in their fans' requirements. The downside of this rather overblown approach is Brandon Flowers' newly deepened vocal quaver (think Meatloaf), which he uses to warble lyrics that aren't nearly as profound as he thinks they are. But the band take some pleasing sonic swerves, with the core FM-rock giving way to oompah breakdowns, string flourishes and ELO-styled singalongs. Ultimately, though, Sam's Town succeeds because the changes have not come at the expense of the tunes. The album doesn't lend Flowers the gravitas he apparently yearns for, but it does prove that few are better at irrepressible pop hooks and fist-pumping choruses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
