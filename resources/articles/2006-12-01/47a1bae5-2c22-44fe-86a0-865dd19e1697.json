The flower spikes should be left to dry so the seeds ripen for an ongoing crop. Highgrove is an organic garden and hostas are kept in remarkable condition without chemicals. By establishing a balanced ecosystem, slugs and snails are eaten by predators. The most common killer of tree ferns is the drying out of the trunks. Keep them damp - even in winter. The evergreen leaves of the hart's-tongue fern, Asplenium scolopendrium, are renewed each spring. Humus-rich, preferably alkaline soil keeps them in good condition. It is vital to allow light to get through to the plants; ideal trees, therefore, are ones with open canopies, such as birch, gleditsia and this rowan. When the Duke of Edinburgh first laid eyes upon the stacked-up tree roots of the Highgrove \"stumpery\", he turned to Prince Charles and said, \"When are you going to set fire to this lot?\" In fact, the Woodland Garden at Highgrove holds many surprises, the most magical being the stumpery. This mysterious construction owes its roots, so to speak, to the Victorian obsession with ferns, and there are very few examples still surviving today. The prince originally commissioned the stumpery as a home for his collection of hostas, although it is now also colonised by ferns, euphorbias and hellebores, which thrive in the dappled shade of this open woodland. A stumpery is essentially old roots - in this case sweet chestnuts, which are stacked up and held in place with steel reinforcing rods. The end result quickly blends with the surroundings and provides an ideal habitat for plants which can nestle in the nooks and crannies formed by the roots. Tree stumps are usually very dense and take a long time to rot, but as they start to decompose they become a haven for wildlife, playing host to everything from stag beetles to toads and small mammals. All play a part in creating a balanced ecosystem in this garden."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
