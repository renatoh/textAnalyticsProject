It will be the first time the 21-year-old Ford has been picked to start a Test at fly-half and a fresh chapter in the history of English rugby is about to begin. As well as nudging out Farrell to inside-centre, Ford will take over the goal-kicking duties against Samoa, with Stuart Lancaster inviting him to stake his claim to be the starting 10 at next year\u2019s Rugby World Cup on home soil. \u201cPlaying them both is something we wanted to look at and now is the time to do it,\u201d the coach said. \u201cThis is George\u2019s chance to put his marker down to be the number one 10 in the country.\u201d Ever since Ford was voted the IRB\u2019s world junior player of the year in 2011 there has been a sense of inevitability he would start a Test one day. Even Farrell, who lived next door as a kid and used to ask Ford to do his French homework to increase the time the pair had available to practise their rugby, always knew the moment would come, if not quite how it has turned out. It was Farrell\u2019s under-par display in last weekend\u2019s 31-28 defeat against South Africa that has opened the door for his long-time friend, who made little attempt to disguise his delight at getting the nod. \u201cI\u2019m really proud to be starting my first game for England at Twickenham,\u201d said Ford, who made his professional debut at 16. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a great opportunity for me at 10.\u201d Both players are sons of former Wigan and Great Britain rugby league players but Lancaster went out of his way to make clear that Andy Farrell, England\u2019s backs coach, has never had the final say over whether his son plays for England. \u201cTo suggest he in anyway would influence selection is completely wrong,\u201d Lancaster said. The coach is hopeful the childhood friends will increase England\u2019s tactical options behind the scrum after defeats to the All Blacks and the Springboks. \u201cThese two are lads who have grown up together. We\u2019re not talking about two strangers meeting on a rugby field. They\u2019ve played age-grade rugby together and played in a junior World Cup final. It\u2019s not a new relationship.\u201d He is also backing Ford to improve the team\u2019s attacking game. \u201cIt\u2019s about learning whether George can run the game from 10, kick the goals and feel the pressure. You can\u2019t go into a World Cup with only one guy having played at 10. I don\u2019t want to put any labels on him but, as a team, I think we should be excited about the young players coming through.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
