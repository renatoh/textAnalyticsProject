It would all be complimentary, of course. We would make sure that his whole party is very well looked after.\" Such is the happy position in which Oxx finds himself after Sea The Stars hinted at true greatness in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown on Saturday. Sea The Stars has now won three Group One races this year, at three different distances, both against his own age group and against older horses. He is, beyond doubt, the hottest property in European racing, the horse that everyone wants. Sheikh Mohammed is strongly rumoured to want Sea The Stars most of all. He is likely to step up his pursuit of the season's outstanding stallion prospect over the next few weeks and a successful bid for the colt could well see his running plans change. In the meantime both Ascot and York \u2013 where the International Stakes in August has been suggested as an alternative to the King George in just under three weeks' time prior to the Irish Champion on 5 September \u2013 will be doing all they can to get Sea The Stars on to their turf. Mick Kinane offered few clues about the colt's likely path yesterday, though he paid tribute yet again to his qualities. \"He has a great presence, the temperament to go with it and he performs likewise,\" the jockey said. \"He's a very unusual character as he takes everything in, enjoys what he's doing and is a bit of a show-off. He's the first horse I've ridden capable of winning a Guineas, a Group One at 10 furlongs and the Derby. He's really a unique horse. \"John [Oxx] and I will sit down this week and speak to the owner. The Irish Champion Stakes would be the main aim but where we go before then we'll just have to see.\" For Ascot in particular an appearance by Sea The Stars would represent a considerable coup. The King George has struggled to attract any three-year-olds at all in recent years, so a Derby winner would be a huge bonus in the first year of Betfair's sponsorship of the race. Nashwan, the last horse to win the Guineas, Derby and Eclipse, went on to win the King George but had a very hard race against Cacoethes in doing so. He then lost his Arc prep and was swiftly retired. Not surprisingly Smith was keen to stress the contrasts between the two colts yesterday. \"One big difference is that John Oxx already seems sceptical about the Arc because of Sea The Stars' going requirements,\" he said. \"At Ascot, barring an act of God, we can guarantee that he will get his ground and there is also an extra three weeks between the King George and Leopardstown compared to the gap they would have if they go to York.\" William Derby, the chief executive at York, is also confident that Sea The Stars would get his ground, at a track where the entire Ebor meeting was washed away last year. \"We have an enthusiastic and know-ledgable crowd at York that really appreciates top-class horses,\" Derby said. \"We're delighted with the way our track project went during the winter and we have new drainage and irrigation systems in place. \"I believe John Oxx has said the horse will tell him when he's ready to run. Let's hope he tells him to come to York.\" The Timeform organisation yesterday declined to offer a preliminary verdict on Sea The Stars' performance in the Eclipse, though for the encouraging reason that this may be \"a rating that is referred to for years\". The implication appears to be that Sea The Stars will be rated as a genuine champion but one with plenty of improvement still to come."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
