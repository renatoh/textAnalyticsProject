But the number of successful prosecutions of waste criminals was down, with 171 last year compared to 249 in 2011-12. Most illegal sites are closed within a year of opening, but rogue disposal firms open up at new locations all the time. Penalties for waste criminals have been toughened. A typical case cited by the agency involved a man from Mytholmroyd, near Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire, who had been operating two sites without permits and with no environmental protections. He was jailed for 25 months, having previously received a suspended sentence for operating a waste transfer station on the same land in 2007. In another incident, a man who allowed 14,000 tyres to be dumped on his Shropshire farm was fined \u00a320,000 and ordered to pay more than \u00a37,000 in costs, and to remove the tyres. The judge said the man had been undercutting legal operators and creating a serious fire risk. Waste crime costs about \u00a31bn a year in harm done to lawful waste businesses, which are undercut by criminals, and the loss of legitimate taxation revenues to the Treasury, without counting the loss of amenity and the cost of clean-ups. Despite the crackdown, only \u00a3800,000 was recovered in fines from April 2012 to March 2013 compared with \u00a31.3m the year before. There was a further \u00a31.3m ordered by the courts in confiscations from waste criminals under the Proceeds of Crime Act, down from \u00a32.2m in 2011-12. The agency's funding is under threat from spending cuts at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). While the agency's illegal waste taskforce will run for two years, future funding for the waste crime crackdown is uncertain. The agency spent \u00a317m on waste crime last year, and has invested \u00a35m over the past 18 months in a taskforce to tackle the problem. The number of closures last year, which includes sites that were converted to comply with the law, was up markedly on the 759 that were shut down in 2011-12. Illegal waste disposal is attractive to companies and individuals because the prices charged are usually far lower than those for legitimate businesses, because the illegal sites do not pay landfill tax. That makes life difficult for legitimate waste disposal businesses, which have been clamouring for the government to assist them, as well as leading to a proliferation of casual dumping of waste, some of it household rubbish but some highly hazardous, in the countryside and at urban locations such as industrial estates, parks or waste land and waterways. Most sites across the country are found on the edges of towns and near major motorways. Side-effects of illegal dumping include pollution, for example from the dumping of chemical drums or oil, and can lead to harmful smoke where waste is burned, as well as infestations of flies and maggots. Much of the waste comes from building sites and home improvements, with construction waste found at more than a quarter of the illegal waste sites closed down. Scrap cars are also a major issue, found at a similar number of sites. Asbestos was found in one in 20 of the illegal dumps, while drums of chemicals, oil or fuel were in a fifth. The Environment Agency listed crimes including illegal exports, serious dumping incidents and sites where waste was burned or buried without any environmental safeguards. Agency officials have begun working more closely with police and collecting tip-offs from local people on where waste is suspected of being disposed of illegally. In 2012-13, the agency dealt with 107 large, serious and organised incidents of waste dumping, down from 262 such incidents the previous year. Metal theft was cut by half on the previous year, with 550 arrests and the seizure of 350 vehicles, as well as searches of 21 shipping containers heading for export that were suspected of containing scrap metal. Ed Mitchell, the director of environment and business at the Environment Agency, said: \"Waste crime puts people and the environment at risk and undermines the legitimate waste industry. We are taking tough action to deal with this problem, through the improved use of intelligence and stronger partnerships with the police and other enforcement bodies. The taskforce has been hugely successful in slashing the number of illegal waste sites operating in England.\" The agency's full report is published on Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
