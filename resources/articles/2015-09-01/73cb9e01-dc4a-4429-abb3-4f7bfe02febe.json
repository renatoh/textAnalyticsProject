Andy Street, speaking as John Lewis opened its 45th store, in Birmingham, said the government\u2019s proposals posed big issues for the retailer. John Lewis is famous for its staff benefits, particularly the annual bonus payout \u2013 worth up to a fifth of annual pay \u2013 and a gold-plated pension. Street\u2019s comments came as Starbucks, the coffee chain, and Amazon, the online retailer, committed to paying the national living wage. Starbucks will also offer interest-free loans to staff so they can pay for a deposit on a rented flat or house. Under the plans of the chancellor, George Osborne, the minimum wage for over-25s will rise from \u00a36.50 an hour to \u00a37.20 in April next year, before rising to at least \u00a39 by 2020. A number of companies, such as Whitbread, the owner of Costa Coffee, have warned that the national living wage could lead to job cuts and price rises. However, other businesses have used it as a catalyst to shake up their pay structure. Lidl, the discounter, will pay all its employees at least \u00a38.20 per hour, which is based on the level estimated by the Living Wage Foundation. Street said the retailer had not \u201cmade any decision yet at all\u201d about how it would adapt to the national living wage, but ruled out cutting the bonus scheme entirely. Street added: \u201cWhat it might lead to is us saying a greater proportion of our rewards to partners goes into base pay other than total benefits. That is up for debate. But will it lead to the scheme of bonus being changed? Categorically no.\u201d The introduction of the national living wage will make little difference next year, Street said, with the huge majority of John Lewis staff already paid about \u00a37.20. However, the long-term impact was unclear. \u201cIf like us you have got a rich benefit scheme with pensions and bonus \u2013 we are paying 15% of our payroll for pensions, 15% for business \u2013 it is obviously quite challenging,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think one of the things I am a little concerned about is that it moves to concentrating on base pay when actually the total reward, and all the richness of that benefit, has distinguished us over time. It is interesting how it will play out with different companies.\u201d The John Lewis Partnership, which also owns Waitrose, is already reviewing its pension scheme after racking up a \u00a31.2bn pension deficit. Street said the national living wage posed a challenge to John Lewis\u2019s policy of setting pay bands for each rank of staff, rather than setting a single figure. This meant that pay could be increased depending on experience and performance. \u201cWe have got a pay policy that has served us very well, it is what drives our outstanding performance from selling partners on the floor,\u201d he said. \u201cSuddenly that is going to change. There are some big issues for us to work through.\u201d Starbucks plans to go further than paying the government\u2019s \u00a37.20 minimum wage when it comes into force next April by offering to help workers struggling to afford sky-high deposits on rented homes. The coffee chain said it would provide employees with an interest-free loan to pay for a deposit on a flat or house, in the first example of this kind of support by a private sector firm. Adopting the Home Sweet Loan scheme developed by the housing charity Shelter, Starbucks will join organisations such as the Co-op group and the Department of Communities and Local Government in offering a loan to staff who otherwise could not afford the deposit when they rent or buy a home. Amazon, John Lewis\u2019s online rival, has upped pay for all permanent staff so they earn at least Osborne\u2019s national living wage, more than six months before it is formally introduced. The online retailer said that, from this month, staff would receive at least \u00a37.20 an hour, up from a minimum of \u00a37.10. The pay rise applies to all staff, including those aged under 25 who are not included in the chancellor\u2019s new minimum wage standard announced in his July budget. Permanent Amazon staff\u2019s pay will rise by at least 11% over their first two years of employment to at least \u00a38 an hour \u2013 up from a minimum of \u00a37.75. They also receive benefits including private medical insurance, a company pension plan, life assurance, subsidised meals, an employee discount and Amazon share grants. Amazon, which employs 7,800 permanent staff at its eight UK warehouses, would not reveal how many staff would be affected by the increase."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
