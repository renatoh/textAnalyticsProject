Otherwise commanding in the face of a sporadic attacks Nemanja Vidic 7 Made sure Chamakh knew he was in a game. Rarely left his side, tight to him and roughed him up a few times. Made some vital interceptions Patrice Evra 7 He felt his pre-match comments were taken out of context but his satisfaction was found on the pitch in an assured performance Darren Fletcher 7 Lost his cool when he felt he was fouled by Song at the end of the first half. Spiky and combative from start to finish Michael Carrick 7 Calming presence in front of the back four, rarely wasted possession and attempted to set the tempo. Gave no quarter in the challenge Anderson 7 Bundle of energy, endeavour and tricks. Was played high up the pitch and was ever keen to support Rooney. Showed a spirit of adventure Nani 8 United's most dangerous player, showed devastating ability with an instinctive effort that fizzed inches wide. Cross set up Park's goal Wayne Rooney 6 Started up on his own in Berbatov's absence, carried the fight to Arsenal's backs. Looked sharp when dropping off. Blazed his penalty over Park Ji-sung 7 Has the knack of scoring against Arsenal and after a frustrating start his fourth career goal against them was a sweetly improvised header Substitutes Ryan Giggs (for Anderson, 85) Arsenal Wojciech Szczesny 7 The Polish youngster looked nervous early on but quickly showed his confidence. Kicking slightly suspect; handling good. Bacary Sagna 6 Eager to bomb on and offer an outlet further forward. As the second-half wore on, he appeared more and more like an auxiliary winger. S\u00e9bastien Squillaci 7 A black eye seemed to symbolise his commitment: he read the game well and emerged with credit. One to quieten his detractors. Laurent Koscielny 7 The opening goal might not have happened if he had won his header with Fletcher from a high punt forward but he was generally solid. Ga\u00ebl Clichy 5 Testing evening up against Nani but always thinking of getting forward, often to the detriment of his defensive duties. Gave away the penalty. Alex Song 7 Dyed his hair to get noticed, and it has been his robust performances and desire to get forward that has caught the eye. Tomas Rosicky 5 Given the No10 role, ahead of other strong candidates, he struggled to justify his presence in the pivotal creative role. Jack Wilshere 6 Difficult to believe he is 18, such was his conviction and determination. Did not shirk in the challenge but unable to provide killer pass. Samir Nasri 5 Asked to provide inspiration from wide on the right, he was a peripheral figure in the first-half. More central in the second-half. Disappointed. Marouane Chamakh 4 Mixed evening. Dropped off to link the play and worked hard but only flickered in front of goal. Missed key chance on 56 minutes. Andrey Arshavin 4 Had Arsenal's fans tearing their hair out. Looked lethargic, failed to be decisive and did not seem up to the pace of the game. Substitutes Cesc F\u00e1bregas (for Rosicky, 64) Robin van Persie (for Wilshere, 64) Theo Walcott (for Arshavin, 77)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
