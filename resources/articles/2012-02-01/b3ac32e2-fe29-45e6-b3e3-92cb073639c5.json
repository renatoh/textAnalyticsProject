Writing in the NonProfit Times, a leading business publication for management of non-profits, editor-in-chief Paul Clolery said Brinker should resign not because of the initial policy change behind the decision, but for the way it was implemented and \"how the ensuing media was mishandled.\" Clolery wrote: \"The organization was out-maneuvered by Planned Parenthood because the potential backlash of cutting funding was clearly miscalculated.\" It follows last week's call, from a former board member and fundraiser for Komen NYC for Brinker and the board to resign. The fallout from the breast cancer charity's defunding of Planned Parenthood and its botched attempts to manage the ensuing row is now in its third week \u2013 and it shows no sign of abating. Clolery, the editorial director of NPT publishing group, writes: \"It is time for Nancy Goodman Brinker to step aside at Susan G Komen for the Cure. The controversy regarding the decision to pull money from Planned Parenthood was ill-advised, mistimed and strategically inept. The blame must be put at her doorstep as founder and chief executive officer.\" \"Again, discussion of how to spend an organisation's funds is valid. Hanging the reasoning on nonsense, such as a contrived congressional hearing, is inept. Continuing to insult the intelligence of donors is a miscalculation that Komen can't afford. \"The board needs to show some independence, thank Brinker for her decades of service, and start charting a course that begins to repair the organization's image.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
