A small army of 600 men and women descend with their cleaning materials for a five-hour scrubathon. Simultaneously, an orderly queue of 3,500 people in gleaming cars begins to stream forth out of the gates of the holiday village, while another 3,500 start to pour in. When I told my mother-in-law we were going to Center Parcs, she said a bit grimly: \"Snot in the water.\" Now, snot is not a word one hears her say very often, which is one reason it made me sit up and listen. It also conjured up a rather nasty image of kiddy snot, the size of an oil slick, slipping and sliding on the surface of the pool. And the pool is the centrepiece of each of the four Center Parc villages in the UK, and where most visitors will spend most of their time - partly because it's free, partly because it's fantastic, with flumes and slides, and whirlpools and waves. Oh joy! Pressed for more information, she summarised the science with: \"Lots of children with colds in warm water for long periods. Lots of snot.\" I am happy to report, Pamela, that the only snot I knowingly came into contact with - and I was looking, believe me - was that at the end of my own nose. Center Parcs is an extraordinarily smooth operation - snot is not part of the plan. If you are a parent of a child over the age of 18 months, you probably already know about the joy that is Center Parcs. But if you haven't yet been, there are several things you should be aware of before going. It's extremely popular. Anthea Turner and Denise Van Outen go there, as does Lorraine Kelly (though not together, as far as I know); the four villages have a 93.3% occupancy rate throughout the year (that's higher than my house), and there are a lot of people cycling around who obviously haven't ridden a bike for 25 years. Oh yes, and badminton - comfortingly - is the most popular activity. You should also know that, lovely as it is, the whole Center Parcs experience is somewhat surreal. We arrived at Center Parcs in Longleat Forest on a Monday afternoon at the start of the October half term holiday. There wasn't much of a queue to get in - firstly, because they have a very effective drive-in \"counter\" service in operation, rather better than the one at my bank, which ensures you are dealt with very speedily; secondly because everyone had got there before us. More than 65% of those who holiday at Center Parcs come back - and it shows. We constantly felt like a bunch of novices at the whole game. Everyone knew the ropes except us - the best place to park, where to book archery, the best time to get a table at Luciano's, (one of the 12 restaurants and bars on the 400-acre site - the Italian one, obviously); where to find the shoes for ten pin bowling. Everyone looked as though they'd been there at least 10 times before. Except us. So, if you go, these are the basic rules. You arrive, get your key, dump your stuff in your chalet (they call it a villa) then dump your car in the car park. And that's the last you see of it, until 10am on Friday when you leave. We thought - ridiculously as it turned out - that we might do a bit of sightseeing while we were down in Wiltshire. But don't even think of it. Once you're in, it simply does not pay to think of getting out. You'd never find your car for starters. And why would you want to, when there's so much to do? There really are dozens and dozens of activities if you want to fork out for them (it's not dirt cheap - ten pin bowling for four costs \u00a318.50, scuba diving for one \u00a325.50, archery \u00a37.20). Then there's ballet fusion, cardio kickboxing, t'ai chi, pilates, line dancing; flower arranging, creative writing, fencing, roller blading, silk painting; climbing, abseiling, falconry, horse riding, laser clay shooting, mountain biking, soccer school...The choice is astonishing, and I've only mentioned a few. It's all very safe, rather sanitised - nothing too challenging. Lovely for kids, perfect for generally sedentary adults who usually don't go further nor faster than an amble around their local supermarket. The other brilliant thing about Center Parcs is that every age is catered for. There are loads of really gorgeous tots everywhere, bobbing around in their cute little lifejackets; and I thought it was particularly nice to see their teenage brothers/sisters/cousins/friends sneakily snogging each other in the whirlpools, while their grandparents whizzed around the wild water rapids. I never thought anyone without a child would bother, but apparently 25% of Center Parcs' visitors come without kids. Indeed the company is increasingly targeting the top end of the market - if you have the cash (\u00a31200 for a weekend) you can hire an exclusive four-bedroom villa, with its own spa, steam room and outdoor hot tub. Sounds nice? Well, join the queue - they're booked up for the next 18 months. By comparison, a three-bedroom comfort villa for four nights at Longleat during half term will cost you just over \u00a3700 - it's the most basic accomodation on offer, but far more luxurious than anything we can offer our house guests. But dressed in your Speedo costume, with your bottom bumping along the wild water rapids at 20 mph, comfort or luxury doesn't really matter. Center Parcs (which originated in the very egalitarian Netherlands - hence the spelling) is a joyously levelling experience. Park the car, hire your bike, put on your cozzie and you're exactly the same as the next man or woman. You all spend your holiday pedalling from the Subtropical Swimming Paradise (the pool) to your villa (chalet) to the Jardin des Sports (sports complex) and back to your villa (chalet) again. And really, there's little nicer. So what did our boys think? They LOVED it. Matthew, who is nine, liked the archery, his bike, his bike padlock and his own double bed. His verdict: \"It was good. I liked the toy shop. I liked the wild water rapids. They were outside, so you were swimming in the rain. It was cool.\" Jack, who's four, liked the ten pin bowling: \"I liked the cartoons on the computer (that kept the bowling score). I made a cartoon come! I liked that train (a Land Rover with carriages that takes you from one end of the site to the other). I liked the pool - it was all rocky. And I liked the trailer I went in behind daddy's bike.\" His dad meanwhile loved the Aqua Sana, the health and beauty suite on site. In his normal habitat, he's as likely to pay for a session in a Finnish sauna/Greek herbal bath/Turkish Hammam as cut off his own arm. Champneys no way; Center Parcs spa, yes, please. Perfect adult pampering in a completely non-threatening environment, full of parents as ugly and knackered as yourself. So, there you have it. A bizarre but rather lovely prison.
