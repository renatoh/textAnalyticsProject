The hype machine inevitably went into overdrive when Liverpool pulled off the coup of replacing Brendan Rodgers with Klopp nine days ago but, after all the exhaustive analysis, the real business begins when the German takes his place in the away dugout at White Hart Lane on Saturday. Although the wait for Klopp\u2019s first game is almost over, he does not regard a testing assignment against Tottenham Hotspur as his moment of truth. Klopp led Borussia Dortmund to two Bundesliga titles but Liverpool are 10th after winning two of their first eight games and the 48-year-old believes his first task must be to improve his new team\u2019s mentality. \u201cI am able to wait for each step,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cThat is very important. I think you all work for a long time in the football business and you know how development works but you are always a little bit under pressure.\u201d Then came the click, Klopp\u2019s way of pointing out how expectations need to be kept at a realistic level. \u201cOK: now, but now, but now, but now,\u201d he said. \u201cFootball is not like this. You know this. We all have to feel confident to make the next step. I have to give the boys things that they are able to do. Of course I want to see a change in mentality, to go from the first second until the last second. \u201cNot because it was bad before but because that is the most easy thing to change. We have to go to London, go out of the stadium, go out of the dressing room and show what we can do. \u201cThat\u2019s what we are waiting for the whole week. That\u2019s what we dream of. All the tactical things, that\u2019s very important because we do not have to work so much on the physical side. \u201cMy ideas are not better than Brendan\u2019s. They are different, of course, and so we need time. That\u2019s a big challenge: to find a way to make the first step and that you can see that it is better. They have to get better in the games.\u201d Klopp insisted he has not gambled with his reputation by accepting Liverpool\u2019s offer. \u201cI am many things but not a gambler,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, absolutely not. I had no contact to any other club. For me it\u2019s very easy not to read the sport news. \u201cI have worked a whole day so I am not interested. When I heard about the interest from Liverpool I didn\u2019t think, \u2018OK, maybe I should wait.\u2019 No, I never had a plan. I heard it. I felt what I felt. \u201cAnd then I got some information, more and more. I am interested in English football so I knew many things. And then we decided together that we wanted to do this. We knew it was a big challenge. But life is a challenge so it\u2019s not the biggest problem.\u201d Tottenham, a point above Liverpool, are unbeaten in the league since losing at Manchester United on the opening day of the season and Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side thrashed Manchester City 4-1 in their previous home game. Klopp\u2019s job has not been made any easier after Danny Ings and Joe Gomez were both ruled out for the rest of the season with ruptured anterior cruciate ligaments, while Christian Benteke and Roberto Firmino will be missing against Tottenham with minor injuries. \u201cTottenham is not the most easy game to play, of course not,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely clear they are a football playing team. They want to pass. This is good for a team that wants to press. We will see what happens. If they do their things and we do our things, then we will find what\u2019s better in this game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
