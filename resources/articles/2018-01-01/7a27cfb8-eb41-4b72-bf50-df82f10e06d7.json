Exactly who killed Mercier and why it was so brutal remains a mystery, however. The Mercier case After last week\u2019s calamitous camp raid, CID have to redouble their efforts. Gilou does excellent extracurricular work keeping tabs on Jolers \u2013 and what a charmer he\u2019s turning out to be. A life of pimping, robbery and domestic abuse keeps him busy, and his side hustle of tipping off the Camaras to lucrative burglary targets leads us to the climactic final scene of the week. The Camaras attempt an audacious tunnelled safe heist, but Jolers sells them out, phoning in an anonymous tipoff to the police. The patrol cop answering the call kills Bakary as they make their escape. He told Drissa he had a bad feeling about the operation, but his big brother talked him round. Now that he\u2019s dead who knows what Drissa is capable of? It seems likely that Maria holds the answer to why Mercier was killed. We see that she is being held along with other girls at the house on Rue Emile Zola by the Albanian pimp Virgil Moldovan, though she manages to escape to parts unknown. CID at least have Moldovan in their sights now so with a bit of luck they\u2019ll locate Maria before her body shows up on a rubbish dump in the 19th arrondissement. Jos\u00e9phine I really thought Jos\u00e9phine would have something diabolically sophisticated to take down Vern Jr \u2013 perhaps involving GHB, a sex worker and a film crew. In the end, she just pancakes him in the car park with his own motor then manually crushes his testicles in intensive care. It\u2019s reckless and brutal, but it\u2019s all the catharsis she needs. The partners take the opportunity of Vern\u2019s incapacitation to let Jos\u00e9phine go and she winds up with Edelson. The Bodin case immediately catches her eye \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t it? There\u2019s sex, death and, in Roban and Machard, two pillars of the judicial establishment she so despises. We all know that Ms Karlsson is the last person you want on your case when you have something to hide. Here\u2019s my problem with that, though \u2013 I\u2019ve never believed that Jos\u00e9phine is motivated by injustice. She just loves a good dustup and thumbing her nose at elites. Mrs Bodin doesn\u2019t need to know any of the grim details of her son\u2019s case, but Jos\u00e9phine can\u2019t let it go because pit bulls never can. Roban The news we knew was coming is finally delivered. Roban has a stage III anaplastic astrocytoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. Showcasing his trademark stoicism, he asks the doctor how it would be if he just ploughed on without treatment. How very like him. He will die doing what he loves. As if he didn\u2019t have enough on his plate, he has to deal with a resurgent Jos\u00e9phine snapping at his heels over the Bodin case. She uncovers the fact that Machard bought an expensive watch for Nicolas \u2013 exactly the kind of reckless act that a lifetime of Masonic cronyism engenders. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to get away with this one, though. Thoughts and observations It feels churlish to point out that we never got 100% confirmation that Vern was the rapist. It would be quite a Spiralesque twist if it turned out to be, say, Edelman all along. Gilbert De Niro and Alain Melon are some memorable French aliases for the bad guys\u2019 burners. More on Sarkozy and his Paul Bismuth phone here. It\u2019s a powerful performance from Thierry Godard as Gilou explains his cold feet over entering Romy\u2019s life. I hope these two work it out. They were pretty adorable buying wrap-over bodysuits together. \u201cYou don\u2019t let up, you take risks, you take a hard line \u2013 you\u2019re completely autistic, but you get what you want.\u201d Edelman mastering the art of the backhanded compliment in his elevator pitch to Jos\u00e9phine. I loved Herville\u2019s subtext-laden \u201cI assure you, when the time comes I won\u2019t forget\u201d to his crew. I don\u2019t even know if they picked up on it, but they are going to regret that Photoshopped image of him as CID\u2019s poodle. If you\u2019re worried about Roban, you should be. The prognosis for a stage III anaplastic astrocytoma is not great. I was intrigued to read the comments below the line last week about Beckriche\u2019s nervous neck scratching. Sometimes an actor will use a persistent physical gesture to get across a character point from the bio (\u201cBeckriche is uptight and always under pressure to get results\u201d). He seems to have dropped it this week so maybe that\u2019s to illustrate him travelling along his redemption arc from careerist drone to good police?
