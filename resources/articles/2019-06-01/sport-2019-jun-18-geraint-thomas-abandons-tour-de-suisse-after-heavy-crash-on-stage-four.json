Much to the relief of Team Ineos following the withdrawal of Chris Froome last week after the four-times winner sustained multiple serious injuries, the Welshman suffered only abrasions to his shoulder and a cut above his right eye following the crash involving the Astana rider Andrey Zeits 27 kilometres from the finish of stage four in Arlesheim on Tuesday. Thomas received treatment from medical staff for several minutes before eventually abandoning the race but later admitted he had wanted to continue. \u201cYou\u2019ve always got to be cautious with a head injury and, whilst I was keen to carry on, the doctors made the right decision to pull me out of the race,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a lip in the road that came out of nowhere. An Astana rider hit the lip and crashed and I had nowhere to go. I landed on my shoulder and my face and there was quite a bit of blood.\u201d Thomas had been hoping to use the week-long race as his final tune-up before defending his Tour title and admitted the situation was far from ideal. \u201cClearly it\u2019s frustrating and a small setback for my Tour de France preparations but there\u2019s still plenty of time before we start in Brussels in a few weeks\u2019 time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will recalibrate and I\u2019m sure my coach will have a plan in place to ensure I\u2019m ready for 6 July.\u201d The Team Ineos doctor, Derick Macleod, said: \u201cGeraint took a heavy fall. The main area of impact was to his head. He passed his initial concussion roadside test but with the nature and severity of the impact, it was felt unsafe for him to continue in the race. He was taken to hospital and thankfully all the x-rays and scans have come back clear. Knowing Geraint, it won\u2019t take him long to get back on his bike but we\u2019ll need to ensure he\u2019s symptom free in the next few days before he does so. We\u2019re optimistic he\u2019ll make a full recovery and, all being well, he\u2019ll be back on his bike very soon.\u201d The incident comes a week after Froome was ruled out of next month\u2019s Tour because he suffered a fractured neck, a fractured right femur, a broken hip and fractured ribs when he hit a wall during a practice run for the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 time trial. The four-times champion lost control in high winds when he tried to blow his nose while cycling at 37mph. Thomas, who beat Froome into third place in last year\u2019s Tour, will now lead Team Ineos for the three-week race. He became the third British rider to win the Tour after surprisingly holding off the challenge of his teammate last year. The Welshman was voted BBC sports personality of the year following his achievement and is rated as the favourite to repeat his Tour success in the absence of Froome. Thomas has suffered a number of injuries down the years, including fracturing his pelvis during the 2013 race but riding on to help Froome claim his maiden Tour title."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
