The stark, angular shapes of her arms are electric with emotion; long percussive phrases of footwork stamp out impassioned interior monologues. She's a flamenco diva in a very modern style, yet the difficulty for Yerbabuena has always been in finding a form of dance theatre in which to present herself. Her latest work Cuando Yo Era (When I Was) is an evocation of her grandparents' world, set against the backdrop of the civil war. It opens on a bare stage, where three men await execution. And while shots are fired, and two keel over, the third mysteriously remains alive. It seems to be his history that the show imagines, via three flashback scenes. These are performed by Yerbabuena's small but exuberantly powered company, and include street dancers at a traditional fair, one of them a comedian in the style of Charlie Chaplin; and also a cock-fighting scene where two male dancers are transformed into elegantly lethal fighting birds, the choreography's strutting, preening rhythms given an exotic twist of Latin-American and Kathakali dance Linking all these flashbacks is Yerbabuena herself, dancing short, fierce solos in which she seems to interrogate her past. But problematically, those links never come into focus. Rather than telling a story or developing a relationship between herself and the surviving man, Yerbabuena resorts to an essentially abstract piece of stage symbolism: using a potter's wheel to suggest the idea of her own life being shaped by the hand of history. It's not an image that connects with anything else on stage. And it doesn't substitute for a theatrical throughline of transformation. Outstanding as some moments are, both in production and performance, Cuando Yo Era still feels like a collage of fragments, dominated and skewed by Yerbabuena's giant talent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
