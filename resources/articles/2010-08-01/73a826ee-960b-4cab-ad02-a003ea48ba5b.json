That is when, say, a shaft of sunlight pierces black, louring storm clouds to lance on one or other of the innumerable pools and ponds that populate the high ridges so they sparkle like jewels. A higher viewpoint helps \u2013 like when climbers on Needle Ridge occasionally catch the diamond glint on the tip of Napes Needle as sunbeams illuminate the tiny pool that gathers in a dimple following rain (and representing this puddle in a more enchanting light than that seen by the climber who has to sit in it because there is no more room on top of the famous obelisk). Skyline tarns are even more enhanced: I have tackled Kilnshaw Chimney's dark, scree-ridden confines to be rewarded with the sight of such a gem glowing a ruby red from the summit cairn on Red Screes, and Lily Tarn on Loughrigg resembling a silver salver on a day of sunlight and storm \u2013 when viewed from an adjacent knoll. And late on a July afternoon, a moon as white as a communion wafer sailing high over Robinson was mirrored in the limpid water of a tarn nestling between Kirkfell's two tops \u2013 only fleetingly spoilt by a dragonfly touching the surface to make the image quiver. Yesterday on Border End, a short clamber up from the summit of Hardknott Pass, I chanced on another hilltop pool, typically embedded into the turf as if with a pastry cutter, this time reflecting blue skies and white billowing clouds in its dark waters. Nothing compares, though, in my experience, with the summit tarn on Haystacks. So poised is its shining meniscus above the cliffs, its sudden appearance is like that of a wine glass held momentarily at eye level when proposing a toast, but with glorious summits resplendent in the background."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
