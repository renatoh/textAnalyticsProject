The intervention from the pop singer, who has almost 14 million followers on the photo-sharing platform, comes amid an increasing focus of the harmful effects Instagram can have, particularly on young people. \u201cYou get caught up in comparing yourself to other people. Should I be like that, act like that, look like that?\u201d she told the Sun. \u201cWill that make me more popular, or more successful? People are a slave to winning other\u2019s approvals. I refuse to bend a knee to convention and what society expects of me as a woman.\u201d Madonna, 60, added: \u201cI think Instagram is made to make you feel bad.\u201d Social networks are expected to soon encounter tighter laws amid growing concerns about child safety online, with companies being urged to prioritise the protection of their users over commercial interests. In the interview, the \u201cQueen of Pop\u201d said social media culture \u201cruns people\u2019s lives\u201d and she was fortunate to have grown up in the pre-social media era. \u201cI was lucky enough to have a life as an artist before the phone and Instagram and social media because I did have that time to develop as an artist and a human without feeling the pressure of judgment of other people or comparing myself to other people.\u201d She said it was now harder for artists to \u201cstick to your guns and be who you are\u201d, adding that the world needs \u201cvoices that are unique; we need inspiration \u2026 I want our other artists to think outside the box.\u201d The singer revealed that she tells her 22-year-old daughter, Lourdes, to \u201cstop being so consumed with the way you look or how people are going to compare you to me\u201d. \u201cI feel bad for young people who haven\u2019t had the opportunity to develop their character and who they want to be.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
