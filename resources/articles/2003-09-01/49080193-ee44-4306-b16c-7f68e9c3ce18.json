The meeting, chaired by Uefa's chief executive Gerhard Aigner, was called after conflicting statements were made in England and Turkey about the safety of fans in Turkey. The English FA has declined its ticket allocation for the game, fearing that a repeat of the trouble at the Stadium of Light in April could lead to the team being thrown out of the Euro 2004 finals next summer should they qualify. Following England's victory in Macedonia earlier this month Sven-Goran Eriksson, in a reference to the murder of two Leeds fans in Istanbul three years ago, said support ers could \"lose their lives\" if they tried to go to the game. Eriksson's comments drew an angry response from the president of the Turkish federation Hanuk Ulusoy. \"He [Eriksson] has forgotten the Heysel disaster. Of course he doesn't want England fans in Turkey because he doesn't want them to see a defeat,\" he said. At today's meeting, bringing together administrators and security advisers from the two countries, Aigner will call on both parties to be more measured in their statements. Uefa will also review the security plans for the game, potentially one of the most volatile in Europe for a decade. The English FA delegation will be led by the chairman Geoff Thompson and include the director of football affairs David Davies, the communications and marketing man Paul Barber and the head of security Ray Whitworth. Ulusoy will lead the Turkish party. The English group is expected to suggest a joint press conference by Eriksson and Turkey's coach Senol Gunes at which they would appeal for calm before and during the game. Initially it was hoped the two coaches would have been able to attend today's meeting but the Turkish FA is understood to have declined. Uefa's spokesman Mike Lee said: \"We are expecting to be informed of the progress...in security plans and by police. It is an opportunity to stress the importance of co-operation privately in relation to safety, security and ticketing.\" Yesterday the sports minister Richard Caborn again called on Sky to allow a terrestrial broadcaster to show delayed highlights to help persuade fans not to travel. Sky has exclusive rights to the game, for which it paid around \u00a33m. The satellite broadcaster has declined to comment on the request."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
