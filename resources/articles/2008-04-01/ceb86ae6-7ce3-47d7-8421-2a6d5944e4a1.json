The run-in to the nine-month marathon brings giddy incident, crazy results. The Valley's latest show was salted with madness, peppered with hail. A point each was better than nothing, worse than either wanted. Charlton, ludicrously, are not out of the play-offs despite six points from their last eight games. Southampton would have hugged this draw in November but, two points above the dotted line, embrace the possibility of the third tier. Slapstick attended both goals. Darren Randolph, Charlton's keeper recalled from loan at Bury with Nicky Weaver suspended, held the ball under his bar, then dropped it unchallenged on his team-mate Paddy McCarthy's head for an own-goal. He may have a future at Gigg Lane. Nigel Pearson, Saints' manager, confessed he missed it. \"I saw the keeper had it and turned away to say something to the bench.\" Even Ars\u00e8ne Wenger sees his goals. Later Jermaine Wright, waiting on the touchline after treatment for cramp, burst into play without the referee's say-so when the ball came his way only to be blown up for a cross that hit his hand. Andy Gray headed in the free-kick, his first goal in 12 appearances since joining as the league's top scorer from Burnley. Minutes later he gave Darren Ambrose the nod for a winner but Richard Wright blocked stunningly. Alan Pardew, so excitable in the Premier League, all but accepted there would be no instant return there: \"We had to sell some big hitters and not all our restructuring has worked out. It's difficult to come down and bounce straight back.\" Facts support him. Only five of the last 27 fallers from the top flight have returned at once. But what of the parachute payment? Besides, crowds have held up, within a thousand of capacity, despite five, now six, home games without a win. Money can burn holes in the pockets of judgment. \"We need that wellbeing of Premier League experience,\" Pardew added. He reached December in third spot. Randolph, a hero at Bury, was his 34th league player this season. Quality is usually a better bet than quantity. The manager warned that three or four first-teamers are playing for their retention but they will hardly know who they are. \"We need to be better technically,\" he said too, after a game of nervy first touches and awful final balls. Greg Halford, entrusted with free-kicks, scuttled or overhit so many he looked about to ask the referee if he could throw them. Pardew's final need was for \"a couple of warrior types\" but it was Southampton who had them. In the nick of time or maybe too late they have acquired Chris Lucketti and Chris Perry (late of Charlton) to fortify a fragile defence. Saint Christopher is the patron saint of travel and they may prove a more trusty guide to safety than Rupert Lowe, the smooth face of previous prosperity who is trying to regain control of the club he steered out of the top division in 2005. At present they are so close to the pits that they have cashed in on Theo Walcott's transfer to Arsenal, taking less sooner, to fend off administration. Saints have conceded two goals in four games but worryingly scored only four in six. In the closing moments here Jhon Viafara (a misprint at birth?) blew a kiss to a linesman for a favourable decision. It was a fitting signature to a dotty afternoon - that or hail and farewell.
