While circulations slide, the industry news has been dominated by job cuts and staff unrest, particularly among journalists. Even the hacks' own trade magazine, Press Gazette, is attempting to escape administration through creating an industry-wide trust to run it. Looking at the circulation picture, after two strong months in August and September, the October ABCs show the total national newspaper market sliding back into a more typical 3.7% year-on-year drop in sales volumes, despite frenetic promotional activity. Focusing on the main sectors in terms of their year-on-year performance (October 2006 compared with October 2005) shows the daily market dropping by 3% overall: \u00b7 Popular dailies (-4.6%). The mass market remains a torrid place to be. The Sun is the best of a bad bunch with a 3.6% drop. \u00b7 Mid-market dailies (-0.7%). The Mail holds steady while the Express continues to slide (-3%). \u00b7 Quality dailies (-2.1%). The star performer is a resurgent Financial Times (+5%), while the Telegraph holds steady, backed by a range of free gifts and a cut-price coupon promotion. Intense promotional activity continued through the month, ranging from wallcharts to cook books to DVDs, and has resulted in some share-swapping between the Times, the Independent and the Guardian. The Sunday market continues to perform significantly worse than the weekday papers, slipping by 4.3%. \u00b7 Popular Sundays (-7.9%). By far the worst market at the moment, with the People plummeting by 13% and the News of the World by 9%. \u00b7 Mid-market Sundays (+2.5%). This is the only sector across the whole industry to show any year-on-year growth, driven up by a 5% rise from a buoyant Mail on Sunday, while the Sunday Express drops by 4%. The weekday gap between the Mail and Express turns into a gulf on Sundays. \u00b7 Quality Sundays (-2.8%). The Observer had a stonking October (+8%) - its best month in market share terms since its relaunch in January. The big issue is how much of the Sunday Times 8% drop is due to its new \u00a32 cover price? The answer to that question, which the editor John Witherow is no doubt keen to know, has big implications for the rest of the quality market as cover prices continue to rise. Looking to London, the free newspaper battle is hotting up with News International's the London Paper overcoming its initial distribution glitches: its October ABC of 377,525 edges it ahead of Associated's London Lite by just under 5,000 copies, so the circulation race is now neck and neck. Also, the London Paper has just won the contract to distribute inside the 10 mainline rail stations controlled by Network Rail. The deal is reported to have cost News International somewhere in the region of \u00a31m, with some observers estimating that it will yield a net increase in distribution of only 60,000 additional copies a day. Yet control of these key sites has a significance beyond the immediate circulation pay-back. Advertising volumes are building very slowly. Ad pages at the two papers make up, on average, only 15% of total pagination. At Metro there is a 45% ratio. As a result, the revenues that are needed to support both publishing operations in the long term are simply not yet coming on stream. The effect of all this free activity on the Evening Standard is beginning to be more visible. The September ABCs showed that its paid-for sale was 56,000 down year-on-year. This has now increased in October to a 70,000 year-on-year gap. Only the coming months will show whether this is the start of an ongoing freefall or is just a short-term readjustment. In Scotland, News International is ruthlessly active again as the cut-price Sun continues to grind into the beleaguered Daily Record. Having edged ahead in July, the Sun is steadily and remorselessly extending its lead, which was 24,000 copies a day in September and is now running at 31,000 copies in October. All this circulation volatility is being reflected in deeper structural changes taking place within the newspapers themselves. Daily Telegraph journalists teeter on the edge of strike action in the wake of alterations to working practices that followed their recent office move. The latest Telegraph accounts show the cost of the move, the restructuring and its associated redundancies at \u00a346m, which has pushed the publisher \u00a312m into the red this year in comparison to last year's \u00a333m operating profit. Meanwhile, job cuts, particularly among journalists, are sweeping across the whole newspaper industry. Andrew Neil recently enthused that \"we are in the midst of a new Wapping\", that \"there has never been a better time to be a journalist\" and that with the growth of personal blogs, journalists are turning into \"brands in their own right.\" The journalists themselves are not so sure about all this talk. Most are simply wondering whether they will have an ordinary job to go to in the brave new world of 24-hour, multi-platform news that the national press is morphing into. The future shape of the whole industry is currently being worked out on newsagents' shelves and on the streets. \u00b7 Jim Bilton is managing partner of Wessenden Marketing, an independent media research firm. www.wessenden.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
