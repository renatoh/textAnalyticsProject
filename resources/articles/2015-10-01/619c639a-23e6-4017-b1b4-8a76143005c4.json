That\u2019s a book, in two days. Lovely. Can\u2019t see those being shite. Join me here, clinging to a small drawing done by my child, trying to remember the good in the world, same time next week. She says thank you and she should thank him because he\u2019s saved her from being known forever more as the woman on The Apprentice who wore those suits. Selina is given an eleventh hour reprieve and Scott knows he was never really going anyway. I enjoyed how Gary switched so quickly from slagging off Selina to punching the air when he sees her coming through the door. Apprentice candidates should never wear shorts during this process. It diminishes their power base. There\u2019s no way Scott is going. I think it\u2019s Selina. I hope it is. I really want Ruth to stay. As the plinky piano of doom builds towards the first of several false crescendoes, the firing finger of GO AWAY is tragically aimed and launched at... Ruth. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t sell a bone to Battersea dogs\u2019 home,\u201d sneers Alan as Ruth tries and fails to get him to listen to her. I want him to stop talking. Scott butts in and Alan lets him talk for longer than he\u2019s ever let a girl. I know but come on. Selina\u2019s defence of her business track record is vehement. Alan and Scott both shut her down with their patronising head-pats. I might chuck myself in front of a show-jumping rabbit in a minute to make my point. \u201cI find you very unconcise,\u201d says Selina to Ruth. I\u2019ll just let that sit there. Scott massively dithered, Selina got slammed by Claude and Karren and Ruth is enthusiastic but apparently ineffective as a capitalist drone. Who will be shoved into the pit of fire this week? Place your bets. I\u2019d push Selina but I bet it\u2019s Ruth. She\u2019s too reasonable. Scott, the rotten splitter, is bringing back Ruth and Selina. The girls are taking the blame again. I am starting to become uneasy about this because they are all clearly as useless as each other. Equality in all things. Elle blames their failure to secure the balloons. \u201cThey were a phenomenal product,\u201d says Brett in a way that makes my heart bleed for him. His eyes dim as he says this. I\u2019m sure they used to be blue. Gary with his hair (solid mass) was a floating sales Exocet who hit a sum total of no targets. Ruth reacts in a very restrained way when Alan seems to tell her to sod off. Why is she here? She shouldn\u2019t be here. \u201cYou don\u2019t get nine lives in this process,\u201d smarms Alan. No one moves. After a respectful pause, Scott starts defending and the first bluster of faux fury is aimed at Ruth\u2019s jaunty lapels. He huffs and puffs about her \u201cscenic route\u201d approach to conversations. Ugh, almost like she has real human traits. What was she thinking? Selina immediately jumps in when her assistance from Scott over that sale is called into question. Claude shuts her down as she fights for her life. Claude hammers in another nail, telling her she just didn\u2019t seem that interested. Everyone else remains silent. Back in the sad cafe (Holly Hunter hammering away at the keys just out of shot) Selina and Scott begin the post mortem. But we hear very little of it. Before we know it, we\u2019re back in the boardroom and everyone looks irked. Scott and team retreat to the pleather sofas without as the smug dickheads of Versatile kiss Mo Farrah\u2019s behind in a frightful manner and pull stupid poses in their sports day outfits. I hurt for them all. Claude and Karrren run through the figures for both teams. It turns out the dog sofas were not, as predicted, a total bust. Team Versatile walk off with it and get an exclusive training session with Mo Farrah. Some of them look honoured and delighted but most of them are sad there\u2019s no rooftop champagne and canapes. Charleine, with a steely gaze fixed on Alan every time his eyes dart past her, makes it known clearly and loudly that she vetoed the dog beds but was over-ruled. Did everyone hear that? She didn\u2019t want the dog beds. Scott splutters about his reasons for choosing the cat sky scrapers. He sold three, to be fair. He gives Ruth her dues but in a back-handed way. Brett maintains the rod up his spine and talks like a police officer describing the scene of a crime in court. Is he an ex-cop? \u201cOne of you will go walkies,\u201d says Alan. Delivering this week\u2019s zinger with so little enthusiasm I\u2019m wondering how many takes that took. I\u2019m going for 15. The teams confess the sins of which products they picked. David defends the balloons and Karrren remarks on the chaos of their balloon customer influx. Since when did these people complain about an influx of customers? Booh to the narrator for stealing a pet pun from the slavering chops of Sugar himself. It\u2019ll be a different narrator next week. Mark my words. Gary is brought over to the dog bed wasteland with 45 minutes to go. Sam lobs faux fur around while Vana stands on a box and hosts an impromptu fashion show for the frightening t-shirts. Joseph somehow makes a small boy cry and kick him while selling the mum a balloon. Ruth is frustrated. Richard is defensive and confident simultaneously. Ruth tries to sell via the studied method of spraying her target with a verbal torrent so constant that they retreat, drenched in her words and confused about how to leave the building. Everyone including Claude cautions against her chatty approach. She\u2019s not closing sales because she\u2019s too busy yapping about her 21 year marriage. Ruth is my \u201ctoo good for this\u201d candidate. She\u2019s happily married and talks to people as though they were actually human. She needs to run and run now, as fast as she can. If the guest rapper on a 90s dance record with an inexplicably massive house in Miami happens to be in the exhibition hall, he\u2019ll be in luck. Otherwise, he\u2019s screwed. I prefer Vana infinitely with a cute little nose and whiskers. Disappointed that Karrren hasn\u2019t muched in and gone for full-face badger make-up in tribute to Alan. Richard tries desperately to flog the ugly, over-priced pimp beds for canines. Massive, ugly things fit only for the corner of a utility room on Cribs. The rabbit agility course is a terrific metaphor for The Apprentice. Dumb, well-groomed creatures jump through hoops for an eternity while someone judges their jumpability and whiskertitude for no reason. Achieving nothing. Selina and Scott tussle extremely politely over a sale. She asks for his help and then, when the cash register rings, she says through gritted teeth, \u201cIt was my sale.\u201d Can\u2019t wait for that little row in the boardroom. The creepy animal balloons with legs are selling like hot bags of air. At a fiver a pop they\u2019re keeping the team ticking over but will that add up to a day trip to a luxury pet food factory with after-tour drinks in the staff canteen? The prizes have been pretty dreck so far, let\u2019s face it. The LED cat toy looks like fun but Brett\u2019s patter about \u201csensory load\u201d sounds like utter balls. One pet owner buys something for her cat\u2019s birthday. I really do despair of all humans at times like this. Selina and Ruth try to sell, was that the dog beds???, for \u00a31,400. Did I hear that right? Hard to keep up. When will they learn? No one is that mad? I\u2019ll resign from the human race if anyone is that mad. The dog beds are the nought percent finance and nothing to pay \u2018til 2019 pimped beds of any dog\u2019s dreams. Big pleather things with faux fur throws. At least I hope it\u2019s faux. Can\u2019t imagine any dog wanting to lie on the skinned coat of their friend. Scott massively patronises Ruth and praises her enthusiasm, giving her a key sales role. Is it me or are the women mostly being patted on the head this week? \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any more talk about balloons,\u201d mutters Scott, hoping no one can hear him in case it\u2019s a good call in which case he wants to make sure he\u2019s said it, however quietly, on camera. So he does want them? Or doesn\u2019t he? He\u2019s even managed to confuse me about whether he\u2019s behind the balloons or not. It\u2019s the next day and they\u2019re off to the exhibition to sell their things to people. They have an hour to set up their pitch. Natalie does a quick vox pop, registering her disapproval for Brett\u2019s strategising. Scott and Brett want to go for the frightening t-shirts and some other tawdry accessory. When he\u2019s asked whether to nix the balloons or not, he won\u2019t or can\u2019t commit. He can feel the finger hovering by his shoulder, like in that horror movie where the man gets a hand transplant from the dead pianist and they have a mind of their own. Oh, you know what I mean. I find animals quite boring. Is it just me? Scott\u2019s team are still receiving presentations from randoms. Cat paw-warmers, LED cat toys and walking animal ballons (is it time for medicine yet?) are all wheeled out and they whoop and awwww with real conviction. David overrules Charleine\u2019s cat tower preference and they bet the farm on some dog beds. On the other team, Ruth is all about the rabbit hutches and so it Selina. Their PM Scott ignores the women completely and defers to Gary. Fuming. Richard talks up his selling abilities and Gary gawps gormlessly as a man tries to persuade him of the importance of a really tall rabbit hutch. Over in the \u201ccat sector\u201d (which must also be a thing) Gary talks turkey with a woman selling cat towers. \u201cThey really stand out,\u201d says Charleine, looking at the baskety things on wooden sticks and trying to muster some inner wow. It\u2019s not working. The eco-friendly poo-bag men smiles winningly in their matching sweaters at Bret as he tries to knock down their price. Imagine you woke up every day knowing you purpose in life was to sell biodegradable shit sacks. Only marginally more useful a purpose than typing live thoughts about a television programme. The kalxon has sounded. This man with the beard has seriously just pitched the candidates flourescent outer-garments for poultry. Will the last person to leap into the sea please turn the sun off? Good heavens above. David nods avidly at the man selling him revolting animal-face t-shirts. They are \u00a325 each and frightening. I\u2019ve never knowingly been frightened by a t-shirt. Bret talks about the \u201crabbit sector\u201d like that has ever been a thing. It may have been a band in the early 90s, but that\u2019s it. Some other candidates admit to owning a dog but they all know this places them in line for the guillotine if their team loses. Wouldn\u2019t put it past any of them to quietly sneak off and kill their dogs to remove the incriminating evidence. Scott says he has a little dog so he should be PM. Ruth is trampled in the rush to congratulate Scott on having a dog. She looks well peeved. David is really passionate and blah business cappucino so pumped right now, so he gets the PM job for the team he is in which escapes me. RIGHT, the statue of the cat leads him to the massively lucrative pet market. The candidates must choose the right products and take them to The London Pet Show for the selling of. There. Char, April and Vana swap with three boys on the other team so that the competition is more mixed again. Sugar always treats this team-choosing as an incredible skill only he has. Check out my PE team-picking skillz. My friend got married in Dr Samuel Johnson\u2019s house. It USED to be lovely but I\u2019ll never set foot in it again. Every series, this show ruins another beautiful landmark for me. How on earth is he going to link Johnson to pets? The final 15 awake at 5.30am to the tinkle of their reproduction vintage telephone. Natalie (flattened Roxette) tells the house they must muster and meet Sugar at the house of Samuel L Jackson in 40 seconds or they\u2019ll all be gassed. The candidate I can\u2019t forget is Vana. She has an expression that permanently disapproves of everything from her nostrils down. A quick recap reminds us of the Debacle Francais from last week. I think they should have to shovel shit every week, just as a leveller. That\u2019s it, Jenny! Jenny was erroneously fired for not really being that bad at all and Vana dodged the bullet with VANA in big letters scribbled on the side. If you died tomorrow, would your last thought be \u201cOh bum\u201d I wasted last night watching The Apprentice, episode four, pet week? NO! Because it\u2019s brilliant. Looking at my chart of dullards, I actually can\u2019t remember who was fired last week? Was it Chet? Glendular? Froog? Here come the Apprentice candidates (in a minute), hair in heated rollers, testicles in hand (both genders), ready to grind their fellow man into the Axminster if it means a bearded grump with a bank account telling them they\u2019re OK. It\u2019s the week we\u2019ve all been waiting for: pet week! Because every episode must have a theme from which Alan can riff his tardy zingers. Expect dogs, bones, something fishy and a whole host of fur punnery as our candidates try to flog product at the London Pet Show. Three words: high-vis chicken vests. I hope that\u2019s not too spoilery but more something to look forward to. What a time we\u2019re in for as the remaining *counts on fingers* 48 candidates squabble over squeaky toys and generally harangue London\u2019s pet owners in a threatening manner. Join me here just before 9pm and we\u2019ll take this thing for a walk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
