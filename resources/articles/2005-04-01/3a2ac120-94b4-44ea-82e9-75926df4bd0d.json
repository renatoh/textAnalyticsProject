Her charms were the talk of London and a record of her story should by rights be a sexy, roughshod ride through 18th-century society. Lisa Hilton charts Miss Fenton's rise from poverty among the gin-soaked destitutes of London, as she sleeps her way to riches and high society. Although she eventually peevishly leaves her wealth to her doctor, Lavinia's steeliness in avoiding her mother's career choice of prostitution is admirable and the parts of the book dealing with her are absorbing and well written. Despite painstaking research, however, there just isn't enough of her story to fill a book and, instead, there are extended passages on all aspects of London that could conceivably be background to Lavinia's life. Politics, the gin laws, prostitution, theatre gossip, Gay, Swift and Pope are all here. The effect should be a lively historical evocation with a fascinatingly filthy social-climbing whore as a focus. Sadly, the result is rather more like a rambling, 1750s Popbitch. The detail is often half-heartedly salacious (lengthy descriptions of castrati, for instance, or the prevalence of venereal disease) and disjointed. Although Hilton's style is, at times, positively edible, it's a shame that her many hours spent poring over theatre programmes and ancient gossip sheets have failed to produce anything substantial, original or even shocking."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
