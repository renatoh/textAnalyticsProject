Karma never quite wins'", "bodyText": "John Lithgow, the self-described \u201cprofessional actor\u201d and \u201camateur satirist\u201d, has won many Tonys, Emmys and Golden Globes. Recently he starred as Winston Churchill in the first season of The Crown, the predatory CEO of Fox News Roger Ailes in the 2019 film Bombshell, and an attorney in the TV reboot of Perry Mason. Last year his poetry book, Dumpty, about Donald Trump and his cronies, became a bestseller. A follow-up, Trumpty Dumpty Wanted A Crown: Verses for a Despotic Age, has just been published. What were your honest emotions when you learned Trump had tested positive for Covid-19? Oh well, they were complicated and mixed. With so many of my friends, we\u2019ve said: \u201cOh, why doesn\u2019t he get the coronavirus?\u201d Then when it happened, it\u2019s like a child\u2019s magical thinking. You immediately feel ashamed of yourself. But it is karmic. The reason why I wrote these books, and it was so easy to write them, is because so many elements of the Trump personality and the Trump administration are the elements of comedy. He\u2019s hubristic, then karma catches up with him over and over again. But ultimately, he keeps on surviving. Karma never quite wins. Have you written any poems about the presidential campaign? The very, very short answer is no. And I\u2019m glad of it, because it\u2019s real drudgery. You try spending your entire day thinking about nothing but rhyme and metre, it\u2019s not easy. I just hope No\u00ebl Coward felt the same way. There\u2019s always a debate about whether satire defangs the monster. Do you ever worry that\u2019s a danger? I don\u2019t know about a danger. It is a big debate. And it is a dilemma. But just imagine if there was no satire. Everybody would be getting away with murder. And satire may not change anything, but it quickens people\u2019s consciousness, and it reassures people that you\u2019re not the only one who feels this way. Yes, it is true that satirists are preaching to the choir, but they\u2019re emboldening the choir. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important. Instead of a book tour, you\u2019ve asked friends \u2013 such as Meryl Streep and Samuel L Jackson \u2013 to read poems, which you post on YouTube. Was it difficult to persuade them to stick their necks out? Everybody said yes immediately, and that very much surprised me. There was only one of the actors, and I won\u2019t tell you who it was, who said: \u201cI\u2019ll do it, but just give me one that\u2019s not too savage.\u201d What have you enjoyed culturally in Covid times? Well, my wife and I have, like most of the world, been streaming television like crazy: Babylon Berlin, Trapped and Borgen, and something as benign as Last Tango in Halifax. The Crown is returning soon, and one of the great aspects of that show is the casting, which is brilliant but often surprising. Were you, as Churchill, an example of that? Well, I was an unusual Churchill. I\u2019m much, much taller than him, I am American and not English. But then Churchill himself was different from everybody else. He\u2019s as different from most Englishmen as he is from Americans, in a sense. So it was a very ingenious and oddball idea to cast quite a different person from the rest of the actors, quite an outsider. After Churchill, you played Roger Ailes. What\u2019s your process when you take on a real person? Well, I do a tremendous amount of research\u2026 Actually not a tremendous amount, I dabble really. I take what I need. But it\u2019s very interesting that I played Churchill and Roger Ailes in quick succession because in the case of Churchill, there was very little makeup. There were these little plumpers that I put inside my mouth clicking on my back teeth. I stuffed cotton up my nose, but there was nothing glued on me except my balding wig, which made me even more bald than I actually am. But that was it. It was about 20 minutes of makeup. Whereas Roger Ailes was a two-and-a-half-hour makeup. Actually, it was during those two-and-a-half hours that I wrote a lot of poetry for the first book. Is it true that the role of Frasier Crane was originally written with you in mind? Yes, that is true. I never wanted to put that out into the public for many years \u2013 really sympathising with Kelsey Grammer. But it was at a time when I was ticking off movies. I\u2019d gotten two Oscar nominations in a row [for The World According to Garp in 1983, and Terms of Endearment in 1984]. A TV comedy series was so beneath my dignity that I barely even remember being told that it had been offered to me. And I only found out years later when I worked with [Cheers co-creator] Jimmy Burrows on 3rd Rock from the Sun, and after that I had no dignity left. To remain sane as an actor, do you have to not think of roles you turned down? Oh, it\u2019s really hard to put it out of your mind. I\u2019m a lucky actor, I get offered all sorts of marvellous things. But it seems all the best things I\u2019m offered, I\u2019ve turned down and some other actor goes off and wins Oscars for them. I\u2019m sure I have the record for the most Tony awards won by actors in roles I\u2019ve turned down: there\u2019s been about 10 of them. But I try to tell myself I have no regrets. And I try to believe it. The new Perry Mason has been very popular, especially in the States. Did you expect it to be a hit? I was convinced Perry Mason was going to be great. And I consider it pretty great. But sometimes you\u2019re completely wrong. In the 1980s, I replaced another actor in a movie that was being done out in Nebraska. They hustled me out there for just five days to shoot all my scenes. And it seemed like a movie completely in chaos. Nobody was listening to the director and actors weren\u2019t speaking to each other and scenes were getting cut and shuffled in and out of the script. And I thought: \u201cWow, this is a disaster! Let me get this five days over with and just go home.\u201d That was Terms of Endearment. Ha ha, you never know, do you? What will you do if Trumpty Dumpty wins again? I can\u2019t even imagine what it\u2019s going to be like if he wins. I really\u2026 you know, you just asked me a question that has struck me dumb. It\u2019s that dark a possibility. But we will survive somehow, I suppose. \u2022 Trumpty Dumpty Wanted a Crown: Verses for a Despotic Age by John Lithgow is published by Chronicle Prism (\u00a317.99).
