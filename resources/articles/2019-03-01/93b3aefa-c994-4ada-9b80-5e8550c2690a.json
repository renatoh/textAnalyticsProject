Rufus Jones, the comedy actor who seems to have been in everything, but who is probably best known for Camping and W1A, stars in and wrote the show. He has called it \u201can angry, helpless response to what we were all seeing on the news in 2015\u201d. A painfully middle-class family return from holiday in France, only to find that when they unpack the car, a Syrian asylum seeker called Sami (Youssef Kerkour) has swapped some of their luggage for himself, and made the journey back to Dorking with them. What follows is a hybrid of a fish-out-of-water, family/flatshare comedy, in which Sami\u2019s presence ends up revealing the good and the bad in the people around him. Peter, played by Jones, is a classic plonker, obnoxious and reactionary. He is the one who worries that Sami could be a terrorist, or have Ebola. There is a gentle Brexit joke flung in his direction, but otherwise, the B-word doesn\u2019t figure. Peter doesn\u2019t want any kind of disruption, or a new member joining a family that is barely established as it is. To balance him out, Katy (Rebekah Staton), his girlfriend of 10 months, is kind and welcoming and swears a lot, and Staton does a solid job of conveying her no-nonsense big heart. Katy\u2019s youngish son John has little patience for the new stepfather-figure in his life, but sees Sami\u2019s arrival as the beginnings of an adventure. Sami just wants to stay in Britain, and find his family, from whom he was separated on the journey. He is keen to reassure everyone that he does not have Ebola. It\u2019s all very warm and cosy, yet it feels mild-mannered to a fault. It is not really about the plight of refugees, at least not on the evidence of this opening episode, but it is about immigration, and what that looks like in Britain today. Are we welcoming? Are we hostile? It is hard to conceive of a more inflammatory topic for a sitcom, but ultimately, it doesn\u2019t go there much. Sami\u2019s dealings with British bureaucracy are relatively pain-free. There is a wordy, fun joke about the difference between \u201cimply\u201d and \u201cinfer\u201d, and Sami talks about driving on different sides of the road. That is not to say this should be a documentary, or a harrowing reconstruction of the plight of asylum seekers. But I came away from Home thinking it needed to be more of something. More bold, more brave, or possibly more stupid. As it is, it sits somewhere in the middle. It straddles comedy and drama, as all commissions now must \u2013 you can\u2019t be funny unless you are poignant \u2013 but it does neither with depth or conviction. It is a new and contemporary concept that speaks to the times we live in, but it is packaged in old-fashioned family sitcom humour. It is almost as if Jones can see where there might be problems with what he has created and tries to address them, if not swerve them, by putting them right there in the script. \u201cHe\u2019s not Paddington,\u201d snaps Peter at one point, infuriated by Katy\u2019s insistence that Sami stay with them. \u201cYes he is, he\u2019s exactly fucking Paddington,\u201d she replies. In next week\u2019s episode, this Paddington has to deal with cartoon racists and assumptions about his religion, which even Hugh Grant might struggle to spin into family-friendly gold. But right now, Sami is simply a good man in need of help, which people are more than willing to provide. There is no harm in gentle comedy, of course, and it never hurts to be reminded that people can be kind and good, even if they are fictional creations. The moment I really laughed out loud came, ironically, from a very Paddington scenario, if Paddington were a Syrian man in a loud zip-up cardigan. In order to prove his familiarity with an English kitchen, Sami spoons Marmite into his mouth. \u201cMy one weakness \u2013 chocolate spread,\u201d he says, pointedly tucking in. The expression Kerkour manages to wrestle out of his own face is a picture of slowly dawning horror and a total delight. So it has its moments. But it feels slight, and nice, and ever so presentable. Despite that timely premise, it has settled for familiarity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
