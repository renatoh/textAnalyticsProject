Details of its route must be lodged in the minds of a very large proportion of the population, a national unifier in dreary grey concrete. Route 66 it isn't. There's no joy in driving the M1's full length, unless your destination is a happy one, but the sight of things such as the radio masts at Daventry or the point, by junction 19, where the lights are replaced by darkness are memories most people share. So are the endless roadworks \u2013 currently under way along its length in Barnsley, Buckinghamshire and Barnet, where last week's fire pushed the road, unexpectedly, into the news bulletins. But then the M1 is only ever noticed when things go wrong on it. It lacks even the debatable beauty of more elegant bits of the motorway network \u2013 the Chilterns cutting on the M40, the Shap moorlands on the M6, and the farmhouse trapped between the carriageways high on the M62. None of these roads matter as much as the M1, the spine of England and a seemingly unavoidable element of any road journey between north and south. It has been woven unnoticed into all sorts of lives since the first section opened, in 1959. At the start of the Beatles' 1965 tour, George Harrison's guitar fell off the roof of his Austin Princess on to the M1. Maybe somewhere, in some lost corner of the central reservation, the bits are still there: the M1 can be horrible, dangerous, ugly \u2013 but above all it is an unloved national lifeline."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
