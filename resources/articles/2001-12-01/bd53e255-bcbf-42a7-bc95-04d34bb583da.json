He becomes the 11th manager in the Glasgow club's history and succeeds Dick Advocaat, who has stayed on to become director of football. The move was completed after Rangers agreed a compensation package with Hibernian, who had initially refused the Light Blues permission to talk to their man. McLeish will have to wait until Saturday to pick his first Rangers team because Advocaat is to remain in charge for tomorrow's visit of Hibs. Rangers are at Motherwell on Saturday, ironically the club where 42-year-old ex-Scotland and Aberdeen defender McLeish began his managerial career in 1994."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
