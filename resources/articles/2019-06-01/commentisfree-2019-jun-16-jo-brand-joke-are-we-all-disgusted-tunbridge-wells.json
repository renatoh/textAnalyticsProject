Thunderstruck, flabbergasted, jaw on the ground, fists in the air, full body-a-tremble outraged... In case you didn\u2019t hear, in the past few days, Jo Brand has been catapulted from \u201cfunny-in-the-90s\u201d comedian to cause celebre, via a stint in the social media stocks. The trigger was a comment made on Radio 4\u2019s Heresy, a comedy panel show that primes guests to challenge received wisdom on a range of topics via \u201cheretical\u201d comments. Tuesday\u2019s episode included a segment on the divisiveness of Brexit, in which Brand, referring to Nigel Farage\u2019s milkshake moment, suggested that battery acid might have made a more apt projectile. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna do it, it\u2019s purely a fantasy, but I think milkshakes are pathetic, I honestly do. Sorry,\u201d she added, likely little imagining she\u2019d soon be repeating that last word in earnest. The early evening programme has perfectly respectable figures but the clamorous backlash that greeted its panellist\u2019s comments sent them viral. I\u2019m willing to bet that in the context of the show \u2013 and in the context of Jo Brand being, well, Jo Brand \u2013 plenty of listeners registered the quip as nothing more than an off-colour and ill-judged comedic fail. After all, as another commentator has since pointed out, this is the same entertainer who once confessed to having \u201ca soft spot for Nick Clegg. Face down on Hackney Marshes\u201d. Ba-dum. Of course, that was before an MP was murdered in cold blood and there is now a justly heightened awareness of the very real menace posed by intolerance of divergent viewpoints. It\u2019s ironic, then, that in the backlash to Brand\u2019s joke, any hope of a meaningful discussion hightailed it down the culture wars\u2019 cul-de-sac. As Brexiters have been quick to note, switch the maker of this particular joke with its butt and Farage would have been unanimously slammed. It\u2019s sort of a fair point and yet it ignores key mitigating factors here. The show is taped in front of a live audience, so is inherently off the cuff. Unlike Danny Baker\u2019s monkey picture post, the gaffe wasn\u2019t premeditated. Most crucially, Brand is a comedian. While she may not tickle your funny bone (she rarely does it for me these days), her comments about Farage are very different from rape \u201cjokes\u201d told by members of the public at the expense of Labour MP Jess Phillips, say. It\u2019s not about comedians having a get-out-of-jail-free card (albeit one that\u2019s expired in the age of trial by Twitter), it\u2019s about them being part of a tradition reliant on boundary-pushing, on shock and transgression. Everyone should be allowed an occasional miss, if miss this was, and even comedic hits will never have the entire auditorium rolling in the aisles. Comedy is personal. Brand\u2019s joke will soon be forgotten. She has apologised and it has been announced that a police investigation has been dropped. If you tune in to the relevant episode via Auntie\u2019s catch-up service, you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s been edited out, a move that show creator David Baddiel has characterised as cowardly. What lingers is the ear-ringing moral outrage that greeted it, a kind of ethical tinnitus that cumulatively risks deafening us to nuance and complexity. A culture of echo chambers and trigger warnings is rendering us increasingly ill-equipped to deal with the unpalatable \u2013 our response is super-sized and invariably driven by social media, meaning that context and reflection are among its first casualties. In the age of hashtag morality, we are all now #Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells. \u2022Hephzibah Anderson is a writer and critic"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
