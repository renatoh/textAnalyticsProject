As he chats at Villa\u2019s training ground in the run-up to Saturday\u2019s Premier League joust with Liverpool, the right-back who is likely to be tasked with subduing Sadio Man\u00e9, Mohamed Salah and co describes how he got to this point despite \u2013 and partly because of \u2013 a series of mishaps and misjudgments. But first let us address the fact that in one respect there is nothing surprising about this 24-year-old taking on the European champions. He, after all, has conquered the continent himself. Any analyst could tell you that. He has been a favourite of statisticians since the 2017-18 season when, as a player at Caen, he won more tackles than any other defender in the five main European leagues and ranked second for interceptions. He has been Villa\u2019s most prolific tackler and interceptor despite missing the first two games. Those qualities, along with his forward dashes and crosses, are what make him so exciting to watch. \u201cI\u2019m not big and strong so I have to be able to anticipate,\u201d he says by way of explanation for his exceptional reading of play. But what accounts for his combativeness in one-on-one duels? Does it have anything to do with where he was born: Valognes, a Normandy town that was awarded the Croix de Guerre after the second world war because of the extraordinary valour of its residents? He smiles at that notion. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly to do with what I\u2019ve been through myself,\u201d he says. \u201cI left home when I was 11 to join Caen\u2019s academy. I spent six years there and then they said they didn\u2019t want to keep me.\u201d One coach said it very forcefully. \u201cHe said: \u2018As far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019ll never be a top-flight player, nor even a second division player. Maybe third-rate, at best.\u2019 That was tough. Caen was the club I loved, the place I grew up.\u201d He got picked up by Cherbourg, a fourth-tier club a stone\u2019s throw from Valognes. \u201cOne day we played against Bordeaux\u2019s reserves. Their manager was Patrick Battiston, the former France international.\u201d Ars\u00e8ne Wenger once said that Battiston was the finest tackler he had seen. Battiston saw something he liked in Guilbert. \u201cHe took me to Bordeaux. Within three months I was his reserve team captain. Within six months I was part of the first-team squad. Then Caen called me. \u2018We made a mistake, would you come back?\u2019 I went back [on loan], then they paid to make the transfer permanent. I got this character because I always had that idea of proving to people they were wrong about me. Going back to Caen closed the circle. It\u2019s a nice story.\u201d His performances at Caen attracted English clubs. He turned down Brighton because he did not feel ready to move. Then, last season, he found out Villa were tracking him. \u201cSuso [Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda Pitarch, Villa\u2019s sporting director] came to watch a few matches and so did Olivier Monterrubio [Villa\u2019s scout in France].\u201d In January Villa sent their biggest delegation yet, with Suso and Monterrubio joined by the manager, Dean Smith, to watch Caen host Marseille. How did that go? \u201cI got a red card,\u201d says Guilbert, smiling and shaking his head at the memory. The first yellow was for dissent, the second, just after half-time, for catching a player from behind. Guilbert feared he had blown his chance with Villa. \u201cI asked my agent what was happening and he said: \u2018It\u2019s become complicated.\u2019\u201d But Villa came again and on the last day of the January transfer window signed him for a reported \u00a35m and loaned him back to Caen until the end of the season. \u201cAt the time Villa were 10th in the Championship and everybody said to me: \u2018Why are you joining them?\u2019 But I said I was not joining a league, I was joining Aston Villa.\u201d He widens his eyes as if to show the magnitude of the club. Then came a strange week in May. On the 24th he walked off the pitch in tears as a home defeat by Bordeaux condemned Caen to relegation from Ligue 1. Three days later he was in the stands at Wembley to watch his new club win promotion to the Premier League. \u201cVilla had invited me and my partner and of course I was happy we went up but, on the other hand, it was hard to celebrate. I had been totally invested with Caen and had this feeling of a job not done. I was with them for eight or nine years overall so you can\u2019t forget about going down so quickly. I popped into the [Villa] players\u2019 victory party for 15-20 minutes to congratulate them and then I went home and started preparing for this season.\u201d His preparations have paid off. Since his debut in August he has been excellent, solid defensively and a regular threat going forward. Even in last Saturday\u2019s 3-0 defeat at Manchester City he stood out. There he came up against the most challenging opponent he has faced to date. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say which is stronger between Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City but I would say Raheem Sterling presents the most challenges to a right-back. [Kylian] Mbapp\u00e9 likes to run in behind and Neymar goes infield a lot but Sterling wants you one-on-one.\u201d Next up are Man\u00e9 and Salah. \u201cYou think you know these players\u2019 strengths and weaknesses because you\u2019ve seen them in action so many times. But watching them and playing against them are completely different. The most important thing is concentration. Against them things can change in an instant. We were good at City for long periods but lost because our concentration lapsed momentarily. Now we have a chance to show we have learned from that.\u201d Speaking of learning lessons, where is that coach who told Guilbert he was third-rate at best? \u201cRetired? Unemployed? I don\u2019t know,\u201d says Guilbert. \u201cI hope he has a TV. Actually, I\u2019ll keep a seat for him at Villa Park. I\u2019m grateful to him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
