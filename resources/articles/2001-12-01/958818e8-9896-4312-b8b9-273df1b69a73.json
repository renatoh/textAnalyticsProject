They turned up to watch India bat and in particular one player - Sachin Tendulkar. It wasn't until after tea that the moment they had been waiting for arrived. They and tens of millions watching on TV will not just have been cheering a fine first Test hundred by Deep Dasgupte but the arrival on the ground of the little maestro himself. It was without doubt the loudest cheer of the day. Living with such huge expectation would break a lot of men but Tendulkar is special in many ways. Watching him practise at India's net session on Sunday was a lesson in itself. From putting on his thigh guard and pads to the selection of bat he used, he was meticulous in his preparation. He may previously have scored 7,112 runs at an average of 57.35 in Tests and 10,803 at 43.73 in one-day internationals but his attention to detail shows that it is not just natural ability that gets you to the top. Sunil Gavaskar said last night that he thought Tendulkar had \"the best technique that [he] has seen in the game, whether it be against pace or spin\". And that is quite a compliment from a man who scored 10,122 Test runs. When asked if Tendulkar had any weaknesses though he became rather sheepish. \"A couple,\" he said, before breaking into a smile. \"But I won't tell you, I have to live in India when you've gone home.\" The only ray of hope he gave was over-confidence. \"Sometimes he may go for a shot too early in his innings,\" were Gavaskar's last words on the subject. Weaknesses though, if over-confidence doesn't possess him, are something Nasser Hussain and his England bowlers will have to find today. I felt they bowled pretty well and stuck to their task yesterday but they will have to bowl even better today. Tendulkar is not a batsman I have spent a substantial part of my career bowling at - Brian Lara fills that role - but I must say I feel I played quite a role in making him the player he is. I was one of the England bowlers that helped ease him into Test cricket on India's tour to England in 1990. He was only 17 at the time but he scored his maiden Test hundred on that tour at Old Trafford. At that age we thought he was slightly susceptible to the short ball but that is something he seems to have overcome. I did get him out a couple of times though, both caught at second-slip to balls that seamed away off the wicket. I know this is a ball that would cause any batsman in the world trouble and that England are now playing on a wicket that is offering little or no lateral movement to the quicker men, but I feel this is the area you are most likely to get him out. Any batsman is tentative and edgy when he resumes his innings with a new ball that is only nine overs old. England's bowlers would best be served bowling a fullish length, on or just outside off-stump trying to move the ball away. It sounds easy enough but it isn't. Late in the day England tried to bowl slightly down the leg-side to him with a leg-slip. It is not a bad tactic and shows England have been doing their homework, as he was caught behind down the leg-side on India's recent tour to South Africa. His leg-glances were edged perilously close to the diving keeper on a few other occasions too. Tendulkar's first movement is to try to get his front foot forward outside the line of off-stump, reducing the chances of being lbw or bowled. However this does cause him to reach around his pads to play the ball down the leg-side and this increases the chance of an uncontrolled edge. I would wait until the new ball has lost its hardness before employing that tactic though. This does not give you a lot to work with but at least it is something - and if they do not come off you can at least enjoy the pleasure of watching at close hand one of the greatest players the world has ever seen. This is what the majority of the crowd turned up for yesterday and despite the loss of only two Indian wickets most will have left feeling slightly short changed. With Tendulkar on 31 not out, and looking to make up for an indifferent tour of South Africa, you can expect at least another 10,000 on the gate today if he is still in at lunchtime."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
