In doing so, it reveals its primary theme to be not race \u2013 as might have been surmised from the last series \u2013 but class, that most unfashionable subject in American art, and specifically the decline of the working class. Nicky Sobotka \u2013 the competent young dockworker with a girlfriend, a young child and not enough work \u2013 is the character that most clearly embodies this. In David Simon and Ed Burns's previous TV series, The Corner, we saw how the black working and middle class of the 1970s and 80s was gradually worn down in places such as West Baltimore to reach the state of dependence on the drug economy we see in The Wire. In series two, Nicky personifies a similar fall for the whites of the inner city. In this episode, his younger cousin, the volatile and unpredictable Ziggy, offers him a cut of a drug deal. \"Fuck that shit, Zig,\" Nicky replies firmly. \"I got work today.\" But gradually, as his hours get cut back even further and the amount of money to be made from dealing becomes more and more tempting, Nicky will slip seamlessly into the world of drug packages and dangerous street-corner \"beefs\" familiar to us from series one. The last series showed the police as something close to an occupying army in black estates; here we see that the white working class too views them as something close to an instinctive enemy. This series can be seen as Simon and Burns's elegy to the working class, and this particular episode (directed by Ed Bianchi) and last week's (Steve Shill) contain some lovingly shot images of industrial decline, long roads curving away from factories fallen silent, Nicky trying hopelessly to start his car as the camera pulls back to reveal an enormous, decaying landscape of smashed windows and dirty walls, all as broken and useless as Nicky's vehicle. The racial politics of this series are also interesting. Last week on this blog, Saptarshi Ray mentioned the scene where Bunk Moreland and Lester Freamon, two impressive, well-dressed black detectives, walk into the white, working-class bar as clear representatives of power and authority. In this episode, we meet White Mike, a Caucasian drug dealer, stamping his feet in the cold of a street corner, huddled inside an enormous blue fur-lined parka; this scene is followed immediately by one showing Stringer Bell, the black drugs kingpin, going to visit his boss, Avon Barksdale, in prison. Like Avon, he's treated like royalty by the prison staff. He wears a long, expensive-looking black coat accessorised tastefully with a grey and black scarf; even Avon wears a Department of Correction denim jacket that seems a cut above what the other prisoners wear. We have discussed on this blog the lack of racist banter among the white police officers, and how realistic or unrealistic that is. I argued that Baltimore's being majority black creates a different dynamic between the two races than that in the US as a whole, and the police force, as a racially mixed profession, reflects this. Series two does not shy away from showing us racism on the white-dominated docks, and even the celebrated \"You happen to be white\" scene where Nicky upbraids a white dealer for talking as if he's black (so successful, perhaps, because it speaks to a guilty conscience in the white viewer who ends each episode by happily murmuring the black slang to him or herself) definitely reveals an attitude of racial superiority and even contempt in Nicky. David Simon was speaking to the Hay festival on Saturday, and he touched on the issue of class. \"There's a whole nother America out there that doesn't know where the next paycheque's coming from, and there's a lot of great drama about that,\" he said. When he first became a newspaper reporter, he recalled, he was \"amazed that there were these two Americas and they were living side by side. All kinds of cultural stuff goes from one side to the other, but aside from that they're disconnected.\" He also explained why he and his colleagues wanted to deconstruct The Wire at the beginning of series two and start again in a new part of Baltimore. \"We wanted to construct the American city. This was a critique of a city that could not recognise its problems; we would have to parse the city slice by slice,\" he said. Simon was asked whether he felt that the show had had any positive impact in Baltimore on any of the problems it examined. \"No,\" he said. \"Sorry. There's a little Wire tour, and we've got one convention now \u2026 The only place where it might have had some impact could be: there are a few more people in America speaking bluntly about the war on drugs being 40 years of disastrous policy.\" But he said that that might not have been connected to The Wire, and it \"hasn't resulted in any policy changes\". Interestingly, considering our discussion about determinism last time I wrote for this blog, Simon was asked whether there was any hope in The Wire. He said: \"I think one of the reasons The Wire is watchable is it's not a cynical show when it comes to people. We were very careful about writing people in very basic human terms. Anything's possible on an individual level \u2013 Cutty, Bubbles, Namond \u2026 Sometimes you get to catch a break, sometimes you make your own break, sometimes a combination of the two.\" But he said the show was \"very cynical\" about the political status quo. \"It's not a war on drugs, it's a war against the poor, it's a war on the underclass.\" As for Theodore Dreiser, the 19th century American novelist I compared him to last time, Simon said: \"I like Dreiser, but the guy couldn't write a human being to save his life.\" He also recalled the time Martin Amis was criticised by John Updike for using the phrase \"I'm a police\" in his 1997 novel Night Train. Amis told National Public Radio that Updike \"should get a copy of David Simon's Homicide\". Simon, who was listening to the interview in his car, thought: \"Here are these actual literary lions arguing over some small part of a police procedural; it was the most exciting day of my life.\" He was more positive than he has been about British interest in The Wire, saying: \"What's happened in the UK with [The Wire] is inexplicable to me. Americans can barely understand that show. I'm starting to think you guys are not quite as serious a country as I had in my mind. It's a TV show! We're approaching 'Get a life' country here.\" He added: \"Apparently American dystopia plays better the further you get from it. You guys have more of an appetite for it than we do.\" Staying on Britain, he complained that MPs in the current expenses scandal were resigning over \"disappointingly little\". He said: \"When you guys have a scandal it's\u2026 I bring you tidings from a world of Enron and AIG. Jimmy Cagney said, 'Never steal anything small.' Chandeliers! They wouldn't be fit to call themselves American politicians.\" Favourite quote: After Wee-Bey explains to Avon that he is being victimised by a prison officer because he killed one of his relatives, one Ledontay, Avon replies: \"Ledontay? I can't even remember that one. We need a scorecard to keep up with your lethal ass.\" This exchange sets in motion an exceptionally tightly written subplot, which ends in the killing of many of the prison's heroin addicts, the further estrangement of Avon from his nephew, and eventually Avon's being allowed to get out of jail early. Running totals: Murders: up one to 24, with the murder by the Greeks of the shipworker responsible for the deaths of 14 prostitutes, as we saw last week. Here we see for the first time what the Greeks are capable of \u2013 a torture and murder almost as brutal as that of Brandon by the Barksdales last series \u2013 and also which one of them is really in charge. McNulty: giving a fuck when it wasn't his turn: up one to 12, as he presumptuously takes over Beadie Russell's case. \"What does the marine unit have to do with 13 dead girls in a can?\" she asks. \"Not a thing,\" replies McNulty. Drunk: up one to eight, as Jimmy celebrates landing his old boss with responsibility for solving the murders. Nobody wants them, it seems, not even Freamon \u2013 and he's practically a saint. Bunk drunk: up one to four, sharing a drink with Jimmy in the same scene. School of dubious parenting: still two. Omar stick-ups: still on five. As far as we know, he's still in New York. Herc fuck-ups: no sign of the knucklehead. Bubbles attempts to get clean: still on two; no Bubbles this week, either."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
