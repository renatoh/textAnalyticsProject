In his maiden speech to parliament in 2013, Taylor told a story about \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and a dispute over a Christmas tree at Oxford in 1991, when he was a Rhodes scholar at the university, mentioning that Wolf lived on the same corridor. \u201cI first encountered political correctness as a student at Oxford,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt was 1991, and a young Naomi Wolf lived a couple of doors down the corridor. Several graduate students, mostly from the north-east of the US, decided we should abandon the Christmas tree in the common room because some people might be offended. \u201cMy friends from Oklahoma, Alaska and Oregon explained this new kind of moral vanity that was taking hold in America. A few of us pushed back hard. In the end we won, because we were mainstream \u2026 [Our rights] are being chipped away by shrill elitist voices who insist that they know what is best for people who are not remotely like them.\u201d But on Monday, after a section of the speech was shared online, Wolf said she was not at Oxford in 1991. She said she \u201cloves Christmas\u201d and accused Taylor of antisemitic dog-whistling. \u201cI was a Rhodes Scholar in Oxford 1985-88,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cAngus Taylor recalls me in a fever dream at Oxford in 1991 among those warring on Xmas. I was in NYC. Plus I love Christmas, Hannukah, Kwanzaa. Flattered to be on this mythological hate list.\u201d In a follow-up tweet, the author highlighted Taylor\u2019s reference to \u201celites\u201d. \u201cCatch that anti-Semitic dogwhistle \u2013 elitist people \u2018who know what\u2019s best for people who are not remotely like them.\u2019 Referring to Jews like me whom Angus Taylor imagined to be among the warriors against xmas in Oxford in 1991.\u201d Wolf\u2019s first book, The Beauty Myth, was published in 1990, and she said she was \u201clong back in the US\u201d by 1991. A spokesman for Taylor said the minister did not say that Wolf was one of the graduates who had argued about the Christmas tree and was not referring to Wolf as one of the graduates. He also said Taylor \u201crejects any assertion he is anti-Semitic\u201d. \u201cIn fact, his own grandmother was Jewish,\u201d the spokesman said. The story about Wolf was repeated in embellished form in a 2014 profile of Taylor in the Australian Financial Review, and remains uncorrected. \u201cTaylor was awarded a Rhodes scholarship and went to Oxford University, where left-wing writer Naomi Wolf lived a few doors away,\u201d the AFR said. \u201cWhen she proposed banning the traditional Christmas tree, Taylor, a Christian, led a successful counter rebellion.\u201d Taylor is currently the subject of a New South Wales police investigation after his office relied on a doctored document to launch a political attack on Sydney mayor Clover Moore. In June, Wolf\u2019s latest book release was cancelled in the US and future versions corrected in the UK after she admitted live on air that it contained at least two errors. In an interview on BBC Radio 3, broadcaster Matthew Sweet pointed out that Wolf had misunderstood the historical term \u201cdeath recorded\u201d while writing her book Outrages. While Wolf believed it meant an execution, Sweet said it was a term that allowed judges to record a death without carrying out an execution. Wolf has said she was thankful for the correction, that it only affected two pages and did not affect the thesis of the book."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
