He went on to say that the most vulnerable in society would be worst hit, adding: \"It is likely that crime levels will go up.\" In reaction to this, the policing minister, Nick Herbert, said: \"I understand the Police Federation wants to make its case and protect every job, but we must be careful not to frighten the public.\" In July it was announced that crime in England and Wales fell by 9% last year to its lowest level since comparable records began in 1981. Mr Herbert commented: \"I think there is a little bit of a danger in politicians arguing about figures or latching on to figures and losing sight of the fact that people in their everyday lives, in their communities, when they go to and from work, there is a lot of crime around. This is too much a high crime country.\" The home secretary added to this claim by pointing out that there were still 26,000 victims of crime every day. So is it acceptable for the coalition government to scaremonger over crime when trying to score political points, but not for others when the impact of their cuts agenda is made clear? Miles Ockwell Arundel, West Sussex \u2022 Comparisons have been made between the coalition's proposed cuts and those implemented by Margaret Thatcher. One intriguing difference is that Mrs Thatcher prefaced her assault on public spending and the unions with handsome pay increases for the police, the armed forces and the judiciary. By contrast, as union leaders now threaten \"collective action\" and \"civil disobedience\", the police, the armed forces and the Ministry of Justice all face substantial cuts of their own. Brian Pollitt Glasgow \u2022 Who could argue with George Osborne's desire to get the public to suggest painless ways of saving money and increasing efficiency? Who could blame the BBC \u2013 in its new, government-friendly mode \u2013 for promoting his big idea in its interview with the chancellor? The trouble is, the big idea for selling off government surplus equipment has actually been operating for 17 years \u2013 and most effectively for the last nine (including online). The Ministry of Defence has several contractors, one of whom has a turnover of \u00a310m a year from the sale of such surplus. This newspaper worked with me when I was education secretary to establish an imaginative refurbishment scheme for used computers, which were then made available \u2013 prior to the big investment in new technology \u2013 to schools in the most deprived areas of Britain. Can we now presume we are going to get more of this re-running of what already exists? David Blunkett MP Lab, Sheffield"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
