Shame on me. So I asked my friend @Johnthecabby, who's also Top London Blogger, to send me a wish list of changes he'd like a Model Mayor to make. Here it is: 1. Zero VAT rating on the purchase of a new greener, cleaner Euro 5 taxi-cab (Mayor would need government assistance on this issue). 2. Rickshaws to be removed from the public highway &amp; placed within confines of the many large London parks. 3. Automatic provision of taxi ranks outsides bars, nightclubs and other venues. 4. The removal of all sub/satellite mini-cab offices in London. 5. The creation of a new London taxi board where all driver organisations and unions would sit &amp; create policies and ideas that could be placed before drivers, Transport for London and the Mayor. 6. One Badge, One Vote: give the silent majority a say on future policies developed by new London taxi board, TFL &amp; the Mayor. 7. Bigger better enforcement units to deal with illegal touting especially late at night. Your constructive views welcome, as ever...."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
