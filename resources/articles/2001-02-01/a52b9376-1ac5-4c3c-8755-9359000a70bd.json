In Colombo, for example, there has been no cosy introduction to cricket on the senior tour for young Jason Brown. He's been ferrying the drinks since arrival and in all probability he will have to wait until 1 March - after the first Test - for a proper bowl. The selectors opted for Robert Croft as their spin partner for Ashley Giles, trusting in Croft's greater experience and his batting potential, and the Welshman has been given every chance to get his game in order. Brown can only look on and reserve paceman Matthew Hoggard must be equally patient. In fact Duncan Fletcher and Nasser Hussain have left themselves just one decision to make prior to the first Test: whether to pick Michael Vaughan or Graeme Hick for the final batting slot. Vaughan had nudged ahead in this contest by scoring 57 accomplished runs in the first innings of the match against the President's XI - until yesterday when Hick, no stranger to the last-chance saloon, cracked 75 from 112 balls. Meanwhile Vaughan, caught sweeping, failed to score. Hick's innings restored England's control of the match, a dominance driven home by Darren Gough's evening burst of three for 15. England should win comfortably; the home side still require an improbable 306 runs for victory on the final day with seven wickets remaining. More importantly Hick's knock, coming after two failures on the Sri Lankan tour, may have prolonged his Test career. The temptation to restore Vaughan to the Test team is obvious. It stems partly from Hick's mediocrity in Pakistan. By contrast, in between his injuries Vaughan's temperament has impressed with vital innings at crucial moments at Centurion, Lord's and Headingley, all of which contributed to victory. Moreover the long-term view demands that Vaughan should be battle-hardened soon. The Australians are just around the corner; it would help if Vaughan was properly established in the team by then. And he is a marginally better bowler than Hick even if he's still seeking his first Test wicket. Yet my guess is that after yesterday Hick will prevail for several reasons. Firstly selectors by nature have a conservative streak; this may not be a bad fault. There is a place for loyalty provided it is not too misguided - they weren't too loyal in the case of Ian Salisbury, who was rightly jettisoned from the tour party. Moreover they know that Hick has the potential to dominate against spinners in a manner beyond Vaughan's capability. What is so infuriating is that this rarely happens at Test level, though Hick did hit a century against Murali and Co in England's last match against Sri Lanka at The Oval in 1998. The selectors may also be aware that Hick can't really be recalled again. The next drop is likely to be the last one. And there is one other factor. Hick, the most mild mannered of men, has never the less provoked so much vitriol in parts of the press that a human response from the decision makers might well be 'We're not going to yield to this stuff'. So they may stick by him longer than they would, ordinarily, have done. It will be an interesting decision and for Hick, at least, a crucial one. Otherwise England's batsmen appear to be acclimatising well to Sri Lanka. The cornerstone of the batting line-up in Pakistan, Mike Atherton and Graham Thorpe, have yet to reach 50 on the tour but no one will be too bothered about that. Yesterday both spent about two hours at the crease and were fluent enough. In the first innings Hussain hit his highest score for more than a year and Craig White has sustained the approach that was so effective in Pakistan. Marcus Trescothick is now a 'banker' and was allowed to rest during this game. There may be concern about Alec Stewart's frailty against the spinners. He was stumped for the second time in the match against the left-arm spin of Hettiarachchi. Meanwhile Gough, who delivered a few ill-chosen words to two of the Sri Lankan colts in the first match of the tour, wisely let his bowling do the talking in the final session. In a brisk five-over spell he disposed of three young Sri Lankans to set up victory for the tourists."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
