He was nonetheless removed from the House ethics committee by the speaker, Paul Ryan, made subject to investigation by his former panel and told to repay \u201cwhatever taxpayer funds were used\u201d. The New York Times reported that the Pennsylvania representative Patrick Meehan, a 62-year-old married father of three, was accused last year by \u201ca former aide\u201d of making \u201cunwanted romantic overtures\u201d. In an email to the Guardian, a spokesman said Meehan denied the claim. The spokesman added: \u201cThroughout his career [Meehan] has always treated his colleagues, male and female, with the utmost respect and professionalism.\u201d Citing interviews with \u201c10 people, including friends and former colleagues of the former aide and others who worked around the office\u201d, the Times said Meehan\u2019s former aide reached a confidential agreement that included an undisclosed payment from the representative\u2019s congressional office fund. The Times did not name the aide, who it said was left \u201cfeeling as if the settlement was not worth the emotional distress the process had caused\u201d. As a member of the House ethics committee, Meehan has been involved in investigations into numerous recent cases of alleged sexual harassment and confidential settlements involving members of the House. The Michigan Democrat John Conyers and Arizona Republican Trent Franks resigned. Blake Farenthold, a Texas Republican, and the Nevada Democrat Ruben Kihuen have said they will step down in November. A spokeswoman for Ryan confirmed that Meehan would step down. \u201cSpeaker Ryan takes the allegations against Mr Meehan very seriously,\u201d said AshLee Strong in an email. \u201cThe speaker is committed to rooting out sexual misconduct in the House and providing victims the resources they need.\u201d Strong added: \u201cThough Mr Meehan has denied the allegations, they must be fully and immediately investigated by the House ethics committee. Following a conversation with the speaker today, Mr Meehan will immediately submit himself to the ethics committee for review.\u201d Meehan was first elected in 2010. He has long been considered a top Democratic target in the forthcoming midterms as his suburban Philadelphia district was won by Hillary Clinton in 2016. The Times also wrote of Meehan\u2019s record in Congress that \u201che has sponsored legislation mandating the reporting of sexual violence, and he is a member of a bipartisan congressional task force to end such violence\u201d. Meehan\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cIn this case, the employee, represented by counsel, made certain assertions of inappropriate behavior which were investigated \u2026 every step of the process was handled ethically and appropriately.\u201d He added: \u201cAt Congressman Meehan\u2019s request, the congressional attorneys handling the case have asked the complainant\u2019s counsel to release all parties from the confidentiality requirements of the agreement to ensure a full and open airing of all the facts. \u201cThe congressman is hopeful that they will agree to this request for full transparency.\u201d Ryan\u2019s spokeswoman added that \u201cnew reforms going into place bar the use of taxpayer money to pay settlements, and so the speaker has also told Mr Meehan that he should repay whatever taxpayer funds were used to settle this case\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
