Most took to sea in rickety vessels, operated by unscrupulous smugglers unconcerned by the dangers to those packed on board. One particularly grim accident last year, in which more than 300 people were drowned, forced Rome into action, and the navy launched Mare Nostrum, a \u20ac29m (\u00a322.7m) a month humanitarian operation that patrolled to the borders of Libyan territorial waters looking for ships in distress. From Saturday that operation was officially wrapping up, replaced by Triton, a cheaper, far less ambitious European Union border patrol that people on the frontline of the refugee crisis say will cost lives. \u201cI am very worried, it\u2019s clear that with the end of Mare Nostrum there will be more deaths in the Mediterranean,\u201d said Luigi Ammatuna, the mayor of Pozzallo, where about 23,000 refugees came ashore in the first nine months of this year. \u201cI want to be the mayor who welcomes people fleeing war and devastation, not the mayor who receives corpses.\u201d The extraordinary influx is equivalent to more than quarter of his small town\u2019s population, but after meeting hundreds of desperate migrants off boats, and burying 66 who did not survive the journey, he has become an outspoken advocate for their rights. Many Italian politicians have argued that rescuing migrants encourages others to make the journey, an argument echoed by the British government when it refused to fund Triton, and makes traffickers\u2019 work easier as they no longer need to worry about boats reaching Europe. Ammatuna says that is no reason to leave people to die. \u201cFor sure this is giving more motivation for people to start the trip across the sea, but this is not a reason to deny them help, it is a humanitarian imperative,\u201d he said. Even if a smaller rescue operation stems the numbers of departures temporarily, it will do nothing to stop the tragedies in the Mediterranean, because most of those who travel in the death-trap boats are well aware they may not survive the journey but feel they have no choice. Arbout half of this year\u2019s arrivals came from Syria or Eritrea, a dictatorship that is one of the world\u2019s most secretive countries, UN figures show. Palestinians, rare voyagers before the summer, turned up more often after Israel shelled the Gaza Strip, and departures from Libya that almost stopped in 2012 rocketed again as the country spiralled into violence, the EU border agency Frontex said. \u201cAfter three years I asked for my passport to go home, but my company kept it so I would keep on working,\u201d said Amin, a 22-year-old who had been working in Libya legally and tried to go home before he was forced on to a boat. \u201cPeople were dying every day. Life was impossible.\u201d He spent four days at sea, two without water, and after a rescue by Mare Nostrum is now living in Pozzallo. \u201cI am so happy in Italy, there is no fighting, no death.\u201d Lucia Borghi from Borderline Sicilia, a group that offers legal and practical help to refugees, said: \u201cWhen they start their journey, they understand very clearly the situation, they know exactly what the risks are, but they have nothing to lose. If the [EU patrol boats] are now only monitoring a restricted area close to Italy, it is very probable that people will die.\u201d It is perhaps a sign of the scale of the crisis that nearly 1,500 people have been rescued by a charity set up to scour the sea after Pope Francis condemned \u201cglobal indifference\u201d to the refugee crisis. Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS) refuse to discuss the politics of doing a difficult and expensive job usually left to governments, but its director Martin Xuereb concedes Europe is going through \u201cunprecedented times\u201d. \u201cWe are fully aware that ours is not the solution, but while everyone is trying to find a solution, nobody deserves to die out at sea,\u201d said Xuereb. \u201cWe ask people to put themselves in the position of that person or child who feels compelled to make a journey.\u201d The international charity M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res, whose doctors treat new arrivals, has also warned that winding down Mare Nostrum will do little to deter most travellers. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say that the operation needs to stop,\u201d said Stefano di Carlo, head of mission in Italy. \u201cThese are vulnerable people who have fled war \u2026 many women and children. There are no alternative ways for these people to get to Europe, so they will try it, whether there is a life-saving operation or not.\u201d There are several problems with Triton, its critics say. It is less ambitious in scale, patrolling only around 30 miles off the Italian coast, with far fewer resources. It also has a different remit that could leave it floundering when faced with the worst tragedies. \u201cWhen you have search and rescue, you have to intervene immediately, within hours,\u201d said Chiara Favilli, a professor at Palermo University who is a member of legal group AGSI, which works and campaigns on immigration issues. \u201cTriton may do some search and rescue activities, but will not have that much capacity, so each time there is a crisis they may have to ask for the intervention of Italy, or Malta, or Greece, and while they are making a decision, people will die.\u201d The EU does not even know the scale of the potential tragedy, warns Leonard Doyle, spokesman for the International Organisation for Migration, part of the United Nations. The group began keeping track of people dying on migration routes around the world at the end of last year, when it realised that no one else was counting the dead. It has recorded more than 3,000 deaths in the Mediterranean this year alone, even while Mare Nostrum was operating, but its database is incomplete, and there has been little effort by governments to compile an authoritative record. \u201cIt seems to me there has been a focus on the wrong end of the problem. It\u2019s been on counting the number of people landing, not the number of people put on boats by smugglers in the full knowledge that they will sink,\u201d said Doyle. Amnesty International says that some of those smugglers were also hindered or captured by Mare Nostrum and will now be able to operate with more impunity. The wide-ranging navy patrols allowed the Italian authorities to arrest more than 300 people. \u201cIt has been the most effective organisation to prevent organised crime and save thousands of lives. I find it inhuman, illegal and morally controversial to stop it,\u201d said Italy director Gianni Rufini. \u201cRight now the weather will reduce the number of transits across the Mediterranean, but in a few months, when conditions are favourable again, we will see thousands of people drowning.\u201d Ships that evade the patrols can make large profits for traffickers. Old, barely seaworthy boats cost just a few thousand dollars, the fuel less, and there are hardly any costs for crew or supplies. Migrants pay up to $4,000 each, so a boat loaded with 300 migrants, like the one that went down last year, could easily net more than $1m. The monthly Triton budget to try to stop the trade is under $4m and the desperation that drives the trade is in no danger of drying up. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get on the boat,\u201d said Musa, a 24-year-old from Gambia who saw at least 10 people die on his crossing to Italy. \u201cI can\u2019t swim and I had watched on TV what happened to others before. I had no choice.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
