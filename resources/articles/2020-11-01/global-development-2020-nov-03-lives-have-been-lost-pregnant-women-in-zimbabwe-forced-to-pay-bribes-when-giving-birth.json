She struggled to another clinic in the country\u2019s capital. The midwives there were not ready to help her either. \u201cWhat did you bring us?\u201d one of them said, a subtle bribe request, as Katume\u2019s mother pleaded with them to be merciful. \u201cMy mother quickly realised that they were asking for money, and she handed $5 (\u00a33.90) to the one who appeared more senior. There was no receipt and all of a sudden I was taken to a bed in the delivery room,\u201d she said in court documents seen by the Guardian. As Zimbabwe\u2019s once enviable healthcare sector collapses under the weight of dilapidated infrastructure, a lack of drugs and poorly paid staff going on frequent strikes, pregnant women are being forced to pay bribes to get help with giving birth, with reports of babies being born in queues outside maternity clinics. The Zimbabwean constitution guarantees the right to healthcare, and, after her experience giving birth, Katume and another woman, Melody Mapani, took city authorities to court to force them to reopen 42 clinics. A high court judge this month ordered the council to do so, and ensure women get the services they need. In the court papers, Katume said her baby could have died had her mother not paid the bribe. \u201cThe midwives flatly refused to attend to me. My mother pleaded with them to be merciful. In the discussion, one of the ladies asked: \u2018What did you bring us, what\u2019s in it for us,\u2019\u201d Katume said. Her lawyers allege corrupt staff in clinics give priority to clients who pay in US dollars. \u201cSince only a few clinics are operational, this has resulted in rampant corruption from healthcare workers who are giving priority treatment to those paying US dollars which employers are pocketing,\u201d the lawyers said. \u201cThe violation of rights is ongoing and any delay in arresting puts the lives of Harare residents in grave danger, especially pregnant women,\u201d argued the lawyers. \u201cLives have been lost, especially of babies during the birth, some dying before birth owing to delayed or non-attendance by healthcare workers at these clinics.\u201d Many have resorted to back yard delivery homes or home deliveries, which increase the risk for the mother and child. The court documents also allege negligence and lack of care at the council clinics, with pregnant women reportedly being tossed from one clinic to another without due care. Under these circumstances women with pre-existing conditions risk losing their babies, as happened to Melody Mapani. She went from one clinic to another looking for help before suffering a stillbirth linked to high blood pressure, which hadn\u2019t been picked up on because a clinic had closed, according to the court documents. The women allege scores of pregnant women in Harare are being turned away at the few clinics that are open, while some endure long queues where social distancing is impossible. There are also cases of patients fainting while in long queues, unsafe home deliveries being done by unqualified people, and a thriving of a black market for drugs, the women said. According to the Zimbabwe Demographic Health Survey, while the trend in the past five to 10 years shows a decline, the estimated maternal mortality ratio for the country is still high, at 651 deaths per 100,000 live births. Zimbabwe\u2019s deteriorating health sector has worsened since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and suffered following a general strike by frontline workers. In June, seven babies were stillborn at Harare hospital after urgent treatment was delayed because of staffing issues. Local NGOs have called on the government to prioritise maternal health issues to reduce maternal mortality. The majority of deaths can be prevented if women receive the right care throughout their pregnancies and during birth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
