Terry Lloyd, veteran ITN correspondent, became the first media casualty of the Gulf conflict when he was killed on March 22 in what is believed to have been a \"friendly fire\" incident in southern Iraq. His ITN colleagues, French cameraman Fred Nerac and Libyan driver-translator Hussein Osman, remain missing, despite the valiant attempts of Nerac's widow Fabienne to persuade the British and US governments to investigate their disappearance. Paul Moran, a freelance Australian cameraman was also killed on March 22 in a car bomb attack in northern Iraq linked to the Ansar al-Islam terrorist group. Channel 4 News' award-winning foreign affairs correspondent Gaby Rado was found dead at a hotel in northern Iraq on March 30. His death was not thought to have had any direct connection to military action. Kaveh Golestan, a distinguished Iranian cameraman working for the BBC was killed on April 2 when he and producer Stuart Hughes stepped on landmines while filming in Kurdish northern Iraq. Hughes had to have his right foot amputated. Washington Post columnist Michael Kelly became the first American journalist to be killed in the war when he died in a Humvee accident on April 3. BBC translator Kamaran Abdurazaq Mohammed was one of at least 18 killed on April 6, when an American warplane bombed a Kurdish convoy travelling with US special forces. John Simpson, the BBC's world affairs editor, was hit by shrapnel in the attack. NBC's TV correspondent David Bloom suffered a fatal blood clot on the same day while travelling with US infantry outside Baghdad. His death appeared to have no direct connection to the conflict. Julio Anguita Parrado, New York correspondent for Spanish newspaper El Mundo, was killed on April 7 when Iraqi fighters mounted a devastating rocket attack on a US brigade headquarters south of Baghdad. Christian Liebig, a journalist for the German weekly magazine Focus, also died in the attack. On April 8, the media gasped when an American tank turned its fire on the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad, where almost all foreign journalists in the capital had made their base. The strike killed Reuters cameraman Taras Protsyuk and Spanish cameraman Jose Couso. Al-Jazeera cameraman Tarek Ayoub was killed by US air fire on the same day at the Arabic satellite channel's Baghdad HQ, which had been clearly identified to the US military. Argentine camerawoman Veronica Cabrera was the first female journalist to die during the conflict. Cabrera, a freelancer with Argentina's America TV, was injured in a car crash that instantly killed her colleague Mario Podesta. She was taken to hospital in Baghdad, but later died of her injuries. Even after the war was over, journalists continued to be killed or injured in Iraq. Richard Wild, a 24-year-old reporter who travelled to Iraq to fulfil his ambition to become a war reporter, was shot dead in Baghdad on July 5. It was not clear whether he had been targeted because he was a journalist. Jeremy Little, an Australian sound recordist working with American network NBC, died in a German hospital on July 6 after having sustained injuries when a rocket-propelled grenade hit a US military vehicle in a convoy he was travelling with in Fallujah, west of Baghdad. The killing of Reuters cameraman Mazen Dana, who was shot dead by US troops in August for filming outside an Iraqi prison, provoked outrage. Journalists who were with Dana accused US soldiers of behaving in a \"crazy\" and negligent fashion. \u00b7 Although he was not a casualty of the war in Iraq, James Miller, the British film-maker who was killed when he hit by a bullet from an Israeli tank in the Gaza Strip on May 2, will also be remembered by colleagues this year. Miller's family and Saira Shah, the journalist he was working with on a documentary for HBO at the time of his death, have repeatedly called for an independent criminal investigation into his death.
