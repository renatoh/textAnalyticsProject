Though the spells of frost have been short, there is no doubt that there have been few warm hours, if any, for the bird-bath in the garden has for ten days past been frozen. The ice has now been removed and the bath refilled, as it was pitiable to see the birds coming again and again for that sip of water that is as necessary to them as food. It is some time since we had so many days of dry weather. Those who have been hunting this week found the ground in perfect condition, and it was so this morning; the sod was firm and dry enough to ensure an absolutely safe foothold for the horse, and the weather was clear and pleasant. Last week a curious mishap occurred to a fox hunted by the Patterdale Hounds. They had cast off at Matterdale, and by the afternoon had driven a fox through the Helvellyn range to its north-western side above Thirlmere and to the valley of St. Sohn. Many dalesmen were now out, and the fox took its way over Fisherwife Rake and northward along the fell-top to Wanthwaite Bank, below which are the quarries. Here numbers of men were watching from below to see which way the pack would take when, to the astonishment of everyone, the fox came with a great leap right over Policeman Crag, a sheer drop of about 200 feet. It is seldom, indeed, that a fox makes such a fatal mistake. He no doubt knew there was one path by which he could descend safely, but perhaps the excitement had misled him. The accident some years ago to a policeman that gives its name to the crag was owing to a dense mist and occurred to a man who well knew the safe path."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
