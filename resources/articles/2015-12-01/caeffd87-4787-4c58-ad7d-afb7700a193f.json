In fact it had risen to $1.10bn (Trafigura to pay staff $775m in share bonuses, 15 December, page 27). \u2022 A prisoner who featured on a Grammy- nominated album made in a maximum security prison in Malawi and subsequently died was a woman, not a man as we had it in a story (Jailhouse rockers in line for Grammy award, 16 December, page 21). \u2022 An article about the boxer Tyson Fury described him as a \u201c6ft 9lb mountain\u201d. As one reader pointed out: that\u2019s one mighty baby. It should have read 6ft 9in (My wild night on the New York tiles with Tyson Fury, 12 December, page 1, Sport). \u2022 A feature about giving up meat incorrectly stated that \u201caccording to the World Cancer Research Fund, if you stop eating red meat, you\u2019ll also be avoiding the only convincing dietary association with colon cancer\u201d. In fact the World Cancer Research Fund says eating too much meat can increase your risk of bowel cancer. The Fund recommends that you should eat no more than 500g (cooked weight) per week of red meat to reduce this risk. Being overweight, drinking alcohol and eating processed meat can also increase your risk of bowel cancer (A New Year resolution that\u2019s good for you and the planet: stop eating meat, 15 December, theguardian.com). \u2022 An article about the Egyptian author Alaa al-Aswany said that he was \u201cinitially supportive of the current president Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi\u201d. To clarify: while Aswany supported the Egyptian military intervention against the Muslim Brotherhood as a means to restoring public order in July 2013, he did not vote for President Sisi in the presidential election in May 2014 and in fact campaigned on behalf of the socialist candidate Hamdeen Sabahy (Egypt shuts down novelist Alaa al-Aswany\u2019s public event and media work, 11 December, theguardian.com)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
