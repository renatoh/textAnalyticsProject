Smoky haunts offer 'da herb' in one-gram bags or individual spliffs to everyone from stoned hippies to retired first-timers in all manner of coffeshops - sleek lounge bars, gayclubs, cosy cafes and New Age retreats. Though the tourism authorities may be wary to admit that Mary Jane attracts more tourist attention than Anne Frank, the relaxed attitude to cannabis is one of Amsterdam's biggest draws. The police have long turned a blind eye and the coffeeshop owners get on with 'cannabusiness' relatively unchallenged. But all this could shortly change. Last week, the International Narcotics Control Board reported that the conservative coalition government plans to crack down on the coffee shop industry. By 2010, the city's culture of coffee and cannabis could even be extinct. But not only are Amsterdam's coffee shops part of the city's streetlife, they're also a mainstay of its tourism industry. Some two million Britons visit Amsterdam each year - they are not all coming for the Rijksmuseum, art galleries and the canals. Hash coffeeshops have been attracting fans of the 'wonderful' weed since 1972, when the first outlets took root in the city. Holland's current legal stance is that use of the drug is not illegal, but possession is against the law, though anyone caught with less than 30g is not prosecuted. Those over 18 can buy up to five grams in a coffee shop. 'Coffeeshops are just an ordinary part of the city scene, and that ordinariness in a way has its charm,' said Rodney Bolt author of the Cadogan guide to Amsterdam and the Randstad. He also believes they serve a useful purpose. 'Coffeeshops go a long way to demystifing dope, to keeping kids away from people who might try and sell them harder stuff, and to allowing police to keep an eye on things.' Although they avoid active promotion of cannabis tourism, a spokeswoman for the Netherlands tourism authority admits that, 'A small part of the tourism to Amsterdam is people coming for the coffee shops.' Bolt adds: 'Brits, and Americans especially,who are out for a little naughtiness see a smoke as part of an Amsterdam package along with drinking and an ogle through the red-light district.' But now, the government wants local authorities to reduce the number of coffeeshops, especially near schools and areas bordering other countries. It has also voiced its concerns over links between the coffeeshop industry and the illicit drug trade, drug-related crime and health and social problems. The number of cannabis stores in Holland has already dropped from 1,500 to 750 over the past five years. Nol van Shaik, one of Holland's leading coffeeshop owners, said: 'I had a meeting with the police in Amsterdam this week, and while they do not want to make using cannabis impossible in Holland, in Amsterdam they want to decrease the number of coffeeshops from 250 to 120, and will do everything they can to do so. If owners are caught breaking the rules, such as selling to under 18s, or advertising cannabis, they will close them down.' Closing down the shops could take away some of Amsterdam's unique charm, and may cause tourists to look elsewhere for their herbal holiday. A spokeswoman from STA Travel said: 'Tourists might look to other liberal places such as Copenhagen for that kind of holiday. They could become the new Amsterdams.' The permissive world of pot users Spanish high Where Malaga Legal position Though the law says selling cannabis is illegal, it is effectively decriminalised, and personal possession of up to five plants, seeds and cannabis for personal use is tolerated. According to Nol van Shaik, owner of 16 coffeeshops, including Willie Wortel's in Haarlem, just outside Amsterdam, and founder of the Global Hempmuseum, Haarlem. Why? 'It has a perfect climate for growing cannabis plants as it's in the hottest part of Spain. It's close to Morocco, from where much of the stuff is imported. There's been an explosion of shops selling equipment for growing your own plants, and most of them have a legal smoking corner. I'm going to open a members-only coffeeshop resort in the area this summer, with a shop, cafe and campsite, next year I'll add bungalows.' Van the Man Where Vancouver Legal position Cannabis used medicinally is legal, and possession of up to 15 grams has been decriminalised to a minor offence which can incur charges. According to David Bienenstock and Steve Bloom, co-editors of High Times, a specialist USA-based magazine for cannabis enthusiasts. Why? 'Vancouver is also known as \"Vansterdam\". That's because it's the only other major city in the world where you can smoke marijuana relatively freely. There are several \"smoke friendly\" Amsterdam-style coffeeshops there, such as Blunt Brothers and the Amsterdam Cafe. You can't purchase marijuana in the shops but you can bring your own herb and smoke it on site. There are also pot-friendly bed and breakfasts, and even tour groups dedicated to showing you the town in stoner style. Also, the city is surrounded by beautiful wilderness, and is close to world-class mountain sports.' Smoked Danish Where Copenhagen Legal position The cannabis market is illegal, but it is very rare to be arrested or charged for possessing small amounts. According to Chris Fowlie, head of the National Organisation for the Reform of Marijuana Laws in New Zealand, who toured the world to research cannabis regulations and culture. Why? 'In the middle of Copenhagen, in a former army barracks, is a 30-year old squat called Christiania of more than 1,000 people and whose most famous feature is a marijuana and hash marketplace. Governments have constantly threatened to close it but never succeeded. Pusher Street is lined by 20 wooden booths where dealers sell large bricks of exotic hash and baskets of marijuana from around the world.' Give us a kif Where Morocco Legal position It is illegal, but widely available and even the drug manufacturers are rarely prosecuted. Morocco is one of the world's leading suppliers. According to Shiona Jenkins, author of the Lonely Planet guide to Egypt. Why? 'Lebanon and Dahab in Egypt were historically the places to go in the Middle East, but there was a crack down in the Nineties, and though a lot of marijuana is still grown in the Sinai mountains in Egypt, it is difficult to get it. Morocco is the place people go to for cannabis now, there's lots of hash and kif grown in the mountains. It's also famous for all the kif-imbued literature, such as the writing by Paul Bowles.' But , please remember, it's really not very good for you ... A spokesman for the National Drugs Prevention Alliance (www.drugprevent.org.uk), one of the UK's leading drugs prevention charities, says: 'Our advice is don't take cannabis. Whether you smoke it, ingest it or insert it in unusual orifices it can cause physical health problems including head and neck cancers, as well as mental health problems such as psychoses and the onset of latent schizophrenia. People who take it are more likely to have intellectual, social and emotional problems, to drop out and be emotionally volatile in relationships. We know the Dutch authorities are taking the health effects more seriously and looking at their policies again, and Amsterdam is a wonderful place you can visit without having to take cannabis.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
