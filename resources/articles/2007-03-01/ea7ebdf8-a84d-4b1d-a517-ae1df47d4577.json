Call me cynical, but crying over a charity talent contest [Comic Relief Does Fame Academy] is taking it a bit too far. If it raises money for this great cause, then bring it on and more of it. Personal gain is not the name of the game though. And agreed, Mel was the only the one with real wit so why didn't viewers put their pounds on retaining the only real comic value? Eliana \u00b7 While allowing the celebs to pull in other celebs to spend their money ensured maximum cash to the Red Nose thing [The Apprentice], it's not really much of a business challenge, is it? The programme might have been a bit more interesting if the challenge had been more connected to the charitable aims of Comic Relief. Now, I'd pay money to see Piers Morgan trying to run a funfair in Kenya. Morgan really thinks he's catnip on screen, doesn't he? It's quite a trick to be so odious as to make viewers have sympathy for Alastair Campbell. simonsomething \u00b7 Organ Grinder will be donating 20p per comment from the live blogs tonight towards Comic Relief. MediaGuardianEditor \u00b7 Poor Anna Pickard, another Friday night in live blogging when, as previous experience has shown, hardly anybody will be reading. Free Anna! I used to get excited about Comic Relief when I was at school, but it's a bit of a curate's egg. Some of it will undoubtedly be great and some of it will be dire. I'm also put off by the serious segments of dying children and such like. I understand their purpose, but the fact is they bore me. Kelme \u00b7 Don't cry for me, Kelme, I give up one more Friday night not ignorant of the fact that no one will be reading it at the time, but surely *because* of that. After all, when they come back from being out, outside, out in crazy joyful places with their friends, they're going to wonder whether Lenny Henry shouted 'Hello Cardiff!' at about 9.45, and whether Cardiff responded with a suitably loud Welsh cheer - and all the while, I'll rest easy in my bed, knowing that they can log on, find out that critical information from my lost evening, and perhaps leave an apposite and erudite comment on the matter, like \"Who Carz anywayz U r a looza and hav no life, ana pikud LOL.\" And we can all be proud of them for doing so, because we'll know that their leaving that comment will give just a few more pennies to charity, what with the whole comment sponsorship thingo. Anyway, there might be people reading? My boyfriend's not going to have anything to do, is he? I hope, anyway. annapickard \u00b7 Piers Morgan is even more cringe- making than Paul Burrell and that is really saying something. MELANIEBELLAMY \u00b7 CR does The Apprentice was a perfect example of the celebrity reality genre . . . phenomenal casting, brilliantly shot and amazing reality content. terrywogan \u00b7 Sad to see Colin go - I thought his storming performance of The Boys Are Back in Town was his best yet (and certainly more fun than whatever songs Tricia and Barry autopiloted out). MyNameIsJames \u00b7 A fabulous book has been published in aid of Comic Relief, bringing together 100 hilarious stories from the UK's finest and funniest bloggers. I'm in it, as is GU's very own Anna Pickard. And just us two are enough to make you laugh till you soil yourself, so just imagine 98 other stories of similar clutch-your-sides comedy genius. So buy it now pleeeease - www.shaggyblogstories.co.uk. Thanks! I'll go now... Hfactor \u00b7 Blah, blah..get on with The Apprentice. Last night was compulsive viewing. Cheryl asking if Trinny was OCD, the blokes' gutted faces when the girls topped their total by over 200,000. Campbell and Morgan were treating Tim like an office boy and fighting like snarling kittens. mightywombat"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
