The American ambassador to Pakistan, Cameron Munter, visited the prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, at his hilltop residence in Islamabad where the men played down the significance of the leaked dispatches. Gilani said Pakistan's national interests \"would not be compromised by such mischief in any manner\", while Munter said: \"Working together, we will get past the WikiLeaks problems.\" But outside Pakistan experts in nuclear counterproliferation said the leaked cables exposed a serious threat of nuclear terrorism that western governments have deliberately played down \u2013 until now. \"The intersection of terror and proliferation is nowhere more evident than in Pakistan,\" said Mark Fitzpatrick of the UK-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. \"Officials have been talking about this for years.\" The Pakistani media was more concerned with the cables' political implications. Television stations highlighted reports that Gilani quietly approved of CIA drone strikes, in contradiction of official policy. \"I don't care if they do it as long as they get the right people. We'll protest in the national assembly and then ignore it,\" he reportedly said in August 2008. Journalists were also drawn to colourful descriptions of President Asif Ali Zardari \u2013 described as a \"numbskull\" by Britain's air chief marshal, Sir Jock Stirrup, and reports that the US pushed for the former president, Pervez Musharraf, to be granted immunity from prosecution. But the local media largely avoided the cables' more explosive claims about the role of the army, in particular allegations that Pakistani intelligence continues to covertly support the Afghan Taliban and the Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba. Prompted by warnings from US diplomats and Hillary Clinton last week, the army launched a pre-emptive strike against the leak before it went public. On Monday, a top general briefed senior journalists on the trove, saying Pakistan had \"transited from the most sanctioned ally of the US to the most bullied ally\". \"The real aim of US strategy is to de-nuclearise Pakistan,\" the Dawn newspaper reported him as saying. That nuclear capacity is precisely what worries Americans, and others. Shaun Gregory, a Bradford University professor who has studied Pakistani nuclear security, said that there are multiple chinks in the country's armour. \"The military elements of this are fairly robust. But on the civilian side, where the fissile material is processed and the weapons produced, levels of safety and security are much lower,\" he said. Worse again, the cables claim that the extremist groups that might want to seize nuclear material, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Afghan Taliban, still enjoy covert support from the military as proxy forces against India. Pakistani officials predicted the revelations would damage Islamabad's ties with the outside world. \"You have built them over the years and all of a sudden something gets out. It's top secret; it's classified; it harms the relationship,\" Wajid Shamsul Hasan, Pakistan's high commissioner to the UK, told the BBC. Some analysts said the cables only reinforced existing worries. \"We knew so much of this, I was surprised to find myself reacting with surprise. But it is different when you see something in black and white,\" said Zafar Hilaly, a retired ambassador. The most dispiriting element of the cables, he added, was that they showed that, nine years after the September 11 attacks, \"nobody seems to have a plan\". But for others it laid bare the thorny, often reluctant relationship between Pakistan and the US, as well as the perilously fragmented nature of Pakistani politics. Cyril Almeida, a Dawn columnist, said: \"They show just how dangerous the transition to democracy is in Pakistan, how powerful the army is, and how much clout outside powers wield.\" Nuclear experts said the cables exposed the limits of Washington's strategy of hushing its worries about Pakistan's nuclear security. \"What is surprising is that the United States doesn't have more leverage. We're not getting enough for our money,\" said David Albright of the US-based Institute for Science and International Security. \"Hiding the truth can't be the basis for a long-term policy.\" The wider question raised by the cables is whether the revelations will upset Pakistan's delicate balance of power. Almeida said they \"lay down a public marker about just how bad relations are between the various players\". \"It confirms that, far from being a place where any one player or institution pulls the strings, we have various power centres jockeying for power \u2013 with uncertain outcomes,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
