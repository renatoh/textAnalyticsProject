In March the company said an internal investigation had found a small number of rogue traders had created pricing errors in their positions through \"intentional misconduct\". It said disciplinary action had been taken. A month earlier, when pricing inaccuracies first came to the attention of senior management, Credit Suisse was forced to announce a $2.65bn (\u00a31.39bn) write-down. The episode - which centred on controversial investment structures known as collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) - was highly damaging for already fragile investor sentiment in the banking sector. The meltdown in the US sub-prime mortgage market last year prompted a flight from credit risk that caught the banks off guard. The past 12 months have seen write-downs from financial institutions totalling $270bn, precipitated by this flight from risk and lingering scepticism about the thoroughness with which banks have written down the value of assets. The fine against Credit Suisse would have been as high as \u00a38m had it not been for prompt action and cooperation by the bank. It is the largest penalty for a breach of FSA principles by a regulated firm. Specifically, the fine relates to supervision failures by management and the lack of trader monitoring systems and controls. The FSA declined to say whether it was disciplining the rogue traders identified by Credit Suisse's internal investigation. In March the bank said: \"These employees have been terminated or have been suspended and are in the process of being disciplined under local employment law.\" Likely action from the FSA against the traders is expected to turn on a technical point - whether they were directly authorised to trade by the regulator or whether they traded under Credit Suisse's FSA authorisations, in which case they will not face action. It is understood the relevant Credit Suisse traders in London were trading under individual FSA authorisations, but a number overseas were not. \"The penalty reflects our tougher stance on enforcement and our policy of imposing higher penalties to achieve credible deterrence,\" said Margaret Cole, the FSA's director of enforcement. \"It is imperative, particularly in more challenging financial conditions, that firms have in place appropriate systems and controls to manage their risks. The [Credit Suisse] subsidiaries here failed to take appropriate steps to control the potentially high-risk combination in the structured credit group's holdings of exotic products, opaque valuations and high leverage. The sudden and unexpected announcement of the write-down had the potential to undermine market confidence.\" In a statement, Credit Suisse chief executive Brady Dougan said: \"This incident was unacceptable to me and the executive board. It does not represent the high ethical standards of Credit Suisse. ... we have taken actions to implement a remediation programme to address the findings of our internal review.\" The second largest fine for a similar breach was \u00a34m against Citigroup in 2005 relating to European bond trading. The only larger FSA fine was a \u00a317m market abuse penalty for Shell's misstating of proved reserves in 2004."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
