I have been very lucky, I have been able to follow my passions, raise a family, work for change, see so much of this beautiful country. It hasn\u2019t always been a straight path, it has doubled back and gone off on unexpected angles. I work as an anthropologist and archaeologist on native title and cultural heritage projects. It has been a great blessing to be able to work for many different mobs, make connections with so many great people, help have their land and identities recognised. To be able to help people to connect. I come from a big family, and I grew up among many cousins, uncles, aunties, you name it. I am also a dad, I have three wonderful children, my first was born when I was 17. Raising them has been one of the toughest jobs, and the most rewarding. Family and mob have been central to who I am, it set the stage. But major characters in that play have been my depression and my sexuality. I have struggled with depression from childhood, and I am bisexual. For a man who was raised to be proud of my Indigenous Identity, I have been at times embarrassed about my sexuality and for many years kept it to myself. But having kids changed that, I wanted them to know who I was, and that whoever they are that I love them and am proud of them. What do you plan to focus on during your week as host of @IndigenousX? This week we will be tweeting about identity, Indigenous mental health, sexuality, and suicide. #BlackRainbow is a good place to start, it supports the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander lesbian, gay, bisexual, sistergirl and brotherboy, and queer community. You can find out more about their Start Some Good campaign here. In between I will be tweeting about my work and answering everyone\u2019s questions and hopefully having a few good yarns. What issues are you most passionate about and why? I was raised to be proud of who I am as an Indigenous man, but I have seen too many troubled with questions of their identity and the trauma that can rip a soul apart, a community apart. I was so secure in my identity that I didn\u2019t realise what colonialism had done to so many others, taking them from their country, communities, families. The continuing impediments put in our way to building stronger communities, families and futures. Who are your role models, and why? I\u2019ve gotta say my mum, right? My mum died over a decade ago in a car crash. She was the first to show me unconditional love, she taught me to be proud of being Gooreng Gooreng and about our country. But my mum struggled with depression and drug addiction. My mum was not perfect, she never needed to be, but she still taught me more than anyone else about the power of love, for that she is my number one role model. As an angry young man Steve Biko and Malcolm X inspired me. Biko teaching us that black is beautiful, fighting for his people and being killed for supporting the Anti-Apartheid Movement. Malcolm X, there is too much to say, just go learn about the man. Neville Bonner and Harold Blair, both pushed the boundaries of what an Aboriginal man could do in Australia, both were activists, both were from down the road from me. They made the struggle something I could understand, they made it achievable, they made it real. My old bosses have all inspired me, mentored me, been there for me. Valerie Cooms, Michael Williams, Jackie Huggins and Sean Ulm. If you know them you are lucky indeed, if you don\u2019t I hope they cross your path. What are your hopes for the future? My hope for the future is that the world becomes a more equitable place. That Australia as a nation embraces its past, good and bad, and commits to making the future a place filled with love and acceptance. Where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are respected, where there is justice, where there is truth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
