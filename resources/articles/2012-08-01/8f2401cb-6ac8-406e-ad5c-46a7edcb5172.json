England must submit their 15-man squad for the tournament in Sri Lanka by Saturday \u2013 the third day of the third Test against South Africa, for which Pietersen has been dropped because of his refusal to deny allegations that he was critical of his captain, Andrew Strauss, in texts sent to members of the opposition during the second Test at Headingley. Pietersen was man of the tournament when England won the world T20 title in the West Indies two years ago and made himself eligible again under the terms of his central contract with the England and Wales Cricket Board by rescinding his retirement from 50-over cricket in the statement he issued through YouTube on Saturday night. But the ECB has told him that before he is considered for selection in any form of the game he must address the issue of the allegedly derogatory texts. Pietersen by Monday evening had made no move to apologise or explain his conduct. The issue is complicated by the uncertainty over who received the texts, let alone the contents. South Africa's tour manager, Dr Mohammed Moosajee, confirmed their existence last week but has denied they were sent to Dale Steyn and AB de Villiers, and used that as a reason to avoid any further comment. Morne Morkel, a team-mate of Pietersen's at the Delhi Daredevils in the Indian Premier League, is now thought to have been the most likely recipient. Dr Moosajee also described them as \"friendly banter\", which does not square with reports that they included an offensive description of Strauss in Afrikaans and a prediction that Steyn would dismiss the England captain at Headingley. South Africa's manager said England had made no formal approach to the tourists about the texts, although that may depend on the definition of formal \u2013 and anyway the ECB has removed any need to conduct an investigation by leaving the responsibility with Pietersen. Senior ECB officials spent holding further talks with Pietersen's advisers in a desperate attempt to resolve the situation, which continues to overshadow England's build-up to Lord's \u2013 where Strauss will make his 100th Test appearance in a game they must win to avoid being displaced by South Africa from the top of the world Test rankings. But Pietersen's camp have added nothing publicly to the statement they released late on Sunday \u2013 in which he described his omission from the Lord's Test as \"demoralising\" but said: \"None of this constitutes the end of my career as an international cricketer.\" England's selectors \u2013 James Whitaker, Ashley Giles and their chairman, Geoff Miller \u2013 will have to meet before the end of the week to hit the tournament deadline of Saturday for submitting a final squad. Pietersen was omitted last month from the provisional 30-man squad that all countries were required to announce but there would be nothing to stop him being called in from outside that 30 given the unusual circumstances of the past few weeks. However at this stage there is no sign of that happening, and one well-placed source suggested it must remain \"highly unlikely \u2013 although you never say never\". South Africa's coach, Gary Kirsten, refused to concede that Pietersen's absence would boost his team's prospects. \"We don't focus heavily on individuals,\" he said, implausibly, from Lord's on Monday. \"We look to the team make-up and look at ways we can exploit that.\" England's players will gather at Lord's on Tuesday morning, with one of them due to speak to the media before they practise in the afternoon. Pietersen will inevitably dominate the agenda, even in his absence. There were hints of a determined attempt by the other senior players to stress their unity on Twitter throughout Monday as James Anderson led the congratulations for Matt Prior, Stuart Broad and Alastair Cook, who have all been nominated for the world Test cricketer of the year award that will be determined next month. The West Indies all-rounder Stafanie Taylor, meanwhile, has become the first woman to make the list of nominations for world cricketer of the year, an award for which Alastair Cook and Stuart Broad are also in contention."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
