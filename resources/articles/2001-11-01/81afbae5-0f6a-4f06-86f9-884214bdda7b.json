They say that it's harder than ever for them to calculate the exact costs for next summer's holidays following the 11 September attacks. Many scheduled airlines have already introduced extra charges to cover increased aircraft insurance and security costs and there could be more to follow. British Airways is now charging \u00a32.50 per sector travelled, which works out at \u00a35 for a return trip to Paris. Are they within their rights to do this? Abta tour operators are entitled to levy a surcharge as long as they absorb the first 2 per cent of any extra costs and it is more than 30 days before departure. This covers them in the event of currency fluctuations or a sudden increase in transport costs after a holiday has been booked. If the surcharge is more than 10 per cent of the holiday cost, you are entitled to a refund. UK tour operators want to bring their rules on surcharges in line with the rest of Europe where tour operators are allowed to impose a surcharge up to 20 days before departure and do not have to absorb the first 2 per cent. Previously tour operators could assess how much they would have to charge when they published their brochures, but 11 September has thrown the whole process into chaos. Aircraft insurance and security costs have doubled or tripled in the last two months. What happens if I have already booked my holiday for next summer? You won't have to pay any surcharges. Any new rules will only affect bookings when travel companies publish their next brochures. How much will I have to pay? Abta estimates that the increase will be less than \u00a310 per person based on aircraft insurance and security costs. Which tour operators are planning to impose surcharges? Most Abta tour operators, including Thomson, Airtours, First Choice and JMC, are expected to insert a new clause in their booking conditions in their next brochure editions stating that they have the right to impose surcharges if their costs increase. So will any tour operators offer a no-surcharge guarantee when I book? It's possible. Some tour operators may decide to use such a guarantee as a promotional tool. Will my travel insurance cover me? No. How can I avoid paying any surcharges? Book your holiday before the major tour operators publish the next edition of their summer 2002 brochures. They are due out just before Christmas. Are there any destinations where surcharges won't be imposed for next summer? You should be pretty safe with a self-drive tour to France or northern Spain. But book early - demand is expected to be very high for next summer. Where can I get more information?
