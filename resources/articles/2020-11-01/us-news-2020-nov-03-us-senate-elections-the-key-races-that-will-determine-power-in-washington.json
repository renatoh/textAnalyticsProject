Even if Biden defeats Trump, he will be unable to pass legislation on key issues such as healthcare, immigration and climate change unless the Democrats simultaneously seize the Senate, where the Republicans now have a 47-53 majority. The Democrats could pull it off. Democratic challengers in two states, Arizona and Colorado, appear to have a good chance in defeating Republican incumbents, while only one Democratic incumbent, in Alabama, looks especially vulnerable, according to the latest forecast from the Cook Political Report. The number of additional seats the Democrats need to win for a voting majority depends on who wins the White House, since any Senate tie of 50-50 is broken by the sitting vice-president. If Trump wins re-election, the Democrats probably need three states, in addition to Arizona and Colorado, for the majority; if Biden wins, the Democrats probably need only two more. \u201cProbably\u201d because there is enough time for races not mentioned here to shift and change the calculus. Where will those seats come from? There are seven races currently judged as tossups by the Cook Political Report\u2019s Senate forecasts. Top Democratic targets: the seven tossups The Democrats\u2019 top targets are Maine, North Carolina and Iowa. In all three races, incumbent Republicans appear to be weighed down by the unpopularity of Trump, while their Democratic opponents could benefit from high turnout among voters who wish to see Trump defeated. Broad demographic trends are also making trouble for Republicans nationally, with fewer women saying they will support Trump in 2020, suburban voters likewise abandoning him, according to the polls, and support for Trump falling off even among whites without a college degree. In Maine, the longtime Republican incumbent Susan Collins appears at last to have fallen out with the electorate, a majority of whom say they disapprove of Collins\u2019 vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh, Trump\u2019s second pick to join the supreme court. In North Carolina, the Republican incumbent, Thom Tillis, has defended Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, while a majority of voters say they supported the state\u2019s Democratic governor in his clash with Trump over public health rules for hosting the Republican national convention. While the Republican Joni Ernst had looked difficult to beat earlier this election cycle, she also appears to have suffered from defending Trump\u2019s pandemic policies, and challenger Theresa Greenfield has shown unexpected strength. With the campaign in its final week, there is still a chance that these and other races will change course \u2013 although time is running out for the Republicans to turn the tide."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
