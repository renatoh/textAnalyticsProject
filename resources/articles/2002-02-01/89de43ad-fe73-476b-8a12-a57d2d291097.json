It is well documented that Doug and I wouldn't go on holiday together but I don't think he can be entirely blamed for last week's break-up. Things must have got pretty bad for John to leave for Derby, who need miracles to avoid relegation. On the surface it doesn't look the greatest career move and I'm sure he won't have given up Villa lightly. His relationship with \"Deadly\" Doug presumably reached the point where he didn't want to go on with it, and it's obvious whose side the fans are on. Not that their protests are likely to force the chairman out. Aston Villa is Doug's life and he'd be lost without it. I think John became frustrated with what he saw as lack of finance, but from a distance he hasn't exactly shown the Midas touch. One or two, notably Bosko Balaban, cost reasonable money and haven't come off. When he wanted to reinforce, that may have gone against him. David Ginola is another who barely gets a look-in and his time at Villa Park highlights one of the main problems Gregory and Ellis had: too much of what went on there got out into the open. I was always careful to guard against that. I had my ups and downs with Doug but, even if I had a hell of a bust-up with a player or the chairman, I felt it should be kept behind closed doors. The outward show has to be unity. There are rumours that Ginola wasn't John's signing and that it was Doug who wanted him badly, but the bottom line is that the manager says who he wants. To me it always rests with the manager. Given any encouragement, Doug likes to get involved and he would see that as helpful to the club's cause. He loves to talk the game as if he's an expert and I'm told he once turned up at England training in an England tracksuit. Once, when there was a bit of flak flying about, he wanted me to write in my programme notes how supportive he was and how I would sometimes sound out tactical things with him. I couldn't stop laughing. I showed all the boys the fax he sent me with the details of what he wanted me to include. I said: \"Use him as a sounding board? Use him as an ironing board, more like.\" He always says he recommended Andy Cole to me when Cole was at Bristol City and that he had an agreement with their chairman before Cole went to Newcastle. But it's not something I or Denis Smith, who was Bristol City's manager, know about. We can't recall it. I always found Doug quite supportive if I wanted a player. He messed about a bit when we signed Dean Saunders from Liverpool, taking two weeks when it should have taken two minutes, but he does want Villa to succeed. He's spent a lot on the ground and the club are fairly solvent? Only Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal have bigger potential. I can understand Villa fans saying \"Leeds spend this and that\" but it's a Catch-22. Do Villa get into the Champions League first or splash \u00a340m to try to make it, with no guarantee of success? A player they most need is a top-quality, dominant midfielder. What I didn't realise was that John was the longest-serving manager Doug has had. The chairman would have stuck with him until the end of the season, so I don't think he can be criticised for not supporting him in that way. Whoever replaces John needs to be a strong personality and I think George Graham might be ideal, assuming his fitness is OK. The question is whether Doug might find it difficult if he took on George, who'd run things his own way. I worked with Doug on the principle that he employed me because of what I am and I wasn't going to change my style to suit him. As far as I was concerned, if he didn't like that, he shouldn't have given me the job. I knew what I was letting myself in for but I'd always wanted to manage Villa and was going to do it my way regardless. That's the key with Doug. He's not impossible to work with; you just have to ignore things and get on with the job."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
