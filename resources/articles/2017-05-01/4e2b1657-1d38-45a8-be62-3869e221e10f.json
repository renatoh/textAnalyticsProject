This should not be an afterthought. It is the one bright spot of hope in a desolate landscape and one that progressive media outlets such as the Observer should be championing. If 8 June sees Theresa May\u2019s Conservatives returned to power, then moderate Labour, Lib Dem and Green politicians should finally agree to form a single progressive party and stop splitting the anti-Tory vote, as they have done since 1945. A beneficial side-effect of such a realignment will be that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s hard-left Labour will not join and can become marginalised by a much larger and more electable force. The left-of-centre party activists have become detached from their voters \u2013 witness the haemorrhaging of support from the Lib Dems after entering a coalition with the Tories that was opposed by many and the way that lifelong Labour supporters are deserting Corbyn. What we need now is undeniable evidence to confirm that voters are crying out for change and political leaders with the backbone to put country before party and listen to them. David Vigar Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire \u201cBritain is a country of the European Enlightenment, so I have thought,\u201d writes Will Hutton in last week\u2019s newspaper. If only it was, we would not be descending into the mess of xenophobia and economic self-immolation that is the product and inevitable outcome of Brexit. But the Enlightenment was more at home in Scotland than it was in England. In recent years, there has been a debate about the identity of the English, a debate that never produced a definitive answer. The result of the referendum, however, has supplied one \u2013 we are not \u201cJohnny Foreigner\u201d. For at least four centuries, the British, dominated by the English view of politicians, politics, society and the rest of the world, have been seen and understood through a prism of the dominant culture of a Great Britain. It is a culture of pomp, an unelected upper house, titles signifying social differences and a \u201chow we won the war\u201d media. There has never been a whole commitment to the European Union. George Hudson Worcester I agree with Will Hutton. David Cameron lacked judgment in holding the referendum, but also to blame for the result was the lack of Labour leadership in promoting a vigorous campaign to expose the distortions and lies the Tories were using to blame Europe for the policies they had instigated, which had damaged schools, hospitals, social services and housing needs. Equally disastrous was the Labour leader\u2019s crass decision to take his MPs into the lobby to abandon the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, which had been deliberately designed to prevent opportunist governments from taking advantage of electoral swings to benefit their own party. He could have stopped Theresa May in her tracks by opposing her and prevented her from gaining the 67% majority required to change the act. Instead, he not only faces the self-devastation of his own party, but, even worse, it gives the Tories untrammelled power to do as they wish for the next five years, uncontrolled by the slender overall majority the party currently enjoys. Charles Tyrie Nottingham Hasn\u2019t Will Hutton anything cheerful to say? I\u2019m depressing myself enough think about the political and economic state of the nation without him making me feel even worse. Can\u2019t the Observer start a pre-election section full of humour, something to let readers feel a momentary surge of happiness and, shall we say, enlightenment?
