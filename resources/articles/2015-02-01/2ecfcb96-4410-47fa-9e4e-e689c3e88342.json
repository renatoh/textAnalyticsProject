Starting next month, visitors will no longer be able to buy small, $7 trays of fish to feed dolphins directly. The company will instead sell $15 packages that will include touching the dolphins under a trainer\u2019s supervision. SeaWorld Orlando is the last of the three SeaWorld theme parks in the US to allow the public to feed its dolphins poolside. A spokesman told the Orlando Sentinel the program is similar to ones offered at its other two US locations, in San Antonio, Texas, and San Diego, California. \u201cWe made this change to elevate the guest experience,\u201d SeaWorld spokesperson Aim\u00e9e Jeansonne Becka said via email. SeaWorld no longer permits reporters to interview representatives over the phone. \u201cThis new program is for those who would like to interact with the animals in an even more up-close and personal way, and have a reserved time and opportunity to do so.\u201d Experts say the move could be an effort to limit bites by dolphins, which has happened occasionally throughout the exhibit\u2019s existence, or to bring in more revenue as attendance declines. \u201cI actually think it\u2019s an improvement in the situation,\u201d said Naomi Rose, a marine mammalogist with the Animal Welfare Institute who has lobbied against dolphin and orca captivity. \u201c[It\u2019s] certainly not what I want \u2013 I want the whole thing to end.\u201d The theme park chain has been the subject of intense criticism since the 2013 documentary Blackfish. The film explored whether captivity is appropriate for killer whales \u2013 no matter the circumstances \u2013 after a star trainer at SeaWorld\u2019s Orlando park was killed by a whale in 2010. Her death also led to a complaint by trainers to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The dolphin-feeding program has also faced criticism. Animal rights groups have campaigned against the exhibits since the 1990s, when \u201cpetting pools\u201d and public feedings became popular. The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society and Humane Society of the US issued a report on the topic as early as 2003, pointing out that feeding throughout the day by members of the public led to both obese and underweight dolphins, because some animals would become more aggressive than others. Rose said it was also common for foreign objects to be dropped in tanks, leading to one dolphin developing zinc poisoning from consistently eating pennies. \u201cThese dolphins were at the edge of the pool with their mouth agape, and they were absolutely shaking with eagerness to get a fish,\u201d Rose said. \u201cIt was like watching a row of starving people being taunted with donuts hanging over their heads.\u201d \u201cBasically, dolphins are bored out of their skulls in captivity,\u201d said Mark Palmer, associate director of the International Marine Mammal Project at the Earth Island Institute. \u201cWe have terrible problem with dolphins in captivity eating all kinds of garbage, plastic.\u201d In 2012, video of an eight-year-old girl being bitten by a dolphin while feeding the animals at the Orlando park went viral. At the time, a spokesperson for the theme park told ABC News that the company they \u201cregret\u201d the experience, but that such bites are \u201cfew and far between\u201d. The company has also struggled financially. In early 2013, SeaWorld\u2019s corporate parent SeaWorld Parks &amp; Entertainment went public with a $2.5bn valuation, but stock has consistently slid with declining attendance numbers. In August 2014, on the heels of a poor quarterly report, the stock price slid by almost one-third to $18, and hasn\u2019t rebounded to its price at initial public offering. Year over year, attendance at the parks has declined from 8.9 million visitors to 8.4 million, according to the most recent financial release from the third quarter of 2014. SeaWorld owns 11 theme parks in the US, but has recently announced its intention to open parks in the Middle East and Asia by 2020. \u201cClearly 2014 has been a challenging year, but I am confident we are taking the necessary steps to address our near term challenges and position the company to deliver value over the long term,\u201d said Jim Atchison, CEO and president of SeaWorld Entertainment Inc, in a statement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
