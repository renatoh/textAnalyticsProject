Under new controls modelled on Uefa's licensing system, clubs could be banned from transfers, forced to sell players or forced to sell assets if they fail a new \"going concern\" audit. The Premier League's chief executive, Richard Scudamore, said new rules would also force clubs to make public any shareholding of more than 10% and to declare their ultimate ownership. \"It's very hard to argue that clubs aren't effectively 'owned' by a much wider group than those that happen to legally own the shareholding,\" he said. \"We should know and the public should know and the fans should know who owns their club.\" Clubs are already forced to disclose those details to the Premier League board, but it will now make them public as part of a raft of proposals designed to reassure government and fans that it is taking concerns around the financial sustainability of the game seriously. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport said it was \"encouraged\" by the Premier League's 30-page submission, which was approved by the 20 clubs and will be voted on at their next meeting. The DCMS will put pressure on the Football Association and Football League to submit responses by the end of the month. However, the culture secretary, Andy Burnham, is likely to be disappointed that the Premier League's response fails to deal explicitly with the question of whether leveraged buyouts, such as the Glazer family's purchase of Manchester United in 2005, which loaded the club with \u00a3667m in borrowings, are harming the game. That was one of seven questions he asked the governing bodies to address last October. \"Acquisition debt is only available to those whose assets are worth lending against in the first place,\" Scudamore said. \"Clubs have been managing debt for 20 years. They are also able to adjust their cost base.\" The Premier League has been at odds with the FA over the issue since last autumn, when the FA chairman, Lord Triesman, warned that the debts of some top clubs were too high. \"The word 'debt' is like an onion,\" said Scudamore. \"The minute you start to strip off the layers, your eyes start to water because it gets harder and harder to grip, because it's complex. The people best qualified are directors of companies, accountants, banks.\" The new financial measures, modelled on the Uefa licensing system and designed to assess whether a club is likely to remain a going concern for the duration of the coming season, will act as a last resort if other new measures fail to act as an \"early warning system\". Clubs will be forced to demonstrate that they have no ongoing debts to Revenue &amp; Customs or to other football clubs. The majority of Premier League clubs already pass the tests . The overhauled fit and proper persons test, to be applied to all directors or those with a stake of more than 30%, has been widened to ban any prospective owner who has been convicted of any crime with a sentence of more than one year, as well as the list of so-called \"honesty\" and \"football\" offences that automatically attract a ban. Scudamore said the Premier League had examined overseas sporting bodies and the regulation of banking, defence and media in drawing up the new rules. The robustness of the league's fit and proper persons test has risen up the agenda in recent years as overseas owners have multiplied. The debate coalesced around the former Manchester City owner Thaksin Shinawatra. The debate over the future of the game is being played out against an ongoing battle between the FA and the Premier League. \"We are working on a detailed response to the secretary of state's questions,\" said an FA spokesman. \"The content has been discussed at board level and will be discussed again later this month. We have the whole of the game to consider, not just one area.\" Today, the Premier League will unveil its answers to Burnham's questions over competitive balance and home-grown talent. It is expected to suggest a variation on the existing Uefa rule for its club competitions that a certain proportion of each squad must be composed of players developed in England."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
