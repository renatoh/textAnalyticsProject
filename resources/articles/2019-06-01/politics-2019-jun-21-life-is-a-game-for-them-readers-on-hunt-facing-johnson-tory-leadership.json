I did not vote for Theresa May in 2017. I voted for the Bollocks to Brexit party in the EU elections last month. I have no vote in the Tory leadership election. The Tory party do not have a majority in parliament. I am disenfranchised, angry and hoping that Boris will crash the Tories before he gets a chance to crash my country. Roger Butler \u2018They have never truly grown up. Life is a game for them\u2019 It seems that these characters are more concerned with demonstrating good spirit, a stiff upper lip and carry-on attitude than creating jobs, security and wellbeing for the citizens of the UK. They have never truly grown up. Life is a game and the person who dies with the most wealth and power has won. It is going to be a long and difficult journey for the UK out of this mess. There is a need for a fundamental change of culture in UK politics. TheDanishVIking \u2018Perversely I\u2019m hoping that Boris Johnson wins\u2019 Perversely I\u2019m hoping that Boris Johnson wins. It is the most likely outcome. If he becomes PM then he will have to face the reality of Brexit and that will lead him down the exact same path that Theresa May went down, only in a very much shorter time. Johnson will inevitably realise that the only way the UK can proceed with Brexit is to sign up to the withdrawal agreement so he is going to have to get that through parliament again. It will be fun to watch. If Hunt was in the same position the Brexiters will all be saying he\u2019s really a remainer and he\u2019s sold them out. It is a lot more difficult for them to say that about the most significant figure in Vote Leave. kafkafan \u2018So the pantomime continues\u2019 So the pantomime continues. We now have Flashman taking on Mr Bean. I can think of little more depressing than these two fantasists promising unicorns yet again. They know they cannot deliver but their electorate are so detached from reality they cheer them on. Guess what? Reality is coming your way with a vengeance. Enjoy the show while you can. Sowester \u2018You can have the man who made up the \u00a3350m a week for the NHS or the man who made a mess of it\u2019 What a great choice the Tory members have left to choose the party leader and prime minister. You can have the man who made up the \u00a3350m a week for the NHS and made a mess of his job as foreign secretary or you can choose the man who made a mess of the NHS leaving it with record waiting lists, vacancies and his own NHS lie about crushing the junior doctors to make the health service great at the weekend. Has anyone experienced this improved service? I doubt it. Amit Patel \u2018British politics is in a very sorry state\u2019 During my almost 70 years, the Tory party has gone from being a pragmatic, broad church to an ever narrowing sect of fanatics and chancers. It is therefore both depressing and apt that in what I hope will be their final descent into irrelevance and electoral defeat, they have such a disreputable, privileged useless chancer in Boris Johnson the hot favourite to take over as their leader. British politics is in a very sorry state. My hope is that out of this, the forces of pragmatism and common sense will regroup and be ready to pick up the pieces. With the Tories going to hell in a hand cart, and Labour dazed and confused, we need something and someone to rally round - and fast. fortyniner \u2018Boris is going to be PM and that is more or less a dead certainty folks\u2019 The only reason motor mouth Boris is going to be PM - and that is more or less a dead certainty folks, so do pour a stiff drink or three - is so that the Tories will hoover up all the votes that Farage would otherwise get if he made good on his threat to form a party to run at the next GE. Yes, that\u2019s right, the nation is yet again being held to ransom by the kind of miscreants that favour Farage. Wasn\u2019t this what first spurred Cameron on to hold the fucking referendum in the first place? BabylonianSheDevil03 \u2018Johnson will be a dreadful PM\u2019 As an Irish ciitzen, European and a friend of the UK, a country with a lot of strong characteristics and good people, I want to say how appalling it is that a chancer like Boris Johnson ends up as PM. Brexit will be bad for the UK and it will be terrible for the ROI, through no fault of the Irish. It\u2019s like having a neighbour burn down their house. Handing the final choice back to the members of the party undoes whatever democratic value there is in the party leader being chosen by elected MPs. They might as well hand the decision to the current customers of Costa Coffee in a randomly chosen town or the passengers of carriage 87 on the 08.45 to Doncaster. Johnson will be a dreadful PM. He might very well get the crown he\u2019s been aiming for his entire life but he\u2019ll be known as the man who dropped it and fouled up. Around his neck will hang the responsibility for a no-deal Brexit and the crisis it causes to the UK which almost certainly means the break up the UK and a return to violence in N Ireland. bertnairobi \u2018The party now is toast\u2019 This election, laying bare the very real frailties of the candidates and the Conservative party has only one conclusion. The Tories are not fit to govern and the party now is toast. If the Tories stay in government any longer the UK will be broken and we will become a rogue state, totally in the hands of the USA and despised by the rest of the world. So sad. So dispiriting. So divisive. Graham Taylor"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
