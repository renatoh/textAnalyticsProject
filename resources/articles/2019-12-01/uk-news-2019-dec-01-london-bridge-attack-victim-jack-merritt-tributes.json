The death of the 25-year-old was confirmed on Saturday by his father, David, who said his son would not \u201cwish his death to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences or for detaining people unnecessarily\u201d. It came as Boris Johnson said the system of automatic release from prison was flawed. Merritt, a course coordinator for Learning Together, a programme run by the University of Cambridge\u2019s Institute of Criminology, had been at Fishmongers\u2019 Hall next to London Bridge on Friday when 28-year-old Usman Khan launched the knife attack. Merritt and one other person were killed and three others injured. Khan, who was shot dead by police, had been arrested in December 2010 and released on licence in December 2018, wearing an electronic tag. David Merritt posted on Twitter on Saturday: \u201cMy son, Jack, who was killed in this attack, would not wish his death to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences or for detaining people unnecessarily.\u201d He added: \u201cCambridge has lost a proud son and a champion for underdogs everywhere, but especially those dealt a losing hand by life, who ended up in the prison system.\u201d He said the Cambridge community was in shock. An interview has emerged in which Jack Merritt spoke to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Law in Action podcast about his work helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk. He said: \u201cOur students in prison often have a very firsthand, very real but also nuanced idea of how the law works, and also a very good sense of where there is a lack of information, a lack of knowledge, and know which areas of the law could do with clarification \u2026 areas they have seen people go through the prison system not understanding and they to do research which will help people.\u201d Emilee Hopper, who said she had been friends with Merritt at school, said he was \u201cone of the kindest people I\u2019ve come across and a beautiful soul\u201d. The rapper Dave, whose brother Christopher Omoregie is serving a life sentence for murder, said Merritt was \u201cthe best guy\u201d and news of his death was \u201cone of the most painful things\u201d. He said he had \u201cdedicated his life to helping others\u201d and it was \u201cgenuinely an honour to have met someone like you\u201d. Dave, whose Mercury-prize-winning album was influenced by the topic of rehabilitation therapy and the effects it can have, said he would \u201cnever ever forget\u201d everything Merritt had done for them. Merritt was also interviewed by the legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg for the BBC in February. He described him as \u201ca fine young man, dedicated to improving people\u2019s lives\u201d. In response to his father\u2019s comments, people who knew Merritt shared their thoughts on social media, with one individual paying tribute to his \u201cmagnificent dignity and generosity\u201d. Jamie Bennett, a former prison governor and research associate at the University of Oxford, tweeted: \u201cSo sorry for you and your family. Jack promoted progressive reform and his spirit continues to inspire.\u201d Dr Hannah Quirk said: \u201cI taught him at Manchester and wrote his reference for Cambridge. He was an exceptional student and a lovely young man. I am so sorry for your loss.\u201d Serena Wright, a lecturer in criminology at Royal Holloway University, said: \u201cDavid, I knew your son through Learning Together and I loved him to pieces \u2013 he was the sweetest, most caring and selfless individual I\u2019ve ever met. The warmest heart, always with time for anyone. Completely irreplaceable \u2013 I will mourn his loss greatly and honour his memory.\u201d Caroline Sanders also paid tribute to Merritt and revealed she had planned to work with him on a prisons initiative. She tweeted: \u201cI am extremely sad today to learn that Jack Merritt died at the Learning Together event in London yesterday. I didn\u2019t know Jack well but had spoken with him and planned to work with him in one of the prisons on a LT project. My heart goes out to his amazing team.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
