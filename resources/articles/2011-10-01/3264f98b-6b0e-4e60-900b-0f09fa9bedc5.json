George Shaw, the shortlist's sole painter, has created a new work titled, mischievously or not, The Same Old Crap. But, as the annual exhibition opens for only the second time outside of London, and for the first time beyond the Tate family of galleries, Baltic's chief curator praised the shortlisted artists as \"thinkers, makers and doers\", who, while covering a broad range of artistic genres, \"share an attention to detail that is really important to them\". Laurence Sillars said: \"A lot of people, when they think of the Turner prize, are back in 1995, thinking about shock and awe and sheep and beds. But these artists have a very considered, very careful, almost humble approach to materials.\" The shortlisted artists are Shaw, Karla Black, Martin Boyce and Hilary Lloyd \u2013 respectively a painter, a sculptor, an installation artist and a video artist. Shaw's landscape paintings, rendered entirely in Humbrol enamel paint \u2013 which is normally used to decorate model aeroplanes \u2013 depict the postwar Coventry housing estate where he grew up. Here are boarded-up shop fronts, creeping housing developments built on muddy brownfield sites and a sinister semi-urban wood dappled with rubbish and dominated by a blackened tree that someone has attempted to burn. There are a lot of shuttered windows, padlocked gates and impenetrable fences in these paintings, but no people. Flashes of background colour turn out to be urban impedimenta such as bins for dog droppings. The Same Old Crap actually depicts the rubbled ruins of a former pub. Shaw is a chronicler of England's messed up, scummy edgelands. Sillars said: \"His work is so popular because people feel safe with it. But there's always something that's not quite right about them, something off-kilter. They are oddly unsymmetrical, things often don't compositionally quite work. Parts of them almost disappear into abstraction. The trees are aggressive. The sky's strange.\" A real bin, crazily angled, is also a feature of an installation by Glaswegian Martin Boyce. \"I expect,\" said Sillars, \"that we will get the odd apple core in that.\" Tissue-paper leaves sprinkle the ground and \"trees\" \u2013 whose trunks are the pillars of the gallery \u2013 shed gentle shade through aluminium foliage. The space feels like an urban park but this is contradictory, because nothing is naturalistic and the language of Boyce's installation is drawn from a modernist, concrete garden created for the 1925 Exposition des Arts D\u00e9coratifs in Paris. Boyce has even created special grilles for the air vents in his gallery, which is surely a first for a Turner prize exhibition. Fellow Glaswegian Karla Black is responsible for another Turner first: the use of Lush bath products in her sculpture. (The purveyor of highly scented toiletries actually sponsored her for her exhibition at the Venice Biennale this year, where she represented Scotland.) Bath bombs are scattered at the base of her giant assemblage of scrunched sugar-paper, which is coloured over with pistachio-hued chalk. There are sheets of clear plastic brushed with yellow and green acrylic paint, which peels off the surface like old nail varnish. A hanging sculpture of polythene coloured in ice cream-toned powder paint looks distinctly edible. Sillars said: \"It is a combination of colour, texture and smell. It envelops, subsumes you \u2026 the work really makes you want to touch it, prod it, test it.\" He added quickly: \"But please, don't do that.\" The final artist on the shortlist is Halifax-born Hilary Lloyd, who works in film and then uses the equipment of the process \u2013 screens, projectors, trolleys \u2013 to create a sculptural environment. A new work for the show, Floor, is a three-screen video in which the camera plays over a shape eventually recognisable as a shadow on the floor, simultaneously innocuous and sexually charged. \"She is interested in how images are constructed and in modes of perception,\" said Sillars. \"She is questioning how we see things, and showing how images are constructed.\" Lloyd's work, said Sillars, also had a handmade quality, despite the hi-tech: the images are wobbly, sometimes blurred, and edited in the camera, with no fancy post-production techniques used. Godfrey Worsdale, director of Baltic and one of this year's judges \u2013 who also include curators Katrina Brown, Nadia Schneider and Vasif Kortun, chaired by Tate Britain director Penelope Curtis \u2013 welcomed the prize's migration to north-east England. \"It's a national prize and it ought to have a life outside the capital,\" he said. He expects at least 80,000 people to visit the exhibition between its opening on 21 October and 8 January. The winner, who will receive \u00a325,000, will be announced at a ceremony at Baltic on 5 December. The prize will return to Tate Britain, London, in 2012, and will travel to Derry in 2013."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
