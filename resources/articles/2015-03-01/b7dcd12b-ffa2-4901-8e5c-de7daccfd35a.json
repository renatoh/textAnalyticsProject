The pair have become great friends since Ben Haim made Charlton his eighth English club by joining from Standard Li\u00e8ge last summer. \u201cWe just clicked,\u201d says Church. \u201cWe drive in together and get on really well. Saturday is going to be strange.\u201d \u201cYes, the first few minutes will be strange,\u201d agrees Ben Ham. \u201cBut then we are going to be big enemies for 90 minutes.\u201d Saturday is when Ben Haim and Church will confront each other in a European Championship qualifier that could carry huge significance for their respective countries. Israel are top of Group B after winning their first three matches and will be bidding to rack up a fourth consecutive victory in a qualifying campaign for the first time in their history. Wales are currently in second spot, a point behind Israel thanks to two wins and two draws from four matches. Victory would do either side a power of good on their quest for the qualification that their nations crave. Wales, as none of their fans need to be reminded, have not been to a major tournament since the 1958 World Cup. They qualified for that thanks to a play-off victory over Israel, who had topped the Asian and African qualifying section without playing a match because opponents boycotted them amid the Arab-Israeli conflict. Politics has inevitably influenced Israel\u2019s football history. The country still competed in the Asia-Oceania confederation when they reached their only major tournament \u2013 the 1970 World Cup \u2013 but they were ejected from that confederation four years later following a proposal by Kuwait. After decades of improvised solutions the country was granted permanent Uefa membership in 1994 and began competing for a spot in the European Championships, but the closest they came to a big tournament was in 2006, when only goal difference deprived them of a World Cup play-off spot. Ben Haim was part of that squad but says the current one is better. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing for the national team for 12 years and this is the first time that I feel like we are really a group together and not individuals,\u201d says Ben Haim, explaining that the synergy fostered by the manager Eli Guttman has helped the country surge 60 places up the world rankings in the last three years to their current standing of 26. The country has some gifted players \u2013 Bibras Natkho is a skilful midfielder who helped orchestrate CSKA Moscow\u2019s Champions League victory over Manchester City earlier this season, while Eran Zahavi of Maccabi Haifa is a rampaging midfielder with an eye for goal, and the striker Omer Damari, who plays his club football for RB Leipzig in the German second division, is the top scorer in the campaign so far, with five goals in Israel\u2019s first three matches. But Ben Haim says Israel\u2019s dynamism, determination and fluency are what make them so formidable. \u201cThe togetherness is a big part of our game and is our strength. You\u2019ve had bigger players in the past playing for the national team but I think this is a really strong group. I can say that for sure. The players really get on well together. We showed that in the previous game and I hope we can continue.\u201d The previous game was a 3-0 home victory over Bosnia-Herzegovina, who, when the draw was made, were the favourites to finish in the two automatic qualification berths along with Belgium. But the Bosnians have won none of their first four matches, which is why Israel and Wales sense there is a real opportunity for at least one of them to grab. The anticipation for this match in Israel is such that tickets sold out as soon as they went on sales three months ago. Ben Haim has warned his friend Church that he is in for shock when he encounters the atmosphere at the 31,000-capacity Sammy Ofer Stadium in Haifa. \u201cThe atmosphere, they have to accept, is something that you have never seen in England,\u201d says the 33-year-old. \u201cThe media, people in the street, everyone is talking about this game. It\u2019s going to be a huge game for us. I think that we have all the country behind us so obviously we want to make people happy. We want to put some smiles on people\u2019s faces in Israel. Because sometimes they went through a difficult period, and football is the best way for us players to help the people. So we are looking forward to doing that.\u201d Wales earned a valuable 0-0 draw against Belgium in their last away match and Church says that one of the keys to Wales\u2019 strong form is that the manager Chris Coleman has ensured that their yearning for qualification is not so intense as to cramp their style. Neither Israel nor the high stakes will intimidate them. \u201cI don\u2019t think we put too much pressure on ourselves,\u201d says Church, who explains that even Gareth Bale manages to channel his energies in an insouciant way despite the enormous expectation on him to deliver performances befitting his stature as the world\u2019s most expensive player. \u201cHe loves playing for Wales and plays with freedom and confidence. The manager gives him that and he gives that to all of us. That really helps us play without fear and with the fans behind us that has given us a massive lift, and that confidence has shown on the pitch.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
