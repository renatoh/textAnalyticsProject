Realising that even if you were free, you've got no friends to go for a drink with probably rates quite highly. Along with the crashing realisation that even when you finally free yourself from the office, there's a whole flat's-worth of chores piled up to do at home. And you need to put your dry cleaning in. Or, even, chuck your moth-eaten rags currently passing for workwear, and spend a precious weekend afternoon trawling the shops for alternatives. It's one thing being a bit busy at work (who isn't?) - but being so busy that you don't have time to actually run your life is quite another. Lucky, then, that a whole industry has sprung up to help you with this very problem: cleaners, personal shoppers, people to go and buy birthday presents on your behalf. They're all there for the hiring. But can you really pay someone to get you a life? I call Cary Whitley, author of Secret Services: Your very own pocket concierge. Whitley reckons that when it comes to considering buying in some assistance, it's all about working out what would make the most difference to your life. \"I think everyone has their 'can't do, won't do' list,\" she says. \"Personally, I can't do ironing, but for everyone it's something different.\" But what if your \"can't do, won't do list\" includes paying other people to look after your chores? Do any of us really work hard enough to justify hiring help - shouldn't we just feel guilty because we're not better organised? Not according to Whitley. \"We all work too many hours, and if you have got family as well, your time becomes very split,\" she says. \"You just have to delegate some of these things out.\" As it happens, I'm supposed to meet my sister-in-law for a birthday drink tomorrow night and have to choose somewhere good to go and buy her a present. I've done chocolates and soap sets, and I can't help feeling that I have to try a bit harder this year. Problem is, I have absolutely no time in which to do so, lunch hours being things that only now exist in dreams. I start with Texperts, a mobile-phone question-and-answer service. \"Good present for 30-year-old sister-in-law?\" I text. The answer comes back straightaway: \"A good present for a woman of this age would be a nice watch. The price can vary from \u00a360 to \u00a32,000 depending on the brand.\" Hmm. I'd still have to go to the shops. And a watch is not really an earth-shattering idea. Instead, I call Ali Nester-Smith at Happy Box, who tells me that if I give her an hour and a price range, she'll come back with suggestions. I choose a package and they'll do the rest. Sorted (and you don't pay extra for the service). But if I'm not going shopping tonight, I have absolutely nothing to do and, crucially, no one to do it with. The worst bit about working long hours isn't the never-ending mountain of washing - it's that your friends get tired of you always cancelling, and stop inviting you out. I need some new friends. Fast. So I log on to CitySocialising.com. The idea is simple: you register, choose from a long list of events by area and type of activity, and voila! - you go off and meet your new pals. It's free to use, with a small fee per event (\u00a39 for the one I'm going to), or you can pay monthly and go to everything for free. I'm booked in to meet my potential new friends at Bar Chocolate in Soho. As I approach the bar it suddenly occurs to me that I am actually choosing to go and meet a roomful of strangers who have only one thing in common: that they are going to meet a roomful of strangers. Yikes! It's enough to make anyone nervous - but I take a deep breath and head over to the CitySocialising posse (I know it's them because they have big signs on the table). I'm greeted by Alberto Santangelo, 33, an Italian working in London for Yahoo and one of the volunteer \"hosts\" for the evening. After I've been introduced to everyone, dodged the guy who tells me that the strip poker doesn't happen until afterwards (I'm sure he's joking, but still), it's time to get down to some serious small talk. Santangelo says that he joined CitySocialising because he was new to London and found it difficult to make new friends outside work. \"I consider myself very sociable, but I found it difficult to make new friends here,\" he says. \"With CitySocialising I get to do things that I probably wouldn't do on my own, like going to the Tate on a Sunday or for dinner after a busy day at work. It gives you the ideas and reasons to get out of the office, or off your sofa at home.\" Hapi Reeping, also 33, who moved down to London from Sheffield six years ago for work, has made plenty of friends - and met the man who is now her fiance at an event. \"I've been a member of City-socialising for nearly two years,\" she says, \"and this year things have really picked up with spin-off groups forming and more regular members, so you can chat easily to people you have already spoken to at [previous] socials.\" Everyone is very friendly, and while most people are single, everyone seems keen to stress that it's about friendship, not romance (which would explain why Reeping still comes along). In fact, they all seem to be having a great time. On the other hand, I am finding the whole thing a bit embarrassing. I usually love parties where you don't know anyone, but with everyone sitting round a table rather than up on their feet, it feels a bit like speed-dating. I realise I might have been better off choosing an event where people were coming together to do something I like doing, like going to a gallery or walking, so after a couple of hours I make my excuses and head off. Having learned the rather disappointing lesson that I'm maybe not cut out for instant-friend events, I decide to focus my efforts on the ones I already have. Problem is, when you spend your life with the nose to the grindstone, nights out tend to focus on the same, boring places. So I call Tim Badham, the director of Inner Place, a company who, for \u00a325 a month, can do everything from telling you where the cool places are, to securing hard-to-get tickets and introducing you to current members - ready-made super-cool friends. Badham is reassuringly knowledgeable. After asking a few questions about what sort of night it's going to be, he suggests the Burlington Club for early evening drinks, followed by dinner at Cocoon and then, if we're really going for it, clubbing at Paper. He assures me he'll confirm all the reservations and guest lists. \"You shouldn't have any trouble getting in, so long as you turn up looking smart and not too drunk,\" he says. I make a mental note. Left to my own devices, I'd never choose somewhere so swanky (actually, let's be honest - they'd never let me in). I suddenly feel like I've been let into an exclusive club. Which, erm, I suppose I have. Now I just need to find a few hours in my working week so I can enjoy the benefits of my new and fantastically organised life. Which may just be the problem. That and my bank balance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
