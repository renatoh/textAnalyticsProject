At the Ball Park, the Cincinnati Reds are playing the Texas Rangers, while at the US Bank Arena next door Carrie Underwood is making the latest stop on her global tour. Fans spill together through the muggy streets, a mingling of scarlet baseball jerseys and tan cowboy boots. This is Underwood\u2019s first tour since 2016, a huge two-hour, 60-date monolith of a show in support of last year\u2019s album Cry Pretty. Reaching UK arenas on Friday, it features a hydraulic stage, multiple costume changes and fearsome pyrotechnics, and it will carry her from Greensboro, North Carolina, to Detroit, Michigan, via the Glastonbury festival this weekend. The most successful winner of American Idol, triumphing in the TV talent show\u2019s fourth season in 2005, Underwood has since recorded six albums, sold over 65m records, won seven Grammys, and earned more than $83m (\u00a365m). She is beautiful and blonde, and married to a retired ice hockey player: at first glance an unlikely addition to the Worthy Farm lineup. When we meet backstage after the show she is out of her costume but still in her stage makeup \u2013 teary glitter circles smudged beneath her eyes. \u201cI got us wine!\u201d she announces from the sofa, pouring a large glass of cabernet sauvignon. \u201cThis is actually a treat for me because normally I go straight to my bus, and I have a crying baby.\u201d Underwood\u2019s second son, Jacob, was born in January, and now he, her four-year-old, Isaiah, and her husband, Mike Fisher, have joined her on tour. \u201cI actually kicked my husband out of the bed and he sleeps on the couch up front,\u201d she says of their onboard sleeping arrangements. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot easier to wake up in a moving bus and grab the baby and feed him.\u201d She says she has puzzled over how to adapt her set for Glastonbury, deciding to largely play the hits, \u201ctry to keep it eclectic\u201d and perhaps bust out an Aerosmith cover. It must be a strange time for such a quintessentially American artist to be visiting the wider world, especially one who is white, southern and religious. \u201cI feel like more people try to pin me places politically,\u201d she says carefully. \u201cI try to stay far out of politics if possible, at least in public, because nobody wins. It\u2019s crazy. Everybody tries to sum everything up and put a bow on it, like it\u2019s black and white. And it\u2019s not like that.\u201d She cites as an example the reaction to her recent single The Bullet, which looked at the long-running emotional impact of a shooting death. \u201cImmediately people said \u2018Oh you have a song about gun control!\u2019\u201d she sighs. \u201cIt was more about the lives that were changed by something terrible happening. And it does kind of bug me when people take a song, or take something I said and try to pigeonhole or force me to pick a side or something. It\u2019s a discussion \u2013 a long discussion.\u201d She grew up in small-town Oklahoma, where like most families they kept guns under the bed. \u201cWe had one stop light, one school,\u201d she recalls. \u201cChoir, band, football, basketball and baseball.\u201d Her parents, a teacher and paper-mill worker, drove her to other small towns in a homemade costume to compete in talent shows. \u201cThe savings bond I would win wouldn\u2019t cover whatever we spent on gas to get there,\u201d she remembers. When she was 15, she landed a development deal with a record company and got to record in Nashville, though it came to nothing. \u201cI just got my braces off, my acne had cleared up decently \u2026 but we had no idea what we were doing,\u201d she says of herself and her band. She went to college to study communications, joined a theatre group and found for the first time in her life a feeling that \u201cthis is a safe place, we can sing and it\u2019s OK here\u201d. Apart from the out-of-town talent shows, she had largely kept her voice to herself. \u201cI was more guarded with singing anywhere near where I grew up,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s that fear thing: what will \u2018they\u2019 say? What if \u2018they\u2019 laugh at me?\u201d In 2005 she used her parents\u2019 dial-up internet to register for American Idol. \u201cI thought: why not?\u201d she explains. \u201cBecause then I figured at least the door will be shut and I could stop wondering. I could stop thinking \u2018what if?\u2019 And then I could just come home, and graduate and get a job.\u201d I wonder whether, performing before thousands of people in vast arenas, she still worries about what \u2018they\u2019 might think when she\u2019s singing. \u201cA lot of times I feel like I\u2019m alone,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m obviously aware of people being around me. But it\u2019s like I\u2019m in the song alone on stage.\u201d It is a good place. \u201cI like to be alone. My husband is probably the only person this planet I could\u2019ve married \u2013 my mom, when I told her I was engaged, was even like \u2018I just never really thought you\u2019d get married.\u2019 And so I feel like when I\u2019m alone and singing and I hear nothing but music, it\u2019s a nice place to be.\u201d A recent study found that lately country music has moved away from its familiar subjects of hardship and heartbreak towards party songs. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of songs that aren\u2019t actually saying too much,\u201d she says. \u201cFun songs to listen along to; party vibe.\u201d She pauses. \u201cIt makes my skin crawl when I hear somebody say \u2018Gurrrl\u2019 in a song, you know?\u201d Underwood prefers the traditional themes: the woman wronged, the sorrow worn. She will stand looking immaculate in a pretty frock, singing about hard times, being cheated on, drinking, messing up her unfaithful\u2019s car. \u201cI hope people know you gotta have a little crazy in ya!\u201d she laughs. \u201cI\u2019ve got long blond hair and I like glitter \u2026 But there\u2019s a little crazy in there, and I like that to come out every once in a while. I went through a phase where I killed a lot of people\u201d \u2013 she mentions the Blown Away album in which the body count included Cupid hunted down with a shotgun and an alcoholic father taken out by a tornado. \u201cI have no idea why, but I wanted everything to be cinematic and dramatic. This album, things were a little more on the emotional side.\u201d Last autumn, as she launched Cry Pretty, she spoke openly of the experience of suffering three miscarriages in the course of two years, and how that loss coloured many of the new songs, capturing the time when \u201cI was still trying to do my job and put on a smiley happy face and be Carrie Underwood. And then I\u2019d go home and fall apart.\u201d The response to her speaking openly about miscarriage has been deeply moving. \u201cIt\u2019s something that people don\u2019t really talk about,\u201d she says. \u201cEven people who are my friends and I know well, after I talked about it were like, \u2018My gosh, me too!\u2019 And I feel like it\u2019s something I should\u2019ve known about them.\u201d She takes a moment. \u201cI think you feel silly being so attached to something that you knew about for this long,\u201d she says, and holds up her fingers a short distance apart. \u201cBut I still feel it, you know. I mean it took me a while to be able to sing certain songs and be able to get through them without really going there. It doesn\u2019t go away. Ever.\u201d Today she finds singing songs such as Cry Pretty and Low \u201cdifficult\u201d but \u201ctherapeutic\u201d. \u201cI guess you wait for things to stop hurting at some point,\u201d she says gently. \u201cBut letting yourself go there ... other people that are going through the same thing, it kind of connects you to them. I will always mourn those children, those lives that were a shooting star, a breath of smoke, but I have Jacob, and he is incredible, he is the sweetest little baby. At the time it was awful, and it still hurts, but it\u2019s kind of like OK, I have this.\u201d Underwood\u2019s producer, David Garcia, says the number one question she gets asked is whether or not she genuinely writes songs, \u201cor does she just show up and Instagram the whole time?\u201d Underwood not only writes, she also co-produced this record \u2014 an anomaly in the male-dominated world of country music. \u201cI mean, I get it: if you were a songwriter in Nashville, and 90-plus per cent of artists are male, are you going to go into your writing session and write a song for a woman?\u201d She looks resolute. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d She pours one last glass before she heads to the bus and the crying baby. \u201cBut we do it all. In high heels. I\u2019ll be waking up at God knows what time in the morning feeding my baby \u2013 no one else can do that, and I\u2019m proud of that.\u201d Carrie Underwood is at the Birmingham Arena on Friday 28 June, Glastonbury on 29 June, then touring the UK until Thursday 4 July"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
