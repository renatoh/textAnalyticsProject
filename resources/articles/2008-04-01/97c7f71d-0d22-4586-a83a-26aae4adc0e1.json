Time after time we cut away from the action at the inaugural match of the Indian Premier League - of which there was, counter-intuitively, far too much - to hear a smug man say: 'We can't make you immortal and we know you don't really want to think about this, but one day your luck could run out... when that happens...' A nasty change from 'could' to 'when', accompanied by some truly terrifying images of slates falling off untended roofs at pace on to a garden seat very recently occupied by a laptop user. All of this delivered at treble the volume of the cricket commentary, so liable to cause death by deafness. To perish watching an advertisement for life insurance before you could purchase any of the advertised life insurance... how off the pace is that? Watching the Twenty20 - or T20, as it is now known in the manner of F1 - I fell yet further behind the times. I adore Test cricket for its variety and subtlety; T20 offers a diet of more of the same and the same only more so. I enjoy peace and quiet; T20 offers noise and commotion. So much hype and hyperbole that I wanted to hibernate. Andy Bull, on our website, typed: 'OHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGOD It's about to start!' Meanwhile, I was making myself a cup of coffee and scrabbling round for pen and paper. The first over, satisfyingly, involved no runs off the bat. Shortly thereafter matters deteriorated, the chief culprit being the Kolkata Knight Riders' Brendon McCullum, who was the first scorer in the IPL, then hit the first four, the first six (topped over third man), the first fifty, the first century and the first 150 on the way to becoming the first man to score 158 not out. An exhausting number of firsts punctuated by a deadening number of sixes. 'It's become a joke, really,' said Sunil Gavaskar as yet another ball delivered by the Bangalore Royal Challengers 'travelled the distance'. This may be the Achilles' heel for T20: the better you play the game, the more ridiculous it becomes. The spectator rapidly becomes anaesthetised to the action. There's no history, there's no context, and there's no contrast. Who cares whether the Knight Riders (easy victors here), the Royal Challengers, or the Super Kings win, although obviously the Super Kings merit a measure of support for being the last remaining sports team named after a cigarette length. Otherwise, it all seems rather fake and forced and superficial. Even the cheerleaders were air-bussed in from the Washington Redskins. Perhaps the same mob will show up at Lord's when the World Cup is played there. If so, might I suggest they wear club colours and perform in bacon-and-egg bikinis. The cricket played on Friday was good, but in Kerry Packer's World Series it was of the highest quality and intensity, yet I cannot remember a ball of it. Of course, this was before global subscription TV and Packer wasn't even on Radio 4 long wave. Perhaps enough people will tune in to the Norwich Union-sponsored revolution to ensure the capitalists turn a profit. Perhaps enough Indians will show up to see it live to satisfy sponsors and owners. T20 could indeed one day become the world's baseball, but I'll be astonished if the IPL conquers America. will.buckley@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
