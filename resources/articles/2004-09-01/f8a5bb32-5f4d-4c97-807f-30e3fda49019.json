Chairman Sir Stuart Hampson said the group had set \"a cracking pace\" in its first half and he was looking forward to the second half - which includes the crucial Christmas season - with confidence. The group, which is a partnership, recorded \u00a32.5bn in sales in the six months to the end of July and trading profit climbed 22% to \u00a3116m. Pre-tax profits, boosted by one-offs such as property gains, were ahead 80% at \u00a376m. Sir Stuart said: \"Things have been coming together rather well.\" He warned against further interest rate rises, however. \"We don't see any reason for it. It is not an overheated market in retail terms.\" Comparative sales at John Lewis rose 4.6%, despite price falls. \"Deflation is a fact of life that we have to live with now. Electricals prices just do not go up. Increasingly it is the same for fashion. It is tough for retailers but good for shoppers.\" Branded women's fashion, linen, beds, audio and TV goods were \"storming along\". The Oxford Street store achieved a 6% sales increase in the first half, but Sir Stuart insisted that the impact of the congestion charge - which John Lewis campaigns against - was not wearing off. \"That figure now includes Sunday opening and, compared with two years ago, we are still 2% behind.\" The partnership is fighting an extension of the charging zone, which would take in its revamped Peter Jones outlet in Sloane Square, London. Some \u00a3100m has been spent on refurbishment and sales are up 16% since its June reopening. New department stores are planned for Trafford, Manchester, followed by Lisburn, Northern Ireland, and Cardiff. First-half results at Waitrose suggest it is still winning customers from ailing upmarket rivals J Sainsbury and Marks &amp; Spencer. Comparative sales were ahead 3.7%. Of the 19 Safeway stores acquired in the north, the seven so far converted had shown there was big demand for Waitrose outside its south-east heartland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
