Sliding in the polls, all now depends on Labour calling home its volatile voters. Yesterday both Blair and Brown hammered out the come-home theme of social justice, promised as the core of the manifesto. But Tony Blair has far to go to cajole the recalcitrant refuseniks. Polls find 75% of Conservatives certain to vote, but only 50% of Labour supporters. How well can they predict turnout? Professor Anthony King says: \"It's not hard to predict, it's impossible.\" Some won't vote because they think Labour will win anyway - so why give Blair an extra fillip? Others have sunk into media-induced \"They're all liars\" cynicism. I get sulphuric emails scorching with detestation of Blair in a molten stream of consciousness. But many others are thoughtful and pained. Labour's more abrasive defenders castigate all refuseniks as the Hampstead and Islington well-heeled who can trouser tax cuts under the Tories while keeping their consciences pristine in the dinner-party world where saying the right thing matters more than delivering to poor children and pensioners. But it's a waste of breath trying to shame back luvvies who find Labour no longer cool - or chase after the kind of leftists who shout betrayal at any Labour government and got their disillusion in so early that they didn't even vote in 1997. However, many refuseniks are agonised, not smug. Take Daniel, a 30-year-old research chemist who emails in praise of the good Labour has done: \"But I still have difficulty forgiving Blair for the war. I'm a long-standing supporter and I have campaigned in the last two elections. I can see the benefits the government has brought to scientific research and Brown's redistribution. I just find it very hard to forgive not only the war itself but the whole way we went about it. Please answer this question: how do you reconcile yourself to voting Labour after Iraq?\" So here is how. Iraq stands as Labour's gigantic error, fighting George Bush's war on his terms for his reasons. It is blood that cannot be expunged, expiated or \"parked\", as some crasser Labour campaign organisers say. The cabinet and MPs were complicit, but this was Blair's war and he is immeasurably damaged by it: now it symbolises a host of other discontents. But there is not much Blair can do about it. He can't apologise for a war he thought right. I am not among those who think he lied. All he can do is keep acknowledging the widespread anger. So at this point the question falls back on the Labour voter. What are you going to do about it? To make Blair suffer by chasing Labour from power would be an odd revenge - cutting off Blair's nose to spite everyone else's face. Imagine election night as Labour seat after Labour seat comes tumbling down to the Tories - Portillo night in reverse. (And it would be Tory wins since the Lib Dems can only expect five or six gains from Labour.) The individual voter can't fine- tune their vote to give Blair a satisfying slap in the face without risking Howard in Downing Street. As ever, revenge is disappointingly elusive. So forget retribution and look to the future: vote Blair, get Brown. Gordon Brown is all but certain to succeed and looks set to become this election's saviour. This architect of Labour's prudence has the aura of authenticity. His gruff ineptitude on radio and television and his old-fashioned stump speeches carry an air of virtue in these spin-phobic times. If he does not allow himself to be provoked into rows by some of the very provoking people around Blair in this campaign, he should emerge as the true victor. How soon will Brown take over? Tony Blair wants to fight and win the EU constitution referendum, leaving on a high. But it may become increasingly implausible that he would be the best person to persuade a profoundly sceptic Britain to vote yes. He has depleted his stock of \"trust me\" on the road to Baghdad and Brown, the euro-sceptic, might put a more convincing case. It is a reasonable bet that the prime minister will leave sooner than he says; it will be the big issue the day after the election. His friends should urge him to make the transi tion as smooth as he can, even if he grinds his teeth to the bone as he does it; his grace in going will affect how history sees him. For now, Blair needs to scotch all talk that he would sack Brown if he got a big enough majority: how can they both travel the country boasting of Brown's mighty economic prowess yet leave that open? And it encourages some to want a smaller majority. The Tories have dropped their Vote Blair, Get Brown poster campaign: it sounds more promise than threat now that Brown scores the highest popularity of all. Note how Howard yesterday used what focus groups have told him, mocking \"the smirking politics of Mr Blair\" who is \"secretly grinning about the prospect of his third victory\". Labour can never say this, but if reluctant voters prefer a Brown leadership they should consider that he needs every vote to inherit a healthy Labour majority. One more clarion call to Labour voters is overdue. Is it fear of the strong salience of immigration and asylum that has stopped every Labour minister storming at this most repellent, racist Tory campaign? An explosion of outrage should greet the way Howard stirs false fears. The \"It's not racist to control immigration\" poster reeks of racism when you see a crowd of black people waiting at the bus stop beside it. I asked them what they thought: disgust was unanimous. This is the lowest, nastiest most racist campaign I can remember and it's high time Labour got genuinely angry. If race, immigrants and Gypsies are the defining ground Howard has chosen, let the reluctant voters see Labour fight back ferociously. For this alone, any reluctant voter should want to see the Tories pounded to dust so no mainstream party ever plays the race card again. They need to be sent off in utter defeat to reform themselves into a civilised party - with no more great swings to the far right through crude use of race and fear. (Tory moderates think it necessary too.) So let no Labour voters think their vote too precious to cast for Blair. Revenge for a war that will never be repeated is a poor excuse. In our book Better or Worse? - Has Labour Delivered?, David Walker and I provide ample evidence of good done (alongside targets missed). The unconvinced should still vote for whichever party is most likely to beat the Tories in each seat - and then fight for reform of a first-past-the-post system that makes voting for least-worst parties a necessity. There is much to be proud of in voting Labour - but I have a free offer for the reluctant. On my desk is a basket of wooden nose-pegs marked \"Labour\". Any reluctant voter can have one of these to wear to the polls; apply here now. \u00b7 polly.toynbee@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
