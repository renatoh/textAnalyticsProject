This is to be Dr Maggie Atkinson of Gateshead. Last week the relevant select committee recommended that she should not get the job. They felt that she did not have the right experience to \"speak for children\". However, the children and schools minister, Ed \"Bitesyer\" Balls, overruled them. It is most unusual for committees to reject these nominations, so it looked as if the government was high-handedly overturning the judgment of MPs in order to bring in someone who would bow to the minister's will. MPs, whose judgment on anything has not been required by the government or anyone else for some years, claimed to be deeply offended. So they had what we in the trade call a \"different agenda\". In fact, everyone had a different agenda. The Tories, led by their shadow minister Michael Gove, saw a fine opportunity to attack Balls, who is a close associate of Gordon Brown, in the sense that Oddjob was a close associate of Auric Goldfinger. (\"I myself abhor violence in all its forms, Mr Gove. However, my close associate Mr Balls is less fastidious \u2026\") He is said to be a bully, and here was a classic example of his bullying. Meanwhile the chairman of the select committee, Barry Sheerman, has his own agenda. He is pondering whether to run for chairman of the parliamentary Labour party on a \"Gordon must go\" ticket. So he too needs to look bold and independent. This is why, in a radio interview yesterday, he described Balls as \"a bit of a bully who likes his own way\". So this row, like so many political fights, benefited everyone \u2013 except presumably Atkinson, who must feel like an ice hockey puck, being smashed in one direction and another across the rink. Balls depicted her as \"fearless\", \"independent\" and \"robust\". He made her sound like a she-bear guarding her cubs. Her nomination had been \"widely welcomed\". \"Who by?\" jeered the Tories. It was not a time for \"politics and partisanship,\" he added, to hoots of Tory merriment. As for being a bully, well he was not afraid to \"take the tough decisions\". This is politics-talk for \"I will do what the hell I please, whatever anyone else thinks\". You may recall that Tony Blair described the invasion of Iraq as a \"tough decision\". David Laws, the Lib Dem spokesman, said that there were those who suspected that Dr Atkinson was another in the \"succession of tame poodles doing the secretary of state's bidding\". Balls said she was no poodle. So, bear or poodle? As Harry Hill would say, \"there's only one way to decide this \u2013 fight!\" And fight they did. There was a curious moment when Lynda Waltho, a Labour loyalist on the committee, said sneerily that the secretary of state should \"rise above the macho posturing, albeit from the unlikely source of the gentleman opposite\", by which she meant Gove. The clear implication was that Gove, far from being macho, was an effete, panty-waisted milquetoast. I just mused for a moment what would have happened if a male MP had implied that a female MP was, for example, on the butch side. At the very least he would have had an unwelcome visit from Harriet Harman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
