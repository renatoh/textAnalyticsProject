The opposition held its own inquiry into one of the biggest issues in the UK\u2019s cultural sector: inequality, both in terms of who works in the arts and who gets to see it. The Acting Up report, published on Thursday, says the performing arts \u2013 whether stage, television or film \u2013 is \u201cincreasingly dominated by a narrow set of people from well-off backgrounds\u201d. It continues: \u201cIn an industry where perception and wealth are so important, recognising and understanding the role class plays is crucial. But at the moment there\u2019s a big C-shaped hole.\u201d Tracy Brabin, a former actor and MP who led the inquiry with fellow MP Gloria De Piero, said: \u201cThe systematic eradication of arts education in schools, sky-high drama school audition fees, chronic low pay and a lack of diversity behind the scenes are all contributing to a diversity crisis on our stages and screens.\u201d Brabin said \u201ccracking this crisis\u201d was political. \u201cWe can\u2019t just leave the industry to drive change. Things like poverty pay are the government\u2019s business and we need them to step into the void,\u201d she said. The report is based on two evidence sessions the party held in parliament and more than 100 written submissions. Among its conclusions and recommendations are: \u2022 A revamp of the English baccalaureate in schools, which the report says \u201chas led to a systematic marginalisation of arts subjects, particularly drama\u201d. \u2022 A call for drama schools to stop charging audition fees of up to \u00a3100. \u201cDrama schools are too expensive to apply to and instances of racism and snobbishness inside them are too common.\u201d \u2022 A widespread culture of low and no pay in the performing arts holds back \u201call but the most well-off talent\u201d and needs to be tackled by the government. \u2022 Broadcasters, film companies and theatres need to do more to bring on and develop working-class and diverse talent at all levels. \u2022 Diversity data is \u201ctoo patchy and often has a big hole where class data should be\u201d. Politicians need to spearhead a move \u201cto recognise socio-economic disadvantage in law\u201d to ensure a framework for better data collection. Among those giving evidence were Michelle Collins, a former EastEnders and Coronation Street actor, who said: \u201cI didn\u2019t go to drama school, I was turned down by every single drama school. In fact, I got a recall for Central but I think they had their quota of chirpy cockney working-class girls.\u201d Cush Jumbo, who appeared in the last series of US drama The Good Wife and stars in its spin-off The Good Fight, recalled nearly leaving Central after her first year \u201cbecause I felt so uncomfortable, so working class\u201d. \u201cI remember being told by the teacher who I was studying received pronunciation with that my accent was lazy, that south Londoners had lazy mouths and lazy accents,\u201d she said. She said she was one of only four actors of colour in her year. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I went to Central drama school that I actually looked in the mirror and realised I was of colour,\u201d she told the inquiry. The report quotes figures that suggest just 16% of actors come from a working-class background, whereas 51% have a privileged background. Another stat says 42% of British Bafta winners attended a fee-paying school. De Piero said it was \u201ctime we brought the curtain down on white middle-class dominance in the performing arts\u201d. She added: \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the Benedicts and Edwards on screen but the Hugos and Crispins behind the scenes too.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
