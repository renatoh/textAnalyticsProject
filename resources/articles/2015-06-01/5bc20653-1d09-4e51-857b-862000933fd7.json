The inclusion of Ukip in the original lineup of the Pride in London march set for 27 June had been controversial. Many in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community spoke out against the involvement of the party, which has been linked to a string of allegedly homophobic controversies. Following the creation of a petition calling for the party to be banned, Pride organisers said they had rejected Ukip\u2019s application to take part on safety grounds. Organisers said the decision was not politically motivated. A Pride spokesman said: \u201cOver the last few days we, both as individuals and the volunteer directors of Pride, have had to wrestle with a difficult issue \u2013 whether to include a group from Ukip in this year\u2019s Pride in London Parade. \u201cWe aim to unite our community, not divide it, and our intention is to serve the whole of our community with an inclusive event, so to exclude any group is not a decision we take lightly. \u201cFor this year we have reached the decision that Ukip\u2019s application to join the Pride in London parade on 27 June 2015 will be turned down. \u201cThis decision has been made after careful consultation in order to protect participants and ensure the event passes off safely and in the right spirit. It has not been made on a political basis. \u201cWe appreciate many in our community have strongly held views about Ukip, their policies and comments, but it is undeniable that there are LGBT members of Ukip, including their MEP for Scotland [David Coburn], and it is important to remember that Pride in London aims to be an inclusive event. \u201cHowever, of paramount concern to us is the experience of all participants at Pride, most especially the position we would be putting our volunteer stewards in.\u201d Ukip said said the decision marked \u201ca sad day for diversity and freedom\u201d and disputed organisers\u2019 version of events, saying the party had not had its application turned down but instead organisers had withdrawn their original invitation. Flo Lewis, the chair of LGBT in Ukip, said: \u201cThe board of Pride in London have not decided to reject our application. Instead they have decided to rescind the invitation under threats from and complaints by other members of the LGBT community. \u201cWe should, I think, be very sorry that this decision has been made, equally we are sorry that the organising committee and board has been put under the sort of pressure it has over the past few days. \u201cAll people, regardless of creed, colour or sexual orientation, can find a home in Ukip. It is a sad day for diversity and freedom when these people are prohibited from expressing themselves as part of the wider community.\u201d Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, reversed the party\u2019s position on same-sex marriage before the general election, saying he would not seek to overturn its legalisation. But the party has not been able to shake off allegations of homophobia. Alongside that decision came a commitment to give legal protection in the workplace to religious people who opposed same-sex marriage because of their beliefs, which would apply to cases such as the Northern Irish bakery found guilty of discrimination after declining an order for a cake bearing a pro-gay marriage slogan. Numerous Ukip members have also been caught up in homophobia scandals, including a councillor who blamed the winter floods of 2013-14 on the passage of same-sex marriage laws. More recently the party appeared to defend election candidate Geoffrey Caton who described gay people as \u201carse bandits\u201d, saying he had changed his views since posting them in 2013. In December last year, Ukip election candidate Kerry Smith resigned after describing gay people as \u201cfucking disgusting old poofters\u201d. In 2012, serial election candidate Winston McKenzie was reported to have said it would not be \u201chealthy\u201d for children to be adopted by gay couples."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
