Nineteen candidates for the presidential nomination were due to give five-minute speeches at the Democratic Party Hall of Fame dinner in Cedar Rapids \u2013 among them leading contenders Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris. Biden, who was attending his granddaughter\u2019s graduation, was not among them. He is due to visit Ottumwa, Iowa, on Tuesday \u2013 the same day Donald Trump will visit Council Bluffs and Des Moines. In the poll released by CNN and the Des Moines Register on Saturday night, Biden led the 23-strong field in the early voting state by eight clear points. But he only polled at 24%, down from his usual 30%-plus. Sanders was second with 16%, ahead of Warren with 15% and Buttigieg with 14%. Harris was the only other candidate above 5%, with half as much support as Buttigieg. The former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke and the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar were the only other candidates to get more than 1% support among likely caucus participants. Both attracted 2%. Higher-profile candidates attracting no support included New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand and New York City mayor Bill de Blasio. The poll also showed that voters who identify as liberal now favour Warren, and that the primary concern among respondents is who is best placed to beat Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s a strong showing for Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Ann Selzer, president of the eponymous company which conducted the poll, told the Register. \u201cI think that all of the publicity lately and all of the polls lately are so Biden-heavy that for her to have any metric that shows her on par [with him] \u2026 it says to me there are people who are paying attention [and] in a field this big, that\u2019s step one. First, you have to get people to pay attention.\u201d On Sunday, Sanders sought to deflect questions about his disagreements with Biden or the importance of any poll so far out from the caucuses, which will be held on 3 February next year. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get 50% of the vote in Iowa,\u201d Sanders told CNN\u2019s State of the Union, comparing the contest to 2016, when he went toe-to-toe with the narrow winner, Hillary Clinton. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody will. I think we have an excellent chance to win here, we\u2019re going to win in New Hampshire, and I think we have a very strong chance of being the candidate who will defeat the worst president in the modern history of this country, Donald Trump.\u201d One of the candidates with 2% in Iowa, Klobuchar, told CBS she could build support by being a midwestern senator \u201crunning on a track record of getting things done\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m clearly on the debate stage and expect to be there in the fall,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s going to give opportunity to voters in Iowa and all across the country to really narrow it down.\u201d Her fellow two-percenter, O\u2019Rourke, a charismatic candidate whose polling numbers have nonetheless gone into reverse, also played down the Iowa poll. \u201cIf I relied on polls in any race that I\u2019d run,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s This Week, \u201cI never would have been able to serve in the United States Congress. We never would have tried to take on Ted Cruz.\u201d That was a reference to the 2018 Texas Senate race which O\u2019Rourke lost to a Republican incumbent. Asked why he thought he was the man to beat Trump, the former congressman focused on his roots in a strongly Republican state and his stance against the president on the hot-button issue of immigration. Biden has so far focused on states where he polls strongly against Trump, including his native Pennsylvania and the post-industrial \u201crust belt\u201d, where the president beat Clinton on his way to victory in the electoral college despite a near-3-million-ballot defeat in the popular vote. In an interview with the Guardian published on Sunday, Bruce Haines, a former steel executive and Trump supporter from Northampton county, Pennsylvania, pointed to a main issue of contention in Democratic ranks nationwide. Should the party pick a progressive with bold policy ideas, such as Sanders or Warren, or should it opt for Biden or O\u2019Rourke, centrists with high name recognition in blue-collar or Republican-leaning states away from the liberal coasts? \u201cSo I think support [for Trump] is going to strengthen as we get closer to the election,\u201d Haines said. \u201cAnd as we sort out who he\u2019s going to run against \u2013 will it be a socialist, or will it be Biden?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
