Clarke also revealed the FA is conducting a review of its disciplinary processes that include looking at the rules around agents and transfers. Clarke, who along with the chief executive Martin Glenn mutually agreed to part company with Allardyce over an embarrassing newspaper sting, said he felt sympathy after they parted ways following a \u201cgrown up\u201d discussion. \u201cI sat down with him yesterday and said: \u2018Sam this is so foolish\u2019. He said: \u2018Yes, you\u2019re right\u2019. He created a lose-lose scenario where he lost the job of a lifetime and we lost an England manager who may have been pretty successful \u2013 he was doing a good job,\u201d he said. \u201cI did feel sorry for him. I don\u2019t get any pleasure from seeing a human being in pain. And Sam was hurting. He was the cause of his own demise but I don\u2019t get any pleasure from that.\u201d Clarke, only appointed to the FA role in August, indicated it would clamp down on the rules surrounding commercial arrangements for all staff. \u201cWe are going through a lessons learned process. The lessons learned will be very important. Things like: should any business development opportunity, even if it is in the opinion of the person involved non-conflicting, then should it be registered and reported to the FA?\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have a shirt or a watch or a shoe sponsor there is no conflict there but it is a commercial transaction leveraging off your role as a senior official at the FA. I think we\u2019ll move towards a lot more scrutiny of the commercial arrangements.\u201d Allardyce, speaking for the first time since he lost his job over his comments to undercover reporters, said \u201centrapment had won\u201d but Clarke said he did not have a problem with the way the story came out. \u201cMy view of these things is that if you think there is actually something going on, go after it. If you hear something and you want to run it down, then run it down,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause transparency and a strong media is vital to our society.\u201d He said he was unable to comment on Allardyce\u2019s payoff, citing confidentiality clauses, but said the terms were reached following a \u201csensible discussion\u201d. Clarke reiterated the view of Glenn that it was important for FA staff, including the England manager, to be held to high standards. \u201cAppearances do matter. The image of the FA is important. If we have to dispense discipline and justice, we have to be credible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe continually look at whether we\u2019re living up to our own standards. You can\u2019t tell people to do better if you have poor standards yourself. Organisational hypocrisy doesn\u2019t get you far.\u201d The disciplinary review, set in train by Glenn before Clarke\u2019s appointment, will involve discussions with the Premier League and the Football League as well as Fifa, Uefa, the government and the police over the best way to regulate issues surrounding transfers, money and agents. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about policing alleged transactions, it\u2019s about how we dispense justice around on and off the field disciplinary matters.\u201d He said the review would make proposals for various options that may lead to extra resources and extra powers. However, he said it had to be proportional. \u201cEveryone in football wants to deal with this issue but at the same time we don\u2019t want to be the Stasi.\u201d Clarke conceded that the issues around transfers were increasingly global in nature but said it was important to focus initially on what it could do in the short term in the England game. \u201cAll the problems of pan-geography legislation are insurmountable in the short to medium term. It\u2019s all long term. Getting the EU to do something or getting Fifa to do something is a long process because you have different statutory controls in different countries,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re trying to see what we in England can do better on our own without having to put together a global agreement. With the support of the government, the professional game, the national game, the police, what can we do that could make things better. It needs thought and it needs to be very clear about the problems we\u2019re trying to solve and what processes and powers we need to solve them.\u201d Questions have been asked over whether the FA should have appointed Allardycegiven the outstanding questions from the Quest review in 2006, which failed to clear three transfers in which he was involved while at Bolton. Allardyce strenuously denied any wrongdoing. \u201cThe one thing I don\u2019t try to do is to second guess decisions made in good faith when I wasn\u2019t here,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cIf I had been part of the decision and understood the facts, I would take accountability. I have never run away from accountability. The guys did their best.\u201d In a joint statement with the Premier League and the EFL, the FA also responded to the allegations in the Telegraph that alleged eight current and former managers had been said to take bungs. \u201cAny substantive allegations will be investigated with the full force of the rules at our disposal, which are wide-ranging and well-developed. In addition, should we find any evidence of criminality we would inform and seek the support of the appropriate statutory authorities,\u201d it said. On the appointment of a new England manager, Clarke said he would not rule out waiting until the end of the season for the right candidate. The England Under-21 coach, Gareth Southgate, will take charge of the next four matches. \u201cWe will look at what have we learned from the Sam hiring process and how do we apply that to the next hiring process. The most important thing is we\u2019ve got Gareth focused on the next four games. That buys us time to really give some thought to how we do it this time round,\u201d he said. \u201cMy view is that you need someone who really understands English football. That could be an English person or someone who has worked in England and managed at a senior level. But to parachute someone in who has never managed in this country would be a big ask.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
