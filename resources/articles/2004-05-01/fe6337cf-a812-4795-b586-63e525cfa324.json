It was unusual but completely in tune with Gloucestershire's understandably stoic approach, which involved grinding their opponents into the ground after their first-day profligacy. Spearman's innings lasted five hours and 223 balls, with 17 fours and a six. His dismissal, however, reverse-sweeping at the same bowler, did at least reassure us that the maverick side of his batting personality is alive and well. He also found an adhesive ally in Tim Hancock, who, despite some mishaps against the short ball, grafted for 3 hours. But the Northants attack, for all the perseverance of the unlucky Steffan Jones, must be contemplating a long hard summer, especially away from home where their spinners Jason Brown and Graeme Swann are likely to be nullified. The England selector Rod Marsh was in attendance, ostensibly to watch Alex Gidman, and his wait until 4.05pm was not in vain. The tall right-hander was soon unfurling his favoured leg-side clips as he and the wristy Shoaib Malik collected half-centuries en route to maximum batting points."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
