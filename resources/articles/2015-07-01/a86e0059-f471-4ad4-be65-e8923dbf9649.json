Milner was signed by City in August 2010 after an impressive season operating in central midfield for Aston Villa. However Roberto Mancini, who signed him, and the Italian\u2019s successor, Manuel Pellegrini, deployed Milner in a variety of positions across midfield and occasionally at right-back and centre-forward. Although Milner was well thought of and claimed every domestic trophy, he is conscious that time is ticking on his career. Asked if he moved to become a central figure for Liverpool, Milner said: \u201cYeah. I felt valued by the manager [at City] and the club and they saw me as a big part of the team on and off the field. But I was always going to be filling in and being that utility guy and doing a job for the team, and maybe this was the first time I\u2019ve made a decision to be more selfish and thought what was best for me. \u201cI was thinking what could have happened had I kicked on from that one season at Aston Villa where I played centrally and what could have happened if I\u2019d carried on like that. Who knows?\u201d Milner was unhappy at being left out of vital matches when at the Etihad Stadium. \u201cGetting to finals and things like that, the default was for me not to play,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the way it is and I want to play as much as I can. I could have easily stayed at City and been there another four to five years, being around the club, helping us win things. But over the next few years I wouldn\u2019t have played as much and my game time would have reduced. When I\u2019m older I want to look back and say that I became the best player I could. Liverpool\u2019s a great club to be an older member of the squad and help the younger guys along. There\u2019s a lot of football left in me and hopefully I\u2019ll be a part of a massively successful period.\u201d Milner is clearly frustrated by a view, offered by some supporters, that giving up on the City fight showed a lack of ambition. \u201cI would probably disagree with that,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people may look at it the other way and say I was not willing to sit on the bench for half a season, I wanted to play every single game and fight for a shirt and play that way, and I couldn\u2019t see that happening at Man City. \u201cYou can look at it any way you want, you can go away and write a story and twist it any way you want to put it. We know how it works and I can only tell you my thoughts and see it as a positive, and other people can look at it as a negative. \u201cObviously it was a difficult decision. It took me a long time to make it. I probably changed my mind on a weekly basis at times. The fans were amazing with me at City and that made it very tough for me as well. City is also a great club to play football at. But playing football are the key words in that sentence. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that I\u2019ll come here and play every game. I know it\u2019s down to me. But I feel here at Liverpool \u2013 what the manager has said to me and where he sees me playing, he thinks my best position is in the middle [of midfield] as well \u2013 so it\u2019s down to me to get in the team. \u201cI thought at times at City I won player of the month and then didn\u2019t play for three, four or five games after. I feel here if I play well, I\u2019ll keep the shirt. It\u2019s down to me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
