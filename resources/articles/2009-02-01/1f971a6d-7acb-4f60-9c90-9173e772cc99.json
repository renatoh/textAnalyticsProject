Ireland, who scored his 10th goal of the season against Copenhagen yesterday, has been one of the few players to be exempt from criticism after a consistently impressive campaign. Hughes, however, has frequently clashed with his Brazilian players about their lack of application, particularly in away matches. City have taken only seven points on their travels in the Premier League this season and they will go to Liverpool on Sunday having failed to win an away game since a 3-0 defeat of Sunderland in August. \"We've had a lot of discussions about this now,\" Ireland said. \"I think it's about comparing us to the other team and making sure, first of all, that we match their efforts and, after that, making sure we run harder and work harder than them. The thing we need to realise is that we're not going to win any game in the Premier League if we don't work hard. It hurts when the manager says we have not played with the right attitude. It's really hard to answer why, because there really is no excuse.\" Hughes dropped Elano from Thursday's 2-2 draw and although Robinho put on an improved performance, the manager must wish his Brazilian players could show some of Ireland's dedication. \"Every game I go into, I go into with the mentality of a winner,\" Ireland said. \"I want to win for myself, the team and especially for the gaffer because I think it's really important he stays. I really enjoy playing under him. A lot of the players are the same and want to win for him but there's the odd time when someone switches off and we concede goals. More often than not, everyone in the team really wants to win. I just think it's down to a lack of concentration for a split second. We need to start [the Liverpool game] from the off because we usually start sloppily and that puts us on the back foot.\" Ireland is contracted to City until June 2012 but his current salary of \u00a326,000 a week puts him among the lowest earners in the first team. The club has hinted it will reward him with an improved deal, although the player is not convinced. \"I don't think I'm going to get a new contract if I'm honest,\" he said. \"I'm still on a long-term contract and have enough time on this deal. I'm not really thinking about another negotiation as I'd love to stay here for a long time. I'd love to sit down and the club show me that they are as serious about me as I am about them. I'm concentrating on football but if that [a new contract] comes it would be great. If it doesn't, I'll keep going.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
