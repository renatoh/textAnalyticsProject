Birch, who has built a reputation as a steadying hand on the tiller at financially troubled clubs, will replace Michael Dunford at the Merseyside club. Dunford is expected to take another, as yet unspecified, role at Everton. Birch's brief will be to raise money for signings, no easy task at a club who are \u00a310m in debt and with long-term loans already securitised on Goodison Park. Meanwhile Everton's deputy chairman Bill Kenwright has laughed off reports in a Sunday newspaper that the club will sell Wayne Rooney to Manchester United. The 18-year-old England striker has also been linked with a summer switch to Chelsea. Kenwright told the club's website: \"It is always difficult to respond to rubbish. [The manager] David Moyes and myself have discussed a combined response and it is [that] the article is laughable.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
