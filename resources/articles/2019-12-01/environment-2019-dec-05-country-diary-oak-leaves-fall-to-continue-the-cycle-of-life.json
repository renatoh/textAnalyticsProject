Oak leaves are among the last to fall, they turn golden slowly, biding their time, toughing out the weather until a shudder runs through them and they let go, surrendering to a gravity they have resisted since the unfolding of spring. It\u2019s their destiny, they drop. In the morning, each leaf wears an edge of rime and the jewellery of almost-frozen rain. A fox, the same colour, nosed through them last night, sniffing their beery tannin, hungry for a trace of voles where worms slip deeper underground. This morning is one of frost and fog. Hawthorn, damson, ash, for the first time this year, have a gauntness; they are winter trees now. Flying wood pigeons disappear silently; distant traffic growl merges with the muted banter of blackbirds and robins; a peregrine on radar ghosts above. The oaks, free of foliage clutter, begin a kind of afterlife, darkly. Their leaves are tickets dumped at summer\u2019s destination, receipts for the life that came from light. Now they wait for the return journey, to a subterranean realm where darkness turns death back into life. The skin of these leaves is still too coarse; the alchemy of rot begins with ice crystals picking apart the cells and grazing by millipedes, letting microbes and fungi in, softening them up for burial by worms, taking them into the humus layer to sustain the metropolis of soil, feeding tree roots. Oak leaves bring acidic tannins that protect them from insect attack, pathogens and browsing animals above, down to earth. In the leaf litter, the tannins are a phytotoxin, inhibiting fungi involved in decomposition and suppressing other plants. However, as oak leaves decompose slowly, their pH rises to become more neutral, and levels of nitrogen in the soil rise. This litter, before it turns to mulch, is a beautiful drift of gold, ochre, browns and purples, a richness of colour that appears to glow, even in the fog. It is a fleeting and transitory new layer of land but kicking through the leaves reveals the sound, the feel and smell of them, drawing us into the breath of oak earth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
