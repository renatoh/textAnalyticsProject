In a sign of deep unease among senior Tories at some of the party\u2019s tactics, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean accused the prime minister of having \u201cshattered\u201d the pro-UK alliance in Scotland and stirring up English nationalism after the Scottish independence referendum last year. The intervention by the last Tory to serve as secretary of state for Scotland came on the eve of a speech by Sir John Major who will endorse warnings by David Cameron about the dangers of a post-election deal between Labour and the Scottish National party. The former prime minister, who campaigned alongside Forsyth against Scottish devolution in the 1997 election, will warn that a deal would leave Labour leader Ed Miliband open to a \u201cdaily dose of political blackmail\u201d from the SNP. But the former chancellor Alistair Darling, who saved the UK as leader of the Better Together campaign in the Scottish independence referendum last year, warned that the Tories were risking the destruction of the UK by talking up the SNP. Darling told the Guardian: \u201cThe Tories are entering into a dangerous, destructive embrace of the nationalists which is bad for Scotland, it is bad for the UK ... This will end up with the destruction of the UK.\u201d Forsyth raised similar concerns \u2013 though in more diplomatic language \u2013 as he spoke of the dangers for the Tories of appearing to will the SNP to success. The former MP for Stirling, who was close to Margaret Thatcher, told the Guardian: \u201cWe\u2019ve had the dilemma for Conservatives, which is they want to be the largest party at Westminster and therefore some see the fact that the nationalists are going to take seats in Scotland will be helpful. But that is a short-term and dangerous view which threatens the integrity of our country.\u201d The former Scotland secretary illustrated his concerns about the way in which some Tories are building up the SNP by highlighting George Osborne\u2019s praise for the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, after her appearance in the first of the UK-wide TV election debates. \u201cNicola Sturgeon does these debates and she\u2019s praised to the skies,\u201d Forsyth said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had George Osborne praising her saying what a marvellous performance. What she is asking for, which is fiscal autonomy, would mean that there was a gap of \u00a38bn in the budget.\u201d Forsyth claimed the Tories were partly responsible for the rise of the SNP after helping to prop up Alex Salmond\u2019s minority government from 2007 to 2011, a move that gave Tory voters \u201cpermission\u201d to support the SNP to keep out Labour. In a blow to the prime minister, who claims that Labour is planning a secret post-election alliance with the SNP, Forsyth also praised the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, for the brave way in which he challenged Sturgeon in last week\u2019s TV debate. Forsyth\u2019s intervention comes as other senior Tories and constitutional experts raise concerns about the way in which Cameron is seeking to shore up the Conservative vote in England by issuing dire warnings about the \u201cterrifying prospect\u201d of a Labour-SNP deal. Cameron warned on Monday that such a coalition would be a \u201cmatch made in hell\u201d. Critics say the tactics are divisive, will polarise Scotland against England and will end up undermining Scottish support for the UK. Fears are being voiced that the highly contentious claims that Labour wants to form an alliance with a party committed to the breakup of the UK are inflicting severe damage on the largest pro-union party in Scotland in a move that will just end up boosting the case for independence. Vernon Bogdanor, the prime minister\u2019s former tutor at Oxford, who is now professor of government at King\u2019s College London, told the Guardian it was dangerous to polarise Scotland against England. In remarks that raise doubts about some of the prime minister\u2019s central lines of attack on Miliband, Forsyth: \u2022 Lauded Miliband for the brave way in which he challenged Sturgeon in their television encounter last week. He said: \u201cEd Miliband was actually rather good when he did actually for the first time seem to make it absolutely clear that his priority was to unite the country and to have nothing to do with the separatists. I thought that was a brave thing for him to do.\u201d \u2022 Claimed that the Conservative party was in part to blame for the rise of the SNP after it helped to prop up Alex Salmond\u2019s minority government in the Scottish parliament between 2007 and 2011. He said: \u201cThe great irony of the SNP\u2019s position now [is that] the Tories gave support to a nationalist minority government saying we could do business with them. The result was that in constituencies in the north-east of Scotland and so on, lots of Tories felt they had permission to vote SNP to keep Labour out. So you got tactical voting and that got the SNP into the Tory heartlands.\u201d \u2022 Challenged the way in which Cameron played the English card in the immediate aftermath of the Scottish independence referendum by offering English MPs a greater say over English-only laws. This was toughened up to a \u201cveto\u201d in the Conservative election manifesto. Forsyth said: \u201cDavid Cameron, instead of going up to Scotland the next day [after the referendum] and saying \u2018look we\u2019ve got to look at this now from the point of view of the whole United Kingdom\u2019, started this English votes for English laws thing which was not really a unionist position and that shattered the unionist alliance against the breakup of the United Kingdom. \u201cI personally don\u2019t support English votes for English laws. It doesn\u2019t seem to me to be a very good policy to try and deal with the rise of Scottish nationalism by stirring up English nationalism. I think you have to, we need to find ways of binding the United Kingdom together, of binding that partnership together.\u201d The former Scotland secretary spoke out as his former Downing Street boss prepared to offer full-throated endorsement of Cameron\u2019s warnings about the \u201cfrightening prospect\u201d of a post-election deal between Labour and the SNP. Major will say: \u201cThis is a recipe for mayhem. At the very moment our country needs a strong and stable government, we risk a weak and unstable one \u2013 pushed to the left by its allies and open to a daily dose of political blackmail.\u201d The prime minister claimed Labour and the SNP were \u201creally on the same side\u201d and therefore posed a threat to the future of the UK. He said at a campaign event in Crewe: \u201cMake no mistake, if Labour and the SNP get into power, you are going to see an alliance between a party that wants to spend, borrow and tax more with a party that wants to spend, borrow and tax even more. The Tories illustrated these warnings by releasing a poster early in the campaign that featured a childlike Miliband in the breast pocket of a giant Alex Salmond. This has been replaced by a poster of Sturgeon as Miliband\u2019s puppet master. Miliband has ruled out forming a coalition with the SNP but has declined to dismiss a less formal arrangement for fear of appearing to disenfranchise Scottish voters. Opinion polls suggest the only viable government would involve some sort of deal between Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP, which could win all Scotland\u2019s 59 seats. Darling emphatically rejected the idea of a Labour-SNP alliance. He told the Guardian: \u201cThe idea that Labour and the nationalists would enter into some sort of alliance is for the birds. It just isn\u2019t going to happen. The reason for it is that the nationalists have no interest in maintaining a strong British government. Indeed their entire reason for their existence is to get out of the rest of Britain. This is all part of the Tory tactic of bigging up the SNP because they are failing to make progress on anything they\u2019ve got to say.\u201d The former chancellor added: \u201cDavid Cameron made a profound mistake on the morning after the referendum of letting the nationalists back in the front door by linking additional powers [to the Scottish parliament] with English votes [for English laws] and he is compounding it now. We have got just over two weeks to go. It is time they woke up and realised what they are doing before it is too late.\u201d Forsyth said questioning the legitimacy of SNP MPs by the Tories was unwise and ran counter to the assurances offered during the referendum about guaranteeing an inclusive UK. Forsyth\u2019s remarks have added resonance because he is an ardent Thatcherite and unionist who played a leading role in fighting Labour\u2019s plans for a Scottish parliament in the 1997 election campaign. Forsyth said he had limited sympathy for Labour, which was paying the price for adopting the language of nationalism in the 1980s by claiming that the Tories had no mandate to govern in Scotland. \u201cThe Labour party now find themselves surprised that they are being devoured by the nationalist tiger,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
