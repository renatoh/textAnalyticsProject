Two points from safety, Hull have to defeat United to have any chance of survival, and Smalling said: \u201cIt will be tough. They\u2019ve got a lot to play for but we\u2019ll want to finish the season on a high. We want to make sure that we go out with a win.\u201d Smalling, who led United against Arsenal in Sunday\u2019s 1-1 draw at Old Trafford, echoed his manager, Louis vaan Gaal, who admitted being concerned at how United allowed the Gunners back into the contest. Tyler Blackett\u2019s 82nd-minute own goal cancelled out Ander Herrera\u2019s first-half strike after United had dominated the visitors. \u201cIn these games you need to get that second goal and unfortunately we didn\u2019t, and we paid the price at the end,\u201d the defender said, before saying that United\u2019s likely fourth-place finish is not good enough for the club. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not [a season] where we\u2019re massively celebrating, it\u2019s a step. Next season we know that won\u2019t be good enough and our fans at the end today were terrific. \u201cHopefully, next season we\u2019ll be having a parade with something to really cheer about. I think as the season\u2019s gone on, we\u2019ve got better, but Chelsea\u2019s consistency from day one has won them the title. Sometimes they didn\u2019t play well and still won games, they saw off games like [against Arsenal], they would have probably won it 1-0. Next season, it\u2019s a case of starting on the front foot and keeping that consistency. \u201cI think for 60 or 70 minutes we were the better team, but then we really needed to see out the game. We were a bit too open and paid the price, albeit with another deflected goal, something that\u2019s gone against us recently.\u201d Although Radamel Falcao may not have his loan from Monaco made into a permanent move, Smalling believes he could still be a success at United. \u201cI think when the manager has given him a chance and he\u2019s trained well and he\u2019s stayed fit, you can see he is getting sharper and sharper and with a good pre-season he\u2019ll be firing again next season. He\u2019s had a couple of injuries on the way, and with every player that means you don\u2019t get the consistency of being able to train every week. It affects your flow, especially with strikers who need a run of goals to set them off. \u201cI think with his record, he\u2019s a marked man. He does get kicked a lot in every game and it\u2019s because of what he\u2019s done in the game. His training performances have been terrific and today he was running in behind as the manager wanted. On another day he could have scored a few more goals.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
