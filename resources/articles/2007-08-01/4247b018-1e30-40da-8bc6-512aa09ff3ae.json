London Stockard Channing returns to the London stage for the third time following Tim Robbins' The Exonerated at the Riverside Studios and Six Degrees Of Separation at the Royal Court. The actress best known for her appearances in TV's The West Wing and the film Grease plays a family matriarch in Clifford Odets's Awake And Sing!, a 1935 play telling the story of a three-generation Jewish family living in a Bronx apartment during the Depression. Bigger on character and socialist rhetoric than plot, it depicts their economic hardships, hopes and fears (prefiguring Arnold Wesker's trilogy of Jewish family life). It was an autobiographical first play by Odets, whose later struggle to adapt to the demands of Hollywood inspired the film Barton Fink. Michael Attenborough directs. Mark Cook \u00b7 Almeida Theatre, N1, Fri 31 to Oct 20 Twelfth Night Stratford-upon-Avon Gender and roles will not be assigned as nature might have intended in this new production directed by Neil Bartlett, who had a recent success in Brighton with an offbeat version of Genet's The Maids. The ultimate, cross-dressing mistaken identity farce, this most melancholy comedy would, of course, have originally been acted by boys pretending to be women disguised as boys. Confused? Well, Viola certainly is and, in this instance, she will be played by a male actor, Chris New, who was recently Horst alongside Alan Cumming in Bent. American actor John Lithgow is Malvolio and Siobhan Redmond should be a sparky Maria. Lyn Gardner \u00b7 Courtyard Theatre, Thu 30 to Oct 6 Traces Edinburgh Circus performance has moved on a long way in recent years, with the most interesting companies negotiating a path that is as far from the old-fashioned big top as it is from Cirque Du Soleil. One of them is The Seven Fingers, a young French-Canadian troupe who are so breathtaking you genuinely could watch them jump through hoops all day. The way the show is packaged makes it interesting, as it plays out its feats against the endlessly ticking clock and a wistful sense that we all only have a few years on earth before being blown away by the sands of time. But that doesn't mean it's heavy; this young company's skills are so superlative you almost feel they can fly. LG \u00b7 Assembly @ George Street, Sat 25 to Mon 27 Cider With Rosie Newcastle-under-Lyme \"I belonged to that generation which saw, by chance, the end of 1,000 years of life,\" wrote Laurie Lee, whose account of being brought up by his single mother and with eight siblings in the inter-war world is one of the great memoirs of rural life. Nick Darke's version should be as warm and satisfying as toast and honey as it recounts all the novel's great incidents, from the first day at school to Lee's encounter with local siren, Rosie, under the hay wagon one hot summer's day. A journey from innocence to manhood peopled with a host of warring and eccentric relatives, Theresa Heskins' production should recall a world long since vanished. LG \u00b7 New Vic, Fri 31 to Sep 22 Orpheus X Edinburgh This year's Edinburgh International Festival programme has placed a particular emphasis on the importance of mythology and the way that different versions of the same story pop up across centuries and across cultures. So it's fitting that the theatre programme should head towards its conclusion with the American Repertory Theatre's contemporary take on Orpheus, which casts the lyre-playing poet as a modern rock god. With music and text by Rinde Eckert, this imagines Orpheus shut up in his recording studio after being involved in a fatal car crash which killed Eurydice. The only way he can save her is by taking a journey to Hades and back. But will she want to return to the world above? LG \u00b7 Royal Lyceum Theatre, Sat 25 to Aug 29 The Burial At Thebes Nottingham \"Why do it again?\" was poet Seamus Heaney's response when Dublin's Abbey Theatre first approached him to write a new version of Sophocles' Antigone, the story about the Theban princess who defies her Uncle Creon and buries the body of her brother, Polyneices, declared a traitor to the city. Then George Bush started rattling his sabre and, as the Iraq war loomed, Nobel prize-winner Heaney knew it was game on. The result is the gravely beautiful and exquisitely simple The Burial At Thebes, which draws on the rhythm of Irish laments to retell an age old story with a contemporary twist. Lucy Pitman-Wallace's UK premiere was a huge success at the Playhouse in 2005 and now it is back for two weeks to be followed by a tour to London and Oxford. LG \u00b7 Nottingham Playhouse, Fri 31 to Sep 15 Optical Identity Edinburgh Musical furniture seems all the rage this festival. Aurora Nova has had a hit with The Table, a wooden instrument with exceptional acoustic properties, and now Scotland's Theatre Cryptic joins Singapore's T'ang Quartet to create music that is to be seen as much as heard. With sculptural sets by famed furniture designer Jason Ong, Optical Indentity is an experiment which combines interactive technologies and visuals with established chamber pieces and new music - including the European premiere of a new piece from Joby Talbot, who has worked with the Divine Comedy and the White Stripes. Director Cathie Boyd has been at the forefront in developments in music theatre over the last decade, so this should be a stimulating and challenging evening. LG \u00b7 Royal Lyceum Theatre, Fri 31 to Sep 1 All About My Mother London Something of a coup for Kevin Spacey's Old Vic in capturing the world premiere of a play based on a Pedro Almod\u00f3var movie. It's the first time that the colourful Spanish director has allowed his work to be performed in English in the theatre, and almost 20 years since any stage adaptation of his work. All About My Mother was his 1999 film, which won an Oscar as best foreign language film and has now been adapted by Samuel Adamson. After the sudden death of her son on his 17th birthday, Manuela (played by Lesley Manville, best known for her work with director Mike Leigh) goes in search of the father he never knew, now a transvestite. She encounters another tranny, a young pregnant nun who is looking for love, and Huma Rojo (Diana Rigg), the actress her son adored. Tom Cairns directs this quintessential Almod\u00f3var, an absorbing yarn with great parts for women.
