Research has shown that graduates end up applying to jobs because of the ease of accessing online forms, rather than because of their suitability for the role. Employers can spot who is genuinely interested in the job they are offering. \u00b7 Virtual reality. Completing an application online can feel as though it is \"unreal\". Remember, an actual recruiter will see your forms. Make sure you spend as much time preparing your answers for an online form as you would for a paper-based one. Think about what you are writing and the way you express yourself; don't just type in a response as though you are writing an email to a friend. \u00b7 Once you have logged on to the form, find out what information is required from you. What questions do they ask? Do they want you to attach a CV? \u00b7 Technicalities. Remember, this is the internet. Computer crashes and lost connections do happen. Be warned that some pages expire after a certain amount of time. For questions that require longer answers, always prepare and keep a copy of your responses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
