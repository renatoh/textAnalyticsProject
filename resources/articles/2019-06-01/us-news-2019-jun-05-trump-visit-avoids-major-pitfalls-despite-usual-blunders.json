It may be that the bar had been set vertiginously low, or that Trump, as a repeat visitor, has lost some of his capacity for shock and awe. Somehow, it seemed tame and normalised in comparison with his previous disastrous visit a year ago. Even the protests felt familiar, and like Trump\u2019s insults aimed at Sadiq Khan, heartfelt but formulaic. It may also have been that the day devoted to politics was squeezed between the Queen\u2019s pageantry and the solemnity of the D-day 75 anniversary commemorations, but Tuesday\u2019s joint May-Trump press event, by the cartwheeling madness of some of his previous performances, was relatively tame. Faced by the power vacuum that is contemporary Britain, Trump himself seemed deflated. True, Trump blundered by saying the NHS would be \u201con the table\u201d in any \u201cphenomenal\u201d trade deal \u2013 and it is extraordinary that even the current caretaker Downing Street operation was unable to warn him off such a rookie error after the US ambassador in London, Woody Johnson, made exactly the same mistake three days earlier. It is a phrase that is going to haunt Brexiters, however quickly Trump later tried to retract his claim in his Piers Morgan interview. More seriously the whole episode just confirmed that a bilateral trade deal was far off, hard to negotiate and would be no substitute for the UK\u2019s lost access to EU markets. Even Nigel Farage seemed alarmed after meeting Trump at the lack of substantive progress on a deal. But on the other high-level diplomatic issues, the two sides averted some of the worst pitfalls. Even in praising Brexit \u2013 described as necessary because Britain, \u201ca great place\u201d, wants its own identity - the president refrained from attacking the European Union. This self-restraint was only marred when he reached Ireland and told the Irish that a wall necessitated by Brexit would be \u201cvery, very good for Ireland\u201d. May also pre-empted a row over Nato by being the first to call for greater burden sharing on defence spending. By his standards, Trump was personally courteous towards her, describing May as a tremendous professional and a better negotiator than him. Last year in an interview he said contemptuously she did not listen to him on how to handle Brexit. May delivered a strong message on the need to avoid escalation in Iran, and in private the Trump team insisted his goal was not war or the removal of \u201cthe world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terror\u201d, but instead to pressurise the country\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, to open talks. Britain is one of the many mediators on offer. The issue of Huawei \u2013 so sensitive since it goes to the heart of the intelligence relationship on which everything rests \u2013 was also defused by the British making clear that any decision awaits the next prime minister. Trump also buried the row by saying: \u201cWe have an incredible intelligence relationship and we will be able to work out any differences.\u201d But that does not mean the dispute itself is anything but deferred. British and American attitudes to China are fundamentally at odds, and Britain is determined to push the argument that its telecommunications architecture is different to others. All the while, the British managed either through the Queen\u2019s remarks, a copy of the 1941 Atlantic Treaty or the sealed signed D-day proclamation, to smuggle in subtle references to the value of alliances, cooperation and the values of democracy. In any other context, the gifts and rhetoric might seem humdrum to the point of bland, but faced by a politician that has been described as \u201cconducting an unprecedented and multifaceted experiment in the application of brute force\u201d it seemed brave. But for the moment Trump\u2019s verdict on Britain\u2019s future relevance is on hold, awaiting its choice of new prime minister and the Brexit course the country finally takes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
