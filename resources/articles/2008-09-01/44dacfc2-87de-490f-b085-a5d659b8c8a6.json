Patel's serene first-innings 70 against Hampshire in the final match of the county season possessed such quality that another hour or so might have made a Nottinghamshire title inevitable. But his lax dismissal sparked a collapse in which their last seven wickets fell for 39. Hampshire duly took command on a flat surface to make 449-5, forcing Notts to make a suicidal attempt to chase 442 in 76 overs \u2014 and lose by 203 runs. Read, for all his disappointment, had only encouragement for Patel, who made an impressive England one-day debut this summer and who has an outside chance of being named in the Test squad today for a two-Test tour of India. \"I see Samit as a Test player of the future,'' Read said. \"In my mind, he is a batsman who can be used as a second spinner. In one-day cricket he is good enough to be used as your spinner as he has proved with England this summer. But if he played in a Test squad I would have him batting top 6/7 and he would do a very fine job as the second spinner. \"England have to pick the best two spinners in the country for the India Test series. But if they pick a third spinner who can bat in the top seven then that might be a way in for Samit. \"He has come on fantastically. He had an uncharacteristically slow start with the bat this season but he took himself off to Bangalore last winter and his bowling has come on leaps and bounds. He has been one of our best one-day bowlers, an asset in the four-day game on dryer wickets and his form in the second half of the season with the bat has been simply sublime.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
