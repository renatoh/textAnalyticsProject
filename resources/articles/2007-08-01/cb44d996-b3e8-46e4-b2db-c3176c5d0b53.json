But the six-year-old, who needs everything to go right for him, is not one to take a short price about and at 10-1 Rayhani represents each-way value. Gelded at the end of last season, Rayhani (3.25) has returned a much-improved performer and won a 12-furlong handicap at Newmarket in May impressively. Marcus Tregoning, his trainer, could have gone for a lesser target with the four-year-old this week and it is significant he has opted for this Group 2 contest. \"Rayhani has been working out of his skin,\" said Tregoning yesterday. \"He's a big, strong horse and a staying type and he just might surprise one or two people. I'll be surprised if he doesn't go well.\" Tregoning has been waiting for good ground to run Rayhani again and conditions today should be perfect. Geordieland, five-lengths second to Yeats here last year when having his first run since joining Jamie Osborne's stable from France, has yet to win a race for his current trainer. He again chased home Yeats in this season's Ascot Gold Cup, which makes him the pick on form. However, Geordieland's style of running - having to be produced as late as possible - may not be best suited to Goodwood and Jamie Spencer will have to get his timing just right. Spencer is also on board the favourite, Enticing, in the Audi Stakes. The filly, who edged out Wi Dud in the Molecomb Stakes here last year, needs to step up on a below-par run at Ayr. She had previously run a much better race when fifth to Miss Andretti at Royal Ascot, where several of today's rivals were behind her. They included Tax Free (2.50), but Dandy Nicholls' five-year-old had little chance from his low draw in the King's Stand Stakes. His defeat of Dandy Man and Desert Lord at Naas in June was smart form. The progressive Wannabe Posh (2.15), who stayed on to finish third in a Group Three at Cork last time, looks sure to appreciate the extra two furlongs of the Lillie Langtry Stakes. Ron Cox's tip of the day Proponent 4.00 Goodwood The Roger Charlton stable has now hit top form which augurs well for Proponent on his return to action. Rated a possible Derby horse at the start of the season, Proponent was found to be suffering from stomach ulcers after he ran badly in the Dante Stakes in May. Entered for the Group 2 Great Voltigeur Stakes at York later this month, he could prove to be well handicapped at present."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
