The huge bill relates to a change in the status of the BCCI, which is registered as a charitable trust, arising from its role in the Indian Premier League Twenty20 competition. The BCCI has been flexing its considerable muscle in recent days, first by slapping down an England proposal to the International Cricket Conference that would have removed India's veto over the use of the decision review system in away series, and then by refusing permission for several English counties to use the Global Cricket School in Pune. Meanwhile, Ottis Gibson, who was thought to be keen to succeed Ashley Giles as Warwickshire's director of cricket, has signed a new three-year contract to stay on as West Indies coach. The former Durham seamer and England bowling coach was one of three leading contenders for the Warwickshire job which instead went to the county's former all-rounder Dougie Brown. \"I enjoy being involved in West Indies cricket and it is something I'm very excited about considering what we have achieved \u2013 especially in the last year,\" said Gibson, referring mainly to the team's victory in the World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka. \"This confirms that we are making progress and I am happy to continue with the team for the next three years as we look to take West Indies cricket forward.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
