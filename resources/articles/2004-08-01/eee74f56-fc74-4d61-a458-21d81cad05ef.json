James remains Eriksson's first choice, as he has been since David Seaman's international retirement at the end of the 2002-03 season, but young rivals are closing in on the Manchester City 34-year-old. England's manager has great faith in 23-year-old Chris Kirkland but he remains stuck behind Jerzy Dudek at Liverpool which has cleared the way for Robinson, just one year older, to press his own international claim. Robinson is hoping that his summer move from Leeds to Tottenham can fire his England career after only one international start and four substitute appearances. Eriksson said: \"Robinson played well last Saturday [in keeping a clean sheet at Newcastle] and worked hard in the few sessions we had last week. \"He's young, I hope he stays fit and goes on playing like this. James is also playing well so probably I won't change for the next game. But you never know in life. It's up to the players to convince me they deserve to play.\" James should keep his place for next month's World Cup qualifiers in Austria and Poland but will not be the only senior player aware of competition for places. Both the Manchester City winger Shaun Wright-Phillips, who scored on his debut against Ukraine last week, and the Tottenham striker Jermain Defoe, who made another good impression as a substitute, should keep their places in the squad. Eriksson told theFA.com, the Football Association's website: \"Wright-Phillips scored a goal which made the headlines so I'm happy for him [and] Defoe is a brilliant talent. He's a natural goalscorer. Close to, as well as in, the box, he is very strong and quick.\" Eriksson also welcomed his new working partnership with Sir Trevor Brooking, the FA's director of technical development. He said: \"It's good to have football people around you. He has huge experience of English football as a player, director and manager and our relationship is absolutely top-class. He is a nice man.\" The Nigeria midfielder Blessing Kaku has agreed a three-year deal with Bolton to become manager Sam Allardyce's ninth signing of the new season. Kaku, 26, played for Ashdod in Israel last season but holds a Belgian passport so does not require a work permit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
