It was a fait accompli. By the end of the 10th race on Sunday, Scott had an unassailable lead. The last two days had been \u201ca luxury\u201d, he said \u2013 the very happiest of a four-year wait which began when he was overlooked for selection in the same event at London 2012. \u201cI was pretty disappointed not to get to compete in London,\u201d Scott said. \u201cBut what came off the back of that was a lot of desire and the drive to right the wrongs I had made, get here and put on a good show in Rio.\u201d Scott\u2019s victory means that Great Britain has now won the Finn at the last five Olympics, a run that started with Iain Percy in Sydney in 2000 and continued with Sir Ben Ainslie\u2019s back-to-back wins at Athens, Beijing and London, the last of them achieved at Scott\u2019s expense. Whatever else we may lack, we\u2019re not short of brooding, bearded, sailors to helm our dinghy yachts. The great Paul Elvstr\u00f8m, who competed at eight Olympics, described the Finn as the one class of Olympic sailing where there was a clear difference between the \u201cgood\u201d and the \u201cvery good\u201d, who \u201ccan always leave distance between himself and others\u201d. And Scott has proved he is very good indeed. Stephen Park, the manager of Britain\u2019s sailing team, said Scott, 29, had a \u201cpsychological hold\u201d on everyone else. \u201cThe others are all racing for second,\u201d he said. \u201cThey look at Giles and say: \u2018You know what, this guy is just faster than us.\u2019\u201d Park compared him to Lewis Hamilton. \u201cIn F1 terms, if you\u2019re in the Red Bull or the Ferrari, you\u2019ve got some good kit, but he\u2019s in the Mercedes, so you just have to hope he makes a mistake.\u201d On the first day of the competition, Scott did. He misjudged the tides and wound up 17th out of 23. \u201cSome people would say it was his first Olympics, so he had a touch of nerves,\u201d said Park. \u201cI\u2019m not actually sure it was that, but just a simple error.\u201d Either way, he thinks it fired Scott up, and he has since finished first in three races, second in two, and third in two more. Scott started sailing when he was six years old. His father John had spent a little time \u201cmucking about in boats\u201d when he was at university, but neither he nor his wife, Ros, had ever taken it seriously. They got their three boys into the sport while the family was living in Canada, just so they had something better to do than hang out at the local mall. Simon Cray, credited by Scott\u2019s father as \u201cthe first man to say: \u2018This guy can go places\u2019\u201d, coached Scott during his junior years from the age of 10 at Hollowell sailing club, Northampton. \u201cI had the privilege of working with Giles during his junior years,\u201d said Cray. \u201cWe knew he had a special talent then, and to see him now reaching gold at the Olympics is just absolutely wonderful.\u201d Asked if he knew the boy he had coached would climb to the top spot, he replied with a simple \u201cyes\u201d, adding: \u201cI knew he would. He was good, had good talent \u2013 but above that he had the right sort of mental attitude. I had people who were perhaps at that time slightly better in terms of technical skills, but put them in a race and they didn\u2019t perform. Giles, whatever race you put him in, he came out on top. He was a great talent to work with and I feel extremely privileged to have been part of that.\u201d When he was 18, Scott won the ISAF youth sailing world championships in the Laser, and by 2008 he was training alongside Ainslie in the run-up to the Beijing Games. They didn\u2019t know it then, but three years later they would became fierce rivals for Team GB\u2019s one spot in the Finn at London 2012. Ainslie, who was 35, has since admitted that he felt threatened by Scott. He was so much younger and so much stronger, at a time when Ainslie felt he was beginning to reach his own sell-by date. Scott, who had a young man\u2019s arrogance, was convinced that he was the better sailor. He won the World and the European Championships in 2011, but lost the two crucial Olympic trial races to Ainslie. \u201cGiles was the only person who was beating Ben in the last few months leading up to the Games,\u201d remembers Park. \u201cIf he had he been racing at the Games many people would say that he would have won the gold if Ben had not been there.\u201d Ainslie and Scott always insisted they were friends, but you wouldn\u2019t always have known it from the way they behaved out on the water. \u201cBen was always simmering and occasionally that boiled over,\u201d said Park. \u201cGiles is perfectly assertive and doesn\u2019t let anyone take advantage of him.\u201d Scott once said of his relationship with Ainslie that \u201cthere has been the odd shouting match in training. I know why he does it: to assert himself. And I do it to show that I won\u2019t back down.\u201d Park remembers that when Ainslie was picked ahead of him, Scott \u201cwas irritated and angry because he thought he was better than Ben at Games time.\u201d In the end Scott spent a lot of the London 2012 regatta on a drinking spree. Scott and Ainslie have now teamed up for the America\u2019s Cup. Ainslie, impressed by just how shrewd and tough Scott was, has made him a key part of the team. \u201cThey will be pretty intimidating for most other people,\u201d says Park. \u201cThey\u2019re a bit of a dream team. Ben has that outspoken drive and passion. Giles is the computer, still ticking, thinking: \u2018This is our next best move, this is our next best move.\u2019\u201d Park wants Scott to come back to compete at both the 2020 and 2024 Olympics. He believes he could well win three Olympic titles. Scott isn\u2019t so sure. \u201cI\u2019ll never create a dynasty like Ainslie did,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m far too old already. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have my own ambitions in sailing: I\u2019m going off to the America\u2019s Cup and I\u2019d love to be able to bring that back to the UK.\u201d He flies home on Sunday, and will be back to work with Ainslie in just a couple of weeks\u2019 time. But before that he is planning to enjoy a drink or two with his family and friends here in Rio. This time round he will be celebrating \u2013 not drowning his sorrows."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
