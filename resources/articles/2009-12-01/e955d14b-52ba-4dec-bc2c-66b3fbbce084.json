When asked about pressure, the great Australian cricket all-rounder Keith Miller, who flew combat missions over Germany during the second world war, replied that pressure was having a Messerschmitt on your tail. When asked about pressure, Gary Megson talks of the ordeal of unemployment, of fighting in Afghanistan, of being a small businessman about to go under. Nevertheless, if his Bolton Wanderers side fail to win either of their next two home games, against Manchester City tomorrow and West Ham United on Tuesday night, his uneasy tenure at the Reebok will be unlikely to last. As Megson points out, he has never had a honeymoon as manager of Bolton. His arrival in October 2007 was greeted by demonstrations against his appointment and his exit will most likely be met by cheers in this corner of Lancashire. To many observing two campaigns during which he manoeuvred a club of modest resources to safety, was forced to sell Nicolas Anelka and Kevin Nolan, and took the side to what all managers with his budget crave \u2013 mid-table obscurity \u2013 it will be the sound of supreme ingratitude. And when it was pointed out to Megson that victory over Manchester City 13 months ago had kick-started Bolton's season, he replied: \"We got a good result \u00a3220m ago. Manchester City are a different team now. I just do my best with the resources and circumstances that I have. Have I ever had big money? No. Have I ever dreamed about it? No.\" There are many reasons why Bolton's supporters have never taken to Megson. Critics cite the sometimes leaden style of play \u2013 although the pretty football played by Colin Todd's sides was met by two relegations while Sammy Lee's insistence on altering the direct style perfected by his predecessor, Sam Allardyce, was a disaster. Megson is resolutely unglamorous, an old-school manager whose mentor was Howard Wilkinson at Sheffield Wednesday and whose training regime at West Bromwich Albion had its fair share of Sergeant Wilko's long cross-country runs. But the way in which he transformed West Brom from a club staggering towards the third tier of English football to a member of the Premier League suggests there was merit in his methods. While money has been limited and Megson has been forced to slash the wage bill he inherited, his record in the transfer market has been mixed. No fewer than five of his signings, including Johan Elmander, who cost \u00a38.2m from Toulouse and who last contributed to a Bolton victory in November 2008, were on the bench at Wolverhampton last Saturday. In the wake of that defeat, which as a former West Brom manager would have stung that little bit more, Megson was deeply critical of his players. \"There are three or four who are not doing what I know they can do,\" he said. The Wolves opener, scored by Jody Craddock, may have been palpably offside but Megson thought the free-kick that spawned it should have been dealt with professionally. \"I had a bit of a go at them at half-time and the person I was having a go at didn't accept it so we ran it on the DVD and it is as obvious as the nose on your face,\" he said. \"It wasn't down to quality or technique, it was purely down to the fact that they didn't want to put their foot behind it because they might get a knock.\" Some players believe that Megson has been having a go at them too often. One squad member, speaking anonymously, said that rather than be continually bawled out, they ought to be offered an arm round the shoulder. It might help to relax them. Away from the dressing room and the training ground, however, the same player said he found a more warm and supportive Megson: \"He always asks how the family are.\" When he was greeted by a demonstration before his first game, a Uefa Cup encounter with Braga, Megson walked over to the protesters and talked them round to the extent that they ended up cheering him. But despite everything he achieved, the jeering returned, never to go away. The Messerschmitt on his tail."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
