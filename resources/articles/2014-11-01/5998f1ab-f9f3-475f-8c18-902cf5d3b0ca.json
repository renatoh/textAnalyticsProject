The 20-times champions are on a third formation in 12 matches. Having spent all summer working on a three-centre-back system this was ditched after the opening four games. The results were loss-draw-loss-draw. Next came the more traditional 4-4-2 for another four outings. The results ran win-loss-win-win. Then, after Van Gaal decided he was unhappy with that approach, Radamel Falcao was dropped and United drew 2-2 at West Bromwich Albion on 20 October. Draw-loss were the following two results before this unconvincing victory over Crystal Palace in the fourth edition of Van Gaal\u2019s single-striker shape. Football is supposed to be a simple game. Pass and move. Move forward. Repeat three or four times. Now try to score. United\u2019s players must surely be confused. Van Gaal admitted that to constantly change the approach was not ideal. \u201cIt\u2019s too much, I think, I agree,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m looking for the balance and when you see the last four matches we have had more balance because we haven\u2019t conceded many goals. Nevertheless, we don\u2019t score so much. With the other system we scored a lot of goals.\u201d Van Gaal continues to sound unconvinced of what the best method is. Yet he said: \u201cWhen I answer that I have a clear vision then you have to know that I\u2019m [considered] arrogant but when you have seen what I have done in my career you have to know that I have a vision and that I\u2019m very confident in it. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is arrogant, it is self-confidence, although not only confidence in myself but in my players, in the club, in the structure and organisation, in the staff, in my press officer.\u201d As long as Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal continue to stutter, there is hope in the quest for a Champions League berth. United are only two points from West Ham United and Swansea in fourth and fifth respectively. \u201cWe have to ensure we maintain that we are in a position that we can be in the first four positions,\u201d said Van Gaal. \u201cOf course, we need to raise our level. It\u2019s a matter of time but it\u2019s also a matter of getting over a lot of injuries. When you have nine injuries and also a suspended player then that is always more difficult because I cannot select a lot of players. I can only line up 11 players because I don\u2019t have the players in the positions that I want to play.\u201d The 63-year-old\u2019s stated requirement of three years to make United a force again is not daunting. \u201cNo, it\u2019s a big challenge but that I knew in advance,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise I could have chosen another club.\u201d The muddled messages need to be discarded soon, though. Juan Mata\u2019s 67th-minute strike secured three points yet it papers over two more confused episodes. Near the close Van Gaal swapped Daley Blind with Michael Carrick, so the latter joined Paddy McNair as a second right-footer in central defence. This came despite the Dutchman\u2019s repeated mantra about always fielding a left-right combination at centre-back, so what the thinking was remains unclear. There was also the curious case of his captain, Wayne Rooney, and Marouane Fellaini not carrying out instructions. \u201cI said at half-time to Rooney and Fellaini that you have to play higher [up the field] in the supporting of Van Persie,\u201d said the manager. \u201cThat was not our gameplan \u2013 they were doing that and I had to correct them at half-time. Then they were playing higher [after the break].\u201d To allow a whole 45 minutes to pass with two players disrupting strategy before it is corrected seems slightly staggering. These are the kind of details that can prove costly and Palace should kick themselves. As Neil Warnock said: \u201cThat was my best chance of beating United at Old Trafford.\u201d His team are above the relegation zone only on goal difference but the manager is optimistic. \u201cI\u2019m quite pleased, really, because there are eight or nine teams in it and it is very close. We are all going to be scrapping and take our chances and get your points when you can.\u201d Man of the match Luke Shaw (Manchester United)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
