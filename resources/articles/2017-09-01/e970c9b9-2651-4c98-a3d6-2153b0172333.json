The BBC1 festive special of French and Saunders will feature the double act\u2019s most popular sketches from the past three decades, plus rarely seen footage and new material. The pair will once again be parodying popular films and TV \u2013 including 2017 hits such as The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. The sketch show last aired on TV in 2007, but the comedians have since worked together on Comic Relief and Radio 2 specials. Saunders said: \u201cWe have almost deliberately stayed alive this long just to force the British Broadcorping Castration to put us on television one last time.\u201d French told the Daily Mirror: \u201cThere\u2019s some Handmaid\u2019s Tale in there. We had fun with some of the costumes.\u201d She said the pair would also parody drunken reality TV show contestants during their Christmas special, adding: \u201cI am shocked by how they behave.\u201d The show\u2019s executive producer, Jon Plowman, said: \u201cTo be honest, I wouldn\u2019t have a career without them \u2013 so it\u2019s terrific that they\u2019re back together for this show of old, gold and new stuff. \u201cThey are two of the greats and it\u2019s good that they\u2019ve finally found each other\u2019s phone numbers for the first time in a while.\u201d The BBC it would reveal more details at a later date."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
