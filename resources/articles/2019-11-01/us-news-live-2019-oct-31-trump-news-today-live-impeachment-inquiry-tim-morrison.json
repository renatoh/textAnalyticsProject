NSC official Tim Morrison testified before congress, affirming that Trump sought a quid pro quo, while insisting that there was nothing illegal about it. Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers said they were vindicated by his testimony. A majority of Americans \u2014 61% \u2014 say Trump violates democratic institutions and forms. Representative Katie Hill condemned the \u201cdouble standard\u201d that had forced her to resign while men who have been accused of sexual misconduct (including Trump) remain in power. Trump changed his primary residence to Florida Donald Trump has registered as a resident of Florida, the New York Times reports. In late September, Mr. Trump changed his primary residence from Manhattan to Palm Beach, Fla., according to documents filed with the Palm Beach County Circuit Court. Melania Trump, the first lady, also changed her residence to Palm Beach in an identical document. Each of the Trumps filed a \u201cdeclaration of domicile\u201d saying that the Mar-a-Lago Club, Mr. Trump\u2019s resort in Palm Beach, will be their permanent residence. \u201cIf I maintain another place or places of abode in some other state or states, I hereby declare that my above-described residence and abode in the State of Florida constitutes my predominant and principal home, and I intend to continue it permanently as such,\u201d reads the document that Mr. Trump filed. It\u2019s unclear why the Trumps made this change. It could be for tax purposes, or because the president\u2019s relationship with his hometown of New York has been deeply strained. 2020 Candidates divided on key issue: Candy corn The 2020 Democratic presidential challengers agree on quite a lot. Broadly, they all want to improve Americans\u2019 access to healthcare, develop policies to combat climate change and strengthen gun control laws. But are they pro- or anti-candy corn, the most controversial of Halloween treats? According to a New York Times poll, the candidates \u2013 much like the Guardian\u2019s West Coast bureau \u2013 are deeply divided. Amongst the candy corn haters are Kamala Harris, Andrew Yang and Michael Bennet. (Also, me). I\u2019m also counting Beto O\u2019Rourke, who said the worse Halloween candy is \u201canything without chocolate\u201d. Everyone knows that candy corn is made of sugar and existential dread. Amongst the candy corn lovers \u2014 John Delaney. Republican candidates Joe Walsh and Tom Steyer are also reportedly candy corn lovers. Front runners Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden stayed out of the fray, with Biden\u2019s campaign refusing to even name a worst candy. Bernie Sanders didn\u2019t respond to the Times. Democrats conducting the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump are emphasizing that NSC official Tim Morrison\u2019s testimony today confirmed that Trump sought a quid pro quo from the Ukranian president. Republican defenders of Trump are focusing instead on Morrison\u2019s view that there was nothing illegal about the quid pro quo. As The Guardian\u2019s Tom McCarthy reported: Morrison, a former senior congressional aide, seemed to seek to exculpate Trump by suggesting the quid pro quo was all Sondland\u2019s idea. \u201cI hoped that Ambassador Sondland\u2019s strategy was exclusively his own and would not be considered by leaders in the administration and Congress, who understood the strategic importance of Ukraine to our national security,\u201d Morrison said. A lawyer for Sondland did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lawyers for Sondland have said that he never mentioned the Bidens to the Ukrainians and suggested he was unaware of the Burisma-Biden tie. Trump is rewarding senators who\u2019re showing him support as he faces impeachment \u2014 with fundraising money. The president\u2019s reelection campaign sent an appeal urging donors to contribute to three senators who support an anti-impeachment resolution. According to a Politico report: Trump is tapping his vast fundraising network for a handful of loyal senators facing tough reelection bids in 2020. Each of them has signed onto a Republican-backed resolution condemning the inquiry as \u201cunprecedented and undemocratic.\u201d Conspicuously absent from the group is Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a politically vulnerable Republican who\u2019s refused to support the resolution and avoided taking a stance on impeachment. With his new push, Trump is exerting leverage over a group he badly needs in his corner with an impeachment trial likely coming soon to the Senate \u2014 but that also needs him. Republican senators on the ballot next year are lagging in fundraising, stoking uncertainty about the GOP\u2019s hold on the chamber, and could use the fundraising might of the president. Trump\u2019s political operation has raked in over $300 million this year. On Wednesday, the Trump reelection campaign sent a fundraising appeal to its massive email list urging donors to provide a contribution that would be divided between the president and Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis. Each of the senators are supporting the anti-impeachment resolution despite being endangered in 2020. Trump nominated Stephen Beigun, the US special envoy to North Korea, to the second-in-command position at the State Department. Beigun would take over from John Sullivan at the State Department, who has been nominated to serve as the next ambassador to Russia. The nomination comes amidst speculation over the future of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and turmoil at the State Department, which is entangled in the impeachment case against Trump. The Trump administration is considering adding more countries to the travel ban list, according to CNN, which cites unnamed officials. An inter-agency discussion about imposing travel restrictions on countries that are not compliant with electronic documents and information sharing -- a key focus of the administration -- is underway, according to a senior administration official. Fewer than five countries are under consideration, the official said. The goal, the official said, is to \u201cbring governments into compliance by using the power of access to the United States.\u201d The travel restrictions would be tailored to the countries, if they\u2019re added, and not impose a ban on them altogether, the official noted. The Guardian has not independently verified this reporting. An AP-NORC poll found that 61% of Americans think Donald Trump doesn\u2019t respect democratic institutions and norms. This includes 26% of Republicans. But the majority of Republicans \u2014 85% \u2014 approve of Trump\u2019s performance as president. Only 7% of Democrats agree. His approval overall stands at about 42%, according to the poll of 1,075 adults conducted Oct. 24-28. A district court judge will hear oral arguments on December 10 on whether or not Charles Kupperman, the former deputy national security adviser who defied a congressional subpoena and did not turn up at this scheduled deposition this week, will be forced to testify. Kupperman, who served as deputy national security adviser until last month, was listening in the infamous July phone call between Donald Trump and the Ukrainian president. The White House blocked him from testifying in the impeachment inquiry, claiming executive privilege. Another judge is ruling on whether former White House counsel Don McGahn must appear before Congress. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The House passed its impeachment resolution, clearing the way for public hearings and the release of transcripts from closed-door depositions. However, senior House Democrats did not provide a concrete timeline on when they would take those steps. House Republicans pointed to the nearly party-line vote on the resolution \u2014 all but two Democrats supported it, while every Republican opposed it \u2014 as evidence that the investigation is allegedly too partisan. Tim Morrison, Trump\u2019s top official on Russia, testified in the impeachment inquiry. The national security council official, who intends to soon leave the administration, affirmed Bill Taylor\u2019s account of a quid pro quo while claiming that he saw nothing illegal about Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. A federal judge appeared skeptical of the White House\u2019s argument that executive privilege exempted former administration officials from having to comply with congressional subpoenas in a case that could have major implications for the impeachment inquiry. Representative Katie Hill delivered her final floor speech, in which she apologized to her supporters and condemned the \u201cdouble standard\u201d that had forced her to resign while men who have been accused of sexual misconduct (including Trump) remain in positions of power. (Hill announced her resignation Sunday following the publication of nude photos of her and allegations that she had a relationship with one of her staffers.) Maanvi will have plenty more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. House Republicans appeared pleased with what Tim Morrison told impeachment investigators in his closed-door deposition, saying they look forward to the transcript of the interview being made public. According to Morrison\u2019s opening statement, the national security council official affirmed Bill Taylor\u2019s account of a quid pro quo but said he did not think there was anything illegal about Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. The president\u2019s allies celebrated Morrison\u2019s testimony as a victory for Trump, an assessment that the Democratic chairman of the House foreign affairs committee called \u201cabsurd.\u201d Tim Morrison has concluded his testimony in the impeachment inquiry after spending about eight hours talking to House investigators. According to his opening statement, the national security council official affirmed Bill Taylor\u2019s account of a quid pro quo while insisting he did not see anything illegal about Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. Morrison, who is soon leaving his NSC post, claimed he flagged the call for White House lawyers simply because he was worried about a \u201cpolarized\u201d political reaction to Trump\u2019s comments. A federal judge in Washington appeared skeptical today of arguments from the White House that executive privilege exempts former Trump administration officials from having to comply with congressional subpoenas. \u201cWe don\u2019t live in a world where your status as a former executive branch official somehow shields you or prevents you from giving information,\u201d judge Ketanji Brown Jackson said. The specific case Jackson is ruling on concerns whether Trump\u2019s former White House counsel, Don McGahn, must appear before House members for an interview. But the case could have sweeping implications on the impeachment inquiry, given that the White House has used similar arguments to block administration officials from speaking to House investigators. Earlier today we flagged reporting indicating that Tim Morrison, the national security council official testifying currently before the impeachment committees, would back up ambassador Bill Taylor\u2019s account of ambassador Gordon Sondland trying to strike a deal with Ukraine exchanging military aid for an announcement of investigations into Joe Biden and 2016 election tampering. Morrison did explicitly corroborate Taylor\u2019s account, according to Morrison\u2019s opening statement, posted online by CBS News: \u201cI can confirm that the substance of his statement, as it relates to conversations he and I had, is accurate,\u201d Morrison testified. But Morrison does not emerge as a particularly threatening witness for Trump; instead, his testimony threads multiple needles that seem designed to defend Trump in the Ukrainian affair. Morrison suggests that military aid to Ukraine was withheld owing in part to Trump\u2019s concern about corruption in Ukraine and about Europe not contributing enough. And Morrison suggests that the possibility of a quid pro quo involving military aid with Ukraine was diminished by his perception that Ukraine did not know military aid had been suspended until late August. Morrison\u2019s perception in this regard does not seem accurate. The New York Times has reported that the Ukrainians were aware of the suspension of aid in early August. In any case, Sondland was explicitly dangling aid to try to extract investigations in early September, in a bilateral meeting in Warsaw, according to Morrison\u2019s own testimony. Then Morrison floats quite a contention to exculpate the president \u2013 that maybe this was all Sondland\u2019s idea? The official said: \u201cI hoped that Ambassador Sondland\u2019s strategy was exclusively his own and would not be considered by leaders in the Administration and Congress, who understood the strategic importance of Ukraine to our national security.\u201d Sondland has said through a lawyer that he never mentioned \u201cBiden\u201d in conversations with Ukrainian officials, but instead spoke of Burisma, the gas company that formerly employed Hunter Biden. He has not responded to the notion that the quid pro quo strategy was \u201cexclusively his own.\u201d Morrison also testified that public summaries of a 25 July call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, which Morrison listened in on, were accurate. He says he went to NSC lawyers after the call, but he says he was not concerned that what Trump said was illegal: instead, Morrison says, he was worried about a \u201cpolarized\u201d political reaction, possible confusion in Congress and \u201chow it would affect the Ukrainian perceptions of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship\u201d. (Morrison was worried that reporting about a call that Ukrainians were on would affect their perceptions of the US-Ukraine relationship? Weren\u2019t those perceptions rather shaped by... being on the call?) Anyway, Morrison concludes, \u201cI want to be clear, I was not concerned that anything illegal was discussed.\u201d A publicity stunt by the National Republican Congressional Committee went terribly wrong when Capitol Police mistook boxes from the group as suspicious packages. House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm sent \u201cmoving boxes\u201d to vulnerable Democrats who voted for the impeachment resolution, creating some very understandable confusion and brief alarm on Capitol Hill. Luckily, the situation appears to have been quickly cleared up. While speaking to conservative British commentator Nigel Farage earlier today, Trump offered some disparaging comments about three of the frontrunners in the Democratic presidential primary. Trump dismissed the notion that he would pressure Ukraine to announce an investigation into Joe Biden \u2014 even though the evidence is mounting that he did \u2014 because he claimed he does not view the former vice president as a threat. Trump said: \u201cAlso, would I use Ukraine to beat sleepy Joe Biden? Sleepy Joe, I call him one percent Joe too. One percent, the guy never came out of these things with one percent and he\u2019s heading down rapidly now. I mean, I don\u2019t view him as a very difficult, difficult guy to beat.\u201d Asked for his prediction on who would win the Democratic nomination, Trump said: \u201cIt would look like Elizabeth Warren is picking up steam. She\u2019s picking up a little steam. I thought she was gonzo. ... So, it could be her, it could be Bernie Sanders, I guess. Maybe, I dunno. Bernie looks like he\u2019s shot, but it could be one of them.\u201d Federal prosecutors in New York are reportedly hesitant about the possibility of charging Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, for violating foreign lobbying laws. CNN reports: New York federal prosecutors examining Rudy Giuliani\u2019s Ukranian business dealings are mindful of both the approaching 2020 presidential election and of the difficulty of prosecuting foreign lobbying violations as they move forward in their investigation, according to people familiar with the matter. These people say charges against President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer aren\u2019t certain or imminent, but that Giuliani has come into prosecutors\u2019 crosshairs as a central focus during the months-long inquiry. In recent days, Giuliani has been in advanced discussions to hire Daniel L. Stein, a white-collar criminal defense attorney who is a veteran of the Manhattan US Attorney\u2019s office, to represent him in the investigation, sources say. Giuliani is also on the cover of this week\u2019s Time magazine. Speaking to reporters about his relationship with Trump, the former New York mayor expressed confidence that the president would stand by him. Giuliani said: \u201cHe\u2019s 100% in my corner and loyal to me as I am to him.\u201d Joe Biden has issued a statement on the House\u2019s passage of the impeachment resolution, expressing support for lawmakers performing their \u201cconstitutional duty.\u201d The statement accuses Trump of having \u201cweaponized the institutions of our government for political purposes, subverting our national security for his own political gain.\u201d Biden\u2019s statement continues: \u201cDonald Trump is testing the institutions of our democracy every day. But they are holding. Today, the House did its constitutional duty to proceed with a solemn investigation of unprecedented wrongdoing. \u201cMembers of Congress take an oath of loyalty to the Constitution when they are sworn in, not an oath to their party or to the president. Congress must do its duty to ensure that Donald Trump\u2019s assault on the Constitution does not seep beyond his presidency, with a lasting and devastating impact on our democracy.\u201d Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the national security council official who told impeachment investigators about his concerns after hearing Trump\u2019s Ukraine call, is reportedly willing to testify publicly. ABC News reports: Vindman, the first current White House official to cooperate with House impeachment investigators and appear on Capitol Hill for a closed-door deposition, is willing to testify publicly in the next phase of the inquiry, according to a source familiar with his thinking. ... Vindman, the first witness to appear on Capitol Hill with firsthand knowledge of the call, has not yet been formally contacted by House impeachment investigators about testifying in public, the source said. Bill Taylor has reportedly also expressed openness to testifying publicly. With today\u2019s passage of the impeachment resolution clearing the way toward public hearings, Americans may soon get to hear directly from Trump administration officials about the alleged quid pro quo the president has repeatedly denied. Speaking to conservative British commentator Nigel Farage, Trump slammed the vote approving the impeachment resolution as a \u201cdesperate\u201d move by House Democrats. In her final floor speech as a congresswoman, Katie Hill accused Trump of abusing his power \u2014 including his power over women. The freshman representative, who is resigning following the publication of nude photos of her and allegations that she had a relationship with one of her staffers, vowed that women would not be scared into silence. Hill said: \u201cWe will not stand down. We will not be broken. We will not be silenced. We will rise, and we will make tomorrow better than today.\u201d In her final floor speech as a congresswoman, Katie Hill said that the publication of nude photos of her had made her go to \u201cthe darkest places that a mind can go.\u201d The California Democrat lambasted the \u201cdirtiest gutter politics that I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d which had forced her to step down. Hill has acknowledged she had a relationship with a campaign staffer, but she condemned the \u201cdouble standard\u201d that had pressured her to leave Congress even as \u201cwe have men who have been credibly accused of intentional acts of sexual violence and remain in boardrooms, on the Supreme Court, in this very body, and worst of all, in the Oval Office.\u201d The freshman representative detailed the dozens of sexual assault allegations against Trump and expressed pride that her final vote as a congresswoman was in support of the impeachment inquiry. Hill concluded: \u201cThank you, and I will yield the balance of my time \u2014 for now but not forever.\u201d Representative Katie Hill is now delivering her final floor speech as a congresswoman. The California Democrat announced her resignation on Sunday following the publication of nude photos of her and allegations that she engaged in a relationship with one of her staffers. The freshman congresswoman said she was still grappling with her decision to leave sooner than expected. \u201cI thought I could make a difference here,\u201d Hill said. The California Democrat repeatedly apologized to her supporters, her volunteers and her colleagues. \u201cI am so, so sorry,\u201d Hill said. \u201cAnd to every little girl who looked up to me, I hope that one day you can forgive me.\u201d Trump has just wrapped up an interview with Nigel Farage, a conservative radio host and vocal supporter of Brexit. In it, the US president warned that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would be \u201cso bad\u201d for the UK and said the country has \u201ctremendous potential.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments come just two days after MPs voted to hold a general election on Dec. 12, allowing the British public to once again weigh in on the UK\u2019s separation from the EU. The blog is going to briefly interrupt impeachment coverage to share the story of how Rudy Giuliani locked himself out of his iPhone shortly after being named Trump\u2019s cybersecurity adviser. NBC News reports: Less than a month after he was named President Donald Trump\u2019s cybersecurity adviser in 2017, Rudy Giuliani walked into an Apple store in downtown San Francisco. He wasn\u2019t looking for a new gadget. Giuliani was looking for help. He was locked out of his iPhone because he had forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong one at least 10 times, according to two people familiar with the matter and a photo of an internal Apple store memo obtained by NBC News. \u2018Very sloppy,\u2019 said one of the people, a former Apple store employee who was there on the day that Giuliani stopped by in February 2017. \u2018Trump had just named him as an informal adviser on cybersecurity and here, he couldn\u2019t even master the fundamentals of securing your own device.\u2019 This report follows another from NBC News last week that Giuliani repeatedly butt-dialed a reporter in recent weeks and was overheard trashing Joe Biden and discussing his need for cash. In their press conference after the passage of the impeachment resolution, senior House Democrats provided little clarity on when they might release transcripts from their closed-door depositions or move to public hearings in the investigation. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The House passed its impeachment resolution outlining next steps in the inquiry as Democratic leaders advance toward public hearings. The nearly party-line vote on the resolution \u2014 all but two House Democrats voted for it, while every House Republican opposed it \u2014 sparked complaints from the White House and Trump\u2019s allies that the investigation was allegedly too partisan. Tim Morrison, the national security council official who is stepping down from his post, is testifying to impeachment investigators and reportedly verified much of Bill Taylor\u2019s account of a quid pro quo in the delaying of military aid to Ukraine. The blog will have plenty more coming up, so stay tuned. Representative Lee Zeldin, one of Trump\u2019s congressional allies, is calling on the House intelligence committee to release the transcripts from closed-door depositions in the impeachment inquiry so that lawmakers can debate the \u201csubstance\u201d of the allegations against the president. However, Republicans have so far been fairly hesitant to discuss the substance of the accusations as more witnesses come forward with damning testimony pointing to a quid pro quo in the delaying of military aid to Ukraine. House Republicans and Democrats are holding separate press conferences now in the wake of the impeachment resolution\u2019s passage. Republican leadership unsurprisingly pointed to the nearly party-line vote as evidence that the investigtion is allegedly highly partisan and unfair to Trump. However, it\u2019s worth noting that seemingly none of the Republican messaging against impeachment actually touches on the serious allegations facing the president. As the inquiry moves to public hearings, Republicans may be increasingly asked to weigh in on the accusations, and they\u2019ll need to come up with an answer. The nearly party-line vote on the impeachment resolution marks a departure from how Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment was handled in the House, per an NBC News correspondent. House Republicans will likely cite the final vote count as evidence that the inquiry is highly partisan and unfair to Trump. However, the vote still marks a momentous development in Trump\u2019s presidency and US history, as a PBS NewsHour reporter pointed out. One of the two House Democrats who voted against the impeachment resolution, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, said in a statement that he feared the nearly party-line decision would \u201cfurther divide the country.\u201d However, the freshman congressman left open the possibility of eventually backing Trump\u2019s impeachment depending on where the evidence led investigators. Democratic presidential candidates voiced support for House Democrats after they passed a resolution outlining next steps in the impeachment inquiry. Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and senior adviser, weighed in on the impeachment vote by quoting Thomas Jefferson\u2019s dour reflections on Washington. Nancy Pelosi made the rather unusual decision to cast a vote on the impeachment resolution, marking a departure from House speakers\u2019 general tendency to refrain from weighing in. Four House members\u2060 \u2014 three Republicans and one Democrat \u2060\u2014 were unable to vote on the impeachment resolution due to absences. Trump\u2019s press secretary has now issued a statement slamming Democrats\u2019 \u201cunhinged obsession with this illegitimate impeachment proceeding\u201d in the wake of the resolution\u2019s passage. Stephanie Grisham said in the statement: \u201cThe President has done nothing wrong, and the Democrats know it. Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats\u2019 unhinged obsession with this illegitimate impeachment proceeding does not hurt President Trump; it hurts the American people. ... \u201cWith today\u2019s vote, Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats have done nothing more than enshrine unacceptable violations of due process into House rules. ... The Democrats want to render a verdict without giving the Administration a chance to mount a defense. That is unfair, unconstitutional, and fundamentally un-American.\u201d Speaking at her press briefing this morning, Pelosi said that the rules outlined in the resolution were \u201cfairer than anything that have gone before in terms of an impeachment proceeding.\u201d A bit of chaos has broken out on the House floor following the passage of the impeachment resolution, with Republicans shouting \u201cobjection\u201d and Democrats calling for order. The vote has concluded on the impeachment resolution, and it has officially passed the House with a vote of 232-196. Two Democrats, Colin Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, voted against the resolution, while every House Republican opposed the measure. One independent lawmaker, former Republican Justin Amash, joined the vast majority of Democrats in supporting the resolution. The impeachment resolution has reached a majority level of support, receiving at least least 228 \u201cyea\u201d votes, and it will clear the way for public hearings. Collin Peterson, a Democratic congressman from an overwhelmingly Trump district in Minnesota, voted with Republicans on the procedural vote for the impeachment resolution. There were widespread suspicions that Peterson would not join his Democratic colleagues in backing the resolution, given the political breakdown of his district. Representative Jeff Van Drew also voted against the procedural motion, but the Democratic congressman had previously signaled his opposition. Justin Amash, the Michigan congressman who left the Republican Party over opposition to Trump, has confirmed that he intends to vote for the impeachment resolution. In a morning tweet, Amash encouraged his Republican colleagues to \u201cstep outside your media and social bubble\u201d and consider the historic ramifications of their decision to stand by Trump. House members are currently taking a procedural vote on the impeachment resolution. The vote on the resolution itself will likely begin in about 15 minutes and conclude around 11.30am ET. The House has concluded debate on the impeachment resolution and is moving on to the vote series that will determine whether members approve it. House Republicans are now denouncing the impeachment resolution on the floor, with minority leader Kevin McCarthy accusing Democrats of ignoring other legislative priorities to focus on impeachment. House minority whip Steve Scalise used a poster to repeat his claim that Democrats are pursuing \u201cSoviet-style\u201d tactics with their investigation. However, a New Yorker writer and former Moscow bureau chief for the Washington Post contradicted that assessment of the inquiry. During her press conference, Nancy Pelosi also touched on the subject of Katie Hill, the Democratic congresswoman who announced her resignation Sunday following the release of nude photos of her and allegations of a relationship with one of her staffers. Pelosi praised her fellow California Democrat as an \u201cabsolutely outstanding young public servant\u201d who was \u201crespected by her colleagues.\u201d The House speaker noted that Hill made her own determination about whether and when to resign. \u201cShe made her decision and her timing, and I respect that,\u201d Pelosi said. The speaker also noted that she has warned her grandchildren that \u201cappearances\u201d on social media can be taken out of context and \u201ccome back to haunt you.\u201d Hill is expected to deliver her final floor speech this afternoon, after the vote on the impeachment resolution. \u201cThis resolution sets the stage for the next phase of our investigation, one in which the American people have the opportunity to hear from the witnesses first-hand,\u201d House intelligence chairman Adam Schiff said in a floor speech ahead of the vote. \u201cWe will continue to conduct this inquiry with the seriousness of purpose that our task deserves because it is our duty and because no one is above the law.\u201d Nancy Pelosi opened her remarks on the House floor by reading the \u201cmost beautiful lines in our country\u2019s history\u201d \u2013 the introduction to the US constitution. The House speaker urged support for the resolution by citing a quote attributed to Benjamin Franklin, who, when asked if the Founders had created a republic or a monarchy, is believed to have responded: \u201cA republic if you can keep it.\u201d Nancy Pelosi is now talking to reporters in her weekly press conference, saying that it is a \u201csad day\u201d when lawmakers have to vote on an impeachment measure. The House speaker added that no decision had yet been made on whether members of her caucus would eventually support Trump\u2019s impeachent. However, it seems highly likely that the Democratic-controlled House will soon vote to impeach the president. Nancy Pelosi framed the impeachment resolution, and the inquiry more broadly, as a measure to defend the principles of the US constitution. The House speaker said: \u201cWhat is at stake in all of this is nothing less than our democracy.\u201d Nancy Pelosi is now speaking on the House floor about the impeachment resolution, arguing the measure will enable lawmakers to find the truth about the allegations against Trump. Standing beside an American flag poster, the House speaker said: \u201cThis is a solemn occasion. ... I doubt anybody in this place or anybody that you know ... comes to Congress to impeach the president of the United States unless his actions are jeopardizing honoring our oath of office.\u201d House Democrats have scheduled four depositions on Monday as they look to wrap up the closed-door interviews in the impeachment inquiry and advance to public hearings. It remains unknown whether the officials will comply with the interview requests, given that the White House still refuses to cooperate with the investigation. However, if the depositions were to occur, John Eisenberg\u2019s testimony could prove particularly damaging for Trump. The White House lawyer was reportedly the person who proposed the unusual move of placing the transcript of the Ukraine call in a secure server. The Washington Post reported yesterday: Moments after President Trump ended his phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president on July 25, an unsettled national security aide rushed to the office of White House lawyer John Eisenberg. Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine adviser at the White House, had been listening to the call and was disturbed by the pressure Trump had applied to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rivals, according to people familiar with Vindman\u2019s testimony to lawmakers this week. Vindman told Eisenberg, the White House\u2019s legal adviser on national security issues, that what the president did was wrong, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation. Scribbling notes on a yellow legal pad, Eisenberg proposed a step that other officials have said is at odds with long-standing White House protocol: moving a transcript of the call to a highly classified server and restricting access to it, according to two people familiar with Vindman\u2019s account. House Democrats appear largely unified in support of the resolution outlining next steps in the impeachment inquiry. Only two members of the House Democratic caucus \u2013 Colin Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey \u2013 were expected to vote against the resolution. However, House Republicans were also expected to be unified in opposition to the resolution, so they will likely cite the vote\u2019s outcome to bolster their argument that the investigation is highly partisan. Nancy Pelosi rather unusually presided over the House herself this morning as members began to debate the impeachment resolution. The resolution, which outlines the procedures the House will follow as the inquiry advances to public hearings, will likely get a vote between 10.30am and 11.30am ET. Pelosi is also expected to speak to reporters about the resolution at the House speaker\u2019s press briefing in about 30 minutes. Tim Morrison, the national security council official currently testifying behind closed doors in the impeachment inquiry, reportedly intends to confirm Bill Taylor\u2019s account that the White House held up Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to push for public announcements of investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election. The Washington Post reports: Morrison is expected to tell impeachment investigators on Thursday that the account offered by Ambassador William B. Taylor Jr., is accurate, particularly that Morrison alerted him to the president\u2019s and his deputies\u2019 push to withhold security aid and a meeting with the Ukrainian president until Ukraine announced an investigation of the Bidens and 2016 election interference, the person said on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions. Morrison will also say that he did not necessarily view the president\u2019s demands as improper or illegal, but rather problematic for U.S. policy in supporting an ally in the region, the person said. House Democrats are hoping that Tim Morrison can provide the key link between Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU who has denied any quid pro quo in the delaying of military assistance to Ukraine, and Bill Taylor, who outlined such a scheme in his testimony to impeachment investigators. However, despite Morrison\u2019s imminent departure from the national security council, the official may not be looking to reveal everything he knows to the House committees this morning. The Washington Post\u2019s Josh Rogin writes: Democrats might not want to pin their impeachment hopes on his testimony Thursday, because there are three things Morrison is not: a whistleblower, a Never Trumper or a potential member of the Resistance. ... [Morrison] likely won\u2019t give the Democrats the thing they want most, a full-throated endorsement of their characterization of the Ukraine scheme as a quid pro quo. Morrison will likely try to stick to the facts, be honest and not burn his bosses or the president in the process. That won\u2019t be easy. Good morning, live blog readers! Today\u2019s impeachment proceedings are underway, with Tim Morrison having already arrived for his closed-door testimony with the committees leading the inquiry. Morrison\u2019s appearance was already highly anticipated, given Bill Taylor\u2019s reported testimony last week that the national security council official told him about Gordon Sondland allegedly informing Ukrainian officials their US military aid was contingent on public announcements of investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election. However, Morrison\u2019s testimony is even more dramatic following last night\u2019s reports that the official is stepping down from his post at the White House. It\u2019s still unclear whether Morrison resigned voluntarily or was asked to leave, but the development puts even more weight on what he may tell impeachment investigators today. Here\u2019s what else the bog is keeping an eye on: Trump has no events on his public schedule today, so some impeachment-themed tweets seem likely. The House vote on the impeachment resolution will likely happen between 10.30am and 11.30am ET. Nancy Pelosi will brief reporters at 10.15am ET. The blog will have plenty more coming up, so stay tuned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
