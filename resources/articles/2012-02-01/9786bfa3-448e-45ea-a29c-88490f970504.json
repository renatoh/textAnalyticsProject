It is the story of France's strange voyage in late October to the World Cup final. There was nothing explosive in the serialisation. It was more a matter of fading, failings relationships; long minutes spent in corridors at night; conversations, fraught with things not being said, between himself and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 at 10, Fran\u00e7ois Trinh-Duc; the shadows of players slipping out into the street when the coach thought he was to join them for a few beers. Saint-Andr\u00e9, it would appear, is an excellent mediator and relations are being mended. His team, based solidly on the group that lost by a point to New Zealand in the final, played on Saturday with freshness and obvious enjoyment. The lineout was not perfect, but Italy were magnificently served there, and everywhere, by Sergio Parisse. The French scrum too was nudged here and there by the hefty Italian front five, but in broken play the home backs occasionally found the rhythm that sets them apart in world rugby. At their best, they sweep forward from deep, in waves and at all angles, an unstoppable force. There were glimpses of grand adventures ahead through the counter-attacking of Maxime M\u00e9dard, the power of Julien Malzieu and Aur\u00e9lien Rougerie and the silkiness of the find of the season, Wesley Fofana. The 24-year-old centre looked beset by nerves in the first half, passing to Rougerie as if he had never met him. They play together at Clermont. But in the second half he settled into his routines, looked hungry for the ball and posed a threat with every touch. He finished the day scoring France's fourth try, by which time Italy were flagging and down to 14 players, Quintin Geldenhuys having been sent to the sin-bin for collapsing a maul. It was, then, a comfortable win, but Italy played their part in an enjoyable opener. They were combative, as under Nick Mallett, expressive, according to the designs of their new coach, Jacques Brunel, and still careless with the final pass, as under all their coaches of the past 12 years. France did provide the finishing touches. Trinh-Duc, restored at 10 after Li\u00e8vremont's World Cup experiment with Morgan Parra, set up the third try, for Vincent Clerc, with a delicious chip and volley. For the second, France shoved, for the only time, Italy off the ball at a scrum, and Louis Picamoles, picked ahead of Imanol Harinordoquy in the starting lineup, ran hard and above all straight for the impressive Malzieu to underline Saint\u2011Andr\u00e9's skills as a selector. His changes all made their mark. Rougerie, for the first try, spotted a midfield mismatch and surged between the hooker Leonardo Ghiraldini and the prop Andrea Lo Cicero. If bonus points were awarded in the Six Nations \u2013 they aren't \u2013 the try tally would have earned one. France instead were rewarded with simple smiles, but that said a lot about a team learning to love again.
