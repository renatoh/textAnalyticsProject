The 35-year-old will ache in all areas tomorrow morning, having extended every sinew for the Arsenal cause, yet there is no balm quite like victory. Having felt trapped in a nightmare at League Two Notts County, when he made that one appearance in September, Campbell senses a glorious swan song to the season. In for the injured William Gallas, who faces at least another month on the sidelines, he might have cut a jarring contrast to the whipper-snappers around him but he was part of an Arsenal defence that, despite a few wobbles, did what was asked of it. Thomas Vermaelen, as he has throughout the season, took the plaudits for another composed and steely performance and he helped Campbell through what was an exacting test. The heroes for Arsenal were further forward, in particular Nicklas Bendtner, Samir Nasri and Andrey Arshavin, and questions will remain about whether Campbell has the pace and durability to contribute at this level. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the Arsenal manager, had remarked on the eve of the tie that it was doubtful whether Campbell's body, which seemed to make the ground shudder when he tumbled on to it, can withstand the demands of regular football. Wenger said he was preparing to rotate Campbell and Mika\u00ebl Silvestre in Gallas's absence. But, as Arsenal fashioned their latest thrilling attacking performance, their back-line held up. Porto's lament was that they failed to seriously examine it. Arsenal's stated pre-match aim had been keeping a clean sheet. \"That is the priority,\" said the goalkeeper Manuel Almunia, and Wenger agreed, because Arsenal always back themselves to score at home. They had failed to do so only once in the last 12 months \u2013 against Chelsea in the 3-0 Premier League defeat in November. Porto, moreover, had brought a woeful record to the Emirates, having lost on all six of their previous trips to London, twice at the hands of Arsenal. Indeed, they had failed to win in 13 visits to England and they had never mustered a clean sheet. Arsenal, though, had been sloppy in the first leg, during which the back-up goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski had been horribly at fault for both of the goals conceded. Campbell had been far from blameless for the second, when he passed back to Fabianski at point-blank range, rather than hoofing it into the stands, and then switched off at the subsequent quick free-kick. He knew that total concentration was the minimum requirement here. There were nervous moments for him and the Arsenal defence during a Porto purple patch midway through the first half. The problems were apparent on high balls, whether from corners or open play. From one cross from the inside-left channel, Almunia was called upon to punch. There were one or two murmurs of apprehension. Campbell was muscled aside by Falcao on another occasion. Yet, with offside flags staying down at the other end and Bendtner seizing his opportunity to prove his worth to the team, Arsenal grew in assurance. There was even a sight for sore eyes just before the interval when Campbell rumbled out of defence with the ball at his feet. He went down pretty quickly to win a soft free-kick but the crowd loved it. Supporters jumped out of their seats with their fists clenched. Who said Arsenal were all about finesse? The second half brought one or two more scares before Arsenal eased clear. Nasri was forced to smuggle a header from the substitute Cristian Rodr\u00edguez off the line. But, when he and Arshavin sparkle like this, attack really is the best form of defence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
