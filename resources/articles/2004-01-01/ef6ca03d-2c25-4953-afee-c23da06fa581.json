Whare Kea Alpine Chalet, South Island, New Zealand That this chalet is special is apparent as soon as you \u00dend out how you get there - via a 15-minute helicopter ride from Whare Kea Lodge on Lake Wanaka.

The rustic chalet, with external loo for environmental reasons, opens in March. Price: About \u00a3300 for the chalet per night including helicopter transfers, through wharekealodge.com/alpinechalet.htm.

Hotel Eden, Arosa, Switzerland The bedrooms here are designed to ful\u00del your wildest dreams. A bed with fake fur and velvet behind bars is the theme of the Tiger Lilly room.

The nightclub here is called The Kitchen Club and is decked out with appliances so people end up dancing on stoves, and drinks are served from stainless steel sinks.

Rooms are light, spacious and airy, with swish modern furnishings. The loft-style designer bedrooms have bathrooms whose walls are made from frosted glass.

Hotel Dom, Saas Fee, Switzerland Walk into this historic turn-of-the-century building and you'll have your breath taken away. A piano hangs suspended from the ceiling, the \u00dereplace is bright yellow and there are stacks of computers. There's also a popcorn bar, complete with old petrol pumps and Coco-Cola signs. This is where most of the town's snowboarders hang out, so the hotel's young, funky clientele is probably responsible for the laidback feeling throughout. And the bedrooms have PlayStations and CD players. Price: B&amp;B at the Hotel Dom (00 41 27 957 5101) costs from \u00a350 a night or \u00a3330 pp per week. 9.
