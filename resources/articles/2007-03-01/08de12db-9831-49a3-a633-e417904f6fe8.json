A victory here would have seen them looking up the table, said Chris Coleman, instead of looking down. But a share of the points between the Premiership's draw specialists left them effectively looking sideways. Coleman put it slightly differently but admitted that the rest of the season will be an exercise in contortion. \"It's difficult because we are still looking both ways. We have to be aware of the bottom three but we have to be positive and look forward.\" Tenth place is the position Fulham's manger covets. Martin O'Neill would probably settle for the same place with his Aston Villa side. That seems a lowly ambition for the Midland's pre-eminent club under American ownership but Villa and their hosts, twinned now on 33 points, are currently members of the Premiership's lower-middle classes. This game proved as much - short on class, going nowhere fast. Both managers suggested a couple of victories would do the trick, banishing relegation fears and pointing their clubs towards the top half. \"We're only two wins away from being OK,\" O'Neill mused before adding, with mock optimism: \"And we should get that in the next two games - against Arsenal and Liverpool.\" The referee Lee Mason, too, found himself in a difficult position. Mason inadvertently blocked Alexey Smertin from reaching Michael Brown's pass near Fulham's area, enabling Gareth Barry to advance and slip in John Carew, for once not offside, to roll in an angled shot. To double Fulham's sense of injustice, they felt Smertin had been fouled by Barry's powerful challenge only seconds before. After a sharp attack on officialdom following the home defeat by Manchester United the previous weekend, Coleman was now on the defensive. \"We were disappointed but the referee can't see behind him. I've got to be a bit careful. I got into a little bit of trouble last week and I've got to sit on the fence.\" It would have been worse for Fulham if Antti Niemi had not been in the right position to divert Carew's close-range shot in injury-time. It was a magnificent - and brave - save from a goalkeeper who has missed the best part of two months after an awkward fall and disturbing neck injury on New Year's Day. Niemi returned for one game at the end of January - \"a little bit too early,\" in his words - but saw Saturday's as his real comeback match. The 34-year-old Finn said: \"I haven't been nervous on a football pitch for a long time but today I was a bit . [The injury] could have been a lot worse and I consider myself lucky. I landed on my neck and felt the pain on the right-hand side. There was a little break in there. I was a bit scared because this side [right shoulder/neck] was numb. It was nowhere near the spinal column, though, it was near the joint. But it has healed and is fine now.\" Thomas Sorensen suffered more alarms, seeing Brown's deflected volley hit the bar and another shot from Fulham's captain rattle a post. Brown was denied a third time as the goalkeeper parried a low drive. Sorensen was poorly protected when Fulham rapidly equalised, beaten by Carlos Bocanegra's diving header from Franck Queudrue's free-kick. Villa's performance after a three-week break frustrated O'Neill: \"We can play much better. We weren't fluent.\" Of the campaign he added: \"I didn't get carried away with a good start to the season.\" With classic understatement he pointed out: \"It will take a little bit of time\" to get the club where he wants it to be.
