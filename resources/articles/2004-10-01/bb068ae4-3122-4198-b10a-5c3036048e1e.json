The Ipswich striker gave Finland an early lead and completed the scoring three minutes from time. Earlier, Armen Shakhgeldyan pulled a goal back for Armenia shortly after Aleksei Eremenko had doubled the lead. Romania were certain to remain top of the group, having already beaten Finland, but lost 1-0 to a Jan Koller penalty for the Czech Republic . Sweden beat Hungary 3-0 in Group 8 late on, with goals from Fredrik Ljungberg, Henrik Larsson and Anders Svensson. In Africa, Libya went top of Group 3 with a 2-1 victory over Egypt , though Cameroon were hoping to join them on 10 points with victory in Sudan last night and Ivory Coast can reach the same mark by winning in Benin today. Tunisia 's hopes in Group 5 were damaged by a 2-2 draw in Malawi , though this represented an escape for the African champions, who scored twice in the last 10 minutes to secure their point. Australia and the Solomon Islands will meet in a World Cup play-off next year, to decide who goes forward from Oceania to play the fifth-placed team in South America for a place in the finals. The teams are currently staging a dress rehearsal, in the play-offs for the 2005 Confederations Cup, in which Australia are living up to their status as firm favourites. Josip Skoko scored twice in Honiara as Australia won the away leg 5-1, making Tuesday's second leg in Sydney a formality. The Socceroos began well in hot conditions at Lawson Tama Stadium when Blackburn Rovers midfielder Brett Emerton crossed for Skoko to score from the edge of the box in the fifth minute. Ante Milicic put Australia 2-0 ahead in the 19th minute and the 28-year-old Skoko scored his second from close range after a pass from Milicic in the 28th. Emerton made it 4-0 in the 43rd minute after an Ahmad Elrich cross from the left to the back post. Batrum Suri delighted a sell-out crowd of 21,500 with a well struck goal for the home side on the hour, before Elrich wrapped up the scoring with 11 minutes left. Australia were missing a string of leading players including strikers Harry Kewell, Mark Viduka and John Aloisi through injury. Kewell and Aloisi are expected to recover from leg strains in time to play on Tuesday, but Frank Farina, the Australia coach, may think there is no point in fielding them. 'The guys played a very professional game,' Farina said. 'It was very hot, very humid and it took its toll in the second half. We had a really good first half and shut it down.' It was Australia's failure to play to potential in their World Cup group game against the Solomons, a 2-2 draw, that enabled the islanders to qualify for the play-offs at the expense of New Zealand. The Confederations Cup play-off winners will represent Oceania at next year's tournament in Germany alongside Brazil, Tunisia, Greece, Mexico, Argentina, Japan and the hosts.
