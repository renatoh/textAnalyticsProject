Doubtless this modest hat tip to the divine is a disservice to Morrison\u2019s efforts, given that the truth is much more human and prosaic: the prime minister ran a superior campaign to his political opponent. That\u2019s not to say miracles don\u2019t happen, of course, and the Bad Blood documentary on Sky News makes it clear what the real miracle actually was. The miracle we\u2019ve witnessed is a great disappearing act: the Coalition was able to hide its own animus from the voters sufficiently to win an election on 18 May. Quite something, that pea and thimble operation. Here are five things we\u2019ve learned from David Speers\u2019 typically forensic documentary. 1. Thank heavens for Sky\u2019s comparatively small audience That\u2019s me, channelling Morrison in the event he curled up on Tuesday night with a packet of Tim Tams to see whether the finished product treated him more kindly than Sky\u2019s advance marketing. If you don\u2019t have Foxtel, and have no idea what I\u2019m talking about, the prime minister has been smirking on high rotation over the past couple of weeks in the promos for the two-part documentary on how the government blew itself to bits last August. As forward sizzle goes, it\u2019s not been that kind. Fortunately from a newly re-elected prime minister\u2019s perspective, Sky\u2019s audience is not large. The striking thing about the first episode is how successfully it took me back to the maddest couple of weeks I\u2019ve yet witnessed in 20-plus years of political reporting. Boom. You are back there, watching the protagonists narrate their own self-absorbed madness with varying degrees of comprehension, insight, self-knowledge and candour. You are reminded that this group of people declared war on one another at taxpayer expense, and then managed to sweep their war entirely out of view for the duration of an election contest. It\u2019s a bit like meeting up with the relative you haven\u2019t seen since last Christmas, the one that\u2019s been on the serious health kick, but won\u2019t throw out the old suits just in case the cheese platter proves too hard to resist. He\u2019s nibbling on the carrot sticks but the eyes are on the brie. 2. There was no big reveal This was a sequence of insights that added texture to a story that has already been carefully documented. The former trade minister Steve Ciobo had a new thought. He told Speers Dutton had revealed to him on the Sunday before everything went absolutely bonkers that he had the numbers to blast Malcolm Turnbull from the leadership. I think Ciobo\u2019s words were he was \u201crelatively confident\u201d Dutton had the numbers. This had been confided during a plane ride to Canberra before a special cabinet session on the Sunday evening that was meant to reconfigure the national energy guarantee in a way that would calm things down. Just in case you were wondering, things didn\u2019t calm down. Sorry if that was a spoiler. 3. Peter Dutton never takes a backward step It\u2019s not much of an insight to observe that the home affairs minister, he of the \u201crelatively confident\u201d (oops) numbers, only has one speed. If the cliff approaches, accelerate. But the Dutton story arc was memorable in episode one, even if it just played entirely to type. Let\u2019s just call it Peter Dutton: The No Remorse Story. In this version of history, Malcolm had it coming. Turnbull was a dope who called a leadership spill early in the week (\u201cthe final act of misjudgment\u201d), underscoring his lack of political nous. Turnbull then offered Dutton the deputy Liberal leadership, which wasn\u2019t his gift to give. Turnbull was the mean bastard who wouldn\u2019t let Dutton just take the prime ministership from him without forcing the plotters to put their names to a petition. Turnbull seeking concrete evidence he\u2019d lost the support of the party room was just \u201ca stalling tactic to damage me\u201d and a sign he had reverted to \u201cmerchant banker mode\u201d (possibly that was the counting of names on a petition, it wasn\u2019t really clear). In any case, Pete\u2019s not sorry. He\u2019s a bit sorry he lost when Turnbull called on the death match by demanding that people put their name to their intrigue, in the process handing Morrison, and not Dutton, the prime ministership, thereby outflanking him at the critical juncture. Bit sorry about that. But that\u2019s just Malcolm, isn\u2019t it? An idiot. Obviously. Yeah. Um. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning 4. Mathias Cormann is \u2026 shook Just as Dutton\u2019s political character is fixed, seemingly devoid of surprises, the finance minister also opened his participation in part one, perhaps imagining that talking points might be the flotation device to get him through a cameo in some uncomfortable television. The famously on-message Cormann refused to confirm whether or not Turnbull had offered Dutton the deputy leadership in the melee despite being a primary witness to the conversation, and despite appearing on camera in a program where spilling your guts is the price of entry. But after that awkward I\u2019m-not-getting-into-that-David, the Cormann character was prised open a few degrees. The experience of being personally close to Turnbull and then becoming the most significant person in putting him to the sword in WTF week clearly wasn\u2019t easy. At one point Cormann noted it had been a \u201cdifficult week\u201d and he had been trying to make the right judgments. He did not betray Turnbull, he insisted, because he\u2019d tried to be straight with him throughout. There were flickers of some emotional range. 5. The Craig and Arthur show Craig Laundy\u2019s role in the car crash has already been well canvassed, mostly by Laundy himself, who suffered a trauma and, not being an automaton, has needed to process it in a number of subsequent conversations \u2013 including one with me last year, which remains the most truthful on-the-record account I\u2019ve heard from a politician about the manifest inhumanity of contemporary political life. Laundy, an outside recruit to politics, and Arthur Sinodinos, the ultimate political insider, piloted Turnbull to the end of his prime ministership on the Friday when Morrison emerged with the prize. Sinodinos explained that vigil for him was about loyalty \u2013 Turnbull had been loyal to him when it had counted, and generosity demanded reciprocity. Laundy was asked by Speers whether he was emotional at that moment of walking Turnbull to his political end. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t emotional in that moment, you weren\u2019t human,\u201d Laundy said, and the words hung in the air."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
