Three women \u2013 Lucinda Hartley, Dr Jacq Romero and Riva Mendoza \u2013 are at the forefront in their traditionally male-dominated fields to find ways of using data that improves our privacy, our neighbourhoods, and our wellbeing. Digital data mapping out real-world interactions Lucinda Hartley believes that how we treat data can benefit society on many levels. She is chief innovation officer of Neighbourlytics, a social data analytics platform for neighbourhoods which harnesses real-time digital data to help property developers and governments make evidence-based decisions that maximise the impact of their projects and measure wellbeing. \u201cWe\u2019re so focused on getting the right roads and the right infrastructure that we often forget that the messy human side is also what creates real value in our cities,\u201d says Hartley. Neighbourlytics examines how people use space within neighbourhoods. \u201cWe draw from social data that\u2019s reflective of people\u2019s behaviour and lifestyle choices,\u201d she says. \u201cWe use sources such as social media, Google Maps, and event pages to collect millions of data points on how people interact with their communities, and what assets and opportunities are available. It\u2019s like X-raying your neighbourhood. You see things you weren\u2019t aware of.\u201d Hartley recounts working in the outer-suburban developments of Greenfields in Victoria. \u201cIn many ways these neighbourhoods look very quiet, almost like dormitory suburbs. But we found this incredible density of home-based businesses. There was a huge amount of business activity going on, just not in a way that was visible on the street.\u201d Such social information helps property developers and governments not only make more informed decisions around what infrastructure is needed but also to assess how their projects contribute to the wellbeing of the city. \u201cWe\u2019re in the sweet spot of helping property developers achieve both their social and economic objectives,\u201d says Hartley. \u201cThe property sector has realised that the places that have the best cultural and social life also have better sales, longer tenancies, and better returns. Everyone wants to create liveable neighbourhoods because they produce the best lifestyle outcomes and the best returns.\u201d More than 80 percent of Australians live in cities, so it\u2019s important that they let people thrive. \u201cYour postcode is as likely to determine your life expectancy as your genetic code,\u201d Hartley explains. People are healthier when they can access meaningful work and spaces like parks that foster their wellbeing; when they\u2019re involved in their community; and when they have strong social connections. Digital communication, but not as we know it We know that the laws of physics rule the natural world, and they have extensive applications in the tech world too. Quantum physicists across the globe are locked in a race to build the world\u2019s first proper quantum computer, while the rest of us are still trying to understand what the term means. Quantum computing is an entirely different beast to computing as we know it today - it\u2019s like comparing a bicycle to a F1 supercar. It will radically change our approach on everything from data security, to health outcomes. At the moment, calculating properties of molecules for drug development is too difficult for most supercomputers, but a quantum computer operates on the same properties of the molecules it reads, which has incredible potential for unlocking new cures. But quantum computing in just one application. Quantum communication \u2013 to create hacker-proof information highways - is another. Dr Jacq Romero, a quantum physicist at the University of Queensland and Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Engineered Quantum Systems, is well-versed in the possibilities these new technologies will present. Most computers work to a binary code, but information in the quantum world can be much richer. Rather than ones and zeros, Romero encodes data using the shape of photons, the basic units of light. \u201cThe most exciting aspect for me is that quantum physics can lead to powerful technologies for the future,\u201d says Romero. \u201cI\u2019m exploring the possibilities to develop hacker-proof communication technologies.\u201d \u201cYou can have light of different shapes \u2013 we can make it doughnut-shaped, flower-shaped, anything you like. These shapes are like an alphabet that can encode information, and we can use them to send messages.\u201d When data is being sent using quantum communication, you can tell if it\u2019s being hacked. Information encoded in quantum systems, like single photons, is fragile. An eavesdropper can easily scramble the information being sent \u2013 the parties communicating would know there is an eavesdropper and therefore could stop sending information. \u201cTo maintain privacy, we must make sure that information is physically secure in the first place. Quantum physics can give us perfectly secure communication, that\u2019s the big picture I\u2019m working towards,\u201d says Romero. This translates to higher levels of security for our personal health and financial records, less cyberattacks and hacking of sensitive government and military information, and a more secure online experience for everyone. \u201cIn the future, if we make it more scalable, quantum communication can be used more widely in industries where secure communication is critical to their operations, like banks and government,\u201d says Romero. \u201cThat\u2019s my aspiration: to make it easier for people to have access to quantum communication technologies. I want to make hacking impossible.\u201d Are you becoming your own Tamagotchi? Riva Mendoza, a third-year undergraduate in statistics and computer science at Queensland University of Technology, also wants to utilise data to improve wellbeing. While experiencing depression, Mendoza realised that technology played a huge role for her self-care. She used her phone to track her exercise levels, mood, and sleep. She also used meditation apps for support. \u201cI was becoming my own Tamagotchi,\u201d she jokes. \u201cThere\u2019s so much data that\u2019s being collected right now by every company, every app. Data is great for tailoring ads and keeping people engaged with products, but I want to use it to improve people\u2019s overall health and wellbeing.\u201d Like Hartley and Romero, Mendoza\u2019s work has been supported by the Westpac Scholars Trust. After reading about the scholarship while she was in her final years of school, Mendoza decided to work towards securing one. Initially, the funding attracted her interest, but, she reflects, \u201cIt\u2019s so much more than that. I\u2019ve met so many wonderful people and I learned how to build a professional network.\u201d Her involvement with the Westpac Scholars Network snowballed into other opportunities, traveling to a range of countries through her connections to learn how computer and data science changes lives. It has also helped her succeed in a traditionally male-dominated field. \u201cThe gender balance is daunting sometimes, when you\u2019re in a lab with two girls and thirteen guys. The scholarship gave me the confidence to keep putting myself out there,\u201d says Mendoza. Romero has had a similar experience. As part of her Westpac Research Fellowship, she is collaborating with others in the industry. \u201cIt has expanded my perspective, this is not something I\u2019d get just by talking to other physicists, you need to engage with other people,\u201d she says. \u201cTalking to others within the Scholars Network, you get a sense that they sincerely want to help you achieve your vision. That backing helps me be bolder and more ambitious.\u201d Hartley\u2019s background is urban design, and she\u2019s likewise expanded her perspective through her Fellowship to study data analytics, as well as travel to cities throughout the world in order to develop her ideas. Neighbourlytics launched just two years ago and is already operating in ten countries and has tripled in size over the last three months. \u201cIt\u2019s an extremely exciting place to be,\u201d says Hartley. With the support of the Westpac Scholars Trust, the innovative ways these scholars are working with data promises exciting new technological developments in privacy, urban design, and wellbeing. For them, data is not simply something to monetise, but a resource to support human lives and values.
