Five albums later, the gloom keeps on flowing - favoured topics include career failure and romantic catastrophe. But it's good robust Scottish gloom, served with a chaser of wry humour - on \"Carry Me\", the narrator realises with a start that he hasn't been spending his life \"partying in Rio in yachts with my white suit on\". The self-produced songs tend to go on a bit but Middleton's affable presence keeps the enterprise afloat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
