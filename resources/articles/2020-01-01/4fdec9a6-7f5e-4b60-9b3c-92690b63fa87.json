More than 11,000 readers have so far given to the appeal, which promotes environmental and social justice through natural climate solutions, from safeguarding rainforests in the Amazon basin to rewilding the Scottish Highlands and greening Britain\u2019s towns, cities and countryside. The appeal closes at midnight on Sunday 12 January. The four charities supported through the appeal are: Woodland Trust, Trees for Life, Trees for Cities and Global Greengrants Fund UK. David Elliott, chief executive of Trees for Cities, said: \u201cWe are inspired and humbled by the amazing level of engagement that readers have shown for this appeal. Their support will significantly help our organisations create a landscape shift \u2013 in more than one sense \u2013 that is so urgently and vitally needed. Restoring and protecting our natural environment is one of the most effective actions we can take to push back against the escalating impacts of the climate crisis.\u201d Cristina Orpheo, of Global Greengrants Fund\u2019s local partner in Brazil, CASA Socio-Environmental Fund, said: \u201cMany thanks to all who responded to the Guardian and Observer charity appeal. The funds designated for Global Greengrants Fund and its partners will be used to support traditional communities and improve their living conditions so that they have a better chance of promoting the preservation and protection of this great biome for future generations.\u201d Scores of donors have left online messages explaining why they gave to the appeal. Many said it was to signal their frustration with governments\u2019 failure to take the climate crisis seriously, and the slow institutional political response to what they considered to be the most important issue facing the planet. One reader said: \u201cAt a time that feels very bleak, these projects not only offer some comfort, but powerful examples of how we can overcome our individual despair and seek to build a better future together.\u201d \u2022 The appeal ends at midnight on Sunday 12 January. Readers can donate online here or send a cheque (payable to the Guardian and Observer charity appeal 2019) to: The Guardian and Observer charity appeal 2019, Charities Trust, Suite 20-22, Century Building, Tower Street, Liverpool L3 4BJ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
