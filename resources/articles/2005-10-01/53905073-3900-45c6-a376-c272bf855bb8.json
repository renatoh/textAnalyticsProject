It was the south-west front of one of two terraces of new homes built by the Somerset Trust for Sustainable Development. This was my first sight of the realisation of a concept described to me two and a half years ago - the creation of healthy living spaces with a reduction in carbon emissions and water consumption, of structures that \"leave a smaller footprint on the earth\" than traditional buildings, and the use of local resources, human and material, in their design and construction, providing a stimulus to the local economy. Seven of the 12 almost-complete houses are already sold. I was taken on a tour. Upstairs from a ground-floor garage or workshop, in the light and airy open-plan spaces, with balconies, you feel as if you are part of the landscape. The orientation and use of glass invite the eye across the river on one side or the town moor (with grazing cattle) on the other. And of course they make for the best use of the sun's light and warmth, while wooden louvres provide and regulate the shade. The brick used in the new buildings is recycled and from Bridgwater, just down river, with its tradition of brick and tile manufacture: local clay worked by local hands. It matches the lovely courses of rose-coloured 18th-century brick, finely pointed with lime mortar, in the wharfside warehouse. The wood (lime-washed pine inside, of a lovely pinkish grey) is local too. And they aim to revive the overgrown wharf and the tradition of river traffic, as the restored warehouse becomes a new centre for artists and craft workers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
