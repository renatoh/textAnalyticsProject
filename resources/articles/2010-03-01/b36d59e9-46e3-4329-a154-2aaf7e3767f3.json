Naturally, they play Grieg, who directed the orchestra in the 1880s, as if his music were imprinted on their DNA; still, the piece chosen for this programme \u2013 an orchestral expansion of the piano miniature Bell Ringing \u2013 was an oddity never sanctioned by Grieg. It is a strikingly unconventional, if slightly ephemeral piece, based on a hypnotically uninterrupted two-note pattern of tolling fifths. Grieg may have had the bell towers of Bergen in mind, yet the effect sounds uncannily like an early Nordic form of minimalism. Of Prokofiev's Five Piano Concertos, the Third has come to be regarded as the most suitable for public consumption. Freddy Kempf eased into it with light-fingered lyricism; yet bashed out the perilously high triads at the end of the first movement so hard that a string gave way. \"He's having trouble with his radio reception,\" conductor Andrew Litton commented, as Kempf fished around to remove the antenna-like thread from his Steinway's innards. Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony is a hair-raising creation, which gained additional power when Litton let his sophisticated, tasteful players off the leash. The cellos and basses played with paranoid intensity: they restated the initial theme as if it had just been woken up in the middle of the night by the secret police hammering at the door.
