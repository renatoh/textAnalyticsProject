It was a brave idea to invite a selection of Latin singers to pay tribute to a band who had a massive influence on the Spanish-speaking world, but it didn't quite work. An impressive lineup from Spain, Mexico, America and Chile turned out to rework the old favourites, backed by a rousing 13-piece band that included an accordion and five-piece brass section, but only occasionally did they match the power of the originals or offer anything wildly different. Joe Strummer and Mick Jones may have travelled widely in the Spanish-speaking world, but their key influences were early rock'n'roll and Jamaican dub and reggae, and it wasn't always easy for these artists to revive their songs (usually in English, with lyrics displayed on music stands) without sounding too reverential. The best moments were those where the punk-era classics were given a dramatically new Latin setting, as when Ruben Albarr\u00e1n of Mexico's Cafe Tacuba stopped playing around with voice-distorting effects and produced a spirited, accordion-backed treatment of Complete Control, or Barcelona's Amparo S\u00e1nchez provided a confident, largely Spanish, treatment of Spanish Bombs or Police On My Back. The rest was patchy, but saved by the strength of the songs. Jonaz, from Mexico's Plastilina Mosh, provided a straightforward treatment of London Calling, Bruno \"Sergent\" Garcia delivered a brassy Bankrobber but failed to Rock the Casbah, and Escovedo was at his best when he threw in a song of his own, chronicling his meetings with the Sex Pistols. By 9.15pm, just as the audience were beginning to respond to an ensemble treatment of Radio Clash, this curiously brief Latin punk revue was over."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
