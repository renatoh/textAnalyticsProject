Their fears have been echoed by National Disability Services, the peak body for non-government services, which says disability providers across the country are struggling to remain viable. Ken Baker, chief executive of the NDS, said two-thirds of disability service providers had reported to the commission that they were \u201cvery worried about their capacity to provide services at current NDIS prices\u201d. \u201cI think something has to give,\u201d Baker told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe concern that I would have, is that in trying to meet those very, very tight prices, there are compromises made on quality. That inexperienced staff are being employed, instead of experienced staff. \u201cThose sorts of choices are being forced on providers. We don\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d Currently, the prices a disability provider can charge for NDIS services are set by the national disability insurance agency and reviewed annually, to take into account changing costs, inflation, and wage growth. To remain viable, services must find a way to operate within the confines of NDIS pricing. A loading bonus of 20-25% is given to rural and remote services, but the sector says the definition of \u201cregional and remote\u201d is so narrow that it excludes large swathes of regional Australia. The Cerebral Palsy Alliance is one provider concerned about the future of some of its regional services. It operates 55 sites across cities and in regional and rural New South Wales. Its chief executive, Rob White, said one of its sites on NSW\u2019s south coast has already had to pause most of its therapy services. \u201cIt is going to be much harder, under the funding model, to be providing therapy support to people in areas where there is low demand over high geographical spans of landscape, and the south coast has always been that,\u201d White said. \u201cWe\u2019re great advocates for NDIS, but service providers will find it difficult to continue to fund this with their own resources. \u201cThe more remote, the harder it gets, because the funding model is not taking that into account. And that\u2019s going to be the case, especially for therapy services.\u201d Another provider in a regional area of southern NSW, which currently runs early childhood intervention services, said it was facing the possibility of shutting down altogether. The head of the provider, speaking anonymously, warned state funding was being withdrawn before NDIS funding was becoming available. \u201cIt\u2019s creating a lot of uncertainty, we\u2019re not sure how we\u2019ll be able to operate in a year\u2019s time,\u201d the source said. \u201cWe have to look at all aspects of our services and see what we\u2019re able to provide.\u201d Others warn the pricing problem is not isolated to regional Australia. Roland Naufal, director of Disability Services Consulting, said price levels were currently too low to sustain most existing service providers. \u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing \u2013 and we work with thousands of providers around Australia \u2013 is that some of them are really seriously struggling. Some of them may even exit the space, and some of them may be forced to close down,\u201d Naufal said. \u201cSome new players are coming in but they will not get to scale before the other guys get into trouble. So we\u2019ve got a seismic issue, we\u2019ve got a very significant portion of the sector saying \u2018we can\u2019t do this\u2019.\u201d Naufal \u2013 along with the overwhelming majority in the sector \u2013 welcomes the NDIS as a \u201cfantastic scheme\u201d. But he says the planning process has \u201cleft a lot to be desired\u201d, and says bipartisan support has limited public scrutiny of the scheme. The federal government commissioned an independent review into pricing in June, to be conducted by McKinsey&amp; Company. The ultimate aim is to completely deregulate prices, once the market matures in \u201csize, quality and innovation\u201d. A spokesman for the National Disability Insurance Agency said the review would consider pricing in regional and remote areas. He said the agency was aware of the challenges of delivering services in regional Australia, and pointed to the price loading allowances. \u201cThe pricing review, which will consider pricing in regional and remote areas, will deliver its final report to the Board by the end of this year,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThe NDIA approach to pricing balances the need for reasonable price increases for providers and keeping supports affordable for participants, including those in regional areas.\u201d Baker said he held faith in the review process. But he urged it to address unrealistic assumptions that were made about underlying costs of service providers. For example, it assumes 95% of a disability support providers\u2019 work hours are billable to clients. That ignores the time spent on tasks such as paperwork and travel, he said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of another occupational profession where that assumption would be made. It\u2019s quite unrealistic,\u201d Baker said. Baker said the supply of disability services would need to double to meet demand under the NDIS, requiring services to expand at a \u201cvery ambitious rate\u201d. \u201cUnless organisations are confident that they can have enough income to invest in growth, they can\u2019t do it,\u201d Baker said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what we\u2019re in danger of seeing, that the gap between supply and demand is going to grow.\u201d The NDIA spokesman said the number of registered NDIS service providers grew by 28 per cent to 8968 by the end of June. But Baker said 54% of those providers were inactive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
