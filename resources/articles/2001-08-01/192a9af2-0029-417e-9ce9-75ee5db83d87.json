For as Popstars proved, it is perfectly possible to create a plastic pop band that can sing, dance and look vaguely sexy, even at the same time. But on this display, the Kittens would have been unlikely to qualify for Nasty Nigel's Birmingham call-back, let alone make it to the final five: the Liverpudlian trio would have been booed off the stage in Bootle if they had dared come on with an act so threadbare. If you are going to put three young women on stage to sing soulful close-harmony pop, you have to make sure they have at least a passing familiarity with the concept. Yet in the live rendition of their otherwise creditable number one cover of the Bangles' Eternal Flame, the Kittens let the audience fill in the gaps. All this could have been forgiven if the rest of the act made up for it. But little thought had been put into the performance: there were no costume changes, and not a hot pant in sight. We weren't expecting fire and ice, but some hip-swinging would have helped. The appearance of Big Brother winner and Atomic Kitten fan Brian Dowling was a risk: had he introduced the band, as originally billed, the rest would have been a let-down. Instead, he was held back until the relative safety of the encore set. Only the dancing boys seemed to have spent more than an afternoon in the rehearsal rooms, stealing the show whenever they came on stage. They even managed to make sweatbands look sexy.
