Walter Smith yesterday completed the signing of the combative Swedish international Tobias Linderoth from Stabaek for an initial \u00a32m, which will rise by a further \u00a31m depending on appearances. He will now turn his attention to the Coventry midfielder. The Sky Blues are unwilling to sell a player they paid \u00a32m for themselves in December 2000 but, with a debt of \u00a360m, are in no position to spurn lucrative offers. It is the second time Everton have tried to sign Carsley; Howard Kendall failed while Carsley was at Derby. Liverpool's Portuguese international Abel Xavier, an \u00a3800,000 recruit from Everton on Wednesday, has urged his new club to sign his compatriot Nuno Gomes from Fiorentina. The striker is currently in dispute with the cash-strapped Serie A strugglers, seeking to have his contract annulled, and could soon be available on a free transfer. \"It would be great for him and for Liverpool if he joined us,\" said Xavier. \"I have no doubt that his style would be perfectly suited for the Premiership. Hopefully with me around it would be another reason for him choosing us.\" Benito Carbone was yesterday fined two weeks' wages and warned as to his future conduct after refusing to be a substitute in Tuesday's game against Preston. Tottenham's Kasey Keller saved two penalties as America beat Canada on penalties to qualify for the Concacaf Gold Cup final. They will play Costa Rica, for whom Manchester City's Paulo Wanchope scored twice as they beat South Korea 3-1. \u00b7 Tunisia became the only African World Cup qualifier to go out of the African Nations Cup at the first stage after being held to a 0-0 draw by Senegal yesterday. The north Africans failed to score in their three group games, though they had enough chances against Senegal, who had already qualified for the quarter-finals. The best, a second-half penalty from Slim Benachor, was saved. In yesterday's other game Egypt set up a quarter-final with the favourites Cameroon by beating Zambia 2-1. Quarter-final draw: Sunday: Mali v South Africa (Kayes, 4pm); Nigeria v Ghana (Bamako, 7pm). Monday: Cameroon v Egypt (Sikasso, 4pm); DR Congo v Senegal (Bamako, 7pm)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
