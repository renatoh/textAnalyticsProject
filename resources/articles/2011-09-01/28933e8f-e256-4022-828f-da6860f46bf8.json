Orient, without a win this season, had scored a 64th-minute equaliser, through David Mooney, after Blackburn had gone ahead a minute before the break with a Jason Roberts penalty. The Premier League team pressed in the second half, with the promising Rochina side-footing them back into the lead in the 71st minute and Vukcevic making it 3-1 four minutes later. Dean Cox scored a late consolation for the visitors. Kean said: \"I thought we made hard going of it and I wasn't too pleased with how we played the first half. We were a bit slow with our passing, there were too many backwards and square and when Orient had it we didn't show enough intensity to get it back so I thought we were poor. \"But reflecting on the whole game, when they came back into it we should have been four or five goals in front. But for poor finishing and a good goalkeeping performance I think the game would have been out of sight. I felt we had the possession but we didn't get it out wide.\" Wolverhampton Wanderers scored twice in the first 10 minutes on the way to beating the Championship side Millwall 5-0, with goals from David Edwards, Adam Hammill, George Elokobi, James Spray and Adl\u00e8ne Gu\u00e9dioura. Middlesbrough were undone by goals from Wilfried Zaha and Calvin Andrew in a 2-1 defeat by Crystal Palace. Merouane Zemmama scored for Boro at Selhurst Park. Burnley beat the League One club MK Dons 2-1 at Turf Moor. Daniel Powell put the visitors ahead after six minutes before Kieran Trippier equalised and Andr\u00e9 Amougou scored the winner one minutes from time. Aldershot caused a minor upset with a 2-1 home win over League One Rochdale. Ashley Grimes put Rochdale ahead but second\u2011half strikes from Michael Rankine and Danny Hylton won it for the League Two club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
