I think it's a freak rather than a shift in the world order but it gives the quarter-finals a special flavour. Every World Cup has thrown up surprises, especially recent ones. You only have to think about Cameroon in 1990 and Nigeria in 1994. But I can't remember as many shocks as here and by tomorrow evening Africa and Asia could have their first semi-finalists. Everyone wants to see whether South Korea can add Spain to their list of victims. What they've achieved in beating Poland, Portugal and Italy is unbelievable. If they don't relax and take the view they've done enough, they could cause the Spanish a lot of problems. Spain were my second choice behind Brazil to win the World Cup and, while they must be happy to have avoided Italy, they will be very aware of Korea's threat. Back in Spain they'll be expected to go through and the weight of expectancy could work against them. Korea caught my eye with their second-half performance against England in a warm-up game and I felt they'd be a better bet than Japan. They have more pace, aggression and drive and a first-class coach in Guus Hiddink. Hiddink's become a national hero but even before they kicked a ball I thought he could tussle with anybody, given his reputation and success. The side he's built in 17 months is a credit to him. He was clever enough and persuasive enough to organise friendlies against tough opponents. Even though his team took a few hammerings at first, they've benefited from that. Korea are a more than decent team but there's no doubt they've been carried along on the public emotion. It's been exciting just watching their fans before, during and after matches. I'm not sure the infrastructure is there to maintain this level and I expect Hiddink to step down, which would be a big blow. He's so popular he could become president but I think he'll fancy the cut and thrust of Europe again, with a top club or a national side. Bruno Metsu is another coach who's done a great job. I was impressed by Senegal against France and they've carried that on. When you consider they were runners-up in the African Nations Cup and their players are in France's top division, they weren't going to be mugs. I was impressed with the organisation and individual flair - particularly El Hadji Diouf and Khalilou Fadiga, who reminds me of John Barnes. Their game tomorrow against Turkey is hard to call. The Turks can be volatile but I think Senegal can look after themselves in a scrap. They've got real power, not least in Pape Bouba Diop, who's made his presence felt when the opposition have the ball and also in opponents' penalty areas by getting three goals. There's been a lot of hype that the winner of England-Brazil will reach the final but I wouldn't bet on it. It wouldn't be a cake walk against Turkey or Senegal, especially the African side. The longer-term question for Senegal is whether they can build on this success. Cameroon and Nigeria failed to do that and I fear it will be the same. I doubt they have the continuity, with a youth system in place producing other equally talented young players who could replace three or four at the next World Cup. That's where it falls down. Countries get a good side every so often but don't have the back-up. The United States have the best potential to be a major player but their public don't seem interested. They're within touching distance of the last four but most Americans probably wouldn't know what's going on. The coach Bruce Arena has done excellently and the players are very athletic. If they had a league comparable to those in South America or Europe, I think they'd really burst through and I wouldn't be entirely surprised if they ditched Germany today. In the two other games not involving England I go with Turkey to squeeze past Senegal and Spain to have a bit too much experience and know-how for Korea. If we are going to have a surprise finalist I think Turkey are the best bet and, after my wife drew them out for me in a sweepstake, that might not be bad."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
