Imported from New York, it is basically a disco-musical about Imelda Marcos, beautifully staged by Alex Timbers. But, while it makes a fine immersive spectacle, it left me craving more hard information about its subject. The big issue concerns the book; or rather, the lack of one. Like Evita, this is a show in which the songs alone are left to tell the story. And, to his credit, the multi-talented Byrne, whose concept this is, gives us a clear outline. We see Imelda\u2019s rise from small-town beauty to the most powerful political figure in the Philippines. She marries a rising young senator, Ferdinand Marcos, in 1954, helps him get elected president in 1965 and, after his illness, virtually runs the country. But the combination of martial law, top-level corruption and the murder of the opposition leader, Ninoy Aquino, lead eventually in 1986 to a popular revolution and the flight of the Marcoses to America. All this is told through beguiling songs and imaginative spectacle. But I found myself wanting to know more. We learn little about the US\u2019s dubious role in supporting Marcos during his 20 years in power, not a lot about how people learned to live under martial law, and even less about who was finally responsible for Aquino\u2019s murder. I know a musical is not a history lesson, but the lack of a libretto means we never fully understand how the Marcos regime survived as long as it did. The show\u2019s big idea, however, is to seize on the fact that Imelda converted one of her New York townhouses into a disco. So David Korins\u2019s design turns the Dorfman into a dance palace in which the standing spectators become eager participants. Seated above the action, I was fascinated by the kaleidoscopic ingenuity of the design, which makes use of rotating platforms, video projections and newsreel footage. The spectators, urged to engage in line-dancing, are seduced, like the Filipinos, by Imelda\u2019s charisma before being confronted with the ugly reality of power. We are even asked to engage in a climactic singalong of the catchy title-song. It is all momentarily exciting, and Natalie Mendoza gives a stunning performance as Imelda. She starts out as a simple girl in a print frock and visibly seems to harden as she becomes encased in ever more extravagant costumes with shoulderpads like aeroplane wings. Mendoza holds the show together and is well supported by Mark Bautista as her husband, Dean John-Wilson as the white-suited Aquino, and the best-looking ensemble I\u2019ve seen in years. Yet, for all the charm of the music and the vigour of Annie-B Parson\u2019s choreography, I came out feeling that such a subject craves more complex treatment. The show doesn\u2019t shy away from the repressiveness of the Marcos regime and deftly pulls the rug away from our initial surrender to Imelda\u2019s magnetism. But, in the end, that isn\u2019t quite enough. Byrne has come up with a clever idea, but I longed for a first-rate musical dramatist to add substance to the 90-minute spectacle. \u2022 Until 8 January. Box office: 020-7452 3000.
