An enthusiastic supporter, she asked if she could be the project's cleaner. The committee's response was to appoint her a part-time warden, and she visited elderly residents and led the children's before-school club. Joan was a socialist and member of the Labour party. Her home was always the election headquarters, with Joan delivering leaflets and knocking on doors. She was to serve her family, the party (although in old age she was disillusioned by New Labour) and the church for more than 50 years. Born in Sutton Venny in Wiltshire, she was raised by an aunt after the death of her mother. As a teenager, she worked in a children's home, married and was soon caring for her own family. Then her husband took a post abroad and stayed there. Left to bring up five children, Joan did a number of cleaning jobs before working with the Southdown project. A regular worshipper at the local Anglican church, she got on her knees both to pray and to clean the building. Her faith continued despite her struggles on a low income and the death, from cancer, of one of her daughters. She was particularly pleased when one of her sons became a full-time worker at the Southdown project. Not least, Joan was a good neighbour, always visiting the lonely. Once, when our house was burgled, Joan was soon there with cakes and cleaning gear. She never wanted to be in the limelight. She saw herself as one who served others. Her three sons and a daughter survive her."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
