If that appears harsh, the greatest golfer in a generation appeared perfectly at ease with that scenario himself. Until now. Woods\u2019s complex relationship with US galleries conjures gallows humour. A string of relationships, after all, were so damaging not only to Woods\u2019s personal life but his broader reputation. Woods, already deliberately distant from fellow competitors, was apparently forever tarnished as tales of his extra-marital antics emerged. Phil Mickelson, the immaculate blue-eyed boy and long-time Woods rival, benefited in popularity terms. The intervening years \u2013 now nine since the infamous Woods incident involving a fire hydrant \u2013 have seen moderate success, multiple surgeries and aborted comebacks following glimmers of promise. Woods\u2019s struggles were met with joy on the basis he deserved every ounce of turmoil. More striking therefore than Woods\u2019s performance in finishing 12th at the Honda Classic, an encouraging display in testing conditions after a fourth back operation, was the reaction towards him. At 42, Woods has surely never had such support. A press release hailing a 20,000 Honda Classic attendance rise from 2017 \u2013 225,000 visited this year \u2013 opened with the words: \u201cPropelled by the return of Tiger Woods \u2026\u201d The tournament\u2019s executive director, Kenneth Kennerly, added: \u201cThe energy level at the tournament was at an all-time high.\u201d He wasn\u2019t wrong. That Woods has gleaned inspiration from a group of younger professionals \u2013 Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas, Rickie Fowler et al \u2013 who took it upon themselves to keep their former idol in touch with the golf scene is well known. In the words of Jim Furyk, they have perhaps \u201cprodded the bear\u201d in respect of enhancing Woods\u2019s desire to win, and win consistently, again. Less visible until Honda week was the extent to which crowds, who had once been fascinated by Woods without any obvious willingness to warm to him, now pull so strongly in his direction. The numbers \u2013 to the tune of thousands \u2013 who followed Woods on Sunday gave at least the perception of 90% of those in attendance watching one group at the PGA Tour event. The shouts don\u2019t become any sharper \u2013 \u201cMake Sundays great again, Tiger\u201d was a particular low \u2013 but the sentiment is obvious; these spectators want Woods to win, to the point where golf is verging on tribal territory. At times, Woods almost looked bashful about it all. Woods, a Jupiter resident, offered a simple explanation. \u201cThis is where I live,\u201d he said after completion of round four. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this community for a long time now. I\u2019ve been a South Florida resident for a very long time. This is a hometown event for me. \u201cLA is where I grew up but I live here now, and these people recognise that. They see me around all the time. I\u2019m just part of the community here. I\u2019ve been here for a while.\u201d It does, however, seem a stretch to believe interaction at the local supermarket or ATM machine fuels vociferous backing for Woods. The explanation is multi-faceted. When Woods sunk to his lowest ebb, his bloated face beamed across the world after an arrest for driving under the influence last May, sympathy was suddenly widespread. Woods, who projected a sense of infallibility, had never been a recipient of such feeling. By the time he returned to the competitive fold, it felt like onlookers had decided this individual had suffered enough for his earlier indiscretions. There is also a sporting narrative. Just as a young breed of golf fans want to see what Tiger in his prime was really like, others rightly understand they could be bearing witness to arguably the finest sporting comeback story of all time should the 14-times major champion scale epic heights again. Golf doesn\u2019t need Tiger Woods but there can be no doubt \u2013 commercially, if nothing else \u2013 the sport takes on a fresh identity and claims broader interest when he is part of the picture. Rightly or wrongly, that hasn\u2019t actually altered in two decades. The attitude of Woods himself plays a part. He routinely states that being pain free is key to his smiling, more open nature at golf events but it has looked for some time that he recognised a need to drop some shackles in a bid to enter a fresh professional chapter. Woods is more engaging with the media, which draws rueful smiles from an older generation who well remember his terse and at times needlessly guarded approach. By Woods\u2019s own admission, his father was influential in that regard. Now, he displays a far more appealing side. Woods exited PGA National with chants from young fans ringing in his ears. Whatever else the remainder of this fascinating career entails, he has succeeded in winning round America\u2019s golfing public."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
