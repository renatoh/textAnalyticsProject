A win over Scotland on Saturday would see them finish in mid-table \u2013 hardly the goal when a treble of Championship titles offered itself before a ball was kicked in this campaign, but events overtook them fairly quickly. The combination of injuries and the retirement of Paul O\u2019Connell lowered their sights to a point where against Italy they needed to look creative. The win was almost unavoidable \u2013 the manner of it needed to be convincing, however. \u201cI heard Rory Best saying it was about giving the fans something back and putting in a performance,\u201d said Sean Cronin, the Ireland forward who won his 50th cap. \u201cThat was something we talked about during the week, not worrying about what\u2019s gone before but trying to put in a good performance today at home against an Italian team that caused us massive problems in the World Cup. \u201cThere was a big focus there: a massive thing for us was that we wanted to play to the best of our ability. There are areas we will have to work on and Joe was quick to tell us that after the match.\u201d The good news for Joe Schmidt, aside from the nine tries, was the prospect of reinforcements coming over the hill. Absentees Cian Healy, Eoin Reddan and Rob Kearney are all expected to be fit to face Scotland, who are lumbered with a six-day turnaround. That advantage was accentuated further by Ireland having an early kick-off against Italy, so they have every advantage going into the last round. The positive side effect of the injury toll was the arrival of new caps to the scene: three in Twickenham a fortnight ago and another against Italy, in the shape of replacement prop Finlay Bealham. His arrival into the game in the second half brought the Connacht contingent to five, a stat unforeseeable only a year ago. \u201cIf you told me that five of us would be playing a Six Nations game against Italy I don\u2019t know what I would have told you,\u201d Bealham said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t say too much at the end \u2013 we just all looked at each other and had a big smile. We were all thinking the same thing: really humbled and just really happy we were all there. Hopefully some more lads will come in in the future. \u201cPeople might be playing club rugby now and think that in a couple of years you could be playing for your country. It\u2019s just a matter of working hard and proving yourself and the rewards will come.\u201d By the time Bealham went on to the field the damage to Italy was done. A spectacular try by Jamie Heaslip \u2013 a contender for try of the season \u2013 just before the break finished any slim hopes the Italians had of competing. That left then 25-3 down, a predicament compounded by an intercept for Jared Payne in the first few minutes of the second half. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have to go up in certain areas next week, a couple of levels again,\u201d Cronin said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how Scotland get on but they\u2019re a quality side with a quality coaching team as well. We\u2019re not getting carried away with today. You have to put it into perspective and we put one over Scotland last year in the Six Nations and they will be gunning big time next week. It\u2019s all to play for, for them and us. We would like to go up in a couple of areas. \u201cIn the first three games, the draw against Wales was very disappointing when we were 13-0 up. France was one that seriously got away. We just wanted to focus on this game, not on stuff that went on in the previous rounds. We wanted to concentrate on ourselves and get a performance at home in front of our fans, and then build for next weekend.\u201d Ireland Zebo; Trimble, Payne (McFadden, 72), Henshaw, Earls; Sexton (Madigan, 50), Murray (Marmion, 60); McGrath (Bealham, 66), Best (capt; Cronin, 50), Ross (White, 55), Ryan, Toner (Dillane, 55), Stander (Ruddock, 62), Van der Flier, Heaslip.
