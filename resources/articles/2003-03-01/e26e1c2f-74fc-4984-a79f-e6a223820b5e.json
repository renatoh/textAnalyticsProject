Jackson, who in recent months had been working on an adaptation of William Golding's three-novel epic To The Ends of the Earth for the BBC, died at his mother's home in Devon yesterday. The 53-year-old wrote for the theatre, radio and film, as well as TV, but will be best remembered for Warriors, the 1999 BBC1 docudrama about the experiences of British soldiers serving with the UN peacekeeping operation in Bosnia in the early 90s. Warriors dealt with the harrowing true life topic of how - as a result of their UN role - British troops had to stand by helplessly while attrocities were carried out against Bosnian civilians. Jackson teamed up with director Peter Kosminsky for Warriors, which starred three then largely unknown actors: Matthew MacFadyen, Damien Lewis and Ioan Gruffyd. Warriors was a critical and ratings success and won numerous awards, including a Bafta and RTS award for best drama, and the Prix Italia. The BBC's controller of drama commissioning, Jane Tranter, who worked closely with Jackson on productions including Warriors and The Project, said he was \"one of our most accomplished and highly regarded television writers\". \"Leigh understood the essential nature of our human condition and was both moved and amused by it. He was fearless in his choice of subjects and unintimidated by complex characters or difficult emotions,\" Ms Tranter added. She added that the BBC is setting up a writer's bursary in Jackson's name \"to celebrate and commemorate his contribution to British television drama\". MacFadyen, with whom Jackson worked on Warriors and The Project, said he was \"heartbroken\" at his death. \"He wrote fabulous dialogue - very delicate and intuitive. He was always fighting with Kosminsky to take things out, pare things down,\" he added. \"As an actor you always felt free with his scripts, not constricted - he gave you space. He was a lovely, twinkly, funny, attentive man.\" Jackson began his scriptwriting career in the theatre, becoming a resident writer at London's Royal Court in the late 70s. Four theatre plays and eight radio scripts followed, before he moved into TV, becoming a script editor on Grange Hill in 1986. Jackson's TV work included an adaptation of Joanna Trollope's Other People's Children and Drowning in the Shallow End, both for the BBC. His final work was last autumn's The Project, another docudrama made in collaboration with Kosminsky. The Project told the story of a group of Labour supporters who worked for the party before its 1997 election victory and then grew increasingly disillusioned with how conservative its policies were after it came to power. Jackson again collaborated with Kosminsky on the drama, which turned into a gruelling three-year labour of script writing and rewriting. The Project had a mixed critical reaction and disappointing ratings, as well as drawing flak from new Labour for its alleged distortion of what really happened, but the BBC and Jackson remained proud of it. \"If it should prove to be the last thing I write, then it could not be better testimony to a life spent in sporadic usefulness,\" he wrote recently. Jackson was first diagnosed with cancer in 1997, around the time of his first meeting with Kosminsky to discuss Warriors. The cancer returned in 2001, while he was working on the script for The Project, but after an operation Jackson recovered and production went ahead. It returned again shortly before The Project was broadcast on BBC1 last autumn. His latest work, To The Ends Of The Earth, is expected to be screened by the BBC in 2005. Jackson is survived by his wife, from whom he was divorced, and two children."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
