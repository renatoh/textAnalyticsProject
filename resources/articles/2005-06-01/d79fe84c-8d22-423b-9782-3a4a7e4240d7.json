What of the principle of legality, of due process and of the integrity of the criminal justice process? We think these things are rather important, as does the court of appeal. Dr Naughton is also mistaken in thinking that innocence projects provide the answer. There are many such projects in the US and during a recent visit to talk about our work, they could scarcely believe that the government would set up such a system as the Criminal Cases Review Commission. We welcome any high-quality help that can be given to those who claim to be wrongly convicted and wish Dr Naughton's project every success.
