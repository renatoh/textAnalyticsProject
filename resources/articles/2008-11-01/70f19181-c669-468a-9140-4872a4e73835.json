But less noticed is the growing internecine battle for the soul of the Democratic party, a fight which could prove to be no less bloody in the coming weeks, months and years. Many of Barack Obama's most influential supporters in the blogosphere \u2013 the ones who, justifiably, believe they played an enormous role in helping to bring him to the dance \u2013 are growing none to happy with the direction for \"change\" being signalled by both him and, even more so, the Democratic leadership in Congress. Obama's transition appointments so far make his administration look a lot like Clinton v3.0. Despite predictably impotent cries from Republicans that Rahm Emmanuel's appointment as White House chief of staff signalled a wild \"liberal\" swing for the nascent Obama administration, those in the reality-based progressive blogosphere recognised it for what it was: a practical appointment, perhaps even a cynical one, to help Obama leverage opportunities from a potentially combative Congress. Emmanuel's record has proven to be anything but progressive, and certainly nothing that even resembles \"liberal\". And, from where I sit, Obama's votes in the Senate on everything from immunity for telecommunications companies, continual funding for misbegotten wars and even trillion dollar accountability-free bailouts made pretty damned clear that he was talking about change from the current administration, and not necessarily anything more than that. The newly revitalised Democratic majority in Congress shows few signs of changing its old ways, either. They have already squandered two years of leadership, giving the finger to those who put them in power, and otherwise correctly calculating that even the disappointed base would have nowhere else to turn this November. Now, as Democrats on Capitol Hill reorganise for the new session, battle lines between proactive progressives, Republican-lite Blue Dogs and the spineless Rest of Them (unfortunately, the leadership is largely made up of the Rest of the Them) is becoming more rancorous by the day. After Joe Lieberman spent the last year trashing his own party, supporting Republicans and becoming one of John McCain's most visible supporters, Democrats simply rolled over to allow him back into the fold and in charge of the same committees he poorly administered previously. \"They can rant and rage but they still do not put the fear into folks to actually change their votes,\" one Democratic aide told the Washington Post, about the progressive bloggers of the Netroots. In response, Jane Hamsher of the fiercely progressive Firedoglake shot back to her readers: \"This is about telling you that you mean nothing. ... No matter what Joe Lieberman does, the people who are protecting him hate you much more than they hate him.\" At Americablog, another hugely popular and aggressive supporter of the Democratic party throughout the election cycle, an angry John Aravosis responded by charging: Democrats have sent a clear message to all of you out there, to the entire blogosphere. ... You don't matter to these people. They don't fear you, so they don't care what you think. They need to either fear your ability to hurt them, or envy your ability to help them. The netroots has entered envy territory, but the fear factor is lacking. The Democratic party, the Democratic establishment, doesn't like you. They want you to go away. That is, until the next time they need you. Fellow Americablogger Joe Sudbay pointed his rage towards the ineffective House majority leader Steny Hoyer, who, he said used \"the coded language of the rightwing\" to announce \"that Democrats in Congress aren't really going to be Democrats\". Hoyer had signalled Democratic leadership intentions to once again not deliver the change that progressives continue to think they might someday get from the party. In a speech delivered at the National Press Club last week Hoyer declared obliviously: \"For the first time in decades, we are a true national majority party \u2013 and if we want to stay that way, we must govern like one.\" Sudbay's response: \"Hoyer, as usual, has it all wrong.\" \"If Democrats want to stay in power,\" he wrote, \"they need to enact the agenda of change for which people voted. The Democrats need to actually lead, something Democrats often seem incapable of doing. Instead, too many Democrats, like Hoyer, undermine the progressive agenda every step of the way.\" Aravosis, who correctly notes that progressives in the blogosphere \"are envied, but we're not feared\", threatened a line in the sand. \"The DC establishment, the politicians, the non-profits, the corporations and the PR firms, all know that no matter how much they ignore us and refuse to support us, no matter how deeply they betray us after we bust our asses for them, we will always be there for them the next time they come knocking on behalf of the progressive cause.\" \"I think that gravy train just stopped,\" warns Aravosis. But does he mean it? I've never known him to make idle threats. But the alternatives remain few, and revolutions don't come easy. \"The biggest obstacles to change will be Democrats like Hoyer who will undermine the agenda that the American people think they're getting from President Obama,\" as opposed to the currently-neutered Republicans, Sudbay wrote. The Lieberman affair proved again \"that Senate Democrats are spineless\", he said, before going on to conclude: \"The Democrats on Capitol Hill are going to be their own worst enemies.\" Perhaps. But I think it's more likely to be the progressives in the blogosphere who step up to take that title in the near future. At least I'll hope so. Who ultimately wins this civil war remains anyone's guess. But it's not gonna be pretty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
