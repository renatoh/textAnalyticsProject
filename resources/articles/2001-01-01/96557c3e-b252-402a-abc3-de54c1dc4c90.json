Caniggia, 33, had originally intended to play for the Dark Blues for six months but has changed his mind after settling well into life in Tayside and Scottish football since his arrival in October. He has become a favourite at Dens Park, after scoring five times since his debut at Aberdeen. \"I am delighted that Claudio has chosen to extend his stay at Dundee,\" said the Dundee chief executive Peter Marr. \"His commitment to the club over the last three months has been outstanding - both on and off the field. This extended contract not only shows the tremendous faith we have in him, I believe it shows the faith he has in us as a club and what we are trying to achieve.\" The Dundee player-manager Ivano Bonetti, who pushed for the initial Caniggia signing despite the widespread belief the Argentine would not come to Scotland, believes that credit should go to the club's hierarchy for sealing the deal. \"My thanks go to Peter and (chairman) Jimmy Marr for making this possibility a reality,\" Bonetti said. \"I am pleased for Claudio, the club, Dundee's fans and myself that Claudio will be staying with us.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
