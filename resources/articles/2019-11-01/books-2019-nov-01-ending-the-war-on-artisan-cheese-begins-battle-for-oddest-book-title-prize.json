Many previous winners of the Diagram prize, which has been running for 41 years, have involved a certain part of the human anatomy, such as 1993\u2019s winner American Bottom Archaeology, and Living With Crazy Buttocks, which took the award in 2002. Neither title is quite as it seems: the former relates to \u201cthe most ambitious archaeological undertaking to have been conducted in eastern North America since the WPA era\u201d; the latter is a collection of essays about contemporary culture. The most scatological title on this year\u2019s shortlist, Charles L Dobbins\u2019s self-published The Dirt Hole and Its Variations, is about the practice of trapping, complete with \u201cover 80 detailed photos to help you catch more fox, coyote, bobcat and raccoon\u201d. Dobbins\u2019s book is competing against Ending the War on Artisan Cheese by Catherine Donnelly; Hitler\u2019s Monsters: A Supernatural History of the Third Reich by Eric Kurlander; How to Drink Without Drinking by Fiona Beckett; Noah Gets Naked: Bible Stories They Didn\u2019t Teach You at Sunday School by Xanna Eve Chown; and Viking Encounters: Proceedings of the 18th Viking Congress, edited by Anne Pedersen and S\u00f8ren M Sindbaek. Tom Tivnan, the Bookseller\u2019s managing editor and prize coordinator, predicted the latter was a strong contender, despite its relatively ordinary title. \u201cLet us not rule out Viking Encounters, which delves into a consistent Diagram [feature], the academic conference, which harks back to the very first winner: 1978\u2019s Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Nude Mice,\u201d he said. The prize was dreamed up at the 1978 Frankfurt book fair, when Trevor Bounford and Bruce Robertson, co-founders ofthe Diagram Group graphics specialist, were trying to amuse themselves. Other previous winners include How to Avoid Huge Ships, The Joy of Waterboiling, and Greek Rural Postmen and Their Cancellation Numbers. This year\u2019s shortlist opens to a public vote on Friday, with the winner \u2013 who receives nothing for the honour, although their nominator is traditionally given a \u201cpassable\u201d bottle of claret \u2013 announced on 29 November. \u201cAs the Diagram prize enters its fifth decade, I am pleased to say that this is one of the best years yet for the prize, with a particularly strong shortlist,\u201d said the Bookseller\u2019s pseudonymous diarist Horace Bent. \u201cI am particularly pleased to see Ending the War on Artisan Cheese on the list, as I have seen what destruction the conflict has wrought: disfigured Hebridean Blues, pulverised Gubbeens and orphaned wheels of Cornish Kern,\u201d he said. Hitler\u2019s Monsters also intrigues; I am sure it is a very sober academic treatise on the subject, but on first scan it does seem to take much from the plots of the Hellboy comics and Raiders of the Lost Ark.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
