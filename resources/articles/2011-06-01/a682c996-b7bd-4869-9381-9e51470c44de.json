In fact, that title is hotly disputed, with contenders including Sister Rosetta Tharpe's Strange Things Happening Every Day (1944), and Roy Brown's Good Rockin' Tonight (1947). But the song that is usually recognised as the first true rock'n'roller is Rocket 88, recorded by Mississippi-born saxophonist/vocalist Jackie Brenston. A bawdy swing/blues concoction with a raunchy sax break, it hymned a particular model of Oldsmobile and threw sexual innuendo into the mix with lines such as \"Everybody likes my Rocket 88/Baby, we'll ride in style\". Where would a million future garage bands have been without it?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
