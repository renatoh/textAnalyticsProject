We will be a time-free zone where everyone can live their lives to the fullest \u2026 Our goal is to provide full flexibility, 24/7. If you want to cut the lawn at 4am, then you can do it.\u201d The islanders, whose main sources of income are tourism and fishing, are calling for formal opening hours to be abolished and people to be allowed to \u201cdo what we want, when we want\u201d \u2013 although children will still have to go to school, Hveding said. Sommar\u00f8y spends November to January in darkness, but in summer residents know that when the sun rises on 18 May, it will not set again until 26 July. \u201cIt\u2019s constant daylight,\u201d Hveding said on the campaign\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cIf you want to paint your house at 2am, it\u2019s OK. It we want to take a swim at 4am, we will.\u201d The residents added: \u201cHere we enjoy every minute of the midnight sun, and yes, a coffee with friends on the beach at 2am is a normal thing.\u201d Tourism officials told NRK they suspected the campaign was mainly a clever ploy to attract more summer visitors, but a philosophy professor has hailed it as an intriguing idea. \u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating concept,\u201d said Truls Egil Wyller of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. Society had been ruled by the clock \u201cand so disciplined in a very special way\u201d only for the past two centuries, he said. \u201cBefore that, you worked mostly as long as it was necessary, you ate food when you were hungry and you lay down when you were tired. In modern society, everything we do is controlled by the pace of the clock, from the moment we get up.\u201d He said though that residents of Sommar\u00f8y would not find life without time particularly easy. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s impossible to pull a whole island out of the global clock,\u201d he told the broadcaster. \u201cBut it does sounds very difficult.\u201d After a public meeting in May, the islanders last week handed the local MP, Kent Gudmundsen, a petition calling for the scheme to be debated in parliament. He told the iTroms\u00f8 newspaper it sounded exciting and suggested it could be considered as a third option alongside summer and winter time. Visitors to Sommar\u00f8y have reportedly embraced the idea enthusiastically, with some abandoning their watches and attaching them to a bridge leading to the island. But not all residents are so sure. \u201cI can foresee challenges with some guests when it comes to checking in and checking out, and the opening hours of the bar and restaurant,\u201d said Malin Nordheim, a receptionist at the Sommar\u00f8y Arctic hotel. \u201cI\u2019m a little sceptical.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
