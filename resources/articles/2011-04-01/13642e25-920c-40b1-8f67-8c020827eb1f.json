Morris and Berry join Jim Best as trainers whose high rate of non-runners is causing enough concern to the authority to merit an official warning. Non-runners can have a significant impact on betting turnover, which in turn can reduce the levy returned to racing from bookmakers. The rate of non-runners is a particular concern at some Flat tracks with well-known draw biases, such as Beverley and Chester. Analysis of the rate of non-runners from Best's yard showed that it was more than three times higher than the national average, while both Morris and Berry were double the average. Morris said: \"No one wants non-runners but it can be two and a half days from when you declare a horse until it runs and that can be a very long time in a horse's life.\" The self-certification process allows trainers to withdraw a horse from a race without the need for an examination by a vet. The BHA had considered withdrawing the right to self-certify non-runners from the trainers concerned, but this would first require a change to the rules. However, the authority has now made it clear to all three trainers that the necessary change will be made if their non-runner rate does not decline."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
