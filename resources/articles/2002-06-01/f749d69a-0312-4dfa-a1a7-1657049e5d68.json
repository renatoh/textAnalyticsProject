But now help could be at hand in the form of an experimental interactive drama that attempts to talk to children in their own language. L8r is an audio drama supported by an animated website, a chatroom and text messaging service. It is being piloted in schools and youth clubs in Liverpool, Bristol, Paignton and London. The story - by Malcolm Campbell of Byker Grove fame - follows six characters: a teenage couple who are expecting a baby; one of the couple's younger brother and his girlfriend who are thinking about having sex; and two friends of the younger couple, who are sexually active. Pupils can chat live with the characters over the net, search for extra clues on the website, send messages to the characters via the bulletin boards and receive text messages alerting them of up-and-coming live events on the site. But most crucially, pupils get to affect the storyline in each of the episodes by voting online. By taking an active role in the characters' decisions, it is hoped that the pupils will think more about consequence and effect in relationships of their own. \"It's all about making education more open,\" said Zoe Cook of the communications company, APT, behind the project. \"It's a more engaging way to teach the subject of teenage pregnancy because it is young people talking to young people.\" The Teenage Pregnancy Unit, a government backed body, commissioned the drama."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
