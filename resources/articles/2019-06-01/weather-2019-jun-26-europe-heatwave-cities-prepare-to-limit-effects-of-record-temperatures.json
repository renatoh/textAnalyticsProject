Authorities have warned that temperatures could pass 40C and reach 45C in parts of the continent by Saturday as a plume of hot air moves north from the Sahara, sucked northwards by a stalled storm over the Atlantic and high pressure in central Europe. In Germany, where the 38.6C recorded on Wednesday in Coschen, near the Polish border, exceeded the country\u2019s previous June high, officials imposed a 120km/h speed limit on stretches of the Saxony-Anhalt autobahn as the road surface began to deteriorate, while rail tracks buckled near Rostock on the Baltic Sea. In Brandenburg, police said they were \u201cspeechless\u201d as a man was stopped riding his moped naked, and after guards caused uproar in Munich by ordering a group of women to put their bikini tops back on, the city council was set to debate a by-law change to allow topless bathing. Schools in parts of France, meanwhile \u2013 where an all-time heat record of 44.1C could be beaten on Friday \u2013 were expected to remain closed until the end of the week, while authorities in Paris, Lyon, Strasbourg and Marseille banned older cars from entering their city centres to combat pollution. Regional \u00cele-de-France authorities estimated the measure would affect nearly 60% of vehicles circulating around the French capital, including delivery vans and trucks, and many cars older than 10 years, which have higher emissions than newer models. With temperatures in Milan forecast to hit 40C, charities were preparing to distribute 10,000 bottles of free water to the homeless and other people in need, while 33 of Spain\u2019s 50 provinces will be facing record-breaking temperatures, which could reach 44C. Innsbruck\u2019s famous \u201cfiaker\u201d carriage horses were taken off the streets as the city recorded 36.7C, breaking the 2012 record for Tyrol state of 36.6C. Three people, including two in their 70s, died in southern France after suffering heart attacks and other problems while swimming. French authorities have warned of the dangers of diving into cold water in very hot conditions, but there was no immediate confirmation the deaths were related to the heatwave. In Poland, the interior ministry said 90 people have drowned so far this month trying to cool off in lakes or rivers, and in Lithuania 27 people were reported to have died in similar circumstances as temperatures in the Baltic state soared above 35C. Strong winds and high temperatures helped fan a forest fire in Catalonia, in Spain, which destroyed some 2,500 hectares of land. Hundreds of firefighters and 14 water-dropping aircraft were battling the blaze on Wednesday night. Scientists have said Europe\u2019s 2019 heatwave, like last year\u2019s, was closely linked to the climate emergency and that such extreme weather events will be many times more likely over the coming decades."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
