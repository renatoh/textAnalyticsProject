It emerged at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona today that the satellite broadcaster is working with mobile music specialist Omnifone on the technology needed for the service. Any broadband user \u2013 not only the 2 million signed up to Sky's own broadband service \u2013 would be able to listen to as many tracks as they like either through their computer or their television. Users can also download and keep their favourite tracks which are free of so-called Digital Rights Management software to be played on any device. The broadcaster is also testing ways of tying in the service with its satellite and broadband packages to make them more attractive. But it wants to make the service available to anyone with a broadband connection. Sky announced its intention to enter the digital music market last July as it clinched a deal with Universal Music, home to artists including U2, Duffy and Amy Winehouse. Sky expects to launch the service in the spring. The deal is part of an industry move towards unlimited music services to combat the tide of illegal online music sharing. Industry body the IFPI reckons that illegal peer-to-peer file sharing and music piracy accounted for 95% of music downloads in 2008 with 40bn tracks downloaded illegally worldwide. In some European territories, peer-to-peer piracy accounts for as much as 50% of total traffic carried by ISPs and cable companies. The creation of legitimate services to replace this traffic comes as governments and regulators are getting tough with internet service providers about their customers' activities online. In his interim Digital Britain report communications minister Lord Carter called for the ISPs and music industry to work together on a solution to combat persistent illegal file sharers. UK-based Omnifone today announced a service which it thinks will help ISPs combat the problem of piracy by making it easy for them to provide unlimited download services. Omnifone already has deals with the major music labels and has the European rights to a catalogue of about 5m tracks. Its new service, called MusicStation Next Generation, allows ISPs to provide those tracks to their customers under their own brand names. The service can pipe music through set-top boxes as well as PCs and Mac computers. \"Tens of millions of European consumers are engaged in music piracy every day,\" said the Omnifone chief executive, Rob Lewis. \"Whilst government pressure is growing, we also need to deliver alternatives. With today's announcement, Omnifone is offering consumers something better than piracy.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
