An investigation", "bodyText": "There appears to be some truth to Kanye West\u2019s claim that he has met \u201call the tech guys\u201d. The Chicago hip-hop mogul this weekend declared he is $53m in debt and requested funding from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Google cofounder Larry Page. He then threw down this 70-character gauntlet: The Guardian wasn\u2019t able to determine the true nature of West\u2019s finances, but he does appear to have more than a few friends in Silicon Valley, based on public press accounts and interviews with several tech executives. He frequently shows up at Apple\u2019s southern California office, is friends with rap-obsessed venture capitalist Ben Horowitz, has reportedly dined with an Instagram founder, and has some sort of social relationship with Dropbox chief executive Drew Houston. The interactions go back at least half a decade. There\u2019s some context here. The entertainment industry and tech have long had a fascination with each other. For music titans such as West, Nas, MC Hammer and Justin Bieber, it\u2019s become a way to grow serious businessperson bona fides. For technologists, it\u2019s the ultimate revenge of the nerds. Some of West\u2019s early interactions with Silicon Valley were well-documented by Gawker\u2019s tech industry gossip site Valleywag. In 2012 and 2013, the producer and rapper began pitching his latest vision, Donda, to investors. It was presented as a sort of hip man\u2019s General Electric that would have its fingers in everything from fashion and publishing to \u201calternative energy sources\u201d and \u201chovercrafts\u201d. Perhaps trying to grease the levers of finance, West invited several tech thought leaders to his 2013 engagement party at San Francisco\u2019s AT&amp;T Park, home of the Giants. Horowitz, the cofounder of mega venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, was there, as was Dropbox\u2019s Houston. Another person present: Mahbod Moghadam, the controversial cofounder of Rap Genius, the Andreessen Horowitz-backed company that helps people understand rap lyrics. \u201cThey\u2019re tight. It\u2019s cute,\u201d Moghadam, who now works at Everipedia, said of Horowitz and West. Moghadam left Rap Genius in 2014 after comments he made about a mass shooting at the University of California Santa Barbara. \u201cIn their defense, I did do a lot of stupid things,\u201d he said. Dropbox and Andreessen Horowitz didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. It couldn\u2019t be learned what relationship, if any, West maintains with executives at some of the biggest Silicon Valley companies, such as Facebook, Twitter, Uber and Alphabet (the artists formerly known as Google), although he has dined with Kevin Systrom, the cofounder of Facebook-owned Instagram. But he does appear to have a working relationship with Apple, a less-than-surprising development given the iPhone maker\u2019s work with streaming music these days \u2013 even if he did declare his new album The Life of Pablo would \u201cnever never never\u201d be on Apple\u2019s iTunes Store and would be exclusive to the streaming service Tidal. At Apple\u2019s southern California headquarters, where former record executive Jimmy Iovine helps run Apple music, West is sometimes found hanging out in Iovine\u2019s office, a person familiar with the meetings said. In his Twitter posts on 14 February, West asked Zuckerberg for $1bn to help handle his debts and bring Donda, his startup idea, to fruition. As Aaron Levie, the chief executive of Box, noted on Twitter, that\u2019s a lot of money these days, even in Silicon Valley."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
