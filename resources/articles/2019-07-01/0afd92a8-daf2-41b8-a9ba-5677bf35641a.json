They will be joined by David Walliams and Paul Whitehouse, and the role of Sophie will be taken by seven-year-old Clara Ross, who will make her TV debut. The special will be made by the team behind previous festive shows We\u2019re Going on a Bear Hunt and The Snowman and the Snowdog. The book tells the tale of the eponymous big cat who shows up at Sophie\u2019s front door and proceeds to eat the family out of house and home, even going so far as to drink all of the water out of the taps, before declaring: \u201cThank you for my nice tea. I think I\u2019d better go now,\u201d and departing. Oyelowo, who starred as Martin Luther King in Selma, said: \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t jump at the chance to play the iconic Tiger from The Tiger Who Came to Tea? He\u2019s a big cat of few words because he\u2019s too busy eating! But I relished all of the growling, chomping and slurping, which called on me to find my inner cat.\u201d Walliams, who will narrate the film, said: \u201cI knew Judith well and I really adored her. She was an incredible inspiration \u2013 her work is so brilliant. The book is a thing of beauty \u2013 there isn\u2019t a word out of place, the illustrations are just gorgeous. \u201cI really wanted to be a part of it and I was chuffed that she wanted me to narrate. I\u2019m so proud to be associated with it because it\u2019s a stone cold classic. Just like the book has been around for over 50 years, hopefully the animation will have this incredible longevity too.\u201d The book, which came out in 1968 and has sold more than 5m copies, was written and illustrated by Kerr, who died this year at the age of 95. It has often been suggested that it was influenced by her family\u2019s persecution by the Nazis in 1930s Germany, although Kerr denied this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
