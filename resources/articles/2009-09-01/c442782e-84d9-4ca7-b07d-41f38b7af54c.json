However, in a career with plenty of ups, the downs have come almost as thick and fast: England and Leicester coaches have at some time or other lost patience \u2013 his time in Martin Johnson's elite squad lasted as long as it takes the wing to score a try \u2013 and for one of the fastest men in world rugby, five caps in four years is paltry. Clearly making judgments is difficult but, after a summer move from Leicester to Wasps, Varndell says he's never been happier. \"Even at my best I was never scoring two tries every game,\" said Varndell after helping Wasps to the top of the table on Saturday night. After a season in which he felt sidelined and his career had stalled he says he has fallen on his fast feet with Wasps. \"Last season I don't think anyone spoke to me, but at Wasps we're always talking, trying things and it gives you confidence.\" He showed that with two tries on the opening day against Harlequins and with two more here in the first half. For the first Joe Simpson went 50 metres from a tap penalty before David Lemi and Danny Cipriani worked Varndell free on the left. For the second Simpson broke from the base of a scrum under his own post, went 60 metres with only Varndell able to keep pace. All that remained was for the wing to side-step what remained of Bath's cover \u2013 the full-back Joe Maddock \u2013 and, after Lemi had scored another try, dummying his way 30 metres down the left, Wasps looked home dry by half-time. Varndell's new director of rugby, Tony Hanks, was even prepared to overlook one of the flakier aspects of his winger's play and an error which set Wasps' nerves jangling. \"He's fast, he's powerful and he scores tries,\" said Hanks when asked about the Varndell's fumbled interception of a seemingly harmlessly ball heading for touch. From 17-10 up, Wasps were under the cosh for almost 30 minutes as Tim Payne received two yellow cards. \"Four tries in two weeks isn't at all bad,\" said Hanks, the man who, after buying both Lemi and Varndell, clearly has a nose for a summer bargain.
