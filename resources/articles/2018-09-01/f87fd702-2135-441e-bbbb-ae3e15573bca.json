Earlier that morning, Che Abdul Karim and his soon-to-be child bride had travelled over the border from Malaysia into the Thai province of Narathiwat for the wedding. After a short ceremony at 11am and a trip to the Islamic Council offices to get their marriage certificate stamped, the couple crossed back over the border. Ayu was now Che Abdul Karim\u2019s third wife. In Malaysia, where men can legally marry girls under 18 if they get Islamic sharia court approval, Ayu\u2019s case caused a national outcry in parliament and protests on the streets. But over the border in Thailand, where the controversial union took place, the response by the government and religious authorities has been notably muted. Hashim Yusoff, the imam who married the couple, defended the arrangement: Ayu (not her real name) was \u201cmature\u201d he said, so the marriage was sah (legal under sharia law). The imam did make Che Abdul Karim \u2013 himself an imam in a rural village \u2013 pledge not to have sexual relations with his young wife, but medical tests since are said to show that the 41-year-old did not keep his promise. Ayu\u2019s father, Madroseh Romadsa, who was present at the wedding to give consent, said simply: \u201cWe have never done anything wrong. In Thailand, many people get married at early ages.\u201d Since 2003, under Thailand\u2019s strict child protection laws, no one under 17 can marry, and sex with a minor is a prosecutable offence. However, in the southern provinces of Thailand \u2013 Narathiwat, Pattani and Yalla, which are majority Muslim \u2013 a legal loophole allows Muslim communities to apply Islamic law to family matters. According to this law, there is no minimum age for marriage and, culturally, girls are deemed eligible as soon as they start menstruating. In this way, child marriage has continued as an unregulated norm and a solution to underage pregnancy and rape \u2013 with the Thai government appearing to turn a blind eye. \u201cHere, if a girl is not married by the time she is 16, it is already felt to be too late and that no one will want to marry her,\u201d said Amal Lateh, who lives in Thailand\u2019s Pattani province and was forced at 15 to marry a relative 10 years her senior. The legal loophole has also created what Thai children\u2019s rights activist Anchana Heemmina described as the \u201cbig business of cross-border marriage\u201d \u2013 Malaysian men crossing into southern Thailand to easily engage in underage or polygamous marriages for which getting approval in Malaysia would be impossible or a very lengthy process. Mohammad Lazim runs one such business, helping arrange cross-border marriages for Malaysian men. He works with more than 50 bridegrooms a year, mainly wanting a second or third wife \u2013 but insists never with underage brides. He says that his business is tiny compared with some. \u201cPeople come from all over Malaysia to do this,\u201d he said. \u201cBusiness is booming: instead of applying to a sharia court in Malaysia and answering all their difficult questions \u2013 a process that takes sometimes a year \u2013 the shortcut is to come to Thailand. Here there is no law.\u201d The practice is also particularly lucrative for imams practising on the Thai side of the Golok river, who charge four times as much to conduct a marriage for a visiting Malaysian as they do for people from their own community. In Malaysia, Che Abdul Karim would have found it difficult or impossible to obtain permission to marry Ayu; in Thailand, he simply paid the imam 4,500 baht (\u00a3105), and it was done. He has since been fined 1,800 Ringgit (\u00a3340) in a sharia court in Malaysia after pleading guilty to polygamy and conducting the marriage without the court\u2019s permission. Wannakanok Pohitaedaoh was forced into a violent marriage when young and now runs Luk Riang, a children\u2019s shelter in Narathiwat. She said: \u201cThe biggest problem with child marriage in Thailand is that nobody wants to talk about it \u2013 not the Islamic Council, not the imams and not the government. It has always been swept under the rug, and that\u2019s where they want it to stay.\u201d Her opposition is deeply personal. Wannakanok, now 34, was just 13 when she was forced into marriage by her parents and says the experience \u201chaunts my soul to this day\u201d. \u201cWhen he asked me to have sexual intercourse, I wasn\u2019t ready for it. I didn\u2019t even know really what that meant, so I refused, and then he raped me,\u201d she said, sobbing at the memory. \u201cHe was very violent and every time he wanted to have intercourse, he would use violence. We were living at home, and my parents would hear me screaming. \u201cAnd it was the same for so many of my friends. Many of my friends who were 12 or 13 had been married to men who were a lot older than them, maybe in their 30s or 40s. But the girls were young like me and didn\u2019t want sex, so violence was very common. We had no idea about sex at that age.\u201d Most of her friends were pregnant by 14. She still regularly hears similar cases to hers and Ayu\u2019s. One 13-year-old girl, Naa, had recently been staying at the Luk Riang shelter while her mother worked in Malaysia. \u201cHer mother came to pick her up but soon after they married her to a 40-year-old as his second wife,\u201d said Wannakanok. \u201cThe family was very poor so she was a financial burden: it was easier to marry her off.\u201d There are no official figures on child marriages in Thailand but data from the human rights commissioner of Thailand shows that, in 2016 alone, in the public hospitals of Narathiwat, 1,100 married teenage girls gave birth. This does not include the three other provinces where child marriage is condoned, or births in private clinics and at home. But the Thai government appears reluctant to engage with the problem at a senior level, pushing responsibility back to the provincial Islamic councils. \u201cThis issue has never been raised in the Thai parliament,\u201d said Heemmina. \u201cThe government want to pretend it\u2019s not happening because they don\u2019t want to provoke the communities. They are protecting themselves.\u201d Their reluctance, she added, is rooted in sensitivity over self-determination for Islamic communities in the deep south of Thailand. For 14 years, a civil war has been raging in Narathiwat, Pattani, Yalla and occasionally southern areas of Songkhla. Its roots lie in Thailand\u2019s annexation and conquest in 1909 of the Malay sultanate of Patani, which covered most of these provinces. A separatist movement formed in the 1950s exploded into all-out insurgency in 2004. Though the conflict has quietened in recent years, bombings and shootings are still common, and the fighting has cost almost 7,000 lives, 90% of them civilians. As a result, policies imposed on the south from Bangkok are often a great cause of friction. The Thai government, which has thousands of troops stationed across the south, has little interest in stirring up tensions further by interfering in an issue deemed religiously sensitive. Suraporn Prommul, governor of Narathiwat province, said he had recently met with the Islamic Council over the issue. However, the only change Ayu\u2019s case had prompted was an agreement that in future \u2013 in cases involving a young bride and a foreigner \u2013 the couple must go first to the provincial Islamic Council office to get married, so the committee can look closely into the case.\u201d There was no stipulation on how this would be enforced. After the furore in Malaysia over Ayu\u2019s marriage, the girl and her family have this month returned to their native Thailand. Child rights activists fear the Thai government\u2019s apathy over the issue means Che Abdul Karim, who remains in Malaysia, will never be charged with child grooming and abuse. \u201cI am scared this will be another case of child marriage legitimising paedophilia that is swept under the carpet,\u201d said Heemmina. The impact on girls of marrying before the age of 18 is globally accepted as causing lasting emotional and physical damage, but also perpetuating the cycle of poverty. Girls in the southern Thai provinces are commonly taken out of school once they are married. Many find themselves divorced and with a child before they are even 18. But Safei Cheklah, the president of the Islamic Council of Narathiwat, while emphasising that council \u201cguidelines\u201d advise that under-18s should not be married, and admitting that it is \u201cnot suitable\u201d \u2013 still vehemently defended the practice: \u201cI have to speak based on Islamic principle, and according to Islam, the father can give permission for the girl to get married as long as she has achieved physical maturity.\u201d For the secretary of the Islamic Council, Abdul Razak Ali, whose own mother was just 13 when she married his 70-year-old father, allowing under-18s to marry was justified as a way to prevent \u201chideous\u201d cases of adultery or illegitimacy. This also extended to forcing underage girls who are raped to marry their rapists. Angkhana Neelapaijit, the human rights commissioner of Thailand, recounted a recent case of a 15-year-old who was raped in her village in the Yalla province. The girl was taken to a shelter but two days later the Islamic Council visited the girl to try to force her to marry her rapist. \u201cThey said it would be best for her,\u201d said Angkhana. Even charities seem wary of taking action. Aiyub Chena, vice-president of Nusantara, an Islamic NGO working with deprived children in southern Thailand, defended child marriage, because it protects girls from being stigmatised if they are caught with a man. \u201cAdultery is wrong and sinful according to Islam but if they banned child marriage, I am worried that would make adultery acceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can change the law but that won\u2019t change the society here. It will mean unmarried girls who get pregnant will be outcasts, and their children will not be accepted because they are illegitimate.\u201d Yet across the Islamic world there is a movement towards outlawing child marriage. Algeria, Oman, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Egypt, Morocco and Turkey have all set the minimum age for marriage at 18, and recently Indonesia prepared a presidential decree to close the legal loopholes that allow child marriage. In a small village in Pattani\u2019s Sai Buri district, women spoke about how common forced underage marriage still is in southern Thailand. They described figures known as \u201cfacilitators\u201d who would come to the village on behalf of men who are looking for a young wife. Amal Lateh, who was forced into marriage at 15, said: \u201cWhen the facilitators come to the houses, they don\u2019t ask the fathers directly \u2013 they will say things like, \u2018Do you have any lambs or baby goats you are selling?\u2019 Everyone understands what that means: it means they are looking for a virgin to marry. And then an arrangement will be made between the girl\u2019s father and the facilitator. The girl has no say.\u201d Suranya Litae was 15 when she was forced by her father to marry a man 16 years her senior in order to help her family out financially. She spoke of her anger that the law did not protect girls from the trauma of underage marriage. \u201cI did not want to be married. I cried so much, and I wanted so much to run away,\u201d she said. \u201cBut my family needed the money from my dowry to build a house. At that time I felt so sad because getting married meant I had to abandon my studies. Sadly, Suranya, stroked the head of her seven-year-old son, Afdon. \u201cI dreamed of being teacher,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that didn\u2019t come true.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
