England face Montenegro at Wembley on Thursday in their 1,000th fixture knowing that a draw guarantees qualification for Euro 2020 with a game to spare. A host of former players and managers will be in attendance to mark the occasion, with England\u2019s current players set to wear their \u201clegacy\u201d number \u2013 a chronological record of their first cap similar to those used by England\u2019s Test cricket team\u2013 on their shirts as part of the celebrations. Several members of the 1966 World Cup-winning team will also be at Wembley and Southgate has admitted that the solitary success of Sir Alf Ramsey\u2019s side more than half a century ago should provide an incentive for future generations to attempt to emulate. \u201cI suppose at the moment the win in the World Cup is the outlier whereas, in actual fact, historically, we looked at it as the benchmark,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a small island and the fact that even in rugby and cricket we\u2019ve had a brilliant run. The rugby team \u2013 huge credit to them. And they\u2019ve only managed to win once and, with respect, there are fewer countries that are capable of winning. \u201cSo, it\u2019s hard to win and that\u2019s got to be our aim. We\u2019ve got to now raise the bar for the next decades to make sure they are more successful than the previous ones. But we can\u2019t have that arrogance that maybe we\u2019ve had over the years that we have a right to be in those latter stages \u2013 we have to earn it. As a team and as a group of staff, we have to earn it.\u201d As well as the remaining members of the 1966 team, every former England captain and those players with 50 or more caps have all been invited to Wembley for the match. Leicester\u2019s James Maddison and Fikayo Tomori of Chelsea are in contention to become the 1,245th player to represent the senior men\u2019s team should they be selected by Southgate, who himself was player number 1,071. \u201cWhen we went to the National Football Museum last week, I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect going there but when you walk around it and see the history that you\u2019ve been involved in, and you have an understanding that we\u2019re talking over 100 years now \u2026\u201d he said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s still only 1,200 players who have ever had the chance to do it. I think 20 managers, probably less. So as a kid, all I wanted to do was play for England. That was coming home from school and watching them play in \u201882 in the World Cup. \u201cWhenever I played I was always thinking beforehand: 56 million people or whatever it was in the country, you\u2019re one of 11 standing there belting out the national anthem. What that meant to my family, to the school I went to, to the Sunday teams I played for, coaches I\u2019ve worked with. So, you couldn\u2019t be prouder, I thought, until you lead. And then you realise there\u2019s an even more, I don\u2019t want to say select group, but an even smaller group of people who have had that opportunity and that is an immense privilege.\u201d Southgate demurred when he was asked to name the best 11 players he played alongside for England, although he did admit relief not to be confronted by the selection dilemmas his predecessors faced. \u201cNot a chance, not a chance,\u201d he said when asked to name an XI of his teammates. \u201cMost of them would get into the team we\u2019ve got now, that\u2019s for certain. \u201cThese are the debates that you don\u2019t want to get involved in. I\u2019ve played with some of the greats of the last 25 years. If you looked at Beckham, Scholes, Gerrard, Lampard, Rooney, Gazza, it was hard enough to get four into a midfield that time, wasn\u2019t it, without going through the other generations of players. It was a privilege to play with some outstanding players.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
