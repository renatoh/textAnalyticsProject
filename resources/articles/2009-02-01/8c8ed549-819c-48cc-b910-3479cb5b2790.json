Taking responsibility is something I've always done as a captain and a manager. I've done it all through my career. I don't have an issue with it, it's what I'm paid to do.\" Southgate also believes it is his job to deflect stress from his players. \"No one else here needs take the pressure off me,\" he insisted. \"It's down to me to carry any pressure because the players need to be free to go out and play.\" Highly unlikely to be sacked by his chairman, Steve Gibson, the manager has not only diagnosed Boro's ills but prescribed a cure. \"I know exactly the qualities we need to get out of this situation,\" said the man appointed as Steve McClaren's successor at The Riverside. \"You need the old fashioned virtues of hard work and sticking together, along with a belief in playing football and creating chances.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
