A little later, I spotted a man in a white one-piece suit. He would have been perfectly camouflaged on the wide and deserted piste, but for a silver helmet that flashed in the sunlight. And then down came a skier in a purple one-piece, decorated with segments of fluorescent pink, mauve and lime green - a combination so violent that it stung the back of my eyeballs. The resort of Lake Louise in the Canadian Rockies had designated the last few days of April 'Eighties Week', and judging by some of the outfits on the slopes, visitors were throwing themselves into the spirit of the event. 'Believe it or not,' said my instructor, Dave Frick, 'I don't think they are here for Eighties week. That's happening on another part of the mountain. Those guys probably always dress like that. There are a lot of skiers around who don't know that the Eighties ever ended.' I cringed as I remembered the first piece of ski clothing I'd owned: a one-piece in purple by Nevica, rather like the one I had just seen. I had bought it in the early Eighties, but had continued to wear it for half the following decade - even though the combination of colours made my stomach churn every time I put it on in the morning. This week, however, seemed to be an attempt to evoke in skiers a nostalgia for all the excesses and tastelessness that the Eighties brought. Posters advertised a karaoke session, to be held in a bar beside the piste; a game of snow-beach volleyball; even a dating game for skiers. The latter, I had been told, was a spin-off from an event Lake Louise had held the previous season. As skiers rode up one of the chairlifts, they filled in personality questionnaires. That evening, matchmakers paired them up at a cocktail party. According to the organisers, that night saw five spontaneous bookings of double rooms at the Chateau Lake Louise, which was offering a special rate for participants. And why all this entertainment laid on now, so late in the season? After all, it was more than a week after Easter; a time when European skiers wouldn't dream of risking a holiday in the Alps. Yet here all the pistes still had a 100 per cent covering of snow. And that's the point: the season is exceptionally long here, yet few skiers take advantage of it - I seemed to have most of the mountain to myself. Many British skiers are probably unaware that you can ski this late. Look in the brochures of the big ski operators, and the last holiday is probably the second week of April. But that's because they stop flying the charters at that point, if they think demand is insufficient. Yet at Lake Louise, the season continues for a whole month longer - until mid-May. Even late in the season the resorts here can receive massive dumps of snow. At Dave's wedding the previous season - held in the day lodge at the foot of the slopes - a storm dropped 75cm of snow. Many of the guests couldn't fly home the next day - and that was at the very end of April. At one of the other ski areas that shares the regional 'Big 3' pass - Sunshine, a 40km-drive away - nearly 10 metres of snow fall every season, and they boast of the fact that they have no snowmaking facilities. Yet they don't close until the last weekend of May, less than four weeks before midsummer. At Lake Louise, meanwhile, the snow is so sure that the resort regularly hosts the first women's and men's races of the World Cup circuit, starting at the end of November. More striking than the general emptiness of the slopes is the scenery itself, for Lake Louise is routinely voted the most scenic resort in North America. That's nothing to do with anything man-made: most of the accommodation is in the valley floor, unceremoniously scattered around a glorified crossroads. What makes your jaw drop is the view from the pistes. They are spread over four different mountain faces - some 113 trails in all, plus some huge back bowls, making this the largest single ski area in the country - served by a dozen lifts, covering a vertical drop of just under 1,000 metres. Many of the slopes overlook the broad Bow Valley, so thickly covered with pines that as you look way up the valley the forest looks as fine as fur. On the far side of the valley rises a row of 3,000m peaks, with sheer cliff walls that look as though they were cut with a knife, topped with glaciers. Just below, you can make out the frozen lake that gave the resort its name. You can't help feeling that beyond the resort, sparsely scattered with skiers, stretches a wilderness that is virtually human-free. For Lake Louise stands within a national park created in 1885, the third oldest in the world. Banff National Park - which alone has more than 1,000 glaciers - is one of four adjoining parks that together protect more than 13,000 square kilometres of Rocky Mountain scenery. And yet because Banff National Park receives four times more visitors in summer than winter, ski season is low season, making for excellent deals on accommodation. The resort's flagship hotel - the Chateau Lake Louise, on the shores of the lake - didn't even bother opening in winter until the Eighties. As a result, the resort attracts people who appreciate wilderness. Jose Reineking, sales and marketing co-ordinator at the ski area, originally came from Holland. She swapped a small, flat, old and crowded homeland for a life in a vast, craggy, young new country - with a population density more than 100 times lower. 'Back home people are easy-going, tolerant, everyone does their own thing, but perhaps they have to because it's so crowded,' she said. 'Here, if I want to, I go off after work cross-country skiing for an hour and won't see anyone. But then when you do see people, they are really friendly - people really are pleased to meet.' There's a dilemma, though: people come to the mountains for a sense of wilderness; the national park is there to protect the landscape; but as a business, the resort needs to keep attracting skiers. Hence the special events, aiming to pull in skiers in low season. Like the event I'm heading to now: the dating game. Perhaps I'll meet a local ski bum, I wonder, or a lumberjackette, and who knows, soon I could be in love and making my home in the Rocky Mountains? At the Kokanee Cabin, where they are hosting the event, the barmaid breaks the bad news. No one has showed up, she says, so the game is cancelled. Here we go again, I think: sometimes this place is too empty for its own good. I let out a sigh - but not for long. There's a huge mountain out there waiting to be skied: and once again, I've got virtually the whole lot to myself. Can't complain about that.
