Still, while it\u2019s not precisely clear what Taylor meant, it appears he was trying to say that the elation of reaching the top flight of English football was worth the pain of probable immediate relegation (at least, for Watford at that time). There is a similar mentality in the City, which we will be reminded of this week with the quarterly reshuffle of the FTSE 100, the Square Mile\u2019s version of the Premier League. That mentality is: let\u2019s go for broke to get into the top flight and, once we\u2019re there, hope there\u2019s a weaker outfit that keeps us out of the drop zone. But, just like Watford 19 years ago, businesses often discover that it doesn\u2019t work out like that, which is why there are yo-yo FTSE firms just as much as there are football clubs. Oil services firm John Wood Group has been promoted to the FTSE 100 four times \u2013 and relegated four times \u2013 over the past 11 years, while sugar group Tate &amp; Lyle performed the same feat between 2004 and 2014. Hikma Pharmaceuticals is well placed to make those two appear sluggish: it has had four promotions to the FTSE 100, and three relegations, since 2015. Anyway, this time it looks like the budget airline easyJet is best placed to be cracking open the bubbly, while insurer Hiscox \u2013 promoted to the FTSE 100 a year ago at the expense of a new yo-yo stock, Just Eat \u2013 looks at risk of the drop. EasyJet was promoted to the FTSE 100 in 2013, but relegated in the summer of 2019, and even if it returns to the big time this week, not everyone is convinced the airline will hang on again for long. Commenting on easyJet\u2019s well-received full-year results this month, Hargreaves Lansdown wrote: \u201cWe don\u2019t think the group is out of the woods yet. Uncertainties linger around the implications of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, and customer sentiment remains weak. To make progress, easyJet will need to show it can start delivering again on cost control. Additionally, environmental concerns and regulations may prove a substantial threat to cheap air travel in the near future. EasyJet thinks it can offset its emissions for just \u00a325m a year as an interim measure, but this looks improbably cheap to us.\u201d On top of that, it is technically quite tricky to keep your share price rising once you\u2019ve been promoted. A study by Smith\u2019s Corporate Advisory last year found that shares in companies promoted to the FTSE 100 had risen on average by more than 15% in the two months leading up to reshuffle day, and then another 2% in the period between the announcement and the change. But during the first two months as a FTSE 100 firm, the shares dropped by an average of 5%. The good news for easyJet bosses is that FTSE rules have inbuilt protections to prevent too much churn. For a FTSE 250 business, you need to have become the 90th most valuable listed business (or better) in order to be promoted to the big league. Conversely, existing FTSE 100 businesses have to drop to 111th (or worse) in order to slip through the relegation trapdoor. All of which means two things: one, the FTSE 100 is very rarely a list of the UK\u2019s 100 most valuable listed firms; and two, the rules governing these movements are slightly more convoluted that a Taylor team talk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
