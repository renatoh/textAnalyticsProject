A survey of over 300 financial directors - undertaken by the recruitment firm Reed Personnel Services and the weekly accountancy newspaper Accountancy Age - posed the question \"Should the government tax graduates more?\" Graduate tax is one of the options being considered as part of the government's review of higher education. Alternatives include top-up fees and a deferred loan repayment scheme. Seventy-four per cent of respondents to the survey disagreed with the proposal by the education secretary, Charles Clarke, with many suggesting that it would worsen the state of higher education. Nick Watkins, the finance director of Contisteel, said: \"I cannot see the point of this. It is 'robbing Peter to pay Paul' and will create a further tax administration burden,\" he said. One director suggested that a graduate tax would lead to huge increases in drop-out rates among students - currently as high as 45% in some universities, while another suggested that such a scheme would deter large numbers of students from applying to university in the first place. Nineteen per cent of respondents thought the government should tax graduates more, although many thought the increase in tax should be linked to earnings or income. Bruce Coulter, the finance director of Albany International, said: \"Graduates should pay based on the degree they undertake, when their income reaches a certain level.\" Richard Post, head of Reed's accountancy wing, said: \"There is obviously strong feeling among UK finance directors over the issue of a graduate tax. Their concerns over the effect of the tax, and the practicalities of implementation, will make an interesting comparison with government plans due to be unveiled later this month.\" The government white paper on higher education funding will be published next week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
