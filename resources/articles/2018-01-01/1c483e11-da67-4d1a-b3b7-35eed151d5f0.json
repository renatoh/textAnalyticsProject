They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author, who knowingly writes false information. The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election!\u201d Wolff\u2019s book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, exploded into the public consciousness last week. The Guardian was first to publish excerpts, concerning former Trump adviser Steve Bannon\u2019s view of a Trump Tower meeting between aides and a group of Russians in the midst of the presidential campaign. Embarrassing details of White House life were published by other media outlets, leading to a renewed focus on Trump\u2019s mental state and capacity for his job. Trump sought to prevent publisher Henry Holt &amp; Co from releasing the book, only for his legal threat to prompt publication to be brought forward. The book shot to the top of bestseller lists worldwide. Trump has attacked Wolff and his work before. On Saturday, the president did not immediately specify which information in Wolff\u2019s book he claimed to be false. The White House has said the book is \u201cfiction\u201d and questioned Wolff\u2019s bona fides and access to the president himself. Wolff has said he conducted more than 200 interviews and stands by all his sourcing and reporting. News outlets have pointed to inconsistencies in Fire and Fury and in past work. Bannon, a key source for Wolff, speculates in the book that Trump himself may have met the lawyer and other Russians who met key aides at Trump Tower in June 2016 after suggesting they had incriminating material on Hillary Clinton. Bannon issued a statement last weekend in which he said his comments about the meeting being \u201ctreasonous\u201d, \u201cunpatriotic\u201d and \u201cbad shit\u201d had not been aimed at Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr, but at then campaign manager Paul Manafort, one of four Trump aides to have been indicted under special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian election meddling. He did not mention Trump\u2019s son in law, Jared Kushner, who also attended the meeting. Nor did Bannon retract his view of the character or advisibility of the gathering. Wolff\u2019s book also contains details of the drafting of a misleading statement about the meeting, at the direction of Trump and onboard Air Force One. Bannon has been disowned by the president and key Republican donors. He lost his job at the far-right Breitbart News website. The president\u2019s tweet on Saturday followed a relatively quiet day, in which the White House said he had been briefed in depth about issues relating to China."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
