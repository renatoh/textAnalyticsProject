In an interim report published yesterday, the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) said high-level alarms at BP's Texas City plant did eventually sound but only after the explosions had begun. \"Had the alarms sounded properly as the blowdown drum was flooding, it could have alerted operators to the emergency situation,\" said the board which investigates industrial accidents but does not issue penalties. The CSB is continuing its inquiry into the explosion at the nation's fourth largest refinery and has requested maintenance records for the alarms and related equipment. BP said last night that the findings of the board were in line with its preliminary findings published on May 17. \"We are not surprised by anything in the CSB report. It's consistent with our own report,\" said a spokesman. BP said that it was checking the maintenance records of the alarm equipment but was also concerned to see whether the alarms were affected by problems in a crucial piece of oil processing equipment. BP said last month that its own employees overfilled and overheated a key piece of refining plant. It fired staff and disciplined others after admitting \"deeply disturbing\" internal mistakes led to the blast. Last week lawyers said BP had negotiated \"extremely big\" settlements with families of workers killed in the March 23 explosion. The oil company said that talks with families and victims of the blast were under way, but declined to be specific about discussions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
