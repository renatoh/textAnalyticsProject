Given that the Iraq war is proving a bit of a touchy subject - witness the lukewarm reception for Bush's surge speech earlier this month - it's hardly surprising that this time round he chose to stay closer to home. Still, Bush's play-it-safe focus on domestic issues - a new healthcare plan, substantive immigration reform, and a big cut in oil consumption - left some observers questioning the speech's relevance. \"The laundry list of domestic initiatives that Bush rattled off may or may not be good ideas ... But the fact is that the bills that pass Congress this term won't be Bush's,\" writes the American Spectator's John Tabin. \"The best he can hope for is to influence Democratic bills ... As far as domestic policy is concerned, it's Nancy Pelosi's world - Bush just lives in it.\" The State of the Union is a format that suits Bush well, and this outing was no exception. The preliminary back-slapping, the live audience, the regular bursts of applause: hardly surprising he looked markedly less stilted than during his taped speech on Iraq. \"Bush projected comfort and ease throughout,\" NRO's TJ Walker writes. \"When he successfully pronounced the name of a foreign country or leader, he didn't say it with the tone that suggested he was proud of it. Instead, he just spoke as if he really knew his stuff and was comfortable with all of the material, just as a leader should.\" Even so, some observers thought Bush needed to make more of an effort to keep things lively. \"Bush, for all of his many tragic flaws, is capable of delivering a decent speech,\" writes Carpetbagger. \"With this in mind, last night was just ... boring. Anticlimactic. Void of soaring rhetoric and almost anything of any interest at all. The speech and its delivery felt obligatory. The president might as well have just skipped the event altogether.\" \u2022 Plenty of pundits picked up on Bush's graceful hat-tip to Congress's first female speaker, Nancy Pelosi. \"It would be nice if this type of respect were to define their relationship for the next two years, much as, in the 1980s, Ronald Reagan and then-Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill, while differing greatly on policy issues, respected each other as individuals -- and even enjoyed each other's company,\" daydreamed Gay Patriot. No chance of that: moments later, Bush needled his opponents by referring to them as \"the Democrat majority\" - a carefully loaded turn of phrase. \"What a strange man,\" sighed Josh Marshall. \"After disarmingly gracious opening remarks about Nancy Pelosi's speakership, the president congratulates the 'Democrat majority' - words most every Democrat takes as a calculated insult. The prepared remarks say 'Democratic majority'. But apparently he couldn't help himself.\" \u2022 If the speech itself was a little anticlimactic, Bush's guests did their best to help stir things up. As Richard Adams predicted, New York subway hero Wesley Autrey made the cut, and milked his moment for all it was worth. \"Brave but not so humble,\" noted Andrew Sullivan as Autrey soaked up applause. \"The subway dude is spreading the love. I'm letting go and giving in. America! Yay!\" The place of honour next to Laura Bush, meanwhile, went to basketball star Dikembe Mutumbo; and at 7'2\", there was the added bonus that he made the first lady and her companions look like Munchkins. \"Oh my God, they just stood up. He's a giant! And the woman on his right is tiny!\" gasped MoJo's liveblogger. \"Again, how can he be only three inches taller than the first lady when seated? Is Laura Bush on a booster seat?\" \u2022 One of the fun things about the State of the Union address, of course, was that Dick Cheney and Nancy Pelosi were trapped live on camera together doing virtually nothing for almost an hour. Hot Johnny seized the opportunity, liveblogging the gurning and twitching of the sinister Mr Cheney in minute detail. \"He reminded me a lot of myself when I was a kid during Sunday morning worship: a lot of fidgeting, a lot of looking around, and a lot of smiles to friends somewhere else in the building,\" Johnny writes. \"Fortunately, he had no mother pinching him to keep still.\" Most of the Cheney-watching was fairly mundane - \"11:21 Possible chewing ... 12:07: Chewing confirmed,\" - but intriguingly at one point Cheney appears to be fiddling with his mobile phone. Who could he have been texting? Foreign Policy's Travis Daub has the dirt. \u2022 For Democrats, however, the real highlight of the evening came via Virginia senator Jim Webb, whose robust response on behalf of his party won plaudits from all corners. \"It was, I think, the most effective Democratic response in the Bush years,\" writes Andrew Sullivan. \"He managed to bridge economic populism with military service and pride ... and he said it with testosterone and authority.\" Newsweek's Jonathan Alter led the scramble to sing Webb's praises. \"For the first time ever, the response to the State of the Union Message overshadowed the president's big speech,\" he writes, noting that Webb tore up the suggested talking points and wrote his own speech from scratch. The fuss even led Daily Kos to post an open letter to the media, reminding them that Webb was a netroots darling. \"We were working on his behalf before you even knew there would be a competitive Senate race in Virginia,\" Markos writes. \"We don't expect you to traffic in complexity. But remember this - Jim Webb is a people-powered candidate. He's one of ours.\" Not everyone was singing Webb's praises, of course - \"On TV, he looks and sounds like a Muppet,\" grouched the Corner's John Podhoretz - but the consensus seems to be that his speech was a barnstormer, and maybe even enough to earn him a vice-presidential slot on the Democratic party's presidential ticket.
