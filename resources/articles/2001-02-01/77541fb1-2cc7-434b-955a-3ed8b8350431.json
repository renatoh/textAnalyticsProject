So says Rovers' on-loan defender Richard Jobson who along with his team-mates, celebrated Saturday's FA Cup fifth-round draw at Premiership Southampton. Tonight's replay at Prenton Park could take Tranmere's Premiership victims to seven in recent seasons and set up an enticing sixth-round meeting against Aldridge's old team Liverpool. But the prospect of relegation gives the former striker sleepless nights. However, Jobson, outstanding on Saturday, believes that Aldridge is still the man for the job. \"He has done wonders for Tranmere in the nearly five years he's been in charge. There's no point in looking at the situation over the past month or two. You've got to look at the overall picture. He definitely is the right man for the job. That's not in question.\" Aldridge has injury worries ahead of today's game. Clint Hill is ruled out for a month and Dave Challinor is doubtful. Southampton are down to bare bones, with Matt Oakley and Kevin Davies out injured, Tahar El Khalej away winning his 100th Moroccan cap and Dan Petrescu cup-tied. Wycombe are almost sure to throw 19-year-old Ben Townsend into the fray in tonight's other FA Cup replay at Wimbledon, with the winners away to Leicester. Lawrie Sanchez's return to his old club has been marred by an ankle injury sustained by right-back Mark Rogers in Saturday's controversial 2-2 draw. Gerard Lavin, another right-back on loan from Bristol City, is also injured. Wimbledon's spirits, undermined by Saturday's draw, may be dealt another blow. Financial pressures at the cash-strapped club could see yet another of their best players departing. Manchester City have been linked with a move for the Dons' Norwegian international midfielder Trond Andersen. Meanwhile the team's veteran defender Alan Kimble will have a late fitness test before tonight's game. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
