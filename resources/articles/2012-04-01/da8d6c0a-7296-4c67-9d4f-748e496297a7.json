The World Cup itself, the richest prize in the sport, was more towards the former extreme than the latter, though it is hard to think that Monterosso, the winner, will now march on to even better things. Three years into its existence, Meydan still awaits its first truly world-class World Cup winner. His jockey, on the other hand, is a precocious talent with untold success still ahead of him. There are fine riders in every generation, but few with the mental strength to fully exploit their ability from a very young age. Steve Cauthen, a Triple Crown winner at 18, was one, and Frankie Dettori, who recorded a Group One double at Ascot at 19, another. After Saturday, it is hard to argue against adding Mickael Barzalona to the list. Some would say that he was already there, thanks to his success, and the unforgettable manner of it, in the Derby last June. The image of Barzalona up in his irons and saluting the crowd while the race, in theory at least, was still in progress will be attached to him for life, and when he struck a similar pose on Monterosso on Saturday, it turned into his trademark. Barzalona was three lengths to the good when he started to celebrate on Saturday, rather than delivering a challenge for the lead, as he was at Epsom. Yet the Dubai stewards still fined him about \u00a3850 for \"gesticulating well prior to the winning post\", suggesting that they share the view of some that he is too flash by half. The point that this sour-faced attitude seems to miss is that racing is not only a sport, but also a form of entertainment, and at its best when it mixes both ingredients. It needs a paying audience, so what's wrong with putting on a show? No 20-year-old is a completely finished article, of course, and Barzalona's star could yet suffer a decline to match its rapid ascent. But he is in excellent hands, since Godolphin clearly see him as the natural successor to Dettori, their jockey for nearly two decades, in another three or four years. They will do all they can to turn him into one of the most famous and wealthy riders on the planet, assuming Barzalona has the sense to let them. If so, he could still be winning the biggest races in his 40s, like his countryman Olivier Peslier, whose experience appeared the crucial factor in deciding a wonderful race for the Dubai Sheema Classic. Peslier was simply in a better position throughout on Cirrus Des Aigles, and though Joseph O'Brien, on St Nicholas Abbey, saved ground against the rail, it also cost him a couple of strides when he needed to space to begin his challenge. O'Brien did not do anything wrong, but Peslier did a little more that was just right. The jockey who probably made the most difference on the night, though, was James Doyle, who made sure that his first Group-race win of any kind was a particularly rewarding one. The Dubai Duty Free is worth \u00a31.8m to the winner, more than twice as much as the Derby, and Doyle had it won from the moment he kicked off the bend on Cityscape and took four lengths out of unwary opponents. It was a smart, assured ride that got the result it deserved. What a pity, then, that with so much to celebrate in Saturday's races, the final memory was that of Bronze Cannon breaking his leg in the Gold Cup, which was re-run at the end of the card when Toni Braxton was supposed to launching the post-race party. The decision to re-stage the race cannot have been easy, since the initial attempt had been abandoned when Fox Hunt suffered one of the most shocking injuries the sport will ever see. But it was clearly risky, and while the subsequent fatal injuries to Bronze Cannon and Grand Vent were not the PR catastrophe in Dubai's more regulated media environment that it would have been in the UK, it still offers a lesson for the sport here. The owners and trainers were keen to run the Gold Cup, but owners and trainers can't always see beyond an individual prize and appreciate the big picture. First time around, the small but ever-present risk to horses and riders was, by definition, one worth taking. Second time around, it was not, which is something that any track facing a similar dilemma in future would do well to remember."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
