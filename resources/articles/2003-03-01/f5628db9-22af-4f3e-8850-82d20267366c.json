Under the BBC's two-year deal agreed at the start of this season, it can show 38 live games per season but, apart from the four Old Firm derbies between Rangers and Celtic, they must only be broadcast in Scotland. An SPL spokesman said the league was told yesterday by the BBC that it would continue to \"black out\" broadcasts to the rest of the country. But industry experts insist there was no way that this could be done if the BBC was broadcasting its signals unencrypted to viewers without smart cards. \"Without a smart card and without the signal being encrypted, there is no way of enforcing black outs,\" said Dermot Nolan, director of media consultancy TBS. And Sky insiders confirmed that there was no way that the BBC could \"black out\" services to various parts of the country without using its conditional access system. The only other option for the BBC would be to renegotiate its rights deal with SPL and face similar renegotiations with other sports and film rights holders around Europe, who are similarly concerned that viewers outside the UK will be able to pick up the BBC's unencrypted broadcasts. Rights holders, particularly the big Hollywood studios, are particularly concerned about English language broadcasts being picked up overseas in countries to which it they have already sold their programmes. The BBC tonight contacted MediaGuardian to admit it didn't have the technology to black out services in Scotland, but it said it would be exploring its options with the Scottish Premier League. If no agreement was reached it said, it would pull the plug on individual matches to ensure no copyright deals were breached. \"We will re-direct viewers to the analogue service, so viewers in Scotland will still be able to see the matches,\" said a spokesman. It has also emerged that, had the BBC been broadcasting on the new satellite during last year's World Cup, it would have faced a black out from rights holders. Last year, German broadcasters ARD and ZDF were unable to broadcast the World Cup matches via digital satellite because they transmitted their signals on a free to air basis. In that case the signal also \"leaked\" into other countries under the footprint and, as Kirch had already sold rights to pay TV broadcasters in other territories, it was unable to broadcast them on satellite."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
