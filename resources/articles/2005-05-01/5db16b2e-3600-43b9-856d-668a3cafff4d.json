At its first annual conference in 2001 most delegates wore replica shirts and there were more beards than at a Camra convention. In 2004 club colours were largely replaced by shirts and suits, the chancellor Gordon Brown sent a video message pledging \u00a36m and the Football League chairman Sir Brian - now Lord - Mawhinney addressed the floor, as did the Professional Footballers' Association. It is a measure of the growing influence and professionalism of the organisation that after years struggling for a toe hold in the game, football's senior stakeholders now come to them. With 100 trusts in the UK based on the mutually owned democratic model, 61 of which hold equity in their clubs and 39 board representation, Philip French, Supporters Direct's new managing director, inherits an organisation in rude health. \"It is a fantastic time to be joining,\" he says. \"The supporters' trust movement has never been stronger and my job is to take it on to the next level. This is the way forward for football. For clubs to remain a focal point of local communities supporters have to have more than a remote feeling of ownership; they should have the means and the opportunity to be involved.\" French, 37, appears well placed to take the organisation on. Energetic and voluble, his imposing frame has been increasingly visible in the margins of sport and politics for a decade. During five years at the Premier League, starting in the press office and culminating as director of public policy, he compiled an enviable contacts book and enjoyed a front-row seat at football's most recent and divisive power struggles. He has the political contacts necessary to maintain SD's place in the affections of a Labour government that has encouraged its growth. A long-standing friend of its chairman Andy Burnham, the MP for Leigh, he worked for Tessa Jowell at the 1992 election and joined the office of Tom - now Lord - Pendry when the latter was shadow sports minister. As the Premier League's point man for the media he was endlessly loyal to an organisation many see as the antithesis of supporters' interests. By taking the job he is crossing football's house, moving from the temple of the free-market approach to an organisation that espouses collective democratic ownership as its guiding principle. But for him it is something of a return. He was secretary of the All-Party Football Group for 10 years and was involved with Burnham in the establishment of the Football Task Force and the Football Foundation. \"What has motivated me has been to try and deliver something meaningful. This is an organisation committed to ensuring clubs are not only part of their community but controlled by and an asset for the community.\" French's agenda is focused on increasing the organisation's clout within the Football Association, adding to the list of clubs where supporters take an active role and developing the model of financial stability and good practice that makes the trust model so attractive. It can apply from Macclesfield to Manchester United, he says. \"One of Supporters Direct's key aims is to help deliver accountability,\" he says. \"How often have we seen people arrive at football clubs, gamble on the finances and walk away leaving others to inherit the mess? And we are not talking just about small clubs. The prospect of what might happen at Manchester United is frightening.\" \"Supporters' trusts bring a level of accountability and financial realism that is desperately needed. If you start to look at the success of Brentford or Exeter and see how hard their trusts have worked to turn around the fortunes of their clubs, then you start to realise just what a vital force they have become in the game. \"The beauty of the supporters' trust model is that it acts as an important check and restraint on mismanagement. It doesn't negate investment by individuals but it provides a check to make sure people can't walk out leaving clubs in a state.\" French will lobby hard for supporters to receive a voice in the corridors of the FA. \"Brian Barwick [FA chief executive] has made much play of the fact that supporters are the life-blood of the game,\" he says. \"Now the FA has an opportunity to send out a message to the football world and to supporters that they are crucial to the future of the game and to give them a voice. Whether that's a role on the council, at board level or at committee level I don't know but we have a 91-member council with no supporters' representation.\" It would be no surprise were that to change as a result of Lord Burns's structural review of the FA, and even less so if French were to be that voice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
