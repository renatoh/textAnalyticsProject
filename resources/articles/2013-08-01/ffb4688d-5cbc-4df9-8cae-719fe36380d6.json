The Woodland Trust and National Trust are joining forces for the first time in their histories to purchase and restore 825 acres of forest on the northern edge of the Devon moor. Most of Fingle Woods is currently dominated by conifers but the plan is to gradually clear them and let the native woodland regenerate, providing valuable habitat for bird species such as the pied flycatcher, redstart and wood warbler as well as deer and fritillary butterflies. By next spring up to 30 miles of new footpaths should be open. Norman Starks, Woodland Trust operations director said: \"Ancient woodland is the richest land habitat for species in the UK. The best way to restore this woodland back to their former glory is to change the canopy structure gradually, slowly removing the conifers to let the light back in.\" It is likely to be more than half a century before Fingle Woods is completely restored. The two charities are trying to raise \u00a35m to pay for the first 20 years of restoration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
