Thompson, who is touring the country to inspire athletes at the English Schools Championships, said: \"It is a shame when any kid leaves their sport but, if they are doing so because of preventable things, then it seems a real waste. You think that someone would try to find a solution to that particular problem. A lot of the places we have been to there has not been a pole vault coach or whatever, yet there have been some quite talented kids.\" Yesterday the dilemma was the sprint hurdles. As it happens, the Sainsbury's Futures event was taking place at the University of Bath, where Malcolm Arnold is based. Arnold coached Britain's greatest sprint hurdler Colin Jackson but one of the potential stars of the London Olympics in 2012 is not finding life quite as easy. Lizzie Wessely, 15, from Wellington, Somerset, has just joined Exeter Harriers, yet they do not have a specific hurdles coach. Wessely, second in the under-15 75m hurdles at last year's English Schools' Championships, said: \"It is annoying. The people there [at Exeter] know how to do it but I need more. I could travel to Bath but that is two hours away.\" Thompson is looking to improve the system from within. He said: \"I do not know what can be done at clubs like Exeter. I guess there is a dearth of coaches around the country but it would be a shame if they dropped out because of the fact the nearest coach is a few hours away. I would be happy to sit down with someone from UKA.\" A UK Athletics spokesperson said last night: \"We would welcome Daley's input. It is agreed that there are gaps around the country in technical coaching expertise. We are aware of it, we are addressing it.\" Jason Gardener, who retained his European Indoor 60m title in March, has decided to carry on in the sport after talk that he would retire. He said: \"Everything is being geared towards the summer.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
