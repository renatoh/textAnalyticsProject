Only once, in 1997, have Rusedski and Henman reached the last eight in the same year, and both lost. Already there is animated talk of them playing each other for the greatest prize in grass-court tennis next Sunday. To put such speculation in context, there has been no all-British men's final since 1909, when the tournament was played at Worple Road, and no British men's finalist at the current venue, Church Road, since Bunny Austin in 1938. Fred Perry, nobody will need reminding, was the last British male to win the title two years earlier. History may be bunk but British male players at Wimbledon are made more aware of it than in any other sport. How dearly Henman and Rusedski would love to change the \"not since Fred Perry\" to their own name. This year, of all years, it is not beyond the realms of possibility, although highly unlikely. The bookmakers are offering 9-2 on an all-British final, which seems preposterous given that Rusedski has never progressed beyond the quarter-final, though Henman is a three-times beaten semi-finalist. Yet, for all the upsets and shocks of the first week, the probability of the semi-final between Henman and Australia's Lleyton Hewitt, the world No1, has remained intact. Should it take place next Friday, it could be the most crucial match of the fortnight. Certainly the winner would be the clear favourite for the title. Those on the other side of the draw, including Rusedski, may disagree but, as matters stand, the 21-year-old Hewitt is the overwhelming favourite for the title, having never lost to Henman in five meetings and dropped only two sets against him. \"I got better and better with every match I played at the US Open and right now I feel as good as I did then,\" said Hewitt ominously. Yesterday Wimbledon took its ease. Had any member of the public got inside the ground they could have seen Australia's John Newcombe, three times the Wimbledon champion, walking briskly along the walkways to Aorangi Park for a spot of practice for the senior event. Recognising many of today's competitors in the fourth round making their way to the practice courts would have been altogether more difficult. Andre Sa, Feliciano Lopez, David Nalbandian and Mikhail Youzhny, to name but four, could pass unnoticed down any of the world's alleyways or on a tennis court for that matter. Yet, come next Sunday, one of this quartet may become the face of Wimbledon 2002. It will not be so if Henman or Rusedski can help it. Of the two Rusedski struck the better form last week, notably in his third-round match against the 19-year-old American Andy Roddick. Henman has frequently appeared ill at ease with his game and might easily have lost to South Africa's Wayne Ferreira on Saturday had not the Portuguese umpire Jorge Dias made a crucial over-rule in Henman's favour during the third-set tie-break. Surprisingly Henman has been placed on No1 court, an arena he does not particularly like, for today's match against Switzerland's Michel Kratochvil, whereas Rusedski is on centre court against Belgium's Xavier Malisse. Rusedski would appear to have the tougher match, the 21-year-old Belgium having secured an excellent straight-sets victory over Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the No5 seed, in the last round. Rusedski practised at Aorangi Park yesterday and was asked how the current opening up of the draw differed from this year's Australian Open, where he lost to Henman in the third round. \"I think in hindsight that I had played too many matches before Melbourne. This time I have had a good break and feel much fresher.\" Malisse is exceptionally quick on his feet and possesses a powerful forehand and a reasonably effective serve. His ponytail singles him out and caused someone to wolf-whistle as he fixed his hair during the Kafelnikov match. He wiggled his hips in response, prompting a huge burst of laughter. This small incident reflected Malisse's relaxed attitude at Wimbledon. His initial expectations were not high, after winning only one match in his previous two visits, and this makes him a dangerous opponent. Rusedski's focus against Roddick was pitiless and unbending, and a repeat would surely be too much for the Belgian. But, should Rusedski's concentration waver, or the rhythm of his serve break down, then Malisse has the ability to take swift advantage. Kratochvil, whose parents fled the former Czechoslovakia in 1968, has crept quietly into the last 16 and Henman will hope he creeps just as quietly out. The 22-year-old Swiss is an excellent returner of serve but Henman's more varied approach, coupled with his wealth of grass-court experience, should tip the balance. \"It's a boost having Greg still in. He played faultlessly against Roddick and we are feeding off each other,\" said Henman. Such symbiosis would not extend to a meeting in the final, presumably."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
