Like his friend Henry James, he depicted the upper crust, although his canvases were of a more flattering kind than his patron's novels. Before he became renowned for the debutantes and upper-class mamas, he honed his art with maritime inspiration from the French and Italian coasts, as this show reveals. Among the 80 paintings, drawings and watercolours are seaside idylls, including the glorious Neapolitan Children Bathing. More surprising is the fact that a transatlantic trip moved Sargent to produce tumultuous Romantic seascapes, such as Mid Ocean, Mid Winter where icy green and black waves swell ominously. Meanwhile, studies of dock life intimate his mature, sober side. Royal Academy of Arts, W1, to 26 Sep Skye Sherwin Book Show, Birmingham Central to this show of artists' books is the work of Ulises Carri\u00f3n \u2013 artist, writer and founder of Amsterdam's Other Books and So bookshop which, between 1975 and 79, established the idea of artists' books. To put it simply, artists' books are books by artists rather than books about artists. Carri\u00f3n puts it less simply but probably more accurately: \"A book is a sequence of spaces. Each of these spaces is perceived at a different moment; a book is also a sequence of moments.\" So artists' books are aesthetic and tactile artworks as well as just books in the literary sense. Here's a display of such work by those renowned in the medium, including John Latham and Marie Lund. Eastside Projects, to 4 Sep Robert Clark Sergej Jensen, London Sergej Jensen once described what he does as \"painting without paint\". Using bleached, stitched and stained fabric, he creates elegantly spare abstract images in organic, oatmeal tones. This quiet, homespun stuff might seem too comfortable if it weren't for Jensen's wry take on art and consumerism. As well as canvas, he's made use of materials such as linen made from recycled money bags. As politely reticent as his work can appear, it comments on the way paintings can double as wall decor and other unseemly art-market side effects. His second London exhibition encompasses 1970s sci-fi from 2001 to Close Encounters, in silver-blues, greys and blacks, and includes experiments with paint. White Cube Mason's Yard, SW1, Fri to 28 Aug Skye Sherwin Tony Sinden, Bristol Up to his premature death last year, the early pioneer of British video art Tony Sinden was an experimenter. Dubbing the gallery a laboratory, he worked not only with moving images but also music, performance and, most significantly, installation. This show focuses on his quietly groundbreaking 1970s work. Nine TV sets take on a sculptural capacity for the brilliantly titled Behold, Vertical Devices. Arranged on a sloping plank, video footage of a running figure slides, flickers and jumps across the TV monitors in an alternative study of time and motion. Then there's Can Can, one of Sinden's very first video installations. Its double projection of out-of-sync footage has a humble beer can rolling up and down a train aisle. Picture This, to 7 Aug Skye Sherwin The the Things Is (For 3), Milton Keynes A mysteriously unnamed artist, referred to in the exhibition publicity as \"the artist\", goes in for what he calls variations of \"hiddenness\". Here, the artist presents strangely incongruous image combinations. WOMAN MAN MAN WOMAN WOMAN WOMAN MAN MAN GEORGE M HESTER (yes indeed, the artist goes in for titles that are blandly literal or impenetrably cryptic) is a series of hermaphroditic collages of photographic male and female nudes. Elsewhere, a rock band's instruments are plugged in and ready to play. Inane or enigmatic or what? Milton Keynes Gallery, to 12 Sep Robert Clark The Tightrope Walker, London With the Hayward Gallery's New Decor and the Barbican's Surreal House, it seems to be a time for shows about art and furniture. Making a triple threat, this exhibition channels the optimism and reflection of postwar Paris in work by 11 artists and designers. It includes such curious bedfellows as outsider art champion Jean Dubuffet and chic designers Charlotte Perriand and Jean Prouv\u00e9. With the populist paintings of Bernard Buffet of sour-faced, angsty skinny men, the expansive ensemble captures the era's conflicted mood. Timothy Taylor, W1, to 27 Aug Skye Sherwin Liberation, Manchester The full title of this group show, Liberation: and Its Relative Meaning, reflects artist Liu Ding's ambivalent observations on the role of the internet in freeing up or closing down the potential for international communications. His installation, Gravestone for Rumour Monger, was inspired by a period in which the artist was made the defenceless target of online slander. There are weeping black clouds and a maze of dark corners behind which people can hide and whisper maliciously. Elsewhere, artists reflect on the fact that the self-publishing, individual voice enabled by Twitter, Facebook and YouTube has been politically censored in China. Chinese Arts Centre, to 14 Aug Robert Clark William Morris, Bowness-on-Windermere Reacting to the experiential and environmental wastage of the industrial revolution, the Arts and Crafts pioneer William Morris posited a collective lifestyle in which like-minded socialists would live and work amid surroundings made special by their cherished creations. A treasuring of natural and architectural place was crucial to Morris's worldview. In the charming Blackwell Arts and Crafts House, this exhibition charts Morris's sense of place through graphic design, textiles, hand-printed books and photographs of the bearded back-to-nature genius himself. Morris's houses are well documented, including the Red House in Bexleyheath, which he planned to make \"the beautifulest place on Earth\". While Morris's project might appear idealistic and economically unrealistic, his life may now read as an early warning of our present-day ecological alarm.
