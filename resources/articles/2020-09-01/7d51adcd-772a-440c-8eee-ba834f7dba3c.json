Here\u2019s our Carabao Cup roundup Everton go away to Fleetwood Town next. \u201cOkay, I haven\u2019t a clue as to what the Northampton/ Villa/ Charlton/ Liverpool thing is all about,\u201d says Geoff Wignall. \u201cBut I reckon the shortest name must now be Fulham and by my reckoning, three clubs with an x factor (Exeter, Oxford and Crewe) . Clubs whose name starts and ends with the same letter. And yes, we\u2019ve lost Halifax and Wrexham from the Xs. Gordon\u2019s played well in the second half. He\u2019s quick and has plenty of confidence. Everton hit the post twice! Kenny crosses well from the left and Kean leaps well, cracking a header into the upright, then Gordon lashes the rebound straight back into it! Incidentally, Duncan Ferguson is in the ground. Eeek. Kean does some high pigeon-steps, leaps, and as Hladky goes left, he sweeps high into the middle! Gordon skates towards the line and Bruno Andrade can\u2019t help but dangle a leg from the wrong side, and that\u2019s a clear penalty. Moise Kean immediately grabs the ball. That was exciting! It\u2019s always funny when a team fight their way back at the last, only to lose anyway, and that\u2019s what happened there. In fairness to Hull, they were by far the better side. They visit West Ham next. Ingram saves from Shackleton! If Hull score their next one, they win! Batty scores for Hull! Casilla scores for Leeds! Someone scores for Hull! Gotts scores for Leeds! Chadwick scores for Hull! Davis scores for Leeds! McLoughlin smashes in for Hull! Sudden death it is, and Struijk scores for Leeds! Mayer drills down the middle for Hull! Douglas scores for Leeds! Scott scores for Hull! Poveda scores for Leeds! Casilla saves from Coyle! Back even! Roberts scores for Leeds! Nkounkou goes down the left, finds Gordon, and Sigurdsson punches home his cross to finish things. Jones scores for Hull! Alioski misses! Football you absolute bitch! Oh great. My stream has vanished, but it\u2019s 1-1 on penalties... There\u2019s still not much going on at Goodison, and Ancelotti is getting noised up as a consequence. Hull scored all five penalties in beating Sunderland in the last round; Leeds didn\u2019t manage a shot on target during the first 89 minutes of this game. They\u2019ll now take penalties for the \u201cprivilege\u201d of visiting the London Stadium. What a finish! Leeds force a couple of corners, and when the second isn\u2019t cleared, the ball ends up running across Alioski, who swivels onto it and screws a brilliant left-footed finish high into the far top corner! Hull should\u2019ve been sorted ages ago, and that\u2019s what happens when you miss your chances. The Bees are away to West Brom next. City play Villa next. Four additional minutes at Elland Road. And which teams have an x in their name? \u201cIf you\u2019re doing updates on ancient quiz questions,\u201d says Andrew Goudie, \u201cwho has taken over Bury\u2019s claim to fame of having the shortest name in the league?\u201d That\u2019s two goals and an assist for yerman. Hull should finish it! Docherty sends Scott in through the middle, but his finish is tentative and Casilla blocks it behind. Three minutes of the 90 remaining. At Goodison, Wilson goes down the right and digs out a cross that Hunter heads down ... only for Towell to leather over the top! That was as good a chance as Salford are getting. \u201cDo you know what\u2019s the case with Northampton,\u201d says Simon Dobinson. \u201cI do know if the other three clubs are Liverpool, Aston Villa and Charlton Athletic?\u201d There you go. We used to have York City, might get Solihull Moors one day, and Scotland has Dundee United, Kilmarnock, and Celtic if you don\u2019t call them Glasgow Celtic. Even more all over at Ashton Gate. Semenyo missed a decent chance a few minutes ago, but quickly made up for it, collecting Palmer\u2019s backheel and scoring at the second attempt. \u201cGenesis of Psalm 23 at West Brom?\u201d says Tom Levesley? \u201cIt\u2019s all down to an Everton game, and look who we\u2019re playing on Saturday...\u201d Thanks very much. While that was going on, Hull almost scored again at Leeds, but I didn\u2019t quite see what happened. Sigurdsson swings over a lovely cross, and Kean is up ... but he heads wide! That was not a good effort, and it\u2019s extremely lucky Duncan Ferguson isn\u2019t in the immediate vicinity. \u201cIs the answer that Northampton have a dragon on their crest?\u201d asks K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cI can think of two others, Carlisle and Leyton Orient, but I\u2019ll admit the third is escaping my memory.\u201d I guess it is an answer if there\u2019s another one, but otherwise, it\u2019s good but it\u2019s not right. At Elland Road, Hull are enjoying most of the ball. Off we go again... At Goodison, the Everton players are back with us. Salford are still in the dressing room. Twenty minutes to go at Elland Road, with Hull looking at least as likely to score. Docherty attacks the Leeds box and unleashes a drive, but it\u2019s too close to Casilla, who dives to paw it away. He made that look a lot harder than it was. Do you know what\u2019s the case with Northampton that\u2019s only so of three other clubs among the 92? It\u2019s still Southampton 0-2 Brentford and Bristol City 2-0 Northampton Town. Leeds haven\u2019t created much tonight \u2013 I guess we\u2019ll see how bothered Bielsa is by how many changes he makes. So far, he\u2019s only brought Struik on for Casey. \u201cFrom Carabao to Qarabag in the Champions League,\u201d says Kevin Porter, \u201cas Norwegians, Molde eliminate their Azerbaijani hosts in an epic penalty shoot-out. After 11 successive successful penalties, the unfortunate Huysenov fails from the spot.\u201d That sounds glorious. Everton started well but have slowed down since, and though Salford haven\u2019t created anything, they\u2019re still in the game, which is all they\u2019d have really wanted. Gary Nev reckons his manager will be irritated that Salford conceded from a set-piece, but I guess it\u2019s not just an issue of organisation, but of skill \u2013 focus is a skill, and so is crossing and heading. Back in Leeds, Poveda scuttle-dashes into the box between two challenges, but runs out position just as he\u2019s ready to shoot. He\u2019s looked lively since half-time. Mitrovic\u2019s first-half header is enough to earn a third-round home tie with Sheffield Wednesday. Bernard is enjoying himself at Goodison, twinkling inside and rasping a curler that Hladky tips around the post. Rodrigo is putting himself about now. I\u2019m not sure why, but I\u2019m feeling big Soldado vibes from him. At Elland Road, Hull have started the second half really strongly. There\u2019s not a lot going on at Goodison, which is great for Salford, who\u2019d love to trail 1-0 going into the last 10. We\u2019re also back underway at St Mary\u2019s and Elland Road. We\u2019re playing injury-time at Portman Road; can Ipswich find an equaliser? I\u2019d forgotten that Everton are sponsored by Hummel. Other Hummel efforts... Bit of possession for Salford, but they can\u2019t make anything of it. He looks extremely displeased with things, and is replaced by Digne. Branthwaite is down, having landed awkwardly when clipping a pass back home. It\u2019s never good to see a player go down with no one near, but it looks a strain, not anything more sinister. At Portman Road, Fulham still lead Ipswich 1-0, with 13 minutes to go. We\u2019ve got Carragher and Neville back2back on Sky, and Neville emits an odd noise when one of his defenders plays a dodgy square ball that Bernard almost intercepts. \u201cIs that the opposite of the goalgasm,\u201d his mate inquires. At OT, England need wickets, because Australia are well up with the rate. Catch the official end of the summer with Tim de Lisla. Decent game, this one. Hull could\u2019ve scored more, but Leeds also look dangerous. This one is almost over! Da Silva drives home; lucky Southampton played their first XI, because how many would they be losing by otherwise? Eliasson crosses, Semenyo knocks it back from beyond the back post, and Martin is there to nod home his first goal for the club. Everton are looking decent under Ancelotti \u2013 their first XI has some proper players, and because of how they\u2019ve strengthened, the squad players are also decent. And here\u2019s one of them, Tom Davies taking the ball off Walcott and lashing a low shot just wide. At Love Street, Celtic now lead St Mirren 2-1, Forrest and Duffy with the goals. A few minutes after Danny Ings hits the post for Southampton, Norgaard thuds home a header from Mbeumo\u2019s corner. In commentary, Gary Neville was saying that what we saw Gordon do is a what can happen to a diamond \u2013 there\u2019s very little midfield cover for the full-backs. Sigurdsson curls flat and hard towards the near post and Keane arrives to jump all over Turnbull, powering a header past Hladky. Lovely from Gordon, who gets the ball out on the left, sticks it behind his man and screeches after it, crossing low to win a corner... \u201cI\u2019m not sure if the owners had a word,\u201d says Andrew Goudie, but Salford \u2018rested\u2019 most of their first team in that 6-0 drubbing by Manchester United.\u201d Yeah, I think four of tonight\u2019s starters started that one. Nice from Bernard, who curves in a cross towards Walcott at the far post ... but Walcott sort of turns his body while getting under the ball, heading over from six yards. At Elland Road, Wilks suddenly finds space and drives towards the Leeds box, prodding a low shot that Casilla saves down to his left. Pre-match, Danny Weber was also talking about James Wilson \u2013 also ex-United, he does some work for MUTV and will know exactly how good he should now be. But points out that he\u2019s only scored one goal for the club, and time is running out. Everton knock it about, Salford sit off. I love Goodison, one of the last great grounds. I\u2019m sure the new version will be dead fancy, but it won\u2019t have the same character. At Goodison, the players take a knee. All black lives matter, people. At Elland Road, Leeds are pushing. The players are coming out... Ancelotti says this competition is important for Everton, and he wants fresh legs on the pitch, as well as an opportunity for players to prove themselves to him. Graham Alexander, meanwhile, says whoever Everton pick, they\u2019re up against a quality side and his players need to focus on what they\u2019re trying to do. He has confidence in them, but they\u2019re a new side, so are learning about each other. On Salford, it\u2019s worth noting that they\u2019ve never played Premier League position, and just last week were walloped 6-0 at home by Man United\u2019s u23 side. In fairness, that had some serious talent in it \u2013 Dylan Levitt is already a full international, Ethan Laird will play for United\u2019s first team, and Hannibal Mejbri will be a star - but still, not great. As for Everton, Virginia and Nkounkou make their debuts. Keane is the only survivor from the weekend, and Jamie Redknapp talks about how much he\u2019s looking forward to watching Anthony Gordon, who plays midfield and says he\u2019s a big talent. Looking at that Salford team, it\u2019s really surprising to see James Wilson in it. He was absolutely brilliant in Man United\u2019s youth team and reserves, not as good as Mason Greenwood but not miles off. But for whatever reason, it\u2019s not quite worked out for him, which is a shame \u2013 he had great pace, a brilliant leap, and composure in front of goal, scoring twice on his United debut. Elsewhere, it\u2019s cooking at OT. On which point, the appointment of Neil Lennon seemed a real retrograde step. What new ideas was he ever going to bring? In Scotland, Celtic trail St Mirren 1-0. If they lose that, they\u2019ll be six points behind Rangers already. Kyle Edwards is man of the match. He seems like a lot of fun, and here\u2019s his latest single. Yes, you read that correctly. West Brom will play Southampton or Brentford next. \u201cIf I had a guess I\u2019d say the reason why there\u2019s a banner (and why they sing) The Lord is my shepherd at West Brom,\u201d says JR in Illinois, \u201cis the same reason why the national rugby team supporters sing the old slave spiritual Swing Low, Sweet Chariot: English people are really weird.\u201d I cannot argue. That was a decent performance from West Brom, and Slaven Bilic has a couple of players, Edwards and Harper in particular, pressing for weekend selection. Fulham could use a win here, because they looked mles out of their depth at the weekend. Hull\u2019s press wins possession and Wilks finds Honeyman, who gives him the ball back, and his shot is deflected home. I don\u2019t get why the FA don\u2019t require all clubs to pay into a fund to be used for bailing out clubs. It\u2019s true that it might encourage owners to speculate, but that too can be regulated, and anyone doing anything stupid can be kicked out. We can\u2019t have fans and communities losing their heritage and identity because people are idiots, or because corona is an idiot. And in related news... After Macc\u2019s demise, more terrible news, in exclusive form. Everton also change everything, but have plenty on the bench should they make an everton of things. James Rodriguez, though, is spared \u2013 I wonder what he\u2019s up to tonight \u2013 while I did not know that Darr-on Gibs-on played for Salford these days. Everton: Virgina, Kenny, Keane, Branthwaite, Nkounkou, Davies, Sigurdsson, Davies, Walcott, Gordon, Bernard, Kean. Subs: Pickford, Allan, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin, Digne, Doucoure, Coleman. Salford City: Hladky, Threlkeld, Turnbull, Eastham, Touray, Towell, Lowe, Hunter, Wilson, Henderson, Thomas-Asante. Subs: Armstrong, Gibson, Elliott, Andrade, Denny, Evans, Golden. Back to Leeds, Marcelo Bielsa makes 11 changes from the defeat at Anfield, which makes sense. His first team is decent, but beneath that he doesn\u2019t have the strength in depth other teams do, and his priority is staying up and finishing as high as he can. Tangentially, we see some classic Bielsa in Especial 20 A\u00f1os de F\u00fatbol de Primera, a show currently on Netflix, celebrating 20 years of Argentina\u2019s most popular football highlights show. I cannot recommend it enough \u2013 the hair, clobber and celebrations are absolutely top-notch, before we\u2019ve even thought about the football. Tete crosses from the left, and Mitrovic powers home a birthday header. Lovely from Kyle Edwards, diddling his man on the left touchline and haring into the box before sliding across to give Robinson a tap-in. Done and done. Leeds United: Casilla, Davis, Casey, Cresswell, Douglas, Bogusz, Poveda, Shackleton, Roberts, Alioski, Rodrigo. Subs: Meslier, Bamford, Struik, Harrison, Phillips, McCalmont, Gotts. Hull City: Ingram, Coyle, Jones, McLoughlin, Elder, Docherty, Batty, Wilks, Honeyman, Lewis-Potter, Scott. Subs: Emmanuel, Samuelsen, Mayer, Greaves, Chadwick, Cartwright, Jones. Missilou, eh? Bristol City: O\u2019Leary, Vyner, Kalas, Mawson, Sessegnon, Bakinson, Nagy, Eliasson, Palmer, Martin, Semenyo. Subs: Bentley, Diedhiou, Weimann, Wells, Moore, Rowe Brunt. Northampton Town: Mitchell, Racic, Bolger, Horsfall, Harriman, Missilou, Watson, Martin, Hoskins, Chukwuemeka, Ashley-Seal. Subs: Arnold, Lines, Roberts, Warburton, Mills, Johnston, Marshall. So Ralph Hasenhuttl goes strong, which seems a decent plan to me \u2013 it\u2019s an opportunity to get players fit for the league, if nothing else. Southampton: McCarthy, Walker-Peters, Stephens, Bednarek, Bertrand, Tella, Ward-Prowse, Romeu, Redmond, Adams, Ings. Subs: Vestergaard, Long, Djenepo, Obafemi, Smallbone, Vokins, Forster. Brentford: Daniels, Dalsgaard, Goode, Bech Sorensen, Thompson, Baptise, Norgaard, Dasilva, Mbeumo, Forss, Fosu. Subs: Henry, Pinnock, Marcondes, Dervisoglu, Zamburek. This bazzer was also on heavy rotation. \u201cThanks for the preamble tunes,\u201d emails Peter Oh. \u201cHere is a song that the Cup sponsors probably frown on, because the chorus includes a line that sounds suspiciously like \u2018I don\u2019t Carabao that\u2019.\u201d That tune was in the charts the first time I had access to MTV, staying in a (nasty) hotel without my parents for the first time. What a video! There\u2019s not a whole lot going on at the Hawthorns, so let\u2019s have a look at the teams elsewhere. Robson-Kanu is replaced by Sawyers, while Harrogate send Beck on for Stead. The teams in full... Ipswich Town: Cornell, Donacien, Nsiala, Wilson, Kenlock, Nolan, Dozzell, Huws, Edwards, Hawkins, Dobra. Subs: Holy, Chambers, Norwood, Bishop, Judge, Sears, Downes. Fulham: Areola, Tete, Odoi, Le Marchand, Robinson, Zambo Angissa, Lemina, Reid, Knockaert, Kebano, Mitrovic. Subs: Hector, Cairney, Cavaleiro, Reed, Bryan, Fabri, Francois. I love this. They\u2019re underway at Portman Road, where it\u2019s still Ipswich 0-0 Fulham. West Brom send on Matt Phillips for Kamil Grosicki, who shakes his head ruefully. Yes, that is \u201cStead\u201d as in \u201cJohn Stead\u201d. These are our teams, by the way: West Brom: Button, Peltier, Kipre, O\u2019Shea, Townsend, Grosicki, Field, Harper, Edwards, Austin, Robson-Kanu. Subs: Furlong, Ajayi, Robinson, Phillips, Sawyers, Bond, Soule. Harrogate Town: Cracknell, Fallowfield, Smith, Hall, Burrell, Thomson, Falkingham, Kerry, Muldoon, Beck, Martin. Subs: Jones, Kiernan, Kirby, Stead, Walker, Minter, Lokko. It\u2019s all West Brom at the moment \u2013 Grosicki\u2019s free-kick has just flashed across the face of the goal, and someone ought really to have turned it in, while a few minutes earlier, Edwards\u2019 low cross skated across the box. And the OG version. A modern version of the same... Can someone please tell me why West Brom have a banner reading \u201cThe Lord is my shepherd\u201d over a couple of blocks of seats? It\u2019s looking comfortable for West Brom \u2013 two goals in four minutes, from Rekeem Harper and Hal Robson-Kanu, have put them in command against Harrogate Town, making their debut in this competition. They looked a very smart side when I saw them in the playoff final, and they\u2019ve played pretty well tonight, but two excellent finishes have pretty much finished the tie. Evening everyone, and welcome to another night of energy drink shenanigans. Also, why isn\u2019t the plural of shenanigan shenaniga? Anyway, this is what we\u2019ve got for youse the night: West Bromwich Albion 2-0 Harrogate Town (6pm, currently half-time) Ipswich Town v Fulham (7pm) Southampton v Brentford (7.45pm) Bristol City v Northampton Town (7.45pm) Leeds United v Hull City (7.45pm) Everton v Salford City (8.15pm) AND IT\u2019S LIVE!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
