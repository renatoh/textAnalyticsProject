Ashgar, odds-on favourite when only third in a novice hurdle at Plumpton on March 30, was found to have tested positive to ACP (acetylpromazine), the \"stopping\" drug at the centre of the long-running race-fixing and doping investigations that ended when the case collapsed in October 2000. Betting patterns of the Plumpton race have so far shown no irregularity, but Jockey Club officials are aware of the threat posed by illegal bookmakers and the far reaching consequences of internet betting with its worldwide audience. Ashgar's race went out live on Satellite Information Services (SIS) and, even at such a small course, would have attracted a large audience. The six-year-old gelding, who was ridden by Paul Flynn, started 5-6 for the modest race on Easter Saturday but trailed in third, beaten seven lengths, behind Boring Goring. Jockey Club security staff were at Plumpton racecourse on Monday and paid particular attention to the track's stabling arrangements. Earlier they had visited the gelding's Somerset stable to interview trainer Philip Hobbs. Hobbs said yesterday: \"I was shocked, obviously. But no blame has been directed at us and we have never used ACP. This isn't even a definite positive at this stage. We are still awaiting the result of a second test which in the past has been known to be proved negative.\" Ashgar opened at 4-6 then drifted to evens and 11-10 in places, before starting at 5-6. There was support for the second favourite, After The Blue, into 11-4 from 7-2 with an on-course bet struck of \u00a3500 to win \u00a31,500. But those responsible for the doping of Ashgar would have no need to try and back the winner of the race. Their aim would be to take as much money as possible in bets on the favourite, safe in the knowledge that it could not win. Betfair, the No1 Internet betting exchange, was visited by the Jockey Club security team. Mark Davies, the company's communications director, said: \"We saw a normal pattern of betting throughout the event. We, along with one other bookmaker, were the two sources which the Jockey Club conferred with when it initiated its investigation. \"The Jockey Club had doubts about the race, phoned us up last week and said they had their suspicions and would like to see if betting patterns could prove it. \"They came down to see us and after looking at the patterns in our system, they conclusively decided there was no reason for suspicion and went away happy. After their check, and the fact that they were satisfied, we didn't look any further into it.\" John Maxse, the Jockey Club's public relations director, confirmed that they were investigating the result of a sample taken from Ashgar which showed traces of ACP. \"Contrary to previous instances when traces of ACP have been identified, no evidence has emerged to date to suggest an attempt was made to fix the result of the race for monetory gain. The investigation is continuing,\" said Maxse. \"Every sample taken from a horse is divided into two - an 'A' and a 'B'. So far only the A sample has been tested. The B sample has been sent to another recognised laboratory for confirmatory analysis. We should know the result within the next seven days. \"ACP is widely available and regularly used as a sedative if, for example a horse needs to be clipped. It can come in a number of forms - tablet, where it is usually included in the horse's feed. That takes about an hour and a half to work. \"It can also be administered as a sort of paste, like you would worm a pet, down the throat and that, because it is neat, kicks in a bit quicker, probably about 45 minutes, or it can be injected into the bloodstream and that acts in a matter of minutes. \"We don't know how long it would last in a horse's system, but that is one of the avenues we are looking into. At present there is no indication that the Hobbs yard had administered it to Ashgar whatsoever.\" Roughly one in 10 of all runners are dope-tested in the course of a year with some 7,700 samples analysed. \"About seven or eight horses are selected randomly per meeting for testing by the local stewards,\" continued Maxse. \"They are often winners or horses which have shown improved form or run below form, and that includes many beaten favourites.\" Ashgar is the eighth horse to test positive for ACP in recent years. No convictions were made in any of those cases, but in each instance the trainers of the horses in question were fined, as the Jockey Club ruling dictates it is the trainer's liability to ensure that prohibited substances are not administered by anyone, whether in any way connected with the trainer or not. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
