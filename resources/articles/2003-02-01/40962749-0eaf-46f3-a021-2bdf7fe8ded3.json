I was just out of school at age 17 and I was there for a year. My boss was a very tough woman. She could be really scary and get right on your case. This was particularly true at stressful times, such as when the bank inspectorate was coming to look at everything. On days like that she would expect all the cashiers to make sure their tills balanced to the penny. Most bank managers in those days were men, but our branch was made up almost entirely of women apart from the assistant manager and one cashier. But my boss was alright to me because I worked hard and was never late. I used to cycle to work and she let me wheel my bicycle through the office and keep it in the bathroom. I once took a couple of days off sick and then secretly went to do a photo shoot with a model agency in Manchester. As it turns out this proved a bit of a bad idea because unknown to me the pictures were for a Yorkshire Bank leaflet! I couldn't believe it on the day I saw it going round the office with my face on - I felt really guilty that I'd done it on the bank's time. It's important to make an effort to be smart and punctual if you're going to the world of work for the first time. I'd already learned discipline and timekeeping because when I was at school I worked in a pizza shop doing all the really rotten jobs like mopping up at night. The boss was always ordering me around and making me work hard and would never accept an apology if I was late. Even if you're feeling crap, I think it's vital to have a really good manner - the easier you are to work with, the further you'll go. If you want to get into modelling it's vital to be patient and not take rejection personally. Have a backup plan for when it's not going so well. Stay positive and put your energy into something else for a while if you need to.
