The Hassan v City of New York case involves 11 plaintiffs, including an Iraq war veteran, university students, a coalition of mosques and the head of a religious school for girls. All plaintiffs are all Muslims citizens from New Jersey subjected to indiscriminate surveillance by the NYPD. The case was heard in the court of appeal on Tuesday after being dismissed by a district court last February. Justice William Martini found last year that the \u201cmotive of the [surveillance] programme was not solely to discriminate against Muslims, but rather to find Muslim terrorists hiding among among ordinary, law-abiding Muslims\u201d. Following Tuesday\u2019s federal appeals hearing in Philadelphia, lawyers representing the plaintiffs told the Guardian they believed the panel of three judges, who are not expected to issue a formal opinion in the case for a number of months, appeared more sympathetic. \u201cThe court got it. They understood that this is a widespread broad-based programme that selects people on a term that\u2019s a protected characteristic \u2013 religion. That\u2019s presumptively unconstitutional. They understood that,\u201d said the Center for Constitutional Rights legal director, Baher Azmy. Up to 200 people rallied outside the courtroom, which was filled to capacity during the hearing. The extent of the surveillance programme, which was devised in the aftermath of 9/11, was exposed in a series of Pulitzer prize-winning reports by the Associated Press in 2011. The programme produced no convictions. The NYPD dispatched plainclothes officers, or \u201crakers\u201d, to Muslim neighbourhoods in New Jersey, monitoring bookstores, bars, nightclubs and cafes. Rakers would compile surveillance papers, which according to plaintiff documents filed with the court of appeal would \u201ccatalogue religiously oriented facts\u201d such as: Muslim prayer mats hanging on restaurant walls flyers posted in shops advertising for Quranic tutoring pictures of mosques hanging in grocery stores restaurants that serve \u201creligious Muslims\u201d or that are located near mosques customers visiting Dunkin\u2019 Donuts after Friday prayer employees or customers of establishments observed wearing \u201ctraditional clothing\u201d stores posting signs announcing that they will be closed in observance of Friday prayer. The NYPD employed informants known as \u201cmosque crawlers\u201d to monitor sermons and conversations inside mosques where there was no evidence of wrongdoing. The NYPD, the appeal documents say, \u201chas tried to insert informants inside every mosque within a 250-mile radius of New York City; it has also prepared an analytical report on every mosque within 100 miles\u201d. The police force\u2019s \u201cdemographics unit\u201d \u2013 disbanded by the NYPD commissioner, Bill Bratton, in 2014 \u2013 targeted \u201cancestries of interest\u201d a designated list of 28 countries associated with the Muslim faith along with \u201cAmerican black Muslims\u201d. All this \u2013 along with other tactics \u2013 resulted in the plaintiffs complaining they feared discussing their faith in public and were forced to cut down their attendance to mosque. Following Tuesday\u2019s hearing Farhaj Hassan, the lead plaintiff and a US army reservist, told the Guardian the programme had meant he stopped attending one of the mosques under surveillance \u201cout of fear of future for my career in the United States army\u201d and cut back his attendance on another two. Hassan added that the city of New York\u2019s decision to continue opposing the case was \u201cextremely saddening\u201d. \u201cI expected more from him [New York City mayor Bill De Blasio],\u201d Hassan said. \u201cIt\u2019s painful that Mayor De Blasio thinks that American Muslims should be treated like second-class citizens by his police force.\u201d Last February, Justice Martini was not persuaded by the plaintiffs\u2019 legal team, who argued the programme was in violation of the first and 14th amendments, enshrining the rights to practice religion. Martini found the plaintiffs had been unable to prove they had been targeted for their religion and thus had not been able to prove any injury incurred. In a twist that further alarmed civil liberties group, Martini\u2019s ruling continued that it was the AP who was responsible for the plaintiffs\u2019 documented grievances: \u201cNone of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries arose until after the Associated Press released unredacted, confidential NYPD documents and articles expressing its own interpretation of those documents \u2026 The harms are not \u2018fairly traceable\u2019 to any act of surveillance.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
