This time, it\u2019s about socks. Photographs emerged on social media of the San Francisco 49ers quarterback wearing socks showing cartoon pigs in police hats. Kaepernick reportedly wore the socks during several practice sessions during the off-season \u2013 weeks before his refusal to stand during the national anthem. Some people, including the head of a national police organization, were upset with the socks, but Kaepernick released a statement to insist that what he chooses to wear on his feet shouldn\u2019t \u201cdistract from the real issues\u201d. Kaepernick said on Thursday: \u201cI wore these socks, in the past, because the rogue cops that are allowed to hold positions in police departments, not only put the community in danger, but also put the cops that have the right intentions in danger by creating an environment of tension and mistrust. I have two uncles and friends who are police officers and work to protect and serve all people. So before these socks, which were worn before I took my public stance, are used to distract from the real issues, I wanted to address this immediately.\u201d According to reports, Kaepernick reportedly wore the socks as early as 10 August, but has not been asked about them until now. Bill Johnson of the National Association of Police Organizations said Kaepernick\u2019s socks dishonored his officers. \u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous that the same league that prohibits the Dallas [Cowboys] football club from honoring the slain officers in their community with their uniforms stands silent when Kaepernick is dishonoring police officers with what he\u2019s wearing on the field,\u201d Johnson said, according to USA Today Sports. \u201cI think the league is in a downward spiral regarding their obligations to the public under [commissioner] Roger Goodell, and this is just another example of that.\u201d Kaepernick is scheduled to start Thursday night\u2019s preseason finale against the San Diego Chargers, who will be holding their annual salute to the military at the game. But Kaepernick said he won\u2019t be standing for the anthem. \u201cI\u2019ll continue to sit,\u201d he told NFL Media. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to stand with the people that are being oppressed. To me, this is something that has to change. When there\u2019s significant change, and I feel like that flag represents what it\u2019s supposed to represent and this country is representing people the way that it\u2019s supposed to, I\u2019ll stand.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
