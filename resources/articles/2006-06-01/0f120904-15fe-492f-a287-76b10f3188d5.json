Monkey hears the unlucky journalists were lured away from their desks to a separate part of Sky's Isleworth HQ to be given the bad news, and returned to discover they had already been locked out of their computers. One person who hasn't been locked out is Rubin, who is staying on as an occasional pundit and presenter for Sky News and might even crop up on Sky One. Let's hope they can find enough for Rubin to do to justify his salary, rumoured to be a cool \u00a3350,000. \u00b7 Unfortunately for Sky, Rubin's show will be around until next month. Which was bad timing when news that Wayne Rooney would indeed be going to the World Cup was broken by the BBC just after 8pm on Wednesday - while Sky was in the middle of World News Tonight. As the BBC's Mike Ingham waxed lyrical on News 24 and Radio 5 Live, Sky was still playing catch-up. \u00b7 As speculation continues over her future, at least Sun editor Rebekah Wade could go on holiday last week basking in the glow of her \"world exclusive\" about Heather Mills McCartney's unfortunate photo-shoot. What a shame that deputy editor Fergus Shanahan put a giant fly in the ointment by using his Friday column to condemn the witch-hunt against her, started, of course, by the Sun. \"She is as entitled to a fresh start as anyone else in life,\" he writes. \"We all make mistakes in life.\" Hear, hear, Fergus. Some of us have even spent a night in a police cell. \u00b7 Most unexpected award winner of 2006 is surely Glamour magazine's TV presenter of the year, none other than ... Davina McCall. True, her BBC1 chatshow will forever have a place in TV history, just not the way she would have wanted. \"I'd be lying if I said it didn't hurt,\" said McCall. \"I don't actually read reviews, but I kept getting hugs off people in supermarkets.\" \u00b7 Wicked whisper: Which BBC executive (with thanks to Popbitch) had a 20-minute chat with Jeff Goldblum at a party at the LA Screenings, only for the Hollywood actor to be heard telling his agent five minutes later: \"Never, ever let that man near me again!\" Who does he think he is? \u00b7 With the World Cup in full swing, the pressure is on to get as many football-related news stories as possible. But Friday's Bizarre column in the Sun had to reach right to the bottom of the barrel for the \"news\" that ITV had \"commissioned\" Kasabian to record a cover of David Bowie's Heroes for its World Cup coverage. Number of weeks since Monkey reported this: two. \u00b7 Talking of which, ITV's big new signing Steve Rider made an inauspicious debut on a World Cup preview show, when his finely-scripted intro was drowned out by the theme music. ITV's man in Germany, Gabriel Clarke, also seemed to be having a few problems with his microphone. Still, early days. \u00b7 It seems to be open season on Simon Heffer. A week after Monkey noted how the ginger whinger was being mocked in his old paper the Mail, Heffer's Telegraph colleague Craig Brown (who greeted his arrival at the Torygraph by inventing a columnist called William Bunter, 'Frank, Forceful and Fat') switches from indirect to direct parody by sending him up as preposterously verbose in Private Eye. You almost start to feel sorry for the testy Thatcherite. Almost. \u00b7 Never let it be said the BBC doesn't care about the regions after it chose Norwich for its annual meet and greet next month. It is only a coincidence, of course, that in the year the BBC asks for its biggest-ever licence fee increase, the AGM will take place in one of the most hard-to-reach cities in the UK. Fine place as it is, the road network is abysmal, and the train journey from London takes almost as long as it does to get to Paris."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
