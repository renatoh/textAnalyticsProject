Jousting demands levels of athleticism, agility and equestrianism that make it an ideal candidate for the Olympics, English Heritage argues. The organisation has launched a campaign to get jousting recognised as an Olympic sport in time for Tokyo 2020. \u201cWe are being deadly serious,\u201d said Lucy Hutchings, English Heritage\u2019s head of projects. \u201cIt is an incredible spectator sport, a really fascinating thing to watch. The skill of the knight and the horses make it a great thing to witness \u2026 we absolutely believe it deserves its place at the Olympic table.\u201d English Heritage has held preliminary talks with the International Olympic Committee and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Equestre Internationale, and on Thursday it launches an online petition. Hutchings said the IOC was in the process of making the Olympic programme more flexible and bringing in a rule that allowed the host nation to make its own proposals for additional events. Tokyo has been considering skateboarding, climbing and surfing. \u201cIf skateboarding can be included then jousting has a good chance,\u201d said Hutchings. Dominic Sewell, English Heritage\u2019s jousting expert, agreed. \u201cGiven what sports have been submitted to the Olympics over the years, I don\u2019t think there is any reason that something which has been a sport for over a thousand years should not be considered. \u201cIf the sport organises itself, there is no reason why we could not be ready for Tokyo.\u201d Sewell said jousting, which requires \u201ca huge amount of skill and involves a daily training regime\u201d, ticked lots of Olympic boxes. \u201cYou have to be strong, not just physically but mentally, so you can sit fearlessly in your saddle, face your rival and offer yourself as a target.\u201d Just like dressage, it also requires an enormous amount of equestrian training. Horses must be persuaded to accept a rider dressed in 20kg of steel armour and to gallop at an opponent at speeds of up to 30mph. \u201cHorses being prey animals, they are naturally designed to run away from things, so to persuade it to run towards another large clanging thing at speed takes time,\u201d Sewell said. He added that jousting should be seen as England\u2019s first national sport. Jousting\u2019s heyday was in the 15th and 16th centuries, with Henry VIII one of its most famous advocates. Historians have recently speculated that the reason Henry became such a cruel and petty tyrant is that jousting injuries brought about a change in his personality. The Olympics have a history of accepting new sports, including beach volleyball in 1996, and golf and rugby sevens in Rio de Janeiro this year. Baseball was added in 1998 but taken out after 2008. English Heritage said jousting was a popular sport not only in England, and not only at the castles where it will this summer be organising jousting events. Tournaments were held from Belgium to New Zealand, it said, and jousting was recognised as a sport by a number of US states. It has been Maryland\u2019s official sport since 1962. English Heritage tournaments often feature knights from all over the world, said Hutchings, although she admitted skills were particularly high in the UK. \u201cWe\u2019d have a very good chance of doing well [in the Olympics], I think.\u201d The petition was launched as Team GB prepares to head to this year\u2019s games in Rio. Anyone who cannot wait until Tokyo 2020 to watch some jousting should go to Framlingham Castle in Suffolk this weekend. Other events will take place later in the summer at Pendennis Castle in Cornwall, Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight and Bolsover Castle in Derbyshire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
