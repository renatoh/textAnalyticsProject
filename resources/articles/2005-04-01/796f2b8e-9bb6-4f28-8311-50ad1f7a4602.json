The tide may be turning for Michael Owen at Real Madrid after he made a telling contribution to his side's 4-2 victory over their rivals Barcelona on Sunday night. Fans at the Bernabeu got a rare chance to see Owen start a game for Real and he obliged with his 11th league goal of the season. \"It was a great feeling to score,\" said Owen \"It was one of the best matches I've been involved in.\" A week ago Owen's lack of chances in Real's starting line-up prompted speculation that he would have to return to English football to keep his place in the national team. But the decision of the Real coach Vanderlei Luxembourgo to employ an attacking formation including Ronaldo, Raul and Owen gave the former Liverpool forward a opportunity to shine in the most high profile game in La Liga . \"It's great to play in and to win the big derby match - coming over to Spain and doing that is a fantastic thing to have under my belt.\" Owen is just two league goals behind Ronaldo in the Madrid scoring charts and he added: \"I'd say there have been more ups than downs this season. I'm very pleased with the start I have made. It's not bad considering when I came there were people who were saying I was fourth choice [striker]. There is still a lot of negative stuff that surrounds me in Madrid but I'm baffled by it to be honest\" After Sunday night's performance, which puts Real six points behind the league leaders Barcelona with seven matches remaining, Owen was understandably positive about his prospects in Spain. \"I do feel involved. I get on with everyone better than I did in the first weeks because I was too nervous to talk to anyone.\" \u00b7 Seville will take legal action to have their defender Javi Navarro's five-match ban lifted, the Spanish club said in a statement yesterday. Navarro was banned by the Spanish Football Federation last week after the governing body judged that his collision with Real Mallorca's Venezualan forward Juan Arango, during a league match on March 20, was \"violent play\". Arango was knocked unconscious in a challenge, suffering a broken right cheekbone and required 40 stitches to a face wound. \u00b7 The Italian government yesterday threatened to close some stadiums after a total of 85 policemen were injured in clashes with fans across the country at the weekend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
