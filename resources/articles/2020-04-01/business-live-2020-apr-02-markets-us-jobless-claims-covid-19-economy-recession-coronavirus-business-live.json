Russia poured cold water on the details, saying there had been no deal, but it still put oil futures prices on track for the biggest daily rise ever. At the time of writing Brent crude futures prices had gained 22%. Here are the other important developments from today: More than 6.6m Americans filed jobless claims last week, by far the largest number in history and an indication that unemployment could reach a record high. Economists said it was one of the starkest indications yet of the scale of the economic pain already inflicted on the US. In the UK, the experimental data from the Office for National Statistics said that a quarter of UK companies are already cutting staffing levels \u201cin the short term\u201d due to the coronavirus crisis. British Airways confirmed that it will cut capacity by 90% year-on-year for April and May and furlough 30,000 cabin crew. British Gas owner Centrica has joined the ranks of companies cancelling their dividends. It also announced \u00a3400m in spending cuts this morning. National Express cancelled all of its services across the UK. And of course you can continue to follow all of our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. In the UK, health secretary Matt Hancock says the government has written off \u00a313.4bn of historic NHS debt: In the US, New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the state only has enough ventilators in its stockpile to last another six days: And in our global coverage, cases worldwide are reaching the 1m mark: Thank you for reading. Join us tomorrow for more live coverage of economics, business and markets. JJ BT staff are angry that the company is pressing ahead with plans to make around 40 Openreach employees redundant at the end of April as part of a restructuring programme. Workers and the Prospect union are calling on the company to delay the redundancies, given the current pause in the jobs market, within the company and nationally. One of the affected team said: I feel like there is a moral obligation on a company like BT to give us more time to find another role, we\u2019re not asking for them to reverse the decision. Lots of the team have worked for BT for 20-30 years. The team were first told in March that they would be made redundant. John Ferrett, Prospect national secretary, called BT\u2019s response \u201ctone deaf\u201d. He added it is \u201cinexcusable in the context of a wider economy that has effectively shut down.\u201d An Openreach spokesperson said that the redundancies have nothing to do with Covid-19, and out of the 42 people affected, four have accepted new roles and a further four have chosen to take \u201can enhanced voluntary redundancy leaver package\u201d. They said: The business is still actively recruiting internally for roles within Openreach and across BT Group, and we\u2019re hopeful that a similar outcome can be achieved for the remainder over the next month as we continue the consultation process with unions and employee representatives. The company denies that the recruitment process for internal roles has been frozen due to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. We\u2019ve been waiting all day for an announcement from British Airways. The Unite union has put out a statement, saying a deal has been struck, after the two sides had been negotiating for more than a week. According to the union, the carrier is to suspend 28,000 staff, from cabin crew to ground staff, engineers and head office employees, because of the coronavirus pandemic. Unite says BA will introduce a modified version of the government\u2019s job retention scheme and staff put on furlough will receive 80% of pay, but there will be no cap on earnings. Workers will be able to divert their pension contributions, worth between 9% and 18% of earnings, into their pay for a short period of time. There will be no unpaid temporary layoffs and no redundancies, and the redundancy process that had already begun has been halted. At Gatwick and London City airport, all BA staff will be suspended after the airline stopped flying to and from both airports until the end of the virus crisis. It is still running services at Heathrow. The airline employs 45,000 people in total, and has struck a separate deal with its 4,500 pilots, who will take two weeks\u2019 unpaid leave in both April and May. Oil prices are really volatile. Iraq, another member of Opec alongside Saudi Arabia, has said it backs fellow member Saudi Arabia\u2019s call for a meeting to discuss \u201cbalancing\u201d the market. Brent crude futures prices are up above $30.50. That\u2019s a 23% gain today. West Texas Intermediate, the North American benchmark, is trading at $25.33 - an increase of more than $5 today. That translates to a 24% daily rise. It\u2019s swinging by whole percentage points at a time though. Production at Nissan\u2019s Sunderland factory, the country\u2019s biggest car plant, (and a totemic part of the Brexit debate) is suspended throughout April. That continues a shutdown in place since mid-March as the coronavirus outbreak continues across Europe. Reuters reports: \u201cDuring this period the majority of plant employees will be furloughed,\u201d the company said, referring to a government scheme covering 80% of wage costs for staff placed on temporary leave, up to 2,500 pounds ($3,100) a month per employee. Nissan\u2019s sites in Spain are also suspended until further notice, the Japanese carmaker said. Some of the broadcasters with the biggest global reach have donated advertising space for public health information. Here\u2019s the info from the Guardian\u2019s Mark Sweney: Amid that excitement, European stock markets limped to a close, despite the boost to the share prices of their oil producers. The FTSE 100 gained 0.47% to hit 5,480.22 points. Germany\u2019s Dax increased by 0.27%, while France\u2019s Cac 40 gained 0.33%. There is some understandable scepticism around Trump\u2019s claim of a deal between Russia and Saudi Arabia. A production cut of 10m barrels per day would be an enormous - equivalent to nearly half of the two countries\u2019 output. Multiple outlets have reported that Russian president Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman have not spoken about any deal. This is from the Financial Times: After Mr Trump\u2019s tweet, which appeared to be an attempt to corner Russia into agreeing to resume talks with the Kingdom, Mr Peskov told the FT: \u201cthere was no conversation\u201d between Mr Putin and Prince Mohammed. If oil prices remain at these levels until the end of the day it would represent the biggest one-day move in the careers of anyone in the industry. This table shows the data going back to 1965 for Brent crude oil futures, the North Sea benchmark. As you can see, there hasn\u2019t been a bigger daily move than 14.61% - and I believe that is a record for the contract. That move in 2019 came when Saudi Arabian oil facilities were attacked. Such a big move on the oil markets in such a short time is highly unusual. A lot of people will have made an awful lot of money. Not least investors in the FTSE 100\u2019s oil companies. Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s two listings on the London Stock Exchange have both gained about 10%, while BP has gained 6.4%. One of the ironies of the situation though is that low oil prices can act as something of a cushion for struggling economies that still need fuel for transport. But it appears that Trump\u2019s concern may be to protect jobs in the US oil industry. Saudi Arabia is calling for a meeting of Opec, the cartel of oil producers, and other producers such as Russia to discuss \u201crestoring balance\u201d to the oil market. Here are the announcements via the Saudi Press Agency: The output cut could be as high as 15m barrels, Trump adds in another tweet. The US president seems to enjoy watching his tweets move markets. Here is the movement in Brent crude futures prices over the past 10 days. As you can see, Trump\u2019s tweet has been the biggest market mover over that period. Prices jumped from just over $26 per barrel to above $36 per barrel in the space of minutes. It has since calmed somewhat, back down to about $30 per barrel - but that\u2019s still a huge move of 24% for the day. Oil prices are soaring after US President Donald Trump said that Russia and Saudi Arabia have agreed to cut production. He expects a cut of 10m barrels, and possibly more, which would push prices up after a brutal selloff. Brent crude oil futures prices have jumped by as much as 30%. Here\u2019s the tweet: More details to come. If all of the people who have filed for US jobless support in the last two weeks then that would mean the unemployment rate would hit 10% in April - already higher than the financial crisis as the previous chart shows. By the time of the April payroll survey week Capital Economics estimates that 15m Americans will have filed a claim. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at the consultancy, said: The upshot is that our seemingly super-bearish forecast that the unemployment rate would peak at 12.5%, as 14m people lost their jobs, is now looking a little optimistic. Our forecast that second-quarter GDP will slump by 40% annualised is still one of the most bearish in the market \u2013 but in light of this degree of devastation in the labour market, we suspect that other forecasters will be moving more into line with us. Jasper Jolly here, taking over from Graeme Wearden until the European market close. More horrified reaction to the US jobless figures, from UK economists Stephen King and Gavyn Davies: Fears of a surge in unemployment spurred US politicians to approve a $2trn stimulus package last month. It includes checks for less wealthy families, and hundreds of billions of loans for large firms and small companies - including support to help them pay furloughed workers. However, CNN reports there are problems getting those big commitments into the real economy. Officials involved with implementing the legislation say federal agencies are staffing up, issuing guidance and working around the clock to prepare to disburse money quickly, but glitches in technology, delays and staffing and resource shortages are almost inevitable given the sheer size of the country\u2019s largest-ever stimulus package. \u201cThis is a national consequence of passing a $2 trillion bill in two weeks,\u201d one person familiar with the implementation told CNN on background in order to speak freely about what they are hearing. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we know all the implementation issues yet.\u201d In another blow, a survey of business conditions in the New York state region has tumbled: The record surge in US jobless claims has worried investors - and reminded them that the world economy is entering a dangerous slump. Hopes of a rebound rally on Wall Street have fizzled out, with the Dow Jones industrial average currently down 49 points or 0.24% at 20,893. In London, the FTSE 100 is down 41 points or 0.7% at 5413. Today\u2019s US jobless claims report was worst than the more dire forecasts. That\u2019s a bad sign. Usually, economists make a range of informed estimates, which gives us a median prediction. Now, sometimes that average doesn\u2019t prove too accurate. But it\u2019s unusual for even the gloomiest forecast to undershoot reality. John Forsythe, of global institutional asset manager BrightSphere Investment Group, says people appear to be struggling to gauge exactly what\u2019s happening in the economy. \u201cToday\u2019s jobless claims report is troubling not just because it was record-breaking but also because it easily exceeded pessimistic consensus estimates. This is disconcerting because it indicates that after a month in crisis, U.S. businesses and investors are still struggling to discern the basic contours of the economic fallout of coronavirus pandemic. Economic data come in many forms. Good, mediocre, bad, and then occasionally so awful that you can\u2019t quite believe it\u2019s true. Today\u2019s initial jobless claims fall squarely into the last category. As Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, puts it: \u201cToday\u2019s US jobless claims figure has a strong claim to being quite literally the worst single economic data release of all time, in terms of its significance for both the US economy and global markets.\u201d Labor economist Heidi Shierholz has described today\u2019s unemployment report as a \u2018portrait of disaster\u2019. She also points out that some people who lost their jobs won\u2019t be counted in today\u2019s figures (as they don\u2019t qualify for support). Shierholz, who served as chief economist to the U.S. Secretary of Labor under Barack Obama\u2019s administration, fears that Covid-19 could eventually put 20 million Americans out of work [out of a labor force of over 164m, I think]. Nearly 10 million Americans lost their jobs in the last two weeks of March (today\u2019s 6.6m plus last week\u2019s 3.3m). It\u2019s simply astonishingly bad. Usually, the initial claims figure moves by a few thousand - it\u2019s been comfortably below 300,00 for many months. The previous spike, of 695,000, was set in 1982. Even during the great recession more than a decade ago, the worst single weak was 665,000 in March 2009. Here\u2019s my colleagues Dominic Rushe and Lauren Aratani on the dreadful US jobless claims report: More than 6.65 million people filed for unemployment benefits in the US last week, the latest official figures to highlight the devastating economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the American economy. As reports emerged of long lines at unemployment offices, jammed phone lines and broken websites across the US, the federal labor department said Thursday that a new record number of people sought benefits after losing their jobs in the week ending 27 March. Some 3.28 million had filed for unemployment the previous week, bringing total claims to 9.93 million for the two weeks. More people have filed for unemployment in the last two weeks than filed in the last six months. The US now faces the sharpest rise in unemployment in its history, a surge that is already highlighting income inequality across the nation and comes as the global economy goes into a nosedive that is likely to exacerbate the situation in the months ahead. \u201cWe are at the mercy of the virus,\u201d said William Rodgers, former chief economist at the US Department of Labor. Rodgers calculates US unemployment, just 3.5% in February, has already reached 17% in just two weeks and that rates for African Americans have soared to 19% from 5.8% More here: Josh Lipsky of the Atlantic Council says America\u2019s economy has come to a sudden stop, and millions of workers are the casualties: The White House and Capitol Hill need to act fast, he adds, or risk a repeat of the unemployment crisis of the 1930s. \u201cToday\u2019s jobs report underscores the historic devastation that is happening in America\u2019s labor market. To put it bluntly, the US economy went from full speed to full stop and millions of workers were not wearing seat belts. Across many communities and throughout small businesses the situation is growing more desperate by the day. We are beginning to see dangerous default rates in the mortgage markets. State officials are overwhelmed and unable to process unemployment claims. The phase 3 stimulus was much-needed temporary relief but phase 4 should come together rapidly in the hopes of avoiding a long-term joblessness situation akin to the Great Depression. Robert Alster, Head of Investment Services at wealth manager Close Brothers Asset Management, says Covid-19 is having a \u2018devastating\u2019 impact on America\u2019s economy: Here\u2019s his take on the shocking news that 6.6 million people applied for unemployment welfare last week. \u201cAnother record week for unemployment in the US confirms the worst fears of the Fed and the market alike. The impact Covid-19 is having on the service-led economy is devastating, with estimates of GDP contraction in Q2 as high as 34%. What\u2019s more, the unemployment figures are inevitably going to rise, as local labour offices process the backlog following a surge of new claims. The private nonfarm payrolls for March are expected to shrink for the first time in a decade. \u201cTo soften the impact, fiscal and monetary levers will need to be used in tandem, and speed is of the essence. The $2.2 trillion rescue package will help, but huge numbers of small and mid-size businesses will be looking to the treasury for further support. Similarly, consumers will benefit from the helicopter payments but are lacking the income support that we\u2019ve seen in the UK. Further questions arise over Federal independence; constitutional authority for public-health interventions lie primarily with the states, but any social or economic response needs to be co-ordinated or they risk failing. Now more than ever the Fed needs to be ready to take drastic measures in response to the data.\u201d Some snap reaction: The number of \u2018continued claims\u2019 for unemployment benefit has also soared, to 3.03 million people. That covers Americans who have been claiming jobless help for more than a week -- so includes the first wave of joblessness reported a week ago. The thought of 6.6 million Americans signing on for unemployment welfare in a single week is absolutely staggering. There\u2019s never been anything like it in recent economic history: NEWSFLASH: More than six million Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefit last week - a really terrible number. The initial jobless claims total soared to 6.648m for last week -- smashing even the highest estimate. That\u2019s up from 3.3 million initial claims in the previous week -- which was itself a huge record. Before Covid-19, the previous record was below 700,000 for any week. It shows clearly that the coronavirus pandemic, and the lockdowns imposed across America, are having a very, very serious impact on its economy. Unemployment is clearly soaring, hurting many millions of families across the country. More to follow..... Economists and investors around the world are bracing to discover how many Americans have lost their jobs since the Covid-19 pandemic struck. The initial claims report, due any moment at 8.30am East Coast time or 1.30pm in the UK, is expected to show that many millions of US citizens signed on last week. Goldman Sachs has hiked its forecast this morning, predicting that SIX MILLION people filed jobless claims. That would smash last week\u2019s record of 3.3m (which could be revised).... Ratings agency Fitch has warned that its \u2018basecase forecast\u2019 is now for a deep global recession this year. It now expects global economic activity to shrink by 1.9%, with the UK economy contracting by 3.9%: BT staff are angry that the company is pressing ahead with plans to make around 40 Openreach employees redundant at the end of April as part of a restructuring programme. Workers and the Prospect union are calling on the company to delay the redundancies, given the current pause in the jobs market, within the company and nationally. One of the affected team said: \u201cI feel like there is a moral obligation on a company like BT to give us more time to find another role, we\u2019re not asking for them to reverse the decision. Lots of the team have worked for BT for 20 - 30 years.\u201d The team were first told in March that they would be made redundant. John Ferrett, Prospect national secretary, called BT\u2019s response \u201ctone deaf\u201d. He added it is \u201cinexcusable in the context of a wider economy that has effectively shut down.\u201d Newsflash: National Express has announced it is fully suspending its national network of scheduled coach services across the UK from midnight on Sunday. The company says it can\u2019t keep operating, given the ongoing lockdown. Chris Hardy, managing director of National Express UK Coach, explains: \u201cWe kept a limited coach network running to be able to help those individuals with essential travel needs but it is no longer viable to continue to do this. \u201cPassenger numbers continue to fall as the public rightly follow government advice to avoid non-essential travel. The decision to temporarily suspend all services is the right one based on the current unprecedented circumstances and I hope our passengers understand this. \u201cIt is very clear that the critical thing we must do to protect our NHS and save lives is to stay at home. All journeys before Monday 6 April will be completed and we will ensure customers are not stranded but until further notice, we will not be running any service. Shares in National Express are down 7% today, and have lost 60% of their value this year. The drop in UK employment levels last week is a very bad sign -- with further job cuts inevitable as the coronavirus crisis deepens. So says Nye Cominetti, Senior Economist at the Resolution Foundation: \u201cThe coronavirus-induced lockdown is having a profound impact on working families, with new ONS data showing that over a quarter of businesses have cut hours or jobs in recent weeks. This helps to explain why almost a million people have made a Universal Credit claim in the past fortnight. We have never seen this before. \u201cWith almost half of firms saying that they have been impacted negatively by the crisis, we can expect further job losses in the near future. \u201cThe government\u2019s welcome Coronavirus Job Retention scheme will make a big difference to some workers who may have otherwise lost jobs. But huge numbers of people are still going to be facing big income hits, and difficult times lie ahead for many. It\u2019s essential that Universal Credit is able to deliver for those who will desperately need help over the coming months.\u201d Supermarket chain Morrisons has announced its tripling its bonus for UK staff this year. Following the surge in demand from shoppers, all frontline workers will receive a 6% bonus on their earnings for the next 12 months (corrected). The changes will mean a bonus payment of \u00a31,050 for a full-time frontline colleague compared to the \u00a3351 average last year, Morrisons says. Encouragingly, staff will still be eligible for the payment if they\u2019re ill or self-isolating. The ONS\u2019s new coronavirus-impact report shows that online prices rose by 1.1% last week. That may not sound much, but it\u2019s actually a steep increase -- the UK\u2019s inflation target is for the cost of living to rise 2% over a year. Brompton aren\u2019t the only people helping NHS staff cycle to work (see earlier post). The Bike Club, which rents out cycles, is offering London-based frontline workers free membership for the next couple of months. That could help vital staff avoid catching viruses on the underground. Unions representing airline workers fear many more jobs will be cut unless the government helps the airline sector. Prospect are urging ministers to heed pressure to aid companies such as Virgin Atlantic (which is seeking a state bailout), to help the wider UK aviation industry. Garry Graham, Prospect deputy general secretary, fears that governments won\u2019t act, because airlines are owned, run or founded by some famous millionaires or billionaires - for whom public sympathy is rather thin: \u201cThe aviation industry is fighting for its survival. That means a million jobs, skills, vital regional, national and international connectivity, and the future of the economy are at risk if the government doesn\u2019t intervene. \u201cIt is wholly unacceptable for ministers to glibly reference shareholders and a couple of unscrupulous owners as reason not to come to the industry\u2019s rescue. Perception is important and when you equate a whole industry to two or three individuals you completely dehumanise the hundreds of thousands of workers who could lose their jobs. Those workers deserve as much consideration as any other workers at this terrible time. \u201cThis is not just about perception though, it\u2019s about a pragmatic regard for the future of the economy. If we have any chance of rebounding from this catastrophe then this industry which is critical to commerce and tourism, needs to be ready to restart as soon as possible. That means infrastructure, workforce capacity, workers themselves and their skills base, all need to be preserved. \u201cHowever you feel about Branson, Stelios or O\u2019Leary it is their workers and the whole economy that will pay the price if the government ignores this industry.\u201d The jump in paracetamol pricing (2.8% last week) follows a shortage of raw materials. We reported earlier this month that wholesale prices for pain relief had spiked, forcing retailers to either push up their prices or take the hit. You can read the ONS\u2019s new data on the UK economy here: Coronavirus, the UK economy and society, faster indicators: data as at 2 April 2020 The Office for National Statistics has also found a sharp jump in prices charged online for cough and cold medicine last week. Average online prices surged 10% between 16-22 March and 23-30 March, suggesting some retailers took advantage of rising demand (despite official warnings not to price gouge). Antibacterial wipes got cheaper though: Newsflash: A quarter of UK companies are already cutting staffing levels \u201cin the short term\u201d due to the coronavirus crisis. That\u2019s according to a new survey of the British economy from the Office for National Statistics. These new \u2018experimental statistics\u2019 are an attempt to spot trends quickly in the UK economy. They confirm that the virus is having a dramatic impact on the British labour market (as was shown by the huge jump in Universal credit claims too). Here\u2019s the key findings: Of those 3,642 businesses who responded to the Business Impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Survey (BICS), 45% reported turnover that was \u201clower than expected\u201d for the period 9 to 22 March 2020. Over a quarter (27%) of responding businesses said they were reducing staff levels in the short term, while 5% reported recruiting staff in the short term. Almost half (46%) of businesses who responded said that they had encouraged their staff had to work from home in the period 9 March to 22 March 2020. The majority of responding businesses reported that the prices they buy and sell at were stable, with 68% of businesses who responded reporting no change to their selling prices and 63% reporting that the costs of buying goods and services generally stayed the same in the period 9 March to 22 March 2020. For those businesses that responded where importing and exporting were applicable, 57% of importers and 59% of exporters reported that trade had been affected by COVID-19. Overall, online prices of items in the high-demand products (HDPs) basket have increased by 1.1% over the period week 1 (16 to 22 March) to week 2 (23 to 29 March). Over the same period, most items in the basket saw modest price changes, with 13 out of the 22 items showing price changes between negative 1.0% and positive 1.0%. In the week commencing 16 March 2020, both unique shipping visits and total shipping visits increased on a UK level, but some large UK ports saw decreases in unique visits in this period. Pets at Home has been deluged with demand since the Covid-19 crisis began. The company, which supplies doggie chews, rabbit food, hutches, cages, bedding, vets services and cuddly animals themselves, has reported a surge in orders last month. It has now raised its profit forecast for the current year, saying: In the closing weeks of the financial year we have, however, experienced exceptional levels of demand, both in-store and online, as the COVID-19 crisis has developed, and have seen existing customers increase average basket size by pulling forward purchases as well as new customers access our pet products and healthcare services. Pets at Home was classified as an \u2018essential retailer\u2019 by the government, meaning its shops can stay open. But in a concession to the coronavirus emergency it has closed its Groom Room salons, so Britain\u2019s pets may soon look as shaggy-haired as their owners.... You currently have to queue just to get onto Pets At Home\u2019s website, as people try to stock up on key items for their furry or feathered friends. CEO Peter Pritchard says the firm is working \u201ctirelessly\u201d to help families through the crisis, adding: We are also providing support for the communities that need us through \u00a31.1m of funding to nominated pet charities, a \u00a31m crisis fund for colleagues and discounts to NHS workers as they care for the nation\u2019s health. UK energy provider Centrica has joined the (swelling) ranks of companies cancelling their dividends. Centrica has decided not to pay its 2019 dividend, and also announced \u00a3400m in spending cuts this morning, after being hit by Covid-19. The company, which owns British Gas, has also withdrawn management bonuses. The covonavirus outbreak has hurt demand for gas from business customers, as many have temporarily shut down. Domestic demand has risen, but so have bad debt as people and businesses struggle to pay bills. This has forced Centrica to withdraw its financial guidance for year, warning that: We also expect to see an increase in working capital outflows and customer bad debt, as certain customer segments defer payments due to the reduction of household incomes and business revenues. Centrica says it is doing its bit to help: We are following all advice from government and relevant health organisations, and as a consequence we have stopped all non-essential customer visits to minimise contact. However, our service engineers will continue to attend breakdowns, and across the business we will remain available to all our customers, whilst prioritising those who are vulnerable and may need additional support over the coming weeks. We have several hundred UK service engineers who have volunteered to perform essential service visits to customers\u2019 homes even where there may be higher risk of Covid-19, to ensure they have continued access to heat, hot water and electricity. The oil price is surging this morning, after Donald Trump suggested that Saudi Arabia and Russia could end their price war. Last night, the US president told reporters that: \u201cI have confidence in both that they\u2019ll be able to work it out,\u201d It\u2019s nearly a month since Saudi Arabia boosted its oil output by several million barrels per day, after Moscow refused to back an Opec-led production cuts plan. That sent crude reeling to 17-year lows. But this morning, Brent crude has leapt to $27 per barrel, from $25.45 last night. European stock markets have opened higher, shaking off some of Wednesday\u2019s sharp losses. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 45 points, or 0.8%, having lost over 200 points yesterday. Energy companies are leading the rally, as oil prices surge back from their 17-year lows (more on this in a moment...) That lifts the index back to 5500. A couple of weeks ago Brompton Bicycle offered to lend 200 folding bikes to NHS staff at two London hospitals, free of charge, to help them get to work without having to risk infection on public transport. Today, the company says it has been overwhelmed, with 500 healthcare workers signing up. It doesn\u2019t have enough bikes to meet demand, so Brompton is now unveiling a \u201cWheels for Heroes\u201d plan to increase the number available to 1,000. Via a combination of crowdfunding and the loan of company resources worth \u00a3100,000, the company will ramp up production and make the bikes available for as long as lockdown continues. Anyone who wants to help fund bikes for the NHS can do so here. In the UK, British Airways is expected to announce it will suspend tens of thousands of staff because of the coronavirus pandemic. This would cover cabin crew, ground staff, engineers and head office employees, as BA reels from a slump in demand. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: The airline, which grounded its planes at Gatwick airport earlier this week, has been negotiating with the Unite union for more than a week. The two sides have reached a broad agreement but still need to hammer out some details, the BBC reported. A BA spokesperson said: \u201cTalks continue.\u201d Under the agreement, up to 80% of BA employees will be placed on furlough, but no one will be made redundant. The airline industry is feeling the full heat of the Covid-19 crisis. So with planes grounded worldwide, manufacturing giant Boeing is reportedly offering voluntary layoffs to employees. Reuters has the story: Boeing is set to offer buyout and early retirement packages to employees, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, a bid to mitigate the financial fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Boeing was initiating a voluntary layoff plan that allows eligible employees who want to exit the company to do so with a pay and benefits package, one of the people said. Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun is expected to detail a voluntary layoff plan in a memo to employees as early as Thursday, the second person said. Reuters predicts that the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits likely shot to a record high for a second week in a row: \u201cThe U.S. labor market is in free-fall,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. \u201cThe prospect of more stringent lockdown measures and the fact that many states have not yet been able to process the full amount of jobless claim applications suggest the worst is still to come.\u201d Initial claims for state unemployment benefits probably raced to a seasonally adjusted 3.50 million for the week ended March 28, according to a Reuters survey of economists. Estimates in the survey were as high as 5.25 million. Bloomberg agrees, pointing out that today\u2019s figure will include people who couldn\u2019t be counted in last week\u2019s total. The highest estimate for today\u2019s data is a staggering 6.5 million, they add: The claims report \u201cwill likely reflect both newly laid-off workers as well as states catching up on previously filed claims that had not yet been captured in the system due to overwhelming demand,\u201d Wells Fargo economist Sam Bullard wrote in a note While Friday\u2019s payroll figures are forecast to show a more-modest decline in jobs in March, they reflect data from earlier in the month before most virus-related shutdowns. So, the bigger job losses -- and an unemployment rate potentially rising by several percentage points -- are more likely to show up in the April data due in May. The most dire prediction puts the figure at 6.5 million -- the forecast of Thomas Costerg at Pictet Wealth Management -- while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates 5.25 million and Citigroup is at 4 million. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With the Covid-19 downturn in full swing, unemployment is spiking in America and Europe. Across factories, offices, shops, pubs and restaurants, people are being \u2018furloughed\u2019 where possible or simply laid off. Today we learn how many Americans filed jobless benefits claims last week, and experts fears it will smash the previous week\u2019s record levels. Economists predict that today\u2019s initial jobless claims figure will hit 3.5 million -- a new record, up from the 3.3 million reported a week ago. The previous record was below 700,000 people, so the sudden shutdown of America\u2019s economy is quite unprecedented. Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada predicts that four million Americans filed unemployment claims last week -- and that the previous week\u2019s record could be revised higher too! Last week\u2019s print of just under 3.5 million is ripe for a dramatic upward revision. In particular, our US economists point out that despite California having reportedly seen one million claims through that week (according to the governor), less than 200k showed up in the number. For this week, we are looking for another sizeable 4 million increase. Joblessness is accelerating sharply in the UK too. Last night, the government revealed that nearly a million people applied for Universal Credit last week - an astonishing surge, showing how badly families across the country have been hit. The global Covid-19 case total is now approaching one million, putting a very serious strain on health systems worldwide (one major UK hospital nearly ran out of oxygen last week, we report). Medical experts insist that lockdowns, physical distancing and social isolation are the only way to beat the virus. That is going to mean a serious hit to economic growth (although letting coronavirus run riot, overwhelming the system, would hardly be better!). Shares fell sharply in Europe and America yesterday, with indices down around 4%, on fears of a deep Covid-19 recession. Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp, says hopes of a rapid recovery have faded: With the global economy in freefall, markets have gone back to risk-off mode overnight as investors are struggling to look through President Trump\u2019s ominous forecast suggesting Americans could keep dying into June. Now the markets dispute to come up with some alphabet letters to analogize a potential economic recovery. Still, it\u2019s going to be anything but a \u201cV\u201d shape recovery. That\u2019s for sure. The agenda 1.30pm BST: US weekly jobless data 3pm BST: US durable goods orders for February"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
