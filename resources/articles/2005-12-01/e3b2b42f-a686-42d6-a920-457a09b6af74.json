Elliott White, 24, had burst into Mr Monckton's home in Chelsea, west London, with his childhood friend Damien Hanson, also 24, who was convicted of murder yesterday. Mr Monckton was stabbed several times as he struggled with the raiders. Blood from White, of Shepherd's Bush, west London, was found at the scene of the murder and bungled robbery at the house, in Upper Cheyne Row. White had admitted robbery, telling police immediately after his arrest that he had been at Mr Mockton's home. However, he had denied murder and the attempted murder of Mr Monckton's wife, Homeyra, who was stabbed twice in the back during the raid. She lost seven pints of blood, and her life was saved by emergency services. The jury is still considering whether White attempted to murder 46-year-old Mrs Monckton. The judge, Mr Justice Calvert-Smith, read a note from the jury requesting \"further directions\". Soon afterwards, the jurors were sent home. They will resume deliberations on Monday. White appeared to utter a silent prayer in the dock before the jury's verdict. When found not guilty of murder he threw his head back and closed his eyes. Hanson, a career criminal who was obsessed with the rich, was also convicted of robbery and attempting to kill Mrs Monckton yesterday. White and Hanson had tricked 49-year-old Mr Monckton into opening the front door of his \u00a33m home - which the trial heard had \"fortress-like\" security - by pretending there was a package for him. White had dressed like a postal worker and Hanson, wearing a balaclava and carrying a gun and knife, hid behind him. As Mr Monckton opened the door, the two men burst inside. Hanson killed Mr Monckton three months after being released from prison having served only seven years of a 12-year sentence for attempted murder. He had previous convictions for burglary, unlawful wounding and attempted burglary, the jury was told. It is understood the Home Office will carry out an investigation into the early release of prisoners following the murder of Mr Monckton, who worked for Legal &amp; General. In court, Hanson claimed he had not been on the robbery and that White had tried to frame him. He said he had been visiting his sister in Brixton, south London, but the jury rejected his alibi. Under cross-examination, Hanson was accused of being a liar by both White's counsel and the prosecution. White's counsel, Courtney Griffiths QC, said Hanson displayed \"psychopathic tendencies\". During the trial, it emerged that White's mother had labelled Hanson \"666, Damien the devil's child\". The Moncktons' nine-year-old daughter Isobel, who was upstairs when the raid began, witnessed part of the attack and alerted police after the raiders had fled."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
