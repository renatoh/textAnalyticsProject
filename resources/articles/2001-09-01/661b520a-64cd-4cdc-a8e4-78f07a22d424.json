One of the photographs in the programme is a full-page, full-colour close-up of a cockroach, and that just about encapsulates the way humanity is portrayed in this staging - sadistic, amoral and utterly self-serving, with no redeeming features at all. It's obvious from the sexual anarchy of the opening scene that this Duke of Mantua runs a court from which any vestige of a moral code has long been erased. When the curtain goes up, an orgy is in full swing, in which the exchange of partners appears to be arbitrary and sometimes violent. Rigoletto, propelling himself around on a pair of crutches and looking for all the world like that cockroach, is clearly playing his full sadistic part in all of this. When, in the second scene, he returns to his house and daughter, claiming to have left his court persona and intriguing behind him, his words ring even more hollow than usual. The onward creep of the tragedy has already started and, from that point, is unstoppable. Events such as kidnap and murder are clearly everyday happenings in this morally bankrupt world, which is strikingly evoked in Michael Vale's set, enclosed by crumbling walls and tellingly lit by Paule Constable. It is a tilted facade, whose obverse provides the seedy, faded backdrop to the ducal court, but which revolves to reveal a tangle of corrugated metal, wire netting and rickety stairs - the interiors of Rigoletto's house and Sparafucile's inn. The cast responds to McVicar's and Vale's bleak vision and to the alert, observant conducting of Edward Downes (celebrating his 50th year with the Royal Opera) with performances of high-tension involvement. Even the Covent Garden audience, which had blithely chatted through the opening prelude, was stilled to silence by the time of Rigoletto's first meeting with the assassin Sparafucile, clearly defined as the pivot on which the drama turns. Paolo Gavanelli's Rigoletto is firm-toned and visually compelling, although he was out of tune just a bit too often for comfort; Eric Halfvarson's Sparafucile is sinisterly restrained and perfectly focused. If Christine Sch\u00e4fer's Gilda is the problematic portrayal, vocally competent but played as a pallid waif lacking real musical or dramatic personality, then Marcelo Alvarez's dashingly sung Duke steals the show. He personifies the repellent world of this opera - brash, predatory and rotten to the core. \u0095 Until October 8. Box office: 020-7304 4000. The opera will be broadcast on BBC2 and Radio 3 tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false}}}
