The case, potentially Britain's biggest class action to date, suffered what could be a fatal blow when a judge ruled yesterday that shareholders must pay \u00a32.25m into court to cover the government's costs in the event of their defeat. Leaders of the Railtrack private shareholders' action group admitted they had insufficient money and that the decision was likely to mean the end of their three-year battle unless a \"white knight\" offered cash to top up their coffers. Group members will lose their average donations of \u00a350, which will be swallowed up by legal and administrative costs. Investors had accused former transport secretary Stephen Byers of misfeasance in public office over his controversial move in putting Railtrack into administration in 2001. They insist the firm was solvent and that his actions amounted to renationalisation without full compensation. The case was brought in the name of a single shareholder, Geoffrey Weir, who said: \"This is a very disappointing outcome and it could be the end of our claim.\" Committee members will meet tonight to discuss whether to surrender. Mr Weir said the judge's ruling made it difficult for any group of citizens to challenge the government, as the amount needed to cover a possible defeat was out of reach: \"We did jolly well raising the money we have, but it's a very unfair playing field. \"The government have bottomless resources and can spend what they like - including hiring one of the country's top QCs.\" A misfeasance trial would have been an embarrassment for the government. Likely witnesses included Mr Byers, his former special advisers Dan Corry and Jo Moore, the former rail regulator Tom Winsor and Railtrack's then chairman, John Robinson. The action group was formed by a middle-ranking Railtrack executive, Andrew Chalklen, who urged shareholders to donate 10p for every share they held. The group recruited law firm Edwin Coe and a leading barrister, Michael Crystal QC. The group's fighting fund peaked at \u00a32.4m but it has already spent \u00a3200,000, and if it gives up today it will be liable for the government's costs to date of \u00a31.5m. Advisers to the group said that unless a benefactor came forward, all 55,000 supporters would have to donate between \u00a340 and \u00a350 to proceed to a full hearing. If the case is withdrawn, critics are likely to question the group's wisdom in persuading grassroots investors to pump funds into such an action. The Department for Transport declined to comment yesterday, but the government has previously defended Mr Byers' actions by pointing out that shareholders ended up with a cash settlement of 250p a share - not far short of the 280p at which the company was put into administration. Railtrack was ultimately replaced by Network Rail, the not-for-dividend company."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
