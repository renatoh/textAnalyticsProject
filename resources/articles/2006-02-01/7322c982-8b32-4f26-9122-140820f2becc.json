And in one of the first marketing efforts to use Google's map technology, HBO would like to show you exactly where those are,\" says The New York Times. \"To promote their upcoming season of The Sopranos, HBO, a division of Time Warner, and Deep Focus, an online marketing agency, have created an interactive map of New Jersey, using satellite maps from Google, and have highlighted important points of the most recent season's storyline. The map has about 15 icons in specific areas where scenes took place. When the user clicks on an icon, the scene plays in a pop-up window, which also supplies a description and a list of characters.\" Comment: Don't look now. The maps go live on February 27."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
