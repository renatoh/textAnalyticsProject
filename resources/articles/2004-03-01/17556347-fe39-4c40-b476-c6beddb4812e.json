Under the scheme being introduced by the Inland Revenue, footballers, rugby players and other professionals will be prevented from receiving a quarter of their pensions tax-free at the age of 35 as had previously been the case. The new rules mean sports stars will now have to wait until they are at least 55 before receiving their total pensions and Taylor was told by the Treasury that special exemptions cannot be made. Undeterred, Taylor has vowed to continue the campaign, claiming that sports stars, many of whom retire in their 30s, should be treated as a extraordinary case and he is being supported in that view by the Institute of Professional Sport."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
