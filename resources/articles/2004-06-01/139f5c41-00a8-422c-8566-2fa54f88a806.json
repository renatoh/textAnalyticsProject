Get a spare pair of socks", "bodyText": "England's quest for European glory may have suffered a setback because there may not be enough room in David Beckham's customised boots to accommodate an extra pair of socks. Beckham, Francesco Totti and other players in Portugal have complained about blisters caused by the heat and hard grounds. They have been told that the best way to combat them is to wear an extra pair of socks under their football socks when playing. Beckham was unable to train on Tuesday because of blisters and Totti blamed them for his lacklustre performance in Italy's match against Denmark on Monday. Adidas and Nike, who between them supply boots to all the tournament's major players, consulted foot specialists, who came up with the extra socks solution. But Adidas has revealed that Beckham may have problems because his Predator Pulse boots are made exactly to his 8 foot size. An Adidas spokesman said: \"We are not sure if there will be enough room for an extra pair of socks because Beckham's boots are made to an exact size. You can't buy that size in sports shops but the final decision is up to Beckham if he wants to wear an extra pair of socks. We have a situation where there is heat, the ground is hard and players are wearing hard studs. It's causing blisters for some of them, not all of them.\" Players such as Beckham and Totti are wearing boots with new colours specially issued for the European Championship, which are tougher on feet than well-worn boots. Totti's problem with blisters became so severe that he was forced to change a new pair of Nike Air Zoom boots he was wearing for an old pair at half-time against Denmark. Nike claimed that Totti's boots had nothing to do with his blisters. A spokesman said: \"Totti changed back into an old pair of boots for the second half [against Denmark]. Heat build-up causes blisters so Totti is going to be wearing a pair of cotton socks under his football socks for the next match. As for his boots, that model has been out since February, we have hundreds of players around Europe wearing them and around 40 players wearing them in Portugal without any problems. Totti was wearing a specially coloured pair for this tournament.\" Beckham is the only player at the tournament wearing specially made boots for each match. His hand-stitched Predator boots not only contain his own special logo but the date of the match, a cross of St George and the flag of the opposing team. Adidas said Beckham has only six pairs of boots for England's group matches: three pairs for hard ground, three for soft. If England qualify for the quarter-finals, four pairs of boots will be specially flown in from Adidas headquarters in Bavaria. A spokesman for the company said: \"We have somebody on standby who will be responsible for putting the match details into Beckham's boots and then taking them to Portugal. He's flown all over the world ensuring that Beckham gets his boots.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
