The Little Britain star has become one of the fastest-selling authors in the UK, with more than 20,000 books a week flying off the shelves. In previous years he was in the running for the prize with The Boy in the Dress and Mr Stink, both illustrated by Quentin Blake, the former children's laureate who worked with Dahl from 1975 until the author's death in 1990. He faces fierce competition in the seven-14 category, not least from Frank Cottrell Boyce, who is currently feted for the script he wrote for the Olympics opening ceremony, directed by Danny Boyle. He's in the running with Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Flies Again, his follow-up to Ian Fleming's classic novel about a flying car. It's another contender with a Dahl connection, though rather more tangential \u2013 the film script for the 1968 musical of Fleming's book was co-written by Roald Dahl. Also shortlisted in the older readers category are a debut novel described as \"Adrian Mole meets the Inbetweeners\" \u2013 Socks are Not Enough by Mark Lowery; Goblins by the author of the award-winning Mortal Engines series, Philip Reeve; The Dragonsitter by Josh Lacey, who also writes the GRK books under the name Joshua Doder; and Dark Lord: Teenage Years by Jamie Thomson. The picturebooks category for readers 0-6 has taken a step away from animal books this year with a varied shortlist that includes the story of a grumpy toddler's day of tantrums, My Big Shouting Day by Rebecca Patterson; the tale of a baby that turns out not to be all that it seems, The Baby that Roared by Simon Puttock, illustrated by Nadia Shireen; a regal role reversal story in The Worst Princess by Anna Kemp; and a hapless dog struggling to be good in Oh No, George! by Chris Haughton. Also on the shortlist are a multiple award-winner Oliver Jeffers with Stuck, about a boy who gets his kite caught in a tree, and the chaos that ensues when he tries to retrieve it; and Jonny Duddle, an Aardman Animations artist who has already won the Waterstones children's book prize, with The Pirates Next Door. The prize was set up four years ago by the author Michael Rosen as part of his children's laureateship and seeks to celebrate the side-splittingly funny books that often get overlooked by other book prizes. \"It is splendiferous to see that children's books are still celebrating the art of a right old malarkey,\" he said, and described this year's shortlist as \"clever, odd, intriguing and above all funny stuff to read. In a word: delicious.\" He was joined on the judging panel by the broadcaster and comedian Mel Giedroyc; the author and Guardian columnist Lucy Mangan; author, illustrator and winner of the 2011 seven-14 category Liz Pichon; and illustrator and author Ed Vere. Giedroyc said: \"To laugh with a book is a very special kind of laugh indeed \u2026 it's an intimate kind of laugh which says 'this is my very own private laugh and it's mine, all mine!' People envy you this laugh, they are deeply curious about it, and they wish the laugh belonged to them too. It's a sheer privilege to tap into some great laughs from some fantastic books.\" For the second year running, the votes of children will also be counted, along the with judging panel's votes, to find the winner, with more than 500 pupils in England selected to read, discuss, and pick their favourite from the shortlists. The books are competing for a \u00a32,500 award in each category and the winner will be announced at a ceremony in London on 6 November. The prize is administered by the charity Booktrust.
