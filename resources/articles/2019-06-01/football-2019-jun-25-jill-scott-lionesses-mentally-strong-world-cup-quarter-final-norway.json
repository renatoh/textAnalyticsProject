The veteran England midfielder is convinced that hours of work in the Lionesses\u2019 \u201cmind gym\u201d paid dividends as Phil Neville\u2019s players refused to rise to Cameroon\u2019s extraordinary provocations in Valenciennes on Sunday. \u201cWe do a lot of work away from the pitch about conserving emotion at certain times in games and how to always think logically,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIn the round-of-16 win against Cameroon we saw that work actually tested on a football pitch and the girls handled it fantastically. In those moments where you might normally react we didn\u2019t.\u201d The resultant 3-0 victory has led Neville\u2019s players to Deauville on the Normandy coast where they relaxed on the broad expanse of golden sand beach outside their hotel on Tuesday morning before the start of preparations for Thursday night\u2019s awkward-looking quarter-final against Norway in Le Havre. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some fantastic psychologists over the years,\u201d Scott said. \u201cUnder Mark Sampson [the previous manager] we almost did as much work away from the pitch as we did on it but now our new psychologist, Gemma, has come in and carried on with that work with Phil. \u201cIt\u2019s actually in those moments in games like Cameroon, that you realise, that without those meetings, we may have had a completely different scenario. Some people will say experienced players should always be able to handle things, but I\u2019ve never been involved in a game like it in 140 games for England. I\u2019d say those meetings helped us keep our cool on a hot day!\u201d Under Neville, players can choose how much time they want to spend with the psychologist but group sessions involve role-play scenarios in how to handle highly emotional teammates and opponents. \u201cWe\u2019ve got so many different types of people in the squad,\u201d Scott said. \u201cYou might all do the same job when you go to work but everyone\u2019s a different character, a different personality. The meetings are very good because they can help me look at Keira [Walsh, her central midfield partner] and, if she\u2019s having an emotional moment, work out logically how to help her through. \u201cI think a lot of credit for us coming through against Cameroon should go to the staff who work on our psychological side. From now on the games are going to get even more emotional, they\u2019re going to get even tougher, but we now know we\u2019ve got a tool in our armoury to help us cope in all situations.\u201d The Manchester City midfielder regards Norway as a cross between two recent opponents. \u201cCameroon have physicality and Scotland technical ability,\u201d says Scott. \u201cAnd, if you combine them, then you get a Norway. So it\u2019s going to be difficult.\u201d After a month together as a squad, and three weeks travelling around France, England are finding things relatively straightforward off the pitch, showing few signs of tournament fatigue. Most players will, almost inevitably, have sporadic wobbles on the road but Scott believes the Lionesses are managing the downs well. \u201cYou do go through deep dips,\u201d she acknowledged. \u201cYou miss home at times; it\u2019s a long time away. But our mood\u2019s really good. \u201cTypically you have different groups in the squad that you usually hang around in, which I think is normal in any environment, but, this time, everybody\u2019s spending a lot of time together as a big group. \u201cIt\u2019s important people don\u2019t just look at what we do on the pitch, we have to manage our time away from it, too. It\u2019s a mental battle a lot of the time \u2013 it\u2019s how best to use your day off so you train to your full potential afterwards. There\u2019s a lot of very good friendships in the group but sometimes you just need a day away before coming back.\u201d At the last World Cup in Canada in 2015 the then England left-back Claire Rafferty took a borrowed dog for walks during downtime. \u201cClaire was missing a dog from home and Mark [Sampson] managed to get one from somewhere,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt was all about getting that hit of home comforts \u2013 and she did bring the dog back!\u201d One of the hardest things for players at tournaments is managing the disappointment of being omitted. \u201cEveryone wants to play in every game,\u201d said Scott, who at 32 is in the midst of her fourth World Cup. \u201cIn past years when I haven\u2019t been selected for games I remember getting really upset. \u201cSometimes you get into a group of people who aren\u2019t playing and you all become a bit negative about things; that\u2019s only natural. But the girls here that haven\u2019t been playing, like Lucy Staniforth, have been absolutely incredible. I can\u2019t fault anyone\u2019s attitude.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
