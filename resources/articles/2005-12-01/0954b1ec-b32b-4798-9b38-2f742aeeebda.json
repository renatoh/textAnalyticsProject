Both clubs are thought to be preparing bids of about \u00a31.5m for Bent, who has scored only twice in the past 12 months and has started only one game since mid-October. Yet Moyes will block his sale, particularly with Duncan Ferguson considering retirement, as he steps up his own search for striking reinforcements. \"With the numbers we have in our squad I won't be doing business on Marcus, and certainly not at that price,\" said the Everton manager, whose plans to strengthen his squad have been hampered by inflated prices. \"I think it will be a tight transfer window for us in terms of what we can bring in. We know what we'd like but, given the money involved, we most likely won't be able to do what we want.\" Sir Alex Ferguson has confirmed that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could make his long-awaited return to Manchester United's first team during the holiday programme. The Norway striker, whose last appearance was as a substitute in the 2004 FA Cup final, has fought a two-year battle against a knee injury that his manager feared could end his career. But he has come through two reserve team outings and is once again in Ferguson's plans. \"He could get on the bench,\" Ferguson said. \"With four games in eight days, I would think all the squad players will be involved at some point. He has been training every day since he came back and hopefully will get more football soon.\" Ferguson was less optimistic about Gabriel Heinze's prospects of a quicker than expected recovery from injury despite claims by Jose Pekerman, the Argentina coach, that the left-back could yet feature in his World Cup squad. \"I know how much he wants to play in the World Cup,\" Ferguson said. \"But I can't see him playing before next season.\" Spartak Moscow's defender Nemanja Vidic has revealed in an interview that he would relish a transfer to Manchester United. The 24-year-old Serbia &amp; Montenegro international, valued at \u00bf15m (\u00a310m) by his club, has been linked with moves to United and Liverpool this week but identified Old Trafford as his preferred destination. \"That's my first choice,\" he said. The Spartak director Sergei Shavlo confirmed Vidic will be allowed to leave and that the club are negotiating a deal with United."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
