The dark-haired one was wearing what appeared to be military fatigues; his much older companion seemed confused and barely able to walk. A concerned passerby went to help. The younger man, who seemed to have an American or Canadian accent, explained that he had found the older man face down on a country road and was taking him to Hereford county hospital. She walked with them, doing her best to support the faltering older man, who could not move more than a couple of paces unaided. As the three of them approached the turning to the hospital, she flagged down an ambulance. The paramedics suspected dementia and assessed the older man in the rear cabin; he seemed to be smiling and crying at the same time. He had no ID and could only give his first name, Roger. His companion, sitting opposite, told the crew the same story: he had found the man on the side of a road some distance from Credenhill, a village on the outskirts of Hereford. But he claimed he couldn\u2019t share his own contact details because he had been working at the nearby SAS base, and soon vanished into the early evening gloom. Little was as it seemed that Saturday. It was just the beginning of an extraordinary international mystery that for six months flummoxed the British authorities and generated headlines around the world. The truth only partially emerged earlier this year, when Simon Hayes, a 53-year-old personal trainer, was given a two-and-a-half-year sentence for his role in a plot to abandon Roger Curry, an autistic American man with dementia, far from his home in Whittier, California. Hayes had driven Roger to Hereford the day after he had arrived, with the rest of the Curry family, on a flight from the US. The 78-year-old had been stripped of anything that could identity him, and dressed in brand new British supermarket clothes. Yet Hayes\u2019s motivations \u2013 and indeed much of the Curry family\u2019s backstory \u2013 remain a mystery. The judge at his trial, Daniel Pearce-Higgins, struggled to find any precedents for the case. Sentencing at Worcester crown court in April this year, he remarked: \u201cI cannot find any case remotely similar to the facts of this case, curiously because there appears to be no apparent benefit to the defendant.\u201d There is no evidence that money changed hands, or that Hayes benefited in any way. Why did he go to the lengths he did to help Roger\u2019s son, Kevin Curry, dump his father more than 5,000 miles from his US home? Is he \u2013 as the court heard \u2013 a convincing liar who stage-managed the British end of a plot to get the NHS to look after an unwanted relative? Or is he \u2013 as the court also heard \u2013 a tragic figure who took refuge in a fantasy world to protect himself from a turbulent life punctuated by loss? *** It\u2019s July 2019 and Prisoner A1682EJ appears jittery as he is finally let into the cavernous visiting hall of HMP Oakwood in Staffordshire. Wearing a grey polo shirt and tracksuit bottoms, Simon Hayes shuffles one way, then the other. The G4S guards took no notice and for a few moments he waits awkwardly in the no man\u2019s land between the door and the seating area, perhaps because mine is his first visit after 10 weeks in jail. Once he is seated, I notice a red gash on his forehead and a graze on his cheek. He winces as he touches the split skin. \u201cI was slapped by my cellmate,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cI fell and I caught my head on the bed.\u201d Hayes\u2019s face is covered with a film of sweat, his eyes darting from side to side and his hands faintly shaking. He asks for a cold drink and some food to settle his nerves. \u201cThank you,\u201d he calls as I go to the kiosk. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back when I get out, mate.\u201d As he swigs from a Coke bottle and tucks into a ham sandwich, he says he is ready to talk. \u201cI\u2019m OK \u2013 when you\u2019ve been in the Marines, this is nothing,\u201d he says. Hayes says he got to know the Curry family after moving to the US to launch an offshoot of his motorsport coaching business in 2003. He was keen to make a fresh start following the loss of his adoptive mother, Anita, who died from cancer in 2001. \u201cWhen she was being treated, it was difficult,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI viewed Ken [his adoptive father] and Anita as my real parents and loved them very much \u2013 still do.\u201d He had also just recovered from a serious car accident, in which his hire car collided with a lorry near Silverstone racing circuit, where he had been training drivers. \u201cIt was a good opportunity,\u201d he says. \u201cI was also trying to figure out what my mum\u2019s death meant to me. I felt I needed to get away.\u201d Hayes settled in Los Angeles and his business started to grow, with amateur and professional drivers based in the US seeking his help. He was introduced to Kevin Curry by a mutual acquaintance; the two men shared a fascination with Area 51, the US air force base in Nevada that has long been a focus of conspiracy theories about alien spacecraft and extraterrestrials. \u201cI have an interest in the unexplained,\u201d Hayes tells me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I believe that aliens exist.\u201d He claims Kevin\u2019s interest in Area 51 stemmed from his father\u2019s connection to the base. \u201cRoger served at Area 51 as an air force technician. His family were trying to get an explanation as to why his particular dementia deteriorated so abruptly,\u201d he says, implying a connection. Despite the age difference \u2013 Hayes was 44, Kevin 29 \u2013 the pair grew close. Hayes spent Christmas 2010 with Kevin, Roger, then 70, and his wife, Mary Jo, then 59, at their house in a middle-class suburb of LA. However, Hayes soon found that all was not well with the Curry family. Mary Jo had Parkinson\u2019s disease and was finding it increasingly hard to look after her husband who, according to Hayes, was already suffering from dementia. Kevin told him the family couldn\u2019t afford to put his father in a care home. \u201cI was being asked to help out with Roger \u2013 I could see that he was becoming harder to manage,\u201d Hayes recalls. He remembers that Mary Jo would struggle to lift Roger from his chair and that sometimes he would lash out. \u201cI know that, through no fault of his own, Roger was at times uncontrollably violent towards Mary Jo,\u201d he says. Hayes also had his own problems. He says his \u201ctumultuous\u201d marriage to an American woman \u2013 whom he had met and married soon after arriving in the country \u2013 broke down in 2011. Then, in 2013, he was arrested for drink-driving. Hayes claims he had a fight with another prisoner in a holding cell, which led to his deportation. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give him my sunglasses. We got into an altercation, and then they filed charges that I incited a riot. They revoked my visa and gave me a date to turn up at the airport,\u201d he says. His account doesn\u2019t fully tally with official records. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement says Hayes was deported for overstaying his visa after his arrest for \u201cdriving under the influence\u201d by California Highway Patrol in 2013. Hayes had entered the US in 2007 under the department\u2019s visa-waiver programme, which typically allows British citizens to come to the US on holiday or business for up to 90 days. Back in the UK, Hayes moved to Somerset to live with his father, Ken, in a mobile home park; Ken was 90 and in poor health. America, though, was still on Hayes\u2019s mind; he unsuccessfully applied for visas and stayed in regular contact with Kevin. \u201cHe was a friend who was going through a very stressful period,\u201d Hayes explains. \u201cI tried my best to be supportive.\u201d He says Kevin asked him to look into ways of bringing Roger to the UK, and admits that he researched possible British care homes, but insists he had no idea that Kevin was planning to dump his father here. \u201cRoger was getting worse. He was contemplating healthcare facilities in Mexico, Canada and the UK,\u201d he says. In 2015, Kevin announced he would be coming to Europe on holiday with his children, while Roger and Mary Jo stayed in a respite home. He said he would be stopping off in the UK and invited his old friend to join him. \u201cI never take any time off, so I was excited to have a break,\u201d Hayes says. But when he went to meet Kevin at Gatwick airport, he claims he was shocked to see Roger and Mary Jo coming through the arrivals gate, too. \u201cRoger was in a wheelchair. He couldn\u2019t walk. Mary Jo looked exhausted. She could barely stand up. They had deteriorated since I had last seen them,\u201d he says. \u201cKevin told me that the hospital would not take them.\u201d That night they booked into the nearby Gatwick Marriott hotel. Hayes says Kevin asked him to take Roger to hospital, so they coud have their family holiday. Hayes says he felt sorry for Kevin and agreed. \u201cI said, \u2018Give yourselves a week and then pick your dad up, or make an arrangement with the authorities so that your dad can stay here and be financially supported by his insurance company,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I did not for one minute suggest or insinuate, in any way, shape or form, that he should be abandoned in this country.\u201d Kevin booked a hire car, naming Hayes as an additional driver. In the morning, Hayes drove 157 miles to Hereford bus station, with Roger dressed in new clothes and stripped of his ID. This part of Hayes\u2019s account is particularly puzzling: if Roger was sick, why not choose a closer hospital? There were two \u2013 East Surrey and Crawley \u2013 within about six miles. Bizarrely, Hayes claims he chose Hereford hospital because he had visited it once before with a client and thought it \u201cwas more straightforward than driving all over London\u201d. He acknowledges that his decision \u201cseems odd\u201d, adding only that he was \u201csuffering from mental health issues\u201d that clouded his judgment. Did he know Roger had been stripped of anything that could identify him, and dressed in new clothes that would provide investigators with few clues? Hayes says not, but remembers that Kevin had borrowed his credit card to do some shopping before they left for Hereford. \u201cI had told Kevin: \u2018I\u2019m not a nurse. I\u2019m not responsible for dressing or anything else to do with your dad \u2013 I\u2019m offering to drive him to a safe, lawful location where he can get medical treatment, and that\u2019s it.\u2019\u201d That afternoon, he parked in Hereford bus station and led Roger towards the hospital. Why did he tell the passerby and paramedics that he had found him face down in the countryside? \u201cI wanted to give the family some time\u2026 at least a week,\u201d he says sheepishly. How did it feel to leave a confused and distressed old man, without any medication or paperwork? Hayes hesitates, searching for the right words. \u201cIt was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve had to do,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I did it because I\u2019d seen the lack of care he got from his own country and government \u2013 a former veteran, I might add, which is disgraceful.\u201d Hayes returned to Gatwick and joined the rest of the Curry family on holiday in Copenhagen. They stayed in a city-centre hotel, but Mary Jo was in such poor health she rarely left it. Instead, Hayes says, he went for long walks with Kevin and they talked about Roger\u2019s future. \u201cIt was an odd holiday,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t relaxing. I felt uncomfortable with the situation I\u2019d been put in.\u201d Hayes left Copenhagen before the Currys. He contends that he had no idea Roger was left behind when Kevin and his mother later returned to the US. He says that when he spoke to Kevin in the weeks and months that followed, he was told Roger was back at home. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say he was lying to me\u2026\u201d he says, his voice trailing off, as if struggling to shake off some lingering loyalty to Kevin. \u201cHe misled me, whether it was for the right or the wrong reasons.\u201d *** So-called granny dumping \u2013 where families unable to afford or cope with their caring responsibilities offload elderly relatives on to hospitals \u2013 is not uncommon in the US. As far back as 1992, the American College of Emergency Physicians estimated that 70,000 elderly people were being abandoned each year. Dr Kevin Biese, an associate professor of emergency medicine at the University of North Carolina, says medical staff routinely encounter elderly people, with no pressing health needs, brought into emergency departments because their families cannot cope. \u201cFrequently we see the family saying their elderly relative \u2018had a fever yesterday\u2019 or \u2018chest pain\u2019, but what they\u2019re really saying is, \u2018We just can\u2019t take it\u2019,\u201d he says. Outright abandonments, where the family leave a relative unattended, are rarer, but still happen, especially in poorer areas. \u201cEvery emergency doctor has at least several patients a year where that is the case,\u201d Biese says. He blames the lack of support for caregivers in the US. \u201cThere is a tremendous burden placed on adult children,\u201d he says. Medicaid-funded facilities are available only to the very poorest older people. \u201cThese places are not where any of us would want to live. You might have 30 patients to one nursing assistant.\u201d According to Age UK, a record 1.4 million older people in England are not getting the support they need at home to carry out essential everyday tasks, such as getting out of bed and going to the toilet, because of the chronic underfunding of local social care services. Tom Gentry, the charity\u2019s senior health influencing manager, says some of these people are ending up in A&amp;E departments because their carers cannot cope. \u201cThese families are at the whip end of having to care for elderly relatives. Hospital is perceived to be the only option because the local authority isn\u2019t helping.\u201d Research by the charity has revealed that almost 1,000 over-65s are needlessly admitted to hospital every month. Gentry says doctors even have medical terms for admitting patients who are not in need of hospitalisation. \u201cIf a frail older person comes in with quite unspecific needs, they get \u2018social admission\u2019 written on their notes. There\u2019s even a phrase, \u2018acopia\u2019, which is basically doctors\u2019 code for saying someone can\u2019t cope at home,\u201d he says. Gentry suspects more and more British families caring for elderly relatives are reaching breaking point: \u201cOur sense is that it is getting worse, because the population is ageing and funding is barely keeping up.\u201d *** In Hereford county hospital, the nurses looking after Roger had gleaned some useful information from their good-natured but inscrutable new patient. He recalled on one fleeting occasion that his full name was Roger Curry \u2013 something he never managed to repeat during the rest of his stay in the UK. Not long afterwards he was moved to Credenhill Court rest home on the outskirts of town, which provides specialist care for dementia patients. His care was funded by Herefordshire council. Meanwhile, West Mercia police were running out of ideas. Usually dementia patients are quickly reunited with their families, but this was different. All they had was a name, but they couldn\u2019t be sure even that was correct. They checked missing person reports, examined CCTV footage and contacted the US and Canadian authorities. A social media campaign was launched. It was not until 2016, months later, that the police decided to appeal again for information; this time, Roger\u2019s story was featured on BBC and Sky News. A woman called Rebecca Reece came forward \u2013 the passerby who had flagged down the ambulance. She herself fell under suspicion; the police thought Roger might be her husband, but this was quickly ruled out. In March, the US authorities provided Hereford police with a list of names and addresses that could be linked to Roger Curry. One of these was a Kevin Curry of Whittier, California. An officer called the number linked to the address, but the person who answered claimed no one by the name of Curry lived there. That call prompted Kevin to make contact with Hayes, who says he had an emotional conversation with Mary Jo. She warned him that if he came clean, Roger would be returned to the US, where he would end up homeless because the family could not look after him. That month, Hayes researched Roger\u2019s case online before calling the police; the judge remarked that this phone call was \u201cperhaps an example of the defendant\u2019s loose grasp upon reality\u201d, as there is no certainty that he would otherwise have been found. Hayes didn\u2019t confess, however. Instead he painted a picture of a glamorous life in which he travelled internationally and lived in Los Angeles. He said he had been with a Canadian serviceman when they\u2019d found a confused old man wandering on a dual carriageway. In subsequent calls, he told officers he had been attending a course at the local SAS base, and twice changed the location where he claimed to have found Roger. Still, nothing seems to have rung alarm bells. Indeed, Hayes went on to give officers a full statement, which led to further public appeals. It wasn\u2019t until April that his story began to unravel. The police became suspicious that Roger might in fact be Hayes\u2019s father; this led them to Ken Hayes and his new wife, who stunned officers with the news that his son knew the Curry family. They also revealed that he was not living in California, as he claimed, but had been deported to the UK three years ago. *** Darragh MacIntyre was working on a Panorama film about missing people in the UK when he chanced on Roger\u2019s case in 2016. \u201cI met him in the nursing home in Hereford,\u201d he says. \u201cThe poor guy was trying his best but it wasn\u2019t really an interview.\u201d He was struck by how staff in Credenhill Court doted on Roger. \u201cHe was loved in the care home,\u201d MacIntyre recalls. \u201cSome people\u2019s character can change with dementia, but Roger was lovely. The only thing that drove staff to distraction was his love of muffins. He could eat four or five in one sitting.\u201d Roger wasn\u2019t included in the missing persons film but MacIntyre and his colleagues were intrigued by the mystery. They followed up a post on a BBC Midlands Facebook page by a viewer who had found a picture of a man named Earl Roger Curry from a 1950s US high school yearbook. MacIntyre\u2019s colleagues were able to trace this man to LA. They then used Google Earth to look at his last known address in Whittier: \u201cWe came upon what looked to be a burnt-out shack of a house in an otherwise wealthy neighbourhood,\u201d MacIntyre says. An officer who picked up the phone at the Whittier police department told the BBC that there had been a fire at the house in 2014. He also mentioned that Roger had Alzheimer\u2019s, his wife had Parkinson\u2019s disease and his son, Kevin, had been in prison. The BBC team flew out to investigate further. The family\u2019s former neighbours confirmed that it was indeed the same Roger Curry. That was not all: the neighbours mentioned that, several months before Roger appeared in Hereford, the police had been called to the burnt-out house to rescue Roger and Mary Jo. A police report records that Roger had been seen wandering around behind a padlocked chain-link fence early in the morning. The police broke in and discovered Roger and Mary Jo had been sleeping on an inflatable mattress in the porch. There was some water and food in a cool box. Kevin denied any involvement, even though the police found a key for the padlock on his keyring. MacIntyre also established that Roger had taken out a restraining order against his son in 2000. Roger had claimed Kevin \u2013 who, it emerged, has previous convictions for assault with a deadly weapon, domestic assault and fraud, as well as burglary \u2013 had on one occasion pinned him up against a wall, and on another allegedly threatened to \u201cmess him up\u201d, claiming he \u201ccould kill him\u201d. The Panorama team didn\u2019t manage to find Kevin, but their breakthrough prompted the British authorities to make arrangements for Roger\u2019s repatriation. On 14 July 2016, a heavily sedated Roger touched down at Los Angeles International airport without any fanfare or press attention. He was later interviewed at a hospital by an official from Los Angeles County, who noted Roger had trouble talking and couldn\u2019t keep his eyes open. LA County lawyers then lodged a successful application to appoint a conservator to run his affairs. It stated: \u201cNo one in his family is prepared to accept responsibility for him. His own wife and son abused him when they took him overseas only to abandon him there.\u201d That same month, the BBC returned to LA. MacIntyre staked out the former family home for two or three days before Kevin finally showed up to collect the mail. Kevin briefly spoke to MacIntyre off camera. He denied doing anything wrong: he said his father had become ill on a holiday in England and he had asked someone to take him to hospital. \u201cIt didn\u2019t add up,\u201d MacIntyre says. \u201cWhy hadn\u2019t he tried to find his dad?\u201d He waited outside until Kevin emerged to collect his car. \u201cI asked him to do a proper interview,\u201d he says. \u201cHe refused and did one of the most extraordinary things I have ever seen: he pulled his hood over his face and got in his car. But he couldn\u2019t drive very quickly because he couldn\u2019t see where he was going. It was the strangest of getaways.\u201d Kevin has not commented publicly or responded to requests from journalists, including me, since that encounter with the BBC more than three years ago. Before leaving the US, MacIntyre visited the care home where Roger was staying. It was a disturbing experience: \u201cHe was in a very dark room, with curtains pulled. There was a fresh wound on his head. There was blood on his pillow. He looked completely different from the person I\u2019d met in Hereford,\u201d he says. \u201cHe looked uncared for.\u201d A few days later, MacIntyre returned to find Roger in a better condition. \u201cThe bedclothes had been changed. He still had the wound, but he had been shaved. That was of some comfort,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I was still left with the impression that he would have been better off if he had remained in Hereford.\u201d Does he regret having found Roger\u2019s family? No, he says: \u201cI think people have to be held to account for what they do. I don\u2019t think it is permissible on any level to abandon your loved ones like they did. It is morally wrong.\u201d *** The BBC\u2019s efforts led to Hayes\u2019s arrest. Officers interviewed him in his father\u2019s home in Somerset, in April 2016. He came clean about his friendship with Kevin and admitted taking Roger to Hereford. The CPS barrister, Simon Davis, who went on to prosecute Hayes, has more than 20 years\u2019 experience of serious and complex crimes, from murder to money laundering. Yet he found this case unique, not least because Hayes had little to gain from his deceptions. \u201cIt was a very odd case, but then he was a very odd defendant,\u201d he says, on the phone from his home in Birmingham. \u201cEverything he had said at the scene in November 2015 was rubbish. Everything he said to the woman he met near the hospital and the paramedics was rubbish. Everything he said when he made contact with the police in 2016 was rubbish. His lengthy witness statement, which ran to many pages, was also full of rubbish,\u201d Davis says. The barrister told the court in April this year that Hayes was a \u201cpathological liar\u201d who led police on \u201ca wild goose chase\u201d, wasting huge amounts of police time and public funds, and costing the NHS an estimated \u00a320,000 to look after Roger. His lies, Davis argued, led to innocent people falling under suspicion, such as the passerby, Rebecca Reece. They also jeopardised Roger\u2019s care: while he was in the UK, he had no access to his dementia medicine and medical records. It wasn\u2019t just the lies Hayes was alleged to have told in Hereford: Davis suggested in court that his backstory was \u201cfull of fantasy and fiction\u201d, and that \u201cfalsifying his past, falsifying his connections and his credentials were all part and parcel of his everyday life\u201d. Hayes understandably balks at this characterisation. \u201cWhat the prosecution said is absolute bunkum,\u201d he tells me in Oakwood prison. \u201cNobody makes up a 25-plus-year career, especially the career I\u2019m in where everybody knows each other,\u201d he says. Some of the drivers he has trained seem to partly back this up. Blair Chang, an LA estate agent who used to race in a pro-amateur series, confirms he was trained by Hayes for a couple of years. \u201cHe\u2019s the best trainer of motor sports drivers that I have ever come across,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was very well respected in the industry.\u201d Chang, who became friends with Hayes, disputes the way he was depicted in court: \u201cI didn\u2019t see a bad bone in his body, to be quite honest.\u201d US motor sports journalist David Malsher recalls that Hayes was a familiar face at Champ Car and IndyCar races for about six years. \u201cHe was attached to a couple of drivers, but he was generally ultra-quiet and came across as very intense and a bit of a loner. A couple of times I was asked by people, \u2018Who\u2019s that weird little dude with X or Y driver?\u2019\u201d But the Royal Navy has no record of Hayes serving with the Marines, and the McLaren Formula One racing team has no record of him working as human performance director, as he claimed in a local newspaper in 2015. Hayes, who has no previous convictions in this country, is by all accounts a complicated character. Yet a psychologist who examined him before he was sentenced found that behind \u201chis grandiose expressions about his capabilities, his business acumen\u201d lay a vulnerable man with \u201ca tragic background of loss\u201d. He now readily admits to misleading the police \u2013 although he stresses he was motivated by a desire to help. \u201cThe only serious lies I\u2019ve told were in protection of Roger and his family,\u201d he says. Does he feel that Kevin took advantage of him? \u201cI would say probably, to a degree, but I understand why he did it,\u201d he says. Meanwhile, Hayes\u2019s adoptive family have stuck by him. His father, Ken, remembers a good-natured boy who did well at school. \u201cHe didn\u2019t put a foot wrong until he went to America. He was everything I wanted from a son,\u201d he says on the phone from Somerset. He feels his son was led astray. \u201cI met Kevin once when I went on holiday to see Simon,\u201d he says. \u201cI think Simon has been treated unfairly by him.\u201d The court heard that Kevin played a much bigger role in the plot, and stood to gain more if it succeeded. He was the one who, in advance of their trip to Europe, purchased return tickets for everyone in the family, apart from his father. He took Roger and Mary Jo on the plane, and booked the hire car that would take his father to Hereford. During Hayes\u2019s trial, the prosecution stated that Kevin was under investigation for abuse, fraud and kidnap in the US. This was repeated by West Mercia police in the days after Hayes was convicted. Yet the Los Angeles county district attorney\u2019s office insists no criminal charges have been filed. Neither the LAPD nor the LA sheriff\u2019s department is investigating Kevin Curry. Since Roger was repatriated, Kevin and Mary Jo have managed to keep a low profile. Mary Jo, who is thought to be living with her son in Norwalk, California, appeared with a lawyer at a 2016 hearing to determine Roger\u2019s fate; she never filed a counterpetition to that of LA county to appoint a probate conservator. Only one member of the wider family has broken ranks. Tim Otters, Kevin\u2019s uncle, told a Daily Mail reporter this year that Kevin had misled him about Roger\u2019s whereabouts when he last saw him. \u201cKevin\u2019s been a total liar ever since he was a little kid,\u201d Otters is reported to have said. MacIntyre tells me it seems wrong that Hayes is the only person who ended up in prison. \u201cSimon\u2019s motivation may well have been to help his friend, Kevin. There is certainly an irony that he is the one who has been punished,\u201d he says. Meanwhile, Roger has been through a succession of care homes and is now in the Long Beach area of LA. His court-appointed conservator, Lorraine Tafoya, visited him last year. In a report filed with the court, she says she found him upbeat but noted that he had not had any visits from family or friends. He was in need of shoes, clothing and underwear. In her latest report, submitted in May this year, she found that Roger\u2019s health had worsened, leading to him being hospitalised twice. He is no longer able to walk and needs help eating, grooming and bathing. Now 79, Roger did not speak to Tafoya but his carers told her \u2013 in a familiar refrain, from Hereford to LA \u2013 that he remained \u201cmild-mannered and respectful\u201d. The LA county department of mental health says neither Roger\u2019s wife nor son \u2013 who is allowed to see him, providing he does not take him out of the care home \u2013 has been to visit him since he was flown back to the US in 2016. *** At Oakwood prison, the G4S guards announce our visiting session is nearing its end. Girlfriends kiss boyfriends. Middle-aged men squeeze their sons\u2019 shoulders. Brothers embrace. Hayes gets up from behind the empty cups, bottles and packets covering the table. His blood-stained head drops and he troops back towards the holding cell. In these final moments, his mask again appears to slip and the vulnerability noted by his psychologist is plain to see. It is hard not to be reminded of the judge\u2019s observation that Hayes\u2019s actions, while certainly costly, \u201cmay have been a misguided attempt to help another\u201d. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication)."}, "isHosted": false}}}
