He is being described as the new Philip Roth, the new Chekhov. A Latvian Jew, he arrived in Toronto at the age of seven. Now 31, he has published a slim book of stories that are presumably autobiographical: Bezmozgis becomes Berman, a character who shares the basic details of his author's life. He starts as a child on the streets of a bewildering city. Left with a dog, he lets it get run over. \"The pimply young man stammered a few sentences of which I understood nothing except the word 'sorry'.\" Through seven stories, Berman negotiates his new home while beginning to understand the burdens of adulthood and his heritage: \"who wins if a Jew doesn't go to synagogue? I'll tell you who: Hitler.\" In the title story, two more immigrants arrive: his uncle's new wife and her 14-year-old daughter. Berman is older, but laughably less experienced, never yet having seen a naked female body. His young cousin shows him that, and much more, telling him: \"Russia is shit but people enjoy themselves.\" In 25 pages, Bezmozgis describes the experiences of immigrants, a boy's sexual awakening, a young man's decision to become an adult, and the clash between Russia and America. The one great problem is that, having chosen to base his fiction on his own experiences, Bezmozgis is travelling along a well-worn groove. We have been here so many times, peering into the clever, conflicted, ambitious thoughts of a young Jewish writer, obsessed with sex and books, approaching adulthood in a north American suburb. Despite his brilliance, Bezmozgis suffers by the inevitable comparisons: he is too polite, too restrained, never sufficiently surprising. There is a whiff of the creative writing course - a hint that these neat tales have been crafted to please a teacher rather than to delight a reader. But Bezmozgis's prose is unusually assured, and suggests the hype may not be entirely exaggerated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
