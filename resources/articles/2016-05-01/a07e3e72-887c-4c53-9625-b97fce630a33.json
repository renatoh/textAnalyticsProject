The interview on Wednesday was the first time Turnbull has appeared on Jones\u2019 program since a bruising encounter in June 2014 in which Turnbull refused to \u201ctake dictation\u201d from Jones, who had asked him to back the 2014 budget. Turnbull praised Jones\u2019 eloquence in earlier statements pointing out the generosity of superannuation tax concessions and highlighted the need to \u201clive within our means\u201d. It followed appeals from senior Liberals for Turnbull to make peace with Jones. Jones asked Turnbull about elements of the Safe Schools program, and whether it was appropriate for 15-year-olds to role play characters including a lesbian or a bisexual girl who rarely practises safe sex. Turnbull said he was not familiar with that element of the program but the government had made changes to the Labor program to require parental involvement and consent. He said the program was \u201cno substitute for very active, engaged and involved parents ... We believe parents should be right into it.\u201d Jones suggested the Coalition and Labor both appeared to support the role play elements, which should be \u201cwiped out of the curriculum\u201d. Jones also peppered Turnbull with questions about the $25,000 annual limit on concessional contributions to superannuation introduced by the 2016 budget. Jones warned the measure would make it more difficulty for a hypothetical 40-year-old to build up their super balance to $1m before retirement. Turnbull explained a person earning $100,000 a year would have about $9,000 automatically put into super, allowing them to contribute an extra $16,000 a year taxed at the concessional rate of 15%. \u201cThis is one of the things we\u2019ve done to make super fairer and more flexible,\u201d he said. Turnbull defended taxing income from super balances over $1.6m as the \u201cmost administratively straightforward\u201d way to trim the generosity of super tax concessions. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about less than 1% of the population, the vast majority of the population don\u2019t have anything like this [amount],\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe our changes to superannuation are fair and well targeted. The reality is we have to live within our means. The super concessions are very generous, they remain very generous. What we\u2019ve done is dialled them back a bit for people on very high incomes and with very high super balances, people like you and me for example.\u201d Jones quipped, \u201cI\u2019m not in your league [prime minister]\u201d, to which Turnbull chuckled and replied, \u201cWell, who knows?\u201d \u201cYes there are people who are unhappy about it,\u201d Turnbull said. He said a person with a super balance of $4m would be pay no tax on earnings from the balance up to $1.6m, and just 15% on the balance, which he noted was lower than the lowest rate of personal income tax. Turnbull defended the requirement for superannuants to draw down their balances by explaining the idea of super was to achieve financial independence in retirement not to amass wealth. \u201cThe idea of super is not to be a wealth creation exercise, to build up a large capital amount,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea is you get big tax incentives to put money into super ... the idea is that people live off that and consume both the income and a portion of the capital.\u201d Turnbull said the draw-down rates, which Jones described as \u201csteep\u201d, would be reviewed every five years. The interview also included Turnbull\u2019s explanation of the government\u2019s agenda for \u201cjobs and growth\u201d and the planned trajectory to surplus in 2020. Turnbull blamed housing unaffordability on constraints on supply, which he said were caused by state and local governments. He said the federal government would not be a \u201cpassive ATM that hands out money willy-nilly\u201d but would encourage increased supply of housing with its cities policy linking land release to funding. Turnbull criticised Labor\u2019s negative gearing policy by claiming \u201crich people\u201d who earn income from rent and shares would still be able to lower their tax on that income with negatively geared property. By contrast people who earned income from \u201cpersonal exertion\u201d and \u201cthe sweat of their brow\u201d would not be able to reduce their tax with negative gearing, he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
