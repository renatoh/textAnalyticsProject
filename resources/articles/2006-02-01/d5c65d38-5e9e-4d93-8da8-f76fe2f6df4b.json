No, wait! According to Dell spokesman Liem Nguyan, it was because Dell \"saw an opportunity to streamline and consolidate our portfolio\". That would be to streamline it from one with a non-selling MP3 player to one without a non-selling player, presumably. The decision to stop selling the player may be the final indication that the economies and tactics of the PC market - where different companies make the computer, the operating system and the software - really don't work in the consumer electronics space. At the launch of the Dell DJ, some observers said that this was the death knell for the iPod, because Dell would use its size and marketing muscle to squash the upstart, as it already sold so many more computers than Apple. Dell's retreat makes an interesting contrast with the optimism displayed at the launch in October 2003 by Donnie Oliphant, the DJ's senior product marketing manager, who said: \"As we see it, the Digital Jukebox is a natural fit for our new focus on consumer electronics. With the usability and functionality of this device, it's a perfect complement to our pre-existing product lines.\" Well, Dell's not selling any of its computers from 2003, either. In fact, the withdrawal provides an insight into the headlock the iPod now has on the digital music player market, particularly in the US. According to researchers NPD Group, iPods made up 69% of all music players sold from January through November in the US, while Creative Technology, Sandisk and Samsung each sold less than 10%. That leaves just a few per cent of the market for Dell and everyone else, and given that the US market was probably about 40m players (or less), that would leave Dell scrapping for sales of 400,000 machines with every other MP3 maker - including itself, as it also sells a Flash memory-based player, the Dell Ditty. The Ditty will survive, for now. Nguyen said: \"We made a decision to transition from the hard-drive products to Flash players at the beginning of this year.\" No word yet on whether the Dell online music store, launched at the same time as the Dell DJ, will survive, or for how long. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
