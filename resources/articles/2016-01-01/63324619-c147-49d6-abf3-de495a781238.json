Militia leader Ammon Bundy and his rightwing followers, who have been stationed at the headquarters of the Malheur national wildlife refuge since 2 January, have used Facebook, YouTube and live-stream videos to get their message out directly to the public and to call on anti-government activists to support their cause. In the process, they\u2019ve attracted significant media coverage from across the globe while also holding daily press briefings at the entrance to the refuge that draw huge crowds of hungry reporters each morning. But their public relations strategy has repeatedly suffered from bizarre self-aggrandizing videos that rogue militiamen continue to post to their followers. The steady feed of rambling selfie videos have prompted widespread mockery and scorn and in some cases have clearly further distracted from the plight of Harney County ranchers whom the militia claim to be backing. Most recently, militiaman Jon Ritzheimer, the prominent anti-Islam activist from Arizona, posted a Facebook video of himself opening hate mail sent to the refuge, including a box filled with dildos. \u201cIt\u2019s really ridiculous. This one was really funny \u2013 a bag of dicks,\u201d he said in the video before angrily shoving a bunch of packages off the table. \u201cThey just spend all their money on hate, hate, hate, hate!\u201d he shouted. The episode made the rounds on social media this week and became the subject of many gifs. And on Tuesday, Oregon Public Broadcasting uncovered a video from an occupier named David Fry from Ohio, who filmed himself using government computers at the compound to create an \u201cOregon standoff\u201d website. The videos are the latest in a series of social media messages from numerous members of the Bundy bunch \u2013 footage that often captures long-winded and sometimes incoherent speeches that, at the very least, draw further support within rightwing online communities. They may have learned some lessons about how to garner consistent national news coverage from the standoff with the federal government in 2014, which was led by Ammon\u2019s father, Cliven Bundy, a Nevada rancher. But marketing and communications experts in Oregon who have closely followed the standoff, which has caused a major backlash in the nearby town of Burns, said the militia\u2019s PR tactics were disjointed and chaotic and were only breeding further resentment from the people they purport to be helping. \u201cIf they are trying to get America to pay attention to the grievances they have with federal laws, they are losing that battle,\u201d said Mike Phillips, a public relations specialist with Portland firm AM:PM. \u201cThey do not have an effective spokesperson. Having so many people involved and so many people creating their own messaging on their own platforms \u2026 they\u2019ve just created a big mess.\u201d Phillips pointed to Ritzheimer\u2019s video as a clear example of how the militiamen were doing a poor job of drawing attention to complaints about the overreach of the federal government. \u201cHe should not be a spokesperson,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cHe\u2019s created a huge distraction \u2026 and opened up an avenue for the media to pay attention to that. He\u2019s also opened the door to receive more bags of dicks. It\u2019s just kind of a cluster of craziness.\u201d At the very least, the use of social media has ramped up support within various conservative militia organizations and so-called \u201cpatriot\u201d groups, which may be why more activists continue to flock to the occupation from across the country. \u201cThere\u2019s a significant amount of people in this movement using technologies to communicate with one another. It\u2019s effective for that very small proportion of people,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good technique to reach out to their core audience.\u201d The militia\u2019s latest PR move was to announce a meeting in town on Friday, which will be the first time the militiamen leave the compound and formally meet with Burns residents. Given the huge pushback against the occupation from Harney County officials, the meeting is likely to further escalate tensions and draw more media attention to the questionable tactics of the militia. \u201cIf they were going to do this over again, they probably would\u2019ve been better served by building more of a coalition on the ground,\u201d said Ward Hubbell, another public relations specialist based in Portland. \u201cThey didn\u2019t really get permission from any stakeholders there to represent their interests.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
