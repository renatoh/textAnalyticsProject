Following his 5-4 win over Ding Junhui from the unpromising position of 2-4, 0-69, Maguire almost managed another remarkable recovery from 4-2 adrift. At 4-3 Swail led by 23 with only 18 on the table but unluckily ran in-off in escaping from a snooker. Maguire cleared the last three colours to tie and added the tie-break black with a corner pocket double. Swail, who had pulled a muscle in his cue arm in the sixth frame, making him wary of certain shots, took four scoring visits to lead 43-0 in the decider. There was nothing in it, though, by the time Maguire, escaping from a fluked snooker on the brown, instead clipped the blue in to allow the Northern Irishman to pot brown, blue and pink to reach the 10th ranking semi-final of a 17-year career which has yet to provide him with a title. \"It was very exciting for the spectators,\" Swail acknowledged. \"But it was a different sort of excitement to the likes of O'Sullivan, because I was twitchy. I'm not used to this after all these years and, with the bad luck I had, I just couldn't seem to get over the line.\" Maguire confessed to feeling surprisingly \"flat\" for a quarter-final, perhaps a consequence of the 10am start. \"To be 3-1 down with the sort of chances I had was disgraceful.\" Allister Carter, whose long potting these days is the most consistent on the circuit, reached his fourth semi-final of the season from six attempts by beating Shaun Murphy, winner of December's UK Championship, 5-2. Consecutive frame-winning breaks of 74, 73 and 62 to lead 3-1 were the core of a performance which suggests that he is in the form which may secure him his first title this week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
