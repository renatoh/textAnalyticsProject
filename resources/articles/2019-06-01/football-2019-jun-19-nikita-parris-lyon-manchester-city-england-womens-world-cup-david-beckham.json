It is the club prize the England forward wants above all others for one simple reason: \u201cJust because I\u2019m a Liverpool supporter. That 2005 final was very motivational for me,\u201d says Parris of Liverpool men\u2019s dramatic second-half revival after falling 3-0 behind against Milan. Then 11, she recalls the emotion: \u201cI remember going from absolute hysterical tears to absolute joy. I\u2019ve never ever felt emotion like it. Not even when [the men] recently beat Barcelona \u2013 because Anfield is a special place I always knew that there was a possibility, whereas in the Champions League final there was nothing left. I knew we couldn\u2019t give any more and then it just became a dream. \u201cThere\u2019s not many moments like that in football as a fan but also as a player. As a fan I sat there and thought: \u2018I want to do that as a player. I want to lift that trophy.\u2019\u201d Parris has become the third player to swap Manchester for Lyon in three years, following in the footsteps of Lucy Bronze and Izzy Christiansen. After four and a half years at City and a season that \u201cebbed and flowed\u201d, with a domestic cup double the highlight and an early Champions League exit and falling short in the league the lows, the timing felt right. The decision to join arguably the best team in the world was a \u201cno-brainer\u201d, despite offers from across Europe. \u201cThey are irresistible because they\u2019re the best,\u201d says Parris matter-of-factly. \u201cEveryone wants to win the Champions League and they consistently win. They\u2019ve won it four times in a row, and six times in total. That\u2019s massive. \u201cI just want to be at the best place possible to ensure that I really kick on in my career, that I constantly have challenges, because in football you don\u2019t have long. It\u2019s easy to become complacent when game time comes so easily and you\u2019re doing so well.\u201d The 25-year-old says it was hard to leave the club that nurtured her from a prospect into the WSL\u2019s all-time record goalscorer but the chance to take her journey from Toxteth to the top, and to prove she is good enough for it, was key. \u201cEveryone used to say I\u2019m a rising star and I\u2019ve got raw talent, but I really wanted to be honestly the best. \u201cYou always second-guess yourself when times become hard but ultimately I\u2019ve stuck with it. My mum, my dad, my brothers and sisters have been a real support system to kick me on. \u201cI have a niece now and it makes me want to be better for her. Just to show that there\u2019s a big wide world outside Toxteth and you can imprint yourself in any one of those places as long as you do the hard work and have the desire.\u201d Making a difference matters and the forward does a huge amount off the pitch to build on the foundations for women\u2019s football laid by those who trod the turf before her. But she admits being a role model is \u201ca bit surreal\u201d. \u201cWhen I see girls running around saying: \u2018I want to be the next Nikita Parris,\u2019 I always say: \u2018Don\u2019t be me, be better than me.\u2019 Because ultimately, if they\u2019re better than me they\u2019ll take the game much further than I have in this moment. Like the pioneers of the game \u2013 the likes of Casey Stoney, Fara Williams, Alex Scott \u2013 I hope they look back and think they really pushed the game on.\u201d From the moment she started kicking a ball by the side of the pitch at her elder brothers\u2019 games, she was welcomed. Her neighbour took her to join an under-nines team and later she played for youth clubs. \u201cI was massively embraced. It wasn\u2019t a case of boys and girls, it was just a football team. And that\u2019s what I feel the attitude should be like these days. It\u2019s not about women\u2019s football, men\u2019s football, England women and England men. It\u2019s about England and football. It\u2019s not about your gender. \u201cIt\u2019s about who\u2019s good enough to play for their country, to represent their country and ultimately to win trophies. And that\u2019s how I felt growing up. I went into the youth centre and it was a sports hall full of boys and I was welcomed. They made me feel wanted and appreciated from the age of seven. So from then I always knew I had a home in football.\u201d Representing Toxteth, frustratingly synonymous with poverty and the 1981 riots, is as important as giving hope to those in the area. \u201cEveryone would see the history of Toxteth as being the riots but there\u2019s so much more,\u201d she says passionately. \u201cMany sporting stars have come from Toxteth. I hope we show young people that there are other perspectives of the area. I can show it in football. You can then change the landscape.\u201d Now Parris will be sharing the limelight with the Lyon gal\u00e1cticos. \u201cI\u2019m not intimidated because I know my own quality. I know I\u2019ll put my best foot forward to really try and deliver in each and every session to ensure that I make the most of my time in Lyon. I\u2019m not there just to collect trophies and sit on a bench. I\u2019m there to improve as a player and play.\u201d Before then, though, there is the small matter of England\u2019s final Group D match against Japan at the World Cup, then the knockouts. Parris opened her account on her World Cup debut, against Scotland: \u201cScoring a goal for England is special. Scoring in a World Cup is even more special. First World Cup \u2013 getting the first goal? I\u2019m very happy about that.\u201d Despite the standout season, she says her place in the squad never felt assured. \u201cI had sweaty palms!\u201d says Parris, laughing, when asked what it was like waiting for the 8am squad email. \u201cFrom 8am in the morning, 8.10, refresh, refresh. \u201d The Football Association\u2019s celebrity-led social media announcements came the next day and Parris had no idea what was coming. \u201cPhil [Neville] texted me after the squad came out and said: \u2018You\u2019re going to have a great surprise tomorrow.\u2019\u201d And she did \u2026 \u201cIt was David Beckham and he announced that I will wear the No 7 as well. It was unbelievable. I was running up and down the gym like a headless chicken screaming \u2018yesssss\u2019.\u201d From a young girl with a scratched and overplayed Bend It Like Beckham DVD, she has come a long way. \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.
