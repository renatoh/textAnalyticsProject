Take cuttings of pelargoniums now and you'll have lots of floriferous, healthy plants next summer. Make cuttings a couple of inches long, and remove the bottom leaves. Push several around the edges of a terracotta pot filled with well-drained soil, and water each time it dries out. Keep new cuttings and old plants in a bright, cool room, watering infrequently, until they begin growing in February, when water and food can be started. Clean up that pond To keep ponds happy and healthy, you need occasionally to thin out the plants, and now is the time for such a cull. Aim to have no more than half of the water covered by floaters (such as waterlily pads) and oxygenating weed, otherwise the water will become starved of oxygen, particularly if the weather is warm. Remove foliage to the side of the pond and leave it there for a day or two to allow anything caught up to escape back into the water."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
