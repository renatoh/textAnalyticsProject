I wouldn't consider buying another newspaper. I teach media studies to 11- to 16-year-olds in Basingstoke, and I find that although I have to buy all of the dailies when I talk to my students about newspapers, I quickly discard the others. The mix of writers who are not afraid to rattle cages, entertaining articles and excellent photography is what appeals to me. I often agree with the editorial politics, but as a life-long socialist I could not bring myself to vote Lib-Dem last year, as backed by the Guardian, and I think others might agree that I was correct in my opinion. I'm now 50 and I live in Finchampstead, near Wokingham with my wife Lyn and our three lovely cats. My likes have changed little over the years \u2013 music, books and film, cricket and football \u2013 so I enjoy Mike Selvey for his cricket writing and Pete Bradshaw's no-nonsense film reviews. When I first started reading the paper, I worshipped Nancy Banks-Smith and Matthew Engel \u2013 so much so that I once asked Engel to sign a cricket scorecard for me at a match. He was very non-plussed, and asked if I was sure I knew who he was. What to improve? As a tech-phile, I miss Thursday's technology section. And as a life-long supporter of League One Brentford, I have to say that your lower-league football coverage is pretty awful. Don't people ever get tired of reading about the overpaid primadonnas of the Premiership?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
