Hull City travel to the Emirates Stadium on Saturday with Arsenal 12 points behind the leaders Chelsea in fourth place in the Premier League. A shock 2-1 home defeat by Watford was followed by a comprehensive beating at the hands of Chelsea and focus returned once again to the Gunners\u2019 inability to sustain a title challenge. Speaking before this weekend\u2019s fixture, however, Wenger was unwilling to concede that he needed to adapt his managerial style or even that the championship is over. \u201cWhen you are a competitor you fight,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cYou fight as far as you can and we are in a double fight. We are in a fight to be in the top four, but we also have to fight because we want to catch Chelsea. We have to refuse to give up.\u201d Confronted with the suggestion that he is too rarely critical of his players, at least in public, Wenger said: \u201cI\u2019ve been in the job for 34 years at the top level. You [the media] perceive what you want but I think we have brought more players out than everybody else. Look at the careers of the players when they\u2019ve left us, I think we are one of the clubs that develop players well and gets the best out of them.\u201d Asked if he had spoken critically with his players after the Chelsea defeat, Wenger replied: \u201cI don\u2019t want to come out on that. It\u2019s difficult enough to keep some things internal.\u201d Wenger, who has secured Champions League qualification for Arsenal in each of the past 19 seasons, said his team now had a chance to prove they are mentally tough. \u201cThe way we respond to our disappointing result last Saturday is vital,\u201d the manager said. \u201cWe are here to win football games so when we don\u2019t win football games we are very disappointed. But it\u2019s also an interesting week because it\u2019s a good test at an important moment of the season and it\u2019s a good opportunity to show what we are made of. \u201cWe have a big fight in the Premier League, a big fight in the Champions League and we still have the FA Cup as well. It\u2019s hard of course [to qualify for the Champions League] but I think we have enough quality to do it.\u201d When asked if his side had shown enough mental strength against Chelsea, Wenger said: \u201cOf course they did. You do not play at that level and go out there and want to lose the game. Psychologically Chelsea used our weaknesses in the game and I think we were a bit unlucky as well because that first goal [in which Marcos Alonso knocked H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn to the ground in the act of scoring] is absolutely scandalous.\u201d Wenger also made a call for fans to unite behind the team, after scenes of dissatisfaction following the Chelsea match which prompted the TV pundit Gary Neville to call one supporter an \u201cidiot\u201d after he held up a banner calling for Wenger to go. \u201cOur fans have been consistent and have a high level of expectation, as I have as well,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel it is absolutely clear. You cannot be a fan until last Tuesday and not be behind the team this Saturday \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make sense. \u201cAll the other clubs we fight with, Man Utd, Man City and Liverpool, they have big expectations as well and big histories. You have Tottenham. Everyone is in the fight and everyone is behind their team. We are in a fight there. We absolutely have to be united or we have no chance to do it. We have to do exactly the same, even if we had two disappointing results.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
