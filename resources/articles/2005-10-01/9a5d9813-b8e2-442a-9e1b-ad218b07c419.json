For the adventurous, it means escaping to a leisure centre, a jar in a local hostelry or a jaunt along the high street. Even those who remain desk-bound can find ways to create a bit of excitement. My favourite lunchtime entertainment used to involve a jumped-up team leader and a bunch of grapes. Daily, on his midday departure, we would unscrew his mouse and replace the mouse ball with a grape. It worked like a dream. The joke, that is, not the mouse. To be fair, the joke wasn't particularly funny after about the third time. But it annoyed Mr Pretentious every time, and that made everyone else laugh. Childish? Maybe, but it seemed reasonable to engage in a few harmless diversions at his expense. Lunchtime escapades often rely on that nebulous concept of team spirit. This is really the illusion of friendliness created by simultaneous moaning about the malevolent factors in the office - HR, bad managers, cranky air conditioning, pick your favourite. Team spirit encourages colleagues to overcome these hardships by cooperating in ways that exceed the requirements of normal work relationships. Knowing that my best workmate was feeling a bit glum one day, I drove him all the way from Staines to Windsor in search of a BK Whopper. Curiously, Staines has no Burger King, whereas Windsor has one just across the road from the castle, ideally situated should the Queen ever fancy nipping out for a Chicken Royale. With our fast food feast in the bag and time running out, we had to make a quick return. Not wanting to get sticky fingers in the car, I insisted on driving back to the office to eat. It rather went against the spirit of adventure, but this was my car, not a company freebie, and I was not prepared to tolerate ketchup messing up the mock walnut interior. By the time we got back, the food was cold, of course. But at least we'd had fun along the way, cracking jokes and swapping impressions of Dave the accountant and Kevin his flunkey. This must, I thought, have cheered up my partner in mischief. At least, I thought we were having fun. Deep down, though, I suspected my sad companion had really been hoping for a better offer. For weeks he had been waiting for a chance to spend time out of the office with his dream girl from IT. A romantic rendezvous was always just about to happen. Mick wasn't quite \"on a promise\", but he could sense something exciting in the air. So when it failed to happen yet again, I stepped in with the idea of a fast food thrill. Back at his desk, with those greasy fingers, Mick picked up his voicemail. A message had been left two minutes after we had left. \"Mick, it's Heidi. I'm just wondering if you're free this lunchtime, because I'm going to have fish and chips down by the riverside. Call me back in the next five minutes if you can come.\" The look of despair on Mick's face was terrible. My well-meant companionship had taken away his one chance of a dream date. Sadly, Heidi left the company soon after. That better offer never came again. I learnt an important lesson that day. If a colleague looks miserable, it's usually best to leave him alone. Never badger him into having fun. It might just ruin the rest of his life. Or, at the very least, his entire lunchtime. Far better to annoy an enemy. Can someone please pass the grapes?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
