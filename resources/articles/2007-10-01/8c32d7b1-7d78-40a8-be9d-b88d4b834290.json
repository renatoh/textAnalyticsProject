(It hasn't reached Berlin yet). You can't now smoke in the public rooms of the hotels, but at the Festspeilhaus in Baden Baden, during the intervals of Tristan and Isolde, I found a smoking lounge, a more civilised attitude than in the mean and unpleasant land England is becoming. In Italy I haven't seen one no smoking sign in any church - not like the little 900-year-old church in Fridaythorpe, Yorkshire that I often go in for contemplation. Blair and Brown are cultural vandals. In Rome, most people sit outside the restaurants, merrily eating, drinking, smoking and enjoying themselves. You never know what might happen tomorrow.
