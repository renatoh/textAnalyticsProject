The likelihood of the Tottenham striker starting in Turin became greater on Saturday after Danny Welbeck pulled out of the squad because of a knee injury he suffered in Friday\u2019s 4-0 win over Lithuania. Welbeck sustained the injury in the second half of the victory at Wembley and was replaced in the 77th minute. Kane\u2019s first England goal, 78 seconds after coming on for his debut, has done nothing to dampen the fervour surrounding the 21-year-old. But Hodgson said he took seriously his responsibility to handle Kane\u2019s introduction to the senior England side sensitively for the match in Turin, where he is likely to start given injuries to Welbeck and Daniel Sturridge. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to hold him back, there\u2019s no question of that,\u201d Hodgson said of the country\u2019s joint top scorer in club football. \u201cBut I\u2019m rather hoping I\u2019ve got Harry Kane for a long period to come and I don\u2019t want to be the one who throws him in and he flies too close to the sun.\u201d Hodgson said he could understand the feverish excitement among fans around Kane following a \u201cdream come true\u201d on his debut, but that it was his responsibility to work with the Spurs coach, Mauricio Pochettino, to manage his development to avoid burn out. \u201cWhen someone has shone quite so brilliantly, that\u2019s always in the back of your mind. But from what I\u2019ve seen of him, from what I know of the apprenticeship he\u2019s already served, when I look at the qualities he possesses as a football player I\u2019ve got no fears that will happen,\u201d said Hodgson. \u201cBut I still think it\u2019s prudent of Tottenham Hotspur and Pochettino and myself as the England manager not to stand here in front of you singing his praises.\u201d Hodgson, who said he may have to reorganise the team to play Kane in a front two with Wayne Rooney, has spoken to Pochettino about how to handle a summer that could feature a trip to Australia with Spurs and a European Under-21 tournament in the Czech Republic. \u201cI totally understand where people come from. I\u2019m certain if I was just a fan I\u2019d be shouting the same things,\u201d said Hodgson. \u201cBut when you\u2019ve got a responsibility as a manager and a coach, not just to Harry Kane but to lots of other players, you have to think what\u2019s best for everybody, what\u2019s best for the team and what\u2019s going to make it work.\u201d Rooney, who has plenty of experience in handling hype, also backed Kane to deal with the frenzy around him and enjoy a long international career. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible really,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can feel the excitement around the country and you could hear when he came on everyone wanted him to come on. He probably didn\u2019t even think himself that he\u2019d score so quick. \u201cThrough speaking to him, you can see he\u2019s a level-headed guy and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s got good people around him and he\u2019ll have the ability to be able to cope with what comes.\u201d Nine players have withdrawn from the squad since it was announced. That means Hodgson has 17 outfield players to choose from for the game against the country that beat England in their World Cup opener in Manaus last June. Hodgson wants to give Kieran Gibbs his seventh cap and has called up Southampton\u2019s Ryan Bertrand as cover for the Arsenal defender."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
