Daniel (Daniel Travis) and Susan (Blanchard Ryan) are a good-looking pair of American yuppies who snatch a brief holiday from their busy lives and head off to a tourist island in the West Indies. Kentis gets them from home to this Caribbean paradise in half-a-dozen shots. They spend their first day shopping and looking around before joining other tourists on an early-morning boat trip to go scuba-diving some 40 miles offshore. Three islanders conduct the party and all seems relaxed and orderly. Their leader makes jokes about friendly sharks and what to do if you see one. 'Shut your eyes!' he says, and everyone laughs. He counts the party - there are 20 - and a brief moment of tension comes when an assertive American misplaces his mask and is told he can't go into the water. The others set off and it's a wonderland down there, of exotic fish, and Daniel and Susan, both experienced divers, follow a weaving eel. Back at the boat, there's a plausibly handled mix-up over the numbers as the members of the party emerge from the water. Twenty are recorded and the boat returns to the island, leaving Daniel and Susan behind. It's 10.30am. The movie is a cross between Home Alone and Jaws, though without the comic relief or commercial calculation of either. Boats go by in the distance, a plane flies overhead, oblivious to their plight. Then come cold and cramp. Jellyfish sting them and sharks pass beneath them in a subterranean hell that hours before had been a magical heaven. Daniel and Susan run a gamut from buoyant hope to utter despair. They bicker ('I wanted to go skiing,' Susan says) and make up, get hysterical, then calm down, hug each other for consolation, declare their love. They find out how small and vulnerable people are when isolated in a hostile world. Will they live to dine out on the experience, to laugh about it as they tell friends of their plight? The picture grabbed me in a painful, visceral way as few recent pictures have. This comes from the convincing acting, naturalistic dialogue, clever pacing and the harsh images (it was shot on digital video) that give the film the authentic feel of a home movie. It is very much a family affair, written, directed and edited by Chris Kentis, produced by his wife, Laura Lau, and photographed by the two of them. There's a good score, using both electronic music and West Indian songs. Much more expensive and a good deal less effective is the week's other American thriller, Wicker Park, a faithful transposition of Gilles Mimouni's sleek L'Appartement from Paris to a wintry Chicago. It's the story of a coup de foudre, or two such coups, and turns upon Josh Hartnett, a fast-rising executive with an attractive fiancee, who catches a glimpse of an old girlfriend he thought had deserted him and ducks out of an important business trip to China to pursue her. The complicated story involves flashbacks and repetition of scenes from different perspectives. Like the French picture, it's a Hitchcockian affair, influenced especially by Vertigo and makes an express homage to the Master through a scene of a vital key that has to be retrieved from a drain. Wicker Park lacks the style that conceals the implausibilities of L'Appartement, and Josh Hartnett is a dull replacement for the electric Vincent Cassel. But if you don't know the story, you'll be intrigued by it. Ben Stiller has appeared in five films so far this year, the third being the hilarious DodgeBall . The fourth, Envy, is much less good and doesn't fulfil the promise engendered by bringing him together with Jack Black. They play lifelong friends, living next door to each other and working in minor managerial jobs for a LA sandpaper company. Stiller is the more successful until the bumbling Black invents a substance that makes dog shit disappear. Marketing it in spray form as Vapoo Rize, he becomes a multimillionaire. Instead of moving to Beverly Hills, Black razes his little San Fernando Valley house and replaces it with a mansion of surpassing ostentation. Stiller's envy nearly ruins his life and brings him under the sinister influence of a mad hobo played by Christopher Walken. The film opens slowly and the weak plot goes up a succession of narrative cul-de-sacs. Barry Levinson continues to be off form. Slightly better is Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, in which Stiller appears along with other guest stars - Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn and Tim Robbins - all playing the anchormen of rival TV stations in San Diego during the 1970s. With their news teams, they get into a street fight with each other and with the news teams of the city's most successful station, whose anchorman is the hugely self-regarding Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell). The plot hinges on the arrival of the station's first woman reporter (Christina Applegate), who disconcerts the dumb, macho men and takes over from Burgundy. Scripted and directed by Adam McKay, a former head writer for Saturday Night Live , the movie is a mixture of outrageous vulgarity and bizarre surrealism, linked by longueurs and non sequiturs. A dog that talks Spanish and can converse with bears is a typical joke. Finally, two stories of sado-masochistic love, one kind of familiar, the other not. The former, Carmen, goes back to Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e's novel of 1846 and brings M\u00e9rim\u00e9e himself into the story as he makes an archaeological expedition to southern Spain. He meets Jos\u00e9, who's hiding out as a bandit in the woods. Some weeks later, he listens to his tragic story as the disgraced soldier waits in a Seville jail to be garrotted for murder. Between these events, Prosper encounters Carmen (the stunning Paz Vega), who steals his watch and tries to get Jos\u00e9 to kill him. It's well made, handsomely produced and rather dull. There's not a note of music from the world's most popular opera; here Carmen strips as often as her operatic opposite number sings. It should have been subtitled 'More the M\u00e9rim\u00e9e' or 'Bizet Doing Nothing'. Four months ago, Kim Ki-Duk's latest film, Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter... and Spring, opened here. It's a sublime allegory set on a remote Korean lake, the same locale as his nasty, earlier picture, The Isle. Here the lake is dotted with rafts supporting small, colour-coded huts where men fish and entertain whores. Selling them bait and occasionally sex is the lake's guardian, a malevo lent mute girl given to sadistic tricks and homicide. Real violence against animals (some of it censored) and simulated violence among people is of an extreme kind. A criminal fugitive stuffs half-a-dozen fish-hooks into his mouth; the mute girl who falls in love with him does the same to her vagina. Each hook has to be painfully removed, in both cases as a prelude to sex. This is quite literally truly an in-your-face movie - the camera lurks just below the surface of the water when a fisherman defecates into the lake.
