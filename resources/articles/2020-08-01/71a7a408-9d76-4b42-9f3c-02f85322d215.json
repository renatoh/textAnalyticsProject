Moore was found to have entered areas at Goodwood where he was not supposed to be, in breach of British Horseracing Authority guidelines intended to minimise the risk of spreading Covid-19, but his punishment was a fine of \u00a3750, whereas it emerged this week that the regulator had asked for a three-month racecourse ban. Was Moore outraged that the BHA wanted such a stringent punishment? Evidently not. \u201cI\u2019d have been delighted, to be honest,\u201d Moore told The Guardian. \u201cI hate going racing, there\u2019s no point in going racing at the moment. The only people who are there are the BHA and their security men. There\u2019s no fun in going racing, so I\u2019d have been fine. \u201cOK, I admit, I probably did wrong. It wasn\u2019t signposted, owners here and trainers there. I just went up into the stand, there was not another person there. And then, because I had a yellow wristband on, some guy said: \u2018You shouldn\u2019t be here\u2019.\u201d The BHA\u2019s preparation of its case against Moore came in for unusual criticism from the disciplinary panel, who noted: \u201cIt is a fundamental rule of natural justice that a person charged with misconduct should be informed precisely what he is alleged to have done and the law, rules or regulations he has thereby contravened ... These requirements were not fulfilled in this case.\u201d When the BHA asked for Moore to be banned from tracks for three months, the panel doubted whether it had any such power. All in all, the case went so poorly for the regulator that Moore now feels he might have escaped punishment altogether if he had hired a barrister rather than representing himself. \u201cI probably didn\u2019t do a very good job of that ...\u201d Frustrated by the outcome, the BHA insists its rules make clear that trainers can be excluded for such behaviour. \u201cWe will be working to understand the implications of last week\u2019s hearing upon our ability to effectively enforce the Covid-19 protocols, an area which is of vital importance and under considerable scrutiny in other sports at present,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cIt is of fundamental importance to ensure there is clarity around what penalties can and cannot be imposed.\u201d \u201cUnless owners can go, I just won\u2019t go racing,\u201d Moore added. \u201cI don\u2019t see any point. You take one step over the line, you\u2019re in the wrong place. I\u2019ve been going racing a long, long time now. I know where I want to go but maybe I\u2019ll end up in the wrong place, so it\u2019s better if I don\u2019t go.\u201d In the meantime, he is worried about whether the sport can retain its vital ownership base under such circumstances. \u201cI\u2019ve never known a sale in Newmarket in August but there\u2019s 774 horses going to the \u2018horses in training\u2019 sale in a fortnight\u2019s time. That\u2019s a hell of a lot of horses and you\u2019ve got big batches from big yards.\u201d Friday\u2019s best bets There\u2019s quite a few non-runners at Ponte-carlo, where, as with Salisbury on Thursday, the ground will be fast because the rain has missed the track. Mr Orange (1.45) still faces 10 rivals, however. Don\u2019t these opposing trainers realise he\u2019s been napped by The Guardian? Something about this place seems to be good for him, as he won twice there last summer and returned to form there a fortnight ago with a close third. He\u2019s 5lb below his last winning mark and should show it today at 11-4. The staying handicap has been reduced to just four and this might be where Revolver runs out of ammo. Sir Mark Prescott\u2019s handicapper has been on a great winning run but is more than two stones higher than when it started in June and, in these circumstances, might be vulnerable to the better pace of Frankenstella (3.20), who could have been raised more than 7lb for the way she bolted up here last time. She\u2019s 7-4. Pick of the Chester card may be Strait Of Hormuz (4.40), whose effort in fifth at Ascot last time suggested this step up in trip was the way to go. The 3-1 isn\u2019t giving much away, alas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
