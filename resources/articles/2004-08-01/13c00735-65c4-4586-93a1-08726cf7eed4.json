The Czech international, who was the leading scorer at Euro 2004, met with his new manager during the club's pre-season tour of the United States last week to discuss his immediate future. While he remains committed to the Merseysiders for the moment, he stressed to Benitez during those talks that he would be keen to move to Camp Nou should the tentative interest shown by Barcelona in him last month be followed by a firm bid. \"The manager simply asked me about my future and what would happen if Barcelona came in for me,\" said Baros. \"I said I would stay at this club if anyone else came in for me but, if it was Barcelona, it would be nice to move there. When I was a kid it was always my dream to play for them. I wanted to play in England and for Barcelona - now my first dream has been achieved.\" Barcelona made a bid for the Cameroon international striker Samuel Eto'o at the weekend, though that transfer could yet be complicated by the fact that he is owned jointly by Real Mallorca and Real Madrid. That may prompt the Bar\u00e7a president Joan Laporta to return to Baros as an alternative target having been impressed by the forward's performances in Portugal. The 22-year-old scored five times to propel his country to the semi-final stage at Euro 2004, though that record contrasts starkly with a tally of 14 goals in 61 appearances since he moved to Anfield from Banik Ostrava in December 2001. Much of his time at the club has been spent as a substitute and he would have handed in a transfer request this summer had G\u00e9rard Houllier not been removed as manager. \"I wanted to leave and would have done had the manager not changed,\" he admitted. \"But after Euro 2004 I came back here to find a new situation at the club. I've spoken to Rafael Ben\u00edtez and I like life at Liverpool - I've learned the language, I get on well with the fans, and it's a big club - but you can't be at Liverpool for 10 or 12 years. That doesn't happen in football these days. \"You move clubs. Everyone does during their career. I'm still here and ready to play for Liverpool, but there is a month before the transfer window closes and we'll see what happens. \"To move to Barcelona would be nice but, if it doesn't happen, I will stay here and will fight for my place. Liverpool need more than two strikers because we are going to play so many games, and we'll see who is going to play as first-choice.\" Michael Owen expects to agree a contract extension with Liverpool before the start of the Premiership season next week. \"The reality is we have only had four or five meetings and that is normal during contract negotiations,\" said Owen. \"Another [meeting] is planned for next week. We are in no rush. We are closer than we were, but we are not there yet because the contract has not been signed.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
