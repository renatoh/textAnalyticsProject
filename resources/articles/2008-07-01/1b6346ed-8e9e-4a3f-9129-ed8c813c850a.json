In Dorset the chic Camp Bestival began yesterday, while in Hampshire punters at the Glade festival will be partying into the early hours of tomorrow morning. In Suffolk the sophisticated Latitude has been enlivening the village of Beccles; revellers there spun hula-hoops in the sun yesterday. It is not only music. People flocked to Scarborough in North Yorkshire to celebrate coastal life while others gathered in Shropshire for a storytelling festival. Many more travelled abroad for Benicassim in Valencia, Spain, where half the festival-goers are predicted to be British."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
