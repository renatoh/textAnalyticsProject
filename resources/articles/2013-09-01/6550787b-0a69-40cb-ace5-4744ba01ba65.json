It is the latest salvo in ENRC's lawsuit against Judge, launched in July, which alleges he deliberately disclosed details of company board meetings to the media. Judge filed a counter claim this month denying the accusation and accusing the mining firm of libel. Fresh ENRC court documents detail alleged transcripts of conversations between Judge and a journalist dating back to October 2011, in which ENRC claims he reveals the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) had begun examining the company's affairs months before it was publicly known. The court documents claim Judge told the journalist the \"SFO were very tough on the company\" and that it had encouraged ENRC to make a \"voluntary report, which means they own up to everything\". ENRC said it has recordings of the conversations, but Judge's lawyers denied he was a party to them. They added that he denied the new accusations. The public disclosure that the SFO had begun looking at ENRC was not made public until December 2011. A criminal investigation into allegations of \"fraud, bribery and corruption\" at ENRC was announced by the SFO in April 2013."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
