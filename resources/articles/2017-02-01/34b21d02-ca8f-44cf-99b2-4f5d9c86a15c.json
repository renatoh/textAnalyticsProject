The Bangkok Post reported that the couple were riding the jetskis off Kata beach in Phuket on Sunday afternoon. The woman who died was identified as a Victorian woman, Emily Jayne Collie, 20, and her partner as Tommy Keating. Lifeguards gave her first aid on the beach before taking her to a nearby hospital but she died en route. Local media reported that Collie suffered severe neck and shoulder injuries. In a police statement, Keating said the glaring sun had blinded their vision. A spokesman for Katon fire and rescue department told the media there would be a postmortem examination, and that Collie\u2019s family in Australia had been informed of her death. \u201cPeople on the beach tried to rescue her and send her to a hospital,\u201d Patiwat Yodkwan, a senior police officer, told AFP, adding that her partner was not seriously injured in the accident. \u201cWe are still investigating the cause of the accident. The boyfriend is in mourning \u2026 so we cannot ask him much.\u201d Friends of Collie, a student at Charles Sturt University, paid tribute to her on social media. \u201cCannot even accept that this has happened,\u201d Collie\u2019s friend Steph Hanlon wrote. \u201cSuch a beautiful and strong girl and I feel so blessed to have once been so close with you. Emily Jayne Collie you will forever be loved, hope there\u2019s a nice big trampoline up there for you xxxx.\u201d Keating\u2019s sister, Bree Lyon, told Fairfax Media the family was \u201cabsolutely devastated\u201d about the death of \u201cour darling girl with those beautiful curls\u201d. \u201cFrom the very moment I met you I loved you, I cherished your genuine heart, and that beautiful smile,\u201d Lyon said. \u201cI was inspired by you in so many ways, my darling girl, you were so strong and so determined. \u201cI miss you so much, Emily. I truly do. I love how you loved my brother, the way you looked into his eyes with nothing but pure love, it was the truest thing I\u2019ve ever been grateful to witness.\u201d Keating suffered minor injuries in the accident. Collie previously attended Goulburn Valley grammar school in Shepparton and was reportedly from Kyabram, 200km north of Melbourne. \u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday 7 February.
