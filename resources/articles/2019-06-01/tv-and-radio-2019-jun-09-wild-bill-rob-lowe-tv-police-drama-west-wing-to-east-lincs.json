And it\u2019s true. But we are not talking Boston, Massachusetts. This is Boston, Lincolnshire, population 35,124; a town that is about to win new fame because an American cop, with a very familiar face, has been flown in to take charge of the local police force. Hollywood star Rob Lowe plays Bill Hixon, an experienced American police detective who would be much better suited to the larger Boston and so has plenty of adjusting to do in ITV\u2019s new drama series Wild Bill, which starts on Wednesday. \u201cEveryone really does know each other in our Boston,\u201d said Bronwyn James, who plays Lowe\u2019s police sidekick, Muriel, in the series and who grew up two hours away in Wakefield, Yorkshire. \u201cMy character is already part of the community. She is a detective, but she grew up on a farm.\u201d The crime drama, which is also executive produced by the former West Wing star, will restore the Lincolnshire town\u2019s significance on the map as the original Boston, the place from which the upstart American city takes its name. \u201cThere have been very few, if any, TV shows centred in the Lincolnshire area,\u201d Lowe has noted. \u201cThe characters that populate our show are not the people you think of when you think of London. They live in a very different world that does not get the spotlight shone on it very often.\u201d But Lowe\u2019s new beat, around Boston\u2019s rain-soaked marketplace, taking in the ancient tower of St Botolph\u2019s and the Herbert Ingram memorial, could soon be as well known to television viewers as the West Wing corridors he once walked with Martin Sheen. His co-star, James, told the Observer that the surrounding Lincolnshire countryside should really get top billing. \u201cThe old church tower pops up in the background. But the most notable thing in the show is all the flat fields, miles and miles of them. It screams Boston, Lincs, to me,\u201d said James, 24. \u201cIf anything, Boston is being celebrated.\u201d Inspiration for the series came from David Cameron\u2019s short-lived plan to bring in an American \u201csupercop\u201d, Bill Bratton, to run the Metropolitan police. The show\u2019s creators were then also prompted to pick Boston as a location when the town earned the label \u201cthe home of Brexit\u201d, due to its high proportion of Leave voters in the 2016 referendum. Lowe has said the series depicts a place \u201cin turmoil and transition\u201d, with unexpected levels of crime and unemployment. It is, he added, \u201ca world looking for its identity.\u201d In Wild Bill, Lowe\u2019s cop moves to Boston, a place he describes as \u201ca godforsaken cabbage patch\u201d, with his 14-year-old daughter, Kelsey, in search of escape from a painful recent past. The 55-year-old actor was keen to make a series addressing divisions and inequalities in a community and one which also has echoes of the classic western plot, with a new sheriff riding into town. Lowe\u2019s fast-talking character has a degree in criminology, a masters in psychopathology and a doctorate in statistical mapping, and is determined to drive through a series of budget cuts. Each episode he and James\u2019s character tackle a different police case, but a key element of the comedy comes from seeing an American cop operating so far outside his comfort zone. And the actor claims he did not need to pretend to fail to understand his new environment: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have one idea what people were saying. I was literally like my character.\u201d Lowe has, in fact, worked in Britain before. He had his big break 35 years ago in Oxford Blues, filmed in the university town. James took particular pleasure in introducing the famous actor to north country vocabulary. \u201cHe loved the slang words,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had to explain them to him. \u2018What does that mean? That is so cool,\u2019 he\u2019d say. He\u2019d never heard the word \u2018victuals\u2019 used for food before. But he was really quick to pick up on things.\u201d James\u2019s own father is a policeman in Wakefield and she said her mother, a teacher, was even more excited than her daughter by the thought that Lowe was involved in the project. \u201cWhen they filmed a scene in the middle of town the cast were all buzzing the next day from the reception they had. People were giddy with it,\u201d said James, who describes Lowe as a very down-to-earth member of the cast, yet one who was full of \u201cvery American energy\u201d. Series writer Jim Keeble said \u201cthe absurdity of putting Rob Lowe in Lincolnshire\u201d was key to the show\u2019s appeal, but argues it is also about what Boston brings out in him and what he brings out in the place. \u201cWe are very divided as societies both here and in the US, and this show seeks not only to demonstrate that divide but also bring the two sides together. It\u2019s not always harmonious, but it does stir the pot.\u201d The port town of Boston in England was named after Saint Botolph, said to have founded the city. It is a contraction of Botwulf\u2019s Stone or Botwulf\u2019s tun, an Old English word for a hamlet. The Boston in America was founded in 1630 by the Massachusetts Bay Company. Several of the leading colonists wanted to name their capital after their English birthplace. Sailors later called the area \u201cbeantown\u201d, because of the dish frequently served to visitors. The English town, of course, is famous for a different foodstuff. As Rob Lowe has proclaimed: \u201cThe Lincolnshire sausages. You cannot beat them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
