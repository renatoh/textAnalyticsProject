The shadow cabinet will discuss Brexit on Wednesday, with the Labour leader under intense pressure from shadow ministers including Watson, Emily Thornberry and Keir Starmer to signal more clearly his support for a fresh referendum. They will receive the second part of a polling presentation that began at last week\u2019s meeting, underlining the fact that Labour\u2019s vote is being squeezed both by the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit party. Corbyn\u2019s team postponed the planned meeting on Monday, as his deputy gave a provocative speech saying: \u201cOur members are remain, our hearts are remain, our values are remain.\u201d Even some of Corbyn\u2019s closest allies, including John McDonnell and Diane Abbott, have been urging him to shift towards more wholehearted backing for a referendum, or risk endangering the party\u2019s prospects in a general election, which could come within months. Two senior Labour sources told the Guardian that Andrew Fisher, Corbyn\u2019s trusted policy chief, had also mooted a shift towards a more pro-remain stance, arguing that Labour\u2019s nuanced message had landed poorly with both remain and leave voters. In the wake of the party\u2019s dire performance in last month\u2019s European parliament elections, when it picked up just 14% of the vote, Corbyn did outline a shift in position, towards advocating a \u201cpublic vote\u201d on any Brexit deal. But he subsequently said a referendum was \u201csome way off\u201d, and disgruntled grassroots members are still organising vigorously to try to put pressure on the leadership at the party\u2019s autumn conference. The Guardian understands Corbyn will flesh out and develop that position \u2013 a public vote on any Brexit deal agreed by a future government, Tory or Labour \u2013 in a speech, perhaps as soon as this week. However, several shadow cabinet members, including Jon Trickett, Ian Lavery and Angela Rayner, remain wary about the impact on Labour voters in leave-supporting constituencies. Some are also anxious about appearing to cave in to Watson, whom they believe is using Brexit as a \u201cwedge\u201d issue, to undermine Labour members\u2019 support for Corbyn\u2019s leadership. There is little prospect of an immediate challenge to Corbyn, but some allies fear that a pro-remain candidate \u2013 perhaps Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary \u2013 could in future win over remain-supporting members who are concerned about the party\u2019s stance. However, the party\u2019s poor result in May has contributed to a change of heart among some shadow cabinet ministers who had previously been wary of a referendum. Richard Burgon has told colleagues he believes the emergence of Boris Johnson as the frontrunner to be Britain\u2019s next prime minister makes it easier for Labour to make the argument that the public should be given another say. Meanwhile Watson took his argument to Twitter on Tuesday, publishing a video in which he chatted with young people about their views on Europe, and asked them what the shadow cabinet \u2013 of which he is a member \u2013 should do. \u201cThe verdict: be bolder, be braver. We have to take a stand,\u201d he said. The debate over Labour\u2019s policy has been sharpened in the wake of the European elections, when Vince Cable\u2019s Lib Dems overtook Labour with a clear \u201cbollocks to Brexit\u201d slogan. McDonnell tweeted immediately afterwards: \u201cCan\u2019t hide from hit we took last night. Bringing people together when there\u2019s such a divide was never going to be easy. \u201cNow we face prospect of Brexiteer extremist as Tory leader &amp; threat of no deal, we must unite our party &amp; country by taking issue back to people in a public vote.\u201d However, Thornberry was dropped as Corbyn\u2019s stand-in at prime minister\u2019s questions earlier this month after strongly criticising the party\u2019s campaign in a TV appearance on polling day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
