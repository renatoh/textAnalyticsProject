If, against most sensible expectations, he wins his 18th major here at 33, and in front of his wife and their two sets of young twins, the Swiss will do no more than deliver what his millions of fans expect of him in every grand slam tournament. Even in his worst season, 2013, when he won just one minor tournament, failed to trouble his peers in the second week of the four slams and tumbled towards the lower reaches of the top 10, Federer\u2019s fans did not lose hope. Nor did he \u2013 although he did have his doubts. The performance that restored his faith was the Wimbledon final this year \u2013 his first appearance in a slam decider since he beat Andy Murray there in 2012. He did not win but he gave Novak Djokovic a serious scare over five competitive sets. He believes he can win his sixth US Open title, to add to the five in a row he won from 2004. It would be the achievement of the year, no doubt. Murray, for one, is not writing him off. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me [that many people expect him to win this US Open] because it has happened in the past with great players,\u201d said Murray, who is on the other side of the draw. \u201c[Andre] Agassi was one of them. [Jimmy] Connors made a great run here when he was 39.\u201d As did Pete Sampras in 2002, pulling off one of the great farewells by beating Agassi in the final, although he had his share of luck. There are some who think Federer might walk away from the game if he emulates Sampras this year. I very much doubt it. Federer loves the game too much. It is why he\u2019s playing so well. What separates Federer further from the herd is his ability to play without apparent physical trauma, apart from occasional back pain, which contributed to his poor run last year. \u201cEverybody\u2019s body works differently,\u201d Murray said. \u201cSome guys, by the time they get to 30, their bodies are burnt out and some of them, like Roger, with the way that he moves and the way that he plays, he doesn\u2019t put as much stress and strain through his body. \u201cIt has been impressive how he has responded since last year. I wasn\u2019t among them but a lot of people were writing him off and saying he wouldn\u2019t win another major. But he proved at Wimbledon that he can still do it. He was extremely close there and he has played great in the run up to this as well.\u201d Federer probably has not had a kinder draw in a long while, either, benefiting from moving up to second seed in the absence of Rafael Nadal. First he plays Marinko Matosevic, and there are not many serious problems for him until the quarter-finals, where he is likely to run into face Grigor Dimitrov. That might be where his run ends, however. As for Murray, he has a rematch on Louis Armstrong Court on Monday against the Dutchman who took the first two sets off him when they met in the second round here three years ago, Robin Haase. Both remember it as a strange encounter: Haase gambling with a high-power start then Murray finding his rhythm to breeze through the concluding three sets. He has been more relaxed leading into this tournament than any for a long time. His coaching relationship with Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo looks to be bedding in well \u2013 she was with him during his Miami training block, having agreed to extend the arrangement the day after he left Wimbledon \u2013 and he says he is open to her suggestion that he add variety to his solid all-court game. On Friday, Murray took a rest from his training to watch Rory McIlroy in The Barclays across the state line at the Ridgewood Country Club and later joined the Irish golfer for a front-row seat at Madison Square Garden, where the United States played Puerto Rico in an exhibition basketball match. Naturally sociable if shy, Murray likes talking to other athletes because he gets to trade knowledge about technique, attitude and training. \u201cHe\u2019s a very nice guy,\u201d Murray said of McIlroy. \u201cI have met him a couple of times before at some of the tournaments. He is enjoying himself just now. He has played great the last few months, and I\u2019m happy for him. \u201cWe are both in individual sports and there has been a lot of expectation on both of us over the last few years. It is nice and can be helpful to talk to other athletes in different sports. I find it interesting and it can give you a different way of looking at things. I enjoyed spending time with him. \u201cYou watch him live but then you speak to him and can see he is a totally normal guy. He\u2019s not different to anyone else, just incredibly gifted at golf. He obviously works extremely hard at it as well. You see him playing with Bubba Watson and Jimmy Walker. He is hitting the ball 30 or 40 yards further than Walker, who is a fantastic golfer, and that\u2019s special, you can\u2019t teach that. He\u2019s a small guy and not incredibly strong but he has incredible technique and timing. it was great to watch.\u201d On Saturday, Murray was on court at Flushing Meadows with Serena Williams, Jack Sock and Victoria Azarenka in a target challenge as part of Arthur Ashe Kids\u2019 Day (and slightly miffed finishing behind Williams). He has done this sort of thing before and enjoys it, but on Monday he will have to be on his game from the first shot, because Haase is determined to come at him hard again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
