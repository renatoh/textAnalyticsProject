The move would park the business, which generates about half of Filtronic profits, on the doorstep of its main customer Nokia. The antenna business is not seen as core to growth hopes - much of which rest with the wireless infrastructure division. Filtronic hopes a rapid take-up of 3G will provide a rich seam for this arm of the business, which specialises in base stations across network territories. Cazenove has been hired to advise on the wisdom of a float which would see Filtronic lose almost \u00a360m of its \u00a3240m revenues. A shareholder meeting yesterday was told first- half trading is likely to be in line with expectations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
