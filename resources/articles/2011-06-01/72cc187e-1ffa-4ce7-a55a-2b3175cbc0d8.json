It would take the young Ulsterman years to get over his collapse, they said. He and his game might never recover. So much for the experts. Over the past four days, Mr McIlroy has gone right back out and won the next major tournament in the golfing calendar, the US Open. Won it, what's more, in another spectacular lead-from-the-front performance that dwarfs what he nearly achieved at Augusta. Done it, moreover, aged 22 and with the maturity of someone twice that age. And done it, most remarkably, without apparently changing any aspect of his big-hitting game and endearing style. Mr McIlroy's brilliant victory last night was achieved in precisely the same swashbuckling way that he always plays. It is also a vindication of the human capacity to get over a bad experience, a textbook endorsement of the claim that the best thing to do after a fall is get back on a horse, and dreadful news for trauma counsellors and sports psychologists everywhere. It is amazing luck for golf that, just when the greatest player of the era, Tiger Woods, has gone into apparent eclipse and the greatest player of the generation before, Severiano Ballesteros, has died, a ready-minted new cult figure should have stepped forward in the improbable shape of a Dennis the Menace lookalike from Ulster."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
