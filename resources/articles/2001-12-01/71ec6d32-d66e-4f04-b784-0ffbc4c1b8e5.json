Mr Blair does agree. 3.02 For the third week running, Iain Duncan Smith attacks the prime minister over the health service, accusing him of \"fiddling the figures\" and a \"culture of deceit\", adding: \"Weasel as much he likes, the fact is the whole country is on a waiting list, waiting for him to deliver.\" 3.09 Ian Luke (Labour, Dundee East) asks if the prime minister supports a multi-faith memorial to the victims of September 11th. Mr Blair points out that tomorrow marks 100 days since the terrorist attacks, and that the al-Qaida terrorist network is \"effectively destroyed\", the Taliban is \"gone\" and that there has been \"good out of evil.\" 3.11 Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat leader, uses both his questions on the NHS, to attack the managers who should be \"out on their ear\" rather than receiving pay-offs. 3.15 Julie Kirkbride (Conservative, Bromsgrove) recently a mother herself, tells the prime minister: \"We have both been blessed by baby boys.\" Her point is about the government's endorsement of the combined MMR vaccination for toddlers. Whilst Mr Blair, his health secretary, Alan Milburn, and others have refused to answer newspaper queries as to whether their children have had the jab. Ms Kirkbride continues: \"Is the legitimate desire to protect the privacy of children [cheers] at odds with the government's MMR programme? \"Has little Leo had the MMR jab?\" Mr Blair replies: \"I'm afraid I'm not going to enter into public discussion of that.\" Gordon Brown, sat next to the prime minister, and a father-to-be, nods. 3.17 In response to a question from Colin Challen (Labour) about whether there should be a universal human right to free health care, Mr Blair is barracked by the Tories, and replies: \"I know a couple of days is a long time in the development of opposition policy.\" 3.20 Iain Duncan Smith returns to the fray, asking if the Sun's report today that the prime minister will sack the transport secretary in the New Year is true. \"No\" replies Mr Blair. 3.26 The Speaker, after one unsuccessful earlier intervention, cuts off Labour MP Ronnie Campbell, for taking too long to ask his question concerning a constituent, whose family have been split up. 3.30 Bristol's Valerie Davey (Labour, Morley and Rothwell) asks the PM not to support \"any proposal which will increase the debt of Tanzania.\" The prime minister says the proper licensing conditions will be met."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
