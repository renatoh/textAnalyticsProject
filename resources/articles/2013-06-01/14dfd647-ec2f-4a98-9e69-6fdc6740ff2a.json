The official investigation of the watchdogs finds that some of those being detained are as young as 14. The majority in a 70-strong sample said they were held after either attempting suicide or self-harm, or indicating that they were thinking of doing so. The joint report by the police, prisons and health service inspectorates, published on Tuesday, says that police custody is regularly used to detain people whose only crime is that they are suffering from a mental disorder. The report, entitled A Criminal Use of Police Cells?, says that \"place of safety\" powers, under section 136 of the 1983 Mental Health Act, make clear that people should be detained in a hospital or another health facility to be medically assessed and that police cells should be used only in exceptional circumstances. The inspectors say that mentally ill people spend an average of 10 hours, 32 minutes in police custody, and that they are kept in the same type of cells and subjected to the same processes and procedures as people who have been arrested. \"The only difference is that they are ill, not suspected criminals,\" the inspectors say. The report's publication follows the announcement last month by the home secretary, Theresa May, of a drive to end the use of police cells \"as places of safety\" for mentally ill people. May has estimated that police officers spend 15% to 25% of their time dealing with people with mental health problems. According to the inspectors' report, in many of the 70 cases examined in detail no reason was given why detainees were held in police cells. But the most common explanations were shortages of hospital staff or available beds, or that the person detained had drunk alcohol or was displaying violent behaviour, or had a history of doing so. The report says that in 2011-12 more than 9,000 people were detained under section 136, and 16,035 were taken to hospital to await assessment. In one case a custody sergeant told inspectors that he was so concerned about the welfare of a 17-year-old, detained overnight, he had put an officer outside his cell to monitor him. There had been no one from mental health services available to assess the teenager. Kevin Huish, of the Police Federation, said that police officers did not wish to detain people under the Mental Health Act but were all too often forced to do so due to a lack of provision in other services. \"This is unacceptable for the officer, the individual and the public,\" Huish said. \"This is an issue which has been identified by the government as a serious problem \u2026 This matter needs to be addressed and it needs to be addressed urgently.\" A Home Office spokesman said: \"We are already working on a range of measures to ensure that people with mental health problems get the care they need. \"These include providing suitable places of safety in every local area and piloting street triage services where mental health nurses accompany police officers to incidents.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 25 June 2013 to correct the date of the 1983 Mental Health Act.
