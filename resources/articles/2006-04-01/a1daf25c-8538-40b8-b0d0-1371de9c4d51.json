Yes, a disproportionate amount of fighting goes on, but there's a lot more to games than most non-players imagine. Unfortunately, only the violent elements are broadcast to the public, but educators are increasingly adapting game products for the classroom. Games feature an inimitable interactivity, which puts a player in an environment where he must learn the correct path towards advancement. Controversy surrounds this potential for 18+ games, but in the context of the curriculum, the potential for learning is great. According to BBC statistics from last year, 59% of people between the ages of six and 65 play games - 26.5 million in the UK - and most play between one and five times a week. The Department for Education and Skills has worked with designers to develop interactive learning software. Its foreign language product Sonica, released in 2004, integrated Spanish lessons with more than 200 interactive games. Evaluations maintain that it has increased participation, improved skills and inspired independent learning. Other initiatives have engaged students in subjects from zoology to space travel using virtual hands-on techniques. The instant feedback of games is far more engaging than writing an English essay. Furthermore, players are progressively able to put their unique footprints on game worlds. Developers may impose the context and spectrum of activities, but increasingly their roles are as advisers. The player is constantly challenged and engaged, and is the master of his progression. This makes for a compelling product, and, with a little adaptation, digital canvasses could become effective learning environments. Adaptation is a cheaper alternative to creating bespoke software, and \"unofficial\" use of off-the-shelf products in lesson plans has been growing. Dance mat games have increased attendance in PE classes. Tim Rylands, a west country primary school teacher, won the 2005 Becta award for ICT in Practice using Ubisoft's commercial fantasy role-playing title Myst to support literacy and communication. His innovative use of gaming technology helped Chew Magna School achieve third place in the country's league tables. Further afield, virtual witnesses are cross-examined by journalism students at the University of Minnesota after simulated accidents in NeverWinter Nights. Such examples challenge the stereotype of games as destructive media. And Gamesblog is keen to hear more experiences. The more the positive benefits of gaming are talked about, the greater likelihood we'll learn something. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
