They are a winning combination. In Fatal Voyage, the third bloody offering from Reichs, Dr Temperance Brennan, a forensic anthropologist, is called to the scene of a plane accident in the mountains of North Carolina. In her attempt to put together the pieces of the crash victims, she comes across a foot which appears to have no owner. Before she knows it, 'Tempe' has been thrown off the case in disgrace, her reputation in tatters. She determines to continue her investigations illegitimately, however, helped by blue-eyed police officer and one-time lover Jack Ryan. Her search for the truth leads Tempe to a deserted house and a company called H&amp;F, 'a hybrid of Mensa and the millionaire's boys club'. Mix this with a little bit of English history and - hey presto - you have the answer to the question. But what is the question? There are so many things going on, and so many people dead, that this is not a simple matter of unravelling the plot as the clues come tumbling in, but of witnessing Reichs weave a complex and evil tapestry. All the listener can do is sit back, enjoy the gore and admire the finished article."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
