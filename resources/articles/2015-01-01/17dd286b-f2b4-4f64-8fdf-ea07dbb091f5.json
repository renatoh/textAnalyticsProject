One Sunday morning in Freetown, the president of the Sierra Leone Football Association \u2013 one of only two female FA presidents in the world \u2013 was looking through the newspapers when her husband read aloud a story about an outbreak of a virus in neighbouring Guinea. It had ravaged the population of a rural area. \u201cThese things you hear about, you think: \u2018That\u2019s so sad, I hope it sorts itself out,\u2019\u201d says the 50-year-old. But what felt like a remote problem soon came closer to home. A few weeks later, in early April 2014, Sierra Leone were due to cross the border and play Guinea in an African Under-20 Championship qualifier. Johansen was worried. \u201cA week before leaving I had talks with our competitions manager and the general secretary of the FA. I said: \u2018Maybe this is because I\u2019m a mother, I know how I would feel if my child had to go to Guinea and there\u2019s an outbreak there. I\u2019m not sure I want our boys to go. Why don\u2019t we contact the World Health Organisation and find out more?\u2019 I was told not to make a fuss.\u201d Sitting in a flat in Chelsea, a base when visiting family in London, Johansen sighs. She folds her arms on her tiny lap and shrugs. Johansen has grown used to football\u2019s incessant politicking. Soon Ebola started creeping into Sierra Leone. \u201cIt hit major towns but still the Premier League kept playing. I remember getting very jittery. I said: \u2018I don\u2019t like this. It\u2019s real. Ebola is real. People are dropping down dead.\u2019\u201d Football, Johansen feared, was the perfect breeding ground for the virus. Sweat, blood and bodily fluids on the pitch, large crowds with poor sanitation in the stands. \u201cI said we could be responsible for spreading that disease like wildfire, among supporters and players themselves. Again not much attention was paid to that. I can\u2019t go into the politics.\u201d Johansen chose to boycott fixtures, making her own personal protest. Later, in August, football was suspended altogether in Sierra Leone. Since then more than 3,100 people have died from the disease in the country, including two Premier League players. With no matches, the game was left in disarray. Most clubs stopped paying players\u2019 wages. The national team, then led by Johnny McKinstry, a 28-year-old from Northern Ireland whose efforts had enabled Sierra Leone to break into Fifa\u2019s top 50 rankings, above Senegal and Cameroon, were treated as pariahs as they attempted to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations. The Seychelles chose to forfeit their qualifier altogether rather than host Sierra Leone, and even when neutral countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo offered to provide the venue for \u201chome\u201d matches the team were subjected to chants of \u201cEbola\u201d from the stands. Opposition players refused to shake hands with Sierra Leone\u2019s players, or even exchange shirts after the match. The team were quarantined as the only guests in a hotel and struggled to make travel arrangements. The treatment was hurtful. \u201cI\u2019m a Sierra Leonean, not a virus,\u201d tweeted the Notts County defender Mustapha Dumbuya. In the end it proved too much: Sierra Leone failed to qualify for the Cup of Nations. Johansen looks sorrowful. \u201cAs Africans we need to be more supportive of each other in times of need. We all like to think that Africans unite but sometimes we fall short of that.\u201d A decade earlier Sierra Leone had been torn apart by a long and bloody civil war that left 50,000 dead. Just as the nation was getting back on its feet, Ebola struck. \u201cSierra Leoneans are used to mass pandemonium,\u201d Johansen says. \u201cThey are used to destruction, we had the war. But you could see the rebels coming. For an invisible alien like Ebola you can\u2019t see it coming and that\u2019s what made it frightening. Psychologically, that\u2019s what destabilised people. It was that not knowing. Are we all going to die?\u201d The disease \u201cripped through basic humanity\u201d, says Johansen, as mothers were told not to hold their dying children, wives separated from their husbands, families unable to bury their dead. Johansen grew up in Sierra Leone and England, moving between the two countries as she completed her education \u2013 at a convent school in Freetown, at a boarding school in Yeovil, studying in England. Having grown up in a football-obsessed household \u2013 her father cofounded one of Sierra Leone\u2019s most famous clubs, East End Lions FC \u2013 Johansen played football with her brothers. In her 20s she launched a socialist magazine called Rapture and recalls sharing a desk in Euston with the Mobo awards founder Kanya King when both were starting out. Returning to Sierra Leone, she was moved to found a football club, FC Johansen, after seeing boys who had nowhere else to go playing football in the street. In exchange for their promise to attend school, she provided them with football kit and food. The team was to become a success story when, in 2008, they won the Under-16s Swiss Cup, beating Liverpool in the final. \u201cThere\u2019s an image I\u2019ll never forget,\u201d she says, describing their first overseas trip to a tournament in Sweden. \u201cThese kids came up to the boys and they said: \u2018You! Pap pap pap!\u2019 [she gestures shooting a gun] My boys looked at me like what? \u2018You! Your mama! Pap pap pap!\u2019 They meant did you shoot your mother? Are you a child soldier? Because the European kids, even at that age, understood that these African kids had come from war. It was a gripping moment.\u201d FC Johansen grew and became a Premier League club. Some of their players have gone on to have trials at European clubs. Most recently George Davies signed for the second-tier Bundesliga side Greuther F\u00fcrth. Johansen\u2019s experiences of youth football, of seeing how the sport could change the lives of a generation whose innocence was stolen by war, encouraged her to stand for the role of association president. \u201cPeople said I would come up against a lot of problems: \u2018A woman? In Africa? That\u2019s going to be something.\u2019 But I was used to it, that was the least of my problems, what men would think. So I threw my hat in barely two weeks before the elections.\u201d The election itself proved controversial, as two well-known figures in the game \u2013 the businessman Rodney Michael and the former Internazionale striker Mohamed Kallon \u2013 were ruled ineligible candidates. In the end Johansen stood unopposed. The event left a bitter taste in the mouths of her rivals that still lingers. \u201cThere was a lot of animosity,\u201d Johansen says, shaking her head sadly. \u201cThey called themselves \u2018the aggrieved party\u2019. They wanted a stake in the football. I said: \u201cOK, fine, let\u2019s work together. We tried to bury the hatchet. But it didn\u2019t work.\u201d As news of Ebola broke in Guinea, Johansen and Kallon were involved in an altercation that rocked Sierra Leonean football. Kallon accused the diminutive president of striking him on the face; a photograph of the alleged injury appeared online. Johansen lifts up her hands. \u201cFirst of all, look at these fingers,\u201d she says, tiny hands turning over for inspection. \u201cI looked at that picture as well. I did that? How?\u201d She sighs. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m speaking about that incident publicly.\u201d At a local game, Johansen says an argument broke out between Kallon and a rival club owner. The exchange escalated and she worried that, with their groups of supporters looking on, there could be a riot. Johansen called the police. They did not come. In the end she entreated Kallon, a long-time friend, to call off his supporters and leave the stadium. He refused. As she turned to leave he grabbed her arm. She says she instinctively hit out in self-defence. The two have since made up but the infighting within domestic football continues. In December an interim body, seeking to overturn Johansen\u2019s presidency, announced to Fifa that it would be taking over the SLFA. A letter from the Fifa general secretary, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke, refused to formally recognise the collective. For Johansen the time has come for an ultimatum: \u201cEither they stay within the football family and work towards a better football or they have to bow out.\u201d The fighting has led to fallouts: a boycott of the league, sponsors withdrawing, allegations of match-fixing and ultimately the sacking of McKinstry, which Johansen says had nothing to do with her. She speaks fondly of the Northern Irishman, who is now working as a pundit on ITV\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations coverage, describing him as \u201cpassionate and genuine\u201d, but suggests he may have got caught up in the politics between the ministry for sport and the SLFA, prompting his downfall. Johansen has enough of her own problems to worry about. \u201cI used to think that some of the attacks that I had was because of my zero tolerance on corruption,\u201d says Johansen, who believes too many individuals involved in Sierra Leonean football view the national game as \u201ca milking cow\u201d. \u201cBut I\u2019m beginning to realise it is because I am a woman. \u201cIn my quiet moments I want to say: \u2018Oh gosh, poor me, why are they putting me through the grinder like this?\u2019 There are times it gets to me, yes. I\u2019ve been called a prostitute on the radio by one of these guys who calls himself a stakeholder [in football]. A journalist recently said I was a disgrace to womanhood. I\u2019m still trying to figure it out. How?\u201d She laughs. \u201cI guess because I\u2019m in a position of power. During the run-up to the elections some very hurtful things were being said. There was a time that I thought Sierra Leone was ready for women in leadership but I\u2019m beginning to think it will take a little longer.\u201d Johansen\u2019s background in youth football informs her view of what the game should be focusing on in Sierra Leone: the next generation. She wants young footballers to be better equipped with life skills and education, whether they end up overseas with a professional contract or start a new vocation altogether. Alongside FC Johansen sits another international name: the Craig Bellamy Foundation, founded in 2009 and run by McKinstry before he was appointed to coach the national side. Johansen welcomes the Bellamy academy, though it runs independently of the SLFA, but says she has reservations about its links with the gambling firm Mercury International, whose logo is on the CBF website. \u201cWe are talking about an academy where the boys are under 18. Where do we draw the line of what is legally acceptable? I stand to be corrected if I have misunderstood but I am very against minors being exposed or associated in any way whatsoever to gambling, whether through sponsorship or otherwise.\u201d With the news that Ebola is receding in Sierra Leone, there are plans for schools to reopen in March. Football, though, will have to wait. The rains come in the summer and the league still needs a sponsor. \u201cI\u2019m resigned to the fact that my four years of office, of which I\u2019ve done 18 months now, will not be a ceremonial, enjoyable ride. It\u2019s a battle axe, it\u2019s the shovel. But it\u2019s all good because somebody\u2019s got to do it, and if it means that four years on another president comes in and has a much more stable level to work from then I\u2019ll be extremely proud.\u201d Johansen pauses. \u201cI can see you\u2019re thinking: \u2018She\u2019s mad.\u2019\u201d She laughs. \u201cHad I known what I know now, this African football, the whole web, the deceit, the malfunctioning and everything, would I have gone into it? I ask myself those questions sometimes.\u201d She smiles. \u201cBut I am a very determined woman, I like a challenge. Yes, I probably still would have.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
