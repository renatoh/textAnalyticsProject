Here\u2019s an old-school, PG-rated animation, encompassing some digital wizardry, but generally clinging to a nostalgic, hand-drawn look, with a late-blooming Christmas theme. The director is the seasoned Sergio Pablos, who contributed to Disney\u2019s Hercules and Tarzan and co-wrote Illuminations\u2019 Despicable Me, and now assimilates several of those titles\u2019 most appealing aspects. It also represents a half-decent attempt to revive the angular character design and irreverent humour Disney abandoned after the commercial failure of the underrated The Emperor\u2019s New Groove. Disney\u2019s current stewards would presumably also have nixed the dismal arctic location to which our jabbering postman hero Jesper (voiced by Jason Schwartzman) is exiled. Introduced in a striking foggy monochrome (\u201cYou should see it in the spring,\u201d mutters sarcastic ferryman Norm Macdonald, \u201cThat\u2019s when those greys really pop\u201d), Smeerensburg is no magical kingdom, rather a frozen backwater. Jesper\u2019s alliance with bearded, vaguely familiar toymaker Klaus (JK Simmons) helps warm everyone\u2019s cockles, and initiates what is essentially a festive origins story, addressing the development of the flying sleigh. That\u2019s a little uninspired; stronger is Pablos\u2019 vision of a society where children go overlooked while their guardians leap at one another\u2019s throats. Solid first and third acts can\u2019t disguise a so-so middle section stuffed with conventional story beats. If Netflix has its sights set on becoming a major animation player, it needs gagwriters capable of offsetting the saccharin and bolstering the visual accomplishments. Still, there are interesting idiosyncrasies, including an unusual narrative deployment of Mrs Klaus, and a very Disneyish reach for inclusivity in the depiction of the indigenous Saami people. \u2022 Klaus is released in the UK and the US on 8 November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
