I'd like to pretend it's for dental reasons, but it's mainly so people don't pass out when they walk past. Painkillers This seems like something of a hangover drawer - but I also use these when I get a headache from staring at a screen for too long. Wipes They always come in handy.

It was just bad luck I guess. \u00b7 Hugo Walsh, an accountant, was talking to Ravi Somaiya"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
