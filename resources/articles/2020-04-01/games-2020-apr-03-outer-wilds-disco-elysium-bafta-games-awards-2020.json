Sci-fi action puzzler Outer Wilds took the best game award, as well as game design and original property. Offbeat detective adventure Disco Elysium also won in three categories: debut game, narrative and music. Other winners included space station thriller Observation for British game, Apex Legends for multiplayer and Untitled Goose Game in the family category. Metal Gear Solid game designer Hideo Kojima was awarded the Bafta fellowship, with his latest title, Death Stranding, also taking the award for technical achievement. The games beyond entertainment category was won by Kind Words, a game in which players send out anonymous letters to other members of the community, seeking help, advice and reassurance. Bafta streamed the awards over Twitter, Twitch and YouTube; winning developers delivered their acceptance speeches via video calls. The presentation was fronted by regular host Dara \u00d3 Briain, who joked: \u201cUsually these awards come from some plush conference hall in London \u2013 tonight they will take place entirely in my house from the room with the big TV where I play video games. We live in strange times.\u201d \u201cOnly two months ago we scoffed at the idea of a video game which stressed the importance of delivery people in a post-apocalyptic landscape,\u201d he said, referring to Death Stranding. \u201cYou win this one, Hideo Kojima.\u201d Winners in full Fellowship: Hideo Kojima Animation: Luigi\u2019s Mansion3 Artistic Achievement: Sayonara Wild Hearts Audio Achievement: Ape Out Best Game: Outer Wilds British Game: Observation Debut Game: Disco Elysium Evolving Game: Path of Exile Family: Untitled Goose Game Game Beyond Entertainment: Kind Words Game Design: Outer Wilds Multiplayer: Apex Legends Music: Disco Elysium Narrative: Disco Elysium Original Property: Outer Wilds Performer in a Leading Role: Gonzalo Martin as Sean Diaz in Life is Strange 2 Performer in a Supporting Role: Martti Suosalo as Ahti the Janitor in Control Technical Achievement: Death Stranding EE Mobile Game of the Year: Call of Duty Mobile"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
