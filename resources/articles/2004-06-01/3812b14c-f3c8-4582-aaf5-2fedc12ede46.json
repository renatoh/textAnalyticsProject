Thus spake Adam Singer, the Sun Tzu of new media and my old boss at Telewest. I was reminded of this last week when James Murdoch announced his 200-channel, free-to-air satellite service. It was a big week all round in new media land. One of my venture capitalist friends (that has to be an oxymoron) told me that in the US, interactive media and internet companies are being bought for six times revenues. I would love to suggest you dust down those business plans that have been sitting in your knicker drawer since March 2000, but I'm afraid the rules have changed. Buyers want revenue, solid management and real growth. The sods. But all the signs are that the money people think that new media is sexy again. Gone are the days when a banker told me that the City thinks the internet is just a big telephone exchange. Talking of telephones, the third big story of last week was BT's announcement that it was spending \u00a33bn to shift over to a complete IP-based system by 2008. When the big fixed-line fish bets on wireless, you know that wires have as much future as the next winner of Big Brother. BT does not really have a strategic choice. The wireless broadband world feels like a historical inevitability, and either it rides the tiger or the tiger has it for lunch. The old Marxist in me likes the idea of iron laws of progress, but consumers, fortunately, are fickle creatures not given to responding to the diktats of government, big business nor abstract forces of history. Wireless broadband is our future because it offers the kinds of services that we are willing to dig deep into our rich western pockets to buy. Just as people will give up fags and drugs to hang on to their broadband connection and Sky Plus box, so they'll give up their fourth Bacardi Breezer to afford an always-on roaming internet connection. But the money and risks are mind-boggling. Since 2000, Verizon, the US joint venture in which Vodafone has a significant stake, has spent over $55bn - nearly as much as we spend each year on the whole of the NHS - on building its mobile network. A few weeks ago, it acquired its 40 millionth customer, about the same number of Americans who watch network TV every day, and it is planning to spend $3bn over the coming two years to create a next-generation network to hook up all of our IP-based devices. The killer application in all this is Voice over Internet Protocol. VoIP is the email of the broadband world. It will become ubiquitous. The technology has been around for a long time as an idea, but never really worked in a narrowband environment where it was clunky, inefficient and geeky. But wireless broadband changes all that. VoIP is much less expensive for the customer, and the next generation of phones are liberated from the computer. Basically, the technology will become invisible. All customers need to know is that they can buy a phone that allows them to make cheap calls, comes with a number that works at home and on the road, and can hook up to every other IP device in the home. When I heard the Verizon strategy outlined at an Accenture conference earlier this year, I thought they had gone potty. After revealing to a shocked and hungover bunch of European business types that their new system would allow everyone's partners to know where they were at any time (yeah, right, like that's gonna happen in France and Italy), the Verizon representative laid out their vision of an \"integrated, high-speed, multimegabit network that will support the growth of the entire hi-tech industry of the future\". Wow, I thought, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again. Free cash flow chasing a monopoly dream. With BT's recent announcement and my own growing addiction to my Blackberry, which has me tied to the office 24/7 and which I consult every day before kissing the kids good morning, it has become obvious that anyone who offers customers an integrated broadband VoIP solution is going to own their wallet and credit card. While Sky carpet bombs Freeview, the main event is happening elsewhere. There really is revolution in the air. \u00b7 David Docherty is chief executive, YooMedia"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
