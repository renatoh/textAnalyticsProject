Timothy Peake, from Salisbury in Wiltshire, is one of six new recruits to join the space agency's ageing astronaut corps and was chosen from more than 8,000 applicants after a gruelling year-long selection procedure. The appointment, announced at a special ceremony at the space agency's headquarters in Paris yesterday, is surprising because Britain has a long-standing policy of refusing to fund human spaceflight. Although Britain is the fourth largest contributor to Esa, its \u00a3200m annual donation is used exclusively for satellites and robotic missions. Major Peake, who is married and has a four-month-old son, Thomas, joins the space agency after an 18-year career in the army during which he rose to become one of the force's top helicopter pilots. \"I'm absorbing what's happened and looking forward to my new role as an astronaut in Esa,\" he told the Guardian. \"I harboured a childhood dream to become an astronaut, but there's always the reality that makes you think it's never going to happen. It's an incredibly privileged position to be in.\" Peake received his commission from the Army Air Corps in 1992 and served as a platoon commander on an eight-month attachment with the Royal Green Jackets in Northern Ireland. He gained his wings in 1994 after completing the army pilots' course. Following a posting to the US, he returned to Britain in 2002 as one of the first pilots qualified to instruct trainees in flying Apache helicopters. He went on to graduate from the prestigious Empire Test Pilot School at Boscombe Down and conduct special forces operations. He retired from the army earlier this year and joined the aircraft company Augusta Westland as a senior helicopter test pilot. He has clocked up 3,000 hours of flying in more than 30 different aircraft. The six new astronauts were announced after the Esa director general, Jean-Jacques Dordain, conducted in-depth interviews with 30 candidates over the past two weeks. \"These new astronauts will become, step by step, the representatives of Europe in space,\" said Dordain as he announced the recruits at yesterday's press conference. The astronauts, including five men and a woman, will begin 18 months of intensive training in September, during which they will learn to work on the International Space Station and to fly aboard Russia's Soyuz rocket, which from next year will be the only means of transporting astronauts to and from the orbiting outpost. The next stage of training will ready them for specific space missions. It will be at least three-and-a-half years before any of the astronauts take part in an orbital mission. More distant ambitions in the pipeline at Nasa and Esa mean the new recruits could be among the first to walk on the moon since the end of the Apollo missions in 1972. Esa's decision to select a British astronaut will put pressure on the UK government to contribute to the agency's human space programme. Other nations contribute significant sums to be involved in the astronaut programme. Mr Dordain said: \"When we have top candidates, even when they are Brits, we cannot refuse a good one. It is clear that I hope that this will stimulate the British government, because with such a good guy, how can they continue to not contribute?\" But Lord Drayson, the science minister, said yesterday that there had been no change in government space policy. \"It's not costing the British taxpayer an additional penny to do this, but it is brilliant that we have now got an official British astronaut,\" he said. \"We believe that space is extremely important both scientifically and economically in the future, but we have chosen to focus on those areas where we believe the UK can most effectively contribute.\" In 1991, Helen Sharman became the first Briton to go into orbit, in a one-off deal between the government and the Russian space agency. The chemist from Mars \u2013 the confectionery company \u2013 visited the Mir space station, which a decade later plunged into the South Pacific Ocean after being intentionally de-orbited in 2001. Other British-born people have visited space after gaining US citizenship and joining Nasa's astronaut corps, or by paying the Russian space agency to fly as a tourist. The three serving Nasa astronauts born in Britain are Piers Sellers, Nick Patrick and Michael Foale. The recruitment campaign will introduce much-needed fresh blood into Europe's astronaut corps, whose average age is around 50. The eight existing astronauts are all men and come from France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Sweden and the Netherlands. The new recruits may have a long wait before they are assigned to their first space mission. When the space shuttle is decommissioned next year, Esa will be competing with Nasa for seats aboard the Russian Soyuz rocket. There are only seven seats put aside for the European astronaut corps until 2020. Esa does not yet have its own means of ferrying astronauts into space, but it is investigating the possibility of making its existing Ariane rocket safe enough to carry astronauts. The five other astronauts are Samantha Cristoforetti from Italy, Alexander Guest from Germany, Andreas Mogensen, a Danish scientist working at the University of Surrey, UK, Luca Parmitano from Italy, and a Frenchman, Thomas Pesquet. Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal and president of the Royal Society, welcomed the announcement. \"It's very good news to be doing this as part of the European Space Agency,\" he said. Martin Barstow, head of science and engineering at Leicester University, said: \"This is a welcome success for the UK but will produce a political headache for the government, as the UK does not contribute to the Esa human spaceflight programme. We hope this will be an opportunity to change the current policy and for Britain to become active in the human spaceflight arena.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
