Amnesty International has warned the heavyweight he is being duped by the Saudi authorities, who it claims are launching a crackdown on human rights by repressing free speech and dissent. Joshua, who is expected to receive more than \u00a360m for his controversial WBA, IBF and WBO world title rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr in Diriyah on Saturday night, dismissed suggestions his legacy as a role model would be tarnished. \u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Joshua said. \u201cI just came here for the boxing opportunity. I look around and everyone seems pretty happy and chilled. I\u2019ve not seen anyone in a negative light out here, everyone seems to be having a good time.\u201d Joshua also appeared to not know what Amnesty International was when told the human rights organisation wanted him to research and speak out about problems in the country. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d Joshua replied in an interview with the BBC. \u201cI haven\u2019t known much about Amnesty because I\u2019ve spent most of my time in Finchley just training. But as an individual I try to bring positivity and light everywhere I go. I\u2019m just seeing it from my eyes alone but for sure the country in itself is trying to do a good job politically. \u201cFor the sporting side of things, I just feel I\u2019ve got a fight to focus on. For the future maybe I can bear a different kind of flag but at the minute it\u2019s just the world championship flag I\u2019m trying to bear.\u201d Joshua also said he would have thought twice about coming if he thought he was being used to sportswash the country. \u201cIf that was the case I\u2019d definitely have to say I would be bothered. But my only focus is just the boxing. We looked at all different venues but this was the one \u2013 I just want to do a job.\u201d Joshua\u2019s promoter Eddie Hearn denied he was promoting the regime by bringing the fight to Saudi Arabia. \u201cIt can\u2019t in any way be seen to be endorsing anything, other than our job to provide life-changing opportunities to our clients who take part in one of the most barbaric and dangerous sports that exist,\u201d Hearn said. \u201cNo journalist or media outlet can possibly tell a fighter where they can\u2019t go to earn money in a sport like this, to be honest with you. There are so many hypocrites. \u201cAnthony is going to go down in history \u2013 like the Thrilla in Manila and the Rumble in the Jungle \u2013 two events that also had similar controversy. He\u2019s going to be a pioneer and change the face of boxing in the Middle East.\u201d Claims of sportswashing were also denied by Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki al-Faisal, the chairman of the Saudi General Sports Authority, who maintained that staging the fight in Diriyah was instead part of a wider plan to inspire the population to do more sport and to open the country up as part of its Vision 2030 plans. \u201cOnly two years ago women were not allowed to get into these stadiums to watch a football match,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they are allowed and you will see a lot of women attending this fight. But it\u2019s not just that. \u201cThey are also allowed to participate and be part of a national team. Criticism will happen. We accept it and we will look at how we can make ourselves better. \u201cWe are not perfect but we are striving towards a positive future for the kingdom and that is what we are hoping to achieve.\u201d Addressing Amnesty\u2019s comments directly, he said: \u201cThe way I look at it is, we\u2019ve done a lot of changes in the past two years and I think they should embrace that. We are moving towards a better Saudi but we have to make sure we do it at the right pace and that it is within a programme that is controlled.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
