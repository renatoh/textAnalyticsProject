Asked to make 464 to win in 4 sessions - a notional figure: there was no Adam Gilchrist, Headingley-type charity here - England lost Michael Vaughan, controversially perhaps, to the third ball of the innings, Trescothick in the second over, and inside 29 overs had been dismissed humiliatingly for 79. Earlier Matthew Hayden had completed his second century of the match as Australia reached 296 for five in their second innings before Steve Waugh declared at the midpoint of the afternoon session. He thought they were capable of getting the job done before the day was out, he said, and so they pressed on because they wanted to take the weather out of the equation. Four years ago, it is true, the mother of all storms gave England an unwarranted draw but since there has been no measureable rainfall in Queensland for months, it is reasonable to assume he meant a day with the family would be nice. England will now approach the second Test in Adelaide on Thursday week with trepidation. The statistics are just depressing. The defeat, by 384 runs, was gargantuan. Only three times - against Australia at the Oval in 1934 and again in 1948, when they lost by 562 and 409 respectively, and at Old Trafford in 1976 when the West Indies inflicted a 425-run defeat on them - have England lost a Test by a greater margin, in terms of runs, than this. It is their worst ever in Australia. The second-innings total was their lowest in Australia for 99 years. The Australians, meanwhile, have now won nine of their last 10 matches and, for all that it looked as though some cracks have started to appear in the side, not least the captain who seems to be in a race with his baggy green cap to see which disintegrates first, it remains frighteningly efficient. In 1954, Len Hutton came to Brisbane, lost the first Test having, like Hussain, put the Aussies in against general advice and still went on to win the Ashes. But the manner in which Waugh's men raised their game when it mattered, and the fragile way England responded, suggests such a turnaround is beyond them. This was an infamous day for English cricket, the avowed intention of which is to become the best side in the world in both forms of the game five years hence. There are better ways to start. The simple fact is that the Australians, as a unit, played overall at a level below their accepted norm, the first prerequisite for an England success out here. On the second day, after what Hussain has described as his worst day in Test cricket, the team appeared to rally strongly as Australia were bowled out and then treated roughly in the field. They made more mistakes than they would expect all series. Yet still England were unable to take advantage, still they found themselves chasing the kangaroo's tail. Yesterday, when it really mattered, Waugh's team played the perfect game. The batting was to the point, the bowling was aggressive, technically brilliant without frills or fancy, and the catching, which had by definition been weakened by the exclusion of Mark Waugh, was fautless. Perhaps the greatest sadness is that for all the prematch rhetoric and good intentions, the demise of England's batting was just so predictable. The Australians delivered the message everyone in their hearts suspected but few wanted to hear or believe. England are not good enough to take the Ashes. Now, before Adelaide, they must go to Hobart, to regroup, analyse, lick the wounds and then play Australia A (another humiliating experience last time around). There will be opportunities for some to stake claims for the second Test, with one and, given the dreadful hammering inflicted on Matthew Hoggard, possibly two bowling places up for grabs. Much has been made of the toss and Hussain himself has been man enough to admit that in putting Australia in, he got it hopelessly, horribly wrong. But, in terms of the outcome of the match, it may have made little difference, such was the gulf between the two sides. England did not possess a batsman of the calibre, confidence or relentlessness of Hayden (batting, suggested Waugh, as well as any man in history), nor bowlers to match the genius of Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne, who took seven of the nine wickets to fall yesterday. Since his brief second-day mauling from Trescothick, Vaughan and Mark Butcher, McGrath was mighty, bowling a further 26 overs and taking seven for 66 in that time (four for 36 yesterday), giving him eight for 123 in the match. Warne, teased and twirled yesterday as conditions played into his hands, and collected three for 29. Only Butcher, for the second time in the match, played with any measure of certainty, surviving (for that is the right word) phlegmatically for almost two hours for 40 before Warne had him caught in the close cordon. By the fourth day, the cracks in the pitch had widened alarmingly and there was some erratic bounce as well as sideways movement and dusty spin for Warne. Batting was never going to be a cinch. But some of the dismissals were flaccid. England cannot claim that luck turned against them either, for if Vaughan was victim of a breakback from McGrath that struck him too high, then Hussain, for the second time in the match, was given a reprieve when he edged Jason Gillespie to the keeper and was given not out, and John Crawley, who had batted sensibly in the first innings for his unbeaten 69 was scandalously run out after a Warne delivery had scuttled down the legside, eluding everyone. Although Justin Langer dived and stopped the ball at short fine leg, there was a simple bye to take but Crawley, dithering in the crease, neither saw, nor more pertinently heard Butcher's call. The fielder threw to Gilchrist who in turn ran Crawley out with a direct hit at the bowler's end. That sort of thing just happens to losers. Butcher apart, only Hussain and Craig White reached double figures with Trescothick edging nervously to slip, Alec Stewart adding a first-ball nought to his second-ball dismissal on Saturday - the first pair of his Test career - and the tail offering no resistance. The Australian intentions were never better personified than Gilchrist's innings in the morning after Hayden had chipped a return catch to Ashley Giles. He, too, was out second ball in the first innings, but promoted up the order to accelerate things, he advanced down the pitch to his first ball and spanked it back over the bowler's head for six. He made an unbeaten 60 at his habitual run a ball, and played beautifully and ominously."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
