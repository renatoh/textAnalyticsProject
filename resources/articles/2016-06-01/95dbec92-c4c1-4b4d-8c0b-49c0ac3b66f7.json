But there\u2019s blood and then there\u2019s blood, as so emphatically illustrated by Anatomy Theater, composer David Lang and artist Mark Dion\u2019s new operetta enjoying its world premiere at Los Angeles\u2019s Redcat over five performances beginning on 16 June, part of the LA Opera\u2019s Off Grand series. \u201cThere\u2019s this moment in time when people have all these different agendas for why these anatomy lessons are taking place. We thought that would be a really interesting and provocative thing to do,\u201d Lang says of his latest, about the execution of a murderer in 17th-century England who is then dissected publicly in order to remove the malignant organs thought to be the impetus for her crime. \u201cWhat\u2019s exciting to me is through the magic of opera we can dissect this person and she can keep singing. That\u2019s something we can offer that a real anatomy lesson can\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s not as though Lang and company are in competition for gore-seeking audiences. The days of public dissection are long gone but not soon enough for the show\u2019s Sarah Osborne, sung by mezzo Peabody Southwell. Raped and beaten by her stepfather at an early age, Osborne was thrown out of her house by her mother and turned to a life of prostitution. After she married her pimp, he too beat her until one night she dispensed with him by dosing his liquor and smothering him with a pillow. When the act was done, she did the same to her two small children. As Anatomy Theater begins, she stands on the gallows about to pay for her crime. Moments later, the real work of ferreting out evil gets under way for the benefit of a paying audience. Emcee Jonathan Crouch, sung by baritone Marc Kudisch, is accompanied by anatomist Baron Peel, (bass-baritone Robert Osborne). His assistant Ambrose Strang, sung by tenor Timur, performs the dirty work of slicing into the still-warm corpse. \u201cMy biggest challenge in the piece is I then must play dead for 45 minutes while propped up on a vertical table platform while having the boys prick and prod me and shift and bump me,\u201d says Southwell who is nude throughout most of the production as her organs are extracted and examined for putrescent signs of malice. \u201cI can play dead in clothes much easier. But as all of my breathing mechanism is visible and my swallowing mechanism is visible and it\u2019s very obvious, I worked with my Pilates teacher and my meditation teacher. It\u2019s the opposite of singer breathing. I have to find this incredibly shallow breath that I can sustain for 45 minutes.\u201d For all its gore and nudity, Anatomy Theater might sound like it appeals to its audience\u2019s baser instincts but in fact it does the opposite. \u201cThe reason why this woman is executed and the reason why Donald Trump finds people to support him is because there are things in the world that we should be afraid of,\u201d explains Lang, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his choral work, The Little Match Girl Passion, as well as an Oscar nomination for Simple Song #3 in Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s movie, Youth. Produced by avant-garde avatar Beth Morrison Projects, Anatomy Theater illustrates the irrational extremes a society will go to in order to protect itself. \u201cIt seems barbaric in our opera that this is the way people deal with their fear. And yet it\u2019s something that is still present for us. And I think that\u2019s something the Donald Trump situation really shows \u2013 this fear can\u2019t go away. We can\u2019t lose our vigilance in trying to keep a deeper and more philosophical and reasoned approach to how we protect ourselves.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
