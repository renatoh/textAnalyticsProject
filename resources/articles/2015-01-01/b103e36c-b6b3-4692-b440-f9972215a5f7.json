Sam Allardyce and his increasingly happy Hammers believe they can win the Cup and are confident of progress at home where Carroll will again seek to remind Roy Hodgson he is fit, firing and good enough to offer England the option of the traditional target-man centre-forward. The muscular striker\u2019s goal at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday was a gem of the highest class and drew praise from both sides. Garry Monk, whose Swansea City team have conceded three in two games to Carroll these past five weeks, said: \u201cHe is a very good player who dominates most defenders physically \u2013 every defender if the ball in to him is right.\u201d On this occasion the not-so-gentle giant took Stewart Downing\u2019s left-wing cross on his chest, holding off Ashley Williams, then brushed past Tom Carroll and turned Federico Fern\u00e1ndez inside out on the 18-yard line in working the ball on to his favoured left foot. He then dispatched the sweetest of shots into the top left corner of Lukasz Fabianski\u2019s net. The Swansea defenders could have done a lot better but credit where it is due: Carroll demonstrated he has good, quick feet as well as a commanding presence in the air. Scored just before half-time, the goal gave West Ham a deserved lead and they would not have been flattered by three points. Instead Swansea replied late on with an equaliser they wanted to credit to Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis. The Frenchman\u2019s glancing header hit Adri\u00e1n\u2019s left-hand upright and was on its way out when Mark Noble\u2019s maladroit last touch deflected it in for what was clearly an own goal. Why was Monk so determined to give it to Gomis? Because the manager faces the herculean task of replacing Wilfried Bony, who is to join Manchester City for a \u00a325m fee rising to \u00a328m, when he returns from the Africa Cup of Nations and Gomis is the striker earmarked to do it. Monk said: \u201cBaf\u00e9 is the one who created the goal, it was a great header. He performed really well and I think he deserved the goal.\u201d Gomis celebrated the equaliser by grabbing a tricolore from the kit man and looking up to the heavens in tribute to the victims of the Paris terrorist attack. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy week for all French people and I wanted to join my country even though I don\u2019t live there any more,\u201d he said. \u201cI am happy Swansea supported me in this difficult time to provide me with the [black] armband and the French flag to show my support towards my country.\u201d He has spoken recently about the frustration of his role as Bony\u2019s understudy and has had his agent talking to other clubs but Monk is sanguine about the situation. \u201cBaf\u00e9 hasn\u2019t said anything bad, only what every agent in the world is doing. It would only bother me if he wasn\u2019t trying or his performance was affected. You can see in all the games he is playing that he is 100% with us. \u201cHe is important. He is my No1 striker now and I am looking to him for the rest of the season. Wilfried was always leaving so I had to prepare for it. Baf\u00e9 was always going to be the No1 striker with N\u00e9lson Oliveira [signed on loan from Benfica] supplementing the squad. \u201cThis is Baf\u00e9\u2019s chance to stake a claim for that shirt and if he does well enough he will keep it. We want him to stay. We want him to be a part of the future of the club.\u201d Man of the match Andy Carroll (West Ham United)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
