The second extra runway should be at Heathrow airport by 2020, providing \"stringent environmental limits\" can be met. The option to develop two or three additional runways at Stansted is not supported. The paper also rules out the construction of new runways at Gatwick and Luton and an airport at Cliffe. South-west England Bristol airport should be expanded with a runway extension and a new terminal, but a new airport north of the city is not supported. Any proposals to develop Exeter, Plymouth and Newquay airports should be decided locally. The Midlands Birmingham airport is the government's preferred location for an additional runway. A new airport between Coventry and Rugby has been ruled out. The expansion of passenger and freight operations at East Midlands airport is supported, subject to stringent controls on noise impact. The case for a new runway is not currently supported, but will be kept under review. The north of England Additional terminal capacity should be provided at Manchester airport, but should be accompanied by measures to minimise the number of people affected by noise. Capacity should also be increased at Liverpool John Lennon, Leeds Bradford and Newcastle airports. Scotland Land should be safeguarded for terminal development and an additional runway at Edinburgh airport. Substantial terminal development at Glasgow airport is supported, but the development of a new central Scotland airport has been ruled out.
