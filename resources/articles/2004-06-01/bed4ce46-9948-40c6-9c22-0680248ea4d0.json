Blackburn had expressed an interest in the 30-year-old winger during the January transfer window but it has taken until now to land the Real Sociedad player. \"As soon as we heard that De Pedro was available, Graeme Souness put him to the top of our wanted list,\" said Blackburn's chief executive John Williams. \"Consequently we ceased interest in Morten Pedersen, one of our other summer targets, and made a concerted effort to land De Pedro.\" Souness said: \"De Pedro is a proven player at the highest level and he is someone our fans should be very excited about seeing in a blue and white shirt next season. Two years ago he played in every game for Spain in the World Cup and the only reason he hasn't signed a new contract with Sociedad is because he's had a fall-out with them. \"He's a left-sided player with bags of international experience and he scores his fair share of goals from set pieces. He's got terrific ability with his left foot and two seasons ago he had the most assists in the Spanish League.\" Michael Tarnat has completed his free transfer from Manchester City to Hanover, returning to the Bundesliga after only one season in the Premiership. The 34-year-old full-back, formerly of Bayern Munich, was informed that his contract would not be extended this summer. Crystal Palace's \u00a3500,000 bid for the Dundee goalkeeper Julian Speroni has been rejected. The Scottish Premierleague club are thought to have dismissed the offer because too many strings were attached, with the full payment based on appearances. The Hull chairman Adam Pearson has revealed he is prepared to let the team's manager Peter Taylor take charge of the England Under-21 team on a part-time basis provided the FA agrees to certain conditions. He also stressed that an agreement for Taylor to take charge of the U21s was not already in place. \"We have received assurances from the FA that there are a maximum of eight or nine U21 games planned for next season and that they'll be played predominantly on Tuesday nights,\" Pearson told the club's website. \"The proposal they have put forward involves Peter working purely for those match days and not at any other time. Wigan have signed the Torquay striker David Graham after making an improved offer of \u00a3215,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
