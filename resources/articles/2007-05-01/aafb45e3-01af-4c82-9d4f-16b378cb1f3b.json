Ancelotti, whose side are desperate to banish the memory of their defeat by Liverpool in Istanbul two years ago, said he regards next Wednesday's opponents as technically the weakest of the Premiership's top three clubs. \"Of the three English [Champions League semi-finalists] I would have preferred Manchester [United] in the final,\" he said. \"Partly because we got a view of them in the semi-final both at Old Trafford and San Siro and partly because they [United] are a technical squad who play and let you play. I don't get the feeling that will be the case with Liverpool.\" Ancelotti regards Liverpool's defensive strength and organisation as unusual for an English team and is not expecting a match as open as the 2005 final, which his side lost on penalties after a 3-3 draw. \"Two years ago Milan was suffering from fatigue and now all the players are in great shape,\" he said. \"Liverpool are very organised and have an extraordinary capacity for concentration. Milan is a strong Italian team; even if it has foreigners it has a strong Italian culture. Liverpool does not have the DNA of the English - it is more a Mediterranean kind of team.\" Ancelotti is boosted by the likely availability of his captain, Paolo Maldini. \"I think he can play because he is doing specific training for his knee,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
