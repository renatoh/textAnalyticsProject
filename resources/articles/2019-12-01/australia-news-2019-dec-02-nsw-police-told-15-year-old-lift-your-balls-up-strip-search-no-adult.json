On Monday the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission (LECC) began public hearings into the strip-search of \u201cseveral young people\u201d at the Lost City Music festival, an under-18s event held in Sydney in February. The inquiry is investigating the strip-searches of three boys aged 15, 16 and 17 at the festival, none of which found any illegal drugs, as well as the \u201cgeneral question\u201d of how police exercise their strip-search powers in New South Wales. On its opening morning the counsel assisting the commission, Peggy Dwyer, told the hearing at least 30 strip-searches were conducted on minors at the festival. In NSW, officers must not conduct a strip-search outside a police station unless the urgency and seriousness of the situation requires it. In the case of minors, a parent or guardian must be present unless an immediate search is necessary to protect the person or prevent the destruction of evidence. But the inquiry heard only five of the 30 searches were conducted in the presence of a support person. In one case, the support person provided to a 13-year-old girl was herself a minor; a 17-year-old girl from the Red Frog charity. Dwyer read from statements given to the commission by all three boys, which included one by a 17-year-old who told investigators an officer had \u201cran his hands around his buttocks\u201d during a search. The use of strip search powers has been the focus of increasing scrutiny in NSW in recent months. Last month the state opposition called for a review of the legislation underpinning their use after Guardian Australia revealed police had strip-searched 122 girls, including two 12-year-olds in the past three years. On Monday a senior police officer who had worked on at least 20 music festivals said he believed the legislation was too vague on the question of what constituted serious and urgent circumstances. \u201cWhy are we even speaking about ambiguity with the legislation? It shouldn\u2019t even be there,\u201d the officer said. \u201cIt should be spelt out what seriousness and urgency is, because I\u2019m sure everyone in this room would have a different opinion.\u201d The inquiry also heard evidence that two State Emergency Services volunteers had been organised to act as independent adults for children being strip-searched at the festival. When the LECC\u2019s chief commissioner Michael Adams, QC, questioned why they were suitable a senior officer at the event said they were members of a \u201cvery reputable organisation\u201d. Adams replied: \u201cYes, but it\u2019s not part of their ordinary duties to watch naked young people be searched by police.\u201d The 15-year-old told investigators he was \u201cso nervous he was shaking\u201d during the strip-search. \u201cI mean, it was just \u2026 they all sort of like look at you and when there\u2019s like 20 faces they all turn to you in that blue uniform. Like I felt like I just done something wrong but like, I\u2019m just trying to go to a music festival,\u201d he said. Dwyer told the inquiry the 15-year-old was stopped after an indication from a drug dog. During the search, which was conducted without a parent or support person, he was told to lift his shirt and show his armpits before being asked to \u201cpull his pants down\u201d. \u201cAnd the officer told him, quote, to \u2018hold your dick and lift your balls up and show me your gooch\u2019,\u201d Dwyer told the inquiry. A gooch is a slang term for the space between the testicles and anus. Dwyer said the young person lifted his testicles and the officer \u201cbent down to have a look, approximately one metre away from him\u201d. \u201cI sort of froze for a bit I guess, like, cause \u2026 I had my shirt up and then he\u2019s like, all right now like pull your pants down,\u201d the 15-year-old said. \u201cAnd I was sort of like, just stood there for a bit like, are you sure? Like, do I just pull down my pants and show you everything or like what? And he\u2019s like, no pull down your pants, hold your dick and lift your balls up and show me your gooch. And I was like \u2018OK\u2019.\u201d The inquiry heard that another 16-year-old boy, who was searched alone after he was found hiding a bum bag without any drugs inside, was told to \u201clift up his balls\u201d and to \u201csquat and cough\u201d during the search. During the search he asked police \u201cwhy is this happening\u201d. During a third search, a 17-year-old was told to \u201cgrab his penis and to lift it up\u201d before a male officer allegedly \u201cinserted his hands inside\u201d his underwear, \u201cand made contact with his testicles\u201d. \u201cIt was just like checking in the undie bit. Like they were, like his hand was, like it was touching \u2019em and then he\u2019s like ... moved to see if there\u2019s like anything in the undies,\u201d the 17-year-old said in a statement to the commission\u2019s investigators. Dwyer told the inquiry it was further alleged that after touching the 17-year-old the officer \u201cmoved around behind\u201d him, \u201cplaced both hands inside [his] shorts and ran his hands around his buttocks, in a circular motion, apparently in an effort to detect if drugs were concealed there\u201d. \u201cThe officer\u2019s hands made contact on the young person\u2019s skin,\u201d Dwyer told the hearing. The hearings form part of an investigation by the watchdog into the practice of strip-searching minors, amid increasing scrutiny of the possible misuse of the controversial police power. Dwyer told the commission a strip search was \u201cby necessity a grave intrusion of a citizen\u2019s privacy and dignity\u201d. \u201cAbsent any legal justification it would constitute an assault punishable by imprisonment,\u201d she said. \u201cLittle imagination is needed to understand how stressful and potentially embarrassing a strip search may be, even for law-abiding adults. Even more so for young people with little experience of law enforcement in this context and limited understanding of their rights.\u201d Earlier public hearings in October revealed the allegedly illegal strip-search of a 16-year-old girl at the 2018 Splendour in the Grass festival. The LECC\u2019s commissioner, Michael Adams QC, told the hearing it would also look at the \u201cgeneral question\u201d of how police were exercising their strip-search powers in NSW. \u201cIt is very likely the particular examples which the commission has identified are but examples of much wider conduct which requires attention,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
