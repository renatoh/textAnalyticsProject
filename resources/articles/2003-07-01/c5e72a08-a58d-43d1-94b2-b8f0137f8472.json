Which is very good news, because that saves me from watching Hollyoaks. Join us on Thursday for coverage of the second Test from Lord's. Bob Hope RIP. 6.20pm: Friends update: Phoebe long-lost brother has just grabbed one of Phoebe's work mates. \"He touched my fanny!\" she exclaims. You can tell this is an early series, before they'd really thought through the consequences of syndication. Greg Hensman writes: \"As much as you can bitch and moan mate, YOU'RE WATCHING FRIENDS! I'm trying to do WORK so I can go home.\" Fair point, well made. I'd be happier if BBC2 was showing The Simpsons. 6.10pm: Friends update: Joey has just dug a divet out of Monica's bathroom floor and covered it with a toilet brush. It was worth every second of the canned laughter. Can I go home yet? Alexi Sale has sold out. He does the voiceover on the new Dairylea ad. 6pm: Friends update: Channel 4 have done the sensible thing, turning off the life support machine keeping the first Test alive, and switching to re-runs of Friends. They're sitting in Central Perk, discussing which celebs they'd like to sleep with, all with the kind of smug expressions on their faces that say, \"and everyone of you in the studio audience wants to sleep with us!\" 5.50pm update: Three out of five lights are on the light meter. I can see about three people left at Edgbaston. Which must be about triple my readership at this time of day. Time, gentleman, please! England require another 211 runs with 9 wickets remaining and no Hope remaining. To save yourself from cutting your wrists, why not read today's Fiver and then subscribe to it. Like The Spin, it's free and it's funny. Dullness (as in light rather than style of cricket) stops play: And to be honest, like Bob Hope's death, it's a blessed release. On the subject of the 1991 European Cup final, David Smith says: \"I'm glad someone else remembers that european cup final, I was quite young and rooting for Marseille mainly because I preferred their strip, but I still found it the single greatest injustice I had ever witnessed...until several days later when that honour was bestowed on my school report.\" \"Can you tell Mr Martin so-called Sinclair that it was you, and not I, who mis-quoted The Happy Mondays please?\" asks Richard Sumner. No, Richard. It's funnier if people think it was your mistake. What? Oh. 34th over: England (chasing 321) 110-1 (Trescothick 52, Hussain 23) In the gathering gloom, Hussain smacks Peterson to the extra cover rope. Then the umpire offers him the light, which he gratefully accepts, to the sound of a forlorn foghorn in the background. 33rd over: England (chasing 321) 105-1 (Trescothick 51, Hussain 19) Another blinking maiden. Ye gads! This is about as entertaining as a Bob Hope comic turn. Speaking of which... \"At 82, Bob Hope is as funny as he ever was. I just never thought he was that funny in the first place.\" Thanks to Ashley Williams for digging out that nugget from Chevy Chase. 32nd over: England (chasing 321) 105-1 (Trescothick 51, Hussain 19) Continuing his schoolboy theme, Hussain flirts with a Peterson peach and attempts to pull, but the teaser carefully evades his attentions and almost kisses off stump instead. Next ball goes for an analogy-free single to third man. \"Wasn't Charlie Chaplin born in Hanwell, West London in about eighteen-ninety-something (give or take)?\" asks Carol the cake-sender. 31st over: England (chasing 321) 104-1 (Trescothick 51, Hussain 18) A maiden. Like Red Star Belgrade in the 1991 European Cup final, England are most definitely playing for a draw now. Trescothick almost goes when he edges to Pollock at first slip. But like a heartless vet, Pollock needlessly put it down! 30th over: England (chasing 321) 104-1 (Trescothick 51, Hussain 18) Nasser Hussain plays and misses like an inexperienced teenager at a school disco, but eventually a lunge pays off and he scores. Four runs to the cover boundary. \"Richard Sumner has got it wrong,\" writes Martin Sinclair. \"Obviously, he feels his surname grants him license to misquote Factory Records records. Shaun Ryder actually says 'you're twisting my melon, man'. While he did get chubby, he never quite developed man-melons. The melon he is refering to is his bonce, which I'm sure was pretty permanently twisted by the industrial quantities of narcotics he spiked himself with.\" 29th over: England (chasing 321) 100-1 (Trescothick 51, Hussain 14) Dot. Dot. Dot. Dot. Dot. Dot. N Bowen can read obituaries too! \"Bob Hope was the son of a stonemason and a former concert singer,\" he says. He had a career as an entertainer carved out for him, then. (B'dum-tsh!) \"Leslie Hope (born Eltham 1903) changed his name from Leslie to Bob, because in school they would call the roll as 'Hope, Leslie' and classmates shortened it to hopeless. I think you'll agree, utterly fascinating.\" That's the stuff, Piers Canadas. Play due to restart at 5.05pm There's enough canvas on the pitch to make Lisa Riley a bikini. But now it's coming off (much like Lisa's bikini in your collective mind's eye, oh yes). It'll take a while to get rid of it all, obviously, but when they do, play will resume. And then England can get on with winning this match. Tom Price quotes Bob Hope: \"If you watch a game, it's fun. If you play it, it's recreation. If you work at it, it's golf.\" If you avoid work at all costs, it's Guardian over-by-over cricket coverage. \"Should I touch Bob with my cursor or my finger?\" asks Jeff Stringer. I recommend your Bakewell Pudding. But be careful - too much Bakewell Pudding will kill you. Play delayed: No sooner have the umpires taken the players off due to bad light, than the heavens open. The covers are on and umbrellas are up. Keep it here for drop-by-drop coverage. It can't be any less entertaining than the day's cricket. \"Thanks a bundle!\" exclaims Richard Rouse. \"I touched my screen and got a static shock. I hope it was worth it. If we don't get the runs now I will take reprisals against you, Nasser and Bob Hope. This will take the form of reading coverage from a different website, campaigning tirelessly for Vaughan to be made captain and going home and playing 'Dancing on your Grave' by Motorhead.\" Richard Sumner says I am twisting his melons, man. \"Cary Grant, whose real name was Archibald Leach, was born on Monday 18th of January 1904 at 15 Hughenden Road, Horfield, a northern suburb of Bristol,\" says Airchie. \"That picture of Bob Hope looks a bit like Major Charles Ingram, the dodgy army millionaire cheat. Anyone else see it?\" asks Andrew Miller. Both have given top entertainment in their time. 28th over: England (chasing 321) 100-1 (Trescothick 51, Hussain 14) Trescothick plays a single to third man to bring up the 100 for England. The skies are darkening overhead. Stephen Walkley wishes to take issue with those people who claim Stan Laurel was born in Cumbria. \"When Stan was born in Ulverston - Ulverston was in the Furness district of Lancashire,\" he points out. It's a good job that some people are paying attention. The rest of you: think on! 27th over: England (chasing 321) 99-1 (Trescothick 50, Hussain 14) The umpires get their instruments out. Then they look at their light meters. Play continues. My appalling gags do not. An unplayable delivery from Pretorius kicks up at Hussain and flies over Boucher's head to the fence: four byes. \"I have never met or seen Bob Hope,\" says Anton Lawrence. \"My middle name is Bob though, so there is in fact a great bond between us. We were both born in the UK too.\" 26th over: England (chasing 321) 95-1 (Trescothick 50, Hussain 14) Gah! A maiden from Peterson. You're not touching Bob enough! Nicholas Parsons' boss is the spitting image of that Hawtry chap of Carry On fame. In case you're interested. 25th over: England (chasing 321) 95-1 (Trescothick 50, Hussain 14) That perhaps looked riskier than it was from Hussain. It went in the air but found a gap and raced to the point fence to bring up the only four runs of the over. England need at least five off each. Touch Bob on your screens and will England to victory! 24th over: England (chasing 321) 91-1 (Trescothick 50, Hussain 10) Trescothick and his broken finger guide Peterson to third man to bring up the man's 50. \"My mum is always trying to have me believe that Robbie Williams is Stan Laurel's grandson - can anyone tell me if this rumour is true?\" says Kate Hawkins. 23rd over: England (chasing 321) 89-1 (Trescothick 49, Hussain 9) Pretorius comes in for some rough treatment from the England captain, who, joy of all joys, beats his first innings score of one. Successive boundaries take him to 9. Four legbyes to boot. \"If any England pairing is going to do it, it'll be Tresco and Freddie,\" says Richard Kendall. \"Of course, it does require that Pollock falls over and gets injured straight after tea, but that's a mere formality obviously, then we can biff and bang our way to victory with nine balls to spare.\" I'm with you, Richard. We can still do this, right? Right? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller? Bueller? 22nd over: England (chasing 321) 77-1 (Trescothick 49, Hussain 1) Five runs and the handy wicket of Michael Vaughan off Peterson's cucumber-sandwiches-interrupted over. Nas gets a streaky single off the first ball after tea, just edging past Pollock in the slips. Trescothick edges towards that half-ton with a thunderous cover drive. \"Bob Hope was born in Eltham, SE London. Stan Laurel was born in Ulverston, Cumbria.\" Ben Harris studies birth certificates in his spare time. Preamble: We've got 44 overs of cricket left today, but the light's not too good. England are 72 for one, chasing a target of 321. It might as well be 1,321 for all the hope they have of hitting it. If you read Nick Harper's after session, you'll know that Bob Hope carked it earlier today. In a tribute to the great man, send in your Bob Hope facts or anecdotes, no detail to trivial.
