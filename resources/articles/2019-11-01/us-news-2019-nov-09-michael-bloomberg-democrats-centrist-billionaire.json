The presidency. But as Michael Bloomberg prepares to jump into the race for the Democratic nomination at a time when the party is energized by progressive politics, the shake-up he intends to perform on a fitful and crowded field may never come to pass. The three-time New York mayor does not lack in attractive attributes, including pragmatic takes on climate change and gun control. But Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson did not set the political passions racing with his reasoning for his paymaster\u2019s decision to start the process of registering in early voting states, beginning with Alabama on Friday. \u201cMike believes Donald Trump represents an unprecedented threat to our nation,\u201d Wolfson said. \u201cMike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that.\u201d In short, the billionaire believes moderates in the Democratic party are suffering due to Joe Biden\u2019s flagging campaign, and Biden\u2019s fall could open the door to leftwing senators Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders who, Bloomberg fears, will position the party too far left to unseat Trump. Serious questions hang over any Bloomberg run. One school of thought reasons it may even boost the left wing he is seeking to trample. With 2020 likely to turn on female voters \u2013 51% of whom voted Trump in 2015 \u2013 one of many questions overhanging a Bloomberg candidacy is whether he can win women over. He is also unlikely to be endorsed by any progressives \u2013 he has already crossed swords with firebrand New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over her campaign against Amazon situating a new HQ in New York and over the Green New Deal environmental policy. At a time when Trump has been widely condemned by Democrats for his long record of insulting women and admission of sexual assault with his \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d comment, Bloomberg faces his own problems. In 2008, his namesake financial-services and media company company was accused by at least 54 women of discrimination and sexual harassment \u2013 claims from a period after he left an active role in the company. He himself was not named in the suits. Still, if Biden\u2019s problem is money \u2013 at the last financial election filing he had just $9m on hand and was spending more than he was raising \u2013 Bloomberg would not have that issue. Recent surveys place his fortune at $51bn. When the former mayor\u2019s name last came up as a candidate, in February, top adviser Kevin Sheekey did not blanch at the calculation that Bloomberg would need to spend at least $500m to run a campaign. \u201cThat\u2019ll get us through the first few months,\u201d Sheekey told Politico. \u2018Another white billionaire\u2019 Bloomberg\u2019s name recognition may not be what he thinks it is, warned Alynna Lyon, a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire. \u201cHis name may have resonance in the east,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not sure he is recognised in the south or the west and that could be a challenging area.\u201d In a 2016 poll that tested Bloomberg\u2019s name recognition, about a third of voters said they had a neutral view of him and about a quarter said they were unsure of their impression or didn\u2019t know his name. In the same poll, 27% said they had a negative view and just 16% of voters said they had a positive impression. Timothy Hegle, a political professor at the University of Iowa, said Bloomberg\u2019s candidacy could have the opposite effect of what he intends. \u201cIf he enters, [it] could end up splitting votes for Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar \u2013 candidates trying to occupy the centre lane \u2013 and that ends up helping Sanders and Warren, and that seems to be contrary to his expectation.\u201d With less than 100 days to go before the Iowa caucuses, Democrats do not express dissatisfaction with their available candidates. Some 85% of the party\u2019s primary voters said they were satisfied with the candidates, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found late last month. Just 13% said they were unsatisfied. That indicates that nerves over stuttering centrist candidates reflect a nervousness among the political elite, not actual party supporters. Moreover the field is not lacking a wealthy white man. Voters have that in Tom Steyer, a San Francisco billionaire who has been running a well-financed campaign to little discernible effect. \u201cSteyer may have ruined it for Bloomberg, to a certain extent,\u201d said Hegle. \u201cAnother white billionaire trying to buy the nomination is not going to change the race too much, and is not going to be well-received among activist Democrats. At best he\u2019s going to split the centrist vote.\u201d For the time being, such arguments are academic. Bloomberg has not yet formally declared a run. He could still easily decide against the idea. Twice before, he has deferred to existing candidates for fear of splitting the vote. What\u2019s different this time? Age, perhaps? At 77, he cannot plausibly wait another four years. The prospect of a Bloomberg run does not seem to trouble Trump, who pitched in with a characteristically mean-spirited comment, telling reporters: \u201cThere is nobody I\u2019d rather run against than little Michael.\u201d Much has yet to be determined but Hegle said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see his path to the nomination. He might potentially disrupt the race, and even then it\u2019s hard to see how much disruption he can really create without an existing base of supporters.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
