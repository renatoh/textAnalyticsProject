Dodson was widely expected to be the nation\u2019s first Indigenous cabinet minister if Labor won government but that title went to Noongar man Ken Wyatt who was sworn in as the Liberal National party\u2019s minister for Indigenous Australians late last week. Dodson said Labor\u2019s defeat was \u201ca sad blow, there\u2019s no doubt about that\u201d. \u201cTo watch the election results come in, and to know we wouldn\u2019t be in charge of the agenda going forward, particularly in terms of Indigenous affairs, that was the most difficult part of it for me.\u201d Dodson said his views about a voice to parliament entrenched in the constitution, and a Makarrata commission to talk about truth and treaty-making, haven\u2019t changed. \u201cIt\u2019s time we stopped procrastinating over what is seen by first nations peoples as critical to the building of a new relationship, and having a say over the issues that affect them,\u201d he said. Dodson called for a bipartisan approach to advance the demands of the Uluru statement from the heart. \u201cI really do think we\u2019ve got to put pressure on the government to get this matter done in the first term and work with Ken to achieve it, because if he can\u2019t get it past the six or seven people on his frontbench, then the whole nation\u2019s being held up because of their attitudes.\u201d \u201cI think the Australian public are almost tired of this discussion and want to get on with it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I know that many first nations people just want to get on with it.\u201d Labor\u2019s decision to divide the job of Indigenous affairs in two \u2013 between program delivery and the big picture issues of constitutional reform and a voice to parliament \u2013 is a \u201cvery powerful thing to do\u201d, according to the ALP\u2019s new spokesperson on Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney. \u201cThe thinking around it was that quite often one person trying to do nation-building on top of social justice issues becomes too big,\u201d Burney said. \u201cThe issues around the Uluru statement are a very high priority.\u201d Burney will take the lead on Closing the Gap targets like health, housing and education, while the high rate of suicide in Indigenous communities requires particular focus. \u201cThe government has to go beyond, to solutions. It\u2019s all very well to wring your hands and say it\u2019s terrible but unless you\u2019re willing to invest in early intervention, prevention and servicing families, then you\u2019re not going to really change very much,\u201d she said. \u201cThe answers are out there, if we are about to talk to the right people, and listen to the right people, and trust the Aboriginal community-based organisations who are good deliverers of these programs,\u201d she said. Burney agreed there is hope for collaboration on Indigenous affairs with Wyatt as minister, \u201cbut I don\u2019t like the idea that to try and reach bipartisanship it should be a race to the bottom. Bipartisanship should be about the best outcome, not just distilling to where you can agree with things.\u201d Wyatt said last week he intends to take \u201cpragmatic action\u201d. \u201cOur government\u2019s priorities for Indigenous Australians are to see our children attend school and achieve the best education possible, to ensure our people \u2013 particularly the young \u2013 do not take their own lives, and to work together to establish and expand real jobs and opportunities for Indigenous Australian,\u201d Wyatt said in a statement. Wyatt said more work needed to be done on the model for a voice to parliament to put to a referendum, \u201cwhich is why we have committed $7.3m for the comprehensive co-design of models to improve local and regional decision-making and options for constitutional recognition.\u201d Wyatt said that the work would \u201ccommence immediately\u201d but would not set a timeframe for the delivery of a model or pathway to a \u201csuccessful\u201d referendum. Dodson said the pragmatic approach was not enough. \u201cWe\u2019ve had years of practical reconciliation, and there have been failures of closing the gap every year,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to wait until the social justice factors have all been resolved, we\u2019re never going to get to these systemic and seminal issues. \u201cBoth can be done, and I would hope that if we really reflect on the Uluru statement, that\u2019s what people have asked for. They\u2019re not big things to ask.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
