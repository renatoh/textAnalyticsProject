This multimedia journal of one man's suicidal impulse is either a dark masterpiece that yields coruscating insights into the depressive mind (Noble has a history of mental illness), or it's a wallow in squalor and self-pity, the staging of which marks its sensation-seeking nadir. Maybe it's both. It's certainly unforgettable. The show chronicles Noble's journey through manic depression in home-made videos, recorded phone calls and contributions from his mum (\"Kim is a fucking loser\"). We see footage of him masturbating, self-harming and being pissed on in the street. A Plasticine Kim blows his own brains out. We are encouraged to text his ex-girlfriend with vengeful messages. On stage, Noble MC's like a man mired in despair: eyes downcast, voice quavering. How real is this account of his misery? The show's construction \u2013 its skilful refusal to let the audience settle, its interplay between live and recorded action \u2013 implies artifice. But emotionally, it's excruciatingly raw. The self-absorption isn't total. Seeking to redeem himself by good deeds, Noble removes products from shops, \"improves\" them and returns them to their shelves; his choice of merchandise (Paul McKenna's self-help books, Floella Benjamin's ready meals) reveals a fierce critique of consumerism and celebrity culture. Elsewhere, satire cedes entirely to candour, as Noble strips away everything, save his pain and misanthropy. I admire his bravery in being so honest, but was often appalled at what the honesty revealed. I left feeling sad for Noble, and excited by the challenges he poses. Do we look, or turn away? Where does art stop and life begin? And however did entertainment come to this?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
