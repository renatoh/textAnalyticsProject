The foundations are expected to wind down the level of grants and awards in the wake of the downturn. Fifty-five per cent of the 142 foundations in the study, to be published in the Chronicle of Philanthropy this week, said they expected their giving to stay static or drop this year. A similar percentage said their assets had shrunk in the past 12 months. The Chronicle says: \"Large grants and new long-term awards could be the first to be jettisoned as foundations adjust their spending to slower growth or losses in asset values.\" This is seen as a worrying sign for the US charitable sector as foundations are usually considered a bedrock of support in times of economic downturn because of their steady asset base. However, some high profile foundations have themselves lost income in the fallout from dot.com failures. The assets of the David and Lucile Packard Foundation dropped by 25% last year - most of its investments were in Hewlett-Packard, the business and home computer hardware company, and its subsidiary, technology firm Agilent. The Paul G Allen Foundation - set up by billionaire Microsoft founder Paul Allen - also saw its assets drop by 39%. The overall decline of the biggest foundations' assets was 0.3% but this figure is skewed by the success of the two largest foundations, William H Gates and the Lilly Endowment. The William H Gates Foundation set up by chairman of Microsoft, Bill Gates, donated $34m in cash and $200m in software last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
