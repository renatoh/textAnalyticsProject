Those present could hear the familiar sound of a half-joke being cracked \u2013 because one thing Sir Alan's job has not been is boring. No, it has been a slow-burning scandal \u2013 one that shows up the flaws in the government's flagship economic-policy creation. A quick recap: when George Osborne came up with the idea of the new Office for Budget Responsibility, he chose Sir Alan to be its head. It was a cunning move: the youthful then-shadow chancellor now had a grey-bearded economist on his team, and an institution that would do for tax-and-spend policy what Gordon Brown did for interest-rate policy. Just as Mr Brown set the Bank of England free in 1997 to determine borrowing costs independently of meddlesome chancellors, so Mr Osborne could now claim that he would create an independent, transparent and credible budget watchdog. On all three counts, the OBR has failed, and failed miserably. That much was confirmed again in yesterday's Treasury select committee. If Sir Alan was so independent, why did he allow himself to be used as window-dressing by the Tory party even before it took office? If it was so transparent, then why did no one (apart from those close to Sir Alan, apparently) know that its head would leave within a few weeks, or that its forecasts for job losses in the public sector were based on one set of assumptions one week, and on a completely different set the week after? And no one who saw the new, supposedly apolitical, organisation rush forward its prediction for job losses to coincide with prime minister's questions could deny that its credibility has taken a very big hit. To his credit, Sir Alan did not deny any of these charges. The 73-year-old former academic accepted too that he had been naive. That description is true in more than one sense, because Sir Alan has really been used as the fall guy by the new chancellor, who has too often in the past couple of months conducted economic policy by press release \u2013 rushing forward badly thought-out initiatives for the sake of short-term political gain. Amid a deep slump and bloody fiscal austerity, the OBR was always going to be a controversial body. But by making it virtually a Treasury operation \u2013 based in the Treasury, largely staffed by people on loan from the Treasury and without sufficient independence of thought \u2013 Mr Osborne has effectively dealt his own baby a mortal blow. In a bid to de-politicise what is naturally a political area (the setting and monitoring of government budgets, no less), the chancellor has failed \u2013 thanks to his willingness to cock a snook at the old brigade. A very worrying precedent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
