Nielsen scored the first and won the penalty from which Iwan Roberts added the second in a 2-1 win which the visiting Dons ended with nine men. \"I'm enjoying my time here and I want to stay,\" said Nielsen. \"I most certainly can't go back to Wimbledon after today.\" At the bottom of the table Stockport slumped to a sixth successive defeat, losing 2-0 to a Portsmouth side who ended their own miserable run of three losses. \"No disrespect to Portsmouth but I don't think they are anything out of the ordinary,\" said Carlton Palmer. \"You can prepare all you want but if your players don't perform then you won't win. I'm very disappointed.\" Bristol City moved closer to the top of the Second Division after a fifth successive league victory. Given their form they could have expected to dispose of struggling Wrexham with some ease, but it took a Brian Carey own goal 10 minutes from time to secure the points. Cambridge remain bottom after Wycombe inflicted a fifth successive defeat thanks to first-half goals from Keith Ryan and Jermaine McSporran. The only glimmer of hope for the visitors came after 52 minutes when a floodlight failure offered temporary hope of an abandonment. Scunthorpe ended Plymouth 's 19-match unbeaten run in the Third Division with a 2-1 win at Glanford Park, though the Pilgrims remain five points clear after Luton were held by Hartlepool at Kenilworth Road."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
