You can't leave until after work on Friday and you need to be back at work on Monday morning. Are there any cheap fares left, and is it worth flying? Timings - with departures close to 5pm on Friday and 4pm on Sunday - were the most important criteria in this survey. Leaving a few hours later or earlier can make flying cheaper than going by train. For once, the big comparison sites - Opodo, Expedia and Travelocity - did a poor job of finding the cheapest airfares. Gobycoach Gobycoach \u00a337 If you can face it, the cheapest way of getting to Edinburgh is by National Express. What's more, you'll save on the first night's accommodation, because the 22.30 departure from Victoria coach station arrives just in time for breakfast the following morning. Leave Edinburgh at 22.00 on Sunday and get back at 06.45, beating the rush hour into work. Another 30% off is available for students, senior citizens and under-26s with a Coachcard; this costs \u00a39 for a year. Qjump Qjump \u00a382.80 Now that Totaljourney.com has gone the way of its backer, Railtrack, there are two rail ticket sites to choose from. Both have their idiosyncrasies; on Qjump, some of the fare information doesn't display properly on certain types of browser, so choosing the cheapest fare is a hit-and-miss affair. Trainline Trainline \u00a382.80 Again, this site has its failings. Tell it to search for the cheapest rather than the fastest fare and Trainline will suggest leaving on Saturday morning. But the various ticket prices are displayed slightly more clearly, and if you're feeling flush, the first class fares are shown too. Go Go \u00a3161.30 Simple, rapid, intelligent. Let's hope any merger between easyJet and Go doesn't lead to a big rise in fares to Edinburgh. easyJet easyJet From Luton \u00a3225 From Gatwick \u00a3245 Watch out for easyJet's additional charges, which now include tax, an insurance and security charge (also levied by Go), and a \"Barclays fat cat charge\" for passengers flying from Luton. British Airways British Airways \u00a3233.40 BA's previously erratic site has improved a great deal lately, and enables you to see the cheapest times to fly. bmi bmi \u00a3273.60 Once I'd chosen the fare, bmi knocked \u00a320 off the price - making this the first time a site has haggled with me. Impressive, but still rather expensive. British European British European \u00a3290.80 ScotAirways ScotAirways \u00a3319.75 The only flights available were in business class, but the flights are frequent and cost-coded - and who else will fly you up to Scotland in a 31-seater Fairchild Dornier 328? ros.taylor@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
