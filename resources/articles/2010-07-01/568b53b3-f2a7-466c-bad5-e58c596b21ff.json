All those cars, all that air conditioning and not a little crude oil. And thus no surprise that, sighting officials from the kingdom at a United Nations climate meeting in Bonn last month, activists would want to show their displeasure. But come on, guys, there are ways and ways of addressing these things, and quite the wrong way was to snaffle the desk sign bearing the words Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, break it into pieces, stuff them down the toilet and then circulate pictures of the end product. It didn't help the planet, and it didn't help them. For yesterday we learned that one Oxfam employee implicated in it all has been suspended, as has a colleague working for the environmental non-governmental organisation WWF. Another of the miscreants who also worked for WWF no longer does so. And it doesn't end there, for both organisations have requested agenda space at the next UN meeting to wring their hands and formally apologise. Still, it seemed a good idea at the time. \u2022 Just two months ago, we wrote: \"The best thing about having so many Conservatives in government is that it may deter them from lending their names to questionable enterprises. They have red boxes to read now and civil servants to intervene when they talk rubbish. Thus one wonders how much time they may have for initiatives like the Atlantic Bridge.\" And right we were too, for we see that the dodgy set-up launched in 1997 by Liam Fox to \"strengthen the special relationship\", with Margaret Thatcher as patron and advisory council members such as Michael Gove, George Osborne and William Hague, now has a few problems with the Charity Commission. Too nakedly party political to be an educational charity, the watchdog says. A great result for blogger Stephen Newton, who long ago raised a flag to indicate that something wasn't right. He says the breach of charity law was so obvious that the whole shebang should have been routed by the taxman. But still, the Atlantic Bridge has now been given 12 months to reconstitute itself. On this side of the pond, at least, operations appear to have wound down, the website lies dormant. One can always quibble but it seems like a job well done. \u2022 That said, it might seem strange that the Charity Commission has held off giving the Atlantic Bridge the sort of drubbing it handed out to the Labour-leaning Smith Institute when that body faced similar allegations in 2008. The Smith Institute had just six months to get its house in order and has since ceased to be a charity. Why the kid gloves? Hopefully nothing to do with the Tory bonfire of the quangos? \u2022 And as Nick Griffin rages on about being banned from the Queen's garden party, attention inevitably turns to Charles's plans to meet the people. A garden party at Clarence House in September sounds just the ticket. He's been sprucing the place up, with tree surgeons popping in, and sprinklers on even when it's raining. But surely the highlight will be the decision by the prince to allow the public to get their hands on his precious curtains. He will, said a spokesman, \"make his disused curtains available, for 'recycling' by the public, into Morsbags\" \u2013 shopping bags made from recycled material. It's jolly good for the environment, the sort of thing he might have discussed at a recent meeting with environment secretary Caroline Spelman. As for the resale value of old curtains: who needs it? Charles earned a record \u00a317m from the Duchy of Cornwall estate last year. \u2022 And finally, with the exciting announcement that chief constables will be placed under the supervision of newly recruited \"police commissioners\", the search is on to find suitable people. This should not prove to be an insurmountable problem. Ian Bone, founder of Class War and veteran anarchist troublemaker, has already announced his intention to contest such a post when they come up for grabs in 2012. He's learned quite a bit about policing over the years: how they control a hostile crowd, how they deploy riot gear. Just the sort Theresa May will have in mind. diary@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
