President Karzai was on an official trip to a school opening in Gardez, south of the capital, Kabul. A US military spokesman, Major Mark McCann, said one rocket was fired as the helicopter was landing, hitting the ground 300m away. \"The president did not appear to be in any danger,\" he said. The presidential security team, which includes an army of American private security consultants flanking the president everywhere he goes, quickly aborted the landing and rushed Mr Karzai back to Kabul. Mr Karzai's spokesman, Khaleeq Ahmed, said the president had felt that the move was an over-reaction and was \"very disappointed\" not to be able to visit the school as planned. President Karzai has rarely been seen outside the presidential palace since an assassination attempt two years ago in Kandahar. But during the current presidential campaign, he has been attending more official events, in an attempt to heighten his public profile before the October 9 election."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
