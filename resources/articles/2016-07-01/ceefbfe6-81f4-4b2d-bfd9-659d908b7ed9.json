It started scrappily, with a handful of disendorsements and minor gaffes from low-profile candidates. But it heated up quickly, with federal police raids of Labor offices. It then turned nasty, with the Coalition and Labor ramping up scare campaigns to inflict as much damage as possible on their opponents. Here were some of the key moments. What a joy. 8 May: The campaign starts on Sunday 8 May, when Malcolm Turnbull visits the governor general\u2019s residence to ask for a double dissolution election on 2 July. 11 May: Within three days, Labor says it will disendorse its candidate for Fremantle in WA, unionist Chris Brown, after it was revealed he had failed to disclose criminal convictions from the 1980s. 16 May: Five days later, the Liberal party\u2019s own candidate for Fremantle, Sherry Sufi, was thrust into the national spotlight after it was revealed he\u2019d incorrectly described his work experience on his application for endorsement by the Liberal party. He was noticeably absent from a press conference that morning with Malcolm Turnbull who had made a flying visit to Perth. He resigned as a candidate a week later. 17 May: The next day, Labor frontbencher and member for Batman in Victoria, David Feeney, was revealed to have an undeclared $2.3m property. He also said he didn\u2019t know if the property was negatively geared, but he later admitted it was. NBN raids \u2013 19 May: The federal police execute two search warrants in Melbourne over allegations of unauthorised leaking of confidential national broadband network documents. One office raided belongs to Labor\u2019s communications spokesman, Stephen Conroy. The \u201cspend-o-meter\u201d \u2013 20 May: Bill Shorten makes a throwaway comment at a town hall event in Woy Woy, NSW, about adding a million dollars to the \u201cspend-o-meter\u201d to pay for an intersection upgrade in the area. It was a reference to the daily \u201cspend-o-meter\u201d column in the Australian newspaper that has been tracking election commitments, but next morning the Coalition was using it to attack Shorten\u2019s attitude towards spending. They repeated the attack for the rest of the campaign. The \u201c$67bn budget black hole\u201d \u2013 24 May: The treasurer, Scott Morrison, and the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, make a brazen announcement, accusing Labor of having a $67bn budget \u201cblack hole.\u201d But they have to admit, almost immediately, that the black hole is \u201cat least $32bn and as much as $67bn.\u201d The press conference becomes a trainwreck. 25 May: Embattled Labor frontbencher David Feeney, still recovering from his negative-gearing debacle a week earlier, sits for an interview with Sky News, and it quickly unravels. He starts the interview by admitting that his failure to register his $2.3m property had been the biggest \u201cown goal\u201d of the election campaign. But then he trips up again, failing to have any idea about Labor\u2019s position on the $4.5bn schoolkids\u2019 bonus. \u201cThe \u2026 well \u2026 we \u2026 in terms \u2013 the baby bonus?\u201d he says. \u201cWell I \u2013 you\u2019d have to refer to our relevant shadow. I\u2019ve been a little \u2026 ah \u2026 distracted over the last few days.\u201d He then accidentally leaves behind in the studio a confidential document containing Labor \u201ctalking points\u201d. Labor staffers later tell journalists that he\u2019s been locked away for the rest of the campaign. 26 May: Spooked by the Coalition\u2019s accusations two days earlier of a $67bn black hole, Labor says it will drop its support for the schoolkids\u2019 bonus. It also says it will not reverse the government\u2019s changes to the pension assets test. The move shaves $8bn off Labor\u2019s spending commitments overnight. \u201cFlushed out\u201d \u2013 A few hours later, Morrison and Cormann hold a press conference declaring that their \u201c$67bn black hole\u201d accusation had worked because it had \u201cflushed out\u201d the truth from Labor. Morrison admits his claim of a $67bn black hole was merely a tactic. \u201cI said it was up to $67bn,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cI\u2019m not making an estimate now other than to say it\u2019s up to $67bn \u2026 our intent was very clear here and that was to flush out Labor from walking both sides of the street.\u201d 28 May: The NBN chairman, Ziggy Switkowski, writes an opinion piece, published in Fairfax Media, defending his decision to ask the federal police to investigate leaks of NBN documents. He makes no apologies for calling in the feds. Labor officially complains to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet that Switkowski\u2019s piece breaks the caretaker conventions. 28 May: The Liberal\u2019s candidate for the Victorian seat of McEwen, Chris Jermyn, tries to gatecrash one of Bill Shorten\u2019s campaign events in Melbourne but when reporters ask him about the details of the Coalition\u2019s health policies he fails to answer them. He then declares his hatred for journalists and retreats hastily. 29 May: The National Press Club holds the second leaders\u2019 debate. The Guardian\u2019s Mike Bowers takes a photo of a bored Laura Tingle from the Australian Financial Review. It sums up the nation\u2019s feelings. 8 June: Fairfax Media breaks the story that nearly all Liberal MPs pay a company, called Parakeelia Pty Ltd, $2,500 a year to use \u201cFeedback\u201d software, with money understood to come from their taxpayer-funded office allowances. The company also donated $500,000 to the federal Liberal division last financial year, making it the party\u2019s second-biggest single source of funds. Parakeelia is also controlled by Liberal party bosses. 9 June: Cabinet secretary Arthur Sinodinos tells Sky News he doesn\u2019t know if taxpayer funds have been paid to Parakeelia, which in turn transferred $500,000 to the Coalition. The Greens\u2019 lower house campaign suffers a major blow \u2013 12 June: The Liberal party strikes a deal with Labor to ensure it will get Labor preferences in three key rural seats so it can fend off threats from Nationals candidates. In return, the Liberal party says it will preference Labor ahead of the Greens in key inner-city seats. The deal is a huge blow to the Greens\u2019 lower house campaign, because the Greens were relying on getting Liberal preferences in inner-city Melbourne and Sydney seats to beat their Labor rivals. 13 June: A day after the Liberal-Labor preference deal is announced, the Greens say they will preference the Labor party ahead of the Liberal and National parties in 139 of the 150 electorates across the country, including in all marginal seats. They\u2019ll also preference Labor in every Senate seat. They say local branches in the remaining 11 lower house seats will issue open how-to-vote cards. 15 June: Fairfax reports that Ziggy Switkowski, the NBN chairman, wilfully breached caretaker conventions during the election campaign, against the direct advice of the nation\u2019s top public servant, by writing his opinion piece for Fairfax in which he made no apologies for calling in the federal police to raid Labor offices in May. 19 June: The Labor party\u2019s campaign launch. Shorten insists that Turnbull is trying to private Medicare by stealth, signalling Labor will double down on its Medicare scare campaign. Malcolm Turnbull later rubbishes the claim, promising Medicare will always stay in public hands. Turnbull ramps up Coalition claims that a Labor government would see people smugglers resume efforts to bring asylum seekers to Australia. Brexit \u2013 24 June: Britain votes to leave the European Union, sending shockwaves through political and economic circles. Within days, the Coalition starts warning voters that only the Coalition could provide stability in government. 26 June: Labor releases its budget costings, showing a deficit worth $16bn more than the Coalition\u2019s over the next four years. The Coalition seizes on the announcement, saying it proves Labor wants to tax and spend more and doesn\u2019t care about the deficit. It\u2019s a key moment in the campaign. The start of the last week \u2013 27 June: The Coalition shifts ahead of Labor in the latest Newspoll, for the first time in the campaign. The Coalition is reported to be ahead at 51% over Labor\u2019s 49% on a two-party preferred basis. Its primary vote rises to a 14-week high, up two points to 43%, while Labor\u2019s primary vote remains unchanged at 36%. 28 June: The Coalition promises to collect an extra $2bn over the next four years by cracking down on welfare and pension recipients. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, says the money it collects will be used to offset the extra $1.2bn in election spending it has announced over the past few weeks for things such as tennis courts, CCTV cameras and community grants \u2013 principally in Liberal and National electorates. In the final week, Turnbull\u2019s argument that a plebiscite on same-sex marriage will \u201csail through\u201d parliament looks increasingly disingenuous, as a growing number of ministers in his party say they will vote \u201cno\u201d in a free vote in parliament. 30 June: Turnbull\u2019s speech at the National Press Club, two days before the election. After a bitter eight-week campaign, he tries to consolidate his political position and remake the claim that he\u2019s a leader above partisan politics. He says he thinks voters want the parliament to \u201coffload the ideology, to end the juvenile theatrics and gotcha moments, to drop the personality politics.\u201d \u201cThey want our focus to be on issues that matter to them \u2013 and an end to division for division\u2019s sake,\u201d he says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
