I've got exams when I go back this week. I've been trying to do as much revision as possible, but I fell behind a bit. I made a timetable and I've been trying to catch up. I am nervous. They are my first university exams, but I don't mind exams too much. I prefer them to coursework, but I've got two courseworks to hand in, too! At least exams are over quite quickly. That's what I'm thinking about at the moment, them being over. I think they'll be fine, as long as I don't get too nervous. There are five exams - or is it four? They're mainly on the core units we did last term. I have been enjoying the course a lot. It's a mixture of the work and the social life that I like. I've been making uni friends, but I still have friends out of uni. I'm still living at home, so I can see my friends who went to other unis around London. I think it's probably easier to make friends at university if you're living in halls, but I don't mind. I meet lots of people all the time. I'm at uni every day anyway for lectures. They're not all interesting, but I try to stay awake. I eat something with lots of energy in it before I go in! I don't have a problem getting peace and quiet to study at home. My twin sister's at uni and my brother's away, so it's fine. My sister started uni a year before me because I was doing a foundation course last year. I tried to get a lot of information from her and my brother before I started, because I didn't know what to expect. I think we're going on a field trip for geology near Easter; I'm not sure where - somewhere cold, I think! It is quite hard work, but I expected it to be, so I don't mind. It's just a case of making sure you are keeping up with it all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
