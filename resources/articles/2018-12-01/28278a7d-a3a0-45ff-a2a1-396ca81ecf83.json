In a conversation with Guardian Australia\u2019s political podcast, Hanson-Young says talks are under way across the parties about a women\u2019s caucus after a year in which women in politics have spoken out against bullying and harassment, excesses in culture, poor levels of representation and gendered insults. \u201cI think we need [a women\u2019s parliamentary caucus], and those conversations have started to happen, finally,\u201d Hanson-Young said. She said she had spoken to Labor women about forming the group, and reached out to the Liberals who made public complaints about poor behaviour during the government\u2019s leadership implosion in August. Hanson-Young said women needed to stop scoring points by using deficiencies in party culture as a partisan weapon. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be played with,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we need to put down our bows and arrows politically and say women deserve a voice in this parliament, from all parties, from all sides of politics, because when we work together we do a really good job.\u201d She said a decade of parliamentary service had taught her that women made greater strides when they acted collaboratively. \u201cWe engage in a way with each other that\u2019s different, and the only way we change the culture is to get more women in politics. They are not going to come from one side, so we have to work together to make sure there are more women from all sides that are elected\u201d. Hanson-Young, who took on the Liberal Democratic party senator David Leyonhjelm this year, was at the centre of another incident in the Senate this week where the Queensland LNP senator Barry O\u2019Sullivan said she had \u201ca bit of Nick Xenophon in her\u201d \u2013 an aside that generated an uproar. Greens leader Richard Di Natale called O\u2019Sullivan a \u201cpig\u201d and was ejected from the chamber. The following morning, the Senate reflected on the confrontation and changed procedures with a view to limit the opportunity for insults. Hanson-Young says decorum in the parliament has deteriorated over the decade she\u2019s been in the Senate, and \u201cwomen cop the brunt of that\u201d. \u201cThe type of robust debate that is continually used in this place \u2013 the line is more often crossed with women, when the attacks and the insults become very personal and very gendered.\u201d She said some of the behaviour was unintentional but oftentimes it was deliberate, with the intention of destroying the confidence of female representatives. Some of the behaviour was becoming more brazen, she said. Abuse that used to be whispered in her early years in politics was now \u201cshouted\u201d and there was \u201ca bit of a pack mentality\u201d. Hanson-Young said standards in parliament were now demonstrably out of step with those in other Australian workplaces, and a permissive culture of self-regulation meant there weren\u2019t meaningful sanctions to deter transgressions. In practical terms, the parliament was \u201ca law unto ourselves\u201d. She said a code of conduct, with meaningful sanctions, would help stop behaviour that the parliament deemed inappropriate. Hanson-Young said she had been buoyed by the level of support she received from the public and from colleagues inside parliament after deciding to be be vocal about gendered abuse. She said some male colleagues had told her they had been paralysed when witnessing examples of poor conduct, not sure whether intervening would make things worse, which had given her pause for thought. Some people would be \u201cmorons\u201d and would never change, but she said \u201cdecent\u201d men did not want to tolerate bad conduct from their peers towards women. \u201cLet\u2019s help them to know what to do when that happens.\u201d Hanson-Young also acknowledged that poor behaviour existed in political parties across the board, including in the Greens. No political party had \u201ca monopoly on respect for women\u201d or could claim to have a perfect culture when it came to their treatment. \u201cHiding from it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d she said. \u201cConfronting it head on saying \u2018that process wasn\u2019t right, let\u2019s put something better in place\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s what we are working through and we shouldn\u2019t pretend we are not.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
