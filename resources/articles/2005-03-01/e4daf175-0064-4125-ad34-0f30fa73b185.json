Last year, I travelled with Exodus (0870 2405550, exodus.co.uk) on a very good eight-day Highlights of Libya trip, which included three nights in the east, with excellent local guides round the sites. Susan Harvey Consider carefully whether you wish to visit on your own or not. You might find it easier to go on a package tour from an adventure operator - you will have full security and will get to see the remains around Leptis Magna, plus the archaeology and second world war battlefields of the east - and it will be cheaper, too. I recommend Dragoman (0870 4994475, dragoman.com) and The Adventure Company (0870 794 1009, adventurecompany.co.uk).
