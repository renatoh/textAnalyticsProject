The latest blog summary is here. Thank you as always for reading, and for your comments. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal praises his colleagues for laying off the immigration thing a bit. He says he\u2019s relieved that it appears Lynch will be considered on her merits. \u201cThey\u2019re not making this a referendum on the president\u2019s immigration policy or decisions,\u201d he says. Sessions wants to know how Lynch feels about marijuana. He quotes President Barack Obama. \u201cThe president said, quote \u2018I smoked pot as a kid... I don\u2019t think it is more dangerous than alcohol.\u2019\u201d Does Lynch agree? \u201cWell senator, I certainly don\u2019t hold that view. I think the president was speaking from his personal experience and his personal opinion, neither of which I share,\u201d Lynch says. Lynch said legalization of marijuana is not justice department policy and not her policy. Jeff Sessions is back. \u201cDo you believe that the executive action announced by president Obama [in November deferring deportation for up to 5 million immigrants] is legal and constitutional?\u201d \u201cAs I\u2019ve read the opinion, I do believe it is,\u201d Lynch says. Sessions says that\u2019s troubling, in part because the action provides for work permits for migrants which he says can \u201ctake jobs.\u201d The first round of questions is through. We have arrived at another temporary adjournment. Thom Tillis, the new senator from North Carolina, Lynch\u2019s home state, is up. He asks about election laws. He asks whether Lynch will try to take apart state laws to restrict voting rights stop what some on the right call \u201cvoter fraud\u201d (which does not functionally exist). \u201cI believe that the right to vote obviously is the cornerstone of our democracy,\u201d Lynch says. Lynch says the department\u2019s prevailing concern is \u201cprotecting the right to vote.\u201d However not all voter ID laws are problematic, she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can at this point.. say which way the department will go in viewing it... it is something the department of justice has a responsibility to review.\u201d Grassley\u2019s back. Roomful of chatter. The judiciary committee is having a temporary senator shortage and has momentarily adjourned. They\u2019re all off voting, presumably. Perdue asks Lynch about consecutive mandatory minimum sentences, and whether she would consent to early release in some cases. \u201cIt would not be my place to consent to an early release,\u201d she says. The prosecutor would consent to calling for review by a judge. \u201cThe ultimate decision on release would not be made, I believe, by me.\u201d \u201cSince I\u2019m the only one here, I guess I\u2019m the presiding officer,\u201d Perdue says. \u201cMy time is almost up.\u201d And then there was one. Perdue is on about his third or fourth question. The Guardian\u2019s Amanda Holpuch (@holpuch) reports from the White House, where principal deputy press secretary Eric Schultz offered animated praise for Lynch at a press briefing this afternoon. Amanda reports: \u201cDon\u2019t take my word for it \u2013 this might be the first and only time we cite Bill O\u2019 Reilly from the podium, but just a few days ago he called her a \u2018hero\u2019 and \u2018happy that she\u2019s the new attorney general,\u2019\u201d Schultz said. He said that the administration believes Lynch \u201cwill be just as strong an attorney general as Eric Holder was.\u201d When asked how that could be true, in spite of Lynch saying that she was not Eric Holder in her opening statement, Schultz said: \u201cI didn\u2019t get a chance to read Loretta Lynch\u2019s opening statement, but she may have just been being literal.\u201d Democratic Senator Christopher Coons asks about prosecuting trade secret theft, saying he is concerned about the \u201chuge transfer of wealth going on through trade secret theft.\u201d Lynch says they don\u2019t have specific indictments under the trade secrets aact, but perpetrators have been prosecuted under other statutes. The cases tend to be complicated and long-term, she says,. Lynch is defending her judgment that the legal underpinnings for executive actions on immigration are \u201creasonable,\u201d in a mildly confrontational exchange with Senator David Vitter of Louisiana. She describes the distinct roles of the justice department and the department of homeland security, directed by Jeh Johnson. Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah: \u2018she\u2019s good\u2019 Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, thanks Lynch for \u201cyour very forthright and erudite answers.\u201d He praises her for her work as a prosecutor to break up sex trafficking rings. Blumenthal asks her if the country needs stronger human trafficking laws, and whether there should be mandatory restitution for victims. Lynch says the issue of restitution is important. \u201cWhere we can, we always do seek a restitution order for the victims.\u201d She says \u201ccertain small cities in Mexico\u201d have been located as the source of sex slaves trafficked to her New York district. She said US authorities have worked with Mexican authorities to break up the ring. \u201cShould I become attorney general, it will be one of my priorities,\u201d she says. Deputy press secretary Eric Shultz is handling the White House briefing today. He seeks to clarify Lynch\u2019s remarks about not being Eric Holder: Franken closes with a joke, too. \u201cI\u2019ll probably vote for you,\u201d he says. The room cracks up again. Grassley cuts Cruz off rather abruptly. Now it\u2019s Al Franken of Minnesota. He congratulates Grassley on becoming chairman. \u201cI\u2019m glad to be chairman,\u201d Grassley says. \u201cI know you are,\u201d Franken deadpans. Having just won reelection, is Franken loosening up? \u201cHow was lunch?\u201d he asks Lynch. \u201cExcellent, thank you sir,\u201d she replies. Cruz wants to talk about immigration. He asks Lynch whether she agrees with the legal analysis in the OLC opinion. \u201cI did not see a grant of amnesty there, or a pathway to citizenship. Certainly as I read the opinion... it seemed to be a way to look for a framework... to prioritize removal of the most dangerous\u201d undocumented immigrants,\u201d Lynch says. Cruz asks her if she would have made the same argument. \u201cI certainly am not able to say if my legal analysis would have taken the same pathway,\u201d Lynch says. \u201cFor some of the requested actions, the OLC found that there was not the legal framework\u201d for proposed homeland security immigration enforcement policy shifts. Cruz accuses Lynch of not answering the question. \u201cYou are a very talented lawyer, and so I suspect it is not an accident that you have not answered the question,\u201d Cruz says. \u201cI did find the analysis to be reasonable,\u201d she says. Cruz lectures Lynch on how terrible a job he thinks Eric Holder has done. He asks her how her tenure would differ from Holder\u2019s. Lynch returns to what she said before about the unique role of the attorney general as a cabinet member beholden first to the people and constitution. \u201cYou\u2019ve asked how I would be different from Eric Holder? I will be Loretta Lynch.\u201d They\u2019re back. And look who\u2019s up: Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. He says his friends in the law world in New York have contacted him and praised Lynch. Her congratulates her for this. As our live coverage of attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch\u2019s confirmation hearing continues, here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: Lynch gracefully handled Republican questions about the legality of executive actions on immigration, justice department independence and the legacy of her prospective predecessor, Eric Holder. The nominee exited the morning session with few or zero signs of threats to her nomination. \u201cI think you\u2019ll be a great attorney general\u201d if you remain independent, the senior Republican on the committee said. Lynch delivered a moving opening statement in which she recounted memories of growing up in a racially segregated South and paid tribute to her parents\u2019 sacrifices and guidance. Republicans diagnosed \u201ca massive refusal to enforce existing law\u201d in the current justice department and invited Lynch to distance herself from Holder. \u201cLet me just stipulate, you\u2019re not Eric Holder, are you?\u201d asked Senator John Cornyn. \u201cNo senator, I\u2019m not,\u201d Lynch replied, to laughs. Lynch offered a measured defense of the executive actions on immigration, however, echoing the White House line that the policies did not offer \u201camnesty\u201d but set priorities for deportation. Lynch stated flatly that \u201cwaterboarding is torture\u201d and \u201cthus illegal.\u201d On the need to renew Fisa provisions allowing dragnet surveillance, Lynch said that as a prosecutor she recognized the provisions \u201chave been invaluable tools.\u201d She said it was also important \u201cto protect privacy.\u201d Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, thanks Lynch \u201cfor your grace under pressure.\u201d They adjourn for lunch till 1.35pm. Senator Leahy has a hot mic moment. Sounds like he\u2019s a \u2018Yes\u2019: \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ve been so moved by any nominee for anything.\u201d It\u2019s a full house in Dirksen: Utah Senator Mike Lee is asking Lynch about civil forfeiture, in which the government seizes assets of targets of federal investigations. \u201cI think that a number of people would have questions about how the department of justice manages its asset forfeiture program,\u201d Lynch says. Cornyn diagnoses \u201ca massive refusal to enforce existing law in these executive actions.\u201d Lynch: \u201cI do not view the DoJ as refusing to enforce laws but in intending to set priorities.\u201d Cornyn asks whether it\u2019s not incumbent on DoJ to seek more money from Congress to make sure they, the justice department, can do their job. Cornyn insists that if Holder had asked Congress for more resources to enforce immigration laws... and then not even Cornyn can finish the thought. Cornyn asks Lynch how she will be different from Holder. \u201cIf confirmed as attorney general, I will be myself,\u201d Lynch says. \u201cI will be Loretta Lynch.\u201d Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, another sharp critic of the Obama administration, is up. He starts with a joke. \u201cLet me just stipulate, you\u2019re not Eric Holder, are you?\u201d \u201cNo senator, I\u2019m not,\u201d Lynch replies, to laughter in the room. \u201cNo one\u2019s suggesting that you are, but his legacy is heavy on our minds, here,\u201d Cornyn says. \u201cWhile we\u2019ve stipulated you\u2019re not Eric Holder, Mr Holder\u2019s record is certainly on our minds, because I can\u2019t think of an attorney general... who operated as a politician using the awesome power conferred\u201d on his office,\u201d Cornyn says. Sessions asks Lynch whether she would prosecute US businesses who decline to hire immigrants whose deportation has been deferred in favor of \u201clawful citizens.\u201d She hedges. They are going to talk about it more later. Sessions is done, Schumer is up. Sessions is grilling Lynch on whether undocumented immigrants have a right to a job, moreso than \u201clawful citizens.\u201d \u201cWe want everyone to seek employment, but we have in place a legal framework that requests and requires employers to ask questions about citizenship,\u201d she says. Some friction between Sessions and Lynch on whether immigration is a civil rights issue. Sessions quotes Holder as saying a pathway to citizenship \u201cis essential\u201d and calling immigration a matter of \u201ccivil and human rights.\u201d The question: does an undocumented migrant have a civil right to citizenship? \u201cYou do touch on the difficult issue of how we treat arrivals to our shores,\u201d she begins. \u201cI don\u2019t want to interrupt you,\u201d Sessions interrupts. \u201cDo you agree with that statement, that it\u2019s a matter of civil rights?\u201d \u201cSenator I haven\u2019t studied the issue enough to come to a legal opinion on that,\u201d Lynch says. She says it would have to be decided on a case-by case basis. Is it a civil right? Sessions insists. \u201cI think that citizenship is a privilege. Certainly it\u2019s a right for those of us who are born here,\u201d Lynch says. She says under the panoply of civil rights as they now are enumerated, she does not see protection for migrants being mentioned. \u201cI\u2019m surprised it took you so long to say that,\u201d Sessions says. Are you able to tell the president \u201cNo\u201d if he asks a legal opinion you believe is wrong? Lynch has answered this question a few times already, but she now reveals new things to say about it: \u201cI believe you have touched on one of the most important responsibilities of the attorney general,\u201d Lynch says. \u201cThe attorney general has a unique responsibility to provide independent and objective advice to the president.\u201d Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, one of the fiercest critics of the administration\u2019s immigration policies, is next. Here\u2019s video of that \u201cwaterboarding is torture\u201d moment: Lynch talks about government surveillance, in reply to a Feinstein question about expiring provisions of Fisa, in June, including roving wiretap authority; lone wolf authority to surveil non-US person suspected of terror plotting without demonstrating ; and business records authority, including section 215 of the Patriot Act, the provision the government uses to sweep up phone records. Lynch pays lip service to privacy concerns, but testifies most forcefully about her personal experience, as a prosecutor, of the value of surveillance harvests. She says there\u2019s a need \u201cto have a full panoply.\u201d Lynch says the roving wiretap ability was used in narcotics prosecutions before it was part of Fisa. The capability, for prosecutors, \u201chave been invaluable tools,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is judicial review for this... it has been an important part, as have the other two provisions,\u201d she says. She says the government must take care to stay current with the latest technology \u201cbut also to protect privacy.\u201d She says any curtailing of Fisa capabilities must be considered \u201cwith a full and complete understanding of the risks that we\u2019re facing.\u201d Feinstein seems pleased with that answer. Feinstein, like Leahy, praises Lynch\u2019s opening testimony. She\u2019s heard six prospective attorneys general give such statements, Feinstein says. \u201cYours was the best\u201d: I see the combination of steel and velvet.. and I see the determination which is in your heart, and I think your being. It\u2019s very, very impressive. Hatch is over. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, is up. Lynch moves on to privacy standards for accessing digital data, and cyber crime. \u201cThe subject of electronic privacy is central to so many of our freedoms,\u201d Lynch says. \u201cWe have to be vigilant.\u201d She promises to work with Congress to protect electronic privacy. A warm moment between Hatch, the senior Republican in the Senate, and Lynch, just now. Hatch: How can you assure us that you\u2019ll say \u2018no\u2019 to the White House when they wish to act outside the law? The DoJ has to provide a legal framework, but must also advise when that framework does not exist, Lynch says. \u201cI pledge to you that I take that independence seriously,\u201d she says. \u201cI think you\u2019ll be a great attorney general if you do that,\u201d Hatch says. Hatch asks Lynch for one-word answers. Will she defend the constitution regardless of her personal views? Yes, she says. Hatch says Holder answered the question the same way, then failed to defend the defense of marriage act. Lynch has a good answer for him: \u201cIt\u2019s my view that when it comes to the position of attorney general... the issue is not my personal view... but it is the duty of the DoJ to defend those statutes.\u201d \u201cThere may be certain circumstances where careful legal analysis raises constitutional issues, but I expect those would be few and far between.\u201d Hatch: \u201cI appreciate that answer.\u201d Lynch reiterates that she was not involved in the president\u2019s executive actions on immigration. Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah is next. \u201cI\u2019m impressed with your qualifications,\u201d Hatch says. Leahy lists terrorism and national security cases Lynch has prosecuted, including, recently, two members of the Taliban who attacked US soldiers in Afghanistan. \u201cIf terrorists threaten American citizens here or abroad, they will face American justice,\u201d Lynch says. Leahy asks her about torture. \u201cWaterboarding is torture, senator. And thus illegal,\u201d Lynch says. Leahy is up. He asks about policing and community tensions. Lynch: \u201cWhat I have found most effective is getting people together and simply listening to their concerns. Being open. And getting people to see that we are all, in fact, in this together.\u201d She says \u201cone of the most important roles\u201d of the justice department is provide grants and training to local law enforcement. Grassley turns to allegations of inappropriate targeting several years ago on the part of the IRS of conservative nonprofit groups for audit. A House report last year found no evidence of wrongdoing. But Grassley says the FBI has said there is an ongoing criminal investigation, but the Obama administration has said there was no wrongdoing. How do you resolve the two, Grassley asks? \u201cI am generally aware that there is an investigation going on\u201d but it\u2019s not in my office, Lynch says. Any bias is unacceptable, she says. Grassley accuses Obama of commenting publicly on an ongoing investigation. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of the context of the president\u2019s remarks,\u201d she says. The questions are trying to be bombshells. Lynch, with her practiced and even replies, makes them feel like softballs. What are the outer limits of the doctrine of prosecutorial discretion? When millions of people are affected? Grassley asks. Lynch says when she reviewed the OLC opinion, \u201cI viewed it a way in which the DHS was seeking legal guidance\u201d on how to prioritize removing a large number of individuals, given that removal of everyone was possible. She frames the executive action, as the Obama administration has, not as an \u201camnesty\u201d but as a way to accelerate the deportation undocumented felons, terror threats and other undesirables. Lynch says \u201ccertainly I was not involved in the executive actions\u201d that you describe. But she has looked at the OLC opinion through which the DHS sought legal guidance. \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason to doubt the reasonableness of those views,\u201d she says. The ultimate responsibility of the justice department is to make sure there is a legal framework for any executive action. She says such a framework was not appropriately erected in the case of all the executive actions. First question: Obama\u2019s action to defer deportation of up to 5m undocumented immigrants of last November. Grassley calls it a \u201cdangerous abuse of executive authority.\u201d Was that legal? Grassley asks. The judiciary committee has published Lynch\u2019s opening statement on its web site. You can read it here (pdf). Lynch turns to policing and race. She praises police officers. \u201cI have served with them. I have learned from them,\u201d she says. \u201cFew things have pained me more than the recent reports of divisions\u201d between police and communities, she says. \u201cOne of my key priorities would be to strengthen the vital relationship between our courageous law enforcement personnel and all the communities they serve,\u201d she says. Lynch describes alleged terrorism plots her office has prosecuted, including, she says, planned attacks on New York subways, JFK airport, the federal reserve bank of New York and troops abroad, as well as \u201cthose who have provided support to foreign terrorist organizations.\u201d She promises not to just protect \u201cAmerican citizens, but American values.\u201d Other areas of prosecutorial focus she lists include cybercrime, cyber fraud, child pornography, and international human trafficking rings. Lynch says her mother, Lorine, was \u201cunable to travel here today.\u201d She talks about her mother\u2019s career as a librarian and English teacher. \u201cAs a young woman, she refused to use segregated restrooms, because they did not represent the America in which she believed,\u201d Lynch says. She would become the second African-American to serve as attorney general, after Holder, and the second woman in the role, after Janet Reno. She describes her father\u2019s career as a minister. He organized sit-ins to end segregation, she says, with her sitting on his shoulders. \u201cFrom my parents, I gained the tenacity and resolve to take on violent criminals... and to disrupt organized crime. ... Their values have sustained me.\u201d Lynch says one of her favorite moments as a district attorney is welcoming new young prosecutors and administering the oath of office. She oversees about 170 lawyers as US attorney for the Eastern District of New York. \u201cThe constitution... will be my lodestar,\u201d Lynch promises. Lynch introduces her father, husband, brother and sister in law. Her father, Lorenzo Lynch, a fourth-generation Baptist minister, is wearing a big smile. He waves. Lynch begins her opening statement. She does not seem nervous, if it needs saying. Here\u2019s Loretta Lynch. She takes an oath and sits down. Schumer says, if the Senate can\u2019t confirm Lynch, the Senate can\u2019t confirm anybody. Which, we\u2019ll see. He warns that the point of the hearing isn\u2019t to argue over the president\u2019s immigration policy, but to consider Loretta Lynch\u2019s nomination as attorney general. AP has obtained parts of Lynch\u2019s prepared testimony, which has not yet been posted to the committee web site. Lynch plans to say: \u201cI pledge to all of you and to the American people that I will fulfill my responsibilities with integrity and independence,\u201d she said in remarks prepared for the panel... In prepared testimony, Lynch pledged better relations with Capitol Hill. \u201cI look forward to fostering a new and improved relationship with this committee, the United States Senate, and the entire United States Congress \u2014 a relationship based on mutual respect and constitutional balance,\u201d Lynch said. In her prepared testimony, Lynch promised a fresh start in that relationship, too. \u201cFew things have pained me more than the recent reports of tension and division between law enforcement and the communities we serve,\u201d Lynch said, pledging to \u201cwork to strengthen the vital relationships\u201d if confirmed. Schumer says Lynch has \u201cone of the keenest legal minds our country has to offer.\u201d He points out that Lynch\u2019s late brother, Lorenzo, was a Navy SEAL. Her second brother is called Loenzo; her parents are Lorenzo Sr and Lorine. The notoriously camera-loving Schumer gets a laugh out of the hearing room. \u201cShe\u2019s always known for keeping her head down, and avoiding the spotlight,\u201d he says. \u201cJust like me.\u201d Guffaw. \u201cI\u2019m confident that if we stay focused on Ms. Lynch\u2019s impeccable qualifications and fierce independence,\u201d she will be confirmed quickly, Leahy concludes. Now the New York senators attending the panel get to introduce Lynch. They are Democrats Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand. Ranking member Patrick Leahy, the longest-serving senator, the Democrat from Vermont, says he hopes everyone remembers the hearing is about Loretta Lynch, not about \u201ceverything that\u2019s wrong with the country.\u201d Leahy sketches Lynch\u2019s career and accomplishments. You can read a Guardian profile of Lynch here: Take it from the lawyer who squared off against her in her most high-profile case as a prosecutor: Loretta Lynch will emerge unscathed from her confirmation hearings to become the 83rd attorney general of the United States of America. \u201cI think she\u2019ll ace the hearing, and I think she\u2019ll have absolutely no problem convincing the United States Senate that she\u2019ll be a great attorney,\u201d said lawyer Marvyn Kornberg on Tuesday. Full piece here. Beefs with the justice department Grassley has run through include the Fast and Furious gun-walking controversy, failure to investigate security leaks and the expansion of executive power. \u201cThese positions aren\u2019t mainstream, in my judgment,\u201d Grassley says. He says the through line is a justice department that is \u201cvery deeply politicized.\u201d And blame for that, he says, lies at the top, with \u201can attorney general who views himself, and these are his own words, as \u2018the president\u2019s wingman\u2019.\u201d \u201cHow about restoring faith in the bedrock principals like the respect for the rule of law?\u201d Grassley says in his opening statement. There\u2019s an implicit criticism there somewhere. He says public confidence in the justice department\u2019s ability to do its job without regard to politics \u201chas been shaken, with good reason.\u201d It\u2019s not just a Republican critique, he says. \u201cI want everyone to know that I\u2019m prepared to stay here as long as members have questions that they\u2019d like to ask,\u201d committee chair Chuck Grassley says. \u201cThis is a very important position in the cabinet and we should do all that we can to move it along, according to our rules,\u201d he says. They expect to keep the hearing going during midday votes, he says. Five minutes until the hearing is scheduled to begin. Your C-SPAN link is here. Your judiciary committee who\u2019s who is here. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of Senate confirmation hearings on the nomination of Loretta Lynch to become the nation\u2019s 83rd attorney general. Lynch, 55, is a star prosecutor with a reputation for extreme preparedness and evenness under pressure. But she is going before a judiciary committee stacked with Republican senators who have bedeviled the current attorney general, Eric Holder, and who might be said to be eager not to squander a high-profile chance to trash the Barack Obama administration. We can expect Lynch to take a grilling over the president\u2019s executive actions on immigration and the climate, over justice department cooperation with congressional investigations, over terrorism prosecutions, federal investigations of police departments and much more. Committee chairman Chuck Grassley, the senior senator from Iowa, has promised to allow his colleagues time to ask their every question. \u201cIt\u2019s going to go on as long as it takes to get it done. But I hope it doesn\u2019t take more than one day,\u201d Grassley told the National Journal, speaking, one dares say, for all of America. It\u2019s important for the White House to secure a smooth confirmation for Lynch, whose nomination is designed to eliminate, not create, political headaches. Join us as we cover every side of what promises to be one of the more exciting and theatrical episodes on Capitol Hill this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
