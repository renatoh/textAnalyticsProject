A lawyer, author and a doctor \u2013 he\u2019s quite the renaissance man. GOAL OF THE DAY For much of the season Riyad Mahrez has been the only reason to watch Leicester, and he proved that again with a ruthless strike against Southampton to seal the Foxes\u2019 sixth win in the last seven games. NUMBER OF THE DAY 53: number of goals conceded by Spurs in the Premier League. Only Leicester, Newcastle and QPR have let in more. STRATEGY OF THE DAY Hats off to Sunderland, who managed to secure a win against Everton with two goals, neither of which were scored intentionally. Safety should be assured. MIXED EMOTIONS OF THE DAY Even as the glory of his election victory wears off, David Cameron must have been distraught that his beloved West Ham lost, a blow cushioned by his beloved Aston Villa being the team that beat them. METAPHOR OF THE DAY \u201cIf Sunderland beat Everton that would really throw the pigeon among the cats\u201d \u2013 Paul Merson likens Dick Advocaat\u2019s strugglers to a kamikaze bird. BAD WEEK FOR ... We hope Alastair Campbell was OK on Saturday. After a week in which his Labour party were demolished in the polls, forcing him into eating his own kilt, his Burnley team were relegated into the Championship. His book Winners: And How They Succeed is still available in all good bookshops."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
