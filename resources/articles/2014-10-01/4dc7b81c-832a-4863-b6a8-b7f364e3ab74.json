Bear with me ...", "bodyText": "Here we are,\u201d the cab driver laughed as he pulled up outside the Wainscott Memorial hall. \u201cThe arsehole of Kent.\u201d That wasn\u2019t quite the description David Cameron used when he arrived half an hour later to give a brief call-to-arms and introduce the two hopefuls, Anna Firth and Kelly Tolhurst, seeking the Tory nomination for the Rochester and Strood byelection precipitated by the defection of the sitting Conservative MP, Mark Reckless, to Ukip. Yet even Wainscott\u2019s most loyal residents are hard pushed to describe their hall as anything other than basic; hope more usually comes here in the shape of WI and spiritualist meetings than the PM. These are strange times: a referendum wrapped in two byelections inside an eight-month general election campaign. Stranger still that Cameron should be as toxic on the edges of Essex and Kent as he was in Scotland; he daren\u2019t go out to do meet-and-greets in the streets in case he\u2019s heckled or asked something tricky, \u2013 don\u2019t mention Lord Freud anyone \u2013 so his appearance on Thursday was limited to a handful of local residents who could be relied on not to make trouble. A handful of retired Tory party members, including one man in knee-length woollen socks and faded khaki shorts; the sort of people on whom the empire has never set. Not forgetting a couple of black faces \u2013 a deal-breaker rider in every rentacrowd contract for the Dave Roadshow. Cameron bustled into the hall and made a quick bid to reinvent himself as David Farage, Nigel\u2019s more sober younger brother. He understood the concerns of local residents, he\u2019d even driven through Kent several times to the Eurotunnel en route to the Dordogne, and, if they would just bear with him, he\u2019d give them everything that Ukip had already promised. Last week it was Vote Ukip, Get Labour; now the message had shifted to Vote Tory, Get Ukip. A few Conservative old-timers nodded appreciatively at this, though they might just have been nodding off. It was nearly lunchtime, after all. First up on the hustings after the prime minister\u2019s introduction was Anna Firth, a local barrister. She lost her audience the moment she opened her mouth. The Tories aren\u2019t going to hold off Ukip with a candidate straight from central casting and a voice that sounds like a radio presenter from the 1950s. \u201cThis is the Home service,\u201d she said. \u201cToday I want to talk to you about hospitals, schools and preserving the village green \u2026 \u201d Radio static from decades past mercifully filled the airwaves and blocked out the rest of her address. Then came Tolhurst, a larger than life local woman who talked as if she\u2019d happily take Reckless out in under three rounds. She\u2019d picked up her Brownie badge for pest control in this very hall. \u201cI, too, want three things,\u201d she insisted. They must have both been told by Tory High Command they were only allowed to want three things. \u201cI want better hospitals. I want better schools. And secondly, I want ... \u201d Maths may not have been Kelly\u2019s strong point. The differences between the two candidates became even more marked when the audience was invited to ask questions. \u201cWill you ever lie to us like Mark Reckless?\u201d one man asked. \u201cNo, no, no, I have a theory ... \u201d said Anna, who had by now morphed into Monty Python\u2019s Anne Elk. Kelly was rather more equivocal, with a cunning use of a possible double negative. \u201cAbsolutely not, I will not lie to you,\u201d she said. As there has been some uncertainty about her age during the campaign she was probably wise to hedge her bets. On policing they were both very much in favour of maximum force and SWAT teams. \u201cI have another theory,\u201d said Anne Elk. \u201cThe police are needed for the night-time economy,\u201d said Kelly. \u201cThey are also needed for the daytime economy.\u201d Dusk and daybreak didn\u2019t get a mention. \u201cThe thing about drug dealers,\u201d she continued, \u201cis that you don\u2019t often get to see them.\u201d She will go far in Rochester: if not to Westminster then at least to seeing her name on the ballot paper. Having competed with one another to deport as many immigrants as possible at a hustings from which the media had been barred the previous night, Cameron wisely decided not to let either Anna or Kelly take any questions on that subject. Instead, he fielded it himself. \u201cCan you reassure us that ethnic minorities won\u2019t be singled out when we start throwing out immigrants?\u201d asked one of the black men. Dave\u2019s face furrowed with a concern of the highest possible order as he channelled his \u201cSome of my best friends are black\u201d voice. \u201cI\u2019m glad you mentioned this. I get constant phone calls from black people about this,\u201d he said, implying there was a black person\u2019s Downing Street helpline rather than an occasional call from Barack Obama. \u201cEthnic minorities absolutely will not become targets.\u201d To underline the point, and to re-establish his sensitivity for race relations, he later said: \u201cThere will be no lynching here.\u201d That\u2019s nice. What there also wouldn\u2019t be in Dave\u2019s modern, Conservakipper world were any Brits being press-ganged into a European army. Nor a foreign flag flying over Downing Street. The Union Jack, which had drooped over Rochester Castle throughout the morning, fluttered briefly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
