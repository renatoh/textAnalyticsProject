GOAL OF THE DAY Juan Mata's first: an expert \u00a337m free-kick curler into Newcastle's top corner. STAT OF THE DAY The latest on Vincent Tan's Cardiff revolution: after averaging 0.9 points per game under reckless, no-good Malky Mackay, they're now on 0.62 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. ROUGHEST JUSTICE Before Norwich's game Chris Hughton said that handing out free cardboard \"Canary Clappers\" to fans to boost the atmosphere could give his side the edge. The outcome: a 1-0 defeat and Hughton hit by a Clapper. CHANT OF THE DAY \"You've got to sell all your players,\" taunted cash-rich Man City fans at the Southampton crowd \u2013 before segueing into: \"We're going to buy all your players\". MOST RUTHLESS Gareth McAuley's no-nonsense hoof into the stand \u2013 sending a West Brom club laptop to laptop heaven. OMEN OF THE DAY When things are going well, they stay going well. Brendan Rodgers had the winner in Liverpool's Grand National sweepstake. BEST TEAM TALK Droylsden finished their troubling first half away at Chorley in the Evo-Stik Northern Premier League 7-1 down, including two own goals. They tightened up after the break, and ran out 13-1 losers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
