Liverpool opened up a seven-point gap at the top, at least until City have played Wolves on Monday night, with a largely forgettable win at Brighton on Saturday but there are few illusions inside the dressing room that, their heads cleared from losing narrowly to their rivals for top spot 10 days ago, the next four months will turn into a procession. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how you get there,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cWe know it\u2019s going to go right to the wire. City are a fantastic team and we believe we are a really good team. It\u2019s going to go right to the wire: there are still a lot of big games to come and we [have to] just keep knocking them off.\u201d The victory over Chris Hughton\u2019s side, earned through Mohamed Salah\u2019s 49th-minute penalty, will occupy minimal space in the end-of-season highlights compilations but Robertson pointed out that it does not stand alone. \u201cThe two Brighton games have been massive for us,\u201d he said, recalling how Liverpool struggled to a similarly hard-fought 1-0 win at Anfield in August. Their knack for coming out on top during days of relative drudgery is perhaps the most eye-catching difference in this season\u2019s team and it provides as much satisfaction as those games when they manage to cut loose. \u201cIt\u2019s just the winning mentality and finding a way,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what all the teams are doing now. City haven\u2019t played their best but have been winning games and Tottenham have done the same, so I think we are all showing signs of doing that. Whoever wins the league will look back on some games and go \u2018Do you know what, we probably weren\u2019t at our best there, and that was probably one that helped us turn one point into three or zero into one\u2019.\u201d Moments like the second-half block Fabinho produced from Pascal Gross certainly contribute to that feeling. The Brazilian was asked to deputise in Liverpool\u2019s short-staffed centre-back position and, after one early blip when he let Glenn Murray escape and saw the Brighton striker head over from a good position, mastered the occasion well. \u201cI thought he was different class,\u201d Robertson said. Fabinho has overcome a quiet start at Liverpool to be increasingly influential, albeit mainly from his favoured midfield role, in recent weeks and Robertson drew parallels with his own adaptation after joining from Hull City in July 2017. \u201cI think all the lads that have come in have experienced very similar,\u201d he said. \u201cMe and Chambo [Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain] experienced it last season, Naby [Ke\u00efta] is experiencing it a wee bit now, Fabinho has experienced it, Shaq [Xherdan Shaqiri] has experienced it. It\u2019s just learning, and of course the massive expectations that come with playing for Liverpool sometimes take a wee bit of getting used to. It did for me, and once I got used to it I\u2019ve not really looked back, in my opinion. Fabinho took his time and now we are getting the rewards from it.\u201d Liverpool will travel to Dubai for a warm weather training camp after Saturday\u2019s match with Crystal Palace, having been freed up to do so by a skeleton side\u2019s 2-1 defeat to Wolves in the FA Cup third round. By then, Fabinho should be primed for a return to the engine room. J\u00fcrgen Klopp hopes Jo\u00ebl Matip, who was on the bench at Brighton but not ready to start after recovering from a fractured collarbone, will benefit from the gap in their fixture list along with Dejan Lovren and Joe Gomez, who may both be available by the end of the month. Although he would never say so, Robertson might appreciate a slowing down in the schedule. On Thursday his wife, Rachel, gave birth to their second child \u2013 a daughter named Aria \u2013 and he had to leave them the following day to travel with the team. His performance did not miss a beat, one fizzing first-half cross almost resulting in a goal for Roberto Firmino. On the pitch, the next four months will be about negotiating every bump in the road and letting as little speculation as possible reach their ears. \u201cLook, we hope we are here to stay,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cWe let everyone else talk because the only pressure for us is playing for Liverpool, and that\u2019s enough pressure. And we can deal with that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
