Louisiana, a major US hotspot, was the first southern state to categorize Covid-19 deaths by race. On Monday Governor John Bel Edwards announced that a shocking 70% of deaths were among African Americans, despite making up only 33% of the state\u2019s population. The virus has spread to nearly every parish in the state, but the worst of the outbreak has been focused on New Orleans, a majority-black city with one of the country\u2019s highest metro poverty rates. In Georgia, an incomplete data picture still shows African Americans \u2013 who make up 33% of the state\u2019s population, compared with 60% for whites \u2013 are being hit disproportionately hard by the virus. On Wednesday Georgia\u2019s department of public health began releasing the racial breakdown of confirmed coronavirus cases. Twenty per cent of the 9,901 confirmed coronavirus cases are black, compared with 15% who are white. But the vast majority of cases \u2013 64% \u2013 are of an \u201cunknown race\u201d. A spokesperson said the agency was working to retroactively collect the missing information on race. Mississippi\u2019s department of health has yet to release any information on the racial breakdown of coronavirus\u2019s impact. But in an emailed statement a spokesperson said: \u201cAt this time, the African American community seems to be hit hard.\u201d In Alabama, a similar story is playing out. Data released on Tuesday by the state\u2019s department of public health showed black Alabamians are being infected and killed by the virus at a disproportionate rate. Black and white patients made up an equal proportion of deaths, at about 44% each. But, of the over 2,000 infections confirmed statewide by 6 April, only 37% were black, while 50% were white. Alabama\u2019s population is about 27% black and 69% white, according to the latest census data. South Carolina is reporting 36% of Covid-19 cases are African American, compared with 56% white. Those numbers appear to be based on about 1,000 cases, less than half of the state\u2019s current coronavirus tally of 2,417. The department of health did not respond to requests for updated data or a racial breakdown of coronavirus deaths. The Tennessee health department said it plans to release data on race and coronavirus this week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
