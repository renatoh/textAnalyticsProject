Evolutionary theory is studded with missing links, as Charles Darwin himself \u2013 reluctantly coming to the personally mortifying conclusion that the biblical story of the creation was wrong \u2013 was uneasily aware. But it is the disprovability of his theory that makes it so scientifically satisfying. It could so easily be undone by a new discovery, yet (almost) every transitional fossil so far identified has merely confirmed the great man's hypotheses. Perhaps the most important source of these \u2013 including \"Ida\" \u2013 is Messel Pit, which was narrowly rescued from industrial exploitation when Unesco awarded it world heritage site status in 1995. It is uniquely rich in evolutionary evidence, for in it is conserved life on Earth as it was 48 million years ago \u2013 and in such a state of preservation that the last meal eaten by \"Ida\" can be analysed. It provides a unique snapshot of the abundant life of a subtropical valley at a moment of explosive evolution. Already, scientists have identified 31 types of plant fossil, 45 species of mammal and 43 species of bird \u2013 some so swiftly fossilised and so long undisturbed that even colour and the smallest pattern of feather can be detected \u2013 as well as more than a thousand fish. It is a Darwinian cornucopia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
