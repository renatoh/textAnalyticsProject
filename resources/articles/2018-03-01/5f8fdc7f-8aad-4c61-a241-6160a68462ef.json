S\u00e1nchez has scored once in eight appearances, from a penalty rebound against Huddersfield a month ago, and has often been underwhelming since signing from Arsenal in a swap deal involving Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Mourinho said: \u201cWhat is wrong is that he came at the worst moment \u2013 in the winter market. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t like the winter market very much. I think this was a chance that we didn\u2019t want to lose and we made it. \u201cBut we don\u2019t believe a lot in the winter market. And next season it will be better for him. But, of course, he is learning how to play with us and we are learning how to get the best out of him.\u201d Mourinho believes S\u00e1nchez is trying too hard but that this is a positive. \u201cThat\u2019s great. \u201cHe is not afraid to take responsibilities, not afraid to try things. When he feels he\u2019s not as dangerous as he likes to be, he drops back, he tries things, tries to come to areas where we build the play. When he makes mistakes he tries to compensate immediately with fantastic spirit, with a great transition to try to win back the ball. We are very happy.\u201d Mourinho conceded United, who have Marouane Fellaini available again after injury for Saturday\u2019s game against Liverpool, have weaknesses but denied having to accommodate S\u00e1nchez is one. \u201cI don\u2019t consider that a weakness, I consider that a huge potential to be developed,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t tell you the weakness but if you ask the oracles, the oracles will tell you. Some of the guys with an opinion couldn\u2019t resolve their own problems when they were managers, so they are giving opinions like they have solutions for everything. \u201cBut they are in a position where they can give opinions about everything. Sometimes I read and listen, sometimes I don\u2019t. This week I was more focused on enjoying Champions League and Europa League and preparing my match than be focused on opinions.\u201d This appeared to be a reference to Gary Neville and Graeme Souness, two Sky Sports pundits who have criticised United\u2019s style. United are two points ahead of Liverpool as they vie to finish second. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of the result tomorrow that we are going to change the opinions and views [of the sides\u2019 respective styles] and that is not the point for me,\u201d Mourinho said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
