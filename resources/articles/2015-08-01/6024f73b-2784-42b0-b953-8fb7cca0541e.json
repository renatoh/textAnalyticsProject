The Spain winger, 28, came off the bench to score five minutes from the end of extra time, a little more than two hours after Bar\u00e7a\u2019s technical secretary, Robert Fernandez, stated that the player had asked for a transfer. \u201cThe sports director says I said I want out? He shouldn\u2019t say that, I barely talked with him,\u201d Pedro said. \u201cI talked with the president and others. This is a difficult situation for me, of course I wanted to start. I don\u2019t know what will happen, but I will always be a Bar\u00e7a fan. \u201cDo I want to leave? The answer is \u2018no\u2019, but my situation is difficult. It\u2019s not about money, but about more playing time.\u201d Louis van Gaal wants Pedro to strengthen his attack but has been told by Fernandez that United must meet his \u00a321.2m (\u20ac30m) release clause. \u201cPedro asked us for the transfer. We are not going to accept less than \u20ac30m for him, it\u2019s not negotiable,\u201d he said. But a series of Pedro\u2019s club-mates expressed their hope that the player who came through the famed La Masia academy will remain at Camp Nou. \u201cWe hope Pedro continues,\u201d said Javier Mascherano, the former Liverpool midfielder. \u201cHe\u2019s always there in those moments, he\u2019s been touched by the magic wand.\u201d Lionel Messi, who scored twice in the win over Sevilla, added: \u201cThe players and the club don\u2019t know what he is going to do. It is his decision, but whatever he does we wish him the best.\u201d Manchester United, who now expect David de Gea to stay at the club beyond the transfer window, have made Pedro their No1 target to bolster their attack before the end of the transfer window."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
