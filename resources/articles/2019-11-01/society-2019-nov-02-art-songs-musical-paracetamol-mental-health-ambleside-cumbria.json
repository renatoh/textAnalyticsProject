For insomniacs, it\u2019s Sleep, an operatic song by the early 20th-century poet Ivor Gurney. And for anyone feeling anxious, it\u2019s An Evening Hymn, Henry Purcell\u2019s musical version of an obscure 17th-century religious poem. In an experiment that attempts to use the transformative power of poetry and music to improve mental health and wellbeing, people in the Lake District town of Ambleside will be offered these unusual remedies at a special \u201csong surgery\u201d being tried courtesy of the opera singer Bibi Heal. She will tailor the songs she prescribes and performs \u2013 typically very old poems set to classical music, known as \u201cart songs\u201d \u2013 according to the needs of the person who is seeking her help. \u201cWe all know that music, whether you\u2019re performing it or listening to it, has a transformative quality. It can help you to feel better and to reframe how you see your situation,\u201d Heal says. \u201cArt songs are a particularly rich vein to tap. Whether it was Mozart, Brahms or Mahler, the composers and the poets whose works they set to music were flesh and blood, who felt the things we go through now.\u201d These songs are undervalued today, she says. \u201cA wealth of human emotions might be condensed in one song.\u201d They also tend to require more technical training than modern songs because of the vocal range the singer must cover. \u201cThere\u2019s a pure visceral quality of hearing a voice doing things that you may never have heard before, particularly close to you,\u201d Heal explains. This creates an \u201celement of wonder\u201d, and when such a song is then targeted according to the listener\u2019s emotional needs, she believes it can have a dramatic impact. \u201cIf the song can provide an emotional reflection of your life, then you can relate to it and you can see your own truths there in that unfamiliar art form.\u201d The song surgery is the latest example of \u201csocial prescribing\u201d, the trend to prescribe arts treatment to people with psychological and cognitive problems. Last week, the world\u2019s largest study to date of the impact of arts intervention on physical and mental health was launched to help assess whether arts prescriptions can and should be rolled out across the NHS. Heal became interested in the idea of prescribing songs after performing an opera taster tour of care homes and witnessing the impact her music had on patients with dementia. \u201cYou can see very clearly with a dementia sufferer when they get it and when they don\u2019t, and at what point they are awakened and suddenly find joy.\u201d She has been able to reach people with music who are otherwise unreachable, she says. \u201cOne particular elderly lady couldn\u2019t form responses when we tried to have a conversation. She couldn\u2019t remember anything about her husband, about her work \u2013 she didn\u2019t really have a grasp of language, even. We tried to find a way in, we had visual aids, nothing worked. But when I sang La Vie en Rose, she sang along in French.\u201d She knew every word, Heal says. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have any memory at all from any period of her life but she sang that whole song, with me, in French.\u201d In Ambleside, passersby will be invited by performing arts students at Bradford College to have a personal five-minute \u201ctherapy\u201d session with Heal, who will listen to their individual problems before deciding which song to prescribe and offering them a chance to hear her perform it. They will also be given the words of the song, translated into English if necessary, to read and reflect on. She plans to use the hundreds of songs she has learnt to sing over her 20-year career like \u201cmusical paracetamol\u201d to treat particular emotional maladies: \u201cThere is an opportunity to come along and say, \u2018I\u2019m really down\u2019. And we will prescribe what we think you need, as a pick-me-up.\u201d Heal hopes that the unfamiliarity of the songs will add to their emotional power. \u201cI\u2019m interested in seeing if we can get a deeper understanding and a deeper therapeutic response from providing songs that are so multi-layered and not readily available.\u201d The one-day trial is being co-funded by the charity Help Musicians UK and a local arts project, Great Place: Lakes and Dales. Jane Rice-Bowen, Heal\u2019s creative producer, says she is hoping to secure more funding to develop an app, similar to the popular meditation app Headspace, that will allow Heal to compile a programme of prescriptions for anyone to access, and also to track their progress. \u201cThose of us who work within the arts have known for ever that it has a transformative power. But we\u2019ve not always been very good at collecting the case studies and the data, and being able to demonstrate the impact we are having.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
