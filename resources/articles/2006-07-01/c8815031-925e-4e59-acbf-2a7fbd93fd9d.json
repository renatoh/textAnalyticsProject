The first thing to say is that anyone who targets suburban commuter trains is a criminal, whatever cause, grievance, ideology or belief their motivation. The indiscriminate mass murder of innocent people is terrorism, pure and simple. It can never be justified. Shameful attacks such as these are a modern application of the 19th-century nihilistic practice of the \"propaganda of the deed\". The grim years since the 9/11 assault on the US have seen far too many of them - large-scale atrocities in Bali, Casablanca, Istanbul, Madrid and London - so the experience of mangled bodies, collapsing telephone networks, frantic citizens and the cruel testing of emergency services has now been widely shared across the globe. It is too early, in the inevitable confusion and chaos surrounding such an incident, to be certain who might have been responsible for this massacre. With several different bombs detonated it was clearly carefully coordinated and intended to inflict maximum casualties on a soft and crowded rush-hour target. The use of plastic explosives suggests a degree of technical sophistication. Terrorist attacks in India in recent years have been the work of Hindu and Muslim extremists. Kashmiri groups are nevertheless likely to be in the frame, a view which will be bolstered by a grenade attack earlier yesterday in Srinagar, and reports of a non-specific intelligence alert of an impending operation. At such a bleak moment it was heartening to hear the swift and unequivocal condemnation of this outrage from the Pakistani president, Pervez Musharraf, who has overseen a significant thaw in relations with India in recent years. But there are many in India who are already suspicious of the role played by Pakistan's powerful intelligence services in supporting jihadi groups. It would be wrong to jump to any conclusions, and wrong for hotheads to mount reprisals that would only play into the hands of hate-mongering fanatics. Mumbai is a proud and bustling symbol of Indian modernity, the country's commercial and financial capital, its main west coast port, headquarters of most large corporations and of Bollywood, the dazzling film industry. Friends of the world's largest democracy can only pray that it has the courage and resilience to withstand this dreadful and senseless blow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
