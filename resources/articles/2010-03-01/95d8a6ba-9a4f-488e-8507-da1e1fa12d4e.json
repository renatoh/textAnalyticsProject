Dr Polly Taylor, a consultant veterinary surgeon and long-standing member of the government's drugs advisory council, offered her resignation to the home secretary, Alan Johnson, in an email late last night. Taylor is the sixth expert to resign from the committee since the controversial sacking of the chairman, Professor David Nutt, last October. Several other council members are considering their positions, the Guardian has learned. The latest departure follows the publication of guidelines that set out the terms of engagement between ministers and their expert advisers. The guidelines were drawn up by scientists, but later amended by ministers and published as formal \"principles of scientific advice to government\" last week. The revised guidelines have outraged critics, who claim they compromise scientists' independence and could discourage experts from giving objective advice on sensitive matters if it clashes with existing government policy. Taylor's resignation could hamper government plans for a swift ban on the drug mephedrone, or \"meow meow\", which could be ordered by the home secretary as early as tomorrow afternoon. The advisory council on the misuse of drugs (ACMD) is due to review a draft report on mephedrone at 2pm, but according to parliamentary regulations, the council requires a veterinary expert to be properly constituted. Officially, an order to ban a drug can only be put before parliament after consulting with the full council. The council is believed to be in favour of making mephedrone a class B drug, alongside cannabis and speed, meaning dealers would face up to 14 years in prison. Last week, Nutt argued against banning mephedrone, adding that it would be safer to permit the use of the drug by adults under close supervision rather than driving it underground. The \"legal high\" has been linked to four deaths in the past month. Nutt was sacked by the home secretary last year after criticising the government for rejecting recommendations from the ACMD on the classification of cannabis and ecstasy. Two members, Les King and Marion Walker, resigned immediately in protest. Johnson met the ACMD a month later to reassure the expert panel of its independence, but was faced with three more resignations from council members who were not convinced. Other members of the committee agreed to hold off from resigning until the government responded to the guidelines being drawn up by scientists. A major point of contention in the revised guidelines concerns a requirement that ministers and their advisers \"should not act to undermine mutual trust\", a phrase some scientists believe could pressurise scientists into adjusting their advice to match ministers' views. In her resignation letter, Taylor wrote: \"The government's first response [to the guidelines] was highly unsatisfactory and appeared to justify ministers appointing and dismissing independent scientific advisers according to trust, which is an arbitrary and subjective matter.\" Senior scientists, expert advisers and the cross-party science and technology select committee all raised objections with the government during its consultation on the guidelines. Taylor's letter goes on to state that she is \"surprised and dismayed\" that the government rejected the concerns. On the point of resigning, she added: \"I feel that there is little more we can do to describe the importance of ensuring that advice is not subjected to a desire to please ministers or the mood of the day's press.\" Nutt, who now chairs the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs, said he was not surprised to hear of Taylor's resignation. \"I am very concerned that too many scientists have been left in the position of having to decide between advising government and maintaining their scientific independence,\" he told the Guardian. \"I established the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs because I felt it was vital to develop scientific knowledge on drugs independent of the perception or reality of political interference. The new guidelines on scientific advice suggest to me that the government has still not understood the matters of scientific principle at stake, nor what it means to work respectfully with independent scientific advisers.\" Evan Harris, the Liberal Democrat science spokesman, said: \"Before the government criminalises thousands of people by banning a drug, they must take advice on drug harm and other matters from a legally constituted advisory council.\" \"The government have shot themselves in the foot. They were warned repeatedly by me and major scientific organisations that unless they pledged to allow their unpaid independent scientists the freedom and independence to give their advice without fear of reprisal by politicians they would face more resignations. Scientists are simply not prepared to be treated like Professor David Nutt was.\" \"If it is necessary to act urgently to ban mephedrone then, by provoking this resignation by their refusal to respect the scientists who offer advice, the home secretary will now be forced to wait a delay while the council is properly constituted. This episodes tells us is what we should have learned from the BSE disaster: if we treat scientists badly, then the government won't get good advice and everyone suffers.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
