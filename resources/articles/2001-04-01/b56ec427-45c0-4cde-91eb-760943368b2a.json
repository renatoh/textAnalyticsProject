Although less well-off people may not shed tears on your behalf, you do have a fair gripe. Many employees are considering taking out a stakeholder pension rather than making Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) through their company scheme. This is because when they come to retire, they can take a quarter of their stakeholder fund in the form of tax-free cash - but there is no tax-free cash from an AVC plan, which must be used to purchase an annuity. In fact, some people in this situation will still be able to take out a stakeholder. To do this, they need to have some self-employed income which will meet the Inland Revenue's definition of a trade under Schedule D. The Revenue confirms that even 'if the employee has Schedule D income of only \u00a31, they can make contributions up to the earnings threshold, of \u00a33,600 (less tax relief of 22 per cent)'. This fits in with the basic stakeholder design, which allows people with no earnings to set up a plan. The limitation for people in this situation is the earnings cap - currently \u00a395,400. This means that your total pension contributions would be limited to a certain percentage of your earnings up to this threshold. The percentage depends on your age and ranges between 17.5 and 40 per cent. Tom McPhail of independent financial adviser Torquil Clark thinks this route will prove useful to many senior managers who have the spare cash to make use of it. But he warns: 'Make sure you can reasonably enter your self-employed income on your tax return.' He suggests that even if Mrs Bloggs picks strawberries one day and her husband cleans the neighbour's car a couple of times, this could count for self-employed income. However, asked about this, the Revenue replied: 'Mrs Bloggs picking strawberries and Mr Bloggs washing cars twice a year would not amount to a trade. To be classified as a trader, a person must usually be involved in a series of transactions occurring in not-too-great intervals of time and showing habitual and continuous activity.' So, to avoid disputes, you may want to ensure that your strawberry picking is frequent and regular, your car- cleaning really is a business, or your freelance lecturing is a sustained activity. 'Documentary evidence is very useful - keep all your receipts and invoices,' says McPhail. Higher-rate taxpayers do particularly well out of the stakeholder. They will get 40 per cent relief on the maximum gross contribution in a year of \u00a33,600. Although they will have to claim some of the relief back through their tax return, a \u00a33,600 contribution will cost them just \u00a32,160. (This assumes, they have enough earnings to give them 40 per cent relief on all the \u00a33,600. Someone who is just above the 40 per cent threshold of \u00a333,935 will get 40 per cent relief on contributions above the threshold and 22 per cent below.) Ian Johnson, of accountant Grant Thornton, thinks this approach to the stakeholder pension is fine for a higher-rate taxpayer - but that basic-rate taxpayers who are already paying into an occupational scheme may not want to invest so much in pension planning. 'You may be better off putting the money into an Individual Savings Account because it is more accessible,' he says. The earliest that people can usually withdraw money from a pension plan is at 50, but money can be taken from Isas at any time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
