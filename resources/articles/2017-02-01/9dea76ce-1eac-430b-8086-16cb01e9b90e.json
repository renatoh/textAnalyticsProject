Job done for Arsenal, who of course now have another non-league team to cope with - probably a rather more organised one, in Lincoln. Cheers for reading/writing in. Well, that was all relatively uneventful in the end. Arsenal did enough, but not much more than that, but aside from that Roarie Deacon shot Sutton didn\u2019t create much. It\u2019s interesting how different the approaches were from Lincoln and Sutton: the former had a proper plan, did superbly and won against a Premier League team, the latter seemed to treat the whole thing as a bit of a laugh and were just happy to be there. Perhaps that\u2019s unfair, but for all they\u2019re being patronised about what an effort they made, they didn\u2019t really make things especially uncomfortable for Arsenal. An incredible, magnificent, implausible effort to get this far, but could they have done better? Peeeeeeeeeeeeep. 90 mins + 1: Oh, the pie thing was a tie-in with that Bad Newspaper betting firm. Awful stuff. 90 mins: All winding down a bit now. Did we mention that the Sutton reserve goalie was eating a pie on the touchline? What days we live in. 88 mins: Walcott runs at Collins, but it\u2019s a long way around him, and the Arsenal man can\u2019t quite last the distance. 87 mins: Sutton have a corner, which is tossed into the box but is headed clear. Downer goes to ground with what looks like a vicious bout of cramp, and he\u2019ll need to take a moment. 85 mins: A few theories submitted, re: why bring on Sanchez... \u201cClearly Arsene wants Sanchez to get hacked down and injured for 3-6 months. This will put off the various suitors and ensure Sanchez signs another contract with Arsenal. It\u2019s tactical see - Arsene knows !\u201d - Neil Bailey. \u201cPerhaps Sanchez wants/needs the appearance money as he has his dogs to feed, or it might be his last FA Cup tie given Arsenal\u2019s ability to self-implode when the going gets a tiny bit tough\u201d - Mark Judd. \u201cHe\u2019s being sent out there for the same reason that Premier League sides send out their star players for the last 20 minutes on an overseas pre-season tour \u2013 i.e. pleasing the crowds\u201d - PA. 84 mins: Referee Michael Oliver patronises Sutton by not booking Collins, after he pushed Sanchez to the ground. 81 mins: Final change for Sutton, as Dan Fitchett replaces Biamou. 80 mins: Nice work by Sanchez, driving towards the box then feeding Oxlade-Chamberlain, who curls a low shot through a crowd of legs, but keeper Worner saves, diving to his left. The ball then breaks back to Sanchez, who creates some space and tries a chip from the right side of the box, but it goes wide. 77 mins: Oxlade-Chamberlain has to apologise to his colleagues after very nearly stitching them right up after carelessly being dispossessed, but Holding clears up his mess. 76 mins: Can anyone talk me through the thinking behind risking Sanchez here? Is he like a shark, stops going unless he\u2019s playing football? Well, for the shark it would be swimming, but you get the point. 75 mins: 73 mins: And now Arsenal make two changes. Off are Reine-Adelaide and Iwobi, and on come Ashley Maitland-Niles and - for reasons passing understanding - Alexis Sanchez. 71 mins: Another switch for Sutton - Bradley Hudson-Odoi comes on for May. 70 mins: Spence nearly sets up something special straight away, getting down the right and booming a big cross to the back post, but that time Ospina does reasonably well to punch it clear. 69 mins: Change for Sutton - Beckwith is off, replaced by Dan Spence. 68 mins: Oxlade-Chamberlain does brilliantly to dance away from a couple of Sutton defenders, down the left and crosses...but it\u2019s too far in front of Walcott, who was lurking in the six-yard box. 65 mins: WOOF! Good lord, what a hit that was from Deacon! He lined the shot up from about 25 yards out, struck it like a Norse god, and it swerved and flew right against the bar. Ospina barely moved - an inch or two lower and that would\u2019ve been an incredible goal. 63 mins: Close to a third for Arsenal, as Lucas scampers down the left, puts in a low cross but Amankwaah does well to get there just ahead of Walcott, who would\u2019ve had a virtually open goal. 60 mins: Sutton looking a bit lively now. Deacon gets down the left, he throws in plenty of lollipops, crosses to the back stick but Monreal is there to head behind. From the corner, again taken by Deacon, Ospina makes a dreadful attempt at trying to claim the ball and Collins gets a relatively free header, but puts it over. He sits on the astroturf for a short while and contemplates things: that was a huge chance. 57 mins: A shot on target for Sutton: Gomis feeds May in the box, he squares to Biamou who shoots low, but in the end a relatively simple save for Ospina. 56 mins: \u201cI don\u2019t know how this match will end,\u201d writes Peter Oh, \u201cbut one thing is for sure. The Arsenal kit man is going to be left cursing like a pirate at the mounds of rubber pellets that he\u2019ll find stuck to the Gunners\u2019 socks, boots, and shorts.\u201d 55 mins: Nicely worked goal as Perez, Iwobi and Oxlade-Chamberlain exchange passes on the left side of the box, the cross finds its way to Walcott at the back stick and it\u2019s an easy finish to wrap up the game and score his 100th goal for Arsenal. And that\u2019ll probably be that. 52 mins: Wonderful work by Gomis, firstly by very fairly bullying Monreal off the ball, and then with some terrific footwork in the box to create some space, but ultimately his shot is fairly weak and is blocked. 51 mins: Oxlade-Chamberlain tries another of those defence-splitters for Walcott, but misjudges it slightly and it dribbles through to the keeper rather than to the forward. 49 mins: Oxlade-Chamberlain has played a couple of neat passes in his brief time on the pitch so far. There\u2019s one, to play in Walcott, that is wasted a little after it\u2019s laid off to Iwobi. 47 mins: A long ball is pumped forwards and Biamou chases with Holding, who has to play what we\u2019ll call a \u2018spicy\u2019 backpass to Ospina, but he deals with it relatively well. 46 mins: And we\u2019re away for the second half. Change for Arsenal at the break - Oxlade-Chamberlain is on, in place of Elneny, who clearly wasn\u2019t happy after that injury he sustained in the first half. The BBC have somehow persuaded Alan Pardew to get in front of the camera and be interviewed. What a task that must\u2019ve been. Well, Sutton will probably be relatively content with only being 1-0 down, but to be honest they haven\u2019t done a great deal. Of course one can\u2019t expect them to contend with Arsenal too much, but they haven\u2019t really looked in much danger. Still, they\u2019re in touch, and haven\u2019t done too badly. Peeeeeeeeeeeep. 45 mins: After being in virtually no danger for the whole game thus far, Ospina tries to create some of that by passing the ball straight to May just outside the area. The Sutton man takes it into the box, but his shot can only find the side-netting. Big chance. Naturally, Ospina shouts at his colleagues for not anticipating that he was going to give the thing directly to an opposition player. 43 mins: Rough foul from behind on Walcott by Amankwaah. Should\u2019ve been a booking, that. 41 mins: Deacon puts the free-kick to the back post, but Arsenal clear and counter. Walcott gets the ball caught under his feet a bit, Iwobi also doesn\u2019t really get the ball under control but it breaks back to him and he shoots, but it\u2019s deflected wide. 40 mins: Arsenal get a corner, but after a bit of head tennis in the area Sutton counter. Deacon manages to get the ball off Reine-Adelaide, but the Arsenal youngster\u2019s iffy night continues as he gets a booking for pulling his opponent down about 35 yards out on the left. 37 mins: Sutton get another free-kick about 40 yards out on the right, but once again their cross is overhit. They seem to be, understandably, keen to test Arsenal in the air, but they either seem to be misjudging the wind or are a little giddy, the sort of tension in their legs that snooker commentators attribute ropey shots to. 36 mins: 34 mins: Collins goes right through Iwobi with one of those \u2018hearty\u2019 challenges that if it was in the Premier League, the commentators would call it a disgrace, but as it\u2019s a little non-league team and bless them they\u2019re trying, there was a little chuckle in the voice. Iwobi gets a kick on the shin, and was lucky to get away with only that. Not even a free-kick given. 33 mins: Elneny gets a little attention, but could be OK. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Ashley Maitland-Niles are warming up just in case, though. 31 mins: Sutton have half an attack, but it fizzles out with another overhit ball. There\u2019s been plenty of those. Meanwhile, Elneny is down with some sort of non-specific malady, and needs treatment. 29 mins: Bit of a shame that - Sutton had just been building some sort of momentum. Walcott finds some space about 40 yards out, he drives towards the box and shoots with power, but not quite the right direction and it goes over. 27 mins: Sutton attack and leave a fair bit of space down their left flank, into which Lucas Perez runs. He then cuts in, crosses low into the box toward Walcott who tries to flick it, but no matter: Walcott\u2019s presence possibly distracted the Sutton keeper Worner, and it creeps in at the far post. A little from nowhere, that. 25 mins: \u201cI know that most neutrals are hoping for a win for Sutton here,\u201d writes David Wall, \u201cbut isn\u2019t there at least something to be said for being secretly pleased if Arsenal do make it through? The idea of seeing the Arsenal defence trying to cope with Lincoln\u2019s Matt Rhead in the next round is surely too good a prospect to want to miss.\u201d 24 mins: Who had 24 minutes in the \u2018When will Xhaka be booked?\u2019 sweep? If so, claim your prize: the walking yellow card is cautioned for stupidly, pointlessly, cynically pulling Eastmond back. 22 mins: Deacon, one of the livelier Sutton players, does a couple of lollipops to get past Gabriel on the right side of the box, but his left-footed cross is badly overhit. 21 mins: Marauding full-back Gabriel gets down the right, but his cross is deflected and loops into the area, and it was a fairly easy take for keeper Worner. Alan \u2018Pards\u2019 Pardew is in the crowd. The BBC commentator rather kindly called his current phase of life as a \u2018sabbatical\u2019. 19 mins: Reine-Adelaide not having the best time of it so far: he clumsily barges May over, at the second attempt, and concedes a free-kick in the Arsenal half. 17 mins: Eastmond challenges Monreal for the ball and tumbles in the box, but there\u2019s no penalty given. And quite right too: let\u2019s just say if that was Ashley Young who went down under little encouragement, you\u2019d be hearing much more about it. 15 mins: Arsenal find some space in the Sutton defence, and Reine-Adelaide finds himself on the byline on the right, and for some reason chooses to shoot rather than pick out one of many men in the middle. The ball then breaks to Elneny who hoys the shot well, well, well over. 13 mins: Not a great deal of note has happened thus far, Both teams just feeling each other out for the moment. Incidental observation: all the Sutton coaching staff look like they\u2019ve got some lovely nice new trackies for the occasion. 12 mins: \u201cThe pitch looks like it\u2019s made from the same velour as a teenage girls\u2019 tracksuit,\u201d writes David Penney. I\u2019ll avoid asking the obvious question. 10 mins: Quite a few of these Arsenal players seem to be wearing proper football boots. As a regular five-a-sider, I can confirm they are the absolute worst. Or is that just me? Is it considered universal poor form not to wear astros on non-grass surfaces? 7 mins: Walcott breaks towards the area but is halted, and the ball falls to Reine-Adelaide, but his shot is blocked. It goes out to Downer, but Monreal barges him over and Sutton have a free-kick in their right-back region. 6 mins: Sutton have their first attack...after a fashion. A long throw is directed towards the big man Collins (there are, it must be said, one or two big men in their team), but the flick-on went nowhere. 5 mins: \u201cDid I read that right?\u201d exclaims Glenn Easton. \u201cWalcott had nothing to give his opposite number to mark the match? What\u2019s the bad karma coefficient for that faux pas?\u201d Maybe he just forgot. 3 mins: Eastmond goes in reasonably hard on Elneny, but takes the ball cleanly enough. The Arsenal man isn\u2019t happy, but if he\u2019s going to kvetch about challenges like that, this early, he could be in for a long night. 1 min: Arsenal knock the thing around for the entire first minute, possibly trying to get used to the pitch, possibly because the Sutton players just couldn\u2019t get it off them... We\u2019re about to get underway. Arsenal will kick off... Sutton captain Jamie Collins gives Arsenal skipper Theo Walcott (!) a pennant. Walcott gives Collins...nothing. The players are out. Sutton manager Paul Doswell is, to say the least, lapping all of this up, touring the pitch and waving to the crowd. Arsene Wenger looks tired. \u201cWe can only repair what happened against Bayern, against Bayern,\u201d he says when asked if this game can be some sort of redemption for what happened in Munich. The Beeb\u2019s Dan Walker then asked him about the pitch. \u201cTop level sport is about adapting to the pitch,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least it\u2019s flat.\u201d Here\u2019s Roger Anderson with an answer on Mertesacker: \u201cI believe Wenger touched on why Mertsacker is not playing tonight: the artificial turf would not be a good surface as the first game back from injury.\u201d It\u2019ll be a crime if this isn\u2019t the case... Worth recalling that Sutton midfielder Nicky Bailey is probably just leaving the drive-thru. My diet has got me to where I am today! I am not the best eater. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a salad in my life, or a vegetable. It\u2019s always worked for me. My pre-match meal is always a McDonald\u2019s \u2013 nine nuggets. When I was younger, my mum used to try and make me eat the green stuff, but I used to sick it up.\u201d Nine nuggets, mind you. You\u2019re tempted to wonder when, if not in this game, is Per Mertesacker going to start. He was back in full training nearly a month ago, so unless he\u2019s had a setback (not out of the question with an Arsenal player) then it\u2019s surprising he\u2019s not there to provide a little experience and whatnot. Here\u2019s today\u2019s Fiver, written by a handsome, kind, generous and witty young man. Features a bit of Sutton. And Arsenal. Sutton United Worner, Amankwaah, Downer, Collins, Beckwith, Deacon, Bailey, Eastmond, May, Gomis, Biamou. Subs: John, Hudson-Odoi, Fitchett, Spence, Monakana, Tubbs, Shaw. Arsenal Ospina; Gabriel, Mustafi, Holding, Monreal; Elneny, Xhaka; Lucas, Reine-Adelaide, Iwobi; Walcott. Subs: Martinez, Debuchy, Mertesacker, Gibbs, Maitland-Niles, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Sanchez. Referee: Michael Oliver LIVE! LIVE! LIVE! You\u2019ll remember that Sutton did pretty well back in 1989, but you might not know what happened next. Steven Pye, as part of the Guardian Sport Network, plays the role of Craig David by filling you in. There\u2019s a lot to this game. A lot to talk about. There\u2019s so much to talk about, so much for people to get giddy and talk about, there almost no point in actually playing the game. In fact, why bother playing the game? This can be the first FA Cup tie decided by narrative. All the storylines are here. We\u2019ve got the basic the MINNOWS against the GIANTS (which in itself is a weird thing: a small fish vs a James Dean film), which is enough to be going on with; there\u2019s the astroturf, or whatever they\u2019re calling non-grass pitches these days; there\u2019s the former Arsenal player turning out for Sutton; there\u2019s that fat goalie bloke; there\u2019s Sutton\u2019s past; there\u2019s Arsenal going through an existential crisis; there\u2019s Lincoln doing Burnley over. There\u2019s loads! It\u2019s preferable not to be too \u2018magic of the FA Cup\u2019 about the FA Cup, but this is proper, old-fashioned stuff. Your shiny, expensive, theoretically good team against one where the boiler is knackered so they can\u2019t have hot showers. And wouldn\u2019t it be something if Sutton won? As the winners of this one will face Lincoln, we\u2019d be guaranteed a non-league team in the semi-finals of the FA Cup. The semi-finals! Hoo-boy. It\u2019s also weird inasmuch as most of the time your average neutral wants the underdog to do well, but in this case Sutton have rather made a mess of their goodwill by signing up with The Bad Newspaper. Plus, at this stage, surely most with some small sense of human empathy want Arsene Wenger to do as well as possible for the next few months. It\u2019s the end, everyone seems to know it\u2019s the end, so surely we all want this man, this Arsenal legend who basically built a football club, to go out with some dignity. Or, y\u2019know, maybe you don\u2019t. Whatever you\u2019re after, it\u2019ll all be here. Kick-off: 19.55 GMT"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
