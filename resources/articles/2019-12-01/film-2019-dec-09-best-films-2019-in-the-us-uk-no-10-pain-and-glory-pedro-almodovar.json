Well, Pedro Almod\u00f3var is one of the select few who can actually make this happen. While Pain and Glory isn\u2019t exactly an autobiography, it may as well be: Banderas plays a gay Spanish film director with bushy grey hair who lives in a flat that, apparently, is a replica of Almod\u00f3var\u2019s own; the fact that he\u2019s called Salvador and not Pedro is only the tiniest of fig leaves. Salvador is an introspective individual confronting the dying of the light. He\u2019s not exactly raging, more moaning quietly in despair. His back hurts, his headaches are getting worse and he has a mysterious choking ailment that nothing seems to fix. More significantly, he is embarking on a reckoning with his past triggered by the plans a film archive has to restore and rerelease one of his early films. (This film is called Sabor, or Flavour, and we get to see its sleazy poster image of a blood-red lipsticked mouth with a tongue reshaped as a strawberry.) Salvador has fallen out with the lead actor, Alberto (Asier Etxeandia), but it\u2019s his decision to try and reconnect, to get Alberto along for the dreaded audience Q&amp;A, that triggers Salvador\u2019s act of mental archaeology. This is the simple prop Almod\u00f3var uses as an excuse to submerge himself into a warm bath of reverie and reflection. Mixing memory and desire, he reaches back into Salvador\u2019s childhood, to excavate his intense affection for his mother (played by Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, equal parts glamour and graft) as well the the first stirrings of sexual desire \u2013 for an illiterate village labourer he teaches to read and write. There is a moving encounter with a former lover \u2013 now married with kids \u2013 and an equally moving later encounter with his dying mother, who he feels he badly let down at the last. In another film-maker\u2019s hands this could all be absurdly self-indulgent \u2013 particularly when Salvador starts agonising about his creative problems \u2013 but Almod\u00f3var\u2019s approach is so nakedly direct that the sequence of often bizarre coincidences don\u2019t seem to matter at all. (I mean, what are the chances that, when you walk into a random art exhibition, the first picture you see is the scrap-paper drawing of you that your hunky crush did 60 years earlier?) There\u2019s an underlying seriousness to it all, despite the bits of narrative tricksiness, that puts Pain and Glory at the opposite end of the spectrum to the high-pitch camp that distinguished his earlier films. Banderas is in fact the real-life model for Alberto. He and Almod\u00f3var had a parting of the ways after 1990\u2019s Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!, before reuniting for The Skin I Live In in 2011. His participation here is not \u201cdelicious\u201d, or an audience-wink; it just adds another layer to Almod\u00f3var\u2019s sombre reflections. One thing I do find genuinely hilarious though: the matter of fact way that, encouraged by Alberto, Salvador casually returns to his heroin habit, cooking up lugubriously as others might make themselves a herbal tea. (Did Banderas and Almod\u00f3var do this for real? That is not entirely clear.) I do have to confess, I haven\u2019t been a major admirer of Almod\u00f3var\u2019s recent work: the knotty, pseudo-Hitchcockian thrillers he persisted with in the 2000s and 10s seem to be to be oddly underpowered compared to the blazing energy of his 1980s and early 90s films, while the straight comedies just seem mannered. Previously, the last film of his I really liked was Live Flesh, way back in 1997. But Pain and Glory changes all that: it is a truly great work that may mark a new phase in Almod\u00f3var\u2019s development. Long may it continue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
