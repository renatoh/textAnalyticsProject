It\u2019s a film that tells you what you already knew \u2013 and then made a conscious or unconscious decision to forget, if you are a meat-eater. Factory farming is a horrible business. The economics demand ever greater productivity under conditions of ever greater squalor and cruelty for the animals themselves: the normalisation of what is grimly known as \u201cconfinement agriculture\u201d. Chicken nuggets are the product of something pretty horrendous. Small farmers who are contracted by the big corporations to provide meat product are themselves treated as serfs, the upper homo sapiens layer of degradation. Whistleblowers pay a terrible price for informing the public about what is going on, in terms of harassment and unemployment; journalists and reporters are harassed, too. Yet the film ends, as so many documentaries of this sort end, on a note of optimism, a series of relatively upbeat bulletins in white-on-black intertitles: campaigners are having sporadic successes; plant-based protein companies and small organic farmers aren\u2019t doing so very badly. But to what conclusion is the film\u2019s logic pointing us? It can only be to stop eating meat and dairy products \u2013 like quitting cigarettes \u2013 although the film is chary about saying this too clearly or too hectoringly, maybe for fear of alienating its own customer base. The film is about what William Burroughs called the \u201cfrozen moment when everyone sees what is at the end of every fork\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
