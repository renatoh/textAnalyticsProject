Masterpiece of the week Apollo and Daphne, by Piero del Pollaiuolo (probably 1470-80) The ancient Roman poet Ovid tells in his Metamorphoses how the god Apollo fell in love with the nymph Daphne \u2013 but she was repelled by him. She ran away until she could run no more, then prayed to be rescued. Pollaiuolo shows what happened next. Daphne is being transformed into a laurel tree. Her arms have already become leafy branches. Soon she will no longer be recognisable. Pollaiuolo gives Daphne\u2019s metamorphosis a physical exactitude as he imagines what it would really be like to see flesh change into wood. This is one of the very earliest Renaissance attempts to revive classical mythology. It set a challenge many more artists would take up: to make the strange transformations of myth look real, from Botticelli\u2019s fauns, to Bernini\u2019s much more sensual Apollo and Daphne, to Picasso\u2019s minotaur. \u2022 National Gallery, London. Image of the week Portrait of Auguste Rodin, artist unknown An eagle-eyed visitor to Madrid\u2019s eclectic L\u00e1zaro Galdiano Museum was intrigued to find a painting of his favourite French sculptor in the collection \u2013 although the caption said it was a portrait of the King Leopold II of Belgium. A spot of detective work at home confirmed the hunch of the visitor, graphic designer Luis Pastor, and he shared his research with the museum. Happily, its curators were delighted with the fresh attribution and have congratulated Pastor on his efforts. Read more about it.
