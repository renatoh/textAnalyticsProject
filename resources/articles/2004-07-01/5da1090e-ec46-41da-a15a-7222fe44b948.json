When the device inevitably erupts at a hushed moment, audience members can do little more than give impotent frowns and the occasional 'shhhh!' All this could be about to change, however, with a technology that enables entire rooms to be sealed off from mobile phone signals, ensuring that they will never disturb the peace again. The phone slayer, however, will be a model of discretion and blend into the background: it is wallpaper. British scientists have found a way to mass-produce frequency-selective 'wallpaper' screens (FSS) on a large scale for the first time. The screens are metal grids designed in an intricate pattern which filter out some radio signals and allow others through, depending on their wavelength. They can be fitted to walls and covered with real wallpaper so they disappear from view. The breakthrough was made by QinetiQ, which was part of the Ministry of Defence before it was privatised and which believes the special wallpaper could benefit airports, hospitals, schools and any building requiring a 'quiet zone'. A technology which has its origins in stealth aircraft and boats could even become an ingredient of home decorating. But, according to QinetiQ, it could also have a more serious role in the fight against terrorism. 'Phones can not only be disruptive but on occasions pose a real security threat as they could be used to set off a device,' said Michael Burns, director of aviation markets at QinetiQ. 'The wallpaper allows certain wavelengths to pass through them while preventing others, so that mobile phone or WiFi signals are effectively blocked out, but two-way radio and other similar systems are totally unaffected. 'Until now it's only been practical to manufacture small areas of frequency-selective screens, so they have been predominantly used as the protective screening for microwave oven doors or in various radar applications. With our process, it's now both practical and economic to produce large sheets of the material.' Typical areas that could be screened within an airport include the arrival halls or explosive containment areas, where suspicious packages are held awaiting investigation, meaning that a mobile phone could not be used to trigger a device. The wallpaper is produced by printing the grid pattern on to the surface to be screened. Metal is then 'grown' in the desired pattern when the wallpaper is immersed in a chemical bath. Only one potential problem remains: how to stop signals rushing in when someone opens a door."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
