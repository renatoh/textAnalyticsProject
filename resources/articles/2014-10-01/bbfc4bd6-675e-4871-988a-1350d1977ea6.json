However, his meticulous approach proves to be an advantage rather than an oxymoron. A hefty sample of Art of Noise\u2019s Moments in Love on With You signals Bainbridge\u2019s aim to combine soulful sensuality with artful experimentation; with the aid of some delicate playing from jazz sessioneers Finn Peters and Sam Beste he duly pulls it off. This really is a beautifully crafted album, its sincere homages to Jam &amp; Lewis\u2019s crisp R&amp;B or Womack &amp; Womack\u2019s swish club soul transformed by a distinctly English kind of longing. Bainbridge remains a slightly aloof presence throughout, but zesty vocal cameos from Kelela, Robyn, Tawiah and Ghanaian rapper M.anifest save Otherness from slipping into tasteful self-indulgence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
