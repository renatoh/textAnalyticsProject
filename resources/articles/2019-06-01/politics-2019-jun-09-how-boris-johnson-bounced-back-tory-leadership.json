The MP was honest with the former foreign secretary during their 30-minute chat. \u201cI said to him: \u2018I\u2019m not going to commit to anyone yet. I have rubbished you and trashed you in emails to constituents. I\u2019ve been quite rude about you in interviews about the way you behaved in Brexit votes.\u2019 I said to him: \u2018One problem is you\u2019re a receptacle for every wack job and loon in the Tory party.\u2019 He took it quite well.\u201d The meeting was revealing, not so much for what Johnson said in an attempt to win over the MP, but for the fact that he had found time to have a lengthy meeting with a sceptical colleague. Despite it all, the MP conceded to Johnson that he now faced a dilemma: \u201cI find myself sitting here thinking I might very well vote for you.\u201d Johnson\u2019s previous tilt at the top job in 2016, brought to a disastrous end by Michael Gove\u2019s decision to run against him, was marked by chaos and calamity. Even the decision to pull out, he now concedes to allies, was an error. Johnson is understood to have apologised since to supporters who begged him not to throw in the towel. His time as foreign secretary was punctuated by gaffes and saw him largely written off as a future prime minister. Yet Johnson has not only managed to re-emerge as the frontrunner to replace May: he has done what some thought impossible, conducting a disciplined, strategic and (so far) relatively error-free campaign that has seen him build more support among MPs than any other candidate. So what has changed? In interviews with the Observer, several people who have been close to Johnson since 2016 and MPs who have observed his latest bid for No 10 described a campaign that had been long in the planning, with a larger and more cohesive team and a candidate willing to follow orders and put in the hours. Several said there was a sense from Johnson that he knew he was fortunate to have another chance. \u201cBoris is a figure who defies political rules \u2013 and the fact he has another chance is just another example of that,\u201d said one. Johnson still has key lieutenants from his 2016 leadership bid, notably MPs Jake Berry and Nigel Adams, who remain close at hand. He also speaks to Lynton Crosby, the political strategist who masterminded his London mayoral wins, every day \u2013 but as a friend, rather than formal adviser. Yet it is the new arrivals since 2016 that appear to have helped steady the ship. In a race that is all about winning support from Tory MPs, parliamentary expertise has been drafted in. James Wharton, a former MP popular among colleagues, was recommended as a figure who could boost Johnson\u2019s once dismal reputation among his fellow Tories. Gavin Williamson\u2019s sacking as defence secretary by May also meant there was a former chief whip on the market. Johnson\u2019s special adviser Lee Cain has been charged with the unenviable task of limiting his boss\u2019s newsworthy outbursts and has recently been given reinforcements. The next element was understanding how Johnson could go about changing the minds of enough colleagues to secure a place in the run-off between two contenders, who will face a vote of Conservative members in July. Here, they had a stroke of luck. After finding himself on the backbenches under May, Grant Shapps, the former party chairman, found the time to read the multi-volume biography of former US president Lyndon Johnson by Robert Caro. Apart from gaining a detailed knowledge of Texan hill farming, it gave Shapps an interest in Johnson\u2019s first rule of politics \u2013 you have to be able to count. From the backbenches, Shapps decided to test his skills \u2013 building a spreadsheet of MPs and attempting to predict how each would vote in the no-confidence motions and meaningful Brexit votes. His results were close to the mark. He then used the same system to map the leadership election, looking at how the electorate of 313 Tory MPs would break down. It led to the creation of \u201cthe spreadsheet\u201d \u2013 a detailed account of where MPs stand and how winnable they are. Persuaded that the Johnson campaign was serious, Shapps joined the crew and his data has been used to put MPs in different groups, with \u201cpivot tables\u201d used to show what kind of campaigning each should be subjected to \u2013 and which are a lost cause. It has helped the team direct their efforts \u2013 and seen Johnson complete as many as 16 appointments with colleagues a day. Breakfasts. Coffees. Lunches. On Monday night, his team had even moved on to assembling a dinner that included some MPs who were already publicly backing another candidate. Few have been safe from the Johnson charm offensive. One MP who backed Johnson early on said: \u201cI said to Boris, \u2018I really like you. I think we do need a change in direction, but frankly I\u2019m not attaching myself to a campaign that was as chaotic as the one in 2016 or frankly, since then. It\u2019s just out of the question.\u2019 I took a gamble on him being true to his word and he has been. He\u2019s been 100% focused.\u201d Many figures were reluctant to speak on the record \u2013 a sign of the discipline at play and the importance attached to \u201cspeaking with one voice\u201d. However, Simon Clarke, a pro-Brexit MP and an early supporter, agreed to give his account of the Johnson revival. He said he was approached by Johnson at the end of last year. \u201cHe is someone who doesn\u2019t treat you as if he is the big cheese and we\u2019re the bloody infantry,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very much a two-way conversation. He was interested in marginal seats in the north that voted Leave \u2013 and how to keep those seats and win others like it. \u201cI think he\u2019s been tempered by the experience of 2016. He is at ease that this is a challenge and that the leadership is a hard fight. The bottom line is we\u2019ve done our homework. We\u2019ve spoken to people, but we\u2019ve genuinely tried to listen as well. We\u2019re not doing the hard sell.\u201d Luck has undoubtedly played a significant part in his campaign. The most obvious factor in his success is the arrival of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party, which has helped to frame the central question in this contest \u2013 namely, who is best equipped to see off that threat from that party. \u201cThe main difference, I suspect, is that the situation is so stark,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cPeople recognise that this is an existential challenge for the Conservative party. All the available polling evidence suggests there is one person with the policies and personal skills to connect to the voters that we have temporarily been sundered from. It\u2019s not a difficult sell to colleagues. People recognise that things have not worked.\u201d Then there are the candidates who take a harder line on Brexit \u2013 most notably Dominic Raab, whose presence has allowed Johnson\u2019s team to paint their man as the person more likely to reach out to Remain voters should Brexit be secured. One figure from the One Nation caucus of moderate Tory MPs explained: \u201cWe have to be asking ourselves, what happens in a Boris vs Raab contest? In that scenario, isn\u2019t it Boris who is the more likely one to compromise? To at least delay no deal so we can manage it? That\u2019s the dilemma.\u201d One pro-Remain MP backing Johnson, who is well aware of all the risks involved in supporting him, was nervous last week as his candidate appeared at a private hustings. \u201cI thought, am I about to look like a complete idiot for supporting this guy? But actually, what we saw was, yes, a bit of humour. But there was also some gravitas there. It was a relief.\u201d Many obstacles lie ahead. With Gove\u2019s campaign disrupted by his admission that he had taken cocaine, Johnson\u2019s own drug use will again come under scrutiny. On the BBC show Have I Got News For You, he said he had been offered cocaine at university, but added a typically Johnsonian get-out clause: \u201cI sneezed so it didn\u2019t go up my nose. In fact, it may have been icing sugar.\u201d Asked later in a GQ interview to clarify whether any had gone up his nose, he replied: \u201cIt must have done, yes, but it didn\u2019t do much for me I can tell you.\u201d He has admitted smoking cannabis. His team will be hoping that this is just another issue from Johnson\u2019s back catalogue of indiscretions that seem to have no bearing on his bulletproof appeal to the membership. But then there is the elephant in the room of this leadership election \u2013 the Johnson Brexit policy. He has vowed to Leave, with or without a deal, at the end of October. Yet even MPs backing him already accept that parliament will use all means available to stop him. The official line from the campaign bunker is that Johnson will reveal all in due course. Supporters are adamant he will not delay Brexit again. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me to answer [how he will ensure Brexit happens by the end of October], but I would say that his commitment to that date is genuine,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cThe message is the same in private as it is in public. I think in a way, the onus will pass to parliament.\u201d One cabinet minister pointed out that not only would parliament stop a no-deal in October, but that the changing of the European commission over the summer would mean Johnson would have no one to agree a new deal with. \u201cThere will be no one in Brussels,\u201d they said. \u201cWould [current lead negotiator] Michel Barnier really have the mandate to agree a new deal, even if he wanted to? It is unlikely.\u201d The big problem for Johnson\u2019s campaign is that, in all probability, he is currently engaged in the easy bit \u2013 winning over Tory MPs and members in circumstances tailor-made for him. However, Opinium polling for the Observer shows the huge doubts harboured by voters as a whole. The pollster tried to measure how voters regarded him by compiling a \u201cnet agreement\u201d figure on a series of personal qualities \u2013 the difference between those who agree he has the quality and those who do not. Voters saw him as determined, returning a net agreement of +28%. That is where the good news ended. He had a net \u201clikable\u201d rating of 0%, -7% for \u201csays what he means\u201d, -13% for competent, -18% for \u201ctrusted to take big decisions\u201d, -26% for \u201ctruthful\u201d and -30% for \u201cstands up for the most vulnerable\u201d. And Johnson\u2019s volatility as a candidate means that some cabinet ministers are advising his opponents to make sure there is a full calendar of members\u2019 hustings throughout July, in the hope that his discipline will fray. \u201cThere must be a chance that he will begin to be challenged,\u201d said one. \u201cThey must go for a full contest.\u201d BORIS\u2019S BLUNDERS September 2012 Apologises for a 2004 Spectator article when he was editor that claimed drunken fans were partly to blame for the Hillsborough tragedy.
