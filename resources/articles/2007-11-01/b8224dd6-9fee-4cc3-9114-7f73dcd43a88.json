Chief executive Chris Bell said these factors contributed to a 5% decline in gross win - the amount lost by punters - on traditional bets in the group's 2,000 UK shops for the four months to the end of October. This disappointing performance was more than offset by \u00a391.8m of net revenue from the group's telephone betting business, after heavy losses by high-rolling punters. Bell was quick to emphasise these were exceptional figures that were unlikely to be repeated consistently. Excluding gains from high rollers and the cost of the group's first television advertising campaign, Ladbrokes profits fell by 12% for the four-month period. Shares in Ladbrokes closed down 35.5p, or just over 9%, at 344p as investors discounted the volatile high-rolling performance. Bell, who has previously emphasised Ladbrokes' international growth prospects, yesterday conceded that the relaxation of rules in overseas markets was taking longer to materialise than expected. Having lost out on opportunities in the far east, he said the international business would contribute about \u00a320m to profits in five years. His previous forecast had been for \u00a320m to \u00a340m in three to five years. In Britain, Bell conceded that operating profit from betting shops was no longer likely - as had been hoped - to return next year to the peaks seen in 2004. Despite the exceptional run of poor results and horse racing cancellations, the longer term trend suggested a tough trading environment. The one bright spot, which helped the UK betting shop business record a 4% rise in gross win, was continued strong performance from touch-screen roulette machines. Takings from the machines in English shops dipped for about six weeks after the ban on smoking in public places was extended south of the border from Scotland in July. They have since recovered and finance director Brian Wallace said he expected the machine take to rise again in the wake of changes introduced when the final stage of the Gambling Act 2005 came into force at the start of September. Changes allow later betting shop opening hours and the addition of new touch-screen games such as blackjack. \"We think machines will do pretty well,\" Wallace said. \"But it is impossible to tell how pretty pretty will be.\" Asked about the decline in horse racing gross win, Bell said: \"UK horse racing is not as relevant to our customer base as it used to be. Customers are much more interested in machines and virtual [racing]. They bet on-demand now rather than spending ages studying form in the Sun in the morning. You have to adapt to that.\" The racing industry should be aware that this would have ramifications for the latest round of negotiations over the bookmaking levy - a charge on horse bets used to fund the race track operators. He said it was \"an anachronistic system, well past its sell-by date\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
