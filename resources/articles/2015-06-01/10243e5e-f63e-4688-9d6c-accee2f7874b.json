The real issue is: how can it be that such a grotesque term as 4x4 is still doing the rounds? There\u2019s never been anything amusing about 4x4. It\u2019s a vile, sexist slur, basically a way of calling a woman (a mother at that) a slag. The woman who probably knows this more than most is Ulrika Jonsson, the most high-profile UK female to have been publicly branded a 4x4. Jonsson has written eloquently, with admirable candour, on the complex way her life and relationships have panned out, for all the good it\u2019s done her. For some, she will always remain the punchline of a sniggering national joke. But why? Are women such as Jonsson and Hamilton supposed to regret their children, apologise for their very existence? Oh the irony, when it\u2019s they who are owed the apology. As well as being nasty, 4x4 doesn\u2019t even make sense. All it says is that a woman procreated with four men \u2013 is this really such a huge number that it blows some tiny minds? You have to wonder what people are specifically objecting to \u2013 the men, the children, the relationships, the sex? Employing these criteria, I\u2019m a 2x2, but for all anyone knows I may have had just as many relationships and just as much sex \u2013 hey, baby, perhaps more! \u2013 than a so-called 4x4. Even though I\u2019m this relatively virtuous-seeming 2x2, what\u2019s to say I haven\u2019t been the biggest slag on the block? If perceived reckless procreation is the problem, where is all the \u201chilarious\u201d coverage on 4x4 men \u2013 after all, it\u2019s far easier for men to father multiple children by multiple partners? If anything, the fact that those women chose to procreate suggests that they sincerely believed that they were in meaningful relationships that would last. If being mistaken about a relationship lasting is a crime, then hang us all. It would make as much moral sense as subscribing to the twisted mindset that a woman having relationships with the huge tally of four men is (just about) acceptable but the woman who chooses to have children with the same men is a pathetic, brain-dead slut. Even if some 4x4 couplings aren\u2019t particularly long term or meaningful (it happens), what business is it of anyone not directly involved in the child\u2019s upbringing or welfare? Once again, we arrive at an ugly truth \u2013 that some people simply can\u2019t accept that a woman\u2019s body, fertility, and life choices are not some bizarre community issue. Instead, they are her own concern. A womb (used or otherwise) ultimately belongs to one person alone. Just as her situation is solely the childless or child-free woman\u2019s business, it\u2019s an entirely personal matter if another woman has children with multiple fathers. Even if you don\u2019t agree, there are the children to consider. How do you think they feel when their mothers are disparaged and their own existence turned into a squalid joke? It must take a very warped personality not to care that these kids might be deeply hurt. Certainly it looks tricky to hang on to the high moral ground when that means insulting and denigrating innocent children. It\u2019s now 2015 and while the grossly misogynistic 4x4 tag was never acceptable, it really is time that it died a quiet death. Jon Snow\u2019s dead. Oh sorry, didn\u2019t anyone tell you? How amusing to witness the reaction to Jon Snow\u2019s death in Game of Thrones mired in shrieks of \u201cspoiler!\u201d as people struggled to discuss the event without actually mentioning it, in case somebody else hadn\u2019t seen it. All this going on, days after it was broadcast, as if sensitive viewer-lambs still had to be protected. Give over. It\u2019s not as though Snow\u2019s death was a secret (it\u2019s in the books). It wasn\u2019t a genuine shocker, like Jimmy Darmody\u2019s death in Boardwalk Empire. Oops, sorry, for that spoiler \u2013 it only happened four years ago. But that\u2019s the tedious overkill of spoiler culture for you \u2013 everyone going into meltdown regardless of time passed: \u201cBut I haven\u2019t watched the box set yet!\u201d Bring back appointment or commitment TV where you showed up to watch something on the night, or at least within the same week. Not giving away previews is one thing, but how devoted can a viewer be if they\u2019re still moaning about spoilers days after a hit show has aired? Here\u2019s a thought: if you\u2019re such a fan, then watch it within a reasonable timeframe, and, if you don\u2019t, that\u2019s your own lookout. Deal? Othello\u2026 it\u2019s not really a grey area Steven Berkoff has taken umbrage at a theatre review that observed that white actors no longer blacked-up for Othello. Railing against \u201cfiends of political correctness\u201d, Berkoff described Laurence Olivier\u2019s blacked-up performance of Othello in 1964 as \u201cspellbinding\u201d saying how such performances are more than \u201ca bit of shoe polish on your chops\u201d. In some ways, you can appreciate where Berkoff is coming from when he says: \u201cGreat drama is colour blind.\u201d Certainly, white actors playing Othello was never equivalent to blacking-up for, say, an edition of The Black and White Minstrel show. However, this is missing the main point, which is that black actors have only lately been \u201cpermitted\u201d to play a plum part such as Othello \u2013 and black actors finally (and exclusively) playing this role is partly an overdue reaction to longstanding racism, covert and otherwise, in the arts. There\u2019s a culture where British black performers are still generally disregarded to the point where many of them feel they have to relocate to the US to further their careers. The fact that black performers used to be overlooked even for roles such as Othello (where the character is supposed to be black) is both risible and offensive. While certain white actors may have played the part brilliantly, what about all the black actors of the past who never got the chance? In this way, it\u2019s not really about much-maligned political correctness; it\u2019s about trying to correct a longstanding absurdity. Instead of asking: \u201cWhy is it wrong for white actors to black-up and play Othello?\u201d it becomes: \u201cWhat\u2019s so offensive about there being a major Shakespearean role that is purely for black actors?\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s not only about finding the right answers, it\u2019s about asking the right questions too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
