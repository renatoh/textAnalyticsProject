We have to do something.\" Giffords didn't speak to Vogue, letting the camera do the work for her. But the magazine feature underlines her growing role as the figurehead of the movement for greater gun controls. Giffords, who was shot in the head in 2011 as she convened a street political rally, is captured at home in Tucson, Arizona, with Kelly. She is seen relaxing on a leather sofa, and in the company of her other faithful companion: her dog Nelson. Her extraordinary story, from the tragedy that left her injured and killed six people to gradual rehabilitation, has horrified and inspired America in equal measure. She is rapidly developing into a formidable force in the billowing debate over gun violence that followed December's Connecticut school shooting. On Tuesday she attended the annual state of the union address in Washington. Last month she delivered a short but memorable speech to a US senate hearing on gun violence. She has formalised her campaigning around guns by forming with Kelly a new organisation called Americans for Responsible Solutions, a direct counterpoint to the aggressive gun rights lobby group the NRA, that has just released its first TV ad. The mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, who has led the call for greater gun controls for many years, told Vogue that Giffords inspired him. \"As a survivor, a gun owner, a defender of the second amendment, and a former member of Congress, she has a unique voice on this issue,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
