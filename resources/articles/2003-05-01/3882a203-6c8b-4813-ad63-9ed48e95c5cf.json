The blast, which went off at 5:14pm (1414 GMT), was the fifth bombing in two days. The suspected attacker - who the area police chief said he believed to be a woman - detonated her device near a queue of people who were waiting to be security checked before entering the building. There were reports that security guards prevented her entrance into the Shaarei Amakim mall, preventing the death toll from being higher. The militant groups Islamic Jihad and al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades both claimed responsibilty for the attack, which followed four bombings by Hamas militants over the weekend, including a Jerusalem bus attack that killed seven Israelis. In a telephone interview with the Associated Press, an Islamic Jihad leader in the West Bank town of Jenin claimed responsibility for the attack. Later, the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades claimed responsibility, saying it had video footage of the bomber, whom it identified as a woman, Heba Daraghmeh, 19, from the West Bank village of Tubas. The Palestinian Authority condemned the bombing. \"We reject [suicide attacks] because they harm us politically and morally and don't represent the Palestinian position,\" said labour minister Ghassan Khatib. In response to the spate of bombings, Israel threatened to boycott foreign envoys who meet with Yasser Arafat. Israel holds the Palestinian leader responsible for the latest violence, even though most attacks were carried out by Islamic militants. \"Neutralizing Arafat is something that has to be taken into consideration and given lots of thought,\" said Raanan Gissin, adviser to the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon. \"Also it is the responsibility of the Palestinian people and this Palestinian government, if they are committed to peace ... to do what ever they can to neutralize this chairman Arafat, who has become the big spoiler of any effort to bring peace and hope to the Palestinian people.\" David Baker, a spokesman in the Israeli prime minister's office, said that the attack \"is another bloody chapter in the Palestinian history of carnage and terror\". Another Israeli spokesman, said: \"The bloody killing continues since the Sunday massacre. There's no doubt we are in the midst of attacks in the region. Terrorism has raised its head again. \"We have to fight the terrorists wherever they are. We have to take very tough decisions. If they don't dismantle terrorism, we will have to do it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
