Emergency over? Not quite. Nearly 53m gallons of oil remain in the water, which is almost five times the amount spilled by the Exxon Valdez in 1989. And there is uncertainty still about the basic facts of this disaster: how much oil went into the Gulf before it was capped on 15 July; how much of it evaporated from the ocean surface or dissolved in the water; and what will be the long-term environmental impact both of the oil and the quantities of dispersant used. Simply no one knows. The political fallout from this episode is clearer. Barack Obama performed the role of president badly, in the narrow sense that he failed to reflect back to the American people the frustration they felt. Here was no Reagan or Clinton \u2013 past masters of the performance arts \u2013 but a somewhat too stoical or deliberative figure who needed prompting in how to articulate the national mood of frustration and rage. No natural, he. Morally too, Mr Obama was in a weak position. Three days after the rig exploded, the White House said Mr Obama did not intend to back away from his proposal to extend offshore drilling. He did soon enough, suspending Arctic offshore drilling, cancelling lease sales in the western Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Virginia, announcing and then extending the moratorium on deepwater drilling for six months. But he had already ceded political ground. The Democrats may not be as mired in the politics of oil as those Republicans who cried \"Drill, baby, drill\", but they are nonetheless sufficiently stained by it to offer no coherent alternative. In the battle between BP and the most powerful government in the world, who was being dwarfed by whom? A multinational, a creature par excellence of neoliberal globalisation, was not too big to fail, but too big to control when it did. When the Kursk went down, Vladimir Putin found he did not have a deep-sea diving team capable of rescuing his submariners. They had all gone to Gazprom. The disaster was too big for a weakened state to handle. Mr Obama found himself in a similar position with BP. For all the posturing by the head of the government's response team, retired coastguard admiral Thad Allen, and his claims to have seized ownership of the operation to cap the well, it was always a BP operation. No one else had the technology, or the knowhow, to do it. This should make Mr Obama more cautious before he presses the restart button on offshore drilling. But somehow one feels that it won't."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
