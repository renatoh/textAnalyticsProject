We were the more generously served by Mayday, which the BBC ran over five successive nights, partly in deference to binge-watching trends, but also, perhaps, because they felt they had something to flaunt. And maybe they did. It was engaging in a British (ie non-Scandinavian) way, pulling us into the darker currents of the story by way of some light humour over an obese dog. Why was he so fat? More exercise, suggested the vet. Lesley Manville was wonderful as the dog's owner, Gail, half-indignant, half-bewildered (her default setting for the next five nights), eyes narrowing as her mind widened to admit the possibility that her husband, Malcolm (Peter Firth), was lying about the purpose of his two-hour walks in the woods of an evening. It would have mattered less had a 14-year-old girl not gone missing on her bike that bright morning, floating along in the familiar slow motion of the doomed \u2013 a fair Queen of the May in her floral crown and ribbons and diaphanous skirts a-blowing. And wasn't this the same Hattie whose protest group had scuppered Malcolm's plan to dig up the village green for an upscale housing estate and left him malicious, drinking too much and brooding over a scale model of the aborted project, complete with its tiny effigy of a girl hanging from a tree? Clearly something was bothering him (Peter Firth has surely never smiled less, even in his 10 years of Spooks). Perhaps he had ambushed Hattie and buried her beneath his birdwatcher's hide in the woods (Malcolm was that rare creature, a ruthless despoiler of the environment with a fondness for wildlife). Gail was worried. And she wasn't the only one. Alternative suspects started to pile up who were likewise richly garlanded with damning clues and ambiguous personal histories. Here was Alan, a police officer caught by his wife (Sophie Okonedo) acting suspiciously in a shower having arrived back from his shift spattered with blood; here an unhappy teenager, Linus (the impressive Max Fowler), finding his weird, sneering, video game-addicted father struggling to cram a body-shaped bag into the cupboard; Steve, a man with a self-administered haircut and history of aggression, was meanwhile going bonkers at his deranged brother Seth, who not only worshipped trees but was dressed like one when the girl was last glimpsed alive, screaming through the woods not far from the May Day parade with its ancestral jingling and prancing men and vacant willow throne. This was the drama's selling point, a multiplicity of suspects as seen through the anxious eyes of their loved ones. In a sense, it eluded the conventions of a generic crime story (you could safely describe the police presence as largely ceremonial), its emotional centre shifting, rather, with the workings of vexatious marriages, friendships and parental relations. Love and betrayal were more viscerally felt than revenge or justice (despite the noise of vigilantes in the street), leaving the girl as little more than a whodunnit to be fathomed by Thursday. It gave us invention and flair and good acting throughout, but the denouement \u2013 which looked like a warning against last-minute packing, with stuff forgotten and bits of plot still sticking out of the sides \u2013 relied too much on pagan whimsy to satisfy those expecting a more orthodox arrangement of punishment and reward. ITV's eight-part drama Broadchurch kicked off on a less fanciful note, with an 11-year-old boy found strangled at the foot of a cliff overlooking the sea. He was the son of Mark, who was the town's most popular plumber, judging by the number of people greeting him as he joshed his way down the high street in an unwitting homage to An American in Paris. Was he going to burst into song? He settled for tears \u2013 and authentic-looking ones \u2013 when he finally got the bad news (and even then he stopped to sign a petition to save the hospital), but could you trust him? He'd been out until the small hours the night before (when his son had vanished) \u2013 \"on a job\", as he tersely explained to his wife, as if no further explanation were necessary, because obviously plumbing is almost like being in the fire service. The police were on top of things with the arrival of outsider David Tennant as charmless crosspatch DI Alec Hardy, who had something to prove, having recently buggered up his last murder case (though, oddly, it hadn't stopped him getting promotion at the expense of local favourite DS Ellie Miller (the splendid Olivia Colman), who of course also now had something to prove herself. But she was buggering up too, getting in a flap on account of being friends with the dead boy's family and then inadvertently tipping the wink to a local junior reporter (her nephew \u2013 yes, yes, it's a small town!), who also had something to prove, having just that morning been turned down for a job by the Daily Mail. It wasn't long before his tweet reached the ears of a Fleet Street hack (Vicky McClure), who duly turned up to sniff the air. Did she have something to prove? Perhaps just that journalists are wily and unscrupulous. She was soon sprouting horns. It's probably worth tuning in this week to see what sullen-looking Pauline Quirke was doing drinking tea near a caravan. I have a feeling she knows something. BBC4 finally decided to buy the hit sitcom Parks and Recreation just five seasons after it started in the US. Amy Poehler is a gem as Leslie Knope, an enthusiastic local government officer who promises to get a park built on the site of a vacant lot (as they call holes in the ground over there) after someone broke their legs falling in. The show resembles The Office (it was made by the creators of the American version) insofar as it is filmed \"mockumentary\" style and has a deluded Gareth-like character (Tom) who thinks he can talk to women. It wasn't quite hilarious, but apparently there are format adjustments ahead that make it more so. As Leslie says: \"Just dream with me for a second\u2026\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
