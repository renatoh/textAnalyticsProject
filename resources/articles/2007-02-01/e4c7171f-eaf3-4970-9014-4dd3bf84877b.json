Tom Cruise is the goateed Vincent, a killer who persuades cabby Max (Jamie Foxx) to chauffeur him from hit to hit. The plot grows a little contrived as the new love of Max's life, Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith), is roped in, but this is as cool, taut and well-acted a new noir as you could hope for. Saw 10pm, Sky Movies 2 (James Wan, 2004) A photographer (the film's co-writer, Leigh Whannell) and a surgeon (Cary Elwes) wake up chained to the walls of a festering basement room: they are the latest victims of the sick serial killer Jigsaw, and horrors await. The set-up, and nerve-jangling twists that follow it, are the product of a seriously warped imagination. Remember Seven? This is more 77. Truly horrid. The Pillow Book 12.50am, Film4 (Peter Greenaway, 1995) Even by Greenaway's standards an outlandish conceit. It's the story of Nagito (Vivian Wu), a woman who has grown up with a body-art fetish: her lovers leave inscriptions on her body, until Ewan McGregor's Jerome turns up and invites her to make an illustrated man of him. Interweaving cool zen with the jealous rage of Empire of the Senses, it's an enigmatic but seductive experience."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
