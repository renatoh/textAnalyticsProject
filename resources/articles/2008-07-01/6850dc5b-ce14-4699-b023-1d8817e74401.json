Fourteen of his works are included in the Albert Hall concerts, and among them are two of the four epics that dominated the last quarter-century of his creative life. The second of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales's programmes with its principal conductor Thierry Fischer was devoted to Messiaen's sole oratorio, La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur J\u00e9sus-Christ. It is a massive score lasting 100 minutes, with 14 movements setting texts from the Old and New Testaments, the Roman Catholic liturgy and the writings of Thomas Aquinas. The effect is like a frieze - static, non-developmental pieces wondering at the miracle of Christ's transfiguration. The orchestral writing provides the dramatic variety - moments of apocalyptic grandeur, joyous fusillades of birdsong in Chronochromie - and in the use of a group of concertante soloists, looks forward to the two later, sparer orchestral cycles. Sonia Wieder-Atherton made everything she could of the two movements in which solo cello features most prominently; Gerard Bouwhuis was the neat unfussy pianist. Fischer's performance, with the combined forces of the BBC National Chorus of Wales, the BBC Symphony Chorus and the Philharmonia Voices, was fine-grained and precise, too, and he caught much of the necessary radiance and grandeur, even if, in the vast expanses of the RAH, the final movements lacked a sense of inevitability and devastating power."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
