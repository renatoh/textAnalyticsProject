Vonk fell unobtrusively into the latter class, and he remained true to his values during the last five years of his career as music director of the St Louis Symphony Orchestra, in Missouri. It was a period he described candidly as having been \"the happiest and most fulfilling of my career\", at the time the unspecified neurological disease which led to his death became uncontrollable in the spring of 2002. Of his St Louis players, who reciprocated the affection, he once said: \"they are a special kind of people, and I am one of them\". Vonk's father, a violinist in Amsterdam's great Concertgebouw Orchestra, died when Hans was three years old. Along with his sister, Vonk followed his mother's wishes by studying law at Amsterdam University, playing jazz piano in his spare time to support himself; music became the centre of his life when he moved to the Amsterdam Conservatory, discovering his true vocation after accompanying for a conducting class. Studies with the rigorous Hermann Scherchen and Franco Ferrara led to his first post with the Dutch Ballet shortly after his graduation in 1966. There he met and fell in love with the red-headed ballerina Jessie Folkerts, the wife of three decades who survives him. He became an assistant conductor at the Concertgebouw in 1969, and conducted his first opera at the Netherlands Opera in 1971, a Lorca-based drama by the singular German serialist Wolfgang Fortner. Vonk's commitment to contemporary music always came second to his love and understanding of the romantic repertoire, crowned by his Bruckner interpretations, but he remained a stalwart ambassador for Dutch music, of which he has left a central legacy in the shape of a six-CD set. Alongside further important positions with orchestras in his native land - the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic from 1973, the Hague Residentie Orchestra from 1980 - Vonk now began to appear with orchestras elsewhere in Europe and in America. He made his debut with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra in 1974, and was associate conductor of London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra from 1976 to 1979. Among his many recordings from this period is an outstanding, underrated partnership in Rachmaninov with the pianist Ilana Vered and the London Symphony Orchestra. What should have been the most important move in his conducting career turned out to be something of a poisoned chalice. In 1985 he accepted an invitation from the East German authorities to take on both the Dresden Staatskapelle Orchestra and the Dresden Opera, a double responsibility only the eminent Austrian-born conductor Karl B\u00f6hm had undertaken before him. Permitted to talk to players only at rehearsals, Vonk found the results alien to his spirit of cooperative conducting, and he was happier moving to West Germany and the Cologne Radio Symphony Orchestra in 1991. Nevertheless he achieved many fine things in Dresden, conducting Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier at the newly renovated Semperoper; a recording was subsequently released. Londoners may also recall a Staatskapelle visit crowned by a performance of Strauss's Ein Heldenleben in the understated, free-flowing tradition of B\u00f6hm and Rudolf Kempe. By the time he left Dresden, Vonk had already been diagnosed with what was then - in 1988 - believed to be Guillain-Barre syndrome; after a year's respite, he was back on the podium. As his St Louis residency progressed, it became clear that the symptoms - increasing muscular weakness starting with the hands and feet - were taking a different course, and his neurological condition was identified as similar to Lou Gehrig's disease. In February 2002, he had to be helped from the podium after finding he could not turn the pages of a score by Samuel Barber, and he resigned his post shortly before giving his last concert that May. He bowed out in style with a performance of Mahler's Fourth Symphony. \u00b7 Hans Vonk, conductor, born 18 June 1941; died 29 August 2004"}, "isHosted": false}}}
