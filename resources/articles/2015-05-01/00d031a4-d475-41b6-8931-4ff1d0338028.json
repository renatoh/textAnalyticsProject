The 29-year-old Australian had been linked with the Top 14 side Stade Fran\u00e7ais but has instead opted to remain in the Premiership and relocate to Devon. Salvi will find himself among familiar company, with his Tigers colleague Geoff Parling also heading to Sandy Park and a former team-mate, Thomas Waldrom, already in situ. Given his reputation as one of the top breakdown operators in the league, Salvi could prove an excellent recruit for the upwardly-mobile Chiefs. With Jamie Gibson also moving down the road to Northampton and Brad Thorn due to retire, Leicester are leaking an unusual amount of talent as they await the arrival of their new head coach, Aaron Mauger. The Canberra-born Salvi, who also played one season for Bath, has been a hugely influential figure at Welford Road but negotiations over a potential new contract grew increasingly acrimonious. It is understood he ultimately rejected bigger financial packages from elsewhere to sign for the Chiefs. Exeter are also ready to play Jack Nowell at full-back in Saturday\u2019s crucial final Premiership fixture against Sale Sharks. The England winger missed last Saturday\u2019s win at Saracens \u2013 previously in his career his knee has not reacted well to playing on artificial surfaces, such as that at Allianz Park \u2013 but is now set to feature at No15 with another potential England training squad member, Henry Slade, remaining at outside-centre. If Leicester beat Northampton, however, Exeter may yet miss out on the play-offs regardless of the outcome of their game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
