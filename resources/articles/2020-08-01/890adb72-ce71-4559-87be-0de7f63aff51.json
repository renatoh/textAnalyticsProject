Like many top sprinters, though, he often ends up beating much the same field from one race to the next. Not so this time, when Tim Easterby\u2019s Art Power (3.15) promises to be a fascinating fresh opponent for Charlie Hills\u2019s gelding. Art Power looked every inch a Group One horse in the making when successful in a five-furlong handicap at Royal Ascot, where he also recorded an exceptional time without ever coming under pressure. An on-form Battaash sets the bar much higher but with five runs behind him, Art Power has scope for further improvement. At a likely price of around 3-1, he is a fair price to bridge the gap, not least as Battaash has always been capable of throwing in the occasional poor run. York 1.45 Zabeel Champion lost ground at the start and so could not race up with the pace at Goodwood last time, then took time to hit top gear before coming up three-quarters of a length short of a surprise winner. The step up to a mile-and-a-half is an obvious next move for Mark Johnston\u2019s lightly raced colt and Ryan Moore should be able to settle on or near the lead from a draw near the rail. York 2.15 There were three runners for the Lillie Langtry at Glorious Goodwood and Enbihaar was a short-priced favourite, but she was a very smooth winner all the same and continues to develop into a high-class stayer. There is no obvious reason why this step up to two miles will not suit and while Nayef Road brings Group One form into the race, Enbihaar looks to have the edge in terms of talent. York 2.45 Yazaman is the top-rated juvenile in this year\u2019s Gimcrack having twice finished second at Group Two level this summer. He was soundly beaten by Supremacy when favourite for the Richmond at Goodwood, however, and the potential improvers in the field make more appeal. Minzaal is the likely favourite and would have given Mohawk King something to think about on debut at Ascot with a clearer run. Richard Hannon left no one in any doubt about his regard for Mohawk King after that race, however, and he is a solid bet at around 4-1 to confirm the Ascot form. York 3.45 Naval Crown raced in Listed company last time but found less than seemed likely in the closing stages and looks short enough at around 5-4. Tawleed showed enough on debut at Goodwood last month behind the impressive Alkumait to suggest he will give the favourite plenty to think about."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
