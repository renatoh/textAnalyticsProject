It was my opinion at the time and I stand by that opinion.\u201d After two days of testimony dominated by Musk\u2019s global celebrity, the British cave explorer took center stage in Thursday\u2019s proceedings. Unsworth had testified feelingly on Wednesday about the impact of being \u201cbranded a pedophile\u201d by Musk\u2019s tweets, which were published by an account with approximately 22 million followers. \u201cI feel humiliated, ashamed, dirty \u2026 I was effectively given a life sentence without parole.\u201d But under cross-examination, Unsworth\u2019s own words were placed under the microscope. Unsworth had mocked Musk\u2019s submarine in an interview with CNN, deeming it a \u201cPR stunt\u201d and saying Musk should \u201cstick his submarine where it hurts\u201d. Additional questioning appeared designed to undercut Unsworth\u2019s claim to have suffered emotional distress over Musk\u2019s words. After it was established that Unsworth had not mentioned such distress in many thousands of text messages exchanged over months with a half-dozen friends, the 64-year-old said: \u201cI very rarely talk to my friends about my emotional issues, certainly not in text messages. I bottle it up.\u201d Price also displayed a photo of Unsworth and other members of the British rescue team taken with Theresa May outside 10 Downing Street. \u201cYou would agree that the prime minister of England would not want to be seen with someone who is a pedophile?\u201d Price asked. In discussing his investiture as a member of the Order of the British Empire, Unsworth said that Prince William \u201csuddenly mentioned the situation that existed with Mr Musk\u201d. However, the judge prevented Unsworth from relaying what Prince William said about Musk. On Tuesday, Unsworth had testified that the great honor of his MBE was clouded by his shame at the \u201cpedo guy\u201d smear, and said he only attended his investiture because his mother, partner and niece asked him to. Further questions addressed Unsworth\u2019s involvement with various film and book projects about the cave rescue. Unsworth said that he briefly engaged an agent and hoped to sell his story for a substantial sum, as others involved in the rescue have done, but none of the projects materialized. Unsworth did assist with three book projects for free, including a children\u2019s book, and was paid a total of \u00a32,600 ($3,400) for appearing in two documentaries, he said. Unsworth works as a financial consultant and earns approximately \u00a325,000 annually, he testified. Dr Jim Jansen, a professor of computer science at Penn State university, provided expert testimony for the plaintiffs on the \u201clevel of online dissemination\u201d of Musk\u2019s \u201cpedo guy\u201d statement. Jansen testified that 490 articles had appeared on 361 websites in 33 countries about Musk\u2019s remarks, based on searches limited to the English language and excluding articles about Unsworth\u2019s litigation. The jury also heard excerpts from a video deposition by Unsworth\u2019s wife, Vanessa Unsworth. The couple have been living separate lives since around 2006 but remain married. Vanessa testified that her husband was \u201creally devastated\u201d by Musk\u2019s remark and said she was \u201cincredibly proud\u201d of his actions in the cave rescue. Asked about Unsworth\u2019s criticism of Musk, she said: \u201cIt is a comment that, as Brits, we do say: \u2018Stick it where the sun doesn\u2019t shine.\u2019\u201d Musk\u2019s defense attorneys did not call any witnesses. The defense asked the judge to decide the case on the law, arguing that \u201cno reasonable jury could find for Unsworth on the basis of law\u201d, which the judge refused to do. The trial will continue on Friday morning with closing arguments and jury instructions, after which the jury will deliberate. In his own testimony earlier this week, Musk, 48, apologized to Unsworth and said he did not believe the cave explorer was a pedophile. He also dismissed the tweets as an \u201coff the cuff\u201d response to watching a replay of Unsworth\u2019s CNN interview, at a time he felt overworked from running Tesla, which makes electric cars, and SpaceX, a rocket company that offered the mini-submarine. To win his lawsuit, Unsworth needs to show Musk was negligent in publishing a falsehood that clearly identified him and caused him harm. He does not need to show that Musk acted with \u201cactual malice\u201d, which is much tougher to prove.
