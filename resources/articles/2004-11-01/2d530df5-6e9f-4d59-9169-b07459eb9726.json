'I bought this poster two years ago when I had a cinema built in my big house in Surrey,' said Evans. 'Then when I sold the house last month, we hung it on the wall of my production company offices. 'I liked having it hanging there - it is such a fantastic romp of a film - but if it inspires people to donate to The Observer 's Christmas charities, then bring it on.' For a chance to win the poster for just \u00a3250 - the price Evans was charging on his stall - readers should send their full name, postal address and a contact telephone number in an email to letters@observer.co.uk - putting 'Christmas Appeal - Evans Poster' as the subject heading of the email. The \u00a3250 will go to the Observer appeal and a winner will be announced on 12 December. Wrapped up against the cold in a multi-coloured scarf and bargaining hap pily with customers keen to buy his opulent sofas, Daisy Duck lightstands and dog-chewed side tables, Evans insisted that selling more than \u00a31 million of possessions was not a sad event. Despite coming in the wake of his divorce from the singer and actress Billie Piper, the sale of eight of his nine houses, and a court action that cost him \u00a318m following his dismissal by Virgin Radio, Evans hinted he was looking forward to a busy future. 'This is the one thing I have done in the last two years that's me,' he said. 'You know when you just get into a time that's right for you? Everything is just working out; this moment has a vibe about it. It's exciting. 'There's no plan but something is going on,' he added. 'Will I go back on the radio? There is news in that one but not today. At the moment, I am looking forward to sitting here every day, writing something I am not going to talk about just now.' The idea for the Evans &amp; Winterbottom stall was cooked up between Evans and his best friend, Pete Winterbottom, two weeks ago. 'We have just three rules,' said Evans. 'Big Pete's word is final; discounts will be given to people who tell us something we don't know; and we don't sell to bad people. I think I know who the bad people are,' he added. 'Or at least, I think I do.' The simplicity of the arrangement with Camden's Stable Market - a single page contract signed one week at a time - has appealed to Evans. 'This is the absolutely perfect deal for me now,' he said. 'Nobody teaches you how to be wealthy and materialism has not bought me happiness. I had nine houses which is a bit repugnant, don't you think? I was going to keep all the stuff in my Belsize Park house but then I got into a bit of a frenzy of clearing out. 'I think that if you don't think about things too much, that's the key,' he added. 'If you think about things, you're in trouble.' \u00b7 To win the poster for just \u00a3250 - the price Evans was charging on his stall - readers should send there full name, postal address and a contact telephone number in an email to letters@observer.co.uk.
