In a speech to the Queensland Resources Council on Friday, the prime minister said a threat to the future of mining was coming from a \u201cnew breed of radical activism\u201d and signalled the government would seek to apply penalties to those targeting businesses who provide services to the resources industry. Civil society groups, including the Human Rights Law Centre and Australian Conservation Foundation, and the Greens immediately attacked the proposal as undemocratic and a bid to stifle a social movement fighting for Australia to take action on climate change. Morrison told Australian corporations to listen to the \u201cquiet shareholders\u201d and not environmental protesters, who he suggested could shift targets from coal companies to all carbon-intensive industries including power generation, gas projects, abattoirs and airlines. In a speech proposing limits on free speech advocating boycotts against polluting companies, Morrison said progressives wanted to tell Australians \u201cwhat you can say, what you can think and tax you more for the privilege of all of those instructions\u201d. He claimed that \u201cprogressivism\u201d \u2013 which he labelled a \u201cnew-speak type term\u201d, invoking George Orwell \u2013 intends \u201cto get in under the radar, but at its heart would deny the liberties of Australians\u201d. \u201cApocalyptic in tone, it brooks no compromise,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cIt\u2019s all or nothing. Alternative views are not permitted.\u201d He pointed to the \u201cworrying development\u201d of environmental groups targeting businesses or firms involved in the mining sector with \u201csecondary boycotts\u201d, such as businesses refusing to provide banking, insurance or consultancy services. \u201cThey are targeting businesses of all sizes, including small businesses, like contracting businesses in regional Queensland.\u201d \u201cLet me assure you this is not something my government intends to allow to go unchecked. \u201cTogether with the attorney general, we are working to identify mechanisms that can successfully outlaw these indulgent and selfish practices that threaten the livelihoods of fellow Australians.\u201d But Morrison admitted the government \u201ccan\u2019t force one Australian company to provide a service to another\u201d. The Greens were quick to reverse the charge of intolerance and level it at Morrison, with acting leader Adam Bandt labelling him \u201ca direct threat to Australian democracy and freedom of speech\u201d. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s commitment to outlaw the peaceful, legal protest of Australian individuals and community groups reads like a move straight from the totalitarian\u2019s playbook,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of getting tough on the climate crisis, Scott Morrison is dismantling democracy.\u201d The executive director of the Human Rights Law Centre, Hugh de Kretser, said the plan to crack down on boycotts was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. \u201cProtest is an essential part of our democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cTo protect our democracy and help ensure a better future for all Australians, governments should be strengthening our rights to come together and protest, not weakening them.\u201d The Competition and Consumer Act already contains civil penalties for secondary boycotts, which target one business in order to prevent provision of goods or services to another, including if they cause \u201csubstantial loss or damage\u201d or substantially lessen competition. However, secondary boycotts for the \u201cdominant purpose\u201d of environmental protection or consumer protection are permitted. In 2014 the Abbott government considered applying penalties to environmental boycotts. In 2015 the Harper competition review said in the absence of \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d on the point it saw no need for change although the exception should be reassessed \u201cif such evidence arises from future boycott activity\u201d. Earlier on Friday Morrison told 3AW Radio that there is \u201cof course the right to protest in this country\u201d but claimed recent environmental protests in Melbourne were \u201cwell beyond the pale\u201d because protesters had allegedly spat at people in business shirts. \u201cIf it\u2019s not OK to have secondary boycotts being run by unions \u2026 it\u2019s not OK for environmental, well, they\u2019re anarchist groups \u2026 to be able to disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their livelihoods, to harass people as we saw down in Melbourne,\u201d he said. The chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Kelly O\u2019Shanassy, said community campaigning was a \u201clegitimate response\u201d voicing the concerns about global heating shared by millions of Australians. \u201cPeople protesting in the streets are not the only ones expressing alarm about climate change \u2013 the head of the Defence Force, the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority have all recently raised serious concerns,\u201d she said. \u201cTo paint this broad community concern as being about fringe-dwelling extremists is an insult to all Australians who want a better future for themselves and their children. \u201cPoliticians have a responsibility to defend our democracy, not degrade it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
