For the Bundjalung of north-east New South Wales, it is the gunggayay, or red-bellied black snake. On the spine of Archie Roach\u2019s memoir, Tell Me Why, the gunggayay encircles the kneeangar, a logo that encapsulates the Indigenous songwriter\u2019s heritage: his Bundjalung father Archie Senior, and his Gunditjmara mother Nellie Austin. But Roach, who first came to national attention in 1990 with his celebrated song Took the Children Away and accompanying debut album Charcoal Lane, is also the foster son of Alex and Dulcie Cox: Dad Alex and Mum Dulcie, as he calls them. The Coxes were told that Archie\u2019s birth parents had died in a house fire. In fact, he had been stolen from them in the late 1950s at Framlingham mission, near Warrnambool. \u201cThey were used,\u201d Roach, now 63, says when we meet, as he rests in a Sydney hotel room. \u201cThey\u2019re blameless, as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d Alex and Dulcie cherished Archie but, he writes, \u201cthere was always a restlessness in me, like a faultline waiting to rupture\u201d. When he was 15, he received a letter from a hitherto unknown sister, Myrtle \u2013 one of six siblings \u2013 telling him Nellie had died. The faultline ruptured. Roach writes that before leaving to find his brothers and sisters, Dad Alex \u2013 a Glaswegian immigrant who also yearned for his homeland \u2013 told him: \u201cBifay ye leave me and Ma, I jes wanted tae say \u2026 Well, we hope ye fin what ye lookin for, Archie.\u201d He never saw them again. The title of Tell Me Why \u2013 which is being released alongside an album of new songs and re-recorded versions of many of his classics \u2013 is both rhetorical and a plea. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to come to terms with it happening, rather than denying that it happened or just pushing it aside and thinking, \u2018Oh, something happened to me as a kid, but it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u2019 \u201cIt was more than that. You want to assure people, or reassure people, that this actually happened. And yourself as well.\u201d Roach frequently slips into the second person, talking about \u201cyourself\u201d when he\u2019s actually referring to himself, preserving a kind of distance. In his concerts, Roach has taken to introducing Took the Children Away by saying that every time he sings it, he lets a little bit of pain go. One day, he says, that pain will be gone and he will be free. Similarly, he tells the Guardian that the process of writing Tell Me Why helped heal some of his grief for his estranged, now deceased adoptive parents. \u201cI\u2019d never talked about them before, and I was able to do that, so I was able to let that go.\u201d He also wanted to acknowledge their pain. \u201cPeople need to understand that as well, that some of the families, maybe a lot of the families: what they did [was] out of the goodness of their hearts, and out of love.\u201d Tell Me Why reveals much more of Roach than was previously known. Nearly half the book is taken up with his years of drinking in the parks and pubs and \u201cempties\u201d (vacant buildings) of Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, as he reconnected with his surviving family members. Roach\u2019s street years are recalled with fondness. \u201cThere was a real sense of community with those people, and nobody [outside of it] heard that conversation, so I wanted to take people on that journey,\u201d he says. Naturally, those years also took a terrible toll. Roach suffered from epilepsy as a result of his alcoholism, and there\u2019s a shockingly raw description of a suicide attempt at the end of a bender, after an attempt to dry out. There are stints in hospital, and prison too. Roach has also survived a stroke, has had half a lung removed due to cancer, and gave up a kidney to his late brother Lawrence. The transplant wasn\u2019t a success. These days, Roach needs a wheelchair to get around, and has a tendency to speak with his eyes closed. But when he fixes them on you, they\u2019re full of light. Of his attempt on his life, Roach says it\u2019s something he \u201cprobably should have mentioned before\u201d, with suicide rates among Aboriginal people, including children, at epidemic levels. \u201cYou can reach the darkest point in our life and come back, and come good, even better.\u201d But Tell Me Why is also a love story for Roach\u2019s partner Ruby Hunter, who died in 2010. Hunter, too, had been stolen; she and Roach referred to each other as \u201cdad\u201d and \u201cmum\u201d respectively. \u201cIt was a term of endearment,\u201d Roach chuckles. But there was also more to it: \u201cIt\u2019s good to use those words \u2018mum\u2019 and \u2018dad\u2019, they\u2019re very powerful words when you\u2019re a stolen kid. I suppose they take on deeper meaning when you\u2019re a bit older, as well.\u201d It was Hunter who kicked Roach up the backside when, on the cusp of his first album and record deal, Roach nearly walked away from music entirely. It was 1990, and Paul Kelly and guitarist Steve Connolly had billed the almost unknown artist on a gig at what is now Melbourne\u2019s Hamer Hall, to a dumbstruck audience. Roach played just two songs, Beautiful Child and Took the Children Away. The latter song, sung in Roach\u2019s pure, earnest voice, starts with the words, \u201cThis story\u2019s right, this story\u2019s true. I would not tell lies to you.\u201d Both songs were met with complete silence. Then, as he left the stage, the applause began: \u201cIt started slowly and then it came down hard. I turned around and held my guitar up in the air, like this\u201d \u2013 he raises his arms \u2013 \u201cyeah!\u201d He had first played Took the Children Away in Sydney in 1988, at a Bicentennial protest. On that occasion, too, the crowd had been left stunned and weeping. When he later played the song on a community radio station in Melbourne, the switchboard lit up. The term \u201cstolen generations\u201d didn\u2019t exist in the popular consciousness back then, and Roach, a shy man, was uncomfortable being a spokesman for them. \u201cI was reluctant, I think, to put myself out there and have that sort of scrutiny,\u201d he confesses. \u201cIt frightened me a bit.\u201d He told Hunter he\u2019d quit. Hunter, Roach writes, drew herself up to her full height \u2013 which admittedly was not very much \u2013 put her hands on her hips and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not all about you, Archie Roach. How many blackfellas you reckon get to record an album?\u201d Other Indigenous singer-songwriters followed. One, Adam Briggs, recorded a sequel to Took the Children Away, and invited Roach to guest on AB Original\u2019s album, on which Roach spoke of bringing Melbourne to a standstill during land rights marches in the 70s and 80s. While his songs are quiet \u2013 he writes that \u201cempathy was my impetus\u201d \u2013 he reserves a place for anger and direct action. \u201cA lot of people are getting upset about young people in the street disrupting traffic, especially these climate protesters,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m thinking, well, what\u2019s a day\u2019s disruption compared to the total annihilation of the planet? What\u2019s wrong with you people? You need to make a racket! You need to be in their face.\u201d Before he left the Cox family, Roach worshipped at a Pentecostal church in Melbourne, and even spoke in tongues. He drew comfort from the hymns that informed his own songs, and from Jesus\u2019 words: \u201cSuffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not.\u201d Roach eventually reconciled his Christian upbringing with his own heritage. \u201cI found my own culture, which is not so much about religion but it\u2019s about being a spiritual person, in our connection to the earth and the cosmos.\u201d Around his neck hangs a necklace, at the end of which flies a wedge-tailed eagle. \u2022 Tell Me Why by Archie Roach is out now through Simon &amp; Schuster.
