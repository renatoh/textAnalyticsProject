The economy has already been hit by a series of high-profile companies to file for insolvency this year, including construction group Philipp Holzmann, aircraft maker Fairchild Dornier and stationery maker Herlitz.With the future of the Kirch media group still in doubt, the issue of business failures has threatened to move sharply up the political agenda. However, analysts argue that concern about the impact of the growing number of companies seeking protection from their creditors could be overdone. Overall, the number of companies declared insolvent rose 14% to 32,278 last year - affecting some 200,000 workers, according to the Federal Statistics Office. Less than 10 years ago the record number of insolvencies was about 20,000. Holger Fahrinkrug at UBS Warburg in Frankfurt pointed out that the vast majority of the firms filing for insolvency employed less than 100 people. He said the rise in the number of insolvencies reflected the big increase in the number of start-ups in \"new economy\" sectors in recent years which have been hit by the downturn. \"It is not good news but there is good news within the bad. I think the increase reflects a greater degree of flexibility within the economy with perhaps less risk aversion.\" Ralph Solveen at Commerzbank took a similar view. \"I think it is the normal cycle. After the cycle has troughed you have a pick up in insolvencies and we have had more new businesses in new media and information technology.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
