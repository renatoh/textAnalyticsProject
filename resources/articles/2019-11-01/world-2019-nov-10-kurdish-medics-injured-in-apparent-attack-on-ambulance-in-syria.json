The ambulance, which had red markings indicating it was a medical vehicle, was heading to villages north of the town of Tal Tamr on Saturday afternoon when it was struck by shrapnel from a weapon that exploded close by. The two paramedics inside were injured in the blast. \u201cThe ambulance was targeted with heavy weapons,\u201d said Cadus, an independent German aid group and joint operator of the vehicle. \u201cAt the time of the attack our ambulance was not operating at the frontline.\u201d Aram Hamidi, a Kurdish paramedic in the vehicle, said it had been hit by Turkish fire. \u201cOur ambulance was struck and destroyed,\u201d he said in a video interview released by the Rojava Information Center, a media collective working in the area. \u201cBoth I and my colleague who was driving were injured \u2026 I was wounded by shrapnel. I still have a piece in my jaw, and all my teeth are broken.\u201d Photographs of the ambulance \u2013 also operated by the Kurdish Red Crescent, a humanitarian organisation not affiliated with the International Committee of the Red Cross \u2013 showed cracked windows and bloodstains on the seats. A series of agreements between Ankara, Moscow and Washington halted a Turkish invasion of north-eastern Syria earlier this month, but fighting continues on the frontiers of territory under Turkey\u2019s control. Kurdish groups say medical personnel have been targeted throughout the Turkish operation in the area and continue to be vulnerable. The Rojava Information Center estimates that five medical personnel have been killed since the invasion began last month. Three were abducted and executed and two died in drone strikes. A further seven at least have been injured, it said. Sebastian J\u00fcnemann, the chief executive of Cadus, said it was unclear whether the ambulance had been hit by a drone or artillery fire, and that it was hard to tell if had been deliberately targeted. He said Cadus coordinated its movements with the UN\u2019s civil-military coordination centre. \u201cWe have been targeted by Isis in Mosul but never by a state actor like Turkey for example,\u201d J\u00fcnemann said. \u201cIn Mosul we took certain security measures \u2026 but in this situation the actor is a Nato member so we are assured that we are secure. Normally we should be safe.\u201d Kurdish groups accuse Turkish forces and their militia allies of attacking Kurdish Red Crescent medical infrastructure, including the repeated targeting of a hospital in the city of Ras al-Ayn, and an artillery shell that landed near a medical convoy a week ago, killing a member of the Free Burma Rangers, an independent humanitarian group. The Turkish government has consistently denied it deliberately targets medical vehicles or facilities. The Turkish foreign ministry has been contacted for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
