Set up by Henry Stewart in his back room a decade ago, it employed 20 people last year, now has 40 (a quarter male) and is still recruiting. Callus works four days a week; Stewart, 41, spends Thursday mornings in his children's school; another employee works only in term time. Jane Rostron, 38, joined four years ago. She has worked both a three-day and a four-day week, and during maternity leave she brought her daughter into the office once a month to keep up to date. \"It made the whole process seamless,\" she says. \"Working here isn't an easy ride, you have to be seen to succeed, but the culture is wonderful because it's so human.\" Maternity leave is six weeks on full pay, six weeks on half; the job is held for nine months with additional unpaid leave granted for a further five years. Fathers are given five days' paid leave and up to four months' unpaid. Salaries are an open book, staff choose their own job description and mistakes are \"celebrated\" as a chance to learn from failure. Everyone is encouraged to join a union and to try another person's job to understand how the system works. \"We look for attitude and train for skill, so qualifications matter less,\" Callus says. \"We believe in teamwork and positivity - if you are interested in status, there's no place for you here.\" Each person spends a day a month on voluntary work and is given \u00a375 a year to donate to charity. It is said a major hurdle in the adoption of flexibility and a work- life agenda is that 97% of Britain's companies employ under 20 staff. Stephen Alambritis heads the Federation of Small Businesses which represents 160,000 small companies, 40,000 run by women. He says the government may permit a clause that will allow a small business to opt out of, say, extending parental rights if it can be proved this may harm the company. He also warns that too many \"extras\" attached to female employment might mean some bosses resist hiring women - a move he is at pains to condemn. Happy Computers' experience, however, is that a modernised workplace boosts profits. Since staff stay, reduced recruitment costs have saved \u00a340,000 in the past 12 months - and turnover is up 37%. \"Our approach isn't complicated,\" Stewart explains. \"We believe people work best when they feel good about themselves.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
