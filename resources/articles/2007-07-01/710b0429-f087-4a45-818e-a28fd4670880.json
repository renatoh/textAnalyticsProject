It is important to appreciate the dimensions of the social problems which have affected Australian Aboriginals for decades. But it is just as important to understand that Flanagan, who claimed that prime minister John Howard \"was widely perceived to play the race card\", is fundamentally out of step with the great majority of both the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities. Aborigines constitute nearly one-third of the Northern Territory, and the dimensions of their health problems are horrendous. Compared to other Australians, life expectancy is 20 years lower, infant mortality nearly three times higher, diabetes 7-10 times higher, and tuberculosis nearly five times higher. Alcoholism is endemic. Unemployment is three times higher and the imprisonment rate 16 times higher. The real tragedy is that more than 30 years of land rights, with an accompanying slice of mineral riches, and many more years of welfare and housing programs, have made little difference. The recent Northern Territory report confirmed the extent of the devastation: child sexual abuse is serious, widespread and often unreported. In response, the Australian government proposed severe limits on alcohol; medical examinations of all indigenous children; at least 50% of welfare payments to go to children; income support conditional upon school attendance; compulsory acquisition of townships for five years; work for the dole linked to intensive clean-up of communities and a ban on possession of pornography. Flanagan trotted out the claim that Howard only won the 2001 election because he turned away a boat hired by professional people smugglers. Apart from never mentioning that Australia has one of the most generous refugee intakes in the world, this canard ignores the fact that opinion polls showed that he was already well on the way to winning. Flanagan dismisses the need to promote national values as \"an oily phrase that appears to be a stalking horse for a new intolerance\". This is little more than perfervid conspiracy theory, nowhere more graphically demonstrated than in Flanagan's preferred alternative approach - as if people marching across Sydney Harbour Bridge in the name of reconciliation is any substitute for practical life-saving action. Flanagan acknowledges that the Northern Territory report \"presented a horrifying picture of black Australia in collapse\", yet offers no solutions. And he is at a loss to explain why Noel Pearson - in Flanagan's own words \"one of black Australia's most gifted and articulate leaders\" - has long advocated a similar plan. Pearson knows that self-determination had, with the Aboriginal parliament, turned into a hollow catchphrase. The road ahead will not be easy but millions of Australians, who have enormous sympathy for the plight of their fellow countrymen, will be very encouraged that someone has finally had the courage and determination to act.
