The lead author of the report published in the journal Nature, Professor Steven Chown of Monash University, characterised the biodiversity outlook for Antarctica and the Southern Ocean as being \u201cno better than that for the rest of the globe\u201d, despite its relative isolation. The Antarctic marine system hosts more than 8,000 different species, with 50-90% of the species endemic to the region, including sea spiders, isopods and the wandering albatross. On land, there was a \u201cmassive diversity\u201d of viruses living in bodies of freshwater and an \u201cextremely well-developed microbial community\u201d. \u201cMost people think of the continent as a vast, icy waste, and the sea as uniformly populated by whales, seals and penguins,\u201d Chown said. \u201cBut that\u2019s simply not true. \u201cCertainly you wouldn\u2019t see the same level of diversity as somewhere like the Daintree rainforest in Queensland, but if I was a microbiologist I\u2019d say the Antarctic was home to an amazing diversity of organisms.\u201d Antarctica, roughly the size of the US and Mexico combined, was not a single, homogenous area but had 15 distinct biogeographic zones, Chown said. These included the dramatic, 4,000 metre heights of the Trans-Antarctic Mountains, home to \u201creally unusual lichens and mosses\u201d, and the geothermally heated volcanoes of the north-east Antarctic peninsula, which played an important role as refuges for wildlife from icy, glacial conditions. Increasing wind speeds, associated with the hole in the ozone layer, had also improved conditions for the wandering albatross. \u201cBecause it\u2019s gotten windier they\u2019re able to travel faster, and that means their foraging trips are shorter,\u201d Chown said. \u201cThey\u2019ve become much heavier.\u201d But other forms of human interference linked to increased fishing activity, tourism and scientific programs posed a threat to biodiversity. \u201cPeople have been driving ATVs [all-terrain vehicles] through moss beds, science stations have been dumping their sewage and oil spills have gone underreported,\u201d he said. And the 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection, which states that the region should only be used for scientific and \u201cpeaceful purposes\u201d, had quickly been interpreted as allowing any activity, \u201cas long as it\u2019s not military or a nuclear power plant\u201d. Only 1.5% of the land and less than 10% of the oceans around Antarctica fall under special protection. A long-running proposal to designate the Ross Sea, sometimes called \u201cthe last ocean\u201d of the world because of its pristine condition, as a marine reserve has so far failed to be negotiated by the convention on the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources. Generally, good control measures had prevented the introduction of invasive alien species \u2013 with the notable exception of annual bluegrass, which was quickly outcompeting the only two indigenous flowering plants on the continent: the Antarctic hair grass and Antarctic pearlwort. Chown said protected areas of the Antarctic should match the global Aichi biodiversity targets of 17% of terrestrial and inland water areas and 10% of marine and coastal areas protected by 2020. Achieving this required a dedicated plan for biodiversity conservation, to be implemented by the Antarctic treaty parties. The plan would identify which areas should be protected and how they would be set aside and managed. It would also call for coordinated investigations into the drivers of biodiversity loss, including ocean acidification, extinction risk assessments and studies into genetic diversity for the region. A plan being drafted should be ready by the end of 2016, which would then be presented to all the treaty parties, Chown said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
