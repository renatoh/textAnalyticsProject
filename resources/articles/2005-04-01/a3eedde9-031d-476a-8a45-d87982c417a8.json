Paul Karslake, artist", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2005/apr/17/features.magazine77", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2005/apr/17/features.magazine77", "fields": {"headline": "Introducing...", "bodyText": "Johnny Depp based his Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean on a portrait of Keith Richards that he saw in Richards's house. 'Keith's wife asked me how I saw him,' says Paul Karslake, who painted it. 'I said I've always seen him as a pirate, so I painted him as one with a box of treasure, a ship and a Caribbean moon - then I saw the exact same scene in the film.' Karslake's apprenticeship with his architectural model-maker dad taught him to use an airbrush, a skill which stood him in good stead when he moved out to LA, painting hot rods and Harleys for a living. 'I was hanging out with the rock'n'roll crowd. The English accent helps incredibly. 'I'd turn my hand to anything. I did some racing cars with penguins all over them for Fleetwood Mac, and I painted John Belushi's jacket for the film 1941.' Karslake has painted Dustin Hoffman, Dennis Hopper and, recently, Kate Moss in the arms of her hero Elvis. But his favourite work is the Boeing 727 he painted for British Midland: 'I get a kick knowing there's a huge plane hurtling around with my art on it.' \u00b7 Karslake's latest show is at the Hollywood Arms, London SW3, from 22-28 April (www.harrylangtonart.com)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
