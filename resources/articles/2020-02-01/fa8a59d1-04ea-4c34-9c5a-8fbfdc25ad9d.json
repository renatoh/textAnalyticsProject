Some of us are tightrope walkers, while others live closer to the ground. For most people this changes throughout their life, depending on factors such as age, whether they\u2019re starting a family, taking up a new sport or recovering from an injury or illness. Just as our lives are unique, so are our health insurance needs. Health cover falls into two categories: hospital (for in-hospital accommodation and treatment) and extras (lifestyle and ongoing health benefits). Hospital cover will give you the option to be treated quickly by your doctor of choice as a private patient in hospital, including for elective procedures. Extras cover gives you the ability to claim for other (non-hospital) health services such as buying glasses, seeing a physio, or getting your teeth professionally cleaned. More than half of us choose to include extras cover in our health lifestyle. But do you really know what you\u2019re buying? We have taken out some of the guesswork to help you choose the right fund. Your policy is nearly as old as you Many Australians transition from their parents\u2019 family policy to their own cover with the same insurer. While it can be helpful to stick with what you know, it also means you might not be getting the optimum features or best price to suit your lifestyle. Take the opportunity to revisit your policy and see what else is out there. You\u2019re about to turn 31 After you turn 31, you need to sign up for health insurance before the following 1 July (called your \u201cbase day\u201d) or you will pay more for hospital premiums later on. It\u2019s called Lifetime Health Cover loading, and it adds 2% to your hospital cover premium for every extra year you do not have cover. You need a policy to support your lifestyle Let\u2019s say you\u2019re in your late 30s, you\u2019ve got a big dog that needs multiple runs a day, and on weekends you\u2019re training for a fun run with your mates. At the same time, your eyes are a bit dodgy and you\u2019ve been meaning to get that mild toothache checked. Your cover should reflect the kind of services you might need: dental, optical, remedial massage and physio, for example. You want cover for pre-existing conditions When you first take out a policy, it will likely be subject to waiting periods for health conditions you already know about. All hospital cover waiting periods are set by the Australian government, and your health fund sets the rest \u2013 usually between two and 12 months. Depending on the level of your hospital cover, you WILL be covered for pre-existing conditions after a waiting period. If you\u2019re switching to a new provider and you have already served that waiting period for the same hospital service, government legislation states you will NOT have to wait again. You\u2019re going into hospital From 1 April, all hospital insurance policies will fall into either Gold, Silver, Bronze or Basic product tiers. Each of the four tiers has a minimum level of benefit, with Basic the lowest, and Gold the highest. Gold hospital provides the same top cover for all funds, making comparison easy. However, for other hospital cover levels, it is very important to check each fund for what hospital treatments are, and are not, covered under each policy. Make sure you are also clear about any potential exclusions, restrictions, co-payments or excesses. When selecting non-Gold hospital cover, ensure you fully understand the risks you are taking by being informed on what you are NOT covered for. You want an insurer that puts its customers first Some people go straight for the big for-profit funds - we know their names and we\u2019ve seen them on TV. But there is also an alternative worth considering. Members Health funds come in many shapes and sizes but share one important and overriding characteristic: they all put the health of their members before profits. And no matter how big or small they might be, or how far or wide you might roam, all Members Health funds are connected to an Australia-wide network of services. If you want smaller-fund customer service, you will still benefit from access to nationwide hospital and extras. Plus, because they\u2019re run for members, their priorities are different. You may find they have time to take a more personalised approach, getting you the right policy, not the most expensive one. You\u2019re starting a family More basic policies don\u2019t always cover obstetrics and maternity services, and those that do often have a 12-month waiting period. If you\u2019re thinking about making a smaller version of you, make sure you tweak your health cover well in advance, so you can be confident you\u2019ll be covered in time. The kids have moved out Insuring a whole family often means there are lots of bases to cover. Once your children move to their own policies, take a look at your level of cover and reset it to ensure you\u2019re covered for what you need, and not paying for anything you don\u2019t. You could even use the money you save to treat yourself to a few extra remedial massages. Your job has specific health considerations As well as general health insurance providers, Australia has a number of industry-based funds in which membership is limited to people connected to certain occupations. Even if you think you\u2019re not directly linked, it is definitely worth taking the time to check. In most cases, families, past and present employees, franchisees, contractors or industry-based students are eligible to join. There are also great funds that are open to everyone and run out of regional Australia. They span from southern Tasmania to northern Queensland and across to Western Australia, and really understand their local communities while providing comprehensive national coverage. You\u2019re not sure what you need Matthew Koce, CEO of Members Health, says it\u2019s important consumers look carefully at what they\u2019re insured for. \u201cYou don\u2019t want a nasty surprise when you need to claim and find you\u2019re not covered,\u201d he says. Consumers should pay close attention to waiting periods, partial cover on extras, exclusions, excesses and co-payments. \u201cIt can get complicated, so to keep things simple, ask yourself this question: \u2018Is my health fund a not-for-profit or part of a not-for-profit group?\u2019 If it\u2019s not, then ask yourself: \u2018Do I trust my for-profit fund to put me first?\u2019\u201d With so many options available, it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed. Start by learning more about what\u2019s available through a network such as Members Health, review the options, and speak to someone who can help you make sure you\u2019re on the right track. Someone who genuinely puts your interests first.
