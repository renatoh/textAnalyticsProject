The identity of the potential investors remains undisclosed and with opinion in the boardroom divided even over the viability of Kia Joorabchian's consortium, regime change in east London currently seems unlikely. The seriousness of the rival bid is likely to be called into question. Normally when a stock market-listed company enters into an offer period - as West Ham did last month when Joorabchian's interest became known - competitor consortia make themselves public so as to prevent the deal being swiftly concluded. However there was no discussion of the putative second bid at Wednesday's board meeting, which was attended by Martin Cearns and Charles Warner, who together with the club's chairman Terence Brown represent 98% of the shares in issue. The mystery has left observers guessing as to the identity of the second consortium's backers. Michael Tabor, the east-end-born racing magnate, was predictably linked with the development but if he is interested in a move for West Ham - which would require a \u00a370m investment to keep pace with Joorabchian's supposed package - he has kept this from his close associates. One said yesterday: \"This rumour circulates from time to time; I suspect I would have heard if there was anything in it.\" Tony Cottee, the former West Ham player, had signalled his desire for exploratory talks some months ago but whether he is stepping up is unknown. Just how long it will take to smoke out the various parties remains in the hands of the City authorities. There has been no \"put up or shut up\" demand to Joorabchian from the Takeover Panel though the City is likely to grow as frustrated as West Ham fans patently are at the opacity of his position. Joorabchian's investment interest last year placed the club in a two-month long offer period before he withdrew his incomplete approach. With that situation relatively fresh in the memory it is unthinkable that the Takeover Panel will allow shareholders' current state of uncertainty to drag on indefinitely."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
