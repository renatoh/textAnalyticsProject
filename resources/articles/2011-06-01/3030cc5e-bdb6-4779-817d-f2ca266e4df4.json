We don't know if our correspondent has been riffling through the album racks in Noord-Holland, but he's uncovered a gem with this. The artistic collaboration between FC Volendam and Radio Veronica resulted in this love child in 1973, the same year that \"The Other Orange\" became the first Eerste Divisie side to tie up a sponsorship deal \u2013 with the offshore pirate radio station Veronica. They put a large V on their shirts that season, claiming to get around the objections of the KNVB that the V stood for Volendam, and released a compilation album of the station's local favourites with a team picture on the cover, including the goalkeeper wearing a Selwyn Froggitt bobble hat. Featured artists numbered the soft-rocking sounds of the Cats, George Baker Selection, Tee-Set, Continental Uptight Band and Dizzy Man's Band. It didn't do much for Volendam's promotion charge, however, the club dropping two places to eighth after 1972-73's sixth-placed finish in the Dutch second division. Our own research has picked up Ace's debut LP Five-a-Side, featuring a picture of the Liverpool crowd with Paul Carrack and Co stuck on top waving blue and white scarves. Moving off topic to the far more popular subject of footballers as opposed to teams on album or singles covers, and discounting compilation albums or we would be inundated with Cherry Red's catalogue of football-themed CDs, John Dodsworth nominates Oasis's Definitely Maybe with its contrasting images of Manchester City's Rodney Marsh and United's George Best. Simon Warner, of the University of Leeds's school of music, notes that Best makes a third appearance after the Wedding Present and Oasis on Paul Weller's Stanley Road, in a portrait by Sir Peter Blake. \"I understand Weller had originally wanted Charlie Cooke on the sleeve,\" writes Simon. That fits with Weller's outing of himself as a boyhood Chelsea fan. \"Charlie Cooke, Peter Osgood, that lot,\" he recalled in 1993 when asked about his seemingly unlikely affection for football. \"But I haven't been down there for 20 years.\" There's also a Chelsea programme in the book rack on the front cover of the Style Council's Our Favourite Shop. Blake crops up again with his montage on the cover of the Beatles' Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band where Liverpool's Albert Stubbins stands between HC Westerman and Lahiri Mahasaya. John Lennon was reportedly responsible for his selection as he was for the shout out to Matt Busby, here. Back to Paul White who brings us news of Weezer's love for the USA team and Andrew Shillito who points out Ash's Kung Fu features a famous kick by Eric Cantona. And finally, Gerry Moran remembers that the Undertones' My Perfect Cousin has \"a Subbuteo figure in the colours of their favourite team, Derry City\". More inch-high plastic men references come courtesy of Steve Roberts: \"On Peter Hammill's 1973 album Chameleon in the Shadow of the Night, within the gatefold sleeve reference is made to: 'ANCILLARIES \u2026 and Subbutio [sic] Poland 3 Scotland 2.'\" Any more? Let us know at the usual address. NATURAL BORN NO2s \"To help settle a discussion with some friends,\" asks Alex Woolhouse, \"could you answer whether a manager has ever left his role to become an assistant at another club? There are rumours that Colin Calderwood is to leave Hibernian to become Steve McClaren's assistant at Nottingham Forest. Also, has a manager ever returned to a club he was fired from to become an assistant? The answer is yes to both questions, Alex. Martin Jol left his position as RKC Waalwijk's manager in 2004 to move to Tottenham as Jacques Santini's assistant and then succeeded his boss after only 13 games. Ten years earlier Viv Anderson left Barnsley after only one season as player-manager to become No2 to Bryan Robson at Middlesbrough. Wigan lost John Deehan in 1997 when he joined up with Steve Bruce at Sheffield United but resigned after only one season and one closer to home for Calderwood is his own assistant, Derek Adams, who resigned as Ross County's manager after three years in the post to help Calderwood at Easter Road. The second part of the question had the current incumbent of the Knowledge's vast shoes watering at the mouth because it can reference Leeds United without needing to get the shoehorn out. Eddie Gray managed the club from 1982-85, was sacked rather unfairly having built a promising side featuring John Sheridan, Ian Snodin, Scott Sellars, Terry Phelan and Andy Linighan, but returned as a youth coach under Howard Wilkinson in 1995, becoming assistant manager to David O'Leary in 1998. He stayed for five years in that role before being made redundant in cost-cutting measures under Peter Reid in the summer of 2003 but returned in November of that year as caretaker manager for the rest of Leeds's relegation season. Elsewhere, Colin Harvey succeeded his fellow member of Goodison's Holy Trinity in 1987 when Howard Kendall left to manage Athletic Bilbao. Harvey was sacked on 31 October 1990 and here, Norman Whiteside takes up the story: \"When Colin Harvey was fired by Everton I immediately rang him to tell him how sorry I was and to thank him for taking me to Goodison. The next week he turned up in his new role as assistant manager to Howard Kendall so it worked out that I had made the best possible political move the week before without having the slightest inkling how things would unfold.\" Harvey resumed his former job as Kendall's assistant for three more years until 1993. We are sure there are more examples out there \u2026 over to you. THAT'S THE LAST WE'LL SEE OF THEM THIS SEASON \"In researching the Everton 1965-66 season, I noticed that they played Sheffield Wednesday in the league in games two and four so had fulfilled their home and away fixtures with each other before the end of August,\" notes Conan Jal. \"Was this a common occurrence or a freak fixture rarity?\" John Chapman has this answer for you, Conan: \"For many years home-and-away midweek fixtures were scheduled for the first and second weeks of the season, and they would sometimes both occur in August, depending on the date the season started. \"In 1947 Arsenal played Charlton on the first two Wednesdays of the season, 27 August and 3 September, but the season had only begun on 23 August. The 1949-50 season began on 20 August, so Arsenal's two games v Chelsea were both in August. The earliest date (that I can find) on which two clubs played their second fixture is 19 August 1969, when Arsenal played Leeds for the second time. The 1969-70 season began on 9 August.\" It was the same for all First Division clubs that year, Conan. Liverpool fulfilled their league fixtures against Manchester City on 20 August, Everton and Manchester United played for a second time on 19 August, ditto Tottenham and Burnley; Wolves and Southampton did it a day later as did Newcastle and Sheffield Wednesday. WHY 'A' ALWAYS COMES BEFORE 'B' \"Have any team's B team ever won promotion to the same division as the real team (but not taken it),\" asks Adam O'Plum Jr. \"Same for relegations.\" The short answer, Adam, is yes, but even if they had wanted to take the opportunity, they would have been thwarted. Our correspondent Nokhodi puts some meat on those bones: \"In the 2007-08 season of Iran's Azadegan League (the second tier), Sepahan Novin were promoted to the Persian Gulf Cup (Iran's Premier or Pro League) after the play-offs. \"Sepahan Novin are the reserve team of Sepahan FC. Sepahan Novin actually wanted to participate in the Persian Gulf Cup the next season but this was rejected by the Iranian football federation. The IFF ruled that both clubs are part of the same organisation. \"Sepahan Novin changed their board of directors to try and prove that they were not part of Sepahan, but again they were rejected. In the end Sepahan Novin were replaced in Iran's top flight by Foolad FC.\" And here's Lee Richardson with the policy in Spain: \"A club can't have both their A and B teams in the same division. According to the Spanish FA, the main principle is that two A and B teams can't play in the same category, nor can the B team play above the A team. \"For example if Villarreal B finish in a promotion position in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n: they won't be promoted, as Villarreal (A) are already in the Primera. Thus, the following team on the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n table will be promoted to the Primera. This happened in 1984 with Real Madrid and Castilla (their B team). \"If Villarreal (A) are relegated to the Segunda. Villarreal B will be also relegated to the lower category (named Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B), as they can't play in the same category as their 'father' side. This could give rise to the extreme and frustrating scenario of the B team finishing top of the second division table but having to be relegated to the third tier if the A team was relegated from the top flight.\" KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \"After Wayne Rooney's recent sending-off for a sarcastic gesture, are there any other examples of sardonic play being punished?\" wondered John Thompson in 2005. There are a fair few, John, arguably the most famous of which was given to a regular guest of the Knowledge pages: one Paul Gascoigne. While playing for Rangers in the 7-0 rout of Hibernian in December, 1995, Gazza was jogging back towards the halfway line at a goal-kick. Spotting that rookie referee Dougie Smith had dropped his yellow card, Gascoigne picked it up, before cheekily waving it at the official \u2013 who waved it right back in his face. The booking took the jovial Geordie over the disciplinary maximum points, earning him a two-match ban. As former Scottish referee David Syme said: \"If it had happened to me, I'd have p***** myself laughing, patted him on the backside and told him to run along.\" Another to fall foul of a humourless official was Crystal Palace midfielder Joonas Kolkka last season. During the 3-2 defeat at Liverpool, the Finn grew tired of what he perceived to be Milan Baros's propensity for going down with a bout of play-acting. After one such incident, he attempted to make his point by theatrically throwing himself to the floor in front of referee Phil Dowd. End result: Kolkka booked and Baros scoring from the resultant free-kick. If Kolkka's caper was at least inventive, Rooney's clap has already proved imitable. Portsmouth manager Alain Perrin was fortunate to avoid punishment after applauding the officials' performance at Bolton recently, though Real Betis's Ricardo Oliveira wasn't so lucky. Only last month, his insincere clapping upon being booked against Barcelona swiftly saw him receive his marching orders. \"A similar case [of sorts \u2013 Knowledge Ed] was when Dino Baggio was sent off in 2000 during a match between his club, Parma, and Juventus,\" recalls Nick Walmsley. \"He'd already received his marching orders for some typical piece of midfield hacking, whereupon he spat at the referee and gestured at the official by rubbing his thumb and forefinger together, meaning he thought the ref was on the take. Baggio was subsequently dropped from the national squad for their next fixture. Oh, and I think he was also fined.\" Less aggressive, but equally acerbic, has to be Russian international Sergei Kiriakov, or Kiki as he was known. Steve Wilson tells the story: \"In the early 90s Kiki was a fast and phenomenal dribbler for Karlsruhe in the Bundesliga. This brought him to the attention of many a hard-nosed defender, who took advantage of his rather unfair reputation as a diver to mete out some rough treatment. One such example occurred in a cup clash with fourth-division Sandhausen: Kiki burst through, only to be stopped in his tracks by a burly defender almost ripping his shirt off. He turned around, removed his shirt and offered it to the defender, only to receive his second yellow and his marching orders.\" This brings to mind new Real Madrid wunderkid Robinho, who was once booked during his Santos days for humiliating defenders with too many stepovers. In 2002, also in the Brazilian league, Coritiba striker Jab\u00e1 was cautioned for dummying and dribbling; the referee claimed he was provoking opponents. Meanwhile, a top-flight game had to be abandoned in the final minute when a player was hounded off the field by opponents after a blas\u00e9 spell of playing keepy-uppy. And staying in South America, Daniel Tunnard remembers the Copa Libertadores semi-final between River Plate and Boca Juniors in 2004: \"In the second leg, Boca's Carlos Tevez scored in the 85th minute and celebrated by performing the sardonic chicken dance, not one favoured by River fans as the team are called 'Gallinas' ('chickens') by other fans, for always choking at the last minute. Tevez walked, but Boca still triumphed on penalties.\" CAN YOU HELP? \"With Roberto Carlos now turning out for Russian Premier League outfit Anzhi Makhachkala (founded 1991), it got me wondering whether any other high-profile professional footballers have played for clubs that didn't exist when they began their professional careers (Roberto Carlos made his debut in 1990)?\" asks Alex Tucker. \"The whole of the 1965 Liverpool team (including reserve) who beat Leeds in the FA Cup final are still alive,\" notes Frank Chart. \"Is this the oldest Cup-winning team still alive? Are there any other examples of a whole team showing such longevity?\" \"Nottingham Forest recently appointed Steve McClaren as their new manager even though he once played for, and was assistant manager of, their arch-rivals Derby County,\" writes Jon Hallam. \"He replaced Billy Davies, who had previously managed Derby County. Derby's current manager is Nigel Clough, who played for Nottingham Forest and is the son of the late Brian Clough who managed both clubs. Several of the players that won the league with Derby also won the league with Forest. Several of both teams current squads have played for both clubs. Are there any other two clubs in Britain that more players and managers have worked for both of?\" More on a musical bent from Brian Buckley: \"Following on from both the football-inspired band names and football-inspired album covers, can we complete the circle and ask for footballers mentioned in songs? And yes, this is a thinly veiled attempt to shoehorn Los Campesinos' line from All Your Kayfabe Friends: 'You asked if I'd be anyone from history, fact or fiction, dead or alive. I said I'd be Tony Cascarino circa 1995' into the Knowledge. \"Sir Alex Ferguson once fined Aberdeen's John Hewitt for having the temerity to overtake his manager on a public road,\" writes Christian McKenzie. \"Is that the most ridiculous reason for a fine in football?\" Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
