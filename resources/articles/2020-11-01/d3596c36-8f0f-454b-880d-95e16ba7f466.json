It was eight months ago that she won all those awards \u2013 that\u2019s a long time in football \u2013 and now this camp has been her best camp so far.\u201d England, who was named PFA player of the year for her 21 goals in the 2019-20 season, has struggled to maintain her place in Chelsea\u2019s starting XI after an achilles injury picked up on international duty at the end of last season, a ruptured appendix just before pre-season and an eye injury on her return to training hampered her return. She has appeared in each of the Blues\u2019 six WSL games but only has two full 90-minute matches under her belt. After Chelsea\u2019s 4-0 defeat of Everton on 8 November, in which England scored twice, Hayes similarly challenged the striker to raise her game. \u201cI was happy with her today, but my job is to win games, not to make my players happy. It\u2019s up to Beth to make sure it is the start of another run of fantastic games,\u201d she said. Neville praised England for looking sharp but warned that the forward had a lot of work to do to dislodge White, who was the bronze boot winner at the2019 World Cup. \u201cEllen White\u2019s still my first-choice centre-forward,\u201d he said. \u201cBeth England\u2019s still got to keep improving, still got to keep challenging to become the number one striker. \u201cEllen has set the bar really high and Beth set the bar really high last season. She came into [the England set up], she\u2019s now getting used to the environment, she\u2019s feeling more comfortable. Now I want to see her perform at that top level. There\u2019s a big difference at the top, top level in performances.\u201d The Arsenal defender Leah Williamson, who has played for England at every level, described the striker as a \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d for not having made the same journey through the national team\u2019s youth ranks and increasing the competitiveness as a result. \u201cA lot of the newer girls are like that, but I think Beth\u2019s achieved so much at club [level] that she\u2019s bringing that competitiveness in. She\u2019s here to stake a claim for a place in the team. That drives you on and drives everyone else on \u2013 especially her direct competition. I think you\u2019re seeing the best of both of them because of an attitude that Beth\u2019s brought in. She\u2019s a really positive person, so she\u2019s always looking to bring that and improve herself.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
