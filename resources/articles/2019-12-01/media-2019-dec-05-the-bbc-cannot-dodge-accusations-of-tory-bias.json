Put simply, the BBC tends to be more sympathetic to the status quo and the government of the day than political change. Yet behind all that lies the hard work of thousands of professional BBC employees out there reporting and producing news on a wide range of matters that the printed media no longer often does. As with the gender pay gap at the BBC, perhaps it\u2019s time for those at Broadcasting House to listen more to their employees and their trade unions and less to the politicians of the moment. Keith Flett London \u2022 Fran Unsworth, the BBC\u2019s director of news and current affairs, writes: \u201cImpartiality is precious to us. We\u2019ll protect it\u201d (Journal, 4 December). To claim that the rightwing bias catalogued by Peter Oborne was \u201ca couple of editorial mistakes\u201d is frankly risible. Her argument that \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d are in vogue just will not wash. I note that her defence of the BBC\u2019s news coverage concentrates on the few weeks of this general election campaign, but I have observed rightwing bias in a number of current affairs programmes for many years. And we all remember Steve Bell\u2019s brilliant IF strip highlighting rightwing bias on the Radio 4 \u201cToady\u201d programme, which featured Nick Robinson. Last Sunday the BBC did a U-turn and allowed Boris Johnson to appear on the Andrew Marr show, claiming it was in the public interest. Marr lost control of the interview and the only interest served was that of the Conservative party. If Unsworth wants to salvage some of the BBC\u2019s tattered reputation she needs to ensure that the promised interview between Andrew Neil and Boris Johnson takes place before the general election; otherwise the accusation of Tory bias will be reinforced. Geoffrey Carpenter Worthing, West Sussex \u2022 Fran Unsworth seeks to justify serious flaws in reporting at the BBC with bluster at a highly critical time in our politics. She cites three instances of error \u2013 all of which favoured the prime minister. First, in the excellent Question Time leaders\u2019 debate, there was mocking laughter at the response of Boris Johnson to a question about trustworthiness. This was later edited out of footage for a lunchtime news bulletin. A \u201cclumsy one-second edit\u201d, she says. Second, coverage of the cenotaph remembrance service where the PM made a mistake laying a wreath and looked foolish was replaced by archive footage of him at the 2016 service on BBC Breakfast. We are \u201cfanciful\u201d to consider this significant, she says. Third, the inability of the corporation to ensure that all the party leaders are interviewed by Andrew Neil before next week\u2019s election in order \u201cto be impartial\u201d. Neil exposed flaws in all the party leaders\u2019 reasoning with corresponding headlines in the press the next day. Why has the PM not been interviewed? Unsworth says \u201cthe logistics are highly complex\u201d. Not good enough from our public service provider. Nancy Hardy Eastergate, West Sussex \u2022 I take issue with what Fran Unsworth wrote in claiming impartiality at the BBC. To my mind, she is making the mistake of equating quantity with quality. If there are many hours of programming but without rigorous challenging of politicians and political statements then the BBC becomes part of the propaganda machine. It is falling behind Channel 4 in the quality of its interviewing. Part of the defence is that there is information produced by the BBC online. On checking both the Policy Guide and Reality Check which Unsworth cites, I was less than impressed. The analysis of the Conservative top priorities lists 50,000 more nurses and 20,000 more police officers \u2013 both discredited claims. This is not a simple editorial mistake. Need one say more about our diminishing trust in the BBC? Stephen Hawkins Edinburgh \u2022 Fran Unsworth seemingly derives satisfaction from the fact that the BBC is criticised by both left and right in \u201calmost equal volumes\u201d. But this is due to the fact that the BBC overrepresents the centre at the expense of both left and right. This is conveyed, for example, by BBC political journalists\u2019 frequent use of the word \u201cmoderate\u201d, with its overtone of approval, to describe those in the centre of politics. This was fine when the centre embodied a national consensus. But at a time of political polarisation, the BBC and other public service broadcasters need to widen their ideological lens if they are to fulfil Unsworth\u2019s vision of seeking \u201cto represent the nation in its entirety\u201d. Prof James Curran Goldsmiths, University of London \u2022 In 1984, I was appointed head of the BBC Bristol Network Production Centre. It was the time of the miners\u2019 strike. Every morning we received a shoal of letters complaining about the BBC\u2019s coverage. They fell into two broad categories: those who thought the BBC was a lackey of the rightwing establishment, and those who thought it was a subversive, lefty organisation. Every morning, we would sort the letters into two piles. And every morning, the piles were exactly the same height. These were people who had been watching exactly the same programmes. I rest my case.
