Tomorrow, new laws shackling the media come into force. They have attracted little attention, but their purpose is simple: for the first time the courts will be able to compel someone not involved in a criminal trial to pay all or part of its costs, which could run to millions of pounds. Previously, only the parties to a case or their lawyers could be hit. The changes, which come into force via an amendment to the Courts Act 2003, will have serious implications for news organisations reporting criminal proceedings and could place real constraints on press freedom. How and why has this come about? The legislation was inspired by the collapse of the Woodgate and Bowyer prosecution (cost: \u00a31 million) in which a retrial was ordered as a result of an article in the Sunday Mirror . The editor of the newspaper, Colin Myler, resigned. It did not stop there: the publisher was fined \u00a375,000 and ordered to pay \u00a3100,000 in legal costs. The weapon used against the media in the Leeds footballers' case was contempt of court. The Attorney-General prosecutes for contempt if he considers a report has caused a substantial risk of serious prejudice to the course of justice. The law of contempt is taken very seriously by journalists and publishers and the consequences of breaking it are grave, extending not just to huge fines and costs but also to imprisonment. The law has to be tough because it protects a serious matter: the conduct of criminal trials on which individual freedom and justice depend. But while the law of contempt is a tough one at least its meaning is clear. The same cannot be said of the new regulations or their consequences. While prosecutions for contempt can only be brought by the Attorney-General, there is no independent safeguard under the new regulations. A trial judge will be free to order a third party, such as a news organisation, to pay the entire cost of a collapsed trial if he thinks there has been serious misconduct. Contempt of court is now irrelevant, unless you want to send an editor to prison. Consider what might have happened to the Sunday Mirror under the new regime. Forget boring old contempt and the Attorney-General: the trial judge could have found serious misconduct (whatever that is) and ordered the entire costs of the first trial to be paid by the newspaper. The newspaper would, of course, have had an opportunity to be heard, as the regulations say the court must allow a third party to make representations, and it would also have had a right of appeal, although the chances of a successful appeal would have been slim. The position would be even worse for a story that amounted to misconduct but was not in contempt: no liability under the old law; a fine of millions under the new. Does this matter? Is it disproportionate for greater penalties to be imposed for misconduct than for contempt of court? If you care about the open reporting of criminal trials and restrictions on the media, the answer must be 'yes'. The effect of the new regulations will not be to prevent miscarriages of justice (the evil guarded against by proceedings for contempt of court) but to limit court reporting. This point was picked up when the regulations were debated in parliament. The Newspaper Society and the Fleet Street Lawyers wanted the Attorney-General's consent for any proceedings. No doubt both bodies had in mind the frequency with which the lower courts wrongly restrict the reporting of criminal trials. Their concerns were rejected with the argument that it would not be necessary, or helpful, to drag the Attorney-General into the dull and thorny area of costs - he should be saved for more serious matters such as contempt and prison. This is a sly and disingenuous argument. Costs' sanctions bite hard. Where costs' penalties may run into millions, freedom of expression begins to look expensive not only to a publisher but also to its insurers. The chilling effect of million-pound penalties is obvious. There are special dangers here, not least because the consequences of the regulations have hardly been discussed. In a press release accompanying the announcement of changes to the law, the government gave examples of trials that have collapsed 'due to serious misconduct by a third party'. The first was prejudicial media reporting; the other two were misbehaviour by a juror and intimidation of a jury, acts of extreme recklessness and criminal intent. All media organisations are careful to avoid contempt of court: the Sunday Mirror story was a hideous mistake. Is it right to bracket inaccurate media coverage with jury nobbling and to impose the same punishment for a mistake as for a deliberate or reckless attempt to pervert the course of justice? The taint by association is clear and harmful. Historically the courts have recognised the principles of open justice and accepted that accurate reporting of criminal trials is important for society at large. During the last few years there has been a shift away from that starting point, mainly because of the stifling effect of anti-terrorism legislation on traditional liberties, whether in terms of trial process or open justice. The costs' regulations are another manifestation of this illiberal change. They should remind us that self-censorship imposed through financial fear can be more severe than direct government control.
