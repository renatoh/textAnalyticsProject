This is a handsome bonus for the jockey, who was one of three arrested in January, 1998 in connection with the alleged doping of two horses the previous year and other incidents of race-fixing. As a result, his riding licence was temporarily suspended until three months later when he was released and told he would have no further questions to answer. \"It's the ultimate victory winning a National,\" says Aspell, who has ridden 29 winners this season that has earned more than \u00a3225,000 in prize-money. \"Only those jockeys associated with top-class horses will win a Gold Cup, but you have the chance to win a National on a good horse like Supreme Glory.\" Things could have been so different for Aspell if that race-fixing case had not disintegrated in spectacular and, for the racing industry, embarrassing fashion. Aspell was arrested with colleagues Jamie Osborne and Dean Gallagher purely, it seems, because the trio had been involved in races where two horses - Lively Knight and Avanti Express - had tested positive for the prohibited fast-acting tranquilliser Acetylpromazine (ACP) revealed in metabolites. Aspell says: \"I was devastated when I had my licence taken away. I am still very angry about the whole thing. To this day I've never been given any explanation why I was arrested. It has all been swept under the carpet. It was just badly handled. \"Fortunately, it has not been detrimental to my career. No-one in racing has ever said anything bad to me about the ordeal I was put through and people have been very supportive, not least Pat Murphy and Chris Moorsom, who, respectively, train and own Supreme Glory. \"They have been very loyal, as have other trainers like Josh Gifford, Richard Rowe, Lucy Wadham and Mark Pitman, and I am now having my best season. \"The Grand National is the biggest race in the world and punters can rest assured that I will be trying for my life to win it.\" Murphy has nothing but praise for Aspell. He says: \"Leighton is a supreme horseman first and a very good jockey second. He cares and looks after his horses. \"He is a very good team member and will school and ride work when he is asked to do so. He is always on call. He also rides with his head and uses it when he talks after a race. I've used him since he was a 5lb claimer and will continue to do so.\" Aspell knows Supreme Glory well, having ridden him on 14 of his 15 starts. They first teamed up at Towcester two years ago and were far from disgraced when finishing second in a novice chase. \"I came back and said he was a nice horse then,\" Aspell recalls. \"He went to Fontwell after that and that's when we found out he didn't like going right-handed. He needs a stamina test on a left-handed.\" Ideal conditions came at Chepstow before Christmas, when Aspell and Murphy enjoyed their biggest success after Supreme Glory galloped to a famous victory in the Welsh National. Absent since then, Supreme Glory is due to be back in action in the Aon Chase at Newbury on Saturday, where he will face a host of Gold Cup hopes. Winning would be a bonus, but the idea is to have the perfect preparation for Liverpool. Aspell adds: \"Regardless of where he finishes, it will get him ready for Aintree. He's just what is needed for the National - he's good, jumps safely and economically and stays well. I just hope one or two of the Gold Cup horses run as Supreme Glory is best off a low weight against better animals rather than giving weight to lesser rivals.\" If Aspell had a hard time back in the late 1990s, then that is nothing to the well-documented horror Murphy endured last year. A mishap on the gallops left the handler with two broken wrists and a smashed elbow. Then, there was the devastating loss of his 14-year-old daughter Melissa in a road accident and the break-up of his marriage. And away from his personal trauma, Murphy also bid farewell to his star chaser Shooting Light, who was moved to Martin Pipe. The horse is now a leading hope for the Gold Cup at Cheltenham in March and could take on Supreme Glory in the Aon. Few, then, would begrudge the popular Aspell and amiable Murphy success in the Grand National. Their story - from desperate lows to an unforgettable high - really would be the ultimate tale which so often lies behind each National victory at Aintree. \u00b7 The weights for the Martell Grand National are announced today and will be published in tomorrow's Guardian. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
