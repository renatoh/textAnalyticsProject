After first-half goals by Christian Vieri and Jiri Stajner, the Empoli striker Antonio Di Natale scored his first goal for Italy in the 86th minute, converting a precise header from beyond the penalty spot. Rosicky then scored with a curving long shot. In the 14th minute, Vieri controlled a cross from the left from the Juventus striker Alessandro Del Piero and banged a header off the post. The ball bounced back out to Del Piero, who guided the ball towards the near post. The Czech goalkeeper Jaromir Blazek failed to gain control and Vieri appeared to score with his elbow . Karel Poborsky played in his 91st international to beat Zdenek Nehoda's 16-year record. Israel marked their first home international for almost a year with a 6-0 win over Azerbaijan in Tel-Aviv while Palestine opened their World Cup qualifying campaign with an 8-0 thrashing of Taiwan in Qatar."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
