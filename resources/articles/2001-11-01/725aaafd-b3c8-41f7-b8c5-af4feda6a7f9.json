The Yorkshire club have clashed so frequently with the South African FA over whether their defender should appear in internationals that they would not risk repeating the experience. Radebe has been out of action since March with a knee ligament injury, a problem Leeds claim is exacerbated by the international travel involved whenever he is asked to join his national squad. \"Two years ago we sent a medical report to South Africa about his knee, but he kept getting called up,\" O'Leary said in the Cape Argus, a South African newspaper. \"Lucas was in a catch-22 situation - he loves playing for his country, he wanted to play all the games. \"I'd love a few more footballers like Lucas, but until the South African Football Association get their act together my chairman won't take one. It's all very well finding players like Lucas but it's not much good to Leeds when they go missing so often.\" The Barcelona coach Carles Rexach has rounded on his team after their embarrassing exit from the King's Cup at the hands of third division Figueres. A goal from Kali Garrido one minute into extra-time ensured a 1-0 defeat and triggered wild celebrations at the humble Catalan club. \"We made fools of ourselves and when you do that you lose,\" Rexach said. \"We did everything badly. The players weren't up to the job and I am very angry about it. Barcelona should win against Figueres or against any team from the third division.\" But yesterday Dani, one of the players involved, disagreed with his manager. \"We did our best,\" he said. \"The coach is as much to blame as we are. He is part of the group trying to win the match. We are as one and every one of us is to blame. \"We had a makeshift team and had players who don't normally play. Figueres played a good match, they won and we must congratulate them.\" Manchester City are giving Charleroi's defensive midfielder Christian N\u00e9gouai a three-day trial while clubs in the Belgian league enjoy a free weekend because of the international games. The 23-year-old was recommended by the former Newcastle defender Philippe Albert. But City's attempt to bring Robert Jarni to Maine Road appears to have hit difficulties, with Kevin Keegan admitting the deal is not looking likely. The 33-year-old has not played for his club, Las Palmas, this season and claims that they still owe him a large amount of money in wages. Aston Villa's new Trinity Road stand will be officially opened by the Prince of Wales on Monday. The Prince will follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, the then Duke of York, who opened the old stand in 1924."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
