Both players sustained injuries on international duty this week, and Cole is also a doubt for Tuesday's Champions League match at Celta Vigo. Gael Clichy will stand in at left-back for Cole, who lasted only 17 minutes of England's draw in Portugal. Edu will be on standby as Gilberto undergoes treatment on the injury he picked up during Brazil's game in Dublin. Reflecting on the fall-out from Wednesday's friendlies, Wenger said, \"Ashley has a stiff back. He came in today and it was very stiff and very inflamed. We believe he will be short for Saturday's game but he might have a chance to play on Tuesday. Gilberto has a bad knock on his ankle but fortunately it is not twisted. We will see how he responds to treatment today and training tomorrow. There is a small possibility for Saturday.\" Thierry Henry and Sol Campbell were withdrawn from international matches this week. Henry missed last weekend's FA Cup victory over Chelsea but Wenger said: \"Thierry should be OK. We pulled Sol out [of the England squad] with a groin problem. We did not want to overload him with games. He is carrying on with that problem but he should be able to play on Saturday.\" Porto's coach Jose Mourinho said yesterday that he turned down an approach from Tottenham about taking over at White Hart Lane in October, but made it plain that he would consider moving to England this summer. Everton midfielder Li Tie will miss the rest of the season with a broken leg sustained on international duty for China . The goalkeeper Steve Simonsen has rejected a new one-year contract at Everton having grown frustrated at his inability to rise to anything other than third-choice at Goodison Park."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
