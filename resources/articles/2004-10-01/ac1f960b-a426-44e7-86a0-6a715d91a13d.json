If the joint ventures goes ahead it could lead to further cooperation between the two groups. Time Out publishes the eponymous London guide and a successful New York sister title, and Elliot is planning further US editions. The magazine is also printed under licence in several other cities. The company prints a Paris Time Out in English and has an office in the French capital, but a French-language equivalent would be the first in a foreign tongue. Time Out is privately owned and Elliot has held talks with several venture capital groups with a view to selling a 15-20 per cent stake in the company but has not found a suitable partner. He would like to secure outside investment to speed up the group's global expansion, but is reluctant to surrender control of the company he founded over 25 years ago. Axel Springer's chairman and chief executive, Mathias Dopfner, wants to acquire assets outside the group's home market. The group, whose titles include broadsheet Die Welt and tabloid Bild, dominates the German newspaper industry and further expansion there is likely to be blocked by the competition authorities. Axel Springer made an unsuccessful bid for the Daily Telegraph and its Sunday sister title earlier this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
