Yesterday HSBC shares dipped 30p to 777p on talk that a profits warning is on the way. According to the rumours the bank has been affected by poor loan growth in Asia - a key market - rising bad debts and sharp downturn in revenues from its investment banking operation, HSBC Securities. The speculation, which also affected rival Standard Chartered, came as two leading investment banks published negative research reports on HSBC. Deutsche Bank, which lowered its rating to \"underperform\", said the company was overvalued given the flat earnings outlook for the next two years, while SG Securities advised its clients to sell and said the shares deserved to trade at 700p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
