When he won the Queen\u2019s Club title in 2013, Murray donated his \u00a373,000 winner\u2019s purse to the Royal Marsden Hospital, who successfully treated his friend, the former doubles player Ross Hutchins, for Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. The tournament , the most prestigious on grass in the leadup to Wimbledon, has since been upgraded to an ATP500 event. The world No1 joins the Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin, who said on Saturday that he would give \u00a350 to the fund for every minute he plays at the European Under-21 Championship in Poland. If Spain, the tournament favourites, reach the final, they will have played five matches and Bellerin\u2019s contribution could be as high as \u00a322,500. The Manchester City midfielder Raheem Sterling has also promised to give \u201ca substantial sum\u201d. Ascot Racecourse is also making a donation of \u00a3100,000 to The British Red Cross UK Solidarity and London Fire Relief Funds and Local Charities, to support those affected. Johnny Weatherby, Chairman of Ascot Racecourse, said: \u201cWe have all been deeply saddened by recent tragic events around the country. At the beginning of this important week for racing, we at Ascot Racecourse wish to pay our respects to the victims and offer support to the families who have been so terribly affected.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
