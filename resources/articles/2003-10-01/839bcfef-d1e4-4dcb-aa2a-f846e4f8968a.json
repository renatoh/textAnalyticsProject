But tourism bosses are so confident in their appeal they have signed up the controversial couple to appear in an advertising campaign aimed at boosting tourism in London. The cash-strapped couple are spearheading a \u00a34m television advertising campaign launched today by VisitLondon, the new body charged with promoting the capital as a tourist destination. Mr Hamilton, who was declared bankrupt in 2001 after losing a libel action against Harrods boss Mohamed al Fayed, appears with his wife Christine in one of four TV adverts aimed at luring visitors back to London. The couple are shown in bed in a bare room, deciding each day which free museum to visit. \"London has over 70 free museums and galleries - perfect if you're a little short at the moment.\" The other three adverts, designed to attract more visitors to London from the rest of the UK and Europe, concentrate on \"clubbing, sightseeing and the theatre,\" the voiceover announces. The TV advertising will be supported by press adverts in the UK in 17 regional newspapers and will be complemented by value offers from commercial partners. A similar press campaign will launch in the key European markets of France and Germany in December. \"This is a huge and exciting step for London. For the first time we have the funding for an image-led campaign which firmly establishes London as the destination with a unique and vast choice of things to see and do,\" said VisitLondon's chief executive, David Campbell. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
