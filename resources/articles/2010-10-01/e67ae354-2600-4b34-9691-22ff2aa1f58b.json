Izzard will play the infamous one-legged pirate in Sky1's new version of Robert Louis Stevenson's tale of 18th-century treasure hunting and skulduggery in the west country and the Caribbean. Production is due to begin next month, with filming in Ireland and Puerto Rico. The two-part, four-hour family drama is to be broadcast at Christmas in 2012. It will be the first live-action adaptation of the novel for British TV since the BBC's version in the 1970s, starring Alfred Burke as Long John Silver. Others who have played him on film and TV include Orson Welles, Charlton Heston, Brian Blessed, Robert Newton and Peter Vaughan. Izzard should be used to limping after running 43 marathons in 51 days around the UK last year for Sport Relief. With his sell-out stand-up shows and subsequent DVD sales, Izzard can afford to pick and choose his TV roles. Last year he appeared in BBC1's take on John Wyndham's science-fiction novel The Day of the Triffids. Izzard also starred in the US con-artist show The Riches, which ran for two series from 2007. One of his most recent public appearances was as the MC at a question and answer session with the new Labour leader, Ed Miliband, at the party's conference last month. Sophie Turner Laing, Sky's managing director of entertainment and news, said: \"We have Treasure Island in production which stars Eddie Izzard, which is really exciting. He doesn't do that much television so we are very excited that he is to play Long John Silver.\" Sky is not renowned for period dramas, but the broadcaster is planning to boost its investment in original drama by 400% between 2009/10 and 2011/12. In a bid to highlight its entertainment credentials, the broadcasterIt is moving Sky1, Sky Living and Sky Atlantic to the top of the Sky Digital electronic programme guide. Sky Atlantic, due to launch early next year, will feature US drama including Mad Men and HBO content such as Martin Scorsese's eagerly-awaited Boardwalk Empire. Turner Laing said Sky1, Sky Living and Sky Atlantic will have slots 106, 107 and 108 \u2013 right after the five main terrestrial channels - so Sky can \"highlight for our customers the best of entertainment pay at the top of the EPG\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
