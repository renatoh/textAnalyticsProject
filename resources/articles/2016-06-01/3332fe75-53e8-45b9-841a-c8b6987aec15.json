McGuire said on his radio show on Monday morning that his comments were in keeping with the tone of the general \u201ctomfoolery\u201d of last Monday\u2019s charity event, the Big Freeze at the G. But Wilson, the Age\u2019s chief AFL football writer, spoke to 3AW Breakfast on Monday morning and said McGuire had crossed a line when joking he would pay money to see her slide into an ice bath \u2013 and even more if she were to \u201cstay under\u201d. \u201cI wasn\u2019t happy about them [the comments],\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI found out about them last Monday night, they were relayed to me by a friend at Channel 9. \u201cI think he\u2019s probably crossed the line and I didn\u2019t like the language. I don\u2019t accept that it was playful banter, I\u2019ve got to say. \u201cIt\u2019s like casual racism, casual violent language might be meant as a joke, but I wonder how many times we have to draw this line in the sand between this sort of language and what is a joke and obviously what is completely unacceptable.\u201d McGuire was contacted about the incident by the AFL\u2019s chief executive, Gillon McLachlan, on Sunday although he denied reports he was told to apologise or resign from his post with the Magpies. He said his comments, which came before the AFL\u2019s White Ribbon weekend, were made in the spirit on the charity event and merely taken the wrong way. \u201cAnything, anything at all that can be seen to promulgate domestic violence is unacceptable. Full stop,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the big issue here. You can argue as much as you like about the tone \u2026 but anything that is seen to promulgate or support \u2013 even in a light-hearted manner \u2013 any form of domestic violence is unacceptable. \u201cThat was the least of anyone\u2019s intention. In fact, it didn\u2019t even cross anyone\u2019s mind. The day \u2013 the Big Freeze at the G \u2013 was based on good humour, sledging each other, tomfoolery. \u201cThe whole thing was about having fun at Gil\u2019s expense, my expense, everyone\u2019s expense. Neale Daniher did the gag with me saying that we\u2019re going to get extra people to push you down and everyone\u2019s hoping you\u2019re not going to get up out of the water. That\u2019s where it was all at \u2013 the fun and stupidity. \u201cHowever, it was clearly banter, but on White Ribbon weekend, we have to be ever-vigilant in stamping out anything that could be misconstrued one iota of supporting the abhorrent act of domestic violence. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ll say there is that it was all done in the spirit of the fun of the day and who would be next going down the slide. Totally unacceptable.\u201d McGuire was on last Monday\u2019s radio segment with North Melbourne president James Brayshaw, journalist Damian Barrett and former players-turned-pundits, Danny Frawley and Wayne Carey. At the time, only Barrett expressed a reticence to join in the \u201cbanter\u201d. Brayshaw and Frawley were also contacted by the AFL on Sunday. Frawley issued a brief apology on the Fox Sports show, Bounce, later in the day and another on Monday morning, when he said he had left a \u201cvery apologetic message\u201d with Wilson. \u201cA lot of people have been affected by it and none more than Caroline Wilson,\u201d he said. \u201cI do take it back. It was in jest but when you read it in isolation it doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d Brayshaw is expected to address the furore in his radio show on Monday afternoon. The AFL on Sunday condemned the episode, saying it \u201chad expressed the strong view to both club presidents and All Australian selector Danny Frawley ... that although seeking to be light-hearted, the language and tenor of the wording could be seen to be supporting violent attitudes or actions against women, and was therefore clearly not appropriate.\u201d Wilson is the first woman to win the AFL\u2019s gold media award and she has won several awards during her career, including the AFL Players Association\u2019s football writer of the year and the AFL Media Association\u2019s most outstanding football writer and most outstanding feature writer. \u201cIn my mind, anyway we\u2019re talking about a colleague of ours who gives as good as she gets,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cShe\u2019s skewered all of us and that\u2019s the tone I was talking in \u2013 that it\u2019d be good to see her going down the slide because she\u2019s given it to all of us over the journey. \u201cI don\u2019t even consider Caroline Wilson other than being a person and being a leading light in football. It was nothing personal. In the context of what we\u2019re fighting for, and that is that violence against women is abhorrent and we have to take the extra steps.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
