The Lambourn trainer has his team in tremendous order and there is no-one riding better than Fitzgerald. Iris Royal (1.55) has blossomed into a first-class chaser this season, completing a hat-trick when beating Risk Accesor by a head in the valuable Tripleprint Gold Cup over course and distance last month with several of today's rivals well behind. Hersov (3.05), who bounced back to form with a victory over hurdles at Sandown, should be suited by the marathon trip of the Miles Gosling Handicap Chase. The eight-year-old won two three-mile chases last season and has bags of stamina and is expected to be even better over longer distances this term. Ambition Royal (3.35), despite running green, was an easy winner on his debut in a bumper at Warwick in November. He will have derived much from that effort and looks the type who could run up a sequence. The Ian Williams' Owners Novice Chase is an intriguing contest, despite only four turning out. French trainer Guillaume Macaire is doubly represented by Golden Flight and Massac, but Martin Pipe's Therealbandit (12.50), a smart hurdler, has taken well to the bigger obstacles and is fancied to give the weight to his rivals for his sixth successive victory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
