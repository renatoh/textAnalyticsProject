The Independent on Sunday reported this weekend that Obama will travel to the UK in April, as part of a trip already including Germany, to lend his support to the campaign against the so-called \u201cBrexit\u201d. The British prime minister, David Cameron, wants Britain to stay in the European Union. The referendum on the question will take place on 23 June. The question of an intervention by Obama has been raised before: in February, Tennessee senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, suggested Obama would \u201creach out\u201d to British voters. Declining to say if he thought the UK leaving the EU would harm US national security, Cruz pegged his argument on a critique of US foreign policy that he gives when out on the stump. He argued that Obama had hurt \u201cour alliances\u201d and \u201charmed our friendships\u201d around the world, and that \u201cour enemies have learned this president is not a credible threat for anything\u201d. The Texas senator also insisted that if elected he would return a bust of Winston Churchill to the Oval Office. George W Bush kept the bust, a loan from the UK, during his time in the White House. Obama did not retain it. Many on the American right have long viewed British EU membership with skepticism. Anti-EU politicians like Nigel Farage and Daniel Hannan have spoken at conservative conferences in the US. On a presidential debate stage in January, Mike Huckabee said: \u201cThe European Union is failure.\u201d However, in the foreign policy community there is a strong consensus that UK membership benefits the US national interest. Cruz made the comments before five crucial presidential primaries on Tuesday. He is the closest competitor to Donald Trump in the Republican field and was campaigning in a state where he claimed his organisation\u2019s polls showed a far closer race than public polling. Cruz has won 370 of the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the GOP nomination, leaving him 90 behind Trump."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
