Cameron congratulated the \"football community\" on the progress made in tackling racism but said there was more to do. \"Campaigns like Show Racism the Red Card and Let's Kick Racism Out of Football have made a real difference. And I know that the Football Association, Premier League and Football League continue to work hard on this,\" he said. \"But of course many of us will have been concerned by recent events. My message is clear. We will not tolerate racism in Britain. It has absolutely no place in our society. And where it exists, we will kick it out.\" Owen Gibson"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
