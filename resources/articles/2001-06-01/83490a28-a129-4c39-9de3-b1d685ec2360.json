Since then, they have given some of the finest lieder recitals of recent years, characterised by an extraordinary fusion of sense, sound and emotion, and by their almost uncanny ability to function as an indivisible unit in which piano and voice have equal weight and intensity. Yet seeing and hearing them together again as part of Brendel's 70th birthday celebrations, it was apparent things weren't quite right. Goerne clearly had some sort of injury, walking on to the platform with a limp and displaying signs of discomfort throughout. The burnished, dark beauty of his voice was unaffected, but there were moments of slippage in his powers of communication, a narrowing of his expressive range. The main work was Schubert's Schwanengesang, the posthumous collection of songs to texts by Rellstab and Heine that forms a meditation on earthly transience before plunging into a world of hallucinatory terror. I was less worried by Goerne's decision to place an interval in the middle of the work than I was by lapses in the dramatic pacing of the sequence as a whole. Schubert, like Shakespeare, offsets tragedy with humour and irony, accentuating the horror of the later songs through the early presence of the snide eroticism of St\u00e4ndchen and the jaunty wit of Abschied. It was here Goerne slipped up. St\u00e4ndchen was unaccountably delivered with bullying ferocity; Abschied was po-faced, hectoring, unfunny. However, the later songs did grip through the sheer expressionistic force of his delivery and the shivery, surreal beauty of Brendel's playing, with the ravaged emotional landscape of Am Meer freezing the blood and Der Doppelg\u00e4nger ending in a shocked silence the audience feared to break with applause. Schwanengesang was prefaced by Beethoven's An die Ferne Geliebte, which, as a totality, was infinitely more successful. Its revolutionary qualities - the cyclic structure, the pre-Wagnerian bifurcation between text and underlying psychology - were never for a moment in doubt, nor was the immaculate accord between the performers. The cycle sometimes silences the singer altogether to replace him with brief piano interludes. Brendel's playing of their rapt, arching phrases took us into a subliminal territory beyond space, time or words."}, "isHosted": false}}}
