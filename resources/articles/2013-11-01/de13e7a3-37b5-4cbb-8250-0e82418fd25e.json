That was quite fun. Sort of. The Later... liveblog is over for another year. See you next time! Finally, someone else that shares my jumper obsession. \"Real live music\" Oh dear. Let's see what Twitter made of it all shall we. Oh, it's over. The crowd aren't really helping are they. Can't some of them just run into the middle for a bit of a jump around? I've been to the studio [CLANG] and there's no security or anything. Mind you, this is from the era when Brandon Flowers grew a rubbish goatee beard and Neil from the Pet Shop Boys said it was the end of their pop phase. He was sort of right wasn't he. Until Stuart Price came along anyway. This is a good single isn't it. Remember, keep an eye out for the drummer's gurn. If Haim have bassface then this is drumgurn. Or something. Right, here we go! Tops off everyone. Oh Jools... That was pleasant enough. Blimey. The second hat of the evening from Denai. And she's switched from guitar to piano for the show, which is probably the biggest shock there will be tonight let's be honest. \"Someone that Plan B has helped produce?\" Not literally. He's kicked a light! JOOLS! He kicked a light! JOOLS! HANG ON. He has one white shoe and one black shoe on! If that isn't messing with the system then what is? Down with you and your matching shoes - let's start an odd shoe revolution! Nice last-song-at-the-indie-disco dancing from the singer there though. That was nice and brief. I haven't heard much of The Orwells before but so far I am a fan of that man's luscious hair. They all look about 14. How old are they? Should they be working after 10pm? Such a nice hat. When is Jools going to ask him what the first album he ever heard was? That was pleasant but forgettable, sorry. I'm sure they're lovely people. See. The best Del Amitri song is of course Always The Last To Know. Where can I get one of Boy George's amazing necklaces from? No wonder he was almost falling over at the end there. Here's a review of Later... so far. This is a rather lovely song that is sort of autobiographical but universal too, which is what all good pop should be. Boy's outfit is ruined slightly by the suit and trainers combo, which has the air of someone who's run out to the shops to get some milk while getting ready for a night out. Oh blimey, Jools has done a Google about birthdays. I've only just noticed that the drummer's in some sort of circular metal contraption, which will hopefully lift up and fly around the studio at the song's end. This performance sort of needs something doesn't it. The song's good but it needs more hands in the air moments. Amazing lights. I love me some lights. I want those ones for my living room. Right, who's got the poppers? This could be an X Factor winner's single. My housemate just said this sounds like M People. Harsh. But perhaps fair. Also, keep an eye out for the drummer's orgasm face as the song builds up. Seriously though, could I pull off a leather waistcoat? Right, here we go. The Killers are here to flog their forthcoming greatest hits, Direct Hits, which as a title sort of ignores their last album which was a bit ropey to be honest. Oh and this is the first from said album and was produced by M83. Let's enjoy it together. And here are those loveable scamps The Orwells trying to contain their excitement. Look out for the sort of knitwear I was banging on about in my intro. So chunky. The other day whoever's in charge of the Later... Twitter account posted a couple of pictures of some of tonight's acts soundchecking. Perhaps these pictures will be of interest to you. Here's Denai Moore wearing a hat and playing a guitar: Also, here's a picture of my sofa to give you an idea of where this is all happening. Not the actual show, obviously. That's in a studio. I am not there. I am on this sofa. Although not in this picture. Chilly isn't it? Hopefully like me you've seen enough fireworks for one evening and are now inside sporting a nice bit of knitwear you dug out of the back of the wardrobe, some comfy slippers and you're on your fourth cup of tea. It's the perfect context in which to enjoy the final episode of Later..., which, in case you didn't know already, is now filmed in Maidstone in Kent. My favourite Maidstone memory (designated hashtag: #maidstonememories) is the time I fell through a bar, Del Boy-style, at Jumpin' Jaks night club. ANYWAY. Who's keeping Jools company this week? The Killers! Las Vegas stalwarts who seem to not really enjoy being in a globe-straddling band anymore but who have a Greatest Hits album coming soon, so here they are. Boy George! One of British pop's most recognisable voices, who's touting a return-to-form album after some 'personal problems'. Chase &amp; Status! Drum'n'bass-obsessed production duo, Saul Milton (Chase) and Will Kennard (Status), whose new album features Major Lazer, Pusha T and disco recluse, Nile Rodgers. Jimmy Webb! American singer-songwriter and composer who's just released his thirteenth album, which features covers of his own songs with some of his famous friends (and the bloke from Del Amitri). The Orwells! Teenage major label punk rockers from Chicago who haven't had a good gig unless someone's had their nose broken. Denai Moore! Of Ghost fame...Oh, no, hang on, that's Demi Moore. Denai is an intense, Plan B-endorsed singer of songs. Here's a video of The Killers on Later... back in 2004 when they were four fresh-faced and excitable young men."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
