Not a good night for the 24-year-old. 5 Phil Jones Failed to shore up the defence and made to look very ordinary by club-mate Fellaini at times. 5 John Stones Only outfield player to start all three games and worrying to see him strapped up after being taken off. 7 Gary Cahill Early clearance off the line spared Pickford\u2019s blushes but most capped player\u2019s experience was not plain. 6 Trent Alexander-Arnold Teenager was industrious down the right wing and goal-line clearance will have given confidence. 7 Eric Dier Started slowly, gave ball away sloppily and did little to suggest he could displace Henderson. 5 Danny Rose Left Januzaj unmarked and when he finally caught up was utterly bamboozled for the goal. 5 Ruben Loftus-Cheek A bright, bustling spark in a rather grey side. A few energetic dribbles and did look to worry Belgians. 7 Fabian Delph Dispossessed on occasion and unlikely to have advanced his cause but not altogether terrible. 5 Jamie Vardy Darting runs and clearly wanted to win but was isolated and offered little end-product. 5 Marcus Rashford Simply had to score when one-on-one with Courtois but keeper was able to tip wide a shot too close to him. 5 Subs Harry Maguire 6 (for Stones ht) and will likely start against Colombia; Danny Welbeck 6 (for Alexander\u2011Arnold 79) finally got his chance to play. Belgium (3-4-2-1) Thibaut Courtois Has yet to have a proper test from Panama, Tunisia or indeed England. But cut a confident figure. 7 Leander Dendoncker A couple of vicious challenges on Rose and was booked after half an hour. 5 Dedryck Boyata Celtic defender coped well when faced with the pacy duo of Vardy and Rashford. 7 Thomas Vermaelen Stayed on despite a nasty cut after clash of heads with Vardy and was an assured presence. 6 Nacer Chadli Good headed clearance from a decent Alexander-Arnold free-kick and did little wrong. 6 Youri Tielemans Fizzing shot from distance after five minutes forced a save but booked for hefty challenge on Rose. 6 Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 An ever assured presence in the middle and a player Gareth Southgate must have looked at enviously. 7 Thorgan Hazard Couple of shots in first half woefully wide of the mark but picked up in second half. 6 Adnan Januzaj Striker who once vaguely entertained the possibility of playing for England produced a peach of a goal. 8 Marouane Fellaini Generally made himself a nuisance and important deflection of goal-bound Welbeck effort. 8 Michy Batshuayi Hit own face with ball when celebrating but one of few Belgians to show obvious attacking intent. 7 Subs Vincent Kompany 6 (for Vermaelen 74): Drew a huge cheer as he came on and offered welcome reinforcement; Dries Mertens 6 (for Januzaj 86).
