The target was 322 and Bangladesh reached it with seven wickets and 8.3 overs to spare. This was a record-breaking performance, Bangladesh\u2019s highest successful run chase in ODI cricket and the second highest \u2013 after Ireland\u2019s triumphant pursuit against England in Bangalore \u2013 in World Cup history. For West Indies it was heartbreaking. Their early defeat of Pakistan raised hopes of a revival in this form of the game but since then they have been frail in body and mind. Here they tried to impose their plan A when defending a substantial total. That failed. And they did not have a plan B. The selection of their side did not permit one. They played five fast bowlers with Gayle as the only spin option. Four of the pacemen were tall right-handers inclined to bang the ball into the pitch. But this did not worry the Bangladesh batsmen a jot. Before Shakib arrived Tamim Iqbal and Soumya Sarkar had added 52 in nine overs and then Bangladesh\u2019s ageless all-rounder soon became the highest runscorer in the tournament. He took control from the moment he arrived at the crease. He knew what to expect and he was intuitively in position to cut and pull against bowlers who seemed to have only one tactic \u2013 to bang the ball into the pitch. Just occasionally he top-edged the hook shot but no West Indian could lay hands on the mis\u2011hits. Tamim was equally adept at combatting the short ball and it took a freakish piece of action to dismiss him. He hit a crisp straight drive back to the bowler, Sheldon Cottrell, who pulled off a heist reminiscent of Roger Harper bowling to Graham Gooch at Lord\u2019s in 1987. Cottrell stuck out his left hand and then threw the ball at the stumps with Tamim out of his crease as he completed the shot. He hit them. Even though Mushfiqur Rahim was caught down the leg side cheaply, Bangladesh could canter to victory thanks to a superb partnership of 189 between Shakib and Litton Das, who was playing his first match of the tournament. Initially Das was content to be a sleeping partner but the introduction of Gayle seemed to energise him. With his form flooding back he hit the hapless Shannon Gabriel for three consecutive sixes. By now West Indies had accepted the inevitability of defeat. Das, who hit the winning runs, had raced to 94 from 69 balls. Afterwards Jason Holder said the target was \u201c30 to 40 runs short\u201d, which means he wanted a score that would have required a record-breaking run chase by a considerable margin. This seemed an odd appraisal designed to counter the haplessness of West Indies in the field and in their selection. It is true that Holder\u2019s team might have scored more. They had to recover from a tortuous start with Gayle stuck at the crease for 12 balls without scoring a run before edging to the keeper. Then the innings was dependent on the solidity of Shai Hope, a minor resurgence by Evin Lewis and some pyrotechnics from Shimron Hetmyer and Holder. Hope hit the ball silkily but often straight to a fielder, although that did not seem to matter so much when the lower order set to work. This did not include any contribution from Andre Russell on a bad day for West Indies\u2019 iconic Jamaicans. He also departed without scoring. Later in the field he could move little better than Gayle as his creaking body rebelled after bowling six painful overs, a sad reflection of West Indies\u2019 standing in this tournament. Bangladesh are now the undisputed leaders of the chasing pack. Next up for them is Australia at Trent Bridge. They will not be taken for granted. \u2022This article was amended on 18 June 2019 to correct a reference to Roger Harper bowling to Graham Gooch at Lord\u2019s in 1988. The match in question took place in 1987."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
