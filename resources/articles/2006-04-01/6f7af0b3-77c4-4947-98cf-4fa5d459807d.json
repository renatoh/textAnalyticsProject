They present people unstitched from the fabric of their lives. A Kind of Alaska (1982) is staged first: a frightening vignette. Deborah is a botched Sleeping Beauty. Unconscious at 16, she awakens 29 years later, a middle-aged woman. A doctor (Niall Buggy) is by her side. Anna Calder-Marshall's Deborah is subtly realised. She is cheerful and lost: her voice swinging from babyish to seasoned as she tries to unscramble time. A Slight Ache (1958) begins as comic pastoral. A husband and wife are having breakfast on the longest day of the year. There is nothing to disturb their peace except for a wasp, which Edward exterminates in a marmalade jar. But Edward has become disturbed by a match-seller waiting by his gate, like destiny. He invites him in - a wordless man, sweating beneath his balaclava. Michael Byrne is excellent as Edward: colonial, garrulous, sadistic. Diana Hardcastle is striking, too, as the wife who seems as trained as her clematis but turns into a steamier plant, pressing the silent matchseller to inspect her garden. The first question of the evening: 'Do you know me?' dominates both plays. As does the unspoken: 'Do I know myself?' The answers are irresistibly unclear."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
