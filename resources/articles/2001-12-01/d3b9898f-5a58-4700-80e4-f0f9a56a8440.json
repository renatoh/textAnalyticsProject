The Manchester United legend and current Aston Villa number one received the award from Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport Tessa Jowell. Schmeichel, 38, who was given the honorary recognition as non-commonwealth citizens cannot be presented the normal award, was almost overcome with emotion at the ceremony attended by his father Tolek at the DCMS headquarters in central London. Schmeichel won five league championships, three FA Cups and the 1999 European Cup during his eight-year reign as the Old Trafford shot-stopper. He said: \"I'm very, very proud. When I first got to know about this, I thought someone was playing a joke on me. But I went everywhere on the Internet to look into what this means. It's very, very special and hard to grasp. \"I'm from a foreign country and came here to play for my dream team - and what I've won before has been as part of a team, sharing the honours between us. \"This award is from the highest place in the country as recognition of my personal contribution through football. I never thought about my contribution so this is just unbelievable.\" Schmeichel senior Tolek, a well-known pianist in his own country, revealed he always wanted his son to be a musician rather than a footballer. \"I'm a musician and my wish was that Peter would also be a musician,\" he said. \"But he played football. \"Peter was very nervous before the ceremony, but it is a great day - especially for him but also for the whole family. I'm very proud. \"I've read in books about this British tradition and I'm sure it's a great honour for Peter. This has been a great day.\" MP Jowell spoke at length about the contribution Schmeichel has made to the English game, culminating when he lifted the European Cup in Barcelona's Nou Camp Stadium in 1999. She said: \"It's an unusual honour that recognition of his extraordinary talent, great contribution to football and the extent to which he has been such a powerful role model. \"He won every domestic honour with Manchester United and ended his Old Trafford career as captain on that memorable night in Barcelona. \"His return to England this season, with Aston Villa has meant fans all over the country once more have the chance to see a master at work.\" Schmeichel was at last night's BBC Sports Personality of the Year ceremony at Television Centre, where his former manager Sir Alex Ferguson collected the Lifetime Achievement Award. Ferguson said: \"Peter is a superb professional and was a fantastic loyal servant to Manchester United. \"Everyone at Old Trafford wishes him all the best and congratulate him on receiving his MBE.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
