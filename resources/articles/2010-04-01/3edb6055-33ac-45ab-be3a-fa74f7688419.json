This is partly due to a slow website, and also because most of the team names are non\u2011geographical. For several years, however, Tomsk were the team to beat. The Siberians, though, were out of contention at halfway in this week's 2010 contest in Sochi, where Moscow and St Petersburg squads vied for the lead. Both front-runners fielded six-player 2700-rated teams, a level which would outclass the best sextet from the UK. The Russian nucleus was boosted by grandmasters from the old USSR, China, and even the odd Westerner. Thus Scotland's Keti Arakhamia-Grant, a former Georgian, played on one of the women's teams. Two young GMs have advanced in Sochi. Sergey Karjakin, 20, began with 4/5 and strengthened his claim as a potential rival to his world No1 contemporary, Magnus Carlsen. Italy's Fabiano Caruana, the top under-18 in the world, here wins by a polished counter-attack. White's g4-g5 with long castling is a sharp way to meet the 3...c6 Slav Defence, but Caruana was ready. His Bb4xc3 and Ne8-d6 regroup launched his Q-side forward while White's attack was stalled. White shed a pawn and his final blunder 30 Re1? allowed a queen sacrifice for mate.

Qc1+! 0-1 Sergey Karjakin, Russia's contemporary rival to world No1 Magnus Carlsen, has been in fine form in Sochi. Here his flowing open play exploits Black's excessive queen moves.
