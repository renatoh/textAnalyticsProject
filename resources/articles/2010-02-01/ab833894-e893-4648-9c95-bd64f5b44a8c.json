A Glimmer in the Age of Darkness has since been followed by two further astronomically inspired works Connesson has written for Den\u00e8ve and the RSNO, all of which they have recently recorded. A Glimmer in the Age of Darkness, arguably the strongest of the three pieces for the RSNO, is certainly well worth revisiting. Although the title, which refers to the advent of light in the universe some 400,000 years after the Big Bang, is esoteric, the piece itself is extremely approachable. In a slowly unfolding single span of about 20 minutes, massive harmonic blocks underpin surface motion, out of which melodies emerge and then fade away. It is not rigorously intellectual music but well crafted, imaginatively orchestrated and rather compelling. Connesson's mysterious, otherworldly tone poem made a brilliant foil for Respighi's Pines of Rome, which followed, the restraint of the former juxtaposed with the vivid colours of the latter. Den\u00e8ve was in his element here, sensitive to all the possibilities of the orchestration and shaping a performance full of character. With Berlioz's Roman Carnival Overture as the opening work, this was a concert in which colour and energy took precedence over structural depth. The exception was Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto, which was given a technically impressive although rather unyielding performance by Nikolai Lugansky. After some uneasy moments of co-ordination in the first movement, soloist and orchestra reached some kind of accommodation, although it fell some way short of being an ideal partnership."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
