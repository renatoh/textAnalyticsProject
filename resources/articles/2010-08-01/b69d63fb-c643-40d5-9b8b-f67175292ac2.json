Sometimes it's bohemian and flirty, especially when I'm in Ibiza. Other times I feel more strict, especially in the city. I often make my own clothes in India, which I sell at my shop in London. 2) It's all about balance. You shouldn't mix too many colours and too many accessories, although I do love jewellery. Everyone should have a great necklace that you can wear every day and that becomes a part of your personality. 3) These days, I try to dress like a lady as I don't want to compete with my daughter's miniskirts. I'm inspired by the Edwardian and Georgian eras, both in jewellery and clothes. I love the elegance of the time. The silhouettes are so flattering. 4) It's important to feel comfortable in your own skin. I don't admire anyone's style in particular, past or present. I am quite happy with the way I look and \u2013 in private \u2013 I'm completely comfortable naked, but these days, nudie bathing is out! 5) I love a bit of make-up \u2013 especially gold eyeshadow \u2013 but I think too much can make you look tacky and old.
