The evenness of his temper, the cadences of his speech, which inflect his secular commitments with the exaltations of religion, his coolness under every insult and insinuation that his inventive opponents could devise, surely make him a hero of our time \u2013 a time in which heroes have been largely confined to areas of entertainment and sport. Indeed, some of the most admiring comments about him suggest that he brings something of the aura of a rock-star to politics; praise comes no higher than that. If he is a restorative \u2013 even redemptive \u2013 figure, who brings hope to the socially disfranchised and softens the humiliation of centuries, voices of caution have also been heard: the expectations raised can scarcely be fulfilled. Obama is not going to do anything that impairs America's interests in the world, nor will he jeopardise the interests of privilege in the USA, the majority of whose people are the most spectacular beneficiaries of globalism. If most identify themselves as middle class, this is because in the social and economic hierarchies of the contemporary world, this is what they are. As such, they are likely to remain cautious, conservative and wary of the wanting multitudes who live beyond the favoured shores of the USA. This makes Barack Obama's win the more poignant: for, despite his reputation as a middle-class pointy-head liberal, he also bears, by proxy, the stigmata of the years of slavery, and its long aftermath of injustice. More than this, as a black man, he symbolises for many, the huddled masses against which the United States has in recent years sought to seal its borders; the poor of the earth striving, through razor wire, watchtowers and vigilante groups, to reach the source, not only of global wealth, but also of their own impoverishment. This makes of him a sometimes enigmatic and highly symbolic figure. That efforts by the Republicans to exploit some of these ambiguities should have failed is a tribute to the tenacity and passion, both of Obama and his supporters. The elation and the tears, the outpouring of joy that a black man should \"capture\" the White House, is not just a vindication of those who have for generations lived and died amid discrimination, poverty and indifference. It is also a moment of sorrow: the suffering of the dead is irremediable; and the legacy of those ancient griefs is not laid to rest by symbols, however potent. Continuing inequality among the living is also not part of \"the change we can believe in\", since no American president has a mandate to interfere with the working of free markets, even when these appear to be in a state of terminal collapse. All the rescue packages, the new financial architecture, the bail-outs are calculated to mend and repair the known and the familiar, to make its functioning more efficient. And that functioning involves widening inequality, both within the USA and the wider world. Even while the structures of finance were collapsing all around them in flimsy instruments of \"securitisation\" and papery \"derivatives\", the ideological distinction between McCain and Obama was basically a crude distinction between \"wealth-creation\" on the one hand and \"spreading the wealth around\" on the other; in other words, between laissez-faire and a modest redistributive effort to bridge the chasm between rich and poor. These are not alternatives, but slight variants: all the intensity has been expended upon scarcely detectable ideological differences. They come down to a slightly tighter regulation of economic laws, themselves so unalterable they make those of the Medes and Persians appear mutable and arbitrary. Poor prisoners of faith! Just as more than 10 per cent of black males between the ages of 30 and 34 are in a prison population of 2.3 million, so a majority of blacks in the USA are prisoners of ideologies which promote equality in everything but economic status. Whatever penal reforms might be possible, it is not within Obama's power to release anyone, black or white, from the abstract ghettos or the carceral institutions which are inseparable from the veneration of success, of which Obama himself is both embodiment and emblem. His triumph itself confirms myths which reinforce historic continuities of inequality and injustice. This is why his election is a wounded accomplishment, since it presages inevitable disillusionment among those who stood in line for hours for the privilege of casting their vote, and whose intoxicated fervour has nourished his victory. The outcome of the election, in some ways, reinforces everything it was supposed to deny. If the American dream lives on, oneiromancy is still required to interpret it. Will it be Obama's fate to bear the odium for deepening recession; to take responsibility for repossessions and unemployment, falling purchasing power and deepening poverty? If the skies of New York are not raining bankers, as they reportedly were after the 1929 crash, this is because the rich have this time prudently armed themselves against the debacle they must have known was coming. It is always the poor who bear the cost of expensive repairs to the social and economic fabric. It is well that the supporters of Obama savour this moment of victory; for it is only a blink of the eye in time. It is as necessary now for the United States to have a president representing the young, the unprivileged and the minorities as it is to sustain the mythology of equal opportunity for all; for it suggests that everyone \u2013 from the barely literate single mother scarcely out of school, the young man destroyed by drugs, the abused child and the victim of the drive-by shooting are all in a position to emulate Barack Obama. The relentless taunt of success against failure will be the more potent for his win. Barack Obama's triumph, which few, even among his opponents, will grudge him, is also tinged with anticipatory foreboding. As well as a moment of jubilation, it is also one of apprehension. He is like the hero of a fairy-tale set some impossible task \u2013 to spin straw into gold before daybreak, for he must raise up the downtrodden and afflicted, while at the same time conserve the supremacy of wealth. This will require something more than the aplomb and capacity for inspiration he has shown throughout the long, wearying campaign. His job is to make capitalism, that dynamic, creative and bitter dispute between wealth and poverty, deliver justice and equity, qualities it has never yet yielded."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
