The alleged offence took place in Montague Street, London WC1. I'm not sure exactly when, I'm afraid, but I became aware of it at around 8.45pm on the night of 19 November. Two gentlemen in their 50s, both tall, and currently bearded, were witnessed riding Trikke electric tricycles on a public highway. That's \"Trikke as in crikey\", says one of them, the one with the funny nose. Now I realise UK law is a greyish area when it comes to electric scooters, trikes and the likey, but I'm pretty sure these ones are not actually street legal; ergo an offence has been committed. If I'm wrong (it has been known, I'm afraid), then I apologise. But couldn't you get them on something else? Look, they're riding their Trikkes in the park, where it clearly says No Cycling. Surely that means no Trikke triking too? Do them for antisocial behaviour at least \u2013 serve up a couple of asbos. Just a night or two in the cells, and a hefty fine, that's all I ask. And yes, I could totally pick them out in an identity parade, even with the beards. I know their names too, if it helps: one is called Jonathan Ross, the other Stephen Fry: Gadget Man (Channel 4). He's a national treasure? Pah! National disgrace, more like. And seriously, if you are going to declare something \"a perfect commuter vehicle\", as Stephen does, you need to tell us if you're actually allowed to commute on it. Likewise with the Yike Bike. (\"So called because you keep saying 'Yikes',\" says Stephen, as he's a man of words and wit.) It's the Gadget Show, basically, with extra alliterative wit and words and (possibly even wisdom?), because Stephen's doing it. He loves gadgets. They make the world a much, much better \u2013 and dare he say it, a happier \u2013 place. Who needs Prozac, when you can get an air-conditioned jacket? Each programme has a theme: commuting in this one \u2013 legally, illegally, who cares. Ah, what about helmets? If a Trikke is legal, then surely it's like a moped, and you'd have to wear a helmet? Stephen and Jonathan, who probably don't want to spoil their hair, aren't. Can we get them on that one, officer? They aren't even wearing those airbag helmets, which are worn round the neck like a snood, but which, if you crash, will suddenly inflate and unfurl a sort of blow-up baseball glove over your head in a tenth of a second. Brilliant \u2013 it's like something you'd see expect to see on The Blue Planet, a creature that lives under a rock, that needs to be slowed down considerably to be properly appreciated. You can almost hear David Attenborough gasping with wonder. From the trailers it seems that Stephen will be bringing a celebrity chum on each week. Jonathan Ross is good value; he destroys an indestructible umbrella, and points out, quite rightly, that a Renault Twizy electric car doesn't get you anywhere any faster, it still gets just as stuck in traffic. Incidentally, I see from the number plate it's the very same Twizy I tested for My Famous Motoring Column; perhaps I warmed Stephen's and Jonathan's seats for them, as a fag might do to a cold toilet seat at a very posh school. It seems that in future episodes we have Jeremy Clarkson and Alan Sugar to look forward to; no extra words or wit (or wisdom) in those ones, then. There is a Top Gear element to this, too. A team of boffins who can actually do stuff take a London taxi into their workshop and turn it into an amphibious London taxi. Stephen, bang on cue with the awittylliteration, and possibly the teeniest splash of innuendo, says he'll get mildy moist if it goes wrong. It does go wrong, but Stephen stays dry, though he does get overtaken by a duck. Hang on, I'm not totally convinced an amphibious taxi really is a gadget. Isn't it too big? Oh well, it's keeping Stephen amused. Happy too, of course, and I think that's what this is really about. In I Want To Change My Body (BBC3) a bunch of young people, unhappy about the way they look, talk with remarkable frankness about wanting to be smaller in places, bigger in other places, more curvy here, less curvy here, hairier etc. Then they do something about it, sometimes involving very expensive cosmetic surgery. Yeah, and to be honest, I'd say the after is better than the before in most cases. Well done kids, good job. And a nice positive message for other young people watching: don't stay ugly, fix yourself up, get happy. Who needs an air-conditioned jacket, when you can have a nose job?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
