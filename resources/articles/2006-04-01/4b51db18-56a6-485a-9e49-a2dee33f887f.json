Along with the code to fix various security holes in Internet Explorer, Microsoft included a patch to handle what is commonly known as the Eolas patent problem. This patch changes the way web browsers interact with ActiveX controls, and could affect things such as Macromedia Flash, Apple QuickTime, Adobe Reader and various applications that run in a browser. According to TechWeb News, a spokesman said: \"While Microsoft tries to minimise the amount of non-security updates that go out with the regularly scheduled security updates, occasionally changes are permanently made to the Windows source code and therefore are picked up in the subsequent security update that installs the affected files. This particular change falls in that category.\" Microsoft released the code in advance, to give developers some chance to fix any problems and thus minimise the impact on the web. So far, the main problem seems to have been with Siebel 7 customer relationship management (CRM) software, now owned by Oracle. Minor problems have also been reported with early versions of Google's Toolbar and some versions of Sun's Java. People who are adversely affected can use Microsoft's \"compatibility patch\" to undo the change for 60 days. The code change results from Microsoft losing $521m in a lawsuit brought by Eolas Technologies and the University of California. Ludicrous as it sounds, Eolas was given a patent \"for the embedding of small interactive programs, such as 'plug-ins', 'applets', 'scriptlets' or ActiveX Controls, into world wide web documents\". Even more ludicrously, the patent was upheld even after the web's inventor, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, and others wrote to the US Patent Office asking for it to be declared invalid. On the other hand, making it harder to run applets in a browser may not always be a bad thing. A lot of them are rubbish, and some of us are already doing what we can to block them. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
