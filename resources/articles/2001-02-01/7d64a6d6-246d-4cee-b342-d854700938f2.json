The last five times this fixture had been staged it had ended in a score-draw so, naturally, it would have been the first match a well-researched punter would have put a cross next to on his coupon. But with Everton having shown better form lately and Leicester in a malaise since Christmas, the sequence was broken as the Toffees recorded their first victory here since November. Manager Walter Smith had claimed his side had deserved more than they had got in recent matches and that he felt they had turned the corner. They desperately had to hope so if they were to stay ahead of their rivals at the bottom of the table. The root of Everton's problems can be seen clearly in the fact that they have been forced to use 30 players this season, more than any other Premiership club, and that of their 29 matches they have been able to pair Kevin Campbell and Duncan Ferguson together just once. Ferguson, having played - and scored - in the midweek match against Leeds, was ruled out with a shoulder injury. At least Everton were able to recall Francis Jeffers for his first match since September and he took just eight minutes to mark his return, though luck was on his side - which is something Everton have not been able to claim too often lately. Thomas Gravesen showed impressive strength and vision to pick out Jeffers, who was first able to take advantage of Matt Elliott's slip and then guide the ball into an empty net - after Simon Royce had blocked his initial attempt only to see the ball bounce off the young striker's shin. Royce was more fortunate in the 26th minute when he pushed over Steve Watson's header after Richard Gough had headed Gravesen's corner across the goal to him. Thankfully for Everton Campbell has not been too affected by the injury curse lately and it was he who doubled his side's advantage two minutes before the break. David Weir split the Leicester defence with a ball through the middle which, as his trademark, Campbell ran on to and rolled past the keeper for his eighth goal of the season. A triple substitution at half-time designed to wake up the listless Foxes had some effect, though it took until the 78th minute for them to reap the benefit. One of the trio, Roberto Mancini, set up Gary Rowett for a low shot which Paul Gerrard could push only into the path of Dean Sturridge to score his first goal for Leicester. Sadly for anyone sweating on a fortune, it was too little too late."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
