But the regulator is highly critical of the company's former chairman, James Murdoch, over his handling of the phone-hacking scandal. The judgment comes as News Corp is reportedly considering handing oversight of Fox Networks to James Murdoch. According to The Financial Times, Murdoch could soon be in charge of the media firm's flagship Fox network, one of its most lucrative assets, and cable channels such as FX and National Geographic. Fox Networks does not include News Corp's Fox News Channel. Ofcom criticised Murdoch, the News Corporation deputy chief operating officer and former Sky and News International chairman, for his \"lack of action\" over the News of the World phone-hacking affair. The regulator found that Murdoch's conduct in relation to News Group Newspapers \"repeatedly fell short of the conduct to be expected of as a chief executive and chairman\" and that his lack of action in relation to phone hacking was \"difficult to comprehend and ill-judged\". NGN was the News International subsidiary that published the News of the World, which was closed in July 2011 after the most damaging phone-hacking revelations emerged. Ofcom, which launched its \"fit and proper\" review of BSkyB's broadcast licences on 6 July 2011, the day before News International announced it was closing the News of the World, concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that the pay-TV company was involved in phone hacking. The ruling found: \"There is no evidence that Sky was directly or indirectly involved in any of the wrongdoing either admitted or alleged to have taken place at [the News of the World] or the Sun. \"In the circumstances, and notwithstanding our views in relation to James Murdoch's conduct, we do not consider, having taken into account all the relevant factors, that on the evidence available to date Sky is no longer fit and proper to hold broadcast licences. \"Whilst we consider that James Murdoch's conduct in various instances fell short of the standard to be expected of the chief executive officer and chairman, we do not find that James Murdoch's retention as a non-executive director of Sky means that Sky is not fit and proper to hold broadcast licences. \"We recognise that whether it is appropriate for James Murdoch to be a director in light of the events is a matter for the board and shareholders of Sky.\" Sky welcomed the long-awaited ruling as its share price rose slightly in early trading on Thursday, up 5p \u2013 nearly 1% \u2013 to 733p at 9am. News Corp said it was pleased with Ofcom's ruling regarding Sky, but disagreed with the regulator's conclusions about Murdoch, saying they were \"not at all substantiated by evidence\". BSkyB said in a statement: \"Ofcom is right to conclude that Sky is a fit and proper broadcaster. As a company, we are committed to high standards of governance and we take our regulatory obligations extremely seriously. As Ofcom acknowledges, our track record of compliance in broadcasting is good.\" \"We are proud of our contribution as a broadcaster, the investments we make to increase choice for UK audiences and the wider benefits we create for the economy.\" News Corp said: \"We are pleased that Ofcom recognises BSkyB as a fit and proper holder of a broadcast licence and remain proud of both News Corporation's and James Murdoch's distinguished record in facilitating the transformation of Sky into Britain's leading pay television and home communications provider. \"We disagree, however, with certain of the report's statements about James Murdoch's prior actions as an executive and director, which are not at all substantiated by evidence. As Ofcom itself acknowledged, James deserves credit for his role as chief executive, then chairman and now non-executive director, in leading Sky to an outstanding record as a broadcaster, including its excellent compliance record.\" The Ofcom review was aimed at establishing whether the pay-TV broadcaster remained eligible to broadcast in the UK, given that News International owner News Corp is its largest shareholder, with a 39.1% stake. At the point Ofcom launched its review, on 6 July 2011, News Corp was still bidding to take full control of Sky. It abandoned the bid the following week in the face of mounting public and political outrage over News of the World phone hacking. After reviewing evidence subsequently submitted to the Commons culture, media and sport select committee and the Leveson inquiry, Ofcom concluded that Murdoch had no knowledge of an alleged News International cover-up of what has been branded the \"industrial scale\" of phone hacking at the News of the World. \"The evidence available to date does not provide a reasonable basis to find that James Murdoch knew of widespread wrongdoing or criminality at [the News of the World] or that, by allowing litigation to be settled and by allowing NGN and News International executives to make the representations they did, he was complicit in a cover-up,\" the regulator said. However, Ofcom was critical of Murdoch's reaction to the payout to Professional Footballers Association chief executive Gordon Taylor in 2008. The regulator said it was clear at that point in 2008 that Murdoch was aware of the existence of new evidence that News of the World phone hacking may have gone beyond one rogue reporter \u2013 as News International was claiming at the time \u2013 in light of internal documents in relation to the Taylor settlement. But he did not follow up by asking to see the opinion of the senior counsel hired by the company or finding out for himself what the evidence on which the settlement was based was. \"James Murdoch's exercise of responsibility was less than we would expect to see exhibited by a competent chief executive officer,\" the regulator concluded of this episode. Ofcom also criticised Murdoch for not taking seriously a Guardian article in July 2009 headlined \"Murdoch papers paid \u00a31m to gag phone hacking victims\", which first revealed the Taylor settlement and that the practice went beyond a single rogue reporter at the News of the World. The regulator noted from Murdoch's own evidence to the culture select committee that he entrusted the handling of the response to the Guardian article to News International subordinates, rather than launch an investigation into whether phone hacking involved the three individuals referred to in internal communications. This information subsequently emerged during a culture select committee inquiry. \"We consider that James Murdoch's failure to apprise himself of this information, given the information which he accepts he knew, fell short of the exercise of responsibility to be expected of the chief executive officer and the chairman,\" Ofcom said. Murdoch was also criticised for failing to respond meaningfully to a highly critical report by the culture select committee on phone hacking in 2010. \"We consider this lack of action by the chairman of News International in response to a widely publicised highly critical select committee report to be both difficult to comprehend and ill-judged,\" Ofcom said. It also expresses bafflement over Murdoch's inaction when the phone-hacking scandal began to escalate with the publication of fresh evidence in the New York Times in September 2010 and with the launch of legal action by Sienna Miller, which became public in December 2010. Ofcom noted that Murdoch gave evidence to the Leveson inquiry earlier this year that he immediately moved to get his house in order with three specific courses of action: an internal investigation; action against any employees involved in wrongdoing; and seeking fresh legal advice to get to the bottom of what was really going on. \"Having reviewed the relevant evidence relating to this period as a whole, we note that only one of these steps was taken in 2010,\" Ofcom concluded. \"In light of the events which occurred in 2009 and 2010, in particular the publication of the [culture select committee] report, the growing civil litigation and the New York Times article, we find it difficult to comprehend James Murdoch's lack of action, given his responsibility as chairman.\" His father Rupert Murdoch, News Corp's chairman and chief executive, escapes censure by Ofcom. The regulator said it did not find the evidence provided a basis to conclude Rupert Murdoch had acted in a way that was inappropriate in relation to phone hacking, concealment or corruption by employees. Ofcom also found that BSkyB was not involved. \"To date there is no evidence that Sky was directly or indirectly involved in any of the wrongdoing either admitted or alleged to have taken place at the News of the World.\" News Corp said: \"We are also pleased that Ofcom determined that the evidence related to phone hacking, concealment and corruption does not provide any basis to conclude that News Corporation and Rupert Murdoch acted in a way that was inappropriate, and that there is similarly no evidence that James Murdoch deliberately engaged in any wrongdoing.\" If the regulator had decided that either James Murdoch \u2013 who stood down as chairman of News International in March 2012 and as chairman of BSkyB in April, but remains on the board of the broadcaster as a non-executive director \u2013 or the company itself were not fit and proper owners, the regulator could have revoked its licences. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
