Jarratt originally sued the Telegraph in the NSW supreme court over a front-page story detailing allegations by a former housemate, but dropped the lawsuit in August after he was found not guilty of rape. However, on 22 November he filed a fresh lawsuit in the federal court \u2013 a jurisdiction that has several advantages to plaintiffs including speed and the lack of a jury. In a statement of claim filed with the court, Jarratt says a separate article the Telegraph published on 7 July reporting the reaction of his accuser to the not guilty verdict conveyed imputations including that he \u201cis a rapist\u201d and \u201cgot away with rape\u201d. He claims the article also defamed him by saying he \u201cruined a woman\u2019s life by sexually assaulting her\u201d so that she was \u201cunable to marry and have children\u201d and \u201cgot away with ruining a woman\u2019s life by sexually assaulting her\u201d. Jarratt has applied for aggravated damages because of the \u201cover-sensationalised\u201d tone of the article and because the Telegraph knew he had been acquitted three days earlier. His lawyer, Bill Kalantzis, declined to comment when asked why Jarratt had commenced a second defamation suit in the federal court. However, barrister Bruce McClintock SC, who represented Jarratt in the first defamation action, said it was \u201cbecause he was defamed a second time\u201d. McClintock said Jarratt had no need to avoid a jury by choosing the federal court, pointing out he was found not guilty by a jury at his criminal trial. \u201cThe real reason is speed,\u201d he said. The aggravated damages claim was not absurd, he said. \u201cThis looks to me like News Corp doubling down. News asserted Jarratt was guilty when they knew he had been acquitted.\u201d Speaking generally, McClintock said defamation lawsuits were not a quick and easy money-maker. \u201cNo plaintiff commences proceedings as a shakedown for quick cash and I\u2019ll tell you why: it never happens. Media organisations fight and they fight very hard.\u201d The Telegraph\u2019s owner, News Corp, has been contacted for comment. Jarratt\u2019s lawsuit comes as state and federal attorneys general consider an overhaul of defamation laws that media companies and journalists say have become unworkable and created a chilling effect due to a series of sky-high payouts to plaintiffs. The role and increased popularity of the federal court for these cases has also come under scrutiny, with experts saying the ability for plaintiffs to choose whether or not to run their case in front of a jury is \u201ccontrary to the legislative intent\u201d of Australia\u2019s defamation laws. Media organisations are also believed to be unhappy with new guidelines for defamation cases issued by the court\u2019s chief justice, James Allsop, that contain several plaintiff-friendly features. These include a tight timeline to file defences and a clause that discourages judges from carving off the question of whether imputations claimed by the plaintiff are actually contained in the publication in question. Instead, all such issues are to be decided at trial. If followed, this would prevent media organisations knocking out allegations at an early stage in the process and instead force them to make a full defence of imputations they claim do not arise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
