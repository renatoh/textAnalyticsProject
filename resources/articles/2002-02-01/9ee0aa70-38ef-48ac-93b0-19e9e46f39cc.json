Or maybe Dick Rockface? On the eve of Ireland's visit to Twickenham today, it is easy to imagine Richard Hill's agent sitting in a leather-bound swivel chair, fingers drumming on the desk, staring yet again at his client's picture. Resorting to deed poll is the last refuge of the desperate, but how else to make the general public more appreciative of England's No6? It is not entirely Hill's fault. He did not, after all, sign the current deal depriving terrestrial viewers of live coverage of England's home matches. But his profile is summed up by the story of the French reporter who once spent an entire interview under the mistaken impression he was talking to Austin Healey rather than \"Hilly\". It was only after 10 minutes of questions about Hill's ability as a winger - \"How are you going to deal with our Christophe Dominici?\" - that the euro finally dropped. Few players in English rugby history, one suspects, have earned such truck-loads of respect from their peers and yet remained so relatively invisible. After five years as a Test regular, 45 England caps and two high-achieving Lions tours, the closest the 28-year-old comes to mass adoration is being approached by curious grannies in public swimming pools, wondering where they can get one of the flotation belts he uses for post-match recovery sessions. This afternoon, however, Hill's cloak of anonymity may finally begin to slip, out of necessity. For, if England are to beat the Irish, nullifying the visitors' outstanding back row will be crucial. Normally this would be a safe bet but Lawrence Dallaglio is still injured and even the remarkable Neil Back will have his hands full. Hill may not kick the goals, captain the team, go in for hair transplants or frequent showbiz parties but, with all due respect to his captain Martin Johnson and Jonny Wilkinson, he is the man England would dread losing most an hour before kick-off. For Hill, who has represented England on merit in all three back-row positions, is the kind of player people notice most when he is not there, akin to the missing staple in a glossy magazine. Italy's coach Brad Johnstone rates Healey \"the best player in Europe\" and would give a garage full of Ferraris to have him in his backline but England's manager Clive Woodward insists there is not a coach in the world who would omit Hill from his side. It is some accolade and Hill's team-mates will seize on it gleefully as further evidence that a reluctant new media star is on the slipway. Hill, typically, is less convinced. \"If anything there's more banter now about the fact I get recognition but it still gets portrayed as though I don't.\" Nor is he the type to rush out and dye his hair blond to wrest attention from the swish types in the backline, let alone believe his own press. \"Sometimes you wonder if the newspaper columnists shouldn't get together and work out whether you've had a good game or not.\" Others, though, need no reminding of Hill's prowess. The Lions coach Graham Henry has already pinpointed Hill's injury during the second Test as the turning point of the series against the Wallabies. Henry's assistant on last summer's tour, Andy Robinson, says he regularly tried to persuade the Saracens stalwart to sign for Bath during his time at the Rec. That was not just when he was coach but while he was still playing. Coming from arguably the most competitive flanker of the lot, that really is a compliment. \"What impresses me most about Richard, and it's the same with Neil Back, is his ability to read the game,\" says the now England coach. \"It allows him to get into positions which other players can't. He never gets bigger than the team and you can guarantee when he goes out there he's going to deliver.\" The story also goes that last season another of the world's best-known back-row forwards, Francois Pienaar, slipped a blank sheet of paper across the desk and invited Hill to name his own price to stay at Saracens. Pienaar, who announced his resignation as coach and chief executive yesterday, denies the tale but got his man for four more years. Had he failed, perhaps only Dallaglio and Wilkinson could have generated comparable interest among potential alternative employers. For the definitive view on Hill, though, it is best to talk to those who stand alongside him on the front line, all of whom marvel at his ability to sparkle in places where the sun never strays. Back, the third member of the most capped collective Test back-row unit in history, is as awestruck as anyone. \"Richard performs well in every game he plays and, because people have got so used to that, it makes it difficult for him to be truly outstanding. A lot of people see back-rowers doing flash things and think 'this player's fantastic' but those who truly know about rugby appreciate what he does. He does the things which allow other players to shine.\" Not that the quiet man of English rugby is entirely perfect. Pienaar sometimes wishes Hill would show \"a bit more aggression\" and his friends reckon he could just as easily moan for England. At Saracens, for whom he has just chalked up 200 appearances, they have made fun of his Victor Meldrew tendencies for years. \"When he's moaning he's the true Richard and you know everything's fine,\" smiles Kyran Bracken. Back recalls the day last season when both England flankers needed stitches simultaneously during the South Africa game and Hill complained because he was relegated to a treatment room without a telly in it. From mini-rugby as a five-year-old in Salisbury upwards, though, no one has ever questioned Hill's loyalty, honesty or modesty, the three qualities which best define him. Like a true son of Wessex, he still stiffens whenever he sees a tape recorder and plumps for unfashionable patriotism as his ultimate motivation. \"I want to be there, so you'll do anything to stay there,\" he says, politely challenging the younger rivals chasing his shirt to match him if they can. \"If it's not competitive you get complacent so it's great if people are chomping at the bit, really enthusiastic and wanting your place - as long as wanting it is as far as it goes.\" If that sounds like a man with a relentless work ethic and a perfectionist's frown, that is Hill all over. \"I'd like to be playing a bit better. I don't think I've had as good a season as I might have had over the last couple of years. What I did in the summer is not going to be enough to sustain me over the next year or so. You've got to be able to recognise you're not God's gift.\" To drop Hill, even to the bench, though, is as unthinkable as Salisbury cathedral minus its towering spire. He is England's rock-solid heart and, when he talks about Ireland, it is the equally unfussy qualities of their No8 Anthony Foley which worry him most. \"He's prepared to go the extra hard yard in order for the team to reach glory. It's going to be an immense challenge for the forwards, full stop. If we play like we did in Scotland this Irish team will beat us.\" Should Hill perform to his normal standards, on the other hand, England will take some getting past and their most reliable cog will have done even more to justify the honorary degree he is due to receive from Brunel University this summer for his services to rugby. As a former student he could not be more chuffed if he had been invited to tea at Buckingham Palace. If England finally win a grand slam this jubilee year, that might just happen too. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
