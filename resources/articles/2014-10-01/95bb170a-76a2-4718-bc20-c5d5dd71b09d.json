Hart took 63% of the vote on the website of the England sponsor Vauxhall as fans recognised his flawless performance against the team that is ranked as the worst in the world by Fifa. Hart, of course, had nothing to do and the jape chimed with some of the themes of the evening \u2013 principally, San Marino\u2019s slapstick performance and the desire of many supporters to see the funny side. The England midfielder Jack Wilshere was named as the official man of the match by the TV pundits and he played his part, particularly in the second half, in over-running the visitors. The substitutes Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Adam Lallana were also prominent, together with Rooney and his strike partner Danny Welbeck. Rooney scored the second goal, from the penalty spot, as he moved onto 42 international goals, seven short of Sir Bobby Charlton\u2019s all-time mark for the country. But Rooney also missed two one-on-one chances in the second-half \u2013 the first, when his chip did not have enough on it; the second, when he failed to dribble around the goalkeeper Aldo Simoncini. Rooney could not beat Simoncini on other occasions. \u201cThe record won\u2019t play on Wayne\u2019s mind,\u201d Hodgson, the England manager, said. \u201cHow old is he? [29 later in the month.] We\u2019d like to think, with the way he is and the footballer he is, he\u2019s got a good few years in him yet. There are plenty of games left. I don\u2019t think we should put any pressure on him to reach targets early. \u201cHe got in a lot of times tonight. His runs were very good. He\u2019s a bit disappointed with the chip. He thought that was on. I\u2019m more than happy with him. It was another good captain\u2019s performance. He was solid throughout.\u201d Hodgson substituted the Liverpool players Jordan Henderson and Raheem Sterling at half-time but he denied that had anything to do with the fall-out from the Daniel Sturridge controversy. Liverpool have been angry at how Sturridge was injured on England duty in September and the manager, Brendan Rodgers, had made it clear that the striker would not be available for San Marino or Sunday\u2019s qualifier in Estonia. \u201cTo be fair to Brendan, when I spoke to him about Daniel, we knew he wouldn\u2019t be ready,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about the other two [Henderson and Sterling]. It was our decision to bring them off. \u201cWith the wealth of talent we have in attacking areas, it was nice to take people like Sterling, Henderson and Welbeck off. They might play an important role for us against Estonia.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
