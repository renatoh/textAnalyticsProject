The spat, which puts at risk \u00a360m of business a year between the two companies, erupted after Heineken refused to supply its lager and Murphy\u2019s stout to Wetherspoon\u2019s new pub in D\u00fan Laoghaire, County Dublin and demanded a personal guarantee from Wetherspoon\u2019s chief executive, John Hutson, in order to supply any other of its products to the pub. The guarantee would make him liable for any debt the pub group had with the brewer. Wetherspoon is due to open its D\u00fan Laoghaire pub next week, its second venue in Ireland, as part of an assault on the Irish market where it hopes to open 30 pubs. The latest spat follows a row with Guinness owner Diageo over pricing, which resulted in Wetherspoon\u2019s first pub in Ireland \u2013 The Three Tun Tavern in the Dublin suburb of Blackrock - launching without being able to serve Ireland\u2019s most famous pint. Wetherspoon founder and chairman Tim Martin said: \u201cWe have been trading with Heineken for 35 years and they have never requested personal guarantees before. It\u2019s obstructive to do so now, especially when we made record profits of around \u00a380m last year. \u201cThe refusal to supply Heineken lager and Murphy\u2019s just before the opening of our new pub in D\u00fan Laoghaire, which represents an investment by us of nearly \u20ac4m, is unacceptable and hard to understand.\u201d A spokesman for Heineken UK said it was \u201cunfortunate that commercial issues in Ireland between Heineken Ireland and JD Wetherspoon have led to the current situation. We are seeking a resolution as soon as possible. It is not our intention to comment in any further detail at this point.\u201d Drinks industry analysts said Heineken, which is considered a premium lager in Ireland, may have been attempting to hit back at Wetherspoon for charging \u20ac3 a pint for its lager when the average price in the country is about \u20ac5. They also speculated that the request for a personal guarantee provided Martin with an opportunity to make a stand in a country where brewers tend to have more power than pub companies, which are typically far smaller than in the UK. Simon Matthews, analyst at Goodbody stockbrokers in Dublin, said: \u201cWhether it is a coordinated strategy, or Heineken Ireland has acted without considering the repercussions for the rest of the group, I don\u2019t know. But clearly it has upset JD Wetherspoon\u2019s management. \u201cAsking for a personal guarantee from the chief executive of a company of this size, that is performing strongly, is very unusual. I think that the reaction from Wetherspoon is understandable seeing as it is due to open an 8,000 square foot premises next week and these requests from Heineken appear to have come out of the blue.\u201d Apart from its lager and Murphy\u2019s, Heineken also owns Beamish stout. Wetherspoon plans to serve Bath Ales Dark Side Stout and Marston\u2019s Revisionist Craft Stout instead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
