DNA tests indicated that the 21-year-old student was raped by both men. The suspects were arrested at a pier on the Thai resort island of Koh Samui, where Ms Horton had been staying, early this morning. She was raped and murdered on New Year's Day. The Reading University student was attacked as she spoke to her mother on her mobile phone while walking alone on the beach in the evening. Her body, still in an evening dress, was discovered two miles away by a jetskier in the Gulf of Thailand on the morning of January 2. Police said the two fishermen were arrested after more than a dozen suspects, both Thai and foreign, had been questioned. The fishermen were taken to Bangkok for the DNA testing. After the tests, the deputy chief of national police, General Phrewphan Damaphong, told reporters the results indicated that the DNA of both men matched evidence found on Ms Horton's body. Police said one of the suspects, Bualoi Posit, 23, told officers he had assaulted and raped Ms Horton. The other, 24-year-old Wichai Somkhaoyai, confessed to being an accomplice to her murder but denied rape. The men could face the death penalty if convicted of murder. Police Major Asawin Khawanmuang said the fishermen told police they had seen Ms Horton as she walked on the beach and approached her from behind. He said both had admitted to beating her with a wooden club and dragging her into the sea. The backpacker had received a call from her mother, Elizabeth, who told police she heard a scream before the line went dead. A British couple on holiday in Thailand found her phone on the beach. Today's arrests followed an unusual public appeal last week by the Thai prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, for Ms Horton's killers to be caught. He said the murder had damaged the country's image and could harm its tourism industry, which has already suffered a downturn following last year's tsunami and the bird flu scare. Ms Horton had been on a two-week backpacking tour to Thailand with her university friend Ruth Adams. Her father Ian and brother Christopher were reported to have flown to Heathrow airport with her body yesterday. Tonight Ms Adams spoke of the \"huge void\" in her life following the death of her best friend. \"We spent New Year's Day together, snorkelling and splashing around in the sea, sunbathing and chatting. Now all of that has gone for ever, and there is a huge void in my life,\" she said. \"My words cannot express the loss and devastation that I feel knowing I have lost my best friend in the most brutal, evil and permanent way imaginable. \"Kath and I were inseparable. We knew each other inside out and shared everything.\" A second postmortem examination, in addition to the examination performed in Thailand, was due to be carried out in the UK. The office of Cardiff's coroner said a date had not yet been set for an inquest into Ms Horton's death."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
