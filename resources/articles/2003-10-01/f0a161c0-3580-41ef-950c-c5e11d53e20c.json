But during the day the company's share price was significantly damaged. Rumours swept Newcastle yesterday that Robson had decided to walk away from the job and, though wrong, they gained such currency that Newcastle's share price was affected. Between 1pm and 3pm shares fell 5p, an 18% drop. At 3.25pm the following statement was released to the Stock Exchange: \"Newcastle United notes recent media speculation regarding Sir Bobby Robson and confirms that Sir Bobby Robson has not resigned and that any reports to the contrary are completely unfounded.\" Shares then rallied to close at 30p, 2p down on the day. That is a drop of 7.5%, roughly equivalent to \u00a33.6m. Newcastle's chairman Freddy Shepherd is one of the largest shareholders in the club so it will have had a direct impact on him. Robson is under pressure from Shepherd and the Newcastle hierarchy, but it would be remarkable for him to resign. A first Premiership win at home to Southampton on Saturday is imperative, however. Newcastle are one place above Wolves at the bottom of the Premiership."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
