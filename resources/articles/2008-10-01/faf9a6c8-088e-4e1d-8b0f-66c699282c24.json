Though born in Glasgow, he had been a supporter of Dundee United for almost 40 years when he won control of the club in 2002, after a long and bitter battle. By the time of his death, its financial position had been secured; today, United are again a force to be reckoned with in Scottish football, and the supporters' trust that Thompson encouraged is the club's second biggest shareholder, behind his family. At the Scottish league cup final earlier this year, thousands of Dundee United fans - aware that his days were numbered - donned \"One Eddie Thompson\" T-shirts. A stand at Tannadice Park was named in his honour and since news of his death was announced, vast numbers of floral tributes have been deposited at the ground. It is all a far cry from football clubs owned by sheikhs and oligarchs. Thompson made his fortune in the grocery business. Educated at Hyndland secondary school, Glasgow, and trained as an accountant, he moved to Dundee in 1964 with a wholesaleing company, Watson &amp; Philip. He became managing director in 1989, though by this time he had ambitions to develop a chain of convenience stores, often in areas where other retailers would not go. The company he developed, called Morning, Noon and Night, transformed the image of the corner shop in Scotland and created a model that was widely emulated. By the time he sold it to one of the Scottish Co-operative societies in 2004 for \u00a330m, it had more than 50 branches and employed 800 people. He was made an OBE in 2005 in recognition of his skill as a retailer. From the 1980s Thompson was involved with Dundee United as a shirt sponsor. Those were glory days for the Tannadice club and a remarkable era in Scottish football, with the \"new firm\" of Aberdeen under Alex Ferguson and United under Jim McLean vying for supremacy over Celtic and Rangers. Dundee United achieved the astonishing feat in 1984 of reaching the European Cup semi-final, only to be beaten by Roma in a game where the referee was later shown to have been bribed. As the club descended into mediocrity and financial difficulty during the 1990s, the clamour for ownership to be opened to a wider range of shareholders grew. Thompson made repeated efforts to invest and finally, after a four-year battle, bought McLean's shareholding in 2002 for \u00a31m and put in another \u00a34m. For most of his remaining years, Thompson was fighting cancer. Yet he remained an enthusiastic and committed figure in Scottish football. His amiable manner did not stop him being ruthless, particularly in the removal of managers, four of whom came and went during his tenure. The fifth to cross the Tannadice threshold, the former Hearts player Craig Levein, developed a deeply felt personal, as well as professional, relationship with Thompson. Craig said: \"He was as good a football club chairman as any manager could wish for, but I will remember him primarily as a decent man\" - a sentiment echoed throughout the football firmament. Thompson is survived by his wife, Cath, his son, Stephen, and his daughter, Justine, who become the club's major shareholders. \u2022 Edward 'Eddie' Thompson, businessman and football club chairman, born July 16 1940; died October 15 2008"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
