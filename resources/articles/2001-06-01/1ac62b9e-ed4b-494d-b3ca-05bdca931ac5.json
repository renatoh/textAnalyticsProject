In the early hours of Friday, in his series of victory speeches, he promised, without any weasel words, that Britain would be a better place in five years' time: he re-affirmed an aggressive commitment to invest heavily in public services and to attack poverty. He even, as an aside, pledged to build a criminal justice system in which rehabilitation ranks as importantly as punishment - the preoccupation of woolly liberals. Indeed New Labour has now made a number of formal pledges that together represent a series of formidable benchmarks besides which it will be judged at the next general election. It is committed to halving child poverty by 2010 as part of its target to eliminate it within a generation; to educate half the 18- to 30-year-olds in some form of tertiary education by 2010; to close the productivity gap with our main competitors and to sustain a 'higher percentage of people in work than ever before as we seek full employment in every region'. And there are pledges with less clear targets, but arguably even more important; to have moved visibly towards a first-class NHS, an integrated transport system, and the tackling of pensioner poverty. These are no idle commitments. Blair's brush with the voters in the television and radio studios and on the streets, the disproportionate fall in Labour's vote in its heartlands, the consolidation of the Lib Dem vote and the collapse of the turnout all point in the same direction. After New Labour's first term there is cynicism about the political process. It is not just a political imperative for Blair that in his second term he is seen to lead the country and deliver the improvements he has promised, free from spin. It is a moral imperative. He believes in politics and is dismayed that he can engage so few of his fellow citizens in the same belief. So the low-key partying on Friday morning and the lack of triumphalism that are meant to convey the message that New Labour is back at work were not just empty symbolism. They represent what the Prime Minister intends. Equally he believes that the 'forces of conservatism' have been vanquished culturally as much as politically; he noted the subdued stance of the Daily Mail in the run-up to the election - the tepid issue on election day he will have regarded as one of his most important victories. This opens up the opportunity that is closest to his heart; to make Britain the leader of the European integration process, shaping the EU around British rather than French and German interests and to win acceptance from the majority of British public opinion that this is the right thing to do. He wants to bury Euroscepticism. And to join the euro by winning the referendum in June next year is central to this process. Improving public services, sustaining economic growth and joining the single currency are thus the three most important aims of his second term. The open question is whether the Prime Minister has the organisational instruments, Civil Service management and sufficient cash even to get near these targets. The second comprehensive spending review promises growth in public spending of 3.8 per cent a year to 2002/2003, with more than 5 per cent a year growth in education and health spending. One of the more important commitments that the media wrung out of him during the campaign was when he told Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight that he would use the third comprehensive spending review, ending in 2005/2006, to lift NHS spending to hit the European average, and that education spending would match it. Health and education will have the biggest sustained increase in spending since 1945. Yet this will only make a difference if the money is actually spent and public-sector efficiency rises - and even then the impact will be only moderate compared with the scale of public-sector dereliction. The difficulty in the first term was that the demoralised Civil Service was unable to bring forward investment projects despite the fact that cash was earmarked; public-sector investment has been underspent for the past two years by \u00a35 billion. Blair and Brown have to make sure the civil servants spend the cash. The response is to establish a public service delivery arm in No10 and to give John Prescott, as Deputy Prime Minister, the authority to see that the manifesto commitments are met. Many in Whitehall see this as scarcely adequate, at least in relation to public investment. What has paralysed the whole effort is the cumbersome process of trying to launch private finance initiatives and public-private partnerships, numbingly complex and which, if they are to offer genuine value for money, demand endless negotiation and renegotiation. If the Prime Minister wants investment to go forward rapidly he must impart a sense of mobilisation, and a willingness to allow the public sector to initiate investment on its own without private support or participation. Here his preference to introduce the private sector will be directly at odds with his other preoccupation: speed. If the public-sector unions oppose him as they promise, the radicalism over involving the private sector Blair spoke about may prove to be moonshine. Indeed his most difficult early test will be rail investment, which may take him in the opposite direction - more state involvement. The City and leading financial institutions are telling the Government that the privatised Railtrack is unable to shoulder the financial burden of supporting rail modernisation. It needs to be recapitalised, and pension funds and insurance companies will only buy sufficient new shares if there are explicit public involvement and guarantees, including public ownership of any new share issue - in other words partial public ownership. Nor can the Government wait. The prevarications over Railtrack and the four-year negotiation over the PPP for the London Underground simply cannot be repeated if the transport system is not to be a major vote loser in 2005. On the economy, the productivity and employment targets are ambitious. The new Department of Education and Skills is to focus on upgrading skills; employment is being housed in the new Department of Work and Pensions; and regional development agencies are to encourage entrepreneurialism. But British productivity weakness is deep-seated; the innovation shortfall that afflicts business has its roots in corporate culture and the short-termism of the financial system, and here Labour has drawn back from any major intervention. With the economy likely to falter as it becomes more obvious that the US is in a protracted downturn, the hoped for productivity and employment growth will prove elusive. But the most difficult economic and political call is the euro. If Blair wants to hold a successful referendum next year, he must start campaigning almost immediately - by September at the latest - if he is to swing public opinion. But there is no point in launching the campaign if the Treasury economic assessment, to begin in the autumn, about whether the five economic tests to join the euro are met is likely to make ambiguous or even negative recommendations. Here the Chancellor's opinion could not be more important. Senior Treasury officials are sceptical about whether Britain could join soon, believing that the exchange rate would have to be at least 15 per cent lower than the current rate with inflationary implications. Politically, the Chancellor believes that the euro issue so divides the Conservatives that deferring the referendum to 2006 or 2007 offers Labour the near guarantee of winning the next election for the parliament in which he hopes to be Prime Minister. Tensions over exchange-rate policy broke the winning partnership between Margaret Thatcher and the then Chancellor Nigel Lawson in the Eighties. Similarly, the euro has all the capacity to break up the relationship between Brown and Blair. Even this weekend this couple at the heart of New Labour will be having some of the toughest exchanges of their relationship. Get this wrong and the Government could fragment fatally. Paradoxically, one of the areas where New Labour may make most progress is over the Old Labour concern with poverty; it has developed innovative instruments, ranging from the working family tax credit to the minimum income retirement guarantee which, if it simply lifts aggressively enough, it can meet its targets. Some working-class and pensioner incomes look set to increase substantially over the next four years. But the overriding watchword is public service delivery. A revived Tory party aiming to recapture the centre ground will use every promise and unmet target to challenge the Government at the next election. It will be on this that New Labour above all will be judged. Unless there is a decisive break with what happened in the first term, the next election could be a great deal more finely balanced than this one.
