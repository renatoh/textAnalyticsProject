Shay Given broke his thumb. And their team-mates broke Geordie hearts. All in all, it was a dreadful afternoon for Newcastle and, with their England striker out \"for months\", according to Graeme Souness, there are more bleak days in prospect for this maddeningly inconsistent team. As they slide inexorably down the table, the manager's \u00a350million investment in what ought to be a squad capable of delivering results looks like money down the drain. He would not be drawn on whether the January transfer window represents an opportunity to shore up the ramparts or whether an Arctic blast of reality will rattle through St James' Park. And the stark news is, as Martin Jol pointed out, they have lost their best player. The Toon Army had travelled in expectation of seeing Alan Shearer equal Jackie Milburn's club record of 200 goals. They left White Hart Lane informed over the public address system that \"all trains are running normally, but there won't be any to Liverpool Street for an hour\". It was farce of a piece with the afternoon's football. While Shearer failed to score his 200th goal, Teemu Tainio was on hand to log his first in English football, a calmly struck, low bullet that slid agonisingly wide of Given's dive and nestled in the right corner of the net at the Park Lane End. The visiting fans were stunned - by the score and the preceding ineptitude of Titus Bramble, who had stumbled and failed to cope with Paul Robinson's long clearance. It was one of many long thumps out of goal, indicative of the poor quality of ground play by both sides. The first half, in particular, was blighted by desperate hacks, ill-considered passes and aerial filth. The most cultured passage of play was a decent header out of the press box when yet another clearance went where it wasn't supposed to. It's hard to believe two teams fielding players of such undoubted pedigree could cram so much ugliness into one match. But they did. What is the point of having Owen and Shearer playing in front of a midfield incapable of stringing two passes together? 'To Do Is To Dare' screams the Spurs motto above the goals. To which a reasonable response might be: how dare they do this to us? For Spurs to bring their B game and win so handily is a terrible indictment of Newcastle. Souness's team can do no more than put this one behind them, as they slip 12 points behind Tottenham. Meanwhile, Jol, forever cautious, even conceded Spurs have a fair chance of a Champions League place: 'If the younger players step up, as they have been doing, we could be in the top four.' For the Dutchman, that is bordering on the boastful. He was well served by Jermaine Jenas, whom he reckoned had his best game for the club since arriving from Newcastle in August. He was kind also to Michael Carrick - rightly so - for his intelligent distribution, and proud of Edgar Davids: \"He is 32, playing his third game in five days.\" True. But he wasn't as sharp as usual. There was so much crazy traffic in midfield, the game lacked any shape, and Davids' manic bursts didn't do much to calm things. Only in the second half, when Spurs settled down, did it remotely resemble a top-flight contest. But even the second goal had an element of ugliness about it. Robbie Keane (who Jol insisted is not going to Scotland) provided a bit of magic in pulling down a long ball on the left, driving goalward and delivering a lovely lob to Mido - who banged it clumsily into the turf with his left foot, the ball bouncing over Given into the left corner. Thereafter, Tottenham were in total control, as much through the visitors' ineptitude as their own class. This absurd holiday fixture list is providing some desperate football.
