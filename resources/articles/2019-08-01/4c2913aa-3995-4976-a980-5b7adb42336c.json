Now the former shadow assistant treasurer is candid that perhaps Labor had too many ideas \u2013 even if many were good ones. \u201cEnsuring that voters go into the polling booth understanding the core philosophy of Labor is what counts,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. \u201cYou can overwhelm with detail and [that\u2019s] certainly one of the critiques that\u2019s been made of the last election. \u201cIf that\u2019s correct then I\u2019m as guilty as anyone, having produced a whole raft of policy on competition, multinational tax and the like. \u201cSo I certainly take my share of blame for our election loss. But we can\u2019t change from being a party of policy to being a party of slogans and demonising.\u201d The MP, no longer on the frontbench but still a shadow assistant minister, has for several years hung 10 principles of politics on his wall. They have caught the eye of the Museum of Australian Democracy, which wants a copy for its collection. The MoAD director, Daryl Karp, says the museum is always on the lookout for objects that tell a story and connect with the public, part of an effort to \u201crebuild trust in the processes of civic engagement \u2026 and encouraging people to be excited by democracy\u201d. She cites previous acquisitions including Julie Bishop\u2019s shoes, a tracksuit from John Howard, and a bicycle from Tony Abbott. Leigh\u2019s principles include noble sentiments that Labor communications \u201cshould try to engage with the better instincts of Australia, to tell stories, make new arguments and convey fresh facts\u201d. \u201cWhen we dumb down debates and demonise our opponents, progressives lose. When we enrich the public conversation, we win.\u201d That plea for positivity seems a bit incongruous, coming after the 2016 election which Labor almost won on the back of a negative campaign arguing the Coalition would privatise Medicare, and the 2019 election, in which Labor lost offering policies so extensive it seemed to be running as an incumbent government. \u201cThe arguments go beyond any particular election cycle,\u201d Leigh says. \u201cYou can always tell a convincing story \u2026 about why some particular tactic might work in a certain moment of history. \u201cBut from an overall strategic standpoint the progressive side of politics is looking for opportunities to use the power of government to improve the quality of people\u2019s lives. \u201cI think back to Ronald Reagan, who said \u2018government isn\u2019t the solution, government is the problem\u2019. Reagan\u2019s demonising of the role of government and politicians was deliberate; he recognised his side \u2026 benefited when people trusted government less.\u201d Burned by an extremely negative Coalition campaign amplifying claims Labor would introduce a death tax and falsely claiming that Labor would tax non-electric cars, another colleague who now finds himself on the backbench \u2013 Ed Husic \u2013 has proposed his version of the high road: an \u201carmistice\u201d on fake news. Leigh acknowledges the high road will be \u201ctough \u2013 but the alternative is to simply become Liberal-lite\u201d. He thinks Labor should be \u201cwitty and sharp\u201d in making its arguments but endorses Labor leader Anthony Albanese\u2019s direction banning MPs from calling opponents liars because it is a currency that has become \u201cdebased\u201d. Leigh wants to make politics \u201ca bit more gracious and a bit less aggressive\u201d. And also \u2013 it would appear \u2013 a bit quieter. Media coverage, the 10 principles state, is \u201ca means, not an end\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 a reminder to myself and my team that while it might be pleasing to see your name in dispatches, the main game is improving people\u2019s lives,\u201d Leigh says. \u201cThere\u2019s always the risk for anyone in politics that you worry about column inches rather than about tangible improvements. \u201cIt\u2019s often a question of whether you can achieve more quietly, internally, by collaborating with others by focusing on the outcome rather than on publicity \u2026 All of us have egos, and our challenge is to ensure our egos aren\u2019t what\u2019s driving things.\u201d Leigh\u2019s principles also aim to help keep politics human. They ask staff to \u201cact ethically, crack jokes when we can, and keep a sense of perspective\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t apologise for spending time with friends and family, exercising or reading fiction\u201d. \u201cNot only is socialising important in itself; a well-rounded life helps us do our jobs better. Strive for calmness, balance and gratitude.\u201d Karp says the 10 principles are a \u201cdynamic entry point\u201d to understanding some of the contemporary challenges of modern politics, including the 24/7 media cycle, work-life balance, and the prevailing \u201ccombative approach\u201d to politics. \u201cIt represents an individual setting out their values and then standing by them,\u201d she says. \u201cWhether it becomes a substantial historical document is unknown, but for now \u2026 it speaks to the contemporary zeitgeist of visitors and the challenges of politics.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
