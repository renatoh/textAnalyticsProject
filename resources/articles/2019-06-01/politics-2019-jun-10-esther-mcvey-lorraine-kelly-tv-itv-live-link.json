McVey, who is considered a long shot to become the next prime minister, was previously a television presenter who at one point hosted GMTV in the 1990s alongside Kelly, a mid-morning TV stalwart known for her genial demeanour. During a live link to ITV\u2019s Lorraine from Good Morning Britain, where McVey appeared as a guest on Monday, Susanna Reid said: \u201cDo you remember Esther McVey from her GMTV days?\u201d Kelly glossed over the question, shook her head and said curtly: \u201cYeah, yes I do. OK, coming up after half past eight \u2026 \u201d Piers Morgan then asked Kelly: \u201cSo you got on with Esther then, Lorraine?\u201d The presenter replied: \u201cI don\u2019t remember love, I don\u2019t remember at all, it was an awful long time ago.\u201d This year, Kelly won a landmark tax case after arguing she is a theatrical agent playing a \u201cfriendly, chatty and fun personality\u201d called Lorraine Kelly, rather than appearing as herself. However, this upbeat persona appeared to have deserted her when the topic of McVey was mentioned. Morgan went on to joke that if \u201clooks could kill, she\u2019d be six feet under\u201d, and added that he would \u201clove to hear the backstory\u201d. Asked about the exchange at her press conference later, McVey said: \u201cWe used to share a dressing room, and she used to do the programme afterwards. And obviously she used to be partnered with Eamonn Holmes. and then I was promoted to be partnered with Eamonn Holmes.\u201d \u201cBut she\u2019s great and it was a great show,\u201d she went on. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. I think it was 20 years ago I did that show, but never mind. It was really good at the time. It was really good fun.\u201d McVey, who was forced to apologise for misleading parliament while serving as work and pensions secretary, interviewed the likes of Martine McCutcheon and appeared on children\u2019s television introducing cartoons of the Muppets during her stint on screen. The MP for Tatton is running on a hard Brexit platform, threatening to sack pro-remain MPs from the cabinet in order to make sure the UK leaves the EU in October. However, it was not the worst broadcast slip-up to affect a Tory candidate on Monday morning, with the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire following the lead of many prominent journalists in broadcasting a sweary variation on Jeremy Hunt\u2019s surname."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
