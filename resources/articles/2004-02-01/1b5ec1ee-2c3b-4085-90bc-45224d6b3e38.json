Regan, who takes up his post on Monday, and many of the club chairmen believe the First Division should do more to try and cash in on the growing international popularity of English football, with the Premier League in particular drawing millions of viewers around the globe. One of the ideas being investigated by Regan is the formation of a representative First Division team to play exhibition matches in countries where English football is popular. The team would be made up of players from four or five leading clubs who would play games in the Middle East and China, the two areas identified by Regan as ripe for sponsorship opportunities. A source said: \"Many countries are hugely interested in English football but they don't know much outside the Premier League. There could be massive international interest in the First Division if overseas fans were made more aware that it provides entry to the Premier League. The First Division needs to raise its international profile and this will help attract sponsorship.\" The Coca-Cola deal is being viewed as the first of many as Regan also attempts to find a separate sponsor for the First Division. Plans are also being drawn up for sponsors for the Second and Third Divisions, and for further deals to fund the League's work in areas such as community programmes and educational initiatives. The three-year Coca-Cola contract, which is worth \u00a315m and will start from the 2004-2005 season, is the largest in the Football League's history and has been welcomed by clubs struggling since the collapse of ITV Digital. \"It is the best sponsorship deal the Football League has ever done,\" said Sir Brian Mawhinney, the League chairman. \"We share the revenue of the League with our clubs - that is what we are there for. The news is good for clubs. As this is a significant deal they can look forward to receiving a little more from us next season. \"Attracting a brand of the stature of Coca-Cola is clearly a coup for the League and demonstrates the enduring appeal of our competition. This partnership will contribute significantly to the proposed rebranding of the Football League.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
