Like him or not, Roth makes other horror directors look like a bunch of softcore wusses. With a sublimely irresponsible bad taste bordering on primitivist genius, he takes on the subjects of the Amazon rainforest and FGM \u2013 and it\u2019s far from clear by the end of the \u201cuniversity lecture\u201d scene on this subject that Roth actually understands what the sinister motivation for FGM is in the real world. A bunch of do-gooding US students head to South America to chain themselves to bulldozers belonging to the logging company destroying the rainforest. But to infiltrate the clearing site they have disguised themselves as company employees and so when they get lost and fall into the hands of the tribes themselves \u2026 an unfortunate misunderstanding takes place. The vengeful tribes themselves turn out to be cannibal savages, the stuff of rightwing reactionary fantasy. The heedless energy of Roth is impressive in its way and the \u201cmasturbation\u201d scene is a jaw-dropper. Perhaps he can now make a movie about homelessness, obesity and global warming."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
