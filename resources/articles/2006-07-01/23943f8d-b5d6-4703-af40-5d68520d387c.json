Daisy Goodwin's production company, Silver River, will oversee the dramatisation of Who Speaks for England, written by James Hawes, which will air on the BBC. This latest adaptation adds to the hefty workload of the dramatist, who is already occupied with half a dozen projects. His most recent successes included BBC1's Bafta award-winning drama Bleak House and The Line of Beauty for BBC2. Dan Hine of Silver River said: \"The script has been commissioned although it hasn't been written because Andrew is so busy. \"Creatively, there's nothing in writing so we don't know what direction Andrew's going to take. I shouldn't imagine that much of what Andrew does falls by the wayside. \"Harry Thompson, who started Silver River, loved the book but he passed away so Daisy and I optioned the book and approached James through his agent. \"Andrew is a fan of the book. He and James are Welsh and BBC Wales has commissioned it - so it all makes sense. \"It's a prestigious project for us. For Andrew it's a break from bodice-ripping costume dramas, although it's still saucy and naughty. He has a twinkle in his eye.\" Mr Hawes said: \"I couldn't be more delighted about Andrew's involvement. I'm staying well out of it because I want him to do what he does so well.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
