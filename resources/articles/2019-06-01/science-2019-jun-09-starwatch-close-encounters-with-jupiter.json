The configuration is known as opposition, as the sun is directly opposite the planet in the sky. This means the planet reaches its highest altitude (culminates) at or around midnight. However, for this particular opposition, that altitude is not large for many northern observers. From London, Jupiter will culminate at just 15 degrees in altitude so you will need a clear southern horizon to spot the brightly shining planet. There\u2019s also a beautiful conjunction on its way for the coming weekend. As Sunday becomes Monday, the full moon will meet Jupiter low in the southern sky. With a good southern horizon, the pair will be unmistakable. While the conjunction takes place in Ophiuchus, the serpent-bearer, it should be easy to spot red Antares in next door Scorpius. Then look to the east and you could glimpse Saturn near the \u201cteapot\u201d shape of Sagittarius. The chart shows the view looking south at midnight BST as Sunday 16 June becomes Monday 17 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
