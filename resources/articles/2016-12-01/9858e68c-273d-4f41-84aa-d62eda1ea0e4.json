Everton host the 227th Merseyside derby on Monday, having won only one of the last 19 league encounters and none of the last 12 meetings in all competitions. Koeman upset some Evertonians recently by describing Liverpool as potential title-winners this season but, before his first Merseyside derby, he claimed J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team are vulnerable. The Everton manager said: \u201cThe record is not good. One out of 19 \u2013 it\u2019s time to beat them. Of course every time you don\u2019t win, the one you will win comes closer. You need to accept how difficult it is to win the game but you need to make the fans happy. \u201cLiverpool are strong but they lost their way at Bournemouth and drew against West Ham. It is not so difficult because, if Bournemouth can win against them, we have possibilities to win, too. We need to press. I\u2019m not sure but I think Liverpool have conceded more goals than anyone ahead of us. Not so good.\u201d Liverpool and Everton have conceded the same number of goals in the Premier League this season: \u2013 20. Koeman has vast derby experience from his playing days in the Netherlands and Spain as well as his varied managerial career. \u201cMy favourite was between Barcelona and Real Madrid because the rivalry between Catalonia and Madrid meant it wasn\u2019t only about the football side but the political side,\u201d he said. Koeman won six of his 12 league games against Real as a Barcelona player and wants to balance out Everton\u2019s derby record, too. He added: \u201cI have a lot of good memories of the Cl\u00e1sico. In my first Cl\u00e1sico I scored two goals, two penalties. I needed to repeat one of the penalties, so really I scored three penalties. That was really fantastic because we won the game 3-1 and another time we won 5-0 at home to Madrid. I scored a great free-kick in that game, so that is a nice memory. I know I won more than one out of 19 Cl\u00e1sicos and we need to change that record.\u201d Koeman confirmed Everton will open talks over a new contract for Ross Barkley in the new year and insisted no club is \u201cknocking on the door\u201d for his players. Everton secured new deals on Friday for the veteran midfielder Gareth Barry, the defender Leighton Baines and the promising youngster Mason Holgate. Barry and Baines would have been out of contract at the end of this season \u2013 the reported four-year deal Baines signed in 2014 included a conditional final 12 months \u2013 while Barkley is under contract until 2018. Negotiations have not yet commenced on an extension for Barkley, with the England international enduring a difficult season under Koeman. That has created speculation over the midfielder\u2019s long-term future with his boyhood club. Tottenham Hotspur were linked with a bid this week but the Everton manager insisted the situation will be addressed after the hectic festive period. Koeman said: \u201cWe know he has about 18 months left. That\u2019s not the priority now. In the new year we will have talks about his situation and his future but the priority now is playing and winning and see what happens in January. I\u2019m not interested in what is said about the future of players. There is no one knocking on the door now about players from Everton.\u201d Koeman confirmed Yannick Bolasie has had surgery on a damaged meniscus but must wait eight to 10 weeks for an operation on his anterior cruciate ligament. The winger could be sidelined for a year, with the knee injury sustained against Manchester United earlier this month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
