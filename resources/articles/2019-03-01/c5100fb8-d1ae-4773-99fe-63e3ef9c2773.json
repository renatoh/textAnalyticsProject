It\u2019s a small reminder of the town\u2019s proud hippy heritage and laid-back lifestyle. But on a busy weekday morning the hand-painted words take on an ironic edge. Traffic regularly stretches up to 7km out of town at peak hour, slowing the eclectic cavalcade of local workers, van-packers and day tourists to a frustrating crawl. The road, designed for much smaller traffic volumes, is often littered with deep potholes. With voters going to the polls in the New South Wales election on 23 March, it is one of the key issues in the seat of Ballina, which covers the Byron and Ballina shires on the far-north coast and where the Greens edged out the National party at the last election by just 3%. More than two million visitors pour into the Byron shire alone each year, providing a fat slice of revenue for the NSW government through various fees and business levies. At the same time, a steady tide of sea-changers from Sydney and Melbourne is sweeping in with bulging banking balances and \u2013 in many cases \u2013 plans to buy a house and then let it out on Airbnb to pay off the mortgage. The result is a two-pronged attack on the local way of life, with local infrastructure \u2013 particularly roads \u2013 groaning under the weight of visitors on one hand, and housing affordability plunging to the point where the Byron shire has become the least affordable regional area in the country. There is a strong perception among voters that their region is contributing hundreds of millions to the NSW economy, but barely seeing a cent in return. \u201cPeople are definitely pissed off,\u201d says the editor of the Byron Shire Echo, Hans Lovejoy. \u201cThey\u2019re pissed off about the state of the roads, about holiday letting, and the cost and standard of living. \u201cPeople are pretty tuned in here. There\u2019s a very high level of political awareness that has a long history.\u201d The state government has done its best in the lead up to the election to make Ballina voters feel that they have not been forgotten. In the past 18 months a river of funds has flowed into the region, from $21m to build an alternative road into Byron Bay, to giving two old disused hospital sites over to the community. There has also been a series of policy announcements designed to make locals feel loved, including granting Byron council an exemption from the state\u2019s laissez faire holiday letting laws, and ensuring that the crackdown on drugs at music festivals did not affect Byron\u2019s famous blues festival. Standing front and centre at these funding and policy announcements has been the Coalition\u2019s candidate for Ballina, the Nationals\u2019 Ben Franklin. Currently a sitting member of the NSW upper house and the parliamentary secretary for renewable energy and the northern rivers, Franklin has a much higher profile than the relative unknown who stood for the Nationals, and lost, in 2015. A former state director of the National party, he has positioned himself as the man with the Macquarie Street connections and clout needed to ensure locals are well looked after. \u201cThe Nationals are desperate to win back this seat,\u201d says Lovejoy. \u201c[Nationals MP] Don Page held it for eons so it really stung [when they lost it last election].\u201d The incumbent MP, the Greens\u2019 Tamara Smith, describes the Nationals\u2019 strategy as \u201cblatant pork barrelling\u201d and Franklin as a \u201ccharming imposter\u201d. \u201cLook, going marginal is the best thing that happened to this area because having been completely ignored for decades we\u2019ve suddenly seen a 32% increase in funding,\u201d Smith says. \u201cBut it is absolutely clear what\u2019s going on and I think people will see right through it.\u201d \u201cAn upper house member is sent up here straight after they lose the seat in 2015, with a seemingly endless trust fund and a guaranteed spot in the upper house if he loses.\u201d Franklin, not surprisingly, takes umbrage at suggestions that the government is trying to \u201cbuy\u201d back the seat. \u201cWhat would they have me do if not advocate for the needs of the community?\u201d he asks. \u201cIf they\u2019re trying to suggest that I just sit back and do nothing, well that\u2019s unacceptable. Politics isn\u2019t just about making speeches, it\u2019s about outcomes.\u201d Franklin believes his advocacy on local issues will see him regain the seat for the Nationals. \u201cI think all the work I\u2019ve done for this community over the past four years has shown what sort of local member I\u2019ll be,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve listened, I\u2019ve advocated and then I\u2019ve delivered outcomes. I\u2019m in no way taking anything for granted but I hope people will hopefully view that positively and make me their local member.\u201d One issue of interest to Northern Rivers locals where the Nationals may struggle to get traction is climate change. A recent survey by the Nature Conservation Council found that 87% of people in the region wanted strong action to stave off climate change, and that concerns about deforestation also rated highly. It\u2019s partly a reflection of the region\u2019s history of environmental activism and partly the long-term demographic shift that has seen the traditionally conservative farming community increasingly make way for a more lifestyle-focused, entrepreneurial class. \u201cIt would be very strange to lose this seat given the level of community concern about those issues,\u201d Smith says of the survey results. Environmental concerns are also set to be a big issue in the neighbouring seat of Lismore, where the National party holds a narrow 2.9% margin over the Greens. They are facing an even tougher battle this time, with the retirement of long-standing incumbent MP Thomas George. His replacement is the relatively unknown local farmer Austin Curtin, the son of a local trauma surgeon. Taking him on is Greens candidate Sue Higginson, the former chief executive of the NSW Environmental Defenders Office. A local dry rice farmer with a reputation for taking on the big end of town, Higginson believes the major issues in her community are climate change, environmental degradation, social issues, and the Nationals\u2019 \u201cabandonment\u201d of the farming sector. \u201cI think this election is going to be a referendum on environmental and social justice,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are sick of the old politics by the old parties where vested interests and corporate donors hold sway.\u201d But for Natasha Garred, co-owner of PJ\u2019s Country Fruit and Veg in Lismore, politics takes a back seat to the need for a stronger local economy. Like many others who live and work in Lismore itself (the seat covers 13,000 sq kms from the Tweed shire in the east to Tenterfield in the west) Garred and her family are still feeling the effects of the floods that devastated the town in May 2017. \u201cWe need someone who\u2019s going to really support small business and encourage people to buy local, not just for businesses like ours but because that\u2019s where a lot of the jobs come from,\u201d she says. She doesn\u2019t feel that any of the parties truly reflect her interests. \u201cI feel torn. On one hand I can see that we need to take action on climate change because we\u2019re feeling the effects right now, but on the other hand we need someone who is really going to support local jobs and the economy because a lot of people here are doing it tough.\u201d The votes of people like Garred could be crucial in the broader context of the election. Should the Greens prevail in both Ballina and Lismore as some are predicting, Tamara Smith and Sue Higginson could form part of a block of lower house Greens and independents perhaps even holding the balance of power. It would be an outcome that would thrust the state\u2019s north-east into the centre of power \u2013 but whether that would be enough to satisfy local demands for better roads and affordable housing is an open question."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
