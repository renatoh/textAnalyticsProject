Predictably, he found that his name had already been painted out on the dressing-room locker. Worse could follow today when England erase his name from their likely starting line-up. Crawley is \"desperate\" to face Sri Lanka on the ground where he spent 11 seasons, but that possibility receded last night when England reported positively on the state of Mark Butcher's injured left knee. Butcher trained with it heavily strapped and was reported to have come through \"with no discomfort\". England will wait to see if he suffers a reaction. Optimistic intentions to make a definite ruling on Butcher's fitness yesterday, and so allow Crawley maximum time to prepare, were rightly jettisoned. There is no need to mollycoddle players to such a degree. The first time that Crawley steps out again at Old Trafford will be an emotional one, but it is just as likely to be for Hampshire in July than for England tomorrow. Sri Lanka will introduce the fit-again Dilhara Fernando, for his first game of the series, rather than risk playing Ruchira Perera, who is in the middle of the rehabilitation work demanded by the ICC on a suspect action. To play Perera, who bowled without umpires' intervention against the MCC at Chesterfield, would be a wild card, but Sri Lanka, one down entering the final Test, need just that. Darryl Foster, Sri Lanka's bowling coach, has advised that the risk is not worthwhile. Sri Lanka also named their squad for the NatWest triangular series yesterday and, as forecast, Muttiah Muralitharan will remain. Aravinda de Silva and Hashan Tillekeratne have been jettisoned, as has the off-spinning all-rounder Thilan Samaraweera and two quick bowlers, Perera and Eric Upashantha. Sri Lanka's batting has been shaken up for the one-day series, with Avishka Gunawardene and Naveed Nawaz and the middle-order batsman Chamara Silva all included. Paul Collingwood is confident of being fit for England's squad in the one-day series against India and Sri Lanka though he will miss Durham's championship match against Worcestershire, which starts at the Riverside today. Sri Lanka squad: S Jayasuriya (capt), M Atapattu, M Muralitharan, R Arnold, M Jayawardene, K Sangakkara, P Jayawardene, N Zoysa, U Chandana, D Fernando, Buddika Fernando, C Vaas, C Silva, A Gunawardene, N Nawaz, A Ganegama."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
