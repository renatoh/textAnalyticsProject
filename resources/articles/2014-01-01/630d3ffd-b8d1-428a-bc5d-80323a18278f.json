Imposing universal childcare as a cultural norm will both compromise many vital early attachment relationships essential for young children, and interfere with parents' essential parental learning process, thus merely stoking up intra-familial problems for the future, as children grow older. These considerable resources would be far better spent requiring more flexible working, bringing down the cost of living (especially housing), investing in parenting education and community-based parent and toddler groups, and implementing family friendly allowances and tax incentives, enabling one parent to stay at home for at least their child's first three years, if that is their preference \u2013 freeing up employment for the unemployed in the process. Shadow minister Lucy Powell is right that mass institutionalised childcare will \"have a deep impact on the wellbeing of children\" \u2013 but in exactly the opposite way to that which she is assuming. Dr Richard House Senior lecturer in early childhood studies, University of Winchester \u2022 Labour's pledge to make affordable childcare a priority, including 25 hours of free childcare for three- and four-year-olds for working parents, is very welcome but there is much to be done before the vision can become a reality. Currently there is 15 hours of free childcare for all three- and four-year-olds and for disadvantaged two-year-olds, but the rate of funding goes nowhere near covering the real cost of providing quality childcare. Before any political party can commit to extending the number of funded places it must undertake a consultation on the real cost of care and subsequently fund it adequately, otherwise childcare providers will withdraw from the market. Denise Burke United for All Ages and Good Care Guide \u2022 The right service at the right time for the right child underpins effective early intervention. A recent London Councils report shows that we need a diversity of responses. The report notes the group of young people (and families) who are likely to be receptive to these services are different than those who will need adoption, fostering or children's homes. There is an unspoken assumption that early intervention will reduce the need for these alternative, supplemental or substitute caring options. As the report observes, this is unlikely to be the case. Early interventions work for many but not all and often this other group of young people need safety, specialism and choice provided by fostering and children's homes. Local authorities need to find funds for early intervention and are looking for them through cutting expenditure on those services that provide subsequent interventions. Already many young people who become looked after have to suffer five or more placement changes in a year. It is not uncommon for a young person arriving at a children's home to have 30 or more. Early intervention also means the right service at the right time for these young people. The way to make the funds more effective for higher-level needs is by a needs-led national strategy that ensures matched and most appropriate placements. In that way we get stability. We are not seeing leadership for this policy direction from either national or local government. The shortsightedness of this will become apparent when we have too few children's homes.
