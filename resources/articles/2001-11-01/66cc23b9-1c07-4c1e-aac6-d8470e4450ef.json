A tasting visit to a Continental winery may be advertised as \"Gratuit\u00e9\" but try to get out without buying and they'll chop your legs off. You are never made to feel that way in Australia, that you are obliged to buy, although with so many lovely wines and with so little time to drink them, it is difficult not to. Fortunately, most of the restaurants in the Barossa, and the Hunter Valleys, are immensely civilised and allow BYO - Bring Your Own - which immediately improves the quality of the dining experience while simultaneously reducing the eventual bill. For instance, while in the Barossa we ate in the Park restaurant in Tanunda and had kangaroo. It was superb: tender and flavourful and the Park is so proud of its ability to cook either 'roo or steak to your requirements that if a customer complains about their meat, they get it free. The food for two came to A$76, the wine, a luscious Elderton '98 Shiraz had been bought at the cellar door earlier that day for A$22; a total that represented such a bargain that it seemed a shame not to have a second bottle. At Elderton's, you will get a guided tasting of their delicious wines in a small section of their front office. It could hardly be more different to some other wineries that specialise in cellar doors, particularly in the Hunter Valley, which is a more accessible area for many visitors to Australia given that it is about two hours by road north of Sydney. A great many of the 80 or more wineries in the Hunter have gone to great lengths to present their product in the best possible light and also to offer more than just tastings. This is useful, of course, if not everyone in your group is interested in a day-long tasting, and among the things on offer are cheese shops, bread bakeries, art galleries, olive, p\u00e2t\u00e9 and trout tastings, coffee shops, delicatessens, food and wine bookshops, children's playgrounds and picnic grounds. The Hunter is also home to the legendary Len Evans, OBE, Officer of the Order of Australia and Chevalier de l'Ordre Merit Agricole. Evans was born in Felixstowe, but emigrated in the mid-1950s and has become one of Australia's foremost men of wine. He is said to be the best after-dinner speaker in the southern hemisphere and has formulated his own rules for wine drinking. A few of them are: \u00b7 There is an awful lot of wine in the world but there is a lot of awful wine. \u00b7 To make the most of the time you have left, you must start by calculating your total future capacity. One bottle of wine per day is 365 per year. If your life expectancy is another 30 years, there are only 10,000-odd bottles ahead of you. \u00b7 People who say, \"You can't drink the good stuff all the time\" are talking rubbish. Every time you drink a bottle of inferior wine, it's like smashing a superior bottle against the wall. The pleasure is lost forever. You can't get that bottle back. \u00b7 There are people who build up huge cellars most of which they have no hope of drinking. They are foolish in overestimating their capacity but they err on the right side and their friends love them. \u00b7 There are also people who don't want to drink good wine and are happy with the cheapies. I forgive them. There are others who are content with beer and spirits. I can't worry about everybody. The Evans winery in the Hunter is at Tower Estate, and should you visit, there will be no obligation to buy. But you would be mad not to."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
