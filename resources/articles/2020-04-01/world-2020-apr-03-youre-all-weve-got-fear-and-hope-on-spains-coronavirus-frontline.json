The self-imposed strictures are painful but necessary. Health authorities across the country are scrambling to disinfect Spain\u2019s care homes, which have become one of the frontlines of the country\u2019s coronavirus crisis. To date, the virus has infected more than 100,000 people in Spain and claimed more than 10,000 lives. By Mar\u00eda\u2019s reckoning, 50 residents of the home near Madrid where she works have died in the past three weeks, while around 90 others are isolated in empty rooms. \u201cAll the tests on residents have come back positive so far,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen the doctor says how many tests were coming back positive, she said, \u2018My God! It\u2019s already too late to do something about this. We\u2019re probably all positive already.\u2019\u201d Even so, Mar\u00eda and her colleagues have yet to be tested \u2013 or properly equipped as they wash, dress, feed and take their charges to the bathroom. Masks have been provided, but they are having to improvise gowns out of rubbish bags. According to the CSIF public workers\u2019 union, two care home workers have died from the virus in the Madrid region and another 400 have become infected. Across Spain, health workers make up around 14% of all coronavirus cases. Madrid\u2019s regional government activated an emergency plan to deal with the situation on 26 March and has been sending health workers, civil protection staff and firefighters to assess and deal with the situation in each of the area\u2019s 470 care facilities. By Friday this week, emergency teams had visited 100 of them, according to a spokesman. On Thursday, Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, president of the Madrid region, said \u201caround 3,000\u201d people had died of various causes in the region\u2019s old people\u2019s homes during March. A week earlier, her administration said that 1,065 Madrid care home residents had died over the first three weeks of March. The disparity suggests a huge surge in fatalities in the past few days. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard being there and knowing there\u2019s nothing you can do and that they\u2019re dying, one after another,\u201d says Mar\u00eda. \u201cYou do what you can, but staff are getting sick and the home is running with a minimum of people.\u201d While staff try to muddle through, residents sit in isolation, some lucky enough to have mobile phones to speak to their families, some not. \u201cThey\u2019re stuck in their rooms, where they have to eat. They\u2019re confused and frightened because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201d Last week, Spain\u2019s defence minister revealed that soldiers from Spain\u2019s specialist military emergencies unit had found a number of elderly people abandoned and dead in their beds as they arrived to disinfect care homes. But the unit is not the only group to find itself tasked with trying to save lives by bleaching away the virus. Javier Mart\u00ednez Garc\u00eda has been a wildlife ranger for 14 years. Until recently, the worst situations he had found himself in were trying to stop forest fires in their tracks and dealing with violent gangs of mushroom hunters. For the past fortnight, however, he and a crew of fellow rangers and other volunteers have been working to disinfect care homes across the region of Soria, 230km northeast of Madrid. They, at least, have good kit: suits, gloves, face masks, goggles, hoods, rubber boots, and a backpack for the spray. \u201cWe try to be quite jolly when we go into a home,\u201d says Mart\u00ednez Garc\u00eda. \u201cWe say hello to everybody because it\u2019s pretty odd for the old people to see us dressed like that \u2013 they\u2019ve only seen the gear in movies and information films.\u201d The 50-year-old ranger has told his girlfriend about his volunteering duties, but not his parents \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t want them to know and to worry\u201d. Still, says Mart\u00ednez Garc\u00eda, the work of recent days has been an education; the fear he felt at first has been replaced by action and a sense of purpose. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a bit like fighting a fire: if you\u2019re not used to it, you worry because you\u2019re trying to figure out how to deal with something you\u2019ve never dealt with before. But once you\u2019ve put out a fire, you\u2019re calmer and you know what to do.\u201d Altogether more accustomed to fires like these is Luis Encinas. While he demurs at being called an expert on epidemics \u2013 \u201cI have a certain experience of outbreaks with low human resources and material and logistic limitations\u201d \u2013 the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res coordinator has seen more than a dozen outbreaks of haemorrhagic fever, including Ebola, and worked in war zones including Afghanistan and Angola. All of which makes it even odder to be deployed in his home country as the medical charity sets up temporary hospitals and works to take some of the pressure off Spain\u2019s desperately overstretched health system. \u201cYou want to support the system in your own country, but it\u2019s really, really strange,\u201d says Encinas. \u201cIt\u2019s a mix of sadness and a will to help. We worked in Spain during the migration crisis, but not on internal stuff.\u201d He doubts that any health system in the world would have had the capacity to cope with the pandemic, adding that Europe and other parts of the developed world haven\u2019t seen a crisis on this scale since the second world war or the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918. \u201cThat means we\u2019ve had generations who have grown up free and healthy and seen life expectancy rising each year,\u201d he says. \u201cSo now, it\u2019s \u2018Wow! How could I have imagined this?\u2019. \u201cToday, the focus is on saving lives and and prioritising when it comes to greatest need. But once this is all over and done, it\u2019ll be important to analyse this and learn the lessons.\u201d Among those lessons are humility, planning and preparation: \u201cLet\u2019s look at things so we can say what the plan will be if 40 Covid-19 patients arrive at my ER tomorrow? Or 400, or 4,000? What will the plan be?\u201d Mar\u00eda\u2019s personal plans extend little beyond trying to get through one day, steeling herself for the next, and keeping her levels of fear, fatigue and exposure as low as possible. \u201cI had a really bad day last week when a lot of people died and no one seemed to care. I was so tired and fed up that I came home and said, \u2018That\u2019s it. I need to take a few days off to rest and recover.\u2019\u201d Her teenage daughter had other ideas. She looked squarely at her mother and said: \u201cIf those grannies and grandfathers are going to die, they\u2019re going to die. But if you don\u2019t go, it\u2019ll be worse for them. You need to go and do whatever you can.\u201d The pep talk worked and Mar\u00eda is determined to hold on as best she can for as long as she can. After all, she and her dwindling band of colleagues are all the human contact that many residents have as they endure weeks of confinement, isolation, or worse. \u201cThe other day, one of the grannies, who hadn\u2019t seen her daughter for a fortnight, wanted to give me a hug and a kiss,\u201d says Mar\u00eda. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t because we\u2019re not allowed. She said, \u2018Well at least give me your hand then, sweetheart, because you\u2019re all we\u2019ve got.\u2019\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
