Laszlo Kovacs, EU tax commissioner, indicated he was drawing up plans to slash the number of reduced VAT rates allowed in the 27-member bloc. But he faces pressure from EU governments who want to promote family-friendly policies and jobs for the unskilled via lower sales taxes. A Treasury spokesman said: \"The UK's zero rates are worth over \u00a328bn to UK households each year. They are fully safeguarded under existing European agreements. We will not agree to proposals that would harm our social objectives or undermine the fairness of the UK VAT system.\" Britain applies a standard VAT rate of 17.5% but excludes items such as food, children's clothing, water, books and newspapers and prescribed drugs. The UK imposes a rate of 5% on domestic gas and electricity, renewable heating systems and women's sanitary products. EU countries are allowed to apply rates within a band of 15 to 25%, with Luxembourg at the lowest end and Belgium at 21.6%. Germany raised its rate three percentage points this year to 19% and the new French government, which wants reduced rates for restaurants, cafes and hotels, is considering a higher \"social\" VAT rate to switch taxation from employment to consumption. Mr Kovacs believes, at most, only reduced rates should be alllowed for locally produced services."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
