Then again, to be fair, the GMTV presenter never had to endure the indignity of having her right breast cupped or, indeed, her bottom groped by the 41-year-old shamelessly stern judge throughout the course of her survival on Strictly Come Dancing 'Oi!' shouts a bloke in a white van, eyeing Revel Horwood grappling with a mannequin, one hand up her skirt, the other stroking her left cheek, 'if you want a real woman I've got one in the back, mate.' Bashfully, the antipodean Simon Cowell, the BBC's prime-time pantomime villain, removes his hand from the dummy's thigh and laughs. 'No,' he says, 'you're all right. 'I'm more than happy with a plastic one, thanks.' Maybe it is simply seasonal goodwill but Revel Horwood, happily, is far more likable than his TV persona intimates. Not only is he willing to send himself up and, coat-less, chat to fans as the cold turns his nose red but, refreshingly, he makes no attempt to conceal his appetite for 'cheesy' tunes. 'Oh, my tastes are very cheesy,' he says, nursing a Diet Coke in the bar of the building where the Strictly spin-off show It Takes Two is filmed. 'Cheese' such as 'All I Want For Christmas is You', Mariah Carey's uber-naff 1994 hit, which Revel Horwood sang on a recent It Takes Two. Improbably, the Strictly star's rendition reminded one of Record Doctor's friends of Ian Curtis, whose jerky, flailing movements Revel Horwood seemed to ape. 'Good,' he says. He laughs nervously, patently unsure of how best to react to a comparison with Joy Division's singer, who even had he not died 28 years ago would probably never have agreed to dance the pasa doble with a leggy lovely under Revel Horwood's gaze. 'I'll take that as a compliment. That's the thing with me though - I'm quite odd. I like stuff like Joy Division and Verdi, and then some naff stuff.' When Revel Horwood says he likes Joy Division he is being a trifle disingenuous: his iPod contains not a single track of theirs. But then as might be expected of a man who is one of the stars of a show that has approximately 12 million viewers, he is a populist who, Bowie aside, has long been bemused by the garish charms of glam rock and the year zero doctrine championed by punk ('Ugh! What, like Sid Vicious? No thanks!'). And while it would be wrong to claim he loathes all loud music ('I love the Prodigy's \"Smack My Bitch Up\"'), metal offends everything that he holds dear. 'I've tried to like it, I really have. But to me, it all sounds like this.' He pulls a face that is two parts Ozzy Osbourne to one part Scary Spice told she can't fly business class. 'Bleeuurrrgghhh!' he screams, poking out his tongue, attracting glances from the table opposite. Perhaps Revel Horwood's hatred of music that boasts an excess of testosterone can be traced to his formative years. He grew up in Ballarat, north-west of Melbourne, whose male residents were, by and large, 'ockers'. 'You know, geezers. No, more than that - wife-beaters.' There, short and slightly plump, and useless at sport, he started dancing in order to lose weight, falling in love with, first, classical music then disco, primarily thanks to Saturday Night Fever. 'That made me aware of music's power. There was a boy in my class who could do the moves and I thought, Wow! I want to be like him.' As a rule, he loves songs full of 'mystery and drama', foremost among them 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. 'That spoke to both my pop and classical sides so I could really relate to it.' But what, asks Record Doctor, were Queen going on about? 'No idea,' he says, as if such a query were the height of impertinence. 'But that doesn't matter. Freddie Mercury made a lot of sense to me even though I didn't understand the lyrics.' Mercury is that rare thing - a male singer whom Revel Horwood loves. Not only are women better vocalists, he thinks, but - in the case of Cher, especially - the kind of contestants that Strictly Come Dancing needs. 'Can you imagine?' he says. 'She'd be bitchy and acerbic. Fabulous.' Mercury, to be fair, would have been quite decent too. 'But who would've been his partner? He'd have taken over the show.' And that just wouldn't do. Besides which, not all its guests can be twinkle-toed. Which is why he'd like to see Westlife on the show. 'Well, what can they do? All their songs involve them sitting on a bar stool, walking away and climbing back on again. Maybe it's just me,' he says, tired of being polite, readying his merciless small screen alter ego, 'but they'd be bloody hopeless, wouldn't they?' Craig Revel Horwood is a judge on the Strictly Come Dancing Live! tour, which is touring the UK until 19 February The symptoms: His favourites Gloria Gaynor I Will Survive (Polydor) 'This is my anthem. It's the kind of disco that always gets me up on the floor. I absolutely love it. It was particularly important to me when I came out, of course, it being such a gay anthem.' Phil Collins Against All Odds (Atlantic) 'I really love the lyrics, though I can't pick out one line in particular. I can't say I'm a fan of his other stuff but I also like the Westlife version of this song, which they did with Mariah Carey. I wouldn't like to hear them sing it by themselves, mind.' Oleta Adams Get Here (Spectrum) A friend of mine died very early, and this was the song we chose to sing for him. So I have very fond memories of it. Again, it's a very positive song - and I like positive. Although, having said that... Amy Winehouse Rehab (Island) 'I love this not so much for what she's saying but the tone of her voice. It's just beautiful. Really beautiful. Like Christina Aguilera, she's a white girl with a lot of soul. It's sad that her problems have been exploited by the tabloids but slowly, I think, she is starting to cope.' The diagnosis Granted, it is quite a long shot, but the Doctor thought that maybe, just possibly, the Patient's antipathy towards punk and metal might be cured by Frank Carter's Gallows ('In the Belly of a Shark'), who combine the best of both genres. As for Adele ('My Same'), the teenage Londoner who has been described as 'the new Amy Winehouse' by pretty much everyone who has heard one of her tracks, she ticks all the Patient's criteria, being a gifted woman with populist appeal. The Doctor reasoned, too, that the Patient couldn't help but fall for Muse, whose 'Soldier's Poem', like the rest of their canon, is indebted to Queen's operatic rock. Finally, as disco is, quite possibly, the Patient's favourite music in the world, he was sent two contrasting tunes rooted in the form. The first, Hot Chip's 'Ready For the Floor', is a synthesis of Giorgio Moroder and pop that wears its weediness with pride. The second, 'Friendly Fires' by Friendly Fires, the hotly tipped three-piece from glamorous St Albans, hurls squealing guitars and old-school house into the mix, as if loath to align itself with either rock or dance. The cure It probably won't come as too much of a surprise, given his regard for female vocalists, that the Patient was most taken by Adele. 'Yeah, I liked her. Very Amy Winehouse, which is probably what appealed. It reminded me, too, of [US Seventies/Eighties star] Phoebe Snow, who I love.' The track that most made him want to dance, though, was the 'brilliant' 'Soldier's Poem' by Muse (right). 'If I was making a film, I'd probably have someone doing a Viennese waltz to it while people were getting killed.' Somewhat predictably, the Patient neither knows nor cares what Gallows' message is. 'I hated it. Actually, I thought it was OK when it changed gear into 4/4, but it hasn't changed my mind about punk.' He is equally steadfast in his view that disco peaked roughly 30 years ago. 'Friendly Fires were dull, and I wouldn't really sit down and listen to Hot Chip. Still, at least you could do a decent cha-cha-cha to it.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
