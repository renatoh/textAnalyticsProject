The Tote give Archduke Ferdinand a 12-1 quote, and group Mr Dinos along with Fantasy Hill, Harlestone Grey and Sarangani as their 8-1 co-favourites. The lightly-weighted Mr Dinos must have a great chance if he feels no ill effects after his fine effort at Royal Ascot last week. He was running on well when going under by just half a length to Mamool in the two-mile Queen's Vase and the Newcastle marathon looks tailor-made for him. Riyadh, an impressive winner under Kieren Fallon at the Royal meeting, heads a two-pronged challenge by champion jumps trainer Martin Pipe, who also runs the progressive hurdler Polar Red. Pipe said: \"Riyadh was given a terrific ride by Kieren Fallon at Ascot - he's a great jockey. He has come out of the race well and is due to run at Newcastle with Fallon riding once again. We will check the horse out throughout the week but he seems fine.\" Polar Red has not been seen on the track since finishing a disappointing 13th in the Vincent O'Brien County Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival back in March. He impressed when winning the Sunderlands Imperial Cup at Sandown earlier that month and Pipe added: \"Polar Red will also run for Sir Stanley Clarke, who runs the racecourse.\" Jessica Harrington has left in the six-year-old Evening Scent and she is the only possible Irish representative in the stayers' prize. Tote Chester Cup winner Fantasy Hill is also among the 29 acceptors as is Amanda Perrett's former Chester Cup winner Bangalore. Fantasy Hill is one of four possible John Dunlop runners along with Harlestone Grey, Taffrail and Caqui d'Or. Sarangani from Mick Easterby's yard and Mary Reveley's Tees Components head the northern defence. Aidan O'Brien reports Vodafone Derby winner High Chaparral to be in good order ahead of his tilt at Sunday's Classic at the Curragh. The son of Sadler's Wells will be bidding to follow up his two length Epsom success over Hawk Wing. If he can complete the double he will emulate stablemate Galileo, who took both derbies for the same owner and trainer last season. O'Brien was forced to withdraw his three intended runners at Longchamp yesterday because they all returned bad blood counts but he says his Derby hero has pleased connections in the lead up to the race. \"High Chaparral is very well and we were happy with his final piece of work for the Derby which he completed on Saturday morning.\" said the trainer. He also confirmed that the 2,000 Guineas third Della Francesca is on course for the race along with Italian Derby runner-up Ballingarry. O'Brien has hinted he may also run another contender as he has a total of 17 horses among the 41 preliminary entries, including unlikely runners Rock Of Gibraltar and Hawk Wing, who could be aimed at the Coral Eurobet Eclipse Stakes at Sandown. Also among the entries is French Derby runner-up Act One, who was owned by the late Gerald Leigh, and Dermot Weld's In Time's Eye, who ran on well to finish second to High Chaparral in the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial at Leopardstown."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
