Not content with 8,500 acres of country estate in Wiltshire, Persson is planning to bolster his sizeable property portfolio by snapping up an entire English village. The world's 16th-richest man is preparing to buy the 2,000 acre Linkenholt estate near Andover, Hampshire, for \u00a325m. It comes complete with an Edwardian-style manor house, 1,500 acres of farmland, a 425-acre wood, a cricket ground and 21 cottages leased to villagers. According to property sources the deal follows an intense bidding war with other wealthy would-be buyers, undaunted by the turbulent property market. Persson, whose wealth is estimated at \u00a311.4bn, is thought to have had an offer accepted at the top end of the \u00a323-25m guide price. Since the 1970s, the estate \u2013 which was put up for sale in March \u2013 has been run by a charitable trust after its last owner, Herbert Blagrave, an entrepreneur, died childless. Rents for properties range from \u00a3500 a month for a modest cottage to \u00a33,500 for the manor house. Shooting rights should also prove lucrative for the 61-year-old fashion tycoon, who counts the king and queen of Sweden among his friends. Persson, who last hit the headlines when he cancelled Kate Moss's modelling contract with H&amp;M following allegations about her drug use, also owns a \u00a39m country estate near Marlborough in Wiltshire. H&amp;M, or Hennes &amp; Mauritz, was founded by Persson's father, Erling, in 1947, and has more than 1,800 stores across the world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
