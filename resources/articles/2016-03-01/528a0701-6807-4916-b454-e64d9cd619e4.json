City defeated Liverpool in the Capital One Cup final on Sunday to claim the first trophy of the campaign. Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s team face J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side again on Wednesday at Anfield. Kompany feels the closing phase of the season allows City to play with the shackles released. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned in our recent history is that moment likes this you just have to get your head down and start racing as much as you can,\u201d the captain said. \u201cIt\u2019s what we call the hunting season now so we\u2019re not going to look back or do anything other than focus on the opponents that we have to play. We just have to make sure that everything we have we leave on the pitch. There\u2019s no other way to approach this any more. You can\u2019t come with mathematics or anything like this. \u201cWe just have to race to the end and see how many of the 36 points we still have to play for we can bag and we\u2019ll be close if we have a lot of them. It\u2019s an awkward time of the year \u2013 it\u2019s almost as if we have nothing to lose any more. We still have a lot to play for but nothing to lose any more. It\u2019s like all the gates come off. That\u2019s how it felt with the performance in [the 3-1 win over Dynamo] Kyiv and against Liverpool at the weekend and that\u2019s the feeling we have the recreate for Wednesday. \u201cJust take all the gates off and go for it. It\u2019s a little bit less calculated and probably more entertainment value for people watching but it\u2019s the only way for us to get there now because we\u2019re in a trailing position. It\u2019s a weird feeling but it\u2019s hunting season so it\u2019s better to be chasing than be chased in some ways. \u201cThe whole organisation, everyone at the club, has to have the knife between the teeth and know that everyone needs to be as sharp and focused as ever. It\u2019s not just the players but the way we all behave. We can get to something special.\u201d Kompany has made three appearances after returning from his latest serious calf injury. He dismissed any notion this was career threatening. \u201cIt\u2019s life and I never look at a situation where I\u2019ve had injuries and look at it as something I can\u2019t overcome,\u201d he said. \u201cI look at it as a challenge and I put in the work. I always think to myself: \u2018It\u2019s not the first time someone has said I\u2019m finished because of an injury.\u2019 There\u2019s nothing more exciting than to show people that I\u2019m there again and if anything I\u2019m better. It\u2019s a drive for me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
