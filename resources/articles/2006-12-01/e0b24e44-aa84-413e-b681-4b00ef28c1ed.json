In the latest disaster afflicting African job seekers sailing to Spain's Canary Islands, about a dozen survivors were in the clinic in this northern Senegal town, the only facility outside the capital, Dakar, advanced enough to cope with some of the worst cases, officials said. Relatives waiting outside the hospital spoke of the poverty that forced their loved ones to risk a treacherous sea journey in search of work. Associated Press in St Louis, Senegal Car bomb attacks target foreign oil companies Near-simultaneous blasts tore through two oil company facilities in southern Nigeria yesterday. Two private security workers said a blast hit an Agip residential compound in Port Harcourt and Shell Oil reported an explosion at company facilities in the city, where many foreign oil workers live. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta claimed responsibility, saying before the explosions that it had planted three car bombs. The militant group vowed to continue its year-long struggle to boost regional control over oil funds. There were no reports of casualties.
