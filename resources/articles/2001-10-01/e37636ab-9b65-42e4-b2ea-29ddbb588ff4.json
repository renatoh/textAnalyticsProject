I already have a non- student facility with overdraft and debit card. Previously, when I was working, I banked with Barclays where I had an overdraft. My local Co-op Bank branch said I could not have a student account because I do not hold a British passport. The only way I can have a student account is to give up my existing overdraft facility and agree to have an account without borrowing - but the overdraft is the only reason to have a student account in the first place. All this because I do not have a British passport. I am classed as a home student for fees and student loans purposes, having lived in the UK for five years. Discriminating against students on nationality grounds does not seem ethical. How can I have the full benefits of a student account together with an ethical outlook? HA, Cambridge Banks are not obliged to open accounts. But there is certainly no blanket ban on non-UK passport holders - banks, including the Co-op, are sensitive to suggestions they may be contravening the Race Relations Act. Nevertheless, banks can and do discriminate against foreigners on credit scoring grounds - they will not be on the voting register, and they are unlikely to have lived very long at their present address. However, your case is strange. You already have a Co-op account with full borrowing facilities so the only explanation for you being turned down was that a local branch clerk ignored your previous record, looked in the bank's manual and decided your lack of a UK passport equalled a turndown. It treated you as a non-customer instead of a customer. Your local branch refused to change its mind early this week. But following a Capital Letters intervention, the bank's headquarters will contact you. It will tell you to reapply for a student account, which should then be opened for you."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
