Stewart, who is understood to have drafted a concession speech before unexpectedly scraping through the first round on Thursday, earned one vote fewer than Matt Hancock and four less than Sajid Javid. His campaign said it showed momentum was behind him due to his public appeal, despite being the lowest-scoring of the seven candidates to go through to the second round. In a plea to supporters of Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove, Stewart\u2019s backer, the justice secretary, David Gauke, suggested they would not have a chance of beating Johnson in the final round. \u201cA safe pair of hands is not going to beat Boris Johnson,\u201d he said. Stewart said he was \u201cabsolutely over the moon\u201d to have secured enough votes to go through and said he would be reaching out to \u201cevery single colleague\u201d to persuade them to back him. He said if Johnson attempted to prorogue parliament, he and other MPs would be prepared to \u201cbring him down\u201d. \u201cIf he were to try, I and every other member of parliament, will sit across the road in Methodist Central Hall and we will hold our own session of parliament,\u201d he said. Campaign sources for Hunt, Gove and Javid conceded there was now a race for second place behind Johnson, who won 114 votes, well ahead of his rivals. However, in the immediate aftermath, no campaign appeared willing to try to thrash out a consensus behind one candidate. Gauke said colleagues who wanted to properly challenge Johnson should back Stewart because of his engagement with the public, demonstrated in a campaign that has been dominated by shaky handheld videos of Stewart meeting members of the public in different cities. \u201cHere, there is a comparison to be made with Boris \u2013 Rory has that ability to connect with the public, he has got that authenticity that the public respond to really well, and he is the one capable of causing surprises,\u201d said Gauke. \u201cIt\u2019s very clearly going to be Boris versus someone else. Boris is the overwhelming favourite. Rory is an unconventional candidate and he is the only one who could pull off a surprise. He is the only other candidate that people are talking about in the supermarket queues.\u201d Gauke said he believed there was still \u201cquite a lot of hidden support there for Rory\u201d, who won votes from 19 Tory MPs \u2013 12 more than had publicly declared support for him. Stewart\u2019s camp has also been buoyed by a poll of party members from ConservativeHome that put him as second favourite, albeit more than 40 points behind Johnson. However, party critics have pointed out he has failed to gain any momentum from the bloc of party moderates, with most of his backing coming from personal friendships such as those with Gauke and the Tory grandee Nicholas Soames, as well as the handful of Tory MPs who have consistently opposed a hard Brexit. \u201cHe may be hoping to pick up Matt [Hancock\u2019s] support if he drops out of the race, but the reality is it would be humiliating to back the only candidate who got fewer votes than you,\u201d one MP said. \u201cHe is getting better polling because people are starting to know who he is. That does not mean MPs think he has any chance at all. And most MPs will not be around until the next round of voting, most will be trying to switch off their phones over the weekend and get away from all the horse trading.\u201d But Stewart\u2019s backers believe he can capitalise on the planned TV debates, one of which is being hosted by Channel 4 on Sunday. Johnson\u2019s team has not confirmed whether he will take part, though the pressure on him from his rivals is mounting. Amber Rudd, Hunt\u2019s most high-profile backer, said it was essential that candidates committed to taking part in public debate. \u201cI want them all to do the TV debates. Jeremy has said he wants to participate, he\u2019s still in negotiations, but the key thing is that all the candidates get out to TV debates,\u201d she said. \u201cI keep on saying the fact is, the Conservative party needs to remember that we\u2019re not just choosing a leader, we\u2019re choosing a prime minister, and the public need to see them. I think they\u2019ve got a duty to do it \u2013 to be publicly interrogated.\u201d It is unclear, however, whether Hunt will take part in a debate if Johnson does not attend. Sources close to the foreign secretary have said he believes all candidates should take part \u2013 but would not commit to participating if his closest rival is empty-chaired. In a video thanking supporters, Gove said there should be a \u201cproper debate about ideas\u201d in the party, suggesting he too would be piling pressure on Johnson to take part in the debates."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
