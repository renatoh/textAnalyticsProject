He was hired both to modernise the FA and to update its rather old-fashioned image, and with his background as a marketing man, which is his greatest strength, he fulfilled both tasks. He has done a huge amount to push football in this country forward. He was brought in to deal with a fundamental problem that the FA faced that is common to many governing bodies, the oversized and unwieldy committee structure. He achieved that by pushing through the change from the old 92-man committee to the slimmed-down 12-man executive board, with representatives of both the amateur and the professional games sitting on it. The irony for Adam is that despite having created this board to speed up decision-making his failure to always consult them appears to have been his downfall. The structure of the FA must have been frustrating for him. In the commercial world you make decisions on a daily basis and then act on them. In sport, however, these decisions have to be taken back to committees and rubber-stamped. Over a period of time his failure to do that, particularly over the deal he has struck on behalf of the England players, caused these divisions. For all the differences of opinion inside the FA, it is worth reflecting on his achievements. Over Wembley particularly, I think Adam's influence was central in pushing it through to a successful conclusion. Just over a year ago he took a more hands-on role and as soon as he did the whole project moved forward. He was a key individual in getting the stadium signed off and in years to come he can be proud of that. From the FA's point of view they will have to get someone in quickly to keep an eye on the progress of the stadium as the building work begins. Wembley has its own board, but given the FA's financial commitment they will need someone in there to continue Adam's work. His other significant achievement was the appointment of Sven-Goran Eriksson to the England manager's job. There were mixed opinions about Sven when he was hired but it has to be seen as a positive step and a success for both manager and chief executive. The future does look a little uncertain now for Sven. He and Adam have been hugely supportive of each other over the last few months. Adam has stood by Sven through the disappointing results and the publicity about his private life and I think Sven will view Adam's departure as a negative as he considers his future over the next few months. The question that will be concerning many in football today is whether Adam's resignation signals a power shift towards the professional game. It is important that the FA establishes quickly exactly what this does mean for the game. From the outside it looks as though the professional elements, led by the Premier League chairmen, are more powerful than ever. I know people will be concerned that even more of the money from television and sponsorship could leak away from the grass roots and into the players' wage packets. I have worked with both the Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore and his chairman Dave Richards on the Football Foundation and they both have a real feeling for the grass roots of football, but it is crucial from a PR point of view that they now show that. None of these issues can really be tackled until the FA itself has worked out where it goes from here. First on the agenda should be writing a job description for Adam's successor. No one will throw their hat into the ring until they know what the job entails, and one wonders if the FA really knows yet. Adam was handed an ultimatum that, had he accepted it, would have tied his hands. Unless the FA are willing to give a free role to the new man I can't see them attracting high-quality applicants. But it is crucial that whoever eventually takes the job ensures the FA's influence does not dwindle to a secondary role behind professional interests. The FA is the governing body and it needs to retain power and influence to protect the game at all levels. If the grass roots whither the whole game will die."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
