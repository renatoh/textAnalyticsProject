Unveiling the so-called \"spidergrams\" - which cost the Home Office \u00a370,000 to develop - the police minister, John Denham, rejected suggestions that the public would be bamboozled by their complexity. The spidergrams show how each police force is performing compared to similar forces elsewhere in England and Wales. The new method of measuring performance makes it impossible to create a national league table of forces - opposed for years by chief constables. Asked if he thought the diagrams would be comprehensible to the public, Mr Denham said: \"Yes I do. As people get familiar with this type of graphical presentation they will realise it contains a lot of data that can be understood after an initial glance. \"It is much easier to comprehend than trying to look at a lot of figures on a table.\" Much of the data used to compile the diagrams has already been published, much of it in the British crime survey. The Association of Police Authorities (APA), which monitors the performance of police forces, gave a cautious welcome to the publication of the figures. Ruth Henig, the APA chairwoman, said they supported any new means of providing information to the public and could help them judge and compare police performance more effectively. \"Too often the police are judged solely on whether crime figures have gone up or down. That is over-simplistic,\" she said. The director of the police standards unit, Kevin Bond, claimed a new system was set to become \"the primary and most powerful medium through which comparative policing performance information is communicated\". He added: \"Although the form of the monitors can initially be unfamiliar, the basic concept is far from difficult to get used to and a lot of information underlies such a simple diagram.\" The spidergrams feature a blue pentagon divided by five axes representing different aspects of police performance, such as crime numbers, detections and fear of crime. The blue pentagon represents average performance of between three and seven similar forces. For example, metropolitan forces are compared with other city police services, and rural areas are compared with other rural forces. A black line overlaid on the pentagon shows how each force is performing. If the line rests inside the blue area on any of the five axes the force is underperforming. If it lies outside the blue zone the force is doing better than others in the group. Ministers stressed that there could be no comparisons at national level, unlike the government's league tables for schools and hospitals. Mr Denham said: \"The monitors cannot be used to make national comparisons between police forces or to construct league tables.\" He said additional categories would be added to the diagrams in future, making them more complicated. These may include serious and organised crime, domestic crime, anti-social behaviour and front line policing. Denis O'Connor, vice president of the association of Chief Police Officers and Chief Constable of Surrey, said ACPO supported the new monitors. He said it brought a \"wide angle lens\" to looking at the subject and also meant an \"at a glance\" picture could be provided. He added: \"A lot of people find lots of figures bewildering.\" But the shadow home secretary, Oliver Letwin, condmened the move in its entirity: \"More monitoring, more performance targets, more confusing statistics and more bureaucratic reporting requirements for the police. \"This will not aid the fight against crime, it will merely multiply bureaucracy.\" The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Simon Hughes said: \"These diagrams might be useful for internal monitoring, but they don't do much for the public's understanding of policing. \"No one is claiming that league tables were perfect, but at least they provided a crude comparison. They allowed us to have a public debate about the differences between forces. This new system appears to be built by bureaucrats, for bureaucrats.\" The chairwoman of the Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, Jan Berry, said: \"The best that can be achieved with monitors is they act as a general guide to performance and demonstrate where priorities and resources might need to be focused. \"Indicators alone will never capture the whole picture of policing since much of the work that is carried out never gets measured. \"As a result, the figures cannot be used to construct national league tables.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
