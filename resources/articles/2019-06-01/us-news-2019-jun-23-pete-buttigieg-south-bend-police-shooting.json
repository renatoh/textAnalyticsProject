Buttigieg agreed that an external investigation should take place into the fatal shooting of Eric Logan, a 54-year-old black man, by a white police officer, Sgt Ryan O\u2019Neill. Prosecutors investigating said that the shooting was not recorded by O\u2019Neill\u2019s body camera. The presidential hopeful said he would send a letter to the federal Department of Justice\u2019s civil rights division and notify the local prosecutor that he\u2019d like an independent investigator appointed. He conceded that his administration had failed on two key initiatives. \u201cThe effort to recruit more minority officers to the police department and the effort to introduce body cameras have not succeeded and I accept responsibility for that,\u201d Buttigieg said. The town hall grew contentious when some community members questioned whether the mayor had done enough to reform the police department in the city of 100,000 people, which is about a quarter black. \u201cGet the people that are racist off the streets,\u201d one woman in the audience said. \u201cReorganize your department. You can do that by Friday.\u201d Buttigieg acknowledged the South Bend police department had fallen short in recruiting minority police officers and introducing body cameras. Buttigieg left the campaign trail after the shooting to respond to issues of race and policing. On Friday he left other Democrats in South Carolina and flew back to South Bend, where a tense meeting ensued with family members of the dead man and protesters. He went back to South Carolina to speak alongside other candidates on Saturday, then returned home again. Buttigieg, 37, has surged from obscurity to regularly place in the top five of national and state polls of the sprawling Democratic presidential field. On Sunday the realclearpolitics.com average of national polls placed him equal fourth on 7.1% with the California senator Kamala Harris. Former vice-president Joe Biden, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren were in the top three slots. Buttigieg\u2019s national visibility has placed greater scrutiny on his record in office in South Bend, particularly with regard to police affairs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
