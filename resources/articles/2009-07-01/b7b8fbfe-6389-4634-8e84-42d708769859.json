Until recently, deck shoes were the province of the kind of pink-cheeked Al or Olly you see in the VIP enclosure at the polo, bellowing into Prince Harry's ear about the quality of the \"totty\". If you weren't them, you steered clear, unless you were on a boat. My father wore them, on the motor cruiser that blighted my teenage life. Dad declined to learn to sail before he bought it, or afterwards, preferring to plough into any vessel that got in his way. Whenever I see a pair of deck shoes, I think of those traumatic Sundays spent cowering below decks, while the air around Staines Marina filled with splinters of wood, smoke belching from crippled engines and the screams of the drowning. So I'm a tough nut to crack when it comes to being convinced of the new-found stylistic merits of the deck shoe. Apparently they're not just for honking poshos, after all. They're a design classic, which I suppose they are in that they haven't changed their appearance since Paul Sperry designed them 74 years ago. They've been back in vogue with a certain kind of hipster for a while, and now men's mags are going overboard trying to drum up interest. \"Think Jay Gatsby,\" said one, which is far more glamorous than thinking of Olly braying his way down Kings Road, or of my dad's approach to matters nautical. It's also anachronistic: at risk of sounding like a pedant, Jay Gatsby was invented in 1925, a whole decade before the deck shoe. \u2022 Alexis wears deck shoes, \u00a335, by asos.com.
