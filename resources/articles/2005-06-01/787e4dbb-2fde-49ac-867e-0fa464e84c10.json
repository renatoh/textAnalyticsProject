The British Potato Council has written to the Oxford English Dictionary to ask for it to be taken out. It has also planned demonstrations outside the offices of the Oxford University Press and in Parliament Square in London today to demand that it be replaced with the term \"couch slouch\". Kathryn Race, the head of marketing at the council, said: \"We are trying to get rid of the image that potatoes are bad for you. The potato has had its knocks in the past. \"Of course, it is not the Oxford English Dictionary's fault but we want to use another term because potatoes are inherently healthy.\" According to the dictionary, the term was introduced in the UK as American slang meaning: \"A person who spends leisure time passively or idly sitting around, especially watching television or video tapes.\" John Simpson, the editor of the dictionary, said the phrase was first included in 1993. The first record of it was in an article in the Los Angeles Times in 1979. He said: \"When people blame words they are actually blaming the society that uses them. Dictionaries just reflect the words that society uses. We monitor words in the language and what's out there. Our dictionaries describe - not prescribe.\" He said words were never taken out of the full-length dictionary, but that little-used words could be removed from the smaller dictionaries to make way for more up-to-date ones. \"I sympathise with them. It's not much fun being called Simpson after the birth of Bart and Homer,\" he said. \"However, couch potato will stay. We do not leave out words. Once a word is included in the big dictionary, it stays there. \"That's not the case for smaller dictionaries and if a word becomes less widespread it will be omitted from future editions - but it's not the time for that at the moment.\" He added: \"We will indicate if a word is slang and not standard English. We will not indicate whether it's good English or not.\" The campaign was supported by Nigel Evans, the Conservative MP for the Ribble Valley, Lancashire, who has tabled a motion in Parliament to support the term's removal. The celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson, another supporter, said the campaign would \"bring goodness back to the word potato\". \"Not only are they healthy, they are versatile, convenient and taste great too,\" he said. \"Life without a potato is like a sandwich without filling.\" The council said its campaign was also supported by dieticians who acknowledge that the vegetable is low in fat and high in vitamin C."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
