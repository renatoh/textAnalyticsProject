Although buoyed by last Sunday\u2019s 2-0 home win against Liverpool, McClaren\u2019s side are still in the bottom three and face a tough game at Tottenham on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy football club, as you and we all know, but that\u2019s the situation we\u2019re in,\u201d said the former England coach, who has had to conform to the often rigid policies imposed by Mike Ashley, Newcastle\u2019s owner. \u201cI think the players know that and I think the new ones that came in during the summer are adapting to that. I think it can be a culture shock to them but I fully expect us to be stronger in the second half of the season than we\u2019ve been in the first half.\u201d After beating Liverpool several Newcastle players looked so exhausted they were almost crawling off the pitch. \u201cI\u2019ve got to say it\u2019s what everybody should be doing every week,\u201d said McClaren, who was delighted to see certain individuals finally give everything for the cause. He denied it was a case of foreign imports not understanding what the club meant to its fans and the wider city. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, no,\u201d said the 54-year-old. \u201cDefinitely not. I think everybody knows what Newcastle is about. We show them films about the club and its history. It\u2019s not rocket science \u2013 but every club is saying the same thing.\u201d In McClaren\u2019s case he does not merely have to motivate cocooned millionaire players from sometimes far-flung corners of the globe but ensure they can withstand the pressure of performing in front of such large, sometimes demanding crowds. \u201cWhen you cross the while line here and there\u2019s 52,000 people \u2013 you\u2019ve got to have some courage to do that. I admire the players for that, for being able to handle it. The reason we\u2019re in the trouble that we\u2019re in is that they haven\u2019t been able to put in a performance week in, week out which the fans expect.\u201d This problem has been exacerbated by Newcastle\u2019s policy of not signing anyone aged over 26. A consequent lack of leadership and experience has prefaced some awful results in recent weeks and informed McClaren\u2019s decision to omit Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ayoze P\u00e9rez, two young strikers, for Liverpool\u2019s visit. Considering Mitrovic, a Serbia striker, cost \u00a314m when he joined from Anderlecht last summer and P\u00e9rez is much coveted, it was a big call. Not to mention the correct one. \u201cOne of the reasons we probably got the win was that with Papiss Ciss\u00e9 and Siem de Jong up front the team was a little bit more experienced,\u201d he said, dropping Ashley and the rest of the club\u2019s hierarchy a not so subtle hint. \u201cWith them coming back into the team our average age shot right up. Leading from the front, they actually made a big difference to us in terms of mentality and their experience of the big occasions. We decided to go for a bit of experience in Siem and Papiss and they worked well together.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
