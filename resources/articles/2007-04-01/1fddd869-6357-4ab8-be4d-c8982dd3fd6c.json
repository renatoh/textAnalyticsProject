Otherwise, you see, someone would have to sort her out. \u00b7 (Yes, we know we've done the novel campaign merchandise story already. Amazingly, though, we missed the hoodie connection. And the gag about this proving that she's \"part of a gang that wants to terrorise people\". So we're not perfect, OK?) \u00b7 Creative British names for portable toilet companies continue, meanwhile, to flood in. \"Near Malmesbury, and handy for Badminton, Charles's polo field etc,\" writes one alert reader, \"we have The Royal Flush Luxury Loo Hire.\" In Jersey, there's a firm called Rebecca Loos. We have a confirmed sighting of a John's Johns, and of a vulgar Devon outfit whose name features the words drain, stop and cock, although not in that order. Enough! \u00b7 And while we're on, one of our all-too-rare voyages into the perilous waters of bad taste, rest assured that we will not be asking, even though they're all now safely back home, exactly who, with 14 men and one woman out there, was reading the map. \u00b7 These local elections are going to be fun, though! We already have one historic first (as far, at least, as we and Tory Cllr John Fuller are aware): in Thurlton ward of South Norfolk district council, a promising Lib Dem candidate has managed to propose her Green party opponent. Bravo! \u00b7 Also, David Van Day's campaign for election as a Conservative councillor in East Brighton (see past Diaries) seems to be coming along every bit as well as we expected. \"I was actualy born in East Brighton,\" enthuses the bouffant-haired Bucks Fizz, Dollar and Guys'n'Dolls star in his spellbinding campaign flyer, \"and I can bring my many experiences to the aid of some of our most controversial topics. I want a healthy national health ... and I oppose the misguided rules of refuge collection imposed on us by this labour council.\" And the Conservatives being, we hear, the party of literacy, it would be churlish of us not to wish him well. \u00b7 Our coveted Pants Public Pronouncement of the Month Award goes to East Midlands Airport and its neatly-named freesheet, The Flyer. \"We would like,\" it says, \"to hear your ideas of how the airport could become carbon neutral. So please get in touch.\" \u00b7 And so to France, where according to the Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9, presidential favourite Nicolas Sarkozy is on a roll. \"The management here should be fired,\" Sarko observed kindly, after waiting 15 mins to be made up at state broadcaster France 3. \"I can't do it now. But it won't do them any harm to wait. Won't be long.\" That's the ticket! \u00b7 The PM's e-petitions team, we hear, has sensibly rejected a perfectly scurrilous effort urging him to please \"avoid conferring any honour upon us in his Resignation Honours List\" on the grounds that \"recent events have undermined faith in the honours system, and our appearance in a Resignation Honours List personally compiled by the prime minister would be a source of embarrassment. It might also attract the attention of the police and tax authorities.\" What could be further from the truth? \u00b7 Finally, the city health department of Bakerfield, California, has unveiled its new mascot: Sammy the Squirrel.
