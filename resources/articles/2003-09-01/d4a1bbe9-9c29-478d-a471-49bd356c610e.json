Israeli television's Channel Two quoted the war cabinet decision as saying: \"Arafat is an obstacle to peace and Israel will act to remove this obstacle.\" The station said this constituted a decision in principle to oust the Palestinian leader, and that the army had been asked to come up with proposals to remove Mr Arafat. Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz reported that the prime minister, Ariel Sharon, had not made his opinion on the matter public. He could override his cabinet and oppose the expulsion, the paper said. Israeli government officials and cabinet ministers declined immediate comment. The reported decision was an apparent effort to balance growing public and political pressure for a dramatic move with a desire to avoid a confrontation with the US, which opposes expulsion. It also gives the incoming Palestinian prime minister, Ahmed Qureia, some time to take steps to cool the violence that has swept the region in recent weeks. A senior Palestinian security official condemned the decision, saying such a move would destabilise the Middle East. \"Harming Arafat or expelling him will destabilise the region and will only bring disaster to the Israeli people,\" the official said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
