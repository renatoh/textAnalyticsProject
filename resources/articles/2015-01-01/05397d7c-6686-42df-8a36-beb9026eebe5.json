Romney, who ran unsuccessful bids for the presidency in 2008 and 2012, recently played down speculation that he might enter the race for the Republican nomination. Yet at a meeting with around a dozen prospective donors in Manhattan, the former Massachusetts governor signalled that he still wanted to be president and was considering whether to launch another campaign. Romney\u2019s comments to donors \u2013 remarks he would almost certainly have expected would be leaked to the press \u2013 were first reported by the Wall Street Journal and later confirmed by other outlets. A Romney spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Spencer Zwick, Romney\u2019s former national finance co-chairman, who was at the New York meeting, confirmed to the Washington Post that Romney is considering a 2016 run. \u201cI believe Mitt Romney is too much of a patriot to sit on the sidelines and concede the presidency to Hillary Clinton or Elizabeth Warren when he knows that he can fix the country,\u201d Zwick said. \u201cHe traveled the country in 2014, met with voters, met with citizens, and I think at the end of the day he believes he could actually make a difference.\u201d Clinton, the former secretary of state and first lady, is the presumptive Democratic nominee, with polls showing she is highly likely to win her party\u2019s support if she runs. Warren, the Massachusetts senator beloved by left-wingers, is not expected to stand. According to the Washington rumour-mill, Romney has not been impressed by potential Republican contenders. However, Zwick added: \u201cHe won\u2019t make a decision to run for president based on who else is in the race. He will make a decision based on his own desire and his own abilities. He has to decide on his own.\u201d A Romney candidacy would be likely to upset an already crowded field of probable GOP candidates that includes former Florida\u2019s former governor Jeb Bush and current senator Marco Rubio, New Jersey governor Chris Christie and Kentucky senator Rand Paul. Bush was the first to formally show his hand, when he announced last month he had \u201cdecided to actively explore\u201d a run for the White House, which was previously occupied by both his brother and father, George W Bush and George HW Bush. Signalling his intent early was a shrewd move, enabling Bush to begin cementing support from big-money donors essential for any presidential run. Bush and Romney are both considered pro-business, moderate Republicans who would compete for financial backers who favour the GOP establishment. Christie, if he runs, will be chasing a similar category of donor. Romney failed to win the Republican presidential nomination in 2008. In 2012 he won the backing of the GOP but was defeated by the incumbent Democratic president, Barack Obama. A Mormon who made millions in private equity, he has been popular among the Republican rank-and-file since his 2012 defeat. He had been rumoured to be taking counsel from close friends about a third candidacy, while publicly batting away most suggestions that he might once again have his eye on the White House. Romney has repeatedly insisted he has no interest in running again for president, stretching back to the aftermath of his failed 2012 bid. Weeks after he was roundly defeated by Obama, Romney was asked by the New York Times if he would run a third campaign. He replied: \u201cOh, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no.\u201d He has repeated variations of that message over the last two years, although in August he spurred speculation he may reverse course, telling a radio talk show \u201ccircumstances can change\u201d. Yet just two months ago, Romney, whose father, George, also tried to run for president, appeared to be once again taking an unequivocal stance. \u201cI\u2019m not running, I\u2019m not planning on running and I\u2019ve got nothing new on that story,\u201d he told Fox News. Romney\u2019s wife, Ann, has long been said to be opposed to her husband attempting a third bid. However, Romney has told supporters he has felt vindicated by developments at home and abroad since the 2012 presidential election. The Republican\u2019s insistence he would have made a better steward of the economy than Obama has been undermined in recent months by a major uptick in economic growth and employment. But Romney, who was widely mocked by Democrats for identifying identifying Russia as \u201cour No1 geopolitical foe\u201d in 2012, can at least claim some foresight on international affairs. Pollsters have been unsure whether to include Romney among lists of likely presidential candidates. When his name is among the options offered to Republican voters, Romney consistently leads the pack \u2013 although that frontrunner status is partly explained his broad name recognition. Other Republicans believed to be considering a presidential run include the Wisconsin governor Scott Walker and the Texas senator and Tea Party favourite Ted Cruz."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
