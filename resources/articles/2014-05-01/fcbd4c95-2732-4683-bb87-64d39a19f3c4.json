A disastrous front nine run on Friday, during which McIlroy dropped six shots in five holes, looked like condemning the Northern Irishman to a fourth missed Sawgrass cut in five visits. Last year, he finished in a tie for eighth in hinting that perhaps a corner had been turned. McIlroy had started day two at two under par \u2013 he had been three shots better off after 11 holes of round one \u2013 and with aspirations of challenging the leaders. Instead, he reached the turn in 42 strokes and sat at plus four. There was a wonderful recovery from there on, with McIlroy playing the back nine in 10 shots fewer than the front. That was to his credit; in years gone by, he would not have displayed the stomach for such a battle. McIlroy holed out from 12ft on the 18th to secure his place in the weekend field by a stroke. \"I'm really proud of myself that I was able to do that,\" McIlroy said. \"It's not the position I want to be in, battling back to make the cut, but at least I'm in for the weekend. At least there's good golf in there somewhere, and hopefully I can continue that into the weekend, what I showed on the back nine there today.\" Phil Mickelson had no such success, with the Open champion missing the cut by one. At the summit of proceedings, Martin Kaymer added a 69 to his course record-equalling 63 to lead at 12 under par. Jordan Spieth later emerged as Kaymer's strongest challenger. The 20-year-old Spieth, who tied for second at the Masters, moved to within a stroke of of the leader with a blemish-free second round of 66. The talent of Kaymer, a former world No1 and major champion, has never been in question but too often in recent times his mindset has let him down. Now, there are clear signs of a recovery which could be firmly endorsed by the German's first PGA Tour win since 2011. \"The goal is not really to become No1 in the world again,\" Kaymer explained. \"That is three, four, five steps more than you should go. I take it step by step. \"A lot of people think it's a good feeling to be No1 in the world and it does make you very proud. It's nice to be up there but it comes with a lot of pressure and a lot of expectation from others and subconsciously from yourself. \"Yesterday was just a very special day for me. But anything around par today, even level par, it's a good score. If people want to talk negative about it, I shot then six shots worse than round one but you can always go in the negative. I see very positive things that I backed up that nine under with another decent round.\" Lee Westwood signed for 71 and a six under aggregate. Justin Rose and Sergio Garcia are on the same score. \"I'm pleased with my position,\" Westwood said. \"Here at the weekend the golf course generally gets firmer; whether they'll allow it to do that, I don't know, but it generally toughens up. I hit a lot of good shots out there. I don't really think I got rewarded for them. I played a lot better than 71, so am pleased with the way I played again.\" Off-course news provided a Sawgrass ripple on Friday, after it emerged that Adam Scott had secretly married his long-time girlfriend Marie Kojzar the week after the Masters. \"We just decided to get on with it, we've known each other long enough, let's go and jump right in the deep end,\" said Scott. It was just our family and a few friends and obviously there are a lot of people we would have liked to have had there who weren't but we decided to have a very low key affair. \"It was more about not building it up into something too big that may have gotten out of hand but it was a fun event for everyone who was there and hopefully we will have fun celebrating with other friends when we catch up with them.\" One of sport's most eligible bachelors is suddenly off the market."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
