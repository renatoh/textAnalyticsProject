As Labor braces itself for the release of the tightly held campaign review on Thursday, Bowen, the former shadow treasurer and now health spokesman, will make his first substantial public intervention since the May election loss, delivering his rationale for why Labor lost at the inaugural Keating lecture in western Sydney. The official campaign post-mortem, spearheaded by Jay Weatherill and Craig Emerson, meanwhile, will outline the contribution of leadership, campaign strategy and policy to the defeat in May. The report handed to Labor\u2019s national executive is expected to highlight Bill Shorten\u2019s unpopularity, look at the impact of Clive Palmer\u2019s unprecedented advertising spend, as well as highlight problems with the campaign and the detailed policy platform. As Labor absorbs the official post-mortem, Bowen will declare on Thursday evening that Labor must not \u201cshrink into a ball\u201d as a consequence of the election defeat. According to a copy of his speech, circulated ahead of Thursday night\u2019s lecture, Bowen will argue the principal reason for the defeat was a failure to connect with Labor\u2019s traditional constituency, or link the party\u2019s progressive program with Labor\u2019s long-term mission to improve the lot of working people. Bowen will point out that low-income voters supported Donald Trump and the Brexit vote, and the Tories in the UK in 2017 lifted their share of the working class vote from 32% to 44% \u201cbecause people of lower socioeconomic status have lost faith with progressive politics to deliver for them, to deal with their real and burning grievances about growing inequality, risky job security and underemployment\u201d. With populism on the march, rather than presenting as bloodless technocrats, Bowen will say Labor needs to be indignant on behalf of working people, \u201cto be angry on behalf of the people we represent\u201d and to validate their anger about the disadvantages they face \u2013 be it unemployment, or poverty, or lower life expectancy, or chronic illness. He will argue if Labor can\u2019t convince voters it can boost economic growth, the next election is already lost, and he points out that the controversial revenue measures he proposed as shadow treasurer were, in part, \u201cto pay for new spending\u201d. While he was proud of big spending measures, like the $2.3bn pensioner dental plan, Bowen suggests more fiscal discipline will be needed in the coming term of parliament. Bowen says Labor needs to forge a new compact with voters centred around economic reform with a social dividend, as Keating and Hawke did in the 1980s and 1990s. At the centre will be tackling contemporary challenges like climate change or the impact of technology, while using the power of government \u201cto invest in every Australian to help them navigate this changing world\u201d. Bowen will suggest with climate change, rather than using terminology like a \u201cjust transition\u201d for coal workers, Labor explore the Green New Deal, pursued by some Democrats in the United States, which is a stimulus package that aims to address both climate change and economic inequality \u2013 an idea that has been floated post-election by fellow rightwinger Tony Burke. Rather than redistribution, which was implicit in a number of policies Bowen presided over as shadow treasurer, he suggests Labor consider pre-distribution, which is an approach of direct intervention in the labour market to reduce income inequality, rather than redistribution, where wealth is transferred from people who have it to people who don\u2019t. Like fellow rightwinger Claire O\u2019Neil, Bowen will argue that Labor cannot avoid identity politics, because Scott Morrison has \u201cmade an art form of framing proposals and attacks through a cultural prism\u201d. He says Morrison peeled blue-collar votes from Labor very effectively in May by playing identity politics \u201cin a hardball fashion\u201d. Bowen argues people actually impacted by Labor\u2019s proposed revenue measures, higher income earners, actually swung to the ALP in May but working class voters bled to protest candidates or the Coalition because voters thought Labor didn\u2019t care about their economic security. Bowen will say Labor in recent times has framed its policy offering through an economic prism, but the Coalition is playing on different turf. He argues the Liberals under Morrison \u201cexcel\u201d in appealing to the values of identity, and the pitch is resonant. If Labor is to peel back blue-collar votes from Morrison in the coming term, it needs to \u201ccounter this flagrant identity politics \u2026 with a full-throated exposition of our values\u201d \u2013 being clear with hardworking traditional Labor supporters that \u201cwe are for them, we were formed to improve their lives, and we haven\u2019t forgotten our mission\u201d. Labor needs to \u201cexplain clearly and passionately that cutting off trade or less immigration\u201d isn\u2019t an answer to the anxiety felt by blue-collar workers in Australia and outline an alternative policy proposition. Bowen says there are dangers for Labor in being drawn into the progressive activist prism that is amplified by social media, noting \u201cwell intentioned hashtag campaigns that make social media activists feel good about their morality can make hard working Australians feel alienated and exposed\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
