English cricket achieved standout success at Sunday night\u2019s ceremony in Aberdeen, taking the team of the year as well as Stokes\u2019s individual award, and winning the moment of the year for the winning run-out against New Zealand in the World Cup final. The challenge now is to capitalise on it. \u201cThat moment at Lords when we won the World Cup was a childhood dream,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cTalking about the years before that you look at it and sport has an amazing way of picking you back up. You\u2019ve got so many people around you who are able to help you \u2013 family, teammates, everybody involved in cricket is a part of that. \u201cWhen you\u2019re out there as a batsman, I just try to envisage myself as a boy in a bubble. Anything outside of that, I\u2019ll try not to let it in. I just look at what I\u2019ve got to do with the bat in hand.\u201d Stokes was dropped by England in 2017 after being involved in a brawl outside a Bristol nightclub that led him to stand trial on charges of affray. He was recalled for the 2018 winter tour of New Zealand and was found not guilty at Bristol crown court the following summer. \u201cWhen you\u2019re not in [the team] that gets taken away from you,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cIf [your teammates] are taking time out of their days to keep in contact and see how you are, that\u2019s when you really know you\u2019re part of something quite special. That wasn\u2019t just for the first days and weeks that was completely until I got back in the team. Even though I wasn\u2019t there I was made to feel like I was.\u201d For Eoin Morgan there was no surprise Stokes won the award after his performance not only in the World Cup but during the unforgettable third Ashes Test at Headingley. The collective awards, however, were a pleasant surprise for the one-day captain. \u201cThere was probably an expectation between us [of Ben] winning the big award,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cBut to scoop the other two on top of it in what was a big year for sport \u2026 It\u2019s fantastic to see that cricket is at the forefront of everybody\u2019s mind. It was incredible to be part of, we travelled up and down the country witnessing it first hand, just the incredible caring nature and the feelgood factor around the sport. For me that means a huge amount.\u201d Asked how cricket can build on this success, Morgan said: \u201cI think you try to take advantage of the platform that the success has brought. Using the opportunities to grow the game and get it to the most important people, which is young kids up and down the country. We want to be in schools getting a bat and ball in their hand and I think The Hundred couldn\u2019t come at a better time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
