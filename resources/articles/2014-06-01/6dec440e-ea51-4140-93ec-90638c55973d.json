It was a bad day for Europe. And an even worse day for Britain in Europe. Few of the leaders chewing over their options at lunch emerged with much credit from the backstabbing saga that elevated Jean-Claude Juncker, an EU has-been, to the most powerful post in Brussels. But the Luxembourger owes a debt of gratitude to the prime minister. Cameron's strident campaign turned the issue into a zero-sum game \u2013 back me or support Juncker. For Angela Merkel and 25 others, it was a no-brainer. Cameron knew he could not win, so he chose to up the ante. There would be no deals. Juncker was non-negotiable. But there is little point in attending EU summits except to negotiate. The biggest negotiation of Cameron's prime ministership lies ahead \u2013 the mission to reset the UK's terms of engagement with the EU in a way that enables him to win 2017's mooted in-out referendum and keep Britain in Europe. That challenge was always going to be a tough one. It has just got much tougher. The auguries are not encouraging. Cameron's performance smacked of petulance. He was rattled when the media pack taunted him with unflattering comparisons with Margaret Thatcher. She went to Fontainebleau, yelled no, no, no, and got her money back. Cameron went to Brussels, said no, and was ignored. If Cameron has a European policy, it needs to be rethought as a matter of urgency. He appears less a master of Britain's destiny in Europe than the hostage of forces he has helped to unleash, trapped between isolation in the EU and his own Europe quitters at home. To tell the leaders of Germany, France and Italy that they are all wrong and that he is uniquely right seems a singularly unproductive way of conducting the argument. Yet this is what Cameron did. Europe was taking the wrong decision, the wrong approach, going in the wrong direction, making the wrong choice. Even if occasionally right, this is hard to take. Is it better to be right forfeiting the goodwill of all your partners? Or is it sometimes more sensible to be wrong and in credit with your allies? It depends on the fight. Hitler, of course. But Jean-Claude Juncker? Chancellor Merkel won last month's European election comfortably in Germany. Italy's Matteo Renzi was the biggest winner of all. Cameron led the Tories to a historic defeat, a third place, with the Ukip union jacks flying rampant. So what makes Cameron so right and the others so wrong? He delivered a lecture on the imperative for reform of the EU, the argument pitched in his usual martial metaphors of battles and wars, fights and campaigns, us against them, St George and the European dragon, as if he has a unique insight into the need for change. This is nonsense. Merkel has been banging on about reform for years. Renzi is a reformist. Ditto the Scandinavians and the Dutch. The east Europeans could teach the west Europeans a thing or six about reform. Mass youth unemployment, anaemic growth, an ageing and shrinking population, unsustainable welfare systems, inability to develop coherent immigration policies, austerity everywhere, anti-system, anti-Europe radicals on the far right and the hard left hammering on the doors. Everyone knows the EU has to change or wither. Reform is the most overused word in the EU. The trouble is that by reform they all mean different things. For Cameron, it means a new deal with Brussels that entrenches UK exceptionalism while remaining in the club. For Merkel, it means taking an axe to Italy's and France's economic rigidity. For Renzi, it means loosening Berlin's fiscal straitjacket to give the Italian economy a chance to grow. It is a truism that Conservative prime ministers invariably come to grief over Europe, undermined, demoralised and ultimately destroyed by the long civil war inside the Tory party. It is also the case that Conservative prime ministers have achieved great things in and for Europe, and for Britain. Edward Heath took Britain in. Margaret Thatcher bulldozed through Europe's single market. London championed the enlargement from 15 to 28 countries, prevailing over fainthearts in what has been the EU's most successful foreign policy ever. John Major secured the deals at Maastricht that kept the UK out of the euro. Cameron is drifting into a worse place than his predecessors for the simple reason that he has left the exit door slightly ajar by committing to a referendum. For his own Europe rejectionists, for the Farage insurgency, for the Daily Mail, for the Murdoch papers, the way out of Europe beckons, courtesy of the gift of the prime minister. They will not take their eyes off that door. Cameron insists he wants to close it by securing a better deal, though he opened it in the first place. To succeed, the ally he needs most of all is Merkel. The German leader is quietly and stealthily ruthless. She will do what is good for her. There is no doubt that Britain in Europe is good for her. The so-called Brexit would expose her to an imbalanced contest with the Club Med \u2013 France, Italy and Spain, the three biggest economies in the eurozone after Germany. Merkel was not keen on Juncker either, but unlike Cameron, she emerges unscathed from a bad situation. Merkel is no great strategist, but a much cleverer tactician than the prime minister. Cameron demanded Juncker's head on a platter. And failed. Merkel will constrain and undermine Juncker by embracing him. As Cameron ranted in Brussels, Merkel went chillingly clinical. There was an exquisitely understated put-down. The British, she said after the 26-2 vote against Cameron in favour of Juncker, should be \"a bit more sober\" in their Europe policy. Calm down, Cameron. The question is not so much whether she wants to keep the UK in the EU as what she will give to make it possible and whether that will be enough to bolster Cameron's sales pitch to Britain's voters. The prime minister cuts a weakened, diminished, lonelier figure this weekend \u2013 a prime minister of the Conservative and Unionist party who risks overseeing the break-up of the United Kingdom and Britain's departure from the European Union. That's a baleful legacy to contemplate. His job just got harder, the stakes just got higher, Cameron said on Friday afternoon. In this, too, he was right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
