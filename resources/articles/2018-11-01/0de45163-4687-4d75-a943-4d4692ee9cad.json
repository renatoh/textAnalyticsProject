A growing number of businesses in New York and cities around the country have adopted cashless policies, refusing to accept paper currency and requiring customers to pay with debit or credit cards. The trend has spread from hipster coffee shops to popular burrito and salad chains, with business owners saying it\u2019s quicker and easier to dispense with cash. But city councilman Ritchie Torres, who introduced the legislation to prohibit the practice, said it freezes out people who don\u2019t have access to bank accounts and credit cards, who are more likely to be low-income and people of color. The same concerns have prompted proposed bans in Philadelphia and Washington DC. Torres called the proposals a \u201cnew frontier\u201d of anti-discrimination law, needed to prevent a \u201cgentrification of the marketplace\u201d by businesses unwilling to accept cash. \u201cA cashless business model has an exclusionary effect on the impoverished, the homeless, the underbanked, the undocumented,\u201d he told the Guardian. Studies have found that nearly 12% of New Yorkers do not have bank accounts. Poor people may have trouble maintaining an account because they require a minimum balance or charge fees, while credit cards require a good credit score. Unauthorized immigrants cannot open an account at many banks if they lack proper ID. \u201cIf you live in a bubble of wealthy white privilege, you have reason to believe that everyone has a card. But there\u2019s more to New York City,\u201d Torres said. But Andrew Rigie, head of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, said there should be a \u201cfair balance\u201d that does not unduly burden businesses. \u201cThere are operational and worker safety benefits to running a cashless restaurant, however, they should not result in discriminating against people who don\u2019t have credit cards,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
