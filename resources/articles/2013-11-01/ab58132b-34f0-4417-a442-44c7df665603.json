Doubtless a wise investment, although in point of fact it has not seen much use yet. Not only has the weather in the north of England been unexpectedly clement, Manchester City's Spanish centre-forward has been such a success in his first Premier League season he has found little time for exploring his new surroundings. \"I like going for walks, going around the city with my family, but the truth is that there have been such a lot of games recently I haven't done much more than stay at home and rest,\" Negredo explains. \"There hasn't been too much time to do a lot of wandering around but I have signed for four years, so I have a while yet to find out about Manchester.\" The striker, who scored a hat-trick against CSKA Moscow in City's last Champions League outing, has certainly found the football in England to his liking. \"Most of what I had heard about the Premier League turns out to be true,\" he says. \"You look at it from outside and think: \"OK, I've got my expectations\" but then you actually come here and see what it means to people and to be playing in it and you suddenly realise: 'Wow, my expectations need to go up here!' That is what I am trying to do and I am enjoying it.\" People said as soon as Negredo arrived that his direct, muscular style would be suited to English football. In fact, it turns out he even heard that said of him in Spain. \"At Sevilla we had a similar kind of style. We had Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes and Jes\u00fas Navas on the wings and crossing and they needed a big centre-forward in the middle to knock it. \"At Sevilla I was always there in the middle, trying to make sure that when the ball came in, I knew what to do with it. That's why it is great to have Jes\u00fas here with me now. We have been together for four years now, so we understand how each other plays. I don't even have to look to see where he is going to put the ball. I just know instinctively whether he is going to cross to the far post, the near post or in the middle and that kind of simplicity makes it very easy for me.\" Negredo scored 31 goals for Sevilla last season and believes if he can match that in England he will have a chance of making the Spanish World Cup squad. In 19 appearances for his country he has managed 10 goals, a more than decent strike rate, but he was nevertheless overlooked for the last World Cup in South Africa. There are good players ahead of him but the 28-year-old has faced competition throughout his career and generally prospered. \"Competition is good,\" he says. \"I like to set myself challenges. I am really happy with the time I am getting on the pitch and hopefully it will carry on like this but I don't have a problem with fighting for my place in the team.\" Ironically, the only time Negredo has found his way blocked by quality team-mates ahead of him was at his first senior club, managed by one M Pellegrini, who quickly sold him. But Real Madrid at the end of the gal\u00e1ctico was something out of the ordinary. \"The problem I had at Real was that I was very young and I was fighting for a place in the squad with a lot of world-class players,\" he says. \"There was Ra\u00fal, Ronaldo, Benzema, Van Nistelrooy and Higua\u00edn, so I didn't really have much of a chance because of the age I was. At least when Pellegrini sold me, he spoke to me and explained his decision. He said to me: 'Listen, I want you to go to a club where you can keep growing by doing well.' He helped me look at my options, there were no hard feelings. If anything, I am grateful to him \u2013 and not just because he has brought me to Manchester. \"I know he has confidence in me because he also wanted me when he was in charge at Villarreal and M\u00e1laga but he was honest with me, very up front about what he felt I should do, and that's all you can ask from a manager.\" Negredo is well on his way to cult hero status at the Etihad, helped by a nickname \u2013 The Beast \u2013 that has already been adapted into the old Feed the Goat song from Shaun Goater's time at the club. \"I've never met Shaun Goater but I am aware that he was really well loved here and a few team-mates have explained the song,\" he says. \"I like it a lot but I have liked it here right from the first day. When you go out in the streets people say hello to you, wish you good morning, it's a really great feeling. People paint England a bit black but you know it is not too bad at all. It is one of the best decisions I have made on a personal level and a football level.\" So would Negredo recommend a move to England to, say, Lionel Messi, who perhaps needs to get out of his one-club comfort zone in Barcelona? \"I suppose so, it could happen,\" he says. \"He is a player who can play really well in any league at all and maybe in a few years' time he will get bored with La Liga and want a change.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
