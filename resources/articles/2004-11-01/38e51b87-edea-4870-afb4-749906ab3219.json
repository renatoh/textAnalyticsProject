Cyprus - just four-and-a-half hours away - is probably best known as a package holiday destination, but if you're heading to the island in winter don't bother with sun tan cream. Temperatures are a pleasant 15 degrees or so - not hot enough for the sunlounger but just right for luxury indoor heated pools, saunas and treatments. The island has become something of a sanctuary for spa lovers, with several hotels upgrading their facilities in recent years, and numbers will be boosted further in March with the opening of The Retreat Spa at the Intercontinental Aphrodite Hills Resort Hotel. All prices are valid for January 2005, based on flights from the London area and two people sharing a room. Le Meridien Limassol lemeridien-cyprus.com This 10-year-old hotel is home to Cyprus's oldest, biggest and most comprehensive spa. It can feel a tad old-fashioned: the staff wear traditional dark suits and ties whatever the sea son, and the toiletries in the rooms smell unnervingly like Glade. Once I made it past all the conference delegates in the hotel lobby, the first thing that caught my eye in the spa was a fish tank with huge fish curling around inside. One guest had written in the visitors' book: 'Please note there are too many fish, by at least three times, for the size of your aquarium.' Once into the main area you realise this spa is the real deal. The hotel's slogan - 'beyond the gate ... luxury and pleasure' - does set itself up to be knocked, though: without reading that, I might not have noticed that the pink bathrobes and towels were a bit threadbare. But there are 32 treatment rooms, many with natural daylight and views of the sea, and a thalassotherapy centre with three indoor pools (four outdoor ones in summer) which you use in sequence. The first looks like an oil slick, and after a 10-minute wallow gives your skin a slight stinging sensation. The second pool, heated to 33C, has a high saline content allowing you to float effortlessly. You then pass into a big 29C seawater pool with jets, and finish off in a hamam which opens up your pores and prepares your body to receive any other treatments. The list is extensive. I was strangely drawn to the 70-minute Elemis Hawaiian Wave Four Hand Massage. Gyrating Hawaiians in grass skirts with guitars it is not ... but it's pretty good all the same. The therapist gives you an eyemask to wear and then douses you with frangipani oil to hydrate the skin. She then uses brushes in sweeping motions up and down your body. A mystery second pair of hands then appears, sweeping the skin behind the first. Much of the massage is synchronised, so while one pair of hands is massaging your face and skull, the other kneads your feet and ankles. The treatments Around 100, from the Elemis Fennel Cleansing Cellulite and Colon Therapy to Thai massage. What the brochure doesn't tell you Conference delegates in name badges peer at you sitting in the rest room in your dressing gown as they sip coffee on an adjacent balcony. The damage Argo Holidays (0870 066 7070; argo-holidays.com) has seven-night B&amp;B breaks including flights and transfers for \u00a3520pp. Massage from \u00a342 for 55 minutes; day package including thalassotherapy, hamam, body scrub, facial, Indian head massage and lunch, \u00a3194; a 75-minute session in the thalassotherapy pools, \u00a354; the Elemis Hawaiian Wave Four Hand Massage, \u00a3146. The Anassa Polis thanoshotels.com The Anassa is set in a stunning, remote northwestern spot of the island. Even if you didn't go near the spa, just sitting on your balcony listening to the sound of the ocean and breathing the air would make you feel relaxed. Rooms are cool with tiled floors and decor in whites and blues. The spa, built under the hotel chapel, has more of a built-in exercise element (at the Meridien, yoga and exercise classes are available in another area of the hotel). There's a large heated indoor pool, outside whirlpool, steam rooms, his and hers saunas and a candle-lit relaxation room for yoga and meditation, as well as a few small treatment rooms. Hatha and kundalini yoga run six days a week. My first appointment was for an aromatherapy luxury foot and nail treatment. My feet and hands were lathered in exfoliating cream and covered in luscious-smelling mandarin oil. Paraffin wax-soaked tissues were wrapped on mummy-style, then removed for more massaging - a great treatment. It was just a shame that the therapist didn't explain anything about the treatment or its benefits. I had more luck with an Indian head massage, courtesy of Morgan from Mauritius. He forewarned me of what he would do (always helpful from a stranger about to paw your body): lots of gentle hair-pulling, ear-folding, neck-flicking and kneading knots in my shoulders. He said my 'meridian lines were blocked' and offered distance-reiki healing on my neck - if I left my name, address and age at reception ... At the Anassa the towels are thick and the food near-perfect (my lunch of red snapper with grilled fennel was washed down with Welsh Ty Nant mineral water). It would be a won derful place for recuperation in solitude, although the prices are high. The treatments A carefully selected variety, from head massages and reiki to Espa detox wraps and salt scrubs. What the brochure doesn't tell you During my winter stay the hotel had a ghost-town air about it - there were too few people knocking around in too big a space. The damage Expressions Holidays (020 7433 2615; spaexpressions.co.uk) has seven-night B&amp;B packages for \u00a31,320pp including flights, transfers and a free three-day treatment package if booked before the end of November. A 55-minute body massage is \u00a351; three-day treatment package including salt scrub, thalasso bath, detox massage and hydrotherapy bath, \u00a3296; aromatherapy foot and nail treatment, \u00a343; Indian head massage, \u00a343. Elysium Paphos elysium.com.cy This is a palatial terracotta hotel of grand proportions with marble floors, bellboys, orchestral background music and staff in formal suits and ties. It's all built around a central pool complex with Jacuzzis and lagoon-style pools and bridges. As is often the case in Cyprus, the hotel itself is the holiday: the beach is not much to write home about (in fact the Elysium's was just a desolate corner of rubble when I was there). After the contemporary feel of the Anassa, the Elysium is traditional and classic in style, even though it opened only recently. Rooms are heavily carpeted, wardrobes are dark-wood-panelled, and curtains are like duvets. It is the kind of hotel where they have an aisle of deserted boutiques on the ground floor, and they won't stand for guests buying their Evian at the local supermarket: a little sign above the mini bar informs me that 'only Hotel Mini Bar items are to be stored in the Mini Bar Cabinet of your room'. The ground floor spa is reached through sliding doors. Day beds and candles are grouped around a small Jacuzzi, with treatment rooms leading off the central space. This is a small spa, and you need to book well ahead to get the time slots you want. I tried the Aveda Elemental Facial which involved lots of hot towels and face, neck and shoulder massage, as well as a tangerine hand and arm massage while the mask was setting. For the head massage, warm oil was trickled over me while lots of balancing aromatherapy oils were placed around me on towels. It felt like a spring clean of the top quarter of my body. The treatments Around 30, including facials, body treatments (such as body masks and hydrotherapy baths) and massages plus beauty treatments. What the brochure doesn't tell you The spa is a nice extra during a holiday here but isn't extensive enough to be your main reason to come. The damage Erna Low Body &amp; Soul Holidays (020 7594 0290;bodyandsoulholidays.com) has one-week stays for \u00a3640pp including flights, transfers and breakfast. A one-hour massage is \u00a354; a three-day treatment package including salt and oil scrub, hydrobath, aromatherapy facial, mud envelopment, reflexology, neck and scalp massage, full body massage and skin brightening facial is \u00a3360. Thalassa Paphos thalassa.com.cy Despite the name, this 58-room hotel and spa has no links to thalassotherapy. The hotel, which opened in July, sits on a peninsula surrounded on three sides by the sea, so all balconies have sea views. If you go for a room on the west side you'll get the sunsets, too. The unique selling point here is that each room comes with its own mobilephone-equipped personal butler, on call 24 hours a day. Want someone to unpack for you, run a bath, play tennis with you, or take you shopping? Then just ask Jeeves. The spa has five treatment rooms and a dispensary of bath salts, essential oils and herbs where you can have any combination of smelly lotions and potions mixed up for you. There's also a yoga/pilates room and a gym. One of the best things about the spa is that you are not confined to the hotel for treatments. So if you fancy a massage on the beach or in the forest the hotel can arrange it for you. The treatments The spa uses Sodashi 100 per cent natural products (best known and used in the Far East and Australia). It has probably the most imaginative selection of treatments on the island, from Trhana Body Ritual, where yoghurt and fresh wild herbs are smeared all over you, to Kofo Therapia Me Keri, a candlewax treatment to draw wax out of the ear. What the brochure doesn't tell you Each 'residence' is usually two or three adjoining rooms. The hotel was originally designed as a three-star joint with standard size rooms, but when the building was upgraded to five-star they couldn't get planning permission to knock the rooms into larger ones. The damage Elegant Resorts (01244 897515; elegantresorts.co.uk) has seven nights' B&amp;B in a 'superior' double room, including transfers and flights for \u00a31,755pp. An aromatherapy massage is \u00a354; a one-day purification package including hydrotherapy bath, body mask, reflexology, lymphatic awakening facial and sauna is \u00a3206. Columbia Beach Resort columbia-hotels.com Choosing a spa hotel from the brochures can be tricky because they all look rather similar - lots of soft lit-photos with close-ups of pools and occasional tables. So it was a pleasant surprise to arrive at Columbia Beach Resort and feel I'd finally found what I'd been looking for. Something special. The drive to this two-year-old, 94-suite hotel, is through windy roads and a little Cypriot village. The secluded resort (not to be confused with the three-star Columbia Beach Hotel down the road) is a low-rise property in the style of a traditional village - all terracotta tiled roofs and coarse brickwork, with a mountainous backdrop. The hotel is built around an extensive pool, but not because the beach is no good - there's a beautiful long stretch of clean sand great for those morning walks. The spa rooms lead off a circular teak wood room, and feature long windows with natural daylight flooding in from lush gardens. There is a wonderfully warm indoor pool which extends to the outdoors - even in mid-winter, the sun loungers inside were full of Brits reading Hello! magazine, or snoozing between treatments. The list on offer here may not be very long, but it is interesting, and prices are more reasonable than some competitors. I chose a metamorphosis massage from a therapist called Photoula. She spent a lot of time tickling my toes and feet with oil and making my ears and cheek bones tingle. When I asked what the treatment would do she said mysteriously, 'It is something emotional. You tell me what you feel afterwards.' All I can say is, I highly recommend it. The treatments Around 25 including Chinese Taoist body massage, crystal colour therapy, ayurvedic massage and beauty treatments. What the brochure doesn't tell you Book treatments early, ideally before you arrive. All the hotel guests seem to be vying for treatments - even those who haven't come here for the spa - because they've heard they are so good. The damage Cyprus specialist Sunvil (020 8568 4499; sunvil.co.uk/cyprus) is offering seven nights from \u00a3737pp including flights, breakfast and car hire. A one-hour aromatherapy massage is \u00a336; one hour of the metamorphic technique is \u00a342; half an hour of reiki therapy is \u00a342. How to get there Cyprus Airways (020 83591333; cyprusairways.com) flies from Heathrow, Stansted, Manchester and Birmingham to Larnaca and Paphos from \u00a3120 return (not including tax).
