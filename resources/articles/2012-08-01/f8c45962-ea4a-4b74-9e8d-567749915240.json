A \u00a39.5m offer for Jarvis was rejected by Wolves on Thursday, the second time in a week West Ham have seen their attempts to agree a deal for the 26-year-old \u2013 who has handed in a transfer request at Molineux \u2013 fail, with the Londoners having offered \u00a39m for him last Friday. \"Stuck is the answer,\" said Allardyce, when asked about a deal for Jarvis. \"I don't know how that will pan out now, we'll just have to wait and see. It's on the back-burner for now and what we've got to try and do is agree something with Wolverhampton Wanderers. How and when that happens, I don't know.\" The impasse over signing Jarvis represents the latest setback in the transfer market for Allardyce, who claims to have seen 10 deals for new recruits fail to materialise this summer, the most notable of which being a loan-first move for Andy Carroll. \"We never agreed with Liverpool any deal to be able to speak to Andy Carroll to see if he would join us,\" said the West Ham manager. \"Whatever deal we put forward to Liverpool wasn't agreed by Liverpool, but what is for sure is that he would have been a massive signing for us. \"Unlike most promoted clubs we released a lot of players [during the summer] because we needed to increase the talent of the squad and reduce the [average] age so we released seven to eight players, which is unusual for a promoted side. So you've got to replace those seven to eight players with another seven to eight players and we're not there yet.\" Allardyce has brought eight players into the club, however, following their promotion from the Championship, including Jussi Jaaskelainen from Bolton, James Collins from Aston Villa and the France midfielder Alou Diarra from Marseille. \"Everybody we've signed will have a big part to play in terms of how successful we are this season,\" Allardyce said. \"But however good I think we are I won't really know until we start playing Premier League games. My dreams are to try and get the team to finish in a position where there is little or no pressure on them from a relegation point of view. As near to a top-10 finish as we can.\" West Ham's campaign begins with a visit from Aston Villa on Saturday and Allardyce has confirmed that none of the players he has signed from abroad will start against Paul Lambert's side. \"Winning the first game is as important as winning the last one,\" he said. \"If you can win the first one it gets everyone off to a nice pleasant start, three points in the bag, and builds the confidence of everyone at the club and reduces the anxieties they may have about 'can we reproduce in the Premier League because the last time we were there we were relegated'.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
