The Northern Irishman will be spared the pursuit of the Players Championship from the last group of the tournament. Spared is the appropriate term: McIlroy has not won on the previous nine occasions he has played in Sunday\u2019s final pairing. Analysis of that has become a rising theme, one that will now be irrelevant regardless of the outcome here. McIlroy and Tommy Fleetwood trail Jon Rahm\u2019s 15 under par by a shot with 18 holes of the PGA Tour\u2019s flagship event to play. McIlroy\u2019s third round of 70 was far from a disaster but he appeared uncomfortable for the first time in this tournament; as demonstrated by his finding of just four fairways in regulation. The 28\u2011year\u2011old duly headed for a range session after completing media duties. \u201cI hit it really good for the first couple days,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I was just maybe getting ahead of it a little bit. I missed a few to the right, so was maybe just getting a little quick from the top. It\u2019s probably something very simple.\u201d McIlroy had dropped shots on his first two third-round holes. The scorecard blemishes ended there. A gloriously faded long iron to the par-three 8th, which left a tap-in birdie, was one of the shots of McIlroy\u2019s year, let alone this competition. There was just a single birdie thereafter. McIlroy had to make do with a par at the par five 16th having found water in two. \u201cI\u2019m in a good position \u2013 not the best position I could be in \u2013 but I thought after the start today that to play the last 16 holes in four under par with no bogeys was a good effort,\u201d McIlroy added. \u201cI just got off to a bit of a slow start. I don\u2019t mind bogeying the 1st, that\u2019s fine. But then the bogey at the 2nd hole was a little disappointing. I showed some character out there, showed some grit. I got a few back, it would have been nice to pick up a couple in the last few holes but I\u2019m still right there going into tomorrow.\u201d Rahm had not particularly featured in analysis of this tournament before day three. A 64, which included a stunning back nine of 30, completely altered that scenario. Pinpoint iron play was key to the Spaniard\u2019s scoring; keeping his occasionally colourful emotions in check will be essential if Rahm is to return what would be the biggest success of his career. \u201cI don\u2019t know what my scoring average has been on Saturday over the last two years but I think I\u2019ve beat it by quite a bit,\u201d said Rahm. \u201cIt was a great day. I didn\u2019t miss many shots out there. The only bogey today I made was at the 6th and it was after a good shot that landed a foot from the hole. So it was one of those days.\u201d Fleetwood made a double bogey at the 1st, which appeared ominous given his Saturday struggles at last weekend\u2019s Arnold Palmer Invitational. This time, the Englishman steadied the ship; Fleetwood played the remaining 17 holes in four under to leave him just a stroke from the lead. Fleetwood\u2019s third-round highlight was a converted birdie putt from 28ft at the 8th before he hit his tee shot at the 17th to 2ft. It is Fleetwood who will have Rahm for company on Sunday. Jason Day\u2019s 68 moved him to 12 under. Mexico\u2019s Abraham Ancer is a shot further back with a sextet at 10 under including the world No 1, Dustin Johnson. Tiger Woods\u2019s 72 left him rather making up the numbers at three under. A straightforward two at the 17th marked a five-shot improvement on Friday. The 14-times major winner will soon turn his attention to the group format of the WGC Match Play in Austin, which will mark Woods\u2019s last appearance before the Masters. \u201cI\u2019m guaranteed to play three rounds in a couple of weeks and so that\u2019s basically like a tournament and we\u2019ll see from there,\u201d Woods explained. \u201cThe whole idea is I\u2019m not going to play as much as I did last year.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
