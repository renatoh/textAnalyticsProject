In the 1940s, she was one of the leading performers working for Monogram, the poorest of Poverty Row studios, appearing in shoestring musicals, thrillers and westerns. Stale and mediocre as many of the movies were, Storm injected them with vitality and charm. She carried these qualities into her television work. She was born Josephine Owaissa Cottle (her middle name a native American word for bluebird) in Texas, the youngest of five children. Her father, a potter, died when she was a year old and her mother became a seamstress to pay the bills. After leaving high school in Houston, where the family had moved, the young Josephine won a radio singing contest called Gateway to Hollywood, which landed her a two-movie contract with RKO and a change of name. The 19-year-old was given smallish roles in Tom Brown's Schooldays (1940) and One Crowded Hour (1941) before leaving for the netherworld of the second feature. Most of her earliest roles were as the gal singing the occasional song while waiting at the ranch for Roy Rogers. Then, for a while, she was cast mainly as a nightclub or radio singer, as in Rhythm Parade (1942) and Campus Rhythm (1943), in the latter of which, catching the mood of the times, she sang Its Taps for the Japs. In Revenge of the Zombies (1943), Storm tried to foil the plot of mad scientist John Carradine, who was trying to help Hitler by developing zombies to do his evil work in the US, and she was a juvenile delinquent who is helped to go straight by Jackie Cooper in Where Are Your Children? (1944). A little more money was spent on Sunbonnet Sue (1945), a turn-of-the-century musical set in the Bowery district of New York, with Storm pleasantly crooning such oldies as By the Light of the Silvery Moon. It was only in the last two years of her film career that she graduated to the bigger studios, appearing in Technicolor as the partner of Audie Murphy in his first western, The Kid From Texas (1950). In Curtain Call at Cactus Creek (1950), as part of an acting troupe out west, run by Donald O'Connor, Storm gave a delightful rendition of Be My Little Baby Bumblebee. Before television claimed her, her last two films, both in 1951, had her as the true love of George Montgomery in The Texas Rangers and of Rod Cameron in Woman of the North Country. By then married to the bit-part actor Terry Belmont (real name Lee Bonnel), the 30-year-old Storm played 21-year-old Margie Albright in the sitcom My Little Margie, in which she spent three years, from 1952 to 1955, saving her widower father from the machinations of various women. This was followed by the even more successful Oh Susanna (later retitled The Gale Storm Show), where she was Susanna Pomeroy, the social director of a luxury liner who, with the help of scatter-brained ZaSu Pitts, sorted out the passengers' romantic problems. Parallel to her TV show, Storm was the queen of the jukeboxes, with several pop hits including Teenage Prayer, Tell Me Why, Why Do Fools Fall In Love?, Memories are Made of This, I Hear You Knockin' and Dark Moon (which reached No 4 on the hit parade). When The Gale Storm Show ended in 1960, after a four-year run, Storm retired from acting. Later, she revealed in her autobiography, I Ain't Down Yet (1981), how she had fought and won a hard battle against alcoholism, with the aid of her husband, detoxification, aversion therapy and a counselling programme, after which she never touched alcohol again. In her later years, Storm, as vivacious as ever, would be seen at celebrations and reunions, at which she was always ready with a song. Twice widowed, she is survived by three sons and a daughter by her first marriage. \u2022 Gale Storm (Josephine Owaissa Cottle), actor and singer, born 5 April 1922; died 27 June 2009"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
