The prime minister, Tony Abbott, announced the decision hours after Indonesia proceeded with the firing-squad execution of the Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan and six other people for drug offences. The ambassador, Paul Grigson, will leave Jakarta this week in a form of protest Australia did not adopt after several previous cases of citizens facing the death penalty. The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said the recall was intended \u201cto register our displeasure at the way our citizens have been treated\u201d. She said the government would consult Grigson on the way forward for relations between the two countries in the longer term. Abbott said ministerial contacts between the two countries had been suspended \u201cand they will remain suspended for a period\u201d. \u201cThese executions are both cruel and unnecessary; cruel because both Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran spent some decade in jail before being executed, and unnecessary, because both of these young Australians were fully rehabilitated while in prison,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cAustralia respects the Indonesian system. We respect Indonesia\u2019s sovereignty but we do deplore what\u2019s been done and this cannot be simply business as usual.\u201d Indonesia\u2019s attorney general, HM Prasetyo, said the withdrawal of the ambassador would be only \u201cmomentary\u201d. \u201cThe Netherlands have done the same thing in the past. Brazil has done the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this is just a momentary reaction, and this will be settled within the diplomatic sphere. What we are doing is carrying out the court decision. Every case should have an end.\u201d The Indonesian foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, said it was Australia\u2019s right to withdraw the ambassador. \u201cThe withdrawal of the ambassador, calling the ambassador for consultation, is the right of the sending country, in this case the right of Australia,\u201d Marsudi said on the sidelines of an event at Bidakara Hotel in Jakarta on Wednesday. She stressed the importance of the bilateral relationship. \u201cEvery time we communicate with Australia, we always emphasise the desire of Indonesia to continue the good relationship. For Indonesia, Australia is an important partner, and I think for Australia, Indonesia is an important partner.\u201d Abbott said the Australia-Indonesia relationship was \u201cvery important\u201d but had suffered as a result of the executions and would go through \u201ca dark moment\u201d. He hoped relations could be restored. \u201cWhatever people think of the death penalty, whatever people think of drug crime, the fact is that these two families have suffered an appalling tragedy and I\u2019m sure that every Australian\u2019s thoughts and prayers will be with those families at this time,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a parent, as a family member myself, I feel for these families at what is a very, very difficult time.\u201d Bishop said she had been in contact with the men\u2019s families overnight and they were in \u201ca devastating position\u201d and had been subjected to a \u201cghastly\u201d ordeal. Australia had continued to seek a stay of execution \u201cright up until the last minute\u201d based on concerns that the rehabilitation of the pair had apparently not been taken into account, she said. \u201cOur consular officials will arrange for the bodies to be repatriated to Australia and to ensure that they are treated with appropriate dignity and respect,\u201d Bishop said. When asked whether the Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, had given Australia\u2019s representations due consideration, Abbott said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to personalise it but obviously I do regret that while my representations have been listened to patiently and courteously, they have not been heeded.\u201d Abbott appeared to caution Australians against boycotting Indonesia, saying while people were entitled to be angry they should be \u201cvery careful to ensure that we do not allow our anger to make a bad situation worse\u201d. Australian MPs from all sides of politics expressed their anger at the execution of Chan and Sukumuran, who were the subject of a long campaign for clemency. Many politicians referred to the widely accepted accounts of Chan and Sukumaran\u2019s rehabilitation in prison after they were convicted over the 2005 Bali Nine heroin smuggling plot. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, and the deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, condemned the executions \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d and backed \u201ca strong response from the Australian government\u201d. \u201cOur best hopes have been dashed and our worst fears realised,\u201d Shorten and Plibersek said in a joint statement. \u201cIndonesia has not just robbed two young men of their lives but robbed itself of two examples of the strengths of its justice system.\u201d \u201cA decade ago, these two young men made a dreadful mistake. By all accounts they spent every minute since seeking to mend their ways and to steer others on the road to redemption \u2013 proof the justice system could reform wrongdoers, not just punish wrongdoing. Yet today, they were made to pay for one stupid decision of 10 years ago with their lives.\u201d Shorten and Plibersek said the executions significantly weakened Indonesia\u2019s ability to plead mercy for its own citizens facing execution around the world. They said Australia was \u201cdeeply hurt\u201d its pleas for mercy were ignored and described it as \u201ccompletely unacceptable for Indonesia to proceed as it did when critical legal processes were yet to run their course, raising serious questions about Indonesia\u2019s commitment to the rule of law\u201d. The Greens called on Abbott to also suspend the credentials of Indonesia\u2019s ambassador in Australia until the consultations with Grigson were completed. The party\u2019s leader, Christine Milne, said Chan and Sukumaran would be remembered \u201cfor overcoming their past to live meaningful lives, even from prison, not just for the way they died\u201d. \u201cTheir actions over the past 10 years were testament to their remorse, and have given many of their fellow prisoners an opportunity to live better lives,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a tragedy Andrew and Myuran were denied their own second chance. \u201cCapital punishment must be abolished wherever in the world it is still carried out. We in Australia must continue to advocate for an end to capital punishment and promote human rights around the world, especially in our region.\u201d The New South Wales premier, Mike Baird, said it was a \u201ccruel and devastating loss\u201d while the federal Labor frontbencher Jason Clare tweeted: \u201cSo sad. So bloody unnecessary.\u201d The federal Liberal MP Craig Laundy said: \u201cYesterday Chan and Sukumaran were living proof of the rehabilitative power of the Indonesian penal system. Today Indonesia killed them.\u201d Steven Ciobo, the parliamentary secretary to Bishop, said: \u201cThere are few greater displays of abuse of state power and regressive thinking than the death penalty.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
