West Ham have revamped their transfer structure this summer and Pellegrini has revealed that he agreed to replace David Moyes as manager when Sullivan, the club\u2019s co-owner, promised to make him the most influential figure at the London Stadium. \u201cWhen I spoke with him he told me he wants to build a new club,\u201d Pellegrini said during his unveiling on Tuesday. \u201cHe wants to give all the responsibility to me. He asked me also to bring a sporting director to the club, said that he will support all that I asked and that\u2019s the way we are working now.\u201d Pellegrini took charge of the search for a director of football, which ended with the arrival of Mario Husillos from M\u00e1laga, and the former Manchester City manager believes that West Ham\u2019s board have proved their ambition after breaking their transfer record to sign Felipe Anderson from Lazio in a deal worth up to \u00a342.5m. \u201cThat demonstrates that David Sullivan wants to build a strong team,\u201d the 64-year-old said. \u201cMaybe some years ago or last season the supporters were always complaining about the money spent, but when he convinced me to come here one of the reasons was that he told me he was going to bring good players.\u201d West Ham have made seven signings this summer and optimism is high after the arrivals of Anderson, Fabi\u00e1n Balbuena, Issa Diop, Lukasz Fabianski, Ryan Fredericks, Jack Wilshere and Andriy Yarmolenko. Yet they have struggled since moving to the London Stadium two years ago and supporters protested against the board during the 3-0 home defeat by Burnley in March. \u201cI knew what happened with the Burnley game,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cBut fortunately for me I have never been afraid of anything in my life. I am sure that the fans will support the club because they are seeing that something is changing inside.\u201d Pellegrini, who spent two years at Hebei China Fortune after being replaced by Pep Guardiola at City in 2016, is hopeful of adding more players to his squad after losing Andy Carroll, Manuel Lanzini and Winston Reid to long-term injuries. He wants to strengthen in central midfield and attack, although West Ham are likely to need to sell first. Michail Antonio, Sam Byram, Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9, Jordan Hugill and Reece Oxford could be surplus to requirements, while Sampdoria are interested in Pedro Obiang. \u201cWe will see what happens,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cIf any players must go, we are going to find replacements for them.\u201d Pellegrini, who led City to the Premier League title in 2014, said that the club\u2019s medical department are aware of Wilshere\u2019s poor injury record and are working on a personalised fitness regime for the former Arsenal midfielder. \u201cWe are doing a plan with the doctor and with the physical manager,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cWe are trying to do a different thing with him so he can be comfortable. And not to try to play every game because he must work in a different way. \u201cUndoubtedly he has had a lot of injuries in the past but the season he played on loan for Bournemouth he played a lot of games. Last season he didn\u2019t have too many injuries. At the moment he is working well.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
