You'll need a very large scale map to find them. But to the offshore money specialist, these can all be essential staging posts in the struggle to dodge tax. An estimated $7tn is held offshore - nearly three times the value of firms on the London Stock Exchange, with tax avoidance centres claiming to play \"an essential role in the worldwide financial structure\". Offshore accounts make legal sense for globetrotters and genuine expatriates. UK residents can also park money where ever they want around the world - but they must declare interest from tax haven bank accounts on self-assessment forms. UK tax can be legitimately deferred and sometimes reduced using \"roll-up\" funds - effectively offshore unit trusts - while offshore life policies also have some legal tax advantages as well as a wider range of potential investments. But the gains are marginal for most investors - and often more than offset by substantially higher charges. Tax havens would not exist without enticing carrots such as zero tax, total anonymity for bank accounts and no disclosure for companies. They pop up all over the globe, from the Isle of Man to far flung Pacific Islands. And this spread leads to tax dodge rule one - go for the furthest away haven. No self-respecting UK tax cheat would trust the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. They are seen as too compromised by links with the Inland Revenue. Nor would US evaders bother with the Cayman Islands or Bermuda - both are rated as \"heavily infiltrated\" by the US Internal Revenue Service. Even Russian mafias put distance between their cash and Moscow. One bank in central Asian republic Kyrgyzstan, rated by the CIA as a drugs transshipment point, offers offshore facilities in Western Somoa for nervous investors. Here's our A to Z guide to tax havens: Andorra: This Pyrenees state is best known for cheap cigarettes and budget skiing holidays. Squeezed by the Spanish and the French, it is mainly attractive to a tiny number of very rich tax refugees. Anguilla: A UK dependent territory in the Caribbean whose 9,000 inhabitants are outnumbered by 10,000 plus companies. It boasts an online registry so you can set up a company from anywhere. It has cleaned up its act from the days when anyone could open their own bank by paying $10,000. Aruba: 12 miles off the Venezuelan coast and officially part of the Netherlands. It has no banking secrecy laws and treaties with the US. Mainly of interest to shipping, property and finance companies. Belize: Best known as home of Tory party treasurer Michael Ashcroft. Companies do not need to file details of shareholders, directors or accounts. Belize \"economic citizen\" passports have been sold for $50,000. Bermuda: Home of fund operations including those from Framlington, Lazard and Tilney. Some funds are FSA recognised - these can publicise activities in the UK. \"Regulated\" funds must limit themselves to prices only, they can't show addresses or phone numbers. British Virgin Islands: A mix of low tax and secrecy. Home to trusts controlling Sir Richard Branson's Virgin. Cook Islands: Miles from anywhere in the Pacific with no tax and no publicity options. Has a unique trust set-up which remains valid even if illegal elsewhere. Gibraltar: Low taxes but no need to file accounts. It has been cleaned up over the past 20 years. Guernsey: Respectable offshore centre of little interest to UK tax dodgers. Home to \"FSA recognised\" and \"regulated\" funds. Isle of Man: Low cost alternative to Channel Islands. Cleaned up since early 1980s scandals but still offers company secrecy and low personal tax. Liked by life companies and rich UK pensioners. Jersey: As Guernsey. Labuan: Tax haven in Malaysia which has failed to attract big money. Liechtenstein: Favoured by Robert Maxwell and the most impenetrable haven in Europe. Expensive. Luxembourg: Still offers some advantages but tax evaders are wary of its EU membership. Monaco: Yesterday's tax haven. Expensive. Nauru: Eight square miles in the south Pacific. No taxes, no controls, no disclosure. Turks &amp; Caicos: UK dependency with no disclosure or recognition of \"fiscal\" crime."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
