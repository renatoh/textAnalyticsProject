Chelsea host fourth-placed Watford on Saturday having lost their past two league games to slip nine points off the top. They have dropped eight points at Stamford Bridge this season, two more than over the entirety of the last campaign. Conte has publicly pointed to a lack of alternative options in his squad and, with injuries taking their toll, has only one senior midfielder, Cesc F\u00e0bregas, fully fit following the midweek draw with Roma in the Champions League. The Italian works his players notoriously hard in training, an approach easily accepted while the team are winning. Yet there have been suggestions over recent weeks that some senior players are growing unhappy that the workload at Cobham, considered key to last season\u2019s success, has not been eased for a team enduring their second sequence of seven games in 23 days of the autumn. \u201cI don\u2019t know about this,\u201d said Conte, who has had to reduce the number of training sessions because of the more onerous fixture list. \u201cI have my methods. They\u2019re the same as last season when we won the league. Honestly, I think we are working maybe 70% less this season. Maybe for this reason we are having trouble. \u201cWe are playing every three days. When you play every three days it\u2019s impossible to work above all on the physical aspects. On the tactical aspects you have to work less and pay less attention on every detail. But when you have to play four competitions, this is the path you must follow. I repeat: the problem is [having] to play every game with the same players.\u201d Conte, who made a point of praising the Pozzo family for the team-strengthening they had sanctioned at Watford, had always envisaged a difficult campaign and had stressed in talks with the hierarchy the need to add greater depth to his squad over the summer. \u201cI was a \u2018magician\u2019 to anticipate it,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly, you hope you won\u2019t have problems in your season. But \u2026 I repeat, I stay here to work. I stay here to put all myself into this club, for the fans and the players. Me and my staff. \u201cI\u2019m a person who is not afraid to face the difficulties. My history speaks very clearly on that. I started my career very badly, with my first experience [at Arezzo] and fought against relegation. But I learned a lot from this. I have a lot of experience, as a player and as a coach, of facing this type of situations.\u201d He would not divulge whether he had spoken to the owner, Roman Abramovich, about the situation \u2013 Chelsea last lost three successive league games two years ago, when Jos\u00e9 Mourinho ended up leaving the champions before Christmas \u2013 but will not be seeking assurances on his future. \u201cThe \u2018support\u2019 is my job, my work \u2013 that is my only support,\u201d he added. \u201cTo put all myself into the job so that, when I go home, I know that, in every moment, I put everything into my job for this club, the fans, the players. If this is enough, it\u2019s OK. If it\u2019s not enough... [he shrugs]. \u201cThis season we are trying to rebuild something at Chelsea. We lost a lot of big players [over the last few years], a lot of big players who wrote the history of this club. This season we changed five players, we bought five players. We are trying to rebuild something important. It\u2019s normal that you have to \u2018pay\u2019 something in this situation. Now we are in October and we have to think about improving the present. This is the most important thing. To look at ourselves. Don\u2019t find excuses. Tell always the truth. If you always tell the truth, you can\u2019t be afraid of anything.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
