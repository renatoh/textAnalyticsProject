That remains a counter-historical imponderable. But, when Edward Hugh McGinnis, who has died aged 78, changed his name to Eddie Large and teamed up with Cyril John Mead, who called himself Syd Little, the duo Little and Large did take the place of Morecambe and Wise \u2013 in terms at least of BBC One scheduling prominence from 1978 to 1991. Large had mostly retired from the showbiz frontline in 2003, following a heart transplant. The immunosuppressant drugs necessary after such an operation put him in one of the highest-risk groups for the Covid-19 virus. From Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and Costello to Fry and Laurie, comedy double acts have often paired performers of sharply contrasting height and/or weight. Little and Large made this aspect literal, their adopted comedy personas reflecting Mead\u2019s slight, thin build and McGinnis\u2019s generous girth. Detractors might say that the literalness of their stage names was often matched by the obviousness of their comedy involving foreign accents or underdressed women. It is only fair to note, though, that they attracted 15 million viewers a week at their peak, and were known on the pier and panto circuit for their ability to draw loud and raucous laughter, especially from older audiences. Many comedy duos end in hostility \u2013 and McGinnis and Mead were estranged for many years before a couple of recent TV guest appearances. But, more unusually, Little and Large began at loggerheads. They met at a pub in Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, when McGinnis heckled Mead, who was at that time a singer-guitarist. The catcalls from the audience helped persuade the performer to abandon his music but, over a drink, the men concocted the act that became Little and Large. Under a name that baldly advertised their differing frames, the act was also unusually blunt in its division between comedian and straight man. Large got all of the gags and most of the action while Little\u2019s status as stooge involved a contribution so reduced that a running gag would involve Eddie checking Syd was still conscious. Large\u2019s jokey nickname of \u201cSupersonic\u201d for his partner \u2013 a reference from the era of high-speed Concorde air travel \u2013 also played off this extravagant passivity. Deliberately or not, the names Large and Little also reflected their contribution to the act. British television includes, three decades apart, two sets of performers who achieved fame through TV talent shows. Since 2004, the second set is those, such as Alexandra Burke and Susan Boyle, who emerged through The X Factor or Britain\u2019s Got Talent. The earlier class comprises turns who, between 1964 and 1978, emerged through peak-time auditions on ITV\u2019s New Faces and Opportunity Knocks. Among these were Les Dawson and Freddie Starr, who turned success on Opportunity Knocks into enduring TV careers \u2013 as did Little and Large, after winning the 1971 series. Although Large came from Glasgow, his accent had gradually levelled down to that of the Blackpool-born Little, perhaps encouraged by an apprenticeship on the working-men\u2019s club circuit in the north of England, so that they came to be seen as a northern duo. This may have given them an edge when, in 1977, the BBC was forced to find substitutes for the most famous Lancastrian double-act in television. Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise had left the corporation, having been offered a big money deal at ITV. Eddie Braben, the main writer for Morecambe and Wise, remained under contract to the BBC and was redeployed as main scriptwriter on The Little &amp; Large Show, which premiered with a special on the May bank holiday weekend in 1978. Braben was a master gag-writer and Eric and Ernie, without him, seemed less good on ITV. He made Little and Large seem better than they had previously been, but the key to his work with Morecambe and Wise had been creating a carefully defined comic character for each; with a double act that essentially revolved around Large\u2019s confidence and Little\u2019s diffidence, it was impossible to create a similar dynamic. Whereas Morecambe could collapse an audience with a single glance or intonation, and Wise was an accomplished singer and dancer, Large relied on a limited range of impressions (often of vintage cartoon characters), while Little\u2019s shtick depended on not doing very much at all. They did, though, get much closer to the Eric and Ernie mantle than their ITV rivals in the 1980s: another Lancashire duo, Cannon and Ball (the stage names of Robert Harper and Thomas Derbyshire.) In recent years, McGinnis\u2019s health difficulties and some family problems for Mead encouraged retrospective audience warmth towards Little and Large, on which they were able to draw by overcoming their post-TV falling-out sufficiently to appear together on Ant &amp; Dec\u2019s Saturday Takeaway in 2018 and Pointless Celebrities last year. At their height, Large, with Little, made a lot of money and a lot of people laugh. They turned out not to be the new Morecambe &amp; Wise. But then, whoever was or will be? \u2022 This article was amended on 3 April 2020. Wythenshawe is in Greater Manchester, not Lancashire as an earlier version stated. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
