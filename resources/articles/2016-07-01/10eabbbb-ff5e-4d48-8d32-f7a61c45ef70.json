His limerick, published by the Spectator as a rebuff to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s efforts to prosecute a German comedian\u2019s offensive poem, also calls the Turkish leader a \u201cwankerer\u201d. United States \u2013 April 2016 The MP for Uxbridge and Ruislip is criticised for describing Barack Obama as a \u201cpart-Kenyan\u201d who harboured an \u201cancestral dislike\u201d of Britain. He made the comments in a newspaper article after the US president supported the remain campaign during a visit to Britain. Israel \u2013 November 2015 Johnson\u2019s visit to the occupied Palestinian territories is severely curtailed by his hosts in protest at a series of strongly pro-Israel remarks. They included telling an audience in Tel Aviv that a trade boycott of Israeli goods was \u201ccompletely crazy\u201d and supported by \u201ccorduroy-jacketed, snaggletoothed, lefty academics in the UK\u201d. Japan \u2013 October 2015 Is filmed wiping out a 10-year-old Japanese schoolboy, Toki Sekiguchi, during a game of street rugby on a visit to Tokyo. United States \u2013 June 2012 Johnson tells TV chat show host David Letterman that he \u201ccould be president of the United States, technically speaking\u201d given that he was born in New York City on 19 June 1964. China \u2013 August 2008 In Beijing for the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games, Johnson said \u201crespectfully to our Chinese hosts\u201d that ping pong was \u201cinvented on the dining tables of England in the 19th century. It was. And it was called wiff waff\u201d. United States \u2013 November 2007 In a Telegraph column headlined I Want Hillary Clinton to be President, Johnson describes the Democrat: \u201cShe\u2019s got dyed blonde hair and pouty lips, and a steely blue stare, like a sadistic nurse in a mental hospital\u201d. Papua New Guinea \u2013 September 2006 In another attack on Tony Blair in another Telegraph column, Johnson wrote: \u201cFor 10 years we in the Tory party have become used to Papua New Guinea-style orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing and so it is with a happy amazement that we watch as the madness engulfs the Labour party.\u201d After later apologising for any offence caused, the then MP for Henley said he would be happy to \u201cadd Papua New Guinea to my global itinerary of apology\u201d. However, he insisted he was not mistaken about cannibalism in the country: \u201cMy remarks were inspired by a Time Life book I have which does indeed show relatively recent photos of Papua New Guinean tribes engaged in warfare, and I\u2019m fairly certain that cannibalism was involved.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
