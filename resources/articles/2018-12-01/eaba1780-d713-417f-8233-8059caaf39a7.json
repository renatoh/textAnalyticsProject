The 12 Premiership clubs, as well as the Championship leaders London Irish, will each receive around \u00a318m from the deal, having agreed to sell CVC a 27% stake. The deal was finalised on Wednesday after the clubs failed to reach an agreement at a previous board meeting. The initial approach from CVC, which made \u00a38bn from its ownership of Formula One, was \u00a3275m for a majority stake but the clubs voted against ceding control in September. While some clubs such as Bath and Saracens are likely to use the windfall for stadium redevelopments, there are concerns other clubs will look to strengthen their squads and thereby inflate rapidly growing wages. Premiership Rugby hopes such short-termism will be avoided with the \u00a37m salary cap to remain for at least the next two years and has urged the clubs to invest in \u201coperations and infrastructure\u201d having made a collective loss of \u00a328.5m last year. \u201cWe have a salary cap in place and that\u2019s not moving for the next couple of years,\u201d said the Premiership Rugby chief executive, Mark McCafferty. \u201cWe are investing in operations and infrastructure, that\u2019s the key. We will be able to invest at a greater level and build the competition out further.\u201d CVC is expected to focus its attentions on Premiership Rugby\u2019s commercial activities. Income from sponsorship and broadcasting is expected to rise significantly as a result. The clubs will be better off in the long run only if their income from central funds rises significantly more than the 27% stake acquired by CVC. Premiership Rugby also eased fears over what happens when CVC decides to sell up. \u201cThey are expecting to be in this for the long term and they understand what\u2019s required to invest and build,\u201d McCafferty said. \u201cI expect Premiership Rugby in seven or eight years\u2019 time to be an even more globally followed business. That expansion needs support.\u201d The Premiership Rugby chairman, Ian Ritchie, also denied the deal will affect the \u00a3220m Professional Game Agreement with the Rugby Football Union, which governs player release. Ritchie, who brokered the deal in 2016 when he was the RFU chief executive, described CVC\u2019s investment as \u201ccomplementary\u201d rather than being a competitor. Danny Cipriani\u2019s hopes of an England recall for the Six Nations have been significantly dented after Gloucester confirmed he would be sidelined for up to six weeks with a chest muscle injury. Cipriani was withdrawn during Gloucester\u2019s Champions Cup defeat by Exeter last Friday after the fly-half suffered a torn pectoral muscle. England\u2019s first Six Nations match is away to Ireland six weeks on Saturday with Eddie Jones expected to name his squad on 16 January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
