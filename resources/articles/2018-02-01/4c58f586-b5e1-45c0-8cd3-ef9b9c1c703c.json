Activists will attend the emergency meeting on Saturday to decide whether to endorse a motion of no confidence in his leadership passed by the party\u2019s ruling national executive committee (NEC). But Ukip\u2019s general secretary suggested that Bolton\u2019s days as leader are numbered even if he survives the vote. Paul Oakley said: \u201cHenry will be out after the local elections if he isn\u2019t out today,\u201d as the party was not prepared for May\u2019s contests. Bolton is clinging on to the leadership despite a revolt by several senior figures in the party in protest at his relationship with model Jo Marney, who sent offensive messages about Meghan Markle. Bolton said he still has \u201cstrong affections\u201d for his former girlfriend and has compared the scrutiny of his private life to that faced by Diana, Princess of Wales. Oakley told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI have no interest in his personal life, it\u2019s basically, for me, the fact that he has done nothing as leader. He is not making the case for Brexit. \u201cA particular problem is we have got local elections in May \u2013 this time in 2014 we were already well down the campaigning route and we have done nothing.\u201d The row around Marney\u2019s messages was \u201cthe last straw\u201d and Bolton\u2019s handling of the issue indicates \u201che just doesn\u2019t get it\u201d. He said the party was already having discussions about an interim leader to replace Bolton and there were \u201cthree people in the frame\u201d. Bolton hit out at the media interest following the breakdown of his marriage to Tatiana Smurova and his new relationship with Marney. He said: \u201cThe only people that are truly affected by that are my wife and children, and I feel deeply, deeply sad for what pain and hurt I\u2019ve caused them but it\u2019s a private matter and it needs to be dealt with privately. \u201cI understand the scrutiny and public interest but it\u2019s been going on for six weeks. There\u2019s probably been nothing like that since the Profumo affair or Diana and Dodi.\u201d He told Sky News: \u201cIt\u2019s been an experience I wouldn\u2019t wish on my worst enemy ... in hindsight I would have probably dealt with certain personal elements of it in a different way.\u201d The Ukip leader, who has defended his decision not to stand down, saying that the party cannot handle another leadership contest and that its constitution needs a complete overhaul, claimed he was the victim of rivals \u201cstirring the pot\u201d. He claimed those who complained about his new relationship were \u201cfailed leadership contenders\u201d who had seen an opportunity to \u201cgo in for the kill\u201d. He added that if they were truly dedicated to the party, they would have stayed at their posts. The party is facing financial ruin after a judge ruled Ukip must contribute towards a \u00a3660,000 legal bill following a defamation action brought against one of its MEPs by three Labour MPs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
