Unabashed pop, lightyears from any monkeys and/or miniature cymbals, it fidgets somewhere between Tango in the Night-era Mac (this is fine) and Future Islands (no), Alexis Taylor\u2019s forlorn falsetto flitting throughout, hoisting a simplistic major-key jig into a proper summer belter. As a festival soundtrack to sciatically invigorating cross-legged sitting, wet-wiped gussets, and slurping lager from the same paper cup you\u2019ll be weeing it back out into later, it\u2019s nigh-on perfect. Sleater-Kinney Hurry on Home It\u2019s a baffling quirk of nature that the only people able to look in a mirror and, without fail, think: \u201cWell, I\u2019d diddle me,\u201d are by far the most appalling people known to humankind. \u201cUnfuckable\u201d and \u201cunlovable\u201d are just two ways Carrie Brownstein describes herself in this whopping indie-grunge stomper, all chugging riffs, squalling twanged top-E strings and vast harmonies of joyous self-loathing. Annie Clark produced this, and you can tell. It is Very Good. Sufjan Stevens Love Yourself From the other end of the Self-Esteem Spectrum (\u00a9), and swaddled in synths that can only be described as \u201cwiffly\u201d, comes this beautiful little ode to believing in and accepting who you are, released to coincide with Pride month. Listening to it will actually make you feel a bit better about the world, which in these febrile times is basically a miracle. Does that make Sufjan God? I don\u2019t want to cause a theological ruckus here, so I\u2019ll choose my words very carefully: Yes it does. Sufjan is definitely, 100% God. Cheryl Let You There\u2019s a lot to get through this week so let\u2019s not muck about: icy, whompy, shoulderpad pop, with gusto. 8/10. Miley Cyrus ft RuPaul Cattitude It\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s hard to know where to start here. Firstly, Miley\u2019s rapping. So there\u2019s that. She says \u201cpussy\u201d an awful, awful lot. RuPaul slams in with a metaphor-obliterating verse about \u201cmilking a brother dry\u201d. And around it all is a punch-drunk splatter of bloops, bass throbs and syncopated clack-drums. As with the sight that must have greeted the English in Braveheart when the Scots lifted their kilts, it\u2019s just a bewildering amount of grot to take in all at once. Somehow, though, and I don\u2019t know how, it\u2019s almost brilliant.

A: No. Because you are not a moron."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
