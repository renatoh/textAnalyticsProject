First Glastonbury was cancelled amid fears over crowd control, then the spectre of foot and mouth cast doubts over every summer event in a pastoral setting. Yet, in the windswept and unlovely environs of a south-coast branch of Pontins, one festival at least is thriving. Now in its third sold-out year, All Tomorrow's Parties serves up three days of alternative music, crazy golf and cramped chalet-living to a 3,000-strong crowd. Even to the seasoned festival-goer, All Tomorrow's Parties is an anomalous event, as distant from the star-studded stages and corporate hospitality of a major rock festival as Camber Sands's grey coastline is from the bucolic majesty of Michael Eavis's farm. It is the anti-Glastonbury, where nobody is on drugs, nobody is covered in mud and nobody is hosting a free didgeridoo workshop or having their chakras realigned in a \"healing space\". The bands playing are so wilfully esoteric and uncommercial as to make the average Glastonbury look like Live Aid. \"Curated\" by Chicago \"post-rock\" sextet Tortoise, All Tomorrow's Parties is a parallel musical universe: here no one raises an eyebrow at the Sun Ra Solar Arkestra playing woozy, exploratory jazz while wearing extravagantly sequinned turbans, and people actually dance to the atonal, ear-rupturing racket generated by freeform guitarist Derek Bailey. In the festival's sole concession to a newsworthy commercialism, Tortoise have persuaded Television - the brainy New York punks whose 1977 album Marquee Moon remains an art-rock benchmark - to reform. Bearing in mind that Television's influence far outweighs their record sales, their surprise appearance is unlikely to oust Hear'Say from the tabloid headlines. Tortoise themselves embody the festival's uncompromising spirit - their four albums of rambling guitar instrumentals influenced Radiohead's audience-baiting Kid A - and their Friday-night set demonstrates both the advantages and drawbacks of ignoring rock music's rulebook. They display breathtaking musical range, shifting from cocktail jazz to dub reggae to filmic atmospherics, frequently within the space of one track, but they are stymied by an alarming self-indulgence (their love of the extended xylophone solo would test even Patrick Moore's patience) and a complete absence of stage presence. Live, Tortoise's furrowed brows and static postures suggest men conducting a particularly tricky chemistry experiment. The audience respond in kind. When Tortoise play Monica, a lithe sliver of Curtis Mayfield-influenced funk from their recent album Standards, nobody moves. By the end of the set, at least four members of the crowd are lying prone at the rear of the grandly named Stardust Ballroom. They are fast asleep. However, Tortoise's problems with stagecraft are minimal compared with those of Saturday-night headliners Boards of Canada. The appearance of the mysterious Scots techno duo is a surprise as they rarely play live, and their performance displays a recalcitrance that suits a band who make their records in a disused nuclear bunker. The stage is so dark, it is virtually impossible to see what's going on. Two bearded figures are occasionally visible, mournfully prodding synthesisers. Grim public information films flicker on an overhead screen and melancholy, distended bleeping fills the air. The effect is intended to be atmospheric and sinister, but Boards of Canada are so remote from their audience that they cannot generate any atmosphere or transcend their surroundings. And when your surroundings are the tatty ballroom of an off-season holiday camp, this is a major problem. Abstract techno, free jazz and post-rock are not genres generally noted for their sense of humour and, over three days, the high seriousness with which many bands perform becomes rather wearing. Alt-country collective Lambchop provide welcome light relief with a tongue-in-cheek encore of the Sisters of Mercy's overblown goth anthem This Corrosion. Even better is Sunday's set from veteran New York trio Yo La Tengo, which intersperses raging guitar noise with gently introverted pop songs and a wisecracking wit. The sense of relief when singer Ira Kaplan throws his guitar down mid-song, or chucklingly accepts a shouted request, is almost palpable: at last a band interacting with the audience, rather than playing at them. If Television's entrance bodes badly - they spend 15 minutes tuning up - the band soon ignite. The strained relations among the quartet are legendary and the atmosphere onstage is distinctly frosty, but this only seems to spur guitarists Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd on. Television have the receding hairlines and paunches of men in their 40s, yet play with a visceral passion lacking in much of the weekend. But they are from another era: in these corporate-sponsored times, it seems that some bands outside the mainstream confuse commercial appeal with the desire to entertain, and steadfastly refuse to indulge in either. A pity, particularly if you're in the audience."}, "isHosted": false}}}
