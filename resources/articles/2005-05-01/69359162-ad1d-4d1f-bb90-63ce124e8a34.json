The tale of the wife unable to resist the temptation of opening the forbidden door at the end of the gallery and finding beyond it a room lined with the mutilated bodies of former wives and - a nice touch, this - \"clotted blood all over the floor\" shook me more than somewhat. And I was 24 at the time. But what happens when we hear the bloodthirsty tales of folklore and fairytale at a more impressionable age? According to a recent study by a University of Derby student, the aptly named Susan Darker-Smith, the messages contained in them can encourage the girls who read them to become victims of abuse in later life. Beauty and the Beast, for example, is said to foster the notion than love can alter the nature of a man and may make early absorbers of the information more inclined to stay with a violent partner in the hope that she can change his behaviour. And Rapunzel is just one of many passive heroines, imprisoned in a tower and awaiting a prince on a white charger to climb up and rescue her. The question, says Darker-Smith, is why she doesn't break the door down herself. Marina Warner, author of From the Beast to Blonde: On Fairy Tales and Their Tellers, argues that Darker-Smith misreads the first tale. \"The beast treats her very well - she doesn't like him because he looks like he does. The monstrosity doesn't lie in his behaviour. It actually contains the simple, rather banal message about seeing past appearance.\" I might just lob in my own defence of Rapunzel's actions (or lack thereof) here too - according to my Ladybird book of fond memory, it's because the old crone who locked her in the tower had, in that annoyingly cunning way of old crones everywhere, deliberately neglected to include such a door. Big R did the best she could with the means at her disposal. You go, freakishly hairy girl. Still, any cursory sweep through childhood stories will reveal further examples of submissive women who were implicitly or explicitly offered up as role models during our formative years. The princess who revealed her genuinely royal status and impeccably feminine attitudes by emerging black and blue after sleeping on a dozen mattresses and a pea and was duly chosen by the ever so slightly sadistic prince. The little mermaid who sacrifices her home, family and fishy tail for a crack at the oxygen-breathing prince. Cinderella, endlessly sweeping and scrubbing floors with a patient smile on her face until her fairy godmother arrives and, with the judicious application of wand to mice and pumpkin, sends her off to the ball to meet the prince and her happy-ever-after. Snow White and her similar array of arcane domestic skills deployed in the service of seven dwarves until she's poisoned by her stepmother and has to sleep in a glass coffin until another prince wakes her with a kiss. In the copy I remember, the piece of apple is stuck in her throat and the kiss dislodges it. I always wondered how that was possible until I experienced my first Frenchie, during which Darren Masters' tongue came within inches of dislodging my pancreas. It was my first lesson in the superiority of books, with their capacity for graceful elision, over real life. But I digress. The idea that fairytales are harmful to girls is not a new one. Modern sensibilities are inevitably offended by stories that equate outer beauty with inner perfection, patient suffering rewarded with marriage and riches, obedience with femininity and so on. But remembering the characters and events of these stories does not necessarily mean they have influenced our lives to any meaningful extent. Darker-Smith relied on a small sample (67 women) to draw her conclusions, and also relied on self-reported memories and measures of how much her subjects had identified with the characters they read or heard about, a notoriously shaky indicator of the truth. It also raises the chicken-and-egg question. Do girls who identify strongly with Cinderella and her submissive like become victims because they have learned from her example, or do children with essentially submissive characters latch on to those figures because they recognise themselves in them? How else do you explain the fact that most girls are exposed to fairytales at a young age but not all of them grow up to become sufferers of abuse? And how do you account for abuse in preliterate societies? Darker-Smith's conclusions also seem to derive from what in media-studies circles is known as a \"hypodermic account\" of what happens when people read - in other words, from believing that the words on the pages are absorbed unmediated and in their entirety by the child without the reader bringing anything to bear upon them. Such a conceptualisation of the reading process has given rise to criticism before this. Even non-folkloric writers for children experienced adult fears that they were warping malleable young minds. Enid Blyton was chastised for her dominant male characters and subservient females (Julian and Dick were forever going off to challenge smugglers and stumble across gold bullion, while tomboy George was forced to try to find personal fulfilment by collecting heather for beds with natural housewife Anne) and culled from the library shelves in the 60s and 70s. CS Lewis is now criticised for pushing Christian allegory at kids via the Narnia stories and accused of being a misogynist because - I think - Peter gets to be the High King and Susan is sniffed at for liking stockings, despite the fact that Lucy is the most consistently heroic and Edmund and Eustace utter, rotten worms for large parts of their respective books. JK Rowling periodically comes under fire from assorted imbeciles for advocating occultism. But the hypodermic image is one that is falling out of favour. Dr Pam Knights, senior lecturer in English at Durham University, says, \"Impressionistically, I think children are much more active than we give then credit for. The way fairytales are used, even in picture books, is with irony. Writers assume a much greater intelligence in their readers than possibly the study does, and children pick up on stereotypes surprisingly early.\" Deborah Cameron, professor of language and communications at Oxford University, concurs with the view that children do much more complicated things with the things they hear and read than we might think, and that their influences are in consequence diluted. \"There is Bettleheim's [and others'] theory that fairytales help children work through anxieties imaginatively - what if I'm lost, abandoned, what if someone wicked tries to hurt me? - but many researchers would dispute that they have a lasting effect into adulthood, because we're always refining our view of the world. We realised it's not all polarised, not all black and white.\" Not all fairytales should be tarred with the same brush, of course. \"A lot of them - like Hansel and Gretel - are about plucky children resisting the powers of evil and cruel adults marshalled against them,\" Marina Warner points out. \"And many offer a very good way of looking, in a disguised manner, at issues like abuse in a family that lets children know that it might happen, but doesn't scare them like the tabloid insistence that there's a paedophile on every street might.\" We should also be aware that the versions with which we are most familiar have often been passed through various filters which reflect as much the mores of a particular time as they do the original tale. The eponymous heroines of Disney's late-30s/early-50s cartoons of Snow White and Cinderella, which are still among the most popular and beloved retellings, are modelled on the American postwar ideal. If Walt had made them 10 years later he would at least have had to show Snow White slumped on her bed reading The Feminine Mystique while she ate her apple. \"And Cinderella was a comic rebel figure originally,\" says Warner. \"She chops off the head of the governess who is cruel to her. It's terribly sweeping to damn all fairytales at once.\" Perhaps the only people to have had more of a field day with fairy stories than Disney have been psycho-analysts, and it is perhaps the misogynistic overtones of their interpretations that have unfairly tainted the tales. To the dedicated Freudian, the \"little red riding hood\" is a symbol of menstruation and approaching puberty, and LRRH herself the penis-hunting Oedipal child who must be eaten/castrated by the paternal imago/wolf, after the (grand)mother has been eliminated from the equation. Then she can be kissed/delivered into full femaleness by the huntsman, a man with a tendency to carry a very big gun. We need not go on. It is the multiplicity of possible readings, of course, coupled with the uncountable influences on every reader, that makes any cause and effect so hard to state. Perhaps we should turn our attentions elsewhere instead and start searching for the answer to a question posed by Professor Cameron. \"Why,\" she asks, slightly wearily, \"are we always looking for reasons why women become victims, and not at why there are still such large numbers of men around who think it's OK to beat their wives?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
