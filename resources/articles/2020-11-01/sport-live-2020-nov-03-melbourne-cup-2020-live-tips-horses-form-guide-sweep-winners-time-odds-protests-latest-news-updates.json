One of empty Flemington stands and socially distanced jockeys. It was a tragic one, too, with the death of Anthony Van Dyck. As Animal Justice Party MP Andy Meddick put it, \u201cMelbourne Cup is beginning to feel like Groundhog Day\u201d and \u201cno animal deserves to die or be injured for gambling profit\u201d. It was not doom and gloom for all, though, and Joseph O\u2019Brien got the better of his father for a second time in the headline race, as Twilight Payment put in a stunning display to win the Cup\u2019s 160th running. Out on the post-lockdown streets, Melburnians flocked to pubs, restaurants and parks for a crowd-free Cup day in temperatures that reached 30 degrees. One group in a park hooked up a TV to their vehicle. St Kilda beach was also swarming with people making the most of the hot weather. Those who stayed home were allowed to have two adults from the same household as visitors, and \u2018Fashions on The Front Lawn\u2019 is now a thing. It wasn\u2019t so positive at Victorian parliament, where an anti-lockdown rally turned ugly as police surrounded protesters and made multiple arrests. They unfurled banners such as \u201cNot Happy Dan\u201d and \u201cFree Victoria\u201d. Police circled the group just after midday, making at least a dozen arrests. Capsicum spray was used on the crowd, many of whom were not wearing face masks in line with the state\u2019s Covid-19 rules. Cheerio, and thanks for joining us. Kerrin McEvoy closes out the day a winner, steering Exhilarates to a marginal triumph from The Astrologist and Sirius Suspect. Gritty race, that. \u201cShe\u2019s had her first run down the straight,\u201d McEvoy said. \u201cIt was important to get the first half of the race right. She\u2019s a mare I\u2019ve had a bit of luck on. Haven\u2019t ridden her since earlier in the year in the Magic Millions 3-year-old race, and she ran well there.\u201d It is also a nice personal finish for the top jockey, who came so close in the Cup on Tiger Moth. \u201cHe ran great, he really did well,\u201d he said. \u201cTook me across into a forward spot. I must admit, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be that far forward. But he took me there, we had a nice trip around and he presented from the 500m moving into the race. The winner was just a bit gritty, kept going. I needed to stop, but the winner was great, and a great win by Jye.\u201d A fatality report will be prepared by the Racing Victoria Integrity Services team. \u201cThe fatality report gives consideration to the circumstances of the incident and any potential learnings to assist in the prevention of similar injuries in the future,\u201d Stier said. \u201cThe report will include the findings of a post-mortem which will now be conducted by the University of Melbourne Veterinary Clinic and we expect it will be several weeks before we have a completed report for consideration.\u201d The RSPCA has released a statement called for a review into horse racing\u2019s industry practices. \u201cWhenever there is an adverse outcome for an animal, our expectation is that the industry will do a comprehensive review to identify ways to improve in an effort to avoid unnecessary injury or trauma in the future,\u201d RSPCA Victoria chief executive Dr Liz Walker said. \u201cRacing presents numerous risks for horses and this very unfortunate incident illustrates the need for the industry to work toward better welfare for animals used in sport.\u201d Rich Hips, at pre-race 20 to 1 odds, has surprised everyone with a dash home to beat Lyre and Wild Vixen. Excellent horsemanship from Michael Dee, who is thrilled. \u201cJust got her flying,\u201d he said. \u201cShe deserves a race like this. She\u2019s always honest, runs very well. And as we saw, a very good, short, sharp turn of foot so probably better to be held up most the way up the straight.\u201d Hot off the press ... Jye McNeil enjoyed a fry-up this morning. His partner and fellow jockey Jess Payne has revealed his winning secret on television with young son Oakley (the spelling of which is the subject of debate). She is, predictably, over the moon. \u201cI sort of knew the instructions and I thought that he rode it to a tee, and gave it a bit of a kick at the top of the straight,\u201d said Payne, who not related to Michelle. \u201cI was like, \u2018Holy moly, we\u2019re in for a bit here. When it kept kicking and was being so brave and tenacious, fighting everything off, it was unbelievable. I broke down in tears. Poor Oak\u2019s probably got concussion from my jumping up and down so much. \u201cHe left the house like he would any other race meeting. And he was so calm and so collected. We had bacon and eggs for brekkie, so the breakfast of champions.\u201d Animal welfare groups including PETA have been quick to condemn the Melbourne Cup after yet another mid-race death. A common question among non-racing buffs centres around the reason horses are put down for sustaining injuries that do not appear life-threatening. There are a number of reasons for this, chief among them their inability to recover. Horses have lighter bone mass and, when a break occurs, the bone shatters, making it difficult to repair. Even if the bone does mend, there is a risk the bone will be deformed and unable to bear weight \u2013 and the horse is likely to suffer severe pain. Anthony Van Dyck fractured his fetlock, a joint in his leg, meaning his injury falls into this category. And here is a quick, succinct report of the sad news on Anthony Van Dyck. The rest of the card on Melbourne Cup day always feels a bit of an afterthought. In any case, Craig Williams got the heavily backed Purple Sector home for his fourth winner from Derby day and Cup day. Gold Fields was second and Odeon third. To catch up on the actual race, here is Mike Hytner\u2019s report. Racing Victoria\u2019s head of integrity Jamie Stier has just confirmed the news. \u201cIt is with sadness that we confirm that Anthony Van Dyck had to be humanely euthanised after sustaining a fractured fetlock during the running of the Melbourne Cup at Flemington,\u201d Stier said. \u201cThe horse received immediate veterinary care, however he was unable to be saved due to the nature of the injury sustained. Our sympathies are extended to the owners of Anthony Van Dyck, trainer Aidan O\u2019Brien and all his staff who cared for the horse and are greatly saddened by their loss.\u201d The horse, who pulled up at the 400m mark, is the seventh to die in the Melbourne Cup since 2013. Rostropovich suffered a fractured pelvis in the 2019 race and recovered. Interestingly \u2013 and, in hindsight, ominously \u2013 Bowman yesterday dismissed suggestions Anthony Van Dyck could not win because he was carrying a massive 58.5kg. It is the most a Melbourne Cup-winning horse has carried since Bart Cummings\u2019 Think Big defended his crown in 1975. Trainer Aidan O\u2019Brien also trained The Cliffsofmoher, who broke down in the 2018 Melbourne Cup and was euthanised at the track. The first few seconds of this video shows Anthony Van Dyck pulling up lame on the home straight. Bowman dismounted straight away. We are trying to bring you more information on Anthony Van Dyck\u2019s condition, which is difficult given Channel 10 is only showing a speech from Victoria Racing Club chair Amanda Elliott. In worrying news, Anthony Van Dyck broke down during the race and has reportedly been loaded into an ambulance at the track. The five-year-old stallion, ridden by Hugh Bowman, was one of the pre-race favourites. Every horse genuinely had their chance in this race and Tiger Moth pushed all the way, but Twilight Payment held a gallop and maintained it. \u201cI\u2019ve got goosebumps,\u201d McNeil said. \u201cFirst and foremost, I\u2019d like to thank (trainer) Joseph O\u2019Brien, Mr Williams, and the whole family for the opportunity today. I\u2019m absolutely stoked I could pull it off.\u201d Did he second-guess that at the top of the straight? \u201cNo, because that was always well, probably Plan A,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it was more a little bit of pressure on me just to get it right. Thankfully, it all came off. \u201cI\u2019m hoping [partner Jess] was cheering. I\u2019m tipping [baby] Oakleigh was also awake, he could have been asleep. Talking about them really makes me emotional and, yeah, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re very happy. \u201cI\u2019m tipping mum\u2019s glued to the TV at home. I\u2019m sure dad\u2019ll be watching from his throne on the tractor \u2013 he had a built of hay to do today.\u201d 1. Twilight Payment 2. Tiger Moth 3. Prince of Arran Twilight Payment was first out of the barriers and held his own the entire 3200m to give owner Lloyd Williams his seventh Melbourne Cup win. It was also jockey Jye McNeil\u2019s first Cup ride, and just after having a baby this year with his partner and fellow jockey Jess Payne. Fourth was a photo finish between The Chosen One and Persan, from Verry Elleegant. Behind them were Sir Dragonet, Russian Camelot, Ashrun, Finche and Oceanex. The horses are out of the barriers and the 2020 Melbourne Cup is under way. Ashrun immediately sneaks back to the end with Sir Dragonet. Vow And Declare jumped well, with Twilight Payment, Oceanex not too far away Russian Camelot, and also driving through is Master Of Reality. Finche is in the leading division. There is a lot of talking doing the rounds that this is the best Melbourne Cup field assembled in recent times. This 160th instalment is also inarguably the weirdest of them all. The fanfare with no fanfare. The horses are being led out now. Anthony Van Dyck is the only English Derby winner to have contested the Cup, but Prince Of Arran is the one generating the most interest. His jockey, Jamie Kah, is the only emale to participate in this race and has drawn the same barrier \u2013 No 1 \u2013 as Michelle Payne when she won in 2015 on Prince of Penzance. \u201cShe\u2019s cool and calm in there,\u201d Payne said of Kah. \u201cI got there justafter Race 3 and she was having a sleep, so she\u2019s very relaxed going into the race, which is great to see. It\u2019s a huge build-up, and she\u2019s just really ready for it today.\u201d 1. Anthony Van Dyck (Barrier 3) Ireland, 5yo stallion, Trainer: Aidan O\u2019Brien Jockey: Hugh Bowman 2.

At 3200m, this is a race for the stayers, and only a handful of the 23-strong field have long distances in their legs. Last year\u2019s winner Vow and Declare is in there, as is Surprise Baby, Prince of Arran and Stratum Albion among others. Meanwhile, all of us in the office are relieved to learn Pete Murray is alive and well, having rematerialised from the 17-year break since I saw him perform at Moore Park as a teeny bopper. More would-be racegoers Matilda Boseley: Sharon Bristoe says it hasn\u2019t felt like race day this year. She would usually head out to Echuca or one of the regional tracks on Melbourne Cup day to soak up the atmosphere but, with Melbourne\u2019s \u201cring of steel\u201d still in place around the city, she hasn\u2019t been able to travel. Bristoe and her partner Matt McIntosh headed to Bell\u2019s Hotel in South Melbourne, who are holding a socially distanced cup day event. \u201cWe have just a had our own little Melbourne cup here, and then we are back to work,\u201d she said. \u201cThere just hasn\u2019t been any lead up this year. Did the Caufield Cup even happen? I just don\u2019t know. It\u2019s been a shame to miss out on that whole spring carnival.\u201d Here\u2019s another nuggety stat: only two horses in the past 20 years have won at odds greater than $20. They were Viewed ($41) and Prince Of Penzance ($101). Stranger things have happened this year! William Pike has won on Outrageous via a 300-metre dash. Ocular put on a strong run for second in front of The Difference. It is the perfect warm-up for Pike, who will saddle up for his first Melbourne Cup aboard Steel Prince. \u201cFeeling pretty good,\u201d he said. \u201cI was pretty rapt to pick up the ride. He\u2019s a great ride to pick up. He\u2019s n good form. The barrier is tricky, but we\u2019re here on the day and we\u2019re gonna make the most of it. \u201cThis track has beena bit tricky for me, so I had a talk with Mr Hawkes and Darren through the week and tried to get a few pointers and picked a few brains, just to try and figure this track out. Because it\u2019s not as simple as it looks.\u201d Counting down to the Cup, Sir Dragonet can become the first horse since Makybe Diva in 2005 to win both the Cox Plate and Melbourne Cup in the same year. The last horse to achieve the feat before her was Saintly in 1996. Sir Dragonet\u2019s emphatic Cox Plate win last month doubled as his Australian debut. He would make history if he can do the double at his second Australian start. Glen Boss will take the reins and hope he can make the shift to firmer ground. This is from my esteemed colleague Matilda Boseley, who is on the ground in Melbourne: In a year filled with pandemics and protests it\u2019s easy to forget that the Melbourne cup has always been a controversial event. Despite a lack of crowds, animal right protesters have still ventured to Flemington racecourse to draw attention to issues within the industry. A group of horse head-clad demonstrators cracking \u201cbloody horse whips\u201d gathered outside the racing club holding signs reading \u201cNup to the Cup\u201d, and \u201cYou bet, they die\u201d, and shooting red smoke into the sky. The stunt was organised by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses. \u201cWhile media coverage glosses over the bleeding lungs, broken bones, and tragic loss of life, horses on Australian racetracks are subject to severe abuse and even death,\u201d said PETA spokeswoman, Emily Rice in a statement. \u201cHow many more deaths will it take before we call time on this disgraceful demonstration of national senselessness?\u201d Kylie Minogue is on Channel Ten, via video link from London, and she\u2019s taking a trip down memory lane. \u201cThe first memory that comes to mind is, uh, \u201888 I think,\u201d says a green silk-clad Minogue. \u201cWhere Jason Donovan and I, and maybe some other Neighbours cast members, they dressed us up. I think I looked like I was about 65 years old. In a really, really fancy race outfit. That was a good day. So, that is cemented in my memory. But I don\u2019t really have one. It\u2019s just the general, you know, the build-up and the excitement and the moment.\u201d On lockdown in London, she says: \u201cI was very grateful that I was able to keep working and be creative and, you know, I had it pretty good, I\u2019ve gotta say. But the emotional ride was still something. And I can tell you I\u2019ve never felt further away from home.\u201d For the stats enthusiasts out there, here are some fun facts and figures. Real trivia stuff, this. * First run in 1861 under the banner of the Victorian Turf Club and won by the Etienne de Mestre-trained Archer who beat the favourite Mormon by six lengths. The prize was 1420 pounds and the trophy a gold watch. * Archer came back the following year to beat Mormon, this time by eight lengths, a record margin that still stands (it was equalled in 1968 by Rain Lover). * De Mestre would go on to train three other winners of the Melbourne Cup - Tim Whiffler (1867), Chester (1877) and Calamia (1878). * Trainer Bart Cummings claimed the first of his 12 Melbourne Cups in 1965 with Light Fingers. The following year stablemate Galilee was the only horse to prevent Light Fingers making it back-to-back Cups and in 1967 Red Handed gave Cummings his third straight victory. * Cummings\u2019 other winners were Think Big (1974, 1975), Gold And Black (1977), Hyperno (1979), Kingston Rule (1990), Let\u2019s Elope (1991), Saintly (1996), Rogan Josh (1999) and Viewed (2008). * In 1972 the race was altered to the metric distance of 3200m, 18.7 metres or 61.5 feet short of two miles. * Kingston Rule holds the metric race record of three minutes 16.30 seconds. * 1985 marked the dawn of a new era for the Cup with prize money raised to $1m. The owners of What A Nuisance received $650,000 and a $23,000 Cup. * This year the race is worth $4.4m to the winning owners. * Four-year-olds (46) and five-year-olds (44) have the best record of any age group. Other age groups are three-year-old (23), six-year-old (32), seven-year-old (10) and eight-year-old (2). * The oldest horses to win the race were the eight-year-olds Toryboy (1865) and Catalogue (1938). * Bobby Lewis and Harry White are the most successful jockeys. In 33 rides in the Cup Lewis saluted the judge four times with The Victory (1902), Patrobas (1915), Artilleryman (1919) and Trivalve in 1927. He also finished third on Phar Lap in 1929. * Harry White steered the Bart Cummings-trained Think Big to successive victories in 1974 and 1975. He was back in the winner\u2019s circle again with Arwon in 1978 and another Cummings\u2019 runner Hyperno in 1979. * Think Big failed to win a race between his two Melbourne Cup wins and Vow And Declare will be trying to emulate that achievement. * Makybe Diva is the only horse to win the Cup three times - in 2003, 2004 and 2005. * Perhaps the unluckiest of all Melbourne Cup runners was Shadow King who ran in six Cups between 1929 and 1935 finishing third to Phar Lap in 1930, second to White Nose in 1931, third to Peter Pan in 1932 and second again behind Hall Mark in 1933. * The longest-priced horses to win: Four horses have won at 100-1: The Pearl (1871), Wotan (1936), Old Rowley (1940) and Prince Of Penzance (2015). * The shortest-priced are Archer 2-1 (1862), Tim Whiffler 5-2 (1867), Revenue 7-4 (1901), Phar Lap 8-11 (1930), Even Stevens 3-1 (1962), Let\u2019s Elope 3-1 (1991) and Makybe Diva at 5-2 in 2004. * Melbourne Cup winners to produce other Melbourne Cup winners:- Grand Flaneur (1880) sired Bravo (1889) and Patron (1894); Malua (1884) sired Malvolio (1891); Comedy King (1910) sired Artilleryman (1919) and King Ingoda (1922); Spearfelt (1926) sired Dark Felt (1943); Marabou (1935) sired Skipton (1941); Silver Knight (1971) sired Black Knight (1984). * Surprise Baby is a son of 2009 winner Shocking. * In 1993, Vintage Crop became the first northern hemisphere-trained horse to win. The Irish stayer was trained by Dermot Weld and ridden by Mick Kinanne and is credited with putting the race on the world stage. * In 2015, Michelle Payne became the first woman to ride the winner of the Melbourne Cup when she took Prince Of Penzance to a famous victory. Jamie Kah is given a second-to-none chance of winning on Prince Of Arran. The racecourse looks absolutely glorious, by the way. Bathed in sunshine and without the public, somehow the grass looks greener. Damian Lane puts the disappointment of King of Leogrance\u2019s earlier scratching from today\u2019s main event as he pilots Aintnodealdun to victory over Confrontational. Grinzinger Lord claims third after a photo finish. On this morning\u2019s news, Lane says: \u201cI\u2019ve been in racing long enough to know that these things happen and there\u2019s not much that you can do about it.\u201d Police are getting heavy-handed at the Melbourne protest. Wallabies great Matt Giteau has settled in for the day wearing Zoom meeting-friendly attire ... Or if you prefer horse names a little more mainstream than Alf Ramsey\u2019s Porn Dungeon, Sin To Win has broken a 989-day drought under the guidance of Luke Currie, who will ride Warning in the Cup. Second place went to Naval Warfare and third to Yonkers. \u201cHe cruised along, and I sort of got that three wide running line,\u201d Currie said. \u201cAnd on the back of a couple of horses that I was happy to follow in. So it was always going to be spotting them away. That\u2019s his style. So he was coming out and unleashed down the middle.\u201d Here is Alan Partridge\u2019s live commentary of Race 4 ... From my colleague Matilda Boseley: Michelle Paton and her friends go to the races every year, and although they can not make it to Flemington in 2020, they say it won\u2019t stop them from celebrating. They have dressed up to watch the race in Federation Square, face masks accompanying their fascinators and floral dresses. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a bittersweet day, but at least the weather has turned on, so that\u2019s amazing,\u201d Paton said. \u201cObviously it\u2019s a great time be out with friends, we have been cooped up for so long. .. we just wanted to find somewhere to get together and have a good time.\u201d Federation Square has been set up to host a large number of groups that have been barred from the course this year. The race will be broadcast on the giant screen, and fake grass has been painted with white circles, has bee. n laid out; helping to ensure the would-be punters keep a safe distance. Persistent anti-lockdown protesters have followed through on threats to descend on parliament house for another rally. A man who unfurled a banner reading \u201cFree Victoria\u201d has reportedly been questioned by police and escorted away and another maskless man arrested just before the rally began. It is surreal observing a track bereft of the masses. For the first time in Cup history the grass at Flemington is visible. There are no picnic blankets, no bubbles in plastic cups, no fake-tanned decolletage teetering about on sky-high heels. It is in this eerie environment that Craig Williams takes Alleboom to victory in race 3, a shade too strong for Hard Landing and Mr Moppett. \u201cNothing but the beautiful straight five at Flemington,\u201d says Williams, who will be all aboard Surprise Baby for the main event. \u201cSo it\u2019s a bit daunting for some horses, because it\u2019s a straight line. They\u2019re used to being trained around bends. But Richard and Chantelle Jolly, who train this horse, have done a really good job. He was in his right race today.\u201d Vis-a-vis sartorial overtures, here\u2019s Delta Goodrem and her innocent eyes earning the ire of Twitter users who seem unimpressed at her romanticisation of animal cruelty and alleged ignorance of the trackside dress code. Here is a nice story from Nino Bucci on the fashion state of play. Milliners are experiencing a dip in sales, but have had more interstate orders than previous years. David Attenborough has made an appearance on Ten\u2019s coverage. Tabcorp\u2019s chief executive, obviously. He\u2019s back by popular demand to encourage people to spend their money on his business. And thus begins the annual fixture of Gambling Binge Drinkers v Animal Welfare Advocates. Get in the spirit, people. In hindsight, that sweep conducted by Kindergarten teacher is looking pretty dubious. Which side of the fence are you on? Important to note this whole ridiculous palaver is happening mere days after allegations in Victorian parliament suggesting the slaughter of unwanted thoroughbreds is continuing in New South Wales. It also follows a study finding there is no benefit to jockeys using a whip. Animal welfare will be front and centre once again. The Melbourne Cup has long been marred by horse deaths. Two years ago Cliffsofmoher was euthanised. The Irish stallion was the sixth horse to suffer that fate since 2013. No Restriction has come out of nowhere at huge odds of $34.5 to beat Pride of Jenni and Ripper Rita. Declan Bates was the winning hoop and the Irishman, who will ride Ashrun in the Cup, says the winkers and a firmer surface helped. Here he is in his home gym. Lucky he bought this racing simulator in January because they really flew out the door when Covid hit. The party has started in Longreach, where beers are already being poured at the Birdcage Hotel. Nothing will stop the Queenslanders having some fun. The town, which has a population of about 3000, is set to peak at 38 degrees this afternoon. Some 2000km south at Flemington, best efforts are being made to keep the horses cool ... In case you aren\u2019t already aware, Jamie Kah is the Cup\u2019s only female jockey. You might not know from looking at the paper this week. Nonetheless, she\u2019ll ride Prince Of Arran, an English galloper who ran second in 2019 and is a decent shot today. Weather update! Melbourne is supposed to be building to its hottest Cup Day in six years with the Bureau of Meteorology forecasting temperatures to rise to a top of 29 degrees. Such balminess is expected to draw people outdoors to parks and gardens, and police will be out and about to ensure social distancing rules are followed. The last Cup weather this warm was in 2014 when the mercury climbed just north of 29 degrees. Take your cues from Glen Boss, who is in his paddling pool getting ready to ride Sir Dragonet. Earlier, in the first race of the day, Finance Tycoon was too strong for the fancied Ingratiating, ridden by Damian Oliver, to claim victory. Marine One came in third. \u201cThey do a good job, the juveniles,\u201d said jockey Luke Nolan. \u201cHe\u2019s always shown nice ability, but he\u2019s just been a by backward in coming forward. You know, he\u2019s just not quite there and a bit unsure about it all. But I think he possesses nice ability.\u201d Early scratching this morning, with King of Leogrance ruled out after a vet inspection, reducing the race field to 23. The five-year-old gelding was found to be lame in its off fore leg, according to Racing Victoria stewards. The decision was made just after 7.30am AEDT. Top of the morning to you all and welcome to our live coverage of the Melbourne Cup, the race that will somehow stop a nation already on pause. The race that, we are told by various Melbourne-centric outlets, will reign as today\u2019s undisputed centrepiece of a big wide world in which all its inhabitants await the result with bated breath. We are aware there are some other quite big things happening today, particularly in the US and Vienna. Gai Waterhouse, apparently, is not. The queen of the track scene has been on 2GB this morning to lambast the Victorian government\u2019s decision to ban spectators. \u201cIt\u2019s quite ridiculous really, the way they\u2019ve gone on in Victoria,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Premier there should wake up and let people go on with their business. By all means social distance \u2026 but you can\u2019t have the country cut off at the knees.\u201d We simply cannot have that. Nay, we say. So come with us on this deep dive of fan-free frolicking, fashion and turf action. And please do send us photos, videos and updates of what you are up to."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
