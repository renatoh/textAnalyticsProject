Buckingham Palace said tonight it was not ruling out legal action again the paper and its reporter Ryan Parry, who gained extraordinary access to the private rooms of the royal family, even taking photographs of cuddly toys in Prince Andrew's bedroom. Royal officials have written to the Mirror and to Parry warning them the palace could take legal action for a breach of confidentiality. The Mirror splashed Parry's tale across 15 pages today, revealing how he landed the job as a footman two months ago after responding to an advert on the official Buckingham Palace website. Parry submitted a CV, which missed out details of his journalistic career, and presented the palace with two references - one real and one fake. In what the editor, Piers Morgan, described as a \"scandalous\" lack of security, a palace personnel officer even telephoned a pub regular at a bar in south Wales where Parry used to work for a character reference, the Mirror journalist claimed today. Parry said that no serious security checks were ever carried out on him. Morgan said Parry, who was in the palace when George Bush arrived at the start of his three-day state visit, broke cover because the paper did not want to compromise the security arrangements for the president's visit. While employed by the palace on an annual salary of \u00a311,881, Parry managed to gain access to private rooms and take a series of extraordinary photographs, which appeared in the paper today. They include shots of Prince Andrew's rooms, complete with cuddly toys and embroidered pillows left behind by his daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, a picture of the suite the president will occupy taken just four days before his visit and a snap of the Queen's breakfast table. Undercover operations of this kind by journalists are often controversial - the home secretary, David Blunkett, lambasted the BBC when one of its reporters covertly joined the Greater Manchester police recently and exposed racism within the force. However, Morgan argued today the Mirror's investigation was in the public interest. Thousands of extra copies of the Mirror were printed to cater for extra demand and sources at the tabloid said it has sold \"very well\". \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
