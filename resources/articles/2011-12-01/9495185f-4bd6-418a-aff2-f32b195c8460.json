It shall be known as the Barbara Flynn Trophy For Maintenance of Studied Neutrality Under Extreme Duress. Flynn is Jill Swinburne from The Beiderbecke Trilogy and bisexual Rose Marie who set her bra at Peter Davidson's hapless doctor in A Very Peculiar Practice. I loved her then and I love her now as she does, in essence, all the voiceovers not done by Lucy Briers, Her From That Thing and No, Not Her, Her From That Other Thing. Most famously and most recently, she provided the narration for My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding. And last night, as 'tis the season to do specials, she also did the voiceover for My Big Fat Gypsy Christmas (Channel 4). Christmas weddings are like the normal weddings but \u2013 and here I would advise you to warm up your imagination before stretching it so far \u2013 more so. Nine weddings are taking place in a month at Rathkeale, temporarily trebling the population of the tiny Limerick town the Irish Traveller community considers its spiritual home. Lavinia and Edward's is the eighth. She is late to the church, hampered not by the 20 hooped underskirts comprising the bulk of her 700lb dress or the nappies designed \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 to stop the thing hurting her but by the tardy arrival of her tiara. Edward, perhaps fortunately, perhaps a tad thoughtlessly \u2013 or, given that this is not the time to be doing anything by halves, perhaps both \u2013 is even later. When he is eventually poured out of the pub and into the church, Lavinia is borderline hypothermic under her tan but sparkling gamely on. The young female guests file in wearing outfits that recall the swimsuit worn by Victoria Wood's finest creation, Kelly Marie Tunstall \u2013 cut up here, cut down there, KEYHOLE \u2013 and so tight you can only hope they're serving Canesten canap\u00e9s at the buffet. \"Sometimes, people from outside the Traveller community view the revealing outfits in a negative light,\" intones the marvellous Barbara non-committally. Go on. You try it. I said \"non-committally\". See? That's why she \u2013 and all those who come after her \u2013 should get an award. As with the original series, there are as many layers to My Big Fat Gypsy Christmas as there are petticoats to the bridal frocks and if you start searching through them you're liable to end up more confused than when you began. Is it mean? Exploitative? Ameliorator or reinforcer of prejudice against a marginalised group? Camp? Ironic? Buggered if I know, though I do have to fight the feeling that for the women the dresses function as the last redoubt against an encroaching lifetime of semi-servitude at the beck and call of men who do but little to deserve it. The small girl gazing down in delighted awe at her holy communion confection, her future wedding dress in miniature \u2013 \"It's all diamonds and actually it's beautiful!\" \u2013 made me cry for about 18 differently inexpressible reasons. There's only one thing of more perennial fascination than taste, and that is money. It is very kind of life, I think, to link them so often. In the final instalment of BBC2's Money (BBC2) series, programme maker Vanessa Engle spoke to a variety of households linked only by the fact that into each flowed the average British income for two working adults \u2013 \u00a340,000. For some, such as single 47-year-old university teacher Gerard, happy with the occasional guitar and whisky purchase, it was plenty. For others \u2013 generally good money managers and child-free \u2013 it was enough, and for some \u2013 less good managers, or those banjaxed by a sudden change in circumstances or a combination of the two \u2013 it was nowhere near. The pleasure and the power of Engle's programme lay in the extraordinary ordinariness of the participants and the honesty with which she probed and they spoke. There wasn't a sensationalist moment anywhere. It was brilliant, and most disconcerting. Imagine\u2026 (BBC1) was about books. The Last Chapter? it was called, and every other cliche was taken out for a whirl on the dancefloor shortly thereafter too. Value-adding by the iPad demonstrated by a link to TS Eliot reading The Waste Land? Why, take my hand and bow to your partner! Inscrutability of the future asserted via William Goldman's \"Nobody knows anything\" dictum and EM Forster's reworked as \"Only disconnect\" for the digital age? Come sit down here for a moment, both of you, and take the weight off! Desirability of the status quo asserted via Candide's \"best of all possible worlds\"? Get your coat, love, you've pulled. The interviewed \u2013 including Douglas Coupland, Brewster Kahle (the man building both a real and cyberarchive of every single book printed) \u2013 were wonderful; impassioned, intelligent, interested and interesting. The interviewer said things such as \"That's called 'scrolling', is it?\" when shown how to use a codex and \"Books have never lost their connection to the physical world from which they've sprung.\" What does that mean? That they've never spontaneously lost their molecular integrity? What? I bet there isn't a book in the entire Kahle library that could explain that one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
