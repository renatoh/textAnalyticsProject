Imagine our shock this morning, then, when a diminutive, thin-lipped, slap-headed Hague-a-like jumped out of a parked van and began hectoring us with his opinion that a mere 40 professional clubs in England will survive the current financial crisis sweeping football. Despite his fiendishly clever disguise, it soon became apparent that the man in hot pursuit was not former Tory leader/failure William, but undercover Manchester United plc chief executive Peter Kenyon. And boy was he feeling confrontational. \"Quite clearly, I don't think you can have four divisions of professional football any longer,\" he badgered self-righteously, as the Fiver covered its face, lashed out violently and fled for sanctuary. \"I think there are too many clubs. I can't see much beyond the first two divisions being fully professional and then a third division being semi-professional.\" Having outrun Kenyon, The Fiver hightailed it to its local discount store and pawnbrokers, The Lock, Stock &amp; Reebok Hock Shop, where friendly proprietor Big Sam Allardyce was only too happy to let us hide among his rapidly depreciating stock of Holdsworths, Warhursts and other antiques. Meanwhile, our dogged pursuer stood outside accusing frightened senior citizens of faking their own deaths in order to claim massive insurance payouts. \"Peter Kenyon wants to be an instigator in reducing an opportunity for seven or eight young lads at every professional club through the country every season. If he wants to stop that dream then so be it,\" wept Big Sam, suggesting our undercover chief executive need look no further than The Grinch Who Stole Christmas for inspiration for his next disguise. EBBE AWAY In the 1980s, Aberdeen Football Club were raking in Scottish titles and European trophies aplenty. In the 1990s, they won a couple of cups. Since the turn of the new millennium, they have achieved nothing, except develop a new brand of football which looks really great when set to The Baby Elephant Walk by Henry Mancini. This trend may explain why current manager Ebbe Skovdahl recently decided to leave his post at the end of the season. It may also explain why he's now decided to naff off next week instead. \"Ebbe is not involved in the preparations of the first team for Saturday's game against Motherwell,\" said an Aberdeen spokesman today, in no way frantically trying to rectify a fudged boardroom decision. \"He will meet with our chief executive Keith Wyness next week to dot the I's and cross the T's.\" All good and well, until a frankly worrying addendum: \"Ebbe is still around until then and we are sure he will help out!\" But before anyone could question whether Skovdahl has done more than enough already and why doesn't he just sod off with immediate effect, the conversation was steered round to his temporary replacement, a man by the spectacularly-Protestant-sounding name of Gardner Speirs. \"Gardner will be in full charge of all football matters for the interim period while we decide on the appointment of a successor to Ebbe,\" said the spokesperson in, we'll be bound, dreary monotone. \"The club is in the midst of a difficult period and we are grateful to Gardner for taking the reins just now.\" The Fiver is absolutely sure Gardner is the sort of bloke who will dig in and get his hands dirty, etc, and so on, and so forth. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"It's like taking care of a flower. If you take the roots away the flower dies. We are the heart and soul of football in this country. There are more people who come to watch Football League matches than watch Manchester United. They are just one club\" - Now when was the last time you agreed with Barry Hearn? OH, JERZY! As rubber-lipped and rubber-brained saviour of street urchins Jamie Oliver can testify, fortunes change fast in this fickle world of ours. One minute the world kicks you in the groin, the next it invites you to a party and offers you a cup of Blue Nun and a fresh chicken gizzard. \"It was so emotional and one of the best nights of my career,\" swooned Jerzy Dudek this morning. Had he struck lucky with a bit-parter from Hollyoaks? Erm, no, it wasn't quite that memorable, but he had helped title-chasing Liverpool slay First Division giants Ipswich Town. On penalties. In the League Cup. \"It wasn't easy for me to play after a few bad games but the fans and players were brilliant. Everyone gave me confidence, they didn't let me down,\" gushed Jerzy. So it's three cheers for the rejuvenated and resurrected Jerzy Dudek, then, hey? Ah, no. \"The boss told me before the game that I don't yet know or understand how special our fans are,\" he confessed. \"He told me they would make sure I wasn't walking alone and I saw that for myself.\" So it was Gerard not Jerzy who made Liverpool great once again. \"That's right. I made the decision to play Jerzy on Sunday night after the United game,\" bragged the boggle-eyed big cheese, high-fiving himself with gusto. \"I even kept it away from my assistant Phil Thompson that I wanted to play Jerzy,\" he cackled, \"for the best way to recover from a bad patch is to play games.\" Ah well, it matters not who's to thank, the important thing is that things again look rosy in the Anfield garden. A clean slate. No harm done, then. \"I have never had a spell like this in my career,\" grumbled Jerzy, stroking his face furniture and wiping his sweating brow. \"I just have to make sure I come out of this bad period as soon as possible and I know I have the backing of everyone at the club to help me do that.\" Everyone bar Gerard, that is, who's only gone and replaced Dudek for Saturday's game at Charlton with Chris Kirkland, the best young keeper in England no less. Never mind, Jerzy, someone we know tells us Spain's nice this time of year. THE RUMOUR MILL Aston Villa's Gareth Barry is on his way to Spurs. Hirsute Turkey goalkeeping warlord Recber Rustu is on his knees begging Sir Alex Ferguson to take him to Old Trafford. Francis Jeffers is trying to locate the Highbury exit.
