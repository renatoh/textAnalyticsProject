The combined effect of growing stock markets and a renewed urge to save for old age by individuals and some governments drove up funding in most western countries, said City based data provider International Financial Services, London. Norway's decision to stash most of its oil revenues in a centralised, state controlled pension fund, now the largest single fund in the world, and a higher savings ratio in eastern European countries such as Hungary, Poland and Czech Republic, contributed to the rise in global assets. China, South Korea and Latin American countries are also expected to ramp up their savings, adding to the expectation of further significant rises in global pension assets in the next few years. However, the US remained the largest source of pension fund investments, dominating the scene with 67% of all funds invested compared to 8% from the UK and 6% from Japan. In the US, Australia, Canada, Ireland and UK pension fund assets are equivalent to 50% of GDP. The report said these figures were historically high, but failed to reach some smaller countries, particularly the Netherlands and Switzerland, which have extensive pension funding arrangements and assets equal to 100% of national income. In the UK the pensions industry manages \u00a3850bn, mostly invested in equities. Last year the proportion of funds invested in equities was 66%, down from 82% 10 years ago. Most of the cuts have occurred since the stock market crash which saw UK shares lose more than half their value between 2000 and 2003. Regulators forced companies to divest themselves of shares and buy less risky and lower performing bonds. At the same time, the report reveals, other countries had increased the proportion of equities in their funds and enjoyed huge growth. The report said that while a proportion of the UK workforce was covered by funded pension schemes with enough assets to provide a decent pension, many others would rely on a poorly funded state system or, if they are public sector workers, unfunded benefits that would soon prove unaffordable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
