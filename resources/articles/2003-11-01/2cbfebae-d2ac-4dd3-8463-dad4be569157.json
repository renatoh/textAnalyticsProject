The Stop the War Coalition, the organisers of the march and a Trafalgar Square rally, said it was the UK's biggest ever weekday demonstration and put the numbers attending at over 200,000. Scotland Yard said it had estimated participants at 70,000. The protest began with a march through central London. Slightly delayed from its 2.30pm start time, it moved swiftly through the West End and South Bank before crossing Westminster Bridge, past parliament and Whitehall, and then into Trafalgar Square. Noisy but well-disciplined, the protesters carried banners with the single word \"Bush\" printed above a splatter of blood, blew whistles and chanted \"George Bush, terrorist\". Some had customised the placards or brought their own. One read: \"Get the hint, go home.\" Others waved Palestinian flags. Shortly after 5.30pm demonstrators in Trafalgar Square pulled down a papier-mache effigy of Mr Bush with Tony Blair in his pocket in an attempt to re-enact the iconic moment on April 9 when US soldiers and Iraqi civilians brought down a statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad. The Blur frontman Damon Albarn, at the front of the march, told the Press Association that it was a \"smart march for smart people\". \"My reason is the same as those taken by people collectively today ... and Bush's visit is an opportunity to re-express what they feel,\" he said. Bill Hoyes, 72, from Stevenage, said he had come along to call for greater involvement by the UN in Iraq. \"I'm opposed to Bush and Blair fighting an aggressive war and invading a country that could not defend itself.\" The Metropolitan police's deputy assistant commissioner, Andy Trotter, said that the conduct of the march was good tempered and there had been no particular problems. A total of 5,123 officers policed the route as part of one of the largest ever security operations in Britain. Parliament Square, Whitehall and St James's Park today saw a huge police presence as Mr Bush visited Westminster Abbey and 10 Downing Street for talks with Mr Blair. Addressing the protests, the president had yesterday spoken of his enthusiasm for free speech but a joint press conference today with the prime minister was dominated by the twin bombings in Istanbul. \"The nature of the terrorists is evidenced once again - we see their utter contempt for innocent life. They hate freedom, they hate free nations,\" he told reporters. The bombings were taken as evidence by some of the protesters that the war on terror was not succeeding in making the world safer. Caroline Lucas of the Green Party told the rally it showed that \"our world is anything but more secure\". Anas Altikriti, spokesman for the Muslim Association of Britain, told the crowd that tonight would be a celebration of belief around the world. \"It is a night where once again we speak loudly, we stand proud and we stand shoulder to shoulder with our brothers around the world who are victims of the policies of Tony Blair and George W Bush.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
