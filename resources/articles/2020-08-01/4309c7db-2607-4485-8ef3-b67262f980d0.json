In a speech on the third night of the Democratic national convention, airing directly after Senator Kamala Harris was due to officially accept the party\u2019s nomination to be vice-president, the former president was expected to attack Republican efforts to sabotage mail-in voting and ballot access. \u201cPresident Obama will highlight the cynical moves by the current administration and the Republican party to discourage Americans from voting,\u201d a spokeswoman, Katie Hill, said in a statement before the speech. \u201cHe\u2019ll make a pointed case that democracy itself is on the line \u2013 along with the chance to create a better version of it.\u201d Trump has for months been working to destroy faith in mail-in voting, which an unprecedented number of voters were expected to use in November owing to the coronavirus crisis, which has killed more than 170,000 Americans. The Trump presidential campaign on Wednesday sued the state of New Jersey over a plan by the Democratic governor to mail a ballot to every household. The Trump campaign previously sued Nevada on similar grounds. While the cases have not been resolved, states have broad authority to set their own voting rules. According to speech previews, Obama was prepared on Wednesday night to respond to the Trump campaign by amplifying what Democrats have long been saying: Trump does not want people to vote because he knows that if they are allowed to, he will lose. In some selected excerpts released ahead of the speech, Obama was set to say: \u201cDonald Trump hasn\u2019t grown into the job because he can\u2019t. And the consequences of that failure are severe.\u201d He will add: \u201cHe\u2019s shown no interest in putting in the work; no interest in finding common ground; no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself ... no interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show.\u201d In its third day, the Democratic convention, at which Biden was officially nominated as the party\u2019s presidential candidate on Tuesday, was planned by organizers to build momentum with an increasing deployment of star power. In addition to Obama and Harris, Senator Elizabeth Warren and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi \u2013 both of whom have seen their popularity with Democrats rise over multiple rounds of public battle with Trump \u2013 were scheduled to speak late on Wednesday. Musical performances were expected from Billie Eilish and Jennifer Hudson. And something of a tantalizing mystery surrounded the plans of another scheduled speaker, Hillary Clinton. It was unclear whether her anticipated digs at Trump would tacitly draw a contrast with a presidency that could have been: hers. Clinton last week raised the alarm about the fragility of democracy after the postmaster general, a Trump mega-donor, announced cost-cutting operational changes to the US Postal Service (USPS), in a move critics said was an effort to rig the election. \u201cTrump and Republicans aren\u2019t just trying to dismantle the USPS \u2013 a crucial American institution,\u201d Clinton tweeted. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to dismantle American democracy, and using a deadly pandemic they made even deadlier to do it. We have to fight back and we have to win.\u201d After being called to testify by two congressional committees, the postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, announced on Tuesday that the operational changes would be delayed until after the November election. While the Democratic convention\u2019s virtual format, in which speakers address the all-online audience remotely from home studios across the country, has muted the impact of some speeches, a rousing address by former first lady Michelle Obama on Monday night showed the possibilities of the form. Democrats were expectant about the return to the national stage of Barack Obama, the party\u2019s premier get-out-the-vote cheerleader, in a contest where voter enthusiasm could be unusually important in navigating unpredictable election day dynamics. In helping to drive record turnout for Democrats during the 2018 midterm elections, Obama frequently chastened crowds who jeered Trump administration misdeeds with a phrase he seemed sure to reprise on Wednesday: \u201cDon\u2019t boo. Vote.\u201d Obama remains a strongly popular figure among Americans, with 55% overall approval according to YouGov, versus 39% who approve of Trump. The former president was also expected to speak about why he believes Biden has \u201cthe experience and character\u201d to take the reins of the presidency, at a time when a historic majority of Americans say the country is headed in the wrong direction. Biden and Obama have been seen as unusually close political allies. After running against Obama in the 2008 presidential primary, Biden agreed to join the ticket as vice-president on the condition that he would have Obama\u2019s ear. Through the administration\u2019s eight years, the two ate lunch together most days and Biden was seen as an unwaveringly faithful lieutenant. After Biden was formally nominated at the convention on Wednesday night, Obama marked the news with a personal tweet. \u201cCongrats, Joe,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
