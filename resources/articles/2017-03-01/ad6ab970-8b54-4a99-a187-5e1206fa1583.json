Many cars sported bumper stickers, pro-Bernie and pro-union. They came in school buses, hot rods, church vans and motorcycles, with license plates from Missouri, Texas, North Carolina, Illinois and Pennsylvania. A delegation of a dozen Nissan workers even came from Brazil, to support United Automobile Workers (UAW) activists who have faced illegal retaliation in a 13-year struggle to unionize the Japanese giant\u2019s 5,000 workers in Mississippi. \u201cI feel their pain because we have been through the same thing with Mercedes,\u201d said Kirk Garner of Vance, Alabama, who has been part of the decade-long UAW effort to unionize there. Two weeks after the defeat of the Machinists Union at Boeing in South Carolina, an estimated 5,000 southern union activists gathered in Canton to lay the foundation of what they hope will be the large-scale community movements necessary to defeat anti-union forces nationwide \u2013 and in the White House. Community support is proving essential for union drives, as companies use politicians and expensive media buys to counter such campaigns. In South Carolina, Boeing spent $485,000 on TV ads and politicians warned that a successful union drive would discourage other companies from moving to the region. In 2014, anti-union forces used a similar strategy to defeat a high-profile attempt to unionize Volkswagen in Chattanooga. In Mississippi, as the UAW seeks a vote, Nissan has begun airing its own anti-union ads this week. The UAW claims that the company has told staff that if they unionize, the plant will move to Mexico. The company has denied the charge. In an email to the Guardian on Sunday, the Nissan corporate communications manager Parul Bajaj said \u201cthe allegations made by the union are totally false\u201d and accused the UAW of a \u201ccampaign to pressure the company into recognizing a union, even without employee support\u201d. High-profile company ad campaigns can turn communities against unions. Workers often face not just intimidation from their bosses but also peer pressure from friends and neighbors, who warn of harm to the local economy. \u201cI don\u2019t think the pressure was as intense as it is now,\u201d said GM worker John W Hill Jr, who was part of the first successful UAW effort to unionize at a GM plant in Monroe, Louisiana 41 years ago. \u201cIn 1976, there wasn\u2019t the harsh anti-union sentiment that is so prevalent over the country right now \u2026 We didn\u2019t have all the politicians and everybody against us. \u201cI hope whenever the [Nissan] election is that they vote yes. But deep down inside, I think there is so much fear here and disconnect that I just don\u2019t think [they will].\u201d Hill was interrupted by a Nissan worker with a toddler on his shoulders: \u201cNah, man, we got this, we got this. We are gonna beat them.\u201d As they marched on the plant on an unusually warm March day, workers sang: \u201cWe are ready, we are ready, we are ready, Nissan.\u201d They have organized a community coalition, the Mississippi Alliance for Fairness at Nissan, that includes #BlackLivesMatter activists, church groups, the Sierra Club, the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The coalition is calling for a mobilization not seen in the south since the civil rights movement of the 1960s. More than 80% of Nissan\u2019s workers in Canton are black. A win at Nissan could be a game-changer. On Saturday, they had a guest speaker. \u201cIf we can win here at Nissan, you will give a tremendous bolt of confidence to working people all over this country,\u201d Bernie Sanders told a crowd of 5,000. \u201cIf you can stand up to a powerful multinational corporation in Canton, Mississippi, workers all over this country will say, \u2018We can do it, too.\u2019\u201d \u2018We know a union could help\u2019 Out of 43 of Nissan plants worldwide, 40 are unionized. The only plants that are not are the one in Canton, Mississippi and two in Tennessee. Workers say the lack of a union makes a difference. Bajaj said Nissan \u201crespects and supports\u201d employees\u2019 decisions about who represents them. Many employees in Canton say they make less than $15 an hour, with starting wages for some at $13.46 an hour. Workers say they make $2 less each hour than those in Smyrna, where Nissan faces competition from unionized GM factories. Bajaj countered that the company\u2019s \u201chourly wages are significantly above the average central [Mississippi] production wage of $16.70 per hour\u201d. Many Canton workers also say they are forced to work for years as temporary employees and complain that they are denied vacation, only allowed to take time off in the last week of June and the first week of July \u2013 when the plant shuts down. Without a union, they say, workers are often forced to work in unsafe conditions. Since 2008, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) has cited Canton facilities six times. In February, Osha issued a citation for a failure to have proper safety lights indicating when machines were on and for not instructing workers to turn off machines before fixing them. \u201cI had to call [Osha] twice in the past month,\u201d said Karen Camp, who works in the paint shop. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t see 10ft in front of your face because of the ventilation problems. We know a union could help fix it.\u201d In his email, Bajaj said: \u201cThe safety and well-being of our employees is always our top priority. We dedicate extensive time and resources to safety programs and training at the plant.\u201d The Canton plant, she added, \u201chas a safety record that is significantly better than the national average for automotive plants\u201d, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Workers say Nissan has fought the union every step of the way. In 2015, the National Labor Relations Board charged that the company and its temporary employee agency provider, Kelly Services, violated workers\u2019 rights, with one manager threatening to close the plant if it went union. Nissan has said it is defending against the charge. Workers say the company routinely imposes one-on-one meetings, where they are questioned about their views on unionization and have their work histories reviewed. Some say those who support the union are routinely denied promotion. Others say pro-union workers have been unfairly let go. In March 2014, a 43-year-old pro-UAW Nissan worker, Calvin Moore, who had worked in the plant since 2004, was fired. Many workers began to protest. The actor Danny Glover, a supporter of Nissan workers who was also present at Saturday\u2019s march, with NAACP president Cornell William Brooks, called a press conference to denounce the firing. Students from Jackson State and Tougaloo College engaged in civil disobedience at Nissan headquarters. Workers in Brazil organized protests in solidarity. Three months later, Moore was hired again. The win put wind in the union\u2019s sails. \u201cIt bolstered people\u2019s spirits,\u201d Moore said on Saturday. \u201cTo be honest, people were happier for me than I was for myself.\u201d Moore said community support and events, such as the March on Mississippi, were key to winning support among coworkers. \u201cWe have had a lot of non-union workers who have changed their mind about the UAW,\u201d he said. \u201cEvents like this should help us get more support, especially when people see this on TV.\u201d \u2018If there was ever a movement to be lead\u2019 High-profile labor efforts could prove crucial not just to unions in the coming months and years, but also to Democratic attempts to win back Congress and the White House. Last year, Donald Trump won the largest share of union voters for a Republican since 1984. He has since focused on bringing manufacturing jobs back to the US. However, with many of these new jobs being temporary, Democrats feel they can win union voters back by focusing on how to improve such jobs. Such a strategy, if successful, may not just to win back blue-collar voters. It could also help soften racial tensions that have spread among manufacturing workers. With Republicans fighting unionization nationwide, the incoming Democratic National Committee chair, Tom Perez \u2013 who was labor secretary under Barack Obama \u2013 has signaled that he intends to focus on supporting efforts to unionize. In Canton, workers said their efforts could provide a model for the progressive movement in the age of Trump. \u201cIf there was ever a movement to be led,\u201d said Mississippi NAACP president Derrick Johnson, \u201cit would be led out of Mississippi, because we have always lead the movement.\u201d Mike Elk is a member of the Washington-Baltimore NewsGuild.
