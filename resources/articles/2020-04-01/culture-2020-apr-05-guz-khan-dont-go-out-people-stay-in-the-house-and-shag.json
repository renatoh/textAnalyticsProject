Stay in the house and shag'", "bodyText": "Coventry-born Ghulam \u201cGuz\u201d Khan, 34, was an RE teacher who started performing standup in his late 20s. After his YouTube videos went viral, he gave up his day job to pursue a full-time career in comedy. He now co-writes and stars in his own sitcom, Man Like Mobeen, the third series of which has just arrived on BBC One (Mondays at 10.45pm). How are you coping with coronavirus shutdown? Still alive innit, so that\u2019s a positive. You\u2019ve got to take the positives where you can because it\u2019s a mad mess out there. We\u2019re being good and following government guidelines. Everyone has to take this seriously. Don\u2019t go out, people. Stay in the house and shag instead. Just before the lockdown, you did standup in the US for the first time. How did it go? A bit weird. When the MC introduced me and I walked onstage, a couple of guys in the front row immediately tutted, folded their arms and started frowning. I took that as a challenge. That\u2019s the beauty of standup. Within 10 minutes you can go from \u201cI can\u2019t believe they gave this Muslim a microphone\u201d to \u201cI love this dude, he\u2019s hilarious\u201d. How would you describe Man Like Mobeen to newcomers? In some ways it\u2019s a traditional sitcom in the vein of Only Fools and Horses, but we felt the show was in a unique position to make you think as well as laugh. We discuss issues like racism, sexism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, police prejudice\u2026 Art Malik plays a crime boss in the new series. How was working with him? He\u2019s a legend. Looking at casting tapes, we were like: \u201cIf we don\u2019t get Art Malik, the show is ruined.\u201d When he arrived on set, we tried to be clever and discuss how he perceived the role. He turned around and said: \u201cGuys, just tell me what the fuck to say and I\u2019ll say it.\u201d You\u2019ve been called \u201cthe new face of British Muslims\u201d. Is that a pressure? It\u2019s impossible to always say the right thing and please everyone. I felt one responsibility and that was to Small Heath in Birmingham \u2013 an area often maligned in the local media. I wanted people here to feel proud and identify with the characters. The overwhelming majority were happy, so I am too. Do you get criticism from the Muslim community too? Of course. Usually about swearing. Somebody messaged me on Instagram asking why I\u2019d said \u201cshit\u201d, so I clicked on their profile and there was a clip of Nicki Minaj twerking! The Muslim community is a complicated set of people. All I can do is try to speak the truth. The show is shortlisted for the Visionary Honours, a social impact award, for its insights into working-class life as an ethnic minority. Does that make you proud? It did until I saw that When They See Us [Ava DuVernay\u2019s Netflix drama based on the true story of the Central Park Five] is in the same category. I went on Twitter and told people to vote for that instead. Listen, Man Like Mobeen is sick but When They See Us is one of the most important bits of TV of the past decade. You\u2019re also up against Ross Kemp, RuPaul and David Attenborough\u2026 Imagine that party! Let\u2019s set it up as soon as quarantine ends. You launched a scheme for local youngsters to get paid experience on your production team. Why? Our crew are incredible and I love them to bits but they\u2019re overwhelmingly white dudes. I can talk the talk but unless I facilitate it, I\u2019m a paigon, as Stormzy says. We do a good job of representation on-screen but wanted to get working-class kids behind the camera too. A few comedians are former teachers \u2013 like Romesh Ranganathan and Dawn French. What makes it good preparation for standup? Broadly there are two types of teachers. Ones who are all about the curriculum and imparting knowledge, then ones who understand that we have human beings sat in front of us who are going through all kinds of shit every day, so let\u2019s chat to them and entertain them. The second type are the ones who become comics. There\u2019s no better training in crowd-work and navigating emotions. That tough gig in America was nothing compared with a year 9 girls\u2019 health and social care lesson. Those girls were danger. Do your former pupils come to gigs and watch you on TV? They do, which is a lot of fun, but they\u2019ve grown up so quick. One girl came to see me recently and her boyfriend looked about 40. I felt like calling the police! Who were your comedy heroes growing up? Eddie Murphy and Dave Chappelle. From the UK, Lee Evans and Peter Kay. Chris Morris is so unique too. But none of them compares with my old dear, who lives next door to me now. Pound-for-pound, she\u2019s the funniest person you could hope to meet. I said the other day, \u201cMum, we should do a show together\u201d and she was like \u201cDo I look like Romesh\u2019s mum, mate?\u201d There\u2019s no messing with her. The BBC comes in for a lot of criticism. What do you think of it? It\u2019s such a broad-ranging organisation. It\u2019s a fragmented eco-system, staffed by people with completely contradictory opinions. These are confusing times, but without the BBC it would be a lot worse. What\u2019s next for you? I\u2019m trying to write a sitcom about my teaching days. Let\u2019s face it, there\u2019s plenty of time to write at the moment. Right now is the time for creating ideas. Not just for me, but for anyone. If you\u2019re working in an Amazon factory and can\u2019t take much more, download an app called Final Draft and start writing. The world needs new voices."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
