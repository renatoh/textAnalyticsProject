If West Ham United win the right to becomes tenants of the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games, it would provide for the regeneration of three separate sports facilities in London. Adding to the dual West Ham-UK Athletics occupancy of the Olympic Stadium and the already-advanced plans for the redevelopment of White Hart Lane would be Palace's vision for a 25,000-seat purpose-built football stadium at a revamped NSC site in Crystal Palace Park. \"Along with the athletics at the Olympic Park, we'd seek to provide a new aquatic centre here to dramatically improve the facilities' usage and drastically reduce the cost of the upkeep [of the NSC],\" said Palace's co-owner Steve Parish. That would be welcome news to critics of Tottenham's project. The NSC is losing \u00a31m a year and Spurs' detractors say their football-only plans for the Olympic Park \u2013 which would see an athletics-only redevelopment of the NSC \u2013 would only displace the underlying financial problems inherent in an underused athletics facility to the NSC. Spurs have not commented on Palace's plans but privately scoff at their claims of viability, in the belief that the scheme is not appropriately funded. Parish countered with talk of \u00a350m raised from a combination of the redevelopment of Selhurst Park, new-stadium naming rights and pre-sales of corporate and debenture seats. Palace's owners have not ruled out their own equity investment and, while acknowledging the difficulty in the current financial climate, talk of possibly approaching debt markets for support. Even if Spurs win their tender for the Olympic Stadium, though, Parish believes there is mileage in his plans. Palace have considered building a new 25,000-seat dual-use football-and-athletics stadium capable of expansion to 40,000 seats. Alongside it would be an aquatics centre and athletics track, maintaining the NSC's character. Palace have held what Parish described as being at best \"tentative\" talks with Spurs and it would not be his preferred option. Nevertheless he would not capitulate. \"I think if athletics doesn't stay at the Olympic Stadium \u2013 if the Spurs bid wins \u2013 these plans would be superseded,\" said Parish. \"But I still think there is a conversation to be had about building a stadium that is dual use for athletics and football from the ground up. Any football club wouldn't want to have a track around the football pitch and our preference would be to have a stadium ourselves. But this site was the home of Crystal Palace in 1905 \u2013 we played there until 1914. I can't see anyone having objections to Crystal Palace Football Club moving to a place called Crystal Palace.\" Yet despite hoping to explore a partnership with Spurs, Parish is enough of a football fan to give his candid views on their hopes of relocation into West Ham's Newham hinterland. \"It would be like Charlton Athletic moving to Croydon,\" said Parish. \"If you said that was happening I would think you were criminally insane. I thought the last time we lost our senses was letting Wimbledon move to Milton Keynes and that we wouldn't let that happen again. As a football fan I think it's a nonsense but that doesn't mean it isn't going to happen.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
