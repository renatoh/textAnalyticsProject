The independent report, released on Thursday, found that the broadcaster\u2019s most popular radio host \u201cconsistently breached\u201d network policies on appropriate behavior and often fell \u201cwell below\u201d the expected standard. Censored to remove the names of other employees and specific accounts of notorious incidents, the report by labour lawyer Janice Rubin describes a \u201cmoody, difficult and emotionally unpredictable\u201d host who was \u201cdeeply disrespectful\u201d toward fellow employees. More pointedly, it also describes in detail how Ghomeshi\u2019s superiors at the network consistently ignored complaints about his behaviour and proved \u201call too ready to believe his version of the truth\u201d. The report found that the CBC missed several opportunities to discipline Ghomeshi when credible complaints about his behaviour arose, deciding instead to protect their most popular radio host \u2013 and the only one with a significant international reputation. As the report came out, the CBC said it had \u201csevered ties\u201d with two senior employees. Former head of CBC Radio Chris Boyce and human resources director Todd Spencer had been placed on leave when the scandal erupted in October. CBC also laid off another 244 employees as part of ongoing retrenchment in response to government funding cuts. Ghomeshi was fired in October after several women came forward to allege that he had assaulted them in non-consensual sex. He is facing seven counts of sexual assault and one of overcoming resistance by choking, but has plead not guilty to all charges. The new CBC report included descriptions of a \u201csmall number\u201d of sexual harrassment complaints in the workplace, as well as unwelcome touching and flirting, but focused more on management\u2019s failure to respond to building complaints from outside the CBC. The CBC was not aware of any internal complaints of sexual harassment, according to the report. One woman submitted a complaint to her union, it says, and it was the union that failed to investigate. \u201cWe accept the general conclusions of the report, though troubling and disappointing; they point to lapses in our systems and concerns about our culture,\u201d CBC president Hubert Lacroix said following release of the report. \u201cMost importantly, we want to sincerely apologise to our employees who experienced inappropriate behaviour in our workplace and to Canadians who have put their trust in CBC/Radio-Canada as the country\u2019s public broadcaster.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
