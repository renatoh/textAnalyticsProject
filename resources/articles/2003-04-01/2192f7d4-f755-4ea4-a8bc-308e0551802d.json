If scoring a last-minute Cup final winner sounds like fantasy, in Nielsen's case it need not be: he has done it before. Four years ago the Dane headed the late goal which enabled Tottenham to beat Leicester and lift the Worthington Cup. \"I have got that back in my memory,\" he says. With his Spurs connections, a repeat against Arsenal in this year's FA Cup final might appeal. Nielsen's friends have been telling him the script is prepared so that his last action before moving back to Denmark will be in the Millennium Stadium. \"Let's see what happens,\" the midfielder cautions, aware that Southampton must be overcome. But the thought excites him. \"I have been to the World Cup and we got to the quarter-final there [losing narrowly to Brazil in 1998],\" he says, \"but scoring a goal in the Cup final, and the winner, you can't get much better.\" Nielsen's contract at Watford expires this summer and, with the financially troubled club having not yet offered an extension to one of their highest earners, his sights are set on continuing his career from Copenhagen. From there he thinks he will stand a better chance of adding to his 45 caps, the last of which came 13 months ago. A decision to leave England is not yet final but looks increasingly likely. \"My plan so far is to bring back the family to Denmark,\" Nielsen says. \"We have been here seven good years. My children are three and six now, and were born here. This is their home at the moment [but] we're planning because I don't want to sit down in June and suddenly say: 'Let's go back.' I want to prepare them. They can talk to their friends and have a farewell party and so on.\" This season, Nielsen admits, has been tough. In September Watford's staff agreed to take a 12% wage deferral to avoid the possibility of administration. Yet out of that adversity has come a unity which has helped the club unexpectedly reach this semi-final. \"We just had to accept the situation and get the best out of it,\" Nielsen says. \"If we had turned our back we wouldn't have gone anywhere. But we stuck together and just said: 'No moaning or complaining. This is what we are, this is what we've got, carry on from there.'\" He credits the manager Ray Lewington with helping to instil the team's spirit. \"What you learn in the First Division is to fight,\" Nielsen says. \"We have got a good attitude in that department, coming from our manager. \"He's a fighter. He knew what was going on financially when he took over the club and to still accept the job suggests you are a fighter. You know you don't have money to spend, so that's the strongest asset from this team: the fighting spirit and togetherness.\" Nielsen has seen various sides of Watford since he was signed by Graham Taylor after falling out of favour with George Graham at Tottenham. A first season which faded was followed by disappointment under Gianluca Vialli. Nielsen's hope of returning to the top flight remains unfulfilled, but a Cup final would be some consolation. He is more than happy to play the underdog tomorrow. \"I've been in the situation where you are favourites,\" he says, \"and it's always slipping through your mind: 'Oh, they play in the First Division, it's going to be an easy game.' You never want to think that, but it always slips in there. I don't mind Southampton thinking that.\" Nielsen's thoughts are on going out with a bang, managing something to rival that 1999 final with Spurs. \"Definitely that will be the top memory,\" he says, \"and hopefully now there will be another one.\" Marcus Gayle Marcus Gayle already has a career after football lined up. On Thursday he got the keys to a shop along Fulham Broadway and work should begin next week on turning it into a clothes store, with the grand opening planned for July. \"Well too late for any Cup final suits,\" he muses, though he would probably be happy to wear a binbag to Cardiff next month given the chance. Gayle knows he is never likely to have a better opportunity of reaching his first final than with Watford tomorrow. His career has not lacked highs, even featuring an appearance at France 98 with Jamaica, but in domestic cup competitions the 32-year-old has hardly enjoyed the best of luck. In the space of five weeks with Wimbledon in 1997 he had to stomach defeat in two semi-finals. First, Leicester knocked Joe Kinnear's team out of the Coca-Cola Cup after Gayle scored what he hoped would be the winner, then Chelsea hammered them 3-0 in the FA Cup at Highbury. \"Both bad memories,\" Gayle reflects. \"I've never played at Wembley or Cardiff, so I'd like to put that record straight. So far we're on course. \"At Wimbledon, the Leicester defeat was the really hard one. We took the lead in the second leg, through me, ended up conceding a goal in the second half and went out on away goals. In the FA Cup, Chelsea were magnificent and we couldn't compete with them.\" With a division separating Watford and Southampton, some envisage another mismatch, though Gayle believes it will be anything but. He points out that Watford have not conceded a goal on this Cup run, which includes games against West Bromwich and Sunderland, and senses the players are mentally ready for the challenge. Gayle has been doing his best to offer advice to the youngsters this week, telling them to relax and make sure they take in the occasion. He intends to do just that himself, because in some ways those semi-finals six years ago passed him by. \"The day can be over before it's really begun if you don't concentrate,\" he says. \"That's speaking from my own experiences. I wish I could go back and really enjoy those games instead of just letting them go past me. I would have had a better time. \"They were both quick, over and done with, especially the Chelsea one. To lose 3-0, it seemed all over in half an hour. I don't really remember too much apart from actually losing the game. This one I will try to savour. There are not many chances I will get to play in a semi-final, or a Cup final if we get through.\" Gayle is a very different player from the one he was in his spell at Wimbledon, undergoing a successful transformation this season from striker to centre-back. Plenty of Watford fans had written him off as another expensive, failed Gianluca Vialli signing, particularly after he went 25 league games last term without a goal, but now he is a firm favourite and a key defensive figure. Gayle suggested filling in at centre-half during pre-season and, after some \"teething problems\", has not looked back. \"The fact that I've been a centre-forward has given me benefits in the position,\" he says. \"I know roughly what a centre-forward wants to do.\" The thought of facing James Beattie does not worry him: \"The bigger the guys, the more I'm up for the challenge.\" Gayle has accepted a contract which will keep him at Watford for two more seasons, happy to sign despite having to take a wage cut. \"In the current climate of football I look at myself [as] well blessed with a contract at this stage of my career,\" he explains. \"I want to stay in the game and money didn't come into it.\" Nor, surely, would fashion retailing if he reaches that elusive Cup final on what he has to treat as his last chance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
