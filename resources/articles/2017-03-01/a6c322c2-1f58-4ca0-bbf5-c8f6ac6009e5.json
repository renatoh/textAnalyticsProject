The Ukad head, Nicole Sapstead, told the MPs last week that records seen by her team showed evidence of considerable quantities of triamcinolone being ordered by Freeman. Sapstead said there appeared to be no corresponding clinical need for the volume of the corticosteroid ordered by Freeman, beyond the three injections given \u2013 entirely within the rules \u2013 to Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2011, 2012 and 2013 after his applications for therapeutic use exemptions, although it emerged later that Freeman occasionally treated Great Britain staff members for ailments such as joint inflammation and arthritis. The focus on the jiffy bag, on poor record keeping by Freeman, Sky and British Cycling and on triamcinolone meant Sapstead was not questioned over whether her team had made progress on the allegation by the former Team Sky rider Jonathan Tiernan-Locke that he had been offered tramadol at the 2012 world championships in the Netherlands. The Devon cyclist, who retired recently after serving a two-year doping ban for a biological passport infringement prior to his spell at Sky told the BBC last October that the painkiller had been \u201coffered freely around\u201d. He added: \u201cIt just didn\u2019t sit well with me at the time.\u201d Other British team members present at the world championships and the team\u2019s coach, Rod Ellingworth, have stated that they did not feel there was foundation in what Tiernan-Locke had said. There has been little formal research into the effects of tramadol while racing but doctors are concerned by the possibility that its strong painkilling qualities may compromise safety by reducing awareness, making crashing more likely. According to some sources in France it has addictive qualities and there are cases of cyclists becoming psychologically dependent on it. Cyclists have described taking several pills per race to deaden the pain in their legs and benefit from its slightly euphoric effects. There have been persistent requests for it to be banned, notably from the Mouvement pour le Cyclisme Credible, and from a group of 17 team doctors before the start of last year\u2019s Tour de France. Recently another former Sky member, the Canadian Mike Barry, revealed that he had been sufficiently concerned about the use of the painkiller to raise it with Team Sky doctors. Barry stated that during his time at Sky, between 2010 and 2012, \u201cethically, I really started questioning the use of the tramadol, and the sleeping pills, especially when you see the younger riders using this stuff heavily. If we went into a medical clinic and just asked their GP, they probably wouldn\u2019t give these out. And that is not ethical.\u201d Barry first raised the issue of tramadol in his book Shadows on the Road in 2014, when he admitted he personally had used tramadol at Sky. \u201cI never saw it used in training, only in races, where I saw some Sky riders using it frequently.\u201d He added: \u201cTramadol made me feel euphoric but it\u2019s also hard to focus. It kills the pain in your legs and you can push really hard.\u201d At the time Team Sky responded with a spokesperson: \u201cNone of our riders should ride while using tramadol \u2013 that\u2019s the policy of this team. Team Sky do not give it to riders while racing or training, either as a pre-emptive measure or to manage existing pain. \u201cWe believe that its side-effects, such as dizziness and drowsiness, could cause issues for the safety of all riders. We also feel that, if a rider has the level of severe pain for its appropriate use, they should not be riding. This has been our firm position for the last two seasons and all medical staff and riders are aware of this.\u201d In October 2016 Brailsford told The Cycling Podcast that he was not aware of his riders using tramadol when it was listed by his interlocutor with other substances in the grey area where substances may be legal but can also be performance enhancing. \u201cI have no knowledge whatsoever in any way, shape or form of us systematically using any of those and, if I did, I\u2019d stop it. It\u2019s not what we\u2019re about.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
