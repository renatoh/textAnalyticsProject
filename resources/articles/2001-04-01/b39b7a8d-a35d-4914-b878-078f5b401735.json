If good: comes back, puts boots on and meets the lads in the yard.

This time of year, crabs come inshore. We stay inshore till June. July and August, lobster come in to spawn. My son's boat fishes all year round. I start March and finish September-October. The rest of the year I'm busy making new pots and nets. The nicest bit is getting up in the morning, when there's no wind and the birds are singing. I shove off and I see the sun rising in the sea. In summer, it sets in the sea. I hate autumn. Winter's coming, you never dry out, you wear oilskins all the time, your hands are cold. I love spring - everything's coming green.\" 9.00: Returns to shore. Unloads catch for inspection by fishery officer. 9.45: Returns to yard.

Smelling profit in the dot.com downturn, 12 US menswear firms have launched the Men's Apparel Alliance, a $10m \"awareness-raising\" attempt to bring sharp suits and ties back into the office. Surveys suggest that 47% of senior corporate types support them. \"The fact that a lot of dot.coms have done poorly may make casual attire guilty by association,\" says one major recruiter. The starting point: dress-up Thursdays. Debunker The Selling Safari Folks, it's a jungle out there, and sooner or later you will want to be hunting the tigerfish, right. Never mind the oryx, or the sable. What you want is this fish. It's gold and black and red. And it's got a lot of teeth. It is also a slippery critter and won't be fooled. No, sir. You want a tigerfish, you gotta pursue him on his own terms. But you can take off your thigh-high waders and put away your maggots, for, with a spot of debunking, we find that Alan Buhler, author of The Selling Safari (High Mountain) isn't just talking angling. He's talking sales. \"Prospects are like tigerfish,\" says Buhler, \"As a salesperson you must uncover what will make the prospect bite on your bait.\" He also says that while most salespeople will only consider a customer's \"intellectual\" reasons for \"biting\" we must also think about their emotional reasons. Buhler advises in his Selling Secret number 10 that we must: \"Use the right bait (pain), trawl with questions, then sink your hook into your prospect's personal compelling emotional reason to buy. It takes patience, determination, and tenacity, but the reward will feed your family for a lifetime.\" Our man at the Angling Times tells us that tigerfish are a bit like piranhas. Toothy and ferocious. Perhaps you would be better off sticking to koi carp."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
