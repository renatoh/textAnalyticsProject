The report is published the day after NHS England's medical director, Sir Bruce Keogh, launched plans to reorganise A&amp;Es. He called for far more health problems to be dealt with in the community by NHS 111, GPs, pharmacists and, if necessary, paramedics, leaving emergency medical centres to cope with the most serious and complex cases. NHS 111 was set up to integrate the NHS Direct helpline with ambulance call centres, with the object of offering help to those with less urgent medical problems. But while NHS Direct was largely staffed by trained nurses who could offer medical advice, NHS 111 is staffed by call handlers. They have nurse advisers available, but their primary job is to direct people to the right place. The study, published in the journal BMJ Open, was commissioned by the Department of Health to evaluate the outcomes from the pilot studies of NHS 111 in 2010 in four areas of England: Durham and Darlington, Nottingham, Luton and Lincolnshire. The researchers, from Sheffield University, also looked at what was happening in three other comparable sites that still used NHS Direct. Professor Alicia O'Cathain and colleagues from Sheffield's school of health and related research found that NHS 111 did not reduce the numbers of emergency ambulances called out. Nor did it bring down the numbers of people arriving at A&amp;E or urgent care services. Contrary to expectation, they say, the number of emergency ambulance incidents actually rose by just under 3%. That would translate into 14,500 more call-outs for an ambulance service attending 500,000 incidents a year, they say. NHS England said the study was an evaluation of the pilot projects and that 111 had learned from the experience. \"There is now no evidence that 111 is increasing A&amp;E attendances \u2013 in fact attendances in areas with 111 for the most recent 12 months compared with 12 months earlier is down by 0.2%,\" said a spokesperson. \"Ambulances dispatched from 111 transport the same proportion of patients to hospital as those dispatched by 999 \u2013 showing the service is appropriately sending ambulances. Evidence shows the current NHS 111 service is already becoming a powerful tool to redirect patients from A&amp;E and 999 to less acute services. The patient satisfaction survey shows that 20% of callers would have gone to A&amp;E if 111 were not available. Only 7% of triaged calls are recommended to attend A&amp;E.\" But O'Cathain and colleagues say it is perhaps inevitable that call handlers without medical training will err on the side of caution and send people to seek emergency care. It is sensible to have a single, easily remembered phone number for people to call to get help. But, they say, \"it is probably unrealistic to expect any one service, such as NHS 111, to do everything, and real improvements may only be gained when a series of co-ordinated measures designed to increase efficiency across all services are implemented.\" Andy Burnham, Labour's shadow health secretary, said the staffing of NHS 111 with call handlers was the issue and pointed out that under the Keogh plans, nurses and doctors would be available on the phone.\"It is clear that Cameron's decision to scrap NHS Direct, and replace nurses with call handlers, has added to the pressure on A&amp;E,\" he said. \"It was a major mistake that he now needs to put right. He should implement without delay Bruce Keogh's call for a return to an NHS Direct-style service with clinicians, not computers, making the decisions.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
