Drogba had held talks with Chelsea about returning to Stamford Bridge in a coaching capacity, saying he had a \u201cdesire to help\u201d his former club, who have struggled in the Premier League this season. But on Sunday, he said he was returning for pre-season training with Montreal: Chelsea\u2019s interim manager, Guus Hiddink, also confirmed that Drogba\u2019s immediate future was in MLS, although he did not rule out a move for the Ivorian in the future. \u201cIn the short-term, yes [Drogba will not return],\u201d said Hiddink. \u201cBut in the longer term we talked about players of a big influence or big image for this club, they are welcome. There is no time issue on this. I wish him all the best now for one of his last seasons.\u201d Drogba had a prolific spell at Impact last season, scoring 12 goals in 14 appearances as the team reached the MLS Eastern Conference semi-finals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
