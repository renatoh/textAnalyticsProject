But it was echoed in a Wall Street Journal editorial, and in a New York Times opinion piece that called for an \u201cIraq-style \u2018surge\u2019 to save Mexico\u201d. Previous US efforts to help Mexico fight crime have often been developed without serious diagnosis of the situation on the ground. And even when crime-fighting aid has been designed with care and good intentions, success has been limited. \u201cYou can\u2019t understand US collaboration with a Mexican filter, you have to read it with a Washington filter,\u201d says Javier Oliva, a national security expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. \u201cMexico just isn\u2019t important [to the US] in its own right.\u201d The result has often been US political objectives driving actions in Mexico \u2013 with little thought for the consequences on the ground. When an undercover DEA agent called Kiki Camarena was abducted in Guadalajara and tortured to death in 1985, the Reagan administration came close to shutting down the border, and piled intense pressure on the Mexican authorities to take down the country\u2019s top tier of traffickers. For the US, the crackdown sent a message to the world not to mess with the DEA. In Mexico, meanwhile, it sparked a generational power struggle within the cartels and the emergence of regional organizations that took trafficking to new heights \u2013 and triggered a round of bitter turf wars. When President Felipe Calder\u00f3n took office in 2006 he launched a military-led offensive to control these escalating conflicts. He sought US backing for this strategy, negotiating an agreement called the M\u00e9rida Initiative with George W Bush that was signed in 2007. That deal opened an unprecedented period of bilateral security collaboration \u2013 but it proved no more helpful in bringing cartels to heel than ad hoc US pressure had done before. Under Bush, the M\u00e9rida Initiative channelled military hardware into Calder\u00f3n\u2019s war, prompting a backlash that sent violence spiralling and encouraged cartels to embed themselves ever more deeply into corrupt political and business networks. Then, with Barack Obama in the White House, resources were refocused on an overhaul of Mexico\u2019s abusive criminal justice system. This did make miscarriages of justice slightly less routine \u2013 but it did nothing to ensure more criminals were charged and convicted. \u201cThe main reason the armed conflict in Mexico has become ever more lethal and difficult to control in the last 15 years is impunity,\u201d says Falko Ernst, Mexico analyst with the International Crisis Group. \u201cIt is still more than 95%,\u201d meaning the vast majority of violent crimes go unpunished. The one aspect of US support that has clearly fulfilled its brief has been the pursuit of top narcos under the \u201ckingpin strategy\u201d that was wholeheartedly embraced by Calder\u00f3n and his successor President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who left office last year. Their administrations typically took credit for a constant trickle of high-profile arrests, though DEA involvement was often key. But even the capture and eventual extradition of the man described as the world\u2019s biggest drug dealer \u2013 Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n\u201d \u2013 barely dented the power of organized crime back in Mexico. El Chapo\u2019s own Sinaloa cartel proved itself strong enough to besiege the entire northern city of Culiac\u00e1n last month, forcing soldiers to back down after they briefly detained one of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s sons. Which is why M\u00f3nica Serrano, a security expert from the Colmex thinktank, argues that if Trump really wants to help, his priorities should be \u201cmore enlightened\u201d drug policies that slash cartel profits, and new gun laws that restrict their ability to build up terrifying arsenals. \u201cWithout in any way understating the policy failures in Mexico that have aggravated and exacerbated the situation, the truth is that it is the US that creates the monsters.\u201d she says. \u201cAnd monstrous situations.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
