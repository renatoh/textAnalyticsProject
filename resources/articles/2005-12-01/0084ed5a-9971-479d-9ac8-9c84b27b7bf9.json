The statement coincided with the death of six Sri Lankan soldiers, caused by a landmine in the Jaffna peninsula, the defence ministry said. The military blamed the rebels for the deaths. Earlier, the rebels killed a government soldier near the northern city of Jaffna as troops patrolled the key port city of Trincomalee after at least two residents died in clashes between Muslims and Tamils."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
