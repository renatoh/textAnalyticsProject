The brand had faced a weekend of calls to boycott it after Rishi Sunak, the Conservative MP for the North Yorkshire seat of Richmond, shared the image with the caption: \u201cQuick Budget prep break making tea for the team. Nothing like a good Yorkshire brew.\u201d Many Twitter users responded by condemning the brand, leading the company to stress that it had not endorsed the association. It tweeted later that day: \u201cNothing to do with us \u2013 people of all political stripes like our brew.\u201d However, that message seems not to have been enough to silence detractors, as on Monday the curator of Yorkshire Tea\u2019s Twitter account posted a thread saying they had faced a \u201crough weekend\u201d of angry comments, and calling for a degree of perspective and greater civility online. \u201cOn Friday, the chancellor shared a photo of our tea. Politicians do that sometimes (Jeremy Corbyn did it in 2017),\u201d it said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t asked or involved \u2013 and we said so the same day. Lots of people got angry with us all the same. \u201cFor some, our tea just being drunk by someone they don\u2019t like means it\u2019s forever tainted, and they\u2019ve made sure we know it.\u201d The curator of the account said they had \u201cspent the last three days answering furious accusations and boycott calls\u201d while some people had tried to pull the brand into \u201ca political mudfight\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to be on the receiving end of this as a brand than as an individual,\u201d the thread continued. \u201cThere\u2019s more emotional distance and I\u2019ve had a team to support me when it got a bit much. But for anyone about to vent their rage online, even to a company \u2013 please remember there\u2019s a human on the other end of it, and try to be kind.\u201d The account also thanked those who \u201cspoke up\u201d for them and sent messages of support. Sharing the comments, comedian Mark Watson tweeted: \u201cThis thread, in which Yorkshire Tea politely ask people not to abuse them for a photo they had nothing to do with, made me gesture with vague despair into the void.\u201d The Tory MP for Bishop Auckland, Dehenna Davison, retweeted the thread, calling the whole incident \u201cmad\u201d and imploring people to \u201ccalm down\u201d. The plea for kindness online comes after many people reacted to the death of presenter Caroline Flack by sharing one of her Instagram posts from December in which she implored: \u201cIn a world where you can be anything, be kind.\u201d Thousands took to social media with the hashtag #BeKind in a clamour for change following Flack\u2019s death, pleading with both media organisations and individuals to think more carefully about the impact of their words, especially online."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
