We said we would get Britain out of \u201cever closer union\u201d \u2013 and this deal does that. So we can never be dragged into a European superstate against the wishes of the British people. We said powers must flow back from Brussels \u2013 and we have agreed a new mechanism to return to the UK and other member states those powers that do not need to be exercised in Brussels. We said our UK parliament must have a bigger role \u2013 and we have secured new powers for it to work with other national parliaments to block unwanted EU legislation. We said we would make Europe more competitive \u2013 and this deal helps deliver that. The commission has committed to cut red tape, especially for small- and medium-sized businesses, and will introduce specific targets to reduce the regulatory burden in the most important sectors. The deal also commits the EU to deepen the single market, particularly in the crucial sectors of services, digital and energy, and to press ahead with new trade deals with other large and fast-growing markets around the world. We said we would protect Britain as the eurozone integrates \u2013 and we have done so. The UK will never join the euro and we have ensured that British businesses will not be discriminated against as a result of that decision. And we have achieved a binding confirmation that it will be the Bank of England, not Brussels, that will supervise our financial system, and a guarantee that British taxpayers will not be called on to bail out eurozone member states. And we said we would reduce the attraction of the UK to EU migrants by ending welfare payments to new arrivals \u2013 this deal delivers that. We\u2019ve made sure that new migrants from the EU cannot claim full benefits for four years, and we\u2019ve ensured that child benefit for children living outside the UK can be paid at lower rates, reflecting local circumstances. The package is legally binding and irreversible. At its heart is an international law decision, a type of international treaty that will be registered at the UN. It cannot be amended or revoked unless all member states, including the UK, agree to it. It delivers a strong package for Britain and builds on our existing special status in the EU. We already have opt-outs from the euro, from the open-borders arrangement of Schengen, and from those measures of justice and home affairs that we not want to be part of. This deal tilts the balance firmly in favour of the UK remaining in the EU. We will be stronger, safer and better off in a reformed EU on these terms than we would be out on our own. We will be better off because British businesses will continue to have full access to the single market, and crucially, we will continue to have a seat at the table when the rules are being set. That will safeguard jobs and investment and deliver lower prices and greater financial security for the people of the UK. We will be safer because, when it is in our national interest, we can work with other countries to fight cross-border crime and terrorism, which will enhance our national security in a dangerous world. We will be stronger because we can use the EU as a force multiplier in international diplomacy. We have led the EU in applying sanctions against Russia and Iran. We have led the EU in the battle against Ebola in Africa. And we have been at the forefront of the EU\u2019s efforts to help secure a global climate deal in Paris. The task of reforming Europe does not end with this agreement. But we are the EU\u2019s second-largest economy, and forecast by many to become its largest. We have the ability, the allies and the clout to shape the EU into an organisation that works much more in our interests. And we are resolved to do so. Our special status in Europe gives us the best of both worlds. It means families across the UK get all the benefits of being in the EU, including more jobs, lower prices and greater security. But we are out of the parts of Europe that don\u2019t work for us. We will never join the euro, never be part of eurozone bailouts, or the Schengen no-borders agreement. We will reject any notion of a European army and will never be part of an EU superstate. In contrast, leaving the EU would be a threat to our economic security and our national security. Those who want to leave can\u2019t tell you whether British businesses would be able to access the single market or on what terms. They can\u2019t tell you whether jobs would be safe or if the cost of everyday goods would rise. At a time of uncertainty in the world, leaving the EU would be a huge leap into the dark. Better by far to stay, to bank the benefits of this deal, exploit the special status the UK enjoys, and continue to lead the crusade for further reform in the future."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
