The Chelsea manager\u2019s message was laced with caution on the eve of their return match with La Liga\u2019s champions elect. He talked up Barcelona\u2019s Andr\u00e9s Iniesta as a \u201cgenius with a football\u201d, reminding all that it would take \u201ca perfect game\u201d to knock out \u201cone of the best teams in the world\u201d and warning his own that they must be \u201cprepared to suffer\u201d. The latter phrase has become his motto over recent weeks and it is anything but sabre-rattling. His team appear to have come to Catalonia braced to weather a storm. Yet, behind the scenes there has been an acknowledgment that Chelsea must gamble if they are to make the Champions League quarter-finals. Their approach in the second leg with the score at 1-1 is likely to be bolder than Conte\u2019s rhetoric suggested. In the first leg he had asked Eden Hazard to fill in as a false No 9 and asked Willian and Pedro, a former Bar\u00e7a player, to scurry to the Belgian\u2019s support. Chelsea had soaked up the visitors\u2019 possession and prospered on the counterattack. Hazard may not have been entirely chuffed at the amount of desperate passes flung at his forehead but Chelsea had struck both posts and led for 13 tantalising minutes just after the hour-mark. Had it not been for Andreas Christensen\u2019s rush of blood, their tactics might have secured an advantage to which to cling. Barcelona are a different proposition at home. But this time, and having rather surprisingly suggested he would consult his squad in the buildup \u2013 he had vowed against repeating that after watching a defence rejigged at the players\u2019 request ripped to shreds at Roma in October \u2013 Conte\u2019s plan is set to be tweaked. They have worked with Olivier Giroud as an authentic No 9 in preparations for this second leg. The Frenchman, who has 12 goals in 29 Champions League appearances and whose last involvement in the competition was with Arsenal when they lost 10-2 on aggregate to Bayern Munich a year ago, has impressed in flashes as a Chelsea player. The \u00a318m mid-season addition is likely to start in the middle of the front three flanked by Hazard and the in-form Willian in the hope that what Giroud lacks in pace he may compensate for in an ability to shield passes from deep. Chelsea will need an outlet to relieve the pressure and, the logic goes, the 31-year-old should provide more of a focal point. The alternative had been \u00c1lvaro Morata but the \u00a360m record signing, after such a bright start, is enduring a horrible lull in his first season at Stamford Bridge. The Spaniard, once of Real Madrid and a scorer for Juventus as they succumbed in the 2015 final against Bar\u00e7a, has not registered since Boxing Day and his cameos increasingly betray his frustration. The 18 minutes played against Crystal Palace on Saturday illustrated his anxious state of mind: he was booked after an altercation with James Tomkins, risked further sanction in stoppage time when berating an assistant referee and offered next to nothing in the final third. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, for Morata, this is the first full season in his career,\u201d Conte said. \u201cWith Real Madrid and Juventus he was on the bench, the first substitution if the striker was injured. So, for this reason, we must have great patience. You are talking about an important striker. He has a really important prospect for Chelsea, for the present and the future. I\u2019ve seen great focus and great will to try to fight for a place here.\u201d He may have to demonstrate that off the bench, as Fernando Torres did so gloriously on Chelsea\u2019s last visit to these parts. His stoppage-time equaliser, which put the gloss on the 10-men\u2019s heroic efforts in the 2012 semi-final, established Torres as a cult hero. Morata can aspire to emulate as much. Regardless of the identity of the frontline, Chelsea will need to be more clinical than they were against Palace and calmer in possession than they demonstrated at Manchester City or in the first leg against Bar\u00e7a, if they are to achieve something remarkable. Not that Conte would be satisfied merely to force passage into the quarter-finals, which would emulate his best achievement as a manager in this competition. \u201cI hope, in my career, I consider an achievement to be when I win something,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we are talking about the last 16. We have to make a great game if we want to have a chance to go into the next round but you are never sure with football.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
