Few England forwards, starting a senior international for the first time, can have made such an emphatic impression as his new No 9. \"Today Alan Smith played against a Portugal side who may not have done well in the World Cup but are capable of winning Euro 2004,\" Eriksson said. \"He played against three very strong centre-backs, and he showed that he is ready. He enjoyed it, I'm sure.\" The match was barely into its second minute before Smith challenged Fernando Couto for a 50-50 ball near the right-hand corner flag. Both men slid to the ground in a tangle of limbs but, as the veteran Portuguese captain struggled to his feet, he saw the young striker already moving away, heading along the byline and preparing to cut the ball back towards the incoming Emile Heskey. Several times Smith took the chance to display his hunger for the ball and his natural ability to use it with swiftness and purpose. Just after the hour he played a fine pass out to Trevor Sinclair after turning past an opponent with a strength reminiscent of Kenny Dalglish. Five minutes later he earned the second biggest roar of the afternoon when he won the ball with a sliding tackle on Paulo Ferreira, Couto's replacement, rising to initiate fresh danger in the same movement. This is what is called defending from the front, and Smith noted last week that spectators love it - \"Well, Leeds fans do, anyway,\" he added. Now he knows that the appreciation is not confined to Elland Road. Not within living memory has an England manager been able to call on a forward whose presence is so threatening to opposing defenders when they are in possession. Alas, poor Heskey's giant frame delivers no such threat, although the Liverpool man had a decent game out on the left until Michael Owen's departure brought him back into the central areas. Whatever his virtues, Heskey cannot match the dynamism that Smith adds to the game whenever he gets a sniff of the ball. Smith's goal, taken with a marvellous combination of initiative and technique, was what everyone talked about afterwards but it should be remembered that his scoring header was made possible by a move that defined Eriksson's much derided concept of moving the ball upfield and creating chances as quickly as possible. From the moment the ball left David James's hand, only 15.5 seconds elapsed before it was in the back of Vitor Baia's net. Heskey took three touches to collect James's throw and transfer it infield, Owen took four to make a three-quarter turn and move it across to the right, and Lee Bowyer took two to set up and deliver the cunningly delayed cross that Smith met with a run in front of Fernando Meira. No opponent got a touch as England unfolded a move that would probably have beaten any defence in the world. After the euphoria of Munich a year ago, there was an expectation that Eriksson's team would go on to beat everyone 5-1. As we saw in the World Cup, however, few others will hand out gifts as freely as Germany did that night. And Portugal were more typical of the defences England's forwards will meet during the coming European campaign. They sat deep and asked questions, which made the task significantly harder for Owen, who is struggling to regain his lucidity of thought and action. When Owen is down, Heskey is likely to subside with him. But Smith's natural confidence renders him immune to others' misfortunes, and ensures a point of reference for the team. While it is dangerous to inflict extravagant predictions on young talent, the Leeds man has been around long enough to suggest that his performance on Saturday was no fluke. The experience gained during three years of struggling to establish himself in the Premiership and the Champions League, and of learning to bring his combustible temperament under control, should enable Eriksson to select him alongside Owen without qualms for next month's qualifying ties against Slovakia and Macedonia. Bowyer's display was far less definitive, offering encouragement both to his admirers and his critics. His cross for the goal could not have been bettered by the absent David Beckham, and his Leeds-forged partnership with Danny Mills was reasonably effective. But a late tackle on Simao told a different story, as did the disdainful look he received from Luis Figo after clattering into the back of the great man's legs. Unlike Smith, he still runs around like a hand grenade with the pin removed. To the unfriendly eye, what looks like confidence in Smith looks like cockiness in Bowyer. As for Jonathan Woodgate, the best that can be said is that he is working his way quietly back towards the standard he had reached when he won his first cap under Kevin Keegan, although one fine tackle on Nuno Gomes probably prevented Portugal from taking the lead a minute after they had equalised. Eriksson was again forced to defend himself against those who criticised him for seven second-half substitutions. No one pointed out, on his behalf, that Portugal took control of the second half having taken the field after the interval with no fewer than nine replacements, including the man who assumed control of the game. From his seat in the grandstand, Sir Bobby Robson must have been thrilled by the display of Hugo Viana. Newcastle's 19-year-old midfield prodigy possesses the left foot of Rivaldo, but Agostinho Oliveira gave him the freedom to range across the width of the field, posing a range of problems for England in open play as well as creating havoc with his corner kicks. What England lack, for all Steven Gerrard's virtues, is a player with the skill, imagination, appetite and character to grab hold of a match and run it from the position just behind the strikers. Can Joe Cole do what Viana did? Possibly. But not as long as Eriksson brings him on as a substitute and pushes him out wide on the left, ceding the heart of the action to David Dunn and Danny Murphy - both men with real football brains, and worthy members of the squad, but neither with the spark of genius and arrogance that Cole possesses. There were complaints that the plethora of substitutions deprived the spectators of a true contest. But anyone who did not get value for money from 90 minutes of Smith and 45 of Viana would have been better off doing the weekend shopping."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
