The defensive lynchpin has been out since the end of August during which time City\u2019s rearguard have struggled, conceding 13 more goals than Liverpool. Laporte is back in full training and is hopeful of making a curtailed appearance in the home FA Cup tie against Fulham on Sunday. City\u2019s vulnerability was again exposed when Crystal Palace scored a late equaliser at the Etihad on Saturday. Wilfried Zaha was allowed to run through the defence down the left before forcing a Fernandinho own goal. Guardiola criticised defensive failings after the 2-2 draw but admitted Laporte alone is not the answer. \u201cWe cannot expect Aymeric is going to solve all of the problems,\u201d the manager said. \u201cHe is getting better and the doctor is going to evaluate him and I am going to talk to him about when it will be possible to come back. But after four or five months he will need time, so he will not be ready immediately to do it.\u201d Despite dominating Palace, City struggled to convert chances in a match in which Cenk Tosun\u2019s opener came, like Fernandinho\u2019s own goal, during a rare attack from the visitors. \u201cThey didn\u2019t need much to score,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cWe have to improve. We [will] work on that and be more solid and be more aggressive. At the end all we can do is to try to play and do it and to create chances and concede few. You have to accept one or two actions [against us]. The rest \u2013 we [have to] control it.\u201d Guardiola was impressed with Benjamin Mendy who was a constant attacking threat along City\u2019s left flank. \u201cHe played really good and the final decision in the final third was really good. He had a good game and made good crosses. He plays after [virtually] two seasons injured, so his physical condition is getting better.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
