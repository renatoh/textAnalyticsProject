One glimpse at his achievements over the past 12 months makes very interesting reading. When he took charge of team affairs at Portsmouth a year ago, they were near the bottom of the First Division. Now they are runaway leaders and destined for the Premiership. Admirably this has been done with a transfer outlay of less than \u00a33m. Redknapp has taken advantage of football's financial meltdown and used it to mould a team. And, to top it off, they are playing excellent football. Redknapp, his team's advance briefly slowed with the concession of a late equaliser on Saturday, does not yet know how much he will have to spend when his side make their Premiership preparations. But he has promised those who have got them to this point that they will all be at the club and playing a major role next season. \"If I do sign players they will be additions rather than replacements,\" he said. \"The lads have done a terrific job and they will all deserve to play in the Premiership.\" Redknapp's side started well enough, scoring when the full-back Kevin Harper won the ball in midfield and split the defence open with a through- ball for Steve Stone, whose lay- off was expertly dispatched by Yakubu Aiyegbeni. That looked to be that until Paul McKenna ensured one final twist in this entertaining game by firing home from a set piece in the dying moments. Man of the match: Dickson Etuhu (Preston)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
