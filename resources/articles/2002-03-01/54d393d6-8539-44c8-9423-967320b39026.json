Not for the first time in his 16-year coaching career, the Sheffield United manager finds himself hauled in front of the authorities with plenty of explaining to do; the Battle of Bramall Lane may be over but the war of words rages on. \"I haven't got a problem with the way the referee handled it, and I haven't got a problem with myself and the team,\" said the 54-year-old yesterday in the calm after Saturday's storm. \"My problems are solely with the comments made by [the West Brom manager] Gary Megson. I've never heard another manager go off like he did. I don't know why he had to make those accusations. I take it personally and am very disappointed.\" Three United players were dismissed and another two withdrawn, allegedly injured, forcing the abandonment of the game against West Bromwich Albion with the visitors 3-0 to the good and only eight minutes remaining. Megson suggested Warnock connived to get the game called off. A Football League committee, which will meet on Thursday, is likely to award the points to the visitors. Megson said he had never seen anything like it but Warnock is no stranger to controversy. One former manager described him as \"potty\" and \"not averse to screaming a touchline battle cry of 'break their legs'\", while his post-match outbursts at officials have become the stuff of legend. In January last year he claimed David Elleray \"was that far away he would have needed binoculars\" as United conceded a penalty at Southampton and slipped out of the FA Cup. Despite a promise to donate \u00a375 to charity every time he complained, his midfielder Paul Devlin's dismissal at Wolves earlier this term had him grumbling again. \"Twenty years ago we had the best referees in the world,\" he said. \"Now we have the worst.\" On seeing a video of Devlin's \"tackle\", Warnock apologised, as he did more recently to Sheffield Wednesday after telling a reporter, when asked what he would do if he were in charge of the Owls, that he \"would buy some bad players, get the sack and then retire to Cornwall\". Yet his own brand of gamesmanship has proved effective. Last season, with Blackburn Rovers musing over a bid for his striker Marcus Bent, Warnock fed a line to the local media that Crystal Palace had tabled an offer. That panicked Rovers into completing a \u00a32.1m move. The south Londoners were offered a letter of apology from the United manager while the Bramall Lane board laughed all the way to the bank. Indeed, there are few better managers at mounting a challenge on a shoestring. His sides may be crude and combative, but they have proved effective. A 10-year playing career rarely strayed above the lower divisions before spells managing Gainsborough Trinity and Burton Albion in the Northern Premier League provided the apprenticeship for a record second only to Dave Bassett for the ability to conjure promotion. He lifted Scarborough out of the Conference 15 years ago before leading Notts County's charge from the Third Division to the top flight. There was a fourth elevation in nine years with Huddersfield in 1993 and subsequent promotion with Plymouth before a fall-out with their chairman Dan McCauley over transfer funds. He was sacked by mobile phone. He is unlikely to suffer the same fate this time. \"All a manager can do when something like that happens is act and he did so immediately by telling Santos he's not playing again for us and putting Suffo on the transfer list,\" said the United chairman Derek Dooley. \"What are you going to do, hang him before he's been judged?\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
