Mary had a key role in setting up one of the first access courses in Britain at City and Islington, which enabled students who had returned to education to get the qualifications needed to attain a university place. Her commitment to education also led her to found, in 1999, the first Teaching and Learning Unit in the country, which aimed to help staff develop their teaching skills, bolster training and support student services. In 2004, Mary played an important part in making City and Islington the first further education college in London to be rated \"outstanding\" by Ofsted, leading to its selection as one of 12 \"beacon colleges\" in 2005. She loved her job, particularly the opportunity to give disadvantaged students a second chance. Her service to further education was recognised with her appointment as MBE in 2013, and City and Islington College now has a Mary Rimington cafe. Mary was born in Bramhall, Cheshire, to Richard Rimington, a solicitor, and his wife, Frances, a restaurateur, who had nursed Richard as a wounded soldier during the second world war. Mary went to New Mills grammar school in Derbyshire and won a place at Somerville College, Oxford, where she studied history. After training as a teacher in Cambridge, from 1972 she taught at schools in Hampstead and Highgate, north London, before meeting Reg Smith, who owned a veterinary supplies business. The couple married in 1976. When their three children were young, Mary studied for an MA and MPhil in politics and in 1981 she took up a post as part-time lecturer at what was then City and East London College, later City and Islington College. She worshipped at St Anne's church in Highgate, swam in the open air on Hampstead Heath throughout the year, and loved to visit the Isle of Man, where her parents had retired. She was also a governor of St Andrew's Church of England primary school, Islington. Mary is survived by Reg, by her children Trisha, James and me, and by two grandchildren."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
