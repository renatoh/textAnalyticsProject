I\u2019m Warren Murray \u2013 since I got here before you, let me fill you in. Millions of self-employed people across Britain risk falling through gaps in the coronavirus wage subsidy plan and benefits system, according to the IFS and Resolution Foundation thinktanks. Many earn either too little or too much, or only started working for themselves in the past year, or pay themselves in dividends rather than salary \u2013 all factors that can disqualify them from receiving the assistance. The BBC has reported overnight that British Airways may be preparing to suspend 36,000 staff from duties. The government has admitted that just 2,000 of half a million frontline NHS staff have been tested to date for Covid-19. Strict laboratory protocols and shortages of the required chemicals are part of the problem, and senior researchers have told the Guardian that the UK must find alternatives to speed things up. Boris Johnson has admitted the country needs to \u201cmassively ramp up\u201d the two separate tests that show whether people have, or have had, the disease. It has emerged that a major NHS hospital in London almost ran out of oxygen for its Covid-19 patients on ventilators last week. All NHS trusts in England have been told to carefully work out how many people they can have on ventilators and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines to make sure their supplies do not fail. Security is understood to have been tightened for Dr Anthony Fauci, the 79-year-old infectious disease expert who is the voice of authority at Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus briefings. Despite drawing admiration throughout the US he has received threats and become a public target for rightwing pundits and bloggers who accuse him of undermining the president (there has also apparently been unwanted attention from fervent admirers). Trump meanwhile has admitted the federal US government\u2019s own emergency stockpile of protective equipment is nearly exhausted. States have been scrambling to secure their own supplies. The president has insisted that the US \u201chas to help\u201d the coronavirus-stricken Zaandam and Rotterdam cruise liners that are waiting to enter port in Florida after four people died and dozens more fell sick. The ships\u2019 operators are being required to arrange flights home for international passengers who include Australians, Britons and Canadians. Globally the number of deaths has more than doubled in the past week, according to the WHO. \u201cIn the next few days we will reach one million confirmed cases and 50,000 deaths,\u201d said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO chief. The total number of cases on Thursday was just below 936,000 with more than 47,000 deaths. Here is our latest at-a-glance summary of global coronavirus news and you can find much more throughout the day at our live blog. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Banks dodge bonus ban \u2013 Millions of pounds were paid out to bankers before the Bank of England on Wednesday banned British lenders from making bonus payments to their most senior executives. Banking industry sources said the bulk will have already landed in executives\u2019 accounts, including as recently as last week. Threadneedle Street\u2019s ultimatum for banks to scrap almost \u00a38bn of dividends sent shock waves through the industry, triggering a sharp sell-off in bank shares and causing anger among executives. * * * High sparrow sightings \u2013 The decline of the house sparrow in British gardens appears to be reversing, according to the latest RSPB national garden survey. As well as a rise in house sparrows, the milder winter also brought long-tailed tits, wrens and coal tits to British gardens in huge numbers this year. Nearly half a million people across the country took part in the Big Garden Birdwatch on 25-27 January and counted nearly 8 million birds. The RSPB has run the event for 41 years. The house sparrow was the most counted visitor this winter with nearly 1.3 million sightings over the bird-watching weekend. Since the Big Garden Birdwatch began in 1979 house sparrow numbers have declined by 53% but in the past 10 years their numbers have begun to recover, with a 10% increase in sightings. * * * Now for the weather outdoors \u2013 Tokyo had a rare late-March snowfall on Sunday. The 1cm of snow was the most in 32 years and a contrast to the cherry blossom season which started (without fanfare) in Tokyo on 14 March, the earliest on record. Cold easterly winds across the Italian peninsula have brought spring snowfall to many eastern areas. In the US there have been severe thunderstorms and tornadoes in the midwest with hailstones larger than baseballs and blizzards in Minnesota. Coronavirus extra What might have seemed like OCD concerns a month ago are now very real matters of personal and public health. Zoe Williams asks a virologist and a doctor some of the pressing questions of this strange time: do woolly gloves work? (No \u2013 worse than no!) What do I do if someone comes too close? (Don\u2019t panic \u2013 handle it.) Can I talk to my neighbours over the fence? (Yes but leave a gap, like it\u2019s a demilitarised zone.) Should I call someone out if they\u2019re not behaving safely? (Be reasonable \u2013 don\u2019t shame someone for walking the dog in high heels.) Our Science Weekly podcast team have ramped up their production schedule to produce some more essential listening for these times: today Sarah Boseley speaks to Prof Sonja Rasmussen about how the virus might affect an expectant mother and her unborn child. Data on coronavirus is crucial for scientists, who can use it to replicate and build upon each other\u2019s work. Yet no open data has been published alongside the evidence for the UK government\u2019s coronavirus response, writes Jeni Tennison from the Open Data Institute. \u201cThere is currently no open data available on UK hospitalisation rates; no regional, age or gender breakdown of daily deaths.\u201d Some other countries and private companies are much closer to getting it right, Tennison argues. Today in Focus podcast: On the NHS frontline Laura McClelland, consultant anaesthetist in intensive care at a south Wales hospital, describes being on the frontline of the fight against Covid-19. Lunchtime read: \u2018They try to destroy you\u2019 Mass internment camps did not begin or end with the Nazis. Today they are used everywhere in one form or another, from China\u2019s Xinjiang province where they are used to \u201cpolitically educate\u201d Uighur Muslims, in Syria against the Assad regime\u2019s opponents, and in the US to detain asylum seekers crossing the southern border. How can we stop their spread? Sport Wimbledon has made the belated call to cancel the 2020 event due to the coronavirus pandemic, the first time the tournament has not been held since the second world war. The Premier League and EFL have urged the footballers\u2019 union to accept that players will have to take pay cuts, not just deferral of their wages. Eddie Jones is believed to be on the verge of agreeing a contract extension as England\u2019s head coach through to the next World Cup. The women\u2019s European Championship, which was due to be held in England next summer, has been postponed until 2022, according to the Danish FA. Super League may have to extend the season into next year to fulfil contractual obligations and the Challenge Cup final may have to move from Wembley. Doubts continue to grow around this year\u2019s Tour de France after the UCI announced it was extending the suspension of all cycling races until 1 June. UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov says he won\u2019t leave quarantine in Russia to fight, dealing another blow to UFC president Dana White\u2019s determination to hold UFC 249 in two weeks. And a novel idea is on the table to salvage the NRL season in Australia with a proposal to house all 16 teams, their players and staff at a luxury island resort and play the 2020 season under strict isolation conditions entirely in the state of Queensland. Business Six out of every 10 British companies have no more than three months of cash left, according to the British Chamber of Commerce in a survey that lays bare the financial emergency brought on by the coronavirus . Around 1m small businesses are feared to be at risk of collapsing within the next month. However, the FTSE100 looks like seeing a rise later this morning despite some mixed trade in Asia overnight. Investors are braced for more signs of pain ahead of what is likely to be another record jobless claims figure from the US later today. The pound is on $1.238 and \u20ac1.132. The papers The main front pages can be seen here today. \u201cShambles\u201d says the Mirror\u2019s headline alongside pictures of the latest two health workers to die from the disease \u2013 including retired doctor Alfa Saadu, 68, who was volunteering at the Queen\u2019s Victoria memorial hospital in Welwyn, Hertfordshire. The Mirror has a picture of an empty drive-through testing station in Chessington, Surrey to emphasise its point \u2013 an image also used across the width of the Times\u2019 front page under the headline \u201cVirus testing plans in chaos\u201d. The Mail focuses on the \u201cstatistic that humbles ministers\u201d with the headline \u201c550,000 NHS staff only 2,000 tested\u201d. There\u2019s a similar line on the front of the i \u2013 \u201cNHS frontline staff let down on testing\u201d \u2013 and the Metro \u2013 \u201cRidiculous\u201d. The Guardian has the testing story too but prefers to lead with a different angle: \u201cVirus patients more likely to die may have ventilators taken away\u201d, looking at the potential dilemmas being faced by medical staff. The Telegraph wonders about the testing disaster with the headline \u201cQuestions without answers\u201d over a picture of the business secretary, Alok Sharma, at his Downing Street media briefing. The Express spares the prime minister any direct blame, deflecting fire on to the banks which it says must help the economy in return for 2008: \u201cWe bailed you out now do your duty\u201d. The Sun says \u201cClap of honour\u201d in a clarion call for readers to support Thursday night\u2019s nationwide ovation for NHS staff. The FT reports on the damage to the economy and says \u201cJobless claims rocket by 1m\u201d. The Scotsman is concerned about the economy but chiefly that of Edinburgh: \u201cFestival cancellation will be \u2018catastrophic\u2019 for business\u201d.
