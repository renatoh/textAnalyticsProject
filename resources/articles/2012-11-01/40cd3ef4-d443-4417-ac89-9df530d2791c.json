That they would do so and still be beaten was less so, and must in some respects have been more worrying for Alan Pardew, whose side are now only two points above the relegation zone. Pardew admitted his concern after late goals from Jonathan Walters and Cameron Jerome condemned the club to a fourth consecutive league defeat for the first time since September 2008. Such an outcome had looked unlikely after Papiss Ciss\u00e9 had put Newcastle ahead at the start of the second half, but Pardew insisted his players should take confidence from their effort. \"I thought we were the better side and it's not often you can come to Stoke, say that, and still come away getting beat, but that's the sort of season we're having, we're just not getting any breaks go our way,\" he said, after claiming his side were denied a handball penalty by the referee Howard Webb. \"A couple of mistakes cost us and we didn't make many, so it's tough for us to take, but that was such an improved performance. There was real commitment and balance in the team. The next game [against Wigan on Monday] is an important one, but as long as we keep showing that same level of commitment and enthusiasm we'll be OK.\" Not for the first time this season Pardew mentioned injuries and the additional pressure of the Europa League before insisting those factors should not be used as an excuse. Following a messy and generally disappointing first half, the game came to life shortly after the break when the Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic failed to hold Demba Ba's low shot from around 25 yards and Ciss\u00e9, following up just in case, turned the ball in off the post. The Senegal striker might have scored again, his pace twice taking him clear down the right, but both times Begovic blocked his angled drives. At the other end Newcastle had suffered relatively few alarms when Jerome, brought on as a substitute by Tony Pulis, delivered a fine cross from the right and Walters glanced a header past Tim Krul. Now City had the momentum, and Jerome, perhaps keen to make a point about his lack of opportunities this season, duly made it by being in the right place to turn the ball past the exposed goalkeeper after his fellow substitute Kenwyne Jones won a header. \"When a manager makes changes that work you always wonder why you didn't start with them in the first place,\" said Pulis. \"The effort they put in for the team was there to see and it typifies what we've got at this football club. When we got the equaliser, the belief in the crowd was such I thought we could go on and win. To get to 19 points after 14 games with the fixtures we've had is a great effort.\" The only downside for Stoke was the early injury to Peter Crouch, who will require some serious dental work after losing several teeth in an accidental collision with Fabricio Coloccini."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
