In that year his father, an opponent of the Gaddafi regime, was kidnapped in Cairo, where he was living in exile, and flown back to Libya: \u201cHe was imprisoned and gradually, like salt dissolving in water, was made to vanish.\u201d Matar\u2019s award-winning 2016 memoir, The Return, described how he went back to Libya after more than 25 years to find out what happened to his father. The shadow of that traumatic experience hangs heavy over his new book. Sitting in a vast cemetery just beyond Siena\u2019s city wall, Matar acknowledges that he is \u201cthe mourner without a grave\u201d. He had travelled there ostensibly to view the city\u2019s famous paintings, a trip he had promised himself for many years. But he realises that he is still caught in the turbulent waters stirred up by his previous book: \u201cI had also come to grieve alone, to consider the new terrain and to work out how I might continue from here.\u201d It was at London\u2019s National Gallery that Matar first encountered the paintings of the Sienese school, dating from the 13th to the 15th centuries. When his father was kidnapped, he began visiting the gallery at lunchtimes, spending an hour studying just one painting: \u201cA picture changes as you look at it and changes in ways that are unexpected.\u201d He initially reacted to the symmetrical structure and Christian symbolism of the paintings with bewilderment. And yet over time it was to works such as Duccio\u2019s The Annunciation or The Healing of the Man Born Blind that he kept returning: \u201cThe colours, delicate patterns and suspended drama of these pictures gradually became necessary to me.\u201d In the course of a quarter of a century he has never lost his love for them, finding in the works of the Lorenzetti brothers, Simone Martini and others, an anticipation of later art in which \u201cthe subjective life of the observer is required in order to complete the picture\u201d. A Month in Siena is as much about the city and its people as it is about the famous artworks. Staying in an apartment that was once part of an old palazzo, with frescoed ceilings and perfectly proportioned rooms, Matar writes evocatively of what it is like to live in this beautiful medieval city, with its imposing wall (there not just to repel invaders but to \u201cintensify Siena\u2019s sense of itself\u201d), its labyrinth of narrow passageways (like \u201centering a living organism\u201d), and the vibrant heart of the city, the Piazza del Campo, \u201ca square like no other\u201d. But it is about Siena\u2019s art that Matar writes most movingly. He spends so much time in one gallery every day that the staff bring him a folding chair to use. From Ambrogio Lorenzetti\u2019s frescos in the Palazzo Pubblico to others from the Sienese school in the Pinacoteca museum, the enigmatic paintings prompt wonderfully original riffs on history, time, love and the purpose of art itself: \u201cOnly inside a book or in front of a painting can one truly be let into another\u2019s perspective.\u201d Each day after he visits a gallery, Matar walks to the city wall and back: \u201cIt often felt as though I were tracing the limits of myself.\u201d His stay in Siena becomes a deeply personal exploration of \u201cthe self as city\u201d. For Matar that means coming to terms with the loss of his father and finally acknowledging the painful truth: \u201cI will have to live the rest of my days without ever knowing what happened to my father, how or when he died or where his remains may be\u201d. This slim, beautifully produced book, which includes illustrations of the key paintings, sparkles with brilliant observations on art and architecture, friendship and loss. Matar\u2019s prose is exquisitely measured and precise \u2013 not unlike one of the paintings from the Sienese school that he has admired for so many years. \u2022 A Month in Siena is published by Viking (\u00a312.99).
