Here\u2019s what we learned from a wildly entertaining 4-3 victory: 1. It\u2019s all about the result Despite the friendly nature of the contest, Klinsmann had insisted he was concerned as much with the result as the performance, and that it was time for his charges to make some of the top nations sit up and take notice of America\u2019s potential. \u201cThese are the games where we learn the most,\u201d claimed the German coach, and there was plenty for him \u2013 and future opponents \u2013 to take on board in an even-handed first half that finished 1-1, despite the 69-31% possession advantage to the Dutch. The second period initially yielded a more salutary lesson in the basics of defending and finishing, and all the promise of the opening half evaporated in the space of five minutes shortly after the re-start. But Klinsmann deserves enormous credit for rebuilding from the wreckage of 3-1 down on the fly and his team ultimately showed more clinical poise in front of goal and caused a hesitant Netherlands defence all kinds of problems. Despite being out-shot 27-19 \u2013 a dizzying enough statistic on its own \u2013 the US were never overawed by the team that finished third in last year\u2019s World Cup and fully merited the couple of slices of good fortune off the woodwork that went their way in the closing stages. 2. A striking success Without regular choices Jozy Altidore and Clint Dempsey up front, Klinsmann opted for an adventurous 4-3-3 formation that gave each of Aron Johannsson, Gyasi Zardes and Fabian Johnson a chance to stake a claim. For 33 minutes, it seemed the absent duo had little to fear of losing their places as the rookie attacking trio huffed and puffed, but failed to blow the Dutch house down. But then Johnson served up a delicious right-wing cross and Zardes converted his first international goal with some aplomb. Zardes could have gilded the American lily with an excellent 63rd-minute chance but instead shot straight at the keeper, when a more experiences head like Dempsey\u2019s might have found the inviting spaces to either side. Bobby Wood was then given a chance in place of Johannsson in the final 25 minutes, but it was defender John Brooks who initially showed him the way with a classic counter-attacking goal as the US refused to throw in the towel. A cameo appearance from encouraging college prospect Jordan Morris served notice to an increasingly uncertain Dutch backline, but it was Wood who put the emphatic exclamation point on a stunning comeback, ensuring Klinsmann has plenty of attacking food for thought for this summer\u2019s Gold Cup. 3. A defensive nightmare While the US looked comfortable and creative on the ball, the back four creaked, groaned and were split asunder far too easily on more than half-a-dozen occasions, aside from Klaas-Jan Huntelaar\u2019s two emphatic headers and his deflected shot that went in off Memphis Depay and the post. The American right flank was repeatedly exposed and the centre-back pairing of Brooks and Ventura Alvarado discovered that a moment\u2019s hesitation results in a world-class striker like Huntelaar filling his boots. Things went from bad to worse in the second half as Michael Orozco replaced Alvarado and was immediately victimised for Huntelaar\u2019s second, while yet another cross paved the way for the Dutch third and showed an alarming propensity for Klinsmann\u2019s rearguard to dissolve under pressure from out wide. A hastily-reshuffled back four deserve credit for weathering the storm but there were still far too many alarms for goalkeeper Brad Guzan and, ultimately, the likes of Omar Gonzalez, Matt Besler and Geoff Cameron all improved their prospects of Gold Cup playing time by not being in the environs of the Amsterdam Arena. 4. Re-writing the usual story Much of the narrative since last summer\u2019s World Cup has been on the team\u2019s inability to keep the opposition off the scoreboard in the closing stages \u2013 and a susceptibility to costly late-game collapses. Not in Holland. From 3-1 down after 53 minutes, Klinsmann\u2019s men dominated the final 20 and showed far more intensity and hunger to salvage something from the game, earning the final reward of victory when their swarming approach unhinged a febrile Dutch defence. The recovery hinged on Klinsmann initially looking just to stem the tide of home attacks, bringing on DeAndre Yedlin for Brek Shea and reorganising his back four, with Johnson reverting to left-back. It had the galvanising effect of injecting a more attacking threat down the right flank as Tottenham\u2019s little-used full-back enjoyed far more success as an attacking midfielder, and the US coach \u2013 as well as Mauricio Pochettino back in north London \u2013 will have garnered plenty of food for thought. 5. Replacing Tim The US has used no less than five different goalkeepers since Everton\u2019s Tim Howard announced he was taking a year\u2019s international sabbatical following Brazil last summer. None have staked an overwhelming claim to the position, but Brad Guzan, the presumptive successor to the feted Howard who has been limited to just four appearances in the past 11 internationals, did his prospects no harm in Amsterdam, despite having to pick the ball out of the net three times. The Aston Villa stopper was blameless in any of the Dutch strikes, and actually pulled off a series of impressive saves in the face of what seemed an orange barrage on his goal at times. More importantly, with the likes of Nick Rimando, Bill Hamid and the untried but highly promising Tyler Deric of Houston Dynamo, goalkeeper is a position where Klinsmann has abundant options, and all of them have plenty of upside. In the final analysis, the trip to Amsterdam will have encouraged his hope that he is building an all-round squad with plenty of depth and \u2013 defensive lapses notwithstanding \u2013 he can move on to a showdown against the world champions next Wednesday with some enthusiasm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
