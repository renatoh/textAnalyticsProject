Neale Hanvey was dismissed as the SNP\u2019s candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath last week after he admitted making two \u201cdeeply offensive\u201d antisemitic posts about the financier George Soros and Israel\u2019s policies towards Palestinians. A group of senior SNP officials went to Hanvey\u2019s campaign office in Kirkcaldy last Friday morning to clear out all the party\u2019s campaign materials, cutting off his access to canvassing data. Hanvey is still contesting the seat, as a pro-independence candidate, and has continued to use SNP campaign videos. Hanvey\u2019s refusal to step down has split the SNP and independence movement in Fife, and has blown up into one the most serious disciplinary crises since Nicola Sturgeon became its leader. Because Hanvey was removed after nominations closed, there is no SNP candidate standing in the seat. \u201cIt\u2019s not great; this is a bloody minefield,\u201d said one senior party figure. \u201cBut it\u2019s crystal clear with this or allegations of any type of racism or sexism, that we have to show leadership. We can\u2019t afford not to.\u201d The SNP had been widely expected to take the seat from Labour, two years after losing it to Lesley Laird \u2013 a prominent ally of Jeremy Corbyn, who appointed her shadow Scottish secretary \u2013 by 259 votes. Labour is averaging 18% in the polls in Scotland, putting it on course to lose nearly all the seven seats it won in 2017. Despite offering unreserved apologies last week, Hanvey has since retweeted complaints that the SNP\u2019s deselection decision was unjustified. He told an election hustings in Kirkcaldy on Tuesday he was a victim of \u201ccall-out culture\u201d because he had attacked \u201catrocities\u201d by Israeli troops on Palestinian civilians. His critics claim the SNP and Hanvey should have instead officially endorsed the Scottish Green party\u2019s candidate, Scott Rutherford, to improve the chances of a pro-independence candidate defeating Labour. An experienced pro-independence campaigner and former SNP councillor, who asked not to be named, said the Hanvey case had caused \u201ca vicious fight within the SNP. [The] SNP has thrown away this seat. Lesley Laird\u2019s vote had collapsed and Neale Hanvey was a shoo-in. \u201cThe SNP should have backed the Scottish Green candidate instead and we would\u2019ve beaten Labour.\u201d Other activists claim Hanvey has been victimised because he criticised the campaign by transgender rights groups to be allowed to self-declare and use single-sex facilities. The crisis deepened this week after one of Hanvey\u2019s prominent supporters resigned from the SNP after she was challenged over a tweet where she claimed that describing Israel as a Nazi state could not be defined as antisemitic. The activist, Denise Findlay, had been elected in October to the SNP\u2019s conduct committee which is due to rule on whether Hanvey should continue to be a party member. \u201cThe views she expressed are entirely at odds with the ethos of this party,\u201d an SNP spokesman said. Findlay told the Courier newspaper she was \u201cprofusely sorry\u201d for making remarks hurtful to the Jewish community. Hanvey\u2019s supporters claim he has significant support in the party and in the constituency after he raised \u00a36,150 in campaign donations in three days from 215 donors. Jim McIntosh, 56, a pro-independence activist staffing Hanvey\u2019s campaign office, said local people had said \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d to them about the antisemitism controversy since it came to light last week. Their primary concern was NHS funding, McIntosh said. He was sure Hanvey would win. \u201cI know the town and I know the people.\u201d There has been \u201cnothing but support for him from these constituents.\u201d Rutherford said: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that some people in the pro-independence movement haven\u2019t coalesced behind us. We\u2019re the only pro-independence party standing now in Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
