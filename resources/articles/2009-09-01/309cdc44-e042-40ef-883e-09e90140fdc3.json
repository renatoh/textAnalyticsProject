But next time you are in the supermarket, take a closer look at the blocks of cheddar: an increasing proportion of the hard yellow cheese, which has been produced in England since at least 1170, does not come from within the British Isles. Figures from DairyCo, the body that campaigns for the UK's dairy industry, reveal that between January and June we imported 62,003 tonnes of cheddar compared with 48,633 tonnes in the same period last year. And even cheddar labelled \"packaged in Britain\" is not the domestic product patriotic consumers may have been led to believe. It is likely to have been imported from southern Ireland but, thanks to a legal loophole, given a \"British\" credit because it has been wrapped in Britain. So why is Britain now importing so much of a cheese that it gave to the world? The answers are complex, but they can be boiled down to two words, now the subject of furious farmers' protests around the globe: milk prices. While the economics behind the price of a pint may seem of interest only to listeners of Farming Today, they go to the heart of Britain's food security programme and so have a direct impact on us all. For almost a decade, falling milk prices have seen dairy farmers complain bitterly of squeezed profits. Little attention has been paid to them, but now the aggressive buying tactics employed by major supermarket chains have prompted many smaller dairy farmers to leave the industry, claiming they cannot turn a profit from their cows, and there are renewed calls for the government to step in to save the industry. The Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers (RABDF) says the number of dairy farmers in the UK has halved in a decade to 17,060, and farmers are still quitting at an average rate of 14 a week. This downward trend was bucked, briefly, in 2007 when global milk prices soared as the world economy boomed and countries such as India and China saw a surge in demand for all things dairy. Irish farmers in particular took advantage of rising milk prices to boost production, bringing a boom in cheddar production, much of which went into storage. Then, as the recession took hold, demand dried up and global milk prices resumed their downward trajectory. Today the best price Britain's dairy farmers can expect for their milk is just under 22.5p a litre, down more than 20% from the 13-year high of 27.3p achieved last October. The decline may not seem much but, given the soaring costs of fuel and food for cattle, it means that most UK dairy farmers are now selling their milk at a loss. While some hope to ride out the recession, others have not been so fortunate. In June the Dairy Farmers of Britain co-operative collapsed, owing \u00a359m to its bankers. A report by its receivers, PricewaterhouseCoopers, blamed a flawed business plan, poor management and bad decision-making, all of which were brutally exposed when plunging milk prices hit home. At one stage the co-op was forced into a fire sale of its cheese at \u00a3500 per tonne below its market value. More than 600 jobs were lost. Small wonder, then, that milk production in the UK is dwindling. Today the industry is producing 12.5bn litres a year \u2013 1.5bn less than two years ago, its maximum quota agreed with the EU. As production has fallen, and cheaper milk \u2013 and cheese \u2013 becomes available from abroad, the UK has found itself consuming not just vast amounts of foreign cheddar but a million litres of milk from Europe each day, according to the RABDF. It is unlikely that our embattled dairy farmers will want to increase production in the short term. In a globalised market, where dairy farmers from the US to Russia are currently making losses, there remains severe deflationary pressure on milk prices. Groups representing European milk farmers claim that world prices have sunk so much they are now having to sell milk at half their production costs, leaving more and more of their members unable to pay their bills. The mood is turning sour. Last week 300 tractors dragged milk containers over fields in southern Belgium, dumping a day's worth of production. Similar protests were made in Germany, France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The crisis has driven many EU farmers into a \"milk strike\", with thousands refusing to deliver to the industrial dairy conglomerates that produce everything from skimmed milk to processed cheese. Romuald Schaber, president of the European Milk Board farmers' group, said that up to half the milk-farmers in some areas are refusing to deliver, and predicted that the first shortages could hit some supermarkets on the continent as early as this week. \"We are looking at a real catastrophe,\" he said. \"Nobody can produce milk at these prices.\" Will milk shortages on the Continent have an impact on the UK's supplies? \"When you look at the level of milk production we've got now, compared with five years ago, that makes it look more likely,\" said one senior dairy industry source. Worryingly, the autumn is a time when milk yields from dairy herds drop, placing further constraints on supply. But such concerns may be dwarfed in the longer term as the dairy industry fails to attract a new generation of farmers. Research conducted by the RABDF found the average age of a British dairy farmer is 49, while a typical herdsman was 42. Few currently in dairy farming knew of anyone aged under 25 who wants a career in their industry. The findings raise questions about what happens when the current generation retires or simply walks away en masse. There are warnings that Britain will continue increasing the amount of cheese and milk it imports unless dairy farmers here get a better price for their milk and have an incentive to start producing more. The RABDF wants a pledge from supermarkets and cheese producers to source more milk and dairy products from within Britain in a bid to guarantee the long-term future of the industry. Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer are two of the big chains that have taken some positive steps, according to the RABDF, but it believes much more could be done by all the major players \u2013 and the government. Cheddar is likely to be at the forefront of the battle. \"This business of importing cheese in blocks and then repackaging it as 'British' has got to change,\" said Lyndon Edwards, chair of the RABDF. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has promised it will look into the issue, but the association's wider hope \u2013 that the supermarkets and big dairy distributors will opt to buy British \u2013 may be a forlorn one in a cut-throat retail environment. Edwards said he was puzzled by Defra's stance on securing the future of dairy, given the government's new focus on sustainability. \"People are going out of business, and in the last 10 years 50% of dairy farmers have quit,\" he said. \"Defra talk about food security in one breath but say something else in another.\" Yet for all the despondency in the dairy sector, almost all involved agree that it would be quite wrong to pen its obituary now. Dairy UK, the trade body that represents milk processors and distributors, said it was \"cautiously optimistic\" about prospects. Even Edwards expresses hope. \"If you've been in this business for this long, then you've got to be an optimist,\" he said. They believe a phased liberalisation of EU milk production \u2013 due to come into full force in 2015 \u2013 should help the UK's dairy farmers. Germany, for example, is allowed under the EU quota system to produce some 25bn litres of milk a year \u2013 twice what the UK is currently producing. When this system is finally dismantled, the argument runs, the gloves will come off and Britain's redoubtable dairy farmers can take on their foreign counterparts on a level playing field for the first time. \"The UK is one of the most competitive and efficient milk producers in the EU,\" said Helen Eustace, an economist with DairyCo. All the available data suggests that global demand for milk can only increase, she believes. \"That's why competitive British dairy farmers should be confident that average prices will, in the medium \u2013 and long \u2013 term, return profits.\" If they can just hold on until then\u2026"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
