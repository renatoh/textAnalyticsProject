Singer and pianist Amanda Palmer still plays a goth Sally Bowles - her voice bold and brittle, her words unsentimental - but, together with drummer Brian Viglione, she has moved away from the Weimar Republic feel of the duo's 2004 debut and embraced pop. The catchy attack of Backstabber culminates in wicked laughter, and the speeding piano and snapping drums of Necessary Evil play on the band's punk and new wave tendencies. But Palmer's style is overwhelming: she sings her poetry with such gusto that it crosses from enthusiastic drama to verbose pantomime. It's when she holds back, as on Me and the Minibar and the chilling First Orgasm, that the Dresden Dolls transcend boundaries rather than tearing through them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
