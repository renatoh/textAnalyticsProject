Born in Durham, he identified with that city throughout his life. His education was interrupted by a severe bout of rheumatic fever (untreatable by antibiotics in those days). Like many of his generation, he was obliged to leave school at the age of 16 - in his case, to serve an engineering apprenticeship - but he never really took to this and was soon to enrol on a diploma in youth work at Durham University. When war came, his heart problem meant that he was not eligible to fight, but he joined the Home Guard. Youth club work became his life. In the early 1950s, he was leader of the Pedro Street Settlement youth club in Hackney (a tough, socially deprived area, recently featured in the TV series The Secret Millionaire). He moved on to become organising secretary for the Northumberland Association of Youth Clubs, and from there to the national association in London. He was the author of two books: Know the Game: Five-a-Side Football, and A Time to Play. In 1981, he was offered the MBE for services to youth work, but decided not to accept the honour due to his dislike of patronage. His success came from his sincerity and friendliness; he was difficult to dislike. He retired at the age of 60 and spent 20 happy years in Llantwit Major, south Wales. He and his wife, Ella, remained active members of the Labour party and the CND. They were also keen members of the Ramblers Association, and shared a love of music. Wilf, a lifelong supporter of Sunderland football club, became chairman of Llantwit Major FC, a position he was very proud to hold. In their 80s, Wilf and Ella moved to Oxford to be near their eldest daughter, Judith. He considered himself lucky: he said, on his 80th birthday, that he had never expected his heart to last so long. Always proud of his family, he leaves Ella, his five children, 12 grandchildren and 9 great-grandchildren."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
