Generally though Clarke's approach to pre and post-match chat is a bit like his batting: nuanced, light of touch and \u2013 as whitewash-bound Australian captains go \u2013 unusually delicate. With this in mind it was striking that Clarke chose to criticise directly England's selection for the fourth Test defeat at the Melbourne Cricket Ground during preparations for the series finale. \"The one player I think England missed in that last game was Matt Prior, for his leadership and experience,\" Clarke said after pre-match practice at Sydney Cricket Ground. \"I think he's a similar person to Brad Haddin and I think one of the best things that's happened to our team is having Brad back because of his experience, because of his leadership, because of his toughness. \"That's certainly not having a crack at Jonny Bairstow, he's a wonderful talent and has a huge future for England. But I think when you're not performing as well as you'd like as a team that a tough-nosed senior player helps the group a lot.\" If Australia's players have a healthy respect for England's cricketer of the year, who averaged 40 in Ashes series before his travails of the last six months, Clarke's comments raise some questions. In absentia, Prior had his best Test match for some time in Melbourne as the batting continued to splinter and Bairstow's hesitant performance highlighted the difficulties of keeping wicket in a tired and struggling team. There is a view that England's selectors have effectively salvaged Prior's medium term international career by dropping him now, heading off any further unravelling of his form and teeing up a recuperative six months before a busy international summer at home. Certainly there were plenty of candidates for the ejector seat after the capitulation in Perth. Clarke's support was no doubt intended as a gentle pointer towards the sheer, induced muddle-headedness of the opposition, but it also emphasises a creeping sense that Prior might be back sooner rather than later. \"I mean 60-odd Test matches, [he] averages 40 as a wicketkeeper,\" Clarke said. \"I think he's done some amazing things to help England get to where they are today. It's tough when you're not winning and the way cricket goes, players always get dropped. But if you ask me Matty Prior is somebody I'd get back in the starting XI asap.\" Prior is helped by the fact he is unencumbered by obvious successors. Jos Buttler is a compelling talent with the bat, but only an occasional keeper. Craig Keiswetter has dropped out of favour. Ben Foakes is in favour but had a poor season with the bat for Essex last year. England will play at least 18 limited overs matches before their next Test against Sri Lanka in May. A good performance by Bairstowwith gloves and bat in Sydney would start an extended period of open audition for a role Prior has held unchallenged for five years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
