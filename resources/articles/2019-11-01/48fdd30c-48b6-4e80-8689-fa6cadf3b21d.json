Tammy Abraham\u2019s goalscoring exploits have left both strikers in the shade this season, hurting their chances of representing their countries at Euro 2020. Roberto Mart\u00ednez said during the last international break that Batshuayi needed to play more for Chelsea and the Belgium manager\u2019s France counterpart, Didier Deschamps, has complained about Giroud\u2019s lack of games. However, Lampard dismissed suggestions that he is under pressure from Mart\u00ednez and Deschamps, even though Giroud has hinted he could push for a transfer in January to cement his place in the France squad. \u201cNot at all,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager said. \u201cIt is difficult for me and it is difficult for them. We both have our jobs, so it doesn\u2019t feature in my thinking. I have to care for all the players. I have to pick the squad as I see it for the best of Chelsea, as they do for their countries.\u201d Giroud has not started a league game since August and was an unused substitute when Chelsea were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Manchester United on Wednesday. Lampard is happy to talk to the 33-year-old about his future in January but wants the former Arsenal forward to stay. Batshuayi has done well recently, coming off the bench to grab Chelsea\u2019s winner against Ajax in the Champions League last month and scoring a fine goal when he started against United. However the 26-year-old is likely to be replaced by Abraham when Chelsea visit Watford on Saturday evening. N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, who has a 50-50 chance of being involved when Lampard\u2019s side host Ajax on Tuesday, has not recovered from a groin injury for the trip to Vicarage Road. If Kant\u00e9 is fit, Lampard will not ask Deschamps not to pick the midfielder for France\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifiers against Albania and Moldova this month. \u201cI love players playing for their countries,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cIt means they are playing well for us. If he is fit and playing for us, then I will happily wave him away and hope he comes back in good health.\u201d Antonio R\u00fcdiger will not return against Watford. The German defender trained this week but will see a specialist on Monday to discuss a problem in his pelvic area."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
