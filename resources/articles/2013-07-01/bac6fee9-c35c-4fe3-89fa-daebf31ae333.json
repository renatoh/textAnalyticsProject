Composed between 2006 and 2009, it is played with superb commitment and verve by pianist Claire D\u00e9sert and the members of the Trio Wanderer. The centrepiece is a work for solo piano, Suonare, whose flamboyant virtuoso writing suggests that of all Mantovani's 20th-century French predecessors, it may be Ravel who left the biggest mark on his style. It's revealing that the disc also includes D'Une Seule Voix, for the rare combination of violin and cello, instruments for which Ravel composed one of his most uncompromising works. Mantovani's writing for the two instruments also recalls the tour de force of George Benjamin's duo, Viola Viola, but as in all the pieces here, the energy and assurance are Mantovani's own. All'Ungarese, a violin-and-piano piece indebted to Bart\u00f3k's second violin sonata, also generates intensity, while in the homages to Schubert in the Huit Moments Musicaux for piano trio and Paul Klee in the little piece for cello and piano, the energy is precisely focused, its effect carefully calibrated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
