That his ability and commitment to football was matched only by his inability to control his temper. He is a hero to schoolboys, we are told. Well of course he is. What better role model for an adolescent than to see someone who shouts, screams and rants at all who don't conform to his view of how things should be, and not only gets away with it but is lauded for it. 'I get like that sometimes,' says Roy of his initial row with Packie Bonner. It's an interesting statement, both acknowledging his ill behaviour, and implying that it won't be the last time either. In any walk of life, such an attitude is prone to blow up in your face one day. As for Mick McCarthy, a public airing of grievances rarely works well. It is designed by managers to intimidate workers into backing down, embarrassed to make a fuss in front of colleagues. It backfired spectacularly, I don't think McCarthy 'engineered' Keane's departure, I doubt he has the nous. It was just poor management, and a bad idea - what kind of an eejit backs an already bellicose Roy Keane into a corner? Roy has not been managed well, and not just by his country, but primarily by his club, whose own manager's truculence serves as a poor example. Kevin Mitchell's proposition for Roy to take over from Ferguson may be the best hope Roy has for the future. Believing that you're right about everything may work well for life inside Old Trafford, it's poor preparation for life outside it, where all but the luckiest must go. Roy Keane is 31 and it's about time he grew up. Brendan Dempsey via email Roy Keane is a grown man, who, whatever his concerns, has acted like a spoilt child. Rather than 'problem-solve' a difficult situation, he throws a tantrum. Yet according to your newpaper, we have to admire his fighting spirit and combative nature. Why? Whatever the rights and wrongs of the training facilities, attitude of his team-mates and manager, Keane's response was immature and far from being something to admire. It is very doubtful that Ireland will ever progress very far in the World Cup ,yet somehow this is a sort of justification for Keane's behaviour - he apparently finds it difficult to cope with not being a winner. Well what a shame! A will to win is one thing, the bleating of man who is not getting his own way is another. Keane has much to offer as a player but as man he has shown himself to be the impulsive, reckless and thoughtless man many saw him to be. L McDonald Manchester With regard to the article on the Roy Keane affair, 'A nation disowns its hero' ( Observer Sport Irish edition, 26 May) the headline was misleading. In a number of polls, a large proportion of people (70 per cent, 80 per cent and in one case 90 per cent) said they felt Mick McCarthy was wrong to send Keane home. These polls were run by RTE, The Irish Times and Today FM . The content of the article was also misleading: for example, 'Keane is now viewed by many in Ireland as public enemy number one.' In general, it would seem that people are far more angered at the (mis)management of the FAI, and in particular McCarthy's lack of sensitivity and nous in asking Keane to explain his feelings in front of the Irish squad. Lisa Godson Dublin We all know why 'crap player' and 'crap manager' Mick McCarthy got so many caps for Ireland: another English c*** was picking the team at the time. Brian Sheridan Sheffield As a Liverpool fan, I have had to put up with tabloid journalists criticising Emile Heskey for the past two years. This has not been a problem, as I do not see these people as credible commentators, but I am dismayed to see an Observer reporter jumping on the bandwagon (Paul Wilson, 26 May). Since Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson took charge of the England team, many midfield players have been tried on the left, including Trevor Sinclair, Joe Cole, Owen Hargreaves and Nick Barmby and, as the least natural option, Heskey has performed as well as any of them and deserves great credit for that. Unfortunately, the press do not appreciate anything about a forward player except his goal record, even if he isn't playing up front. This is a disappointing attitude and I now feel compelled to defend Heskey. Any Liverpool fan (and I mean the people who make the effort to visit Anfield, rather than the glory-hunters who make fools of themselves on 6-0-6 every week) will tell you how valuable Heskey's contribution to the team is - this includes his hold-up play (which Wilson criticises) and his defensive qualities, as well as his offensive efforts. Also, Michael Owen will tell you how much easier his life is when he is partnered by Heskey. In the recent past, Heskey has been afforded high praise by Fabio Cappello, Patrick Kluivert, Frank de Boer and Thierry Henry - in addition, of course, to his club and international managers. He will not let England down in any position in the World Cup. Instead of disrespectful attacks on an undeserving target, maybe English football journalists should be asking why England's defenders seem incapable of playing to an acceptable standard in their first choice positions.
