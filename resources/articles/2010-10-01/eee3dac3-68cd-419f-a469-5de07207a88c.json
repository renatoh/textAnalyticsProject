Things went for a song in those days when much Victoriana was treated with contempt. The gigantic, half-ton pianola and associated assortment of paper rolls that they bought then turned me into a juvenile cross between Solomon and Semprini! Another such mechanico-manual instrument used to be a key attraction at a country inn overlooking the long-gone Buxton-to-Ashbourne railway. This one, though, required coins to be fed into it before a raucous medley poured forth that could have put Winifred Atwell to shame. Like the nearby railway, this pianola has long since disappeared, but I can still imagine the echoing cadences on a summer evening as dairy cows grazed nearby, unmoved by the drifting smoke from a passing train. It reminds me, too, of a summer Sunday afternoon when I heard the distant notes of a brass band on a remote hillside. Where could such a gathering be secreted? A large band in such a place seemed quite bizarre. Eventually I espied the distant figure of a farmer's son carrying a battery radio \u2013 he was sharing his hours of freedom with all the world in the days before iPods and earpieces."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
