Hugh Morris, the managing director of England cricket, is to make a statement to the hastily convened media. Despite no official confirmation, what previously seemed unthinkable now seems all too possible \u2013 that Strauss, one of the most successful captains in England's recent history, after winning Ashes series at home and away, has decided to step down. Giles Clarke, the England and Wales Cricket Board chairman, will then hold a further press conference at Derbyshire's County Ground during their championship match against Essex. Alastair Cook, England's one-day captain and Strauss's fellow opener, is likely to assume the Test captaincy. The England and Wales Cricket Board called the conference at 10.18pm, when the dust was still settling on another nightmare day in the Pietersen saga, at least from their point of view \u2013 as England were dumped from the top of the world one-day rankings after a crushing defeat by South Africa in Southampton, led by Hashim Amla's superb 150. It was hours after the absent rebel Pietersen had struck a superb century for Surrey in a County Championship match in Somerset. That inevitably prompted further debate over the rights and wrongs of Pietersen's continued omission, but it may turn out that the late and mysterious withdrawal of Strauss from Middlesex's Championship game in Worcester was much more significant. England's Test captain had declared his intention to play in that game, in an effort to rebuild his confidence after a lean series against South Africa, at the press conference he conducted in the immediate aftermath of the third Test defeat at Lord's last week. Then on Monday night, it emerged that Strauss would not be playing at Worcester after all, with the ECB saying only that he was not yet ready to return. He is understood to have held talks with senior ECB officials at Lord's during the day on Monday, with no apparent urgency to begin the face-to-face discussions with Pietersen which both Strauss and the team director Andy Flower have said are a necessary first step to the pair playing together again in the same England team. The row which broke after the text messages Pietersen sent about Strauss to members of the South Africa team, but concerns wider issues than his relationship with the Test captain, has already cost England the services of a key player for that third Test at Lord's \u2013 when they were displaced from the top of the world five-day rankings. He has also been omitted both from the current one-day series against the Proteas, which continues at The Oval on Friday, and from the squad for England's defence of the world Twenty20 title in Sri Lanka next month. Time is also running out before the England selectors and the ECB management must agree on which players are to be offered central contracts for the next 12 months, with Flower suggesting last week that those decisions \u2013 in addition to the selection of the squad for a four-Test tour of India later in the autumn \u2013 would have to be made before the t20 team leave for Sri Lanka on 13 September. As things stand, that India tour is due to be Strauss's next international commitment, as the 50-over team is now captained by Alastair Cook, and Stuart Broad will lead the defence of the world t20 title."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
