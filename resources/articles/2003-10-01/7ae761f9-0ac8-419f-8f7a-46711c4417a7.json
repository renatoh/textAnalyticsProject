Despite good rain in west Yorkshire at the weekend Nicky Henderson, the trainer of last year's winner Marlborough, will be hoping for more if his 11-year-old is to have a chance to double up in the race, which with \u00a360,000 in added prize money will be the richest ever run at Wetherby. The sponsors of the Charlie Hall, the online bookmakers bet365, have put up an enticing \u00a375,000 bonus package for the race, just an extended furlong short of the three miles and one furlong distance of the Gold Cup. If Saturday's winner goes on to take the Cheltenham title in March there will be \u00a360,000 extra to the owner, \u00a310,000 to the trainer and \u00a35,000 to staff from the successful stable. Unfortunately fears over the lively going mean that one eyecatching prospect from last year's Festival, Truckers Tavern, will miss the race. Ferdy Murphy's bold eight-year-old chestnut, who is expected to prove one of the main challengers to Best Mate's crown, is following a strategically planned route to the Festival highlight next spring. \"No detail will be ignored or left out,\" declares Murphy, who is determined to give his charge every chance to step up on his fine display last March when he was 10 lengths runner-up to Best Mate. Truckers Tavern would clearly have been closer then but for a mistake three fences from home. \"This time everything has got to be right, and with bright sunshine and a drying wind up here in the north at present I wouldn't risk him - a horse of his potential,\" explained Murphy, who is based in Leyburn, north Yorkshire. \"We took a chance a couple of times last year on fastish going and that won't happen again.\" Instead, he hopes to send his star over to Down Royal in his native Ireland on Saturday week for a crack at the James Nicholson Chase. Murphy added: \"Truckers has a school on Saturday and Sunday mornings and he's a lot sharper and shrewder than he was. Remember, he has only had 12 runs in his life. On the face of it he is vastly inexperienced, but I think that run in the Gold Cup last year did him the world of good. \"Now we just want to get more experience into him, and his jockey Davy Russell, at the top level.\" Murphy has opted not to appeal against an \u00a3800 fine he received at Fakenham on Friday over the running and riding of Chancers Dante, who finished tailed off in the Geoff Hubbard Novice Chase. Russell will also accept his five-day ban from the incident. Murphy waxes lyrical about his jockey, saying: \"He rides like Paul Carberry does and how Adrian Maguire used to do for me - he squeezes and squeezes.\" Marlborough, to be ridden by his regular jockey Mick Fitzgerald, provided one of the early spectacles of the season in last year's Charlie Hall by recovering from a blunder to beat Hussard Collonges and Gingembre. His trainer Henderson said: \"It is forecast to rain and we hope it will. Mick was pleased with him when he had a workout on the Flat course at Newbury on Sunday.\" The Wetherby course chief executive Tim Betteridge is watering like mad for his big day, which also boasts the Grade 2 John Smith Hurdle. The chases scheduled at the track's opening day of this season had to be abandoned because of ground conditions, but Betteridge reported yesterday: \"We had 6mm (in) of rain on Saturday night and we have been watering 22 hours a day since. At present it is on the easier side of good to firm.\" Trainer Paul Nicholls will be happy to see the race go ahead on decent going as he already announced as a likely runner his Valley Henry, who was fourth in the Gold Cup last year. The rest of the acceptors are: Alcapone, Gingle Jinks, Spendid, Ballybough Rasher, Chives, Sleeping Night, Telemoss, Barrow Drive. Tony Dobbin, who fell badly from Chevalier Errant at Aintree on Sunday, returns to the saddle at Sedgefield tomorrow, where he aims to improve on his score of 37 winners for the season so far. The Irish apprentice Sean Cleary remained critically ill with severe head injuries at Dublin's Beaumont hospital following a fall at Galway on Sunday. Another Irish apprentice, Helen Keohane, was detained in hospital and stood down for 21 days after being knocked unconscious when unshipped on the way to the start by Mikes Baby at Leopardstown yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
