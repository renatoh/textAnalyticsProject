It was a documentary about Lance Armstrong\u2019s fall from grace, itself precipitated by his cuckoo comeback Tour in 2009, aged 37. The film invited anyone who\u2019d invested in Armstrong\u2019s fiction to look into his eyes and try to assess his level of sociopathy. Off the chain? Or more of a four? Yet somehow answers remained out of reach. It was a strange, baggy, unresolved movie. Gibney\u2019s own sense of betrayal blocked the bigger picture. Plus, of course, you can eyeball someone all you like, but you still won\u2019t be able to actually tell what they\u2019re thinking. Step in fiction. Stephen Frears\u2019s movie isn\u2019t a straight remake of the documentary whose territory it shares, as is the case for an unusual number of Tiff titles this year. It\u2019s an adaptation of David Walsh\u2019s doping expos\u00e9, for which the Sunday Times journalist was, at the time, hauled over the coals. But unlike, say, Truth - a movie of Mary Mapes\u2019s memoir about being dumped by CBS for a story she, too, struggled to prove - it doesn\u2019t waste energy on endless vindication. Rather, it grants you access to those moments that fact cannot. It lets you see what Armstrong so brilliantly hid: the injections and the back-stabs, the bullying and the blood bags, the creeping belief in his own lies. And it\u2019s this rationalisation that somehow makes such a singular story relatable. Ben Foster plays Armstrong: a rare case of the actor being less attractive than the subject. He does it brilliantly: pumping himself up into a coiled muscle of rage which exhibits as swagger. Yes, he\u2019s affected by that near-fatal testicular tumour at 21, but he starts out as a nasty piece of work, too, simply getting worse as his success seems to necessitate. His pusher is Michele Ferrari (Guillaume Canet), an Italian physician genuinely excited by the chemistry, his foil is Walsh (Chris O\u2019Dowd, very good and guileless), who worries at his heels, to no-one\u2019s ease. We watch as the journalist is shunned by the rest of the reporting pack after confronting Armstrong. How his colleagues side with the celeb, star-struck and self-interested, despite knowing he\u2019s suspect. Such dishonour is nicely counterpointed with the comradeship between cyclists, even clean rivals keeping silent. Except, of course, for Floyd Landis, who finally spills on his own use of EPO after he\u2019s caught, and then on everyone else\u2019s after Armstrong daftly shuns him as soiled goods. As Landis, Jesse Plemons leaves a distinct impression, and the script serves him well. The story of the Mormon hung out to dry was not something Gibney\u2019s film got round to. The Program is flawed. There are frequent flashbacks to events already seen which contradict Armstrong\u2019s narrative \u2013 just in case we hadn\u2019t twigged he was fibbing. Music cues can feel a bit on-the-button (\u2018Everybody Knows\u2019 over the end credits, when everybody knows), and Dustin Hoffman\u2019s splashy cameo distracts. But it\u2019s a fluid and nippy telling of a tale that still seems strangely urgent. Superfluous details never slow things down (Armstrong meets and marries his wife in 30 seconds flat; she then disappears). And Frears finally decides to be merciless about his subject, happy to allow the audience to abandon sympathy. Where his film excels is in examining how it feels to be unable to accept defeat, even when you know victory was ill-gained. And in pulling no punches in pointing the finger at us, the gullible public, dumbly unable to reject an irresistible narrative. The clues were there all along, The Program reminds us. We just dug in our heels and presumed innocence, even though we knew it was too good to be true, despite having heard him tell us \u201cwe\u2019re all the own authors of our own life story\u201d and we should \u201cgo out there and write the best damn story you can\u201d. The best place to hide is right out in front, in plain sight, in yellow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
