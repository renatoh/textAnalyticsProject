The quilts have since been used on a set of American stamps and a series of them will travel to the UK for the first time next year for an exhibition showcasing art and artists from America\u2019s deep south. The gallery Turner Contemporary in Margate announced details of a show that will shine light on work made by people as they lived through America\u2019s civil rights struggles, often in conditions of utter poverty. \u201cThis work is not well known at all in the UK and has been very rarely seen,\u201d said Sarah Martin, head of exhibitions at Turner Contemporary. \u201cMost of these artists and makers have not been exhibited in the UK or Europe at all. \u201cIn the US the work that is in significant collections has always been bracketed or shown in the context of \u2018craft\u2019 or \u2018outsider art\u2019. That is changing, but it has been collected and shown in that camp for many years.\u201d The quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend, an isolated hamlet known today as Boykin, have become minor celebrities in their own right. They were made from anything that was to hand \u2013 old blue jeans, strips of cloth, cornmeal sacks \u2013 and are vividly colourful and strikingly abstract. Reviewing a 2002 show at the Whitney, which included the quilts, a critic for the New York Times wrote: \u201cThe results \u2026 turn out to be some of the most miraculous works of modern art America has produced. Imagine Matisse and Klee \u2026 arising not from rarefied Europe, but from the caramel soil of the rural south in the form of women, descendants of slaves when Gee\u2019s Bend was a plantation.\u201d The Margate show will include quilts, paintings, and sculptural assemblages by more than 20 African American artists from Alabama and surrounding states. They include William Edmondson, usually called a folk art sculptor, who was the first African American to have a solo show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York; and Emmer Sewell, whose found object sculptures include Black-Panther-inspired scarecrows. The show was the idea of the artist Hannah Collins, who came across the artworks and stories while working in the American south. Photographs Collins took of the artists\u2019 working environments, Sewell\u2019s porch for example, will be included in the show. Victoria Pomery, director of Turner Contemporary, said the aim of the exhibition was for audiences to see works, traditionally categorised as folk or outsider art, in a new light. They were \u201cextraordinary works\u201d, she said. \u201cBringing this exhibition to Margate, one of the most deprived areas of the UK, highlights the global importance of creativity and its power to provoke change \u2026 fundamentally altering the course of an individual\u2019s life, challenging social inequality and inspiring vital debate.\u201d We Will Walk \u2013 Art and Resistance from the American South will run at Turner Contemporary from 7 February to 3 May."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
