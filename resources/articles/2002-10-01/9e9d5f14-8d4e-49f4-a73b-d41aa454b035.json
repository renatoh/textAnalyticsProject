Campaigners say the action could not be better timed, after the severe abuse England's black players faced in Slovakia last week and racist incidents involving black footballers playing for their English teams in European club matches. England is leading the way in the week of action which is being organised by Kick It Out, the anti-racism organisation, in conjunction with Fare, Football Against Racism in Europe. Over the next seven days events will be held throughout England and Wales and across the rest of Europe to highlight racism within the game, how it can be combated and the long history of black players' involvement in the game. Every professional league club in England and Wales will be holding a day of action to reiterate support for the campaign againstracism, while community groups and schools will also be involved. Clubs will issue statements warning fans that racist abuse will not be tolerated. Similar events are being held in Italy, Spain, Austria and Germany. The campaign is being backed by the England captain, David Beckham, and the England coach, Sven-Goran Eriksson. Beckham, who will lead out England at Southampton's St Mary's stadium tonight, said yesterday: \"I thought in the last couple of years racism had been cut out of the game. But you read things, you hear things. These things need to be cut out of the game because they're not good for the people involved and not good for the game.\" Uefa, European football's governing body, has still to decide what action it will take against Slovakia for its fans' racist abuse. Kick It Out claims that recent events have highlighted that racism is still a problem within the game and that clubs and football officials must continue to be vigilant. Campaigners say next year's anti-racism week of action will be even larger and will include eastern Europe. But Kick It Out says that while the focus has been on European football over the past few days the problem has not been eradicated from the British game. Last year police made 46 arrests for racist chanting and behaviour inside football grounds. Kick It Out estimates that it receives around 100 reports each season of racist incidents, but says the real figure could be almost twice as high. Piara Powar, national coordinator of Kick It Out, said: \"While the problem is worse in Europe there are still problems of racism within Britain. There's a lot more that clubs could do in fighting racism. \"They could make it clear to fans that they will not tolerate this behaviour and that those who racially abuse will be thrown out of stadiums. \"Football has to take a stand and has to get more involved in devising schemes to fight racism.\" \u00b7 Details of the week of action can be found on the website www.kickitout.org"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
