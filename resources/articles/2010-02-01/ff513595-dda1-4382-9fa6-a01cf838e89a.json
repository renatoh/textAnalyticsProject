The theatre prided itself on its conservatism, while Offenbach was essentially a subversive provocateur. The opera begins in territory worthy of Boccaccio: following the death of their eminently fondle-able parrot Vert-Vert, the girls at the convent school of Saint-R\u00e9my decide they will take thick but sexy gardener's boy Valentin as their pet instead. The need to write a respectable show for a respectable opera house, however, means that potential bawdry is jettisoned in favour of a rather conventional fable in which Valentin is emotionally and morally torn between virtuous childhood sweetheart Mimi and wicked opera diva La Corilla. Even a performance as fine as this can't paper over the resulting inconsistencies of mood and character. Valentin is an ideal role for Toby Spence, who does corrupted innocence better than anyone. Thora Einarsdottir (Mimi) and Jennifer Larmore (La Corilla) are the women in his life. Conducting David Parry, meanwhile, just about makes sense of the score's tricky mix of bravado and sentiment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
