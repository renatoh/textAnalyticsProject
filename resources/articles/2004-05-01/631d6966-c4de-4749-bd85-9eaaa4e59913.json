Mr Straw told senior MPs that soldiers were handed memos setting out their obligations on the treatment of captured Iraqis and that \"all possible steps\" were taken to ensure troops were briefed on their obligations. His comments to the Commons foreign affairs select committee come after Tony Blair said that if photographs published by the Daily Mirror, appearing to show British troops torturing an Iraqi prisoner proved to be genuine, such conduct would be \"completely unacceptable\". UK may send further troops The prime minister also confirmed that talks were ongoing with coalition partners \"about the possibility of providing more troops for different parts of the country\". Echoing Mr Blair, Mr Straw praised the contribution of British troops and called the regiment accused of the mistreatment, the Royal Lancashire, \"a very fine regiment\". Mr Straw also insisted that private firms were not involved in the custody and interrogation of Iraqi prisoners and dismissed suggestions the US called all the shots in Iraq, saying Britain had a \"disproportionately positive influence\". Earlier in the day, Mr Blair was repeatedly questioned about the occupation of Iraq, and conduct of the British forces there, during his weekly parliamentary question time. He reaffirmed that \"full sovereign control\" of Iraq would be passed onto an Iraqi authority on June 30 despite a White House spokesman's comments that the Iraqis would gain \"full sovereignty but only limited authority\". He did, however, leave some ambiguity about the authority's exact authority regarding coalition troops, saying that it was important British soldiers had \"proper chains of command\". Daily Mirror 'torture' photos Asked about the Daily Mirror's photographs of British troops allegedly abusing an Iraqi prisoner, Mr Blair told the Tory leader it would be \"completely unacceptable\" if proven to be true but added it would also be \"extremely serious\" if the photos turned out to be false. He insisted that the Royal Military Police \"should be allowed to carry out their investigations\", adding that he had \"every confidence that they will do so properly and truthfully - and then we can debate the findings\". Mr Blair said that the vast bulk of British troops would be \"horrified\" if any human rights abuses had been carried out in Iraq. He said: \"That is what we went to Iraq to get rid of, not to perpetuate.\" Mr Howard agreed that the photos had done \"enormous damage\" to the reputation of British troops and that \"if they turn out to be true, the severest action should be taken against those involved\". He added, however, that \"if they turn out to be false, this is a matter of the utmost seriousness for which the editor of the Daily Mirror [Piers Morgan] will have to take full responsibility\". Piers Morgan may be called to give evidence MPs are expected to announce this afternoon that they will call Mr Morgan in for questioning about the pictures, which military sources have suggested may be faked. The Commons defence committee chairman, Bruce George, will discuss with fellow committee members later today whether Morgan should be called to give evidence to the committee. This morning, Mr George said he was confident that his colleagues would agree to invite Morgan to appear. \"I think the interest in this is such that they will be prepared to endorse my view. We do have a lot of questions,\" he said. \"The issue is of immense national and international interest. I don't know if the pictures were genuine or not. If they are genuine, there is great cause for concern. If the pictures turn out to be a spoof, the hoax of the century, the damage is done. But at least there will be the satisfaction of knowing that the regiment is not guilty.\" Mr George said that if the committee did decide to invite Morgan to appear, the hearing was likely to be scheduled \"soon\". Fellow committee member Crispin Blunt said Mr Morgan should resign if the photographs turn out not to be genuine. \"These pictures have done a grave disservice to the nation. If they turn out not to be correct that would be a dreadful journalistic lapse and his position would be untenable,\" said Mr Blunt. The prime minister's official spokesman was asked whether the government was considering what steps it could take to pressure the Mirror into revealing the names of the soldiers who made the allegations. He said: \"I'm not going to get into public commentary on what individuals or individual organisations should do. We believe that people do have a duty to cooperate ... with the inquiries. It is for them to judge what that means. What is most important is that the truth be firmly established, whatever that truth is.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
