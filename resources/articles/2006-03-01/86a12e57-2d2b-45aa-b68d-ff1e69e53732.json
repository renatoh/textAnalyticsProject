The gameplay lacks the depth and sophistication of the superb Pro Evolution series, but is still highly playable. The innovative graphics (you can see beads of sweat run down Wayne Rooney's face if you look closely) make it the finest looking football game ever seen. There is one major criticism, however. After battling through the qualification process there is no World Cup proper to contest at the end of it all - no doubt a further \u00a340 will be needed, closer to the event, to see that. Good, but could have been even better."}, "isHosted": false}}}
