On Radio National on Monday Nicholls ruled out any \u201cdeals\u201d to form government, a coalition with or cabinet positions for One Nation, but did not rule out a preference deal or accepting supply and confidence from the minor party. Palaszczuk returns to work on Monday after a short holiday, with the Queensland election due any time between now and 5 May 2018. On Sunday a new Reachtel poll of 4,000 voters found the Labor government will struggle to retain power with the Liberal National party leading it 52% to 48% on a two-party preferred basis. Labor had a primary vote of 32.1%, compared with 30.6% for the LNP and 18.1% for One Nation, highlighting its potential role as a kingmaker in the election which will be the first since Labor reintroduced compulsory preferences. The Palaszczuk government is considering whether to call an election for late October or early November, or wait until February and hope some of One Nation\u2019s shine has worn off. Nicholls said whenever the election is called the LNP is \u201cready to go any time\u201d. \u201cI simply say to the Queensland premier, stop playing games, it\u2019s creating an enormous amount of business uncertainty up here,\u201d he said. Nicholls said since the parliament had set fixed four-year terms and the election was due from October, the premier should \u201ccome clean now and tell us what the election date is\u201d. Nicholls said there is \u201cno doubt there is voter disenchantment with the major parties ... and that means we have to work hard to articulate a clear vision for Queensland\u201d. The opposition leader said it would fight the election on jobs, infrastructure and the cost of living, \u201cincluding a 70% wholesale increase in the cost of power\u201d. Asked about sharing power with One Nation, Nicholls replied: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear, that there are no deals, there\u2019s no coalition and there\u2019s no room at the cabinet table for One Nation.\u201d He said that One Nation didn\u2019t share the LNP\u2019s values and, although it was very good at \u201chighlighting where there is a problem\u201d, it was \u201cnot so good at coming up with answers\u201d. Nicholls criticised Palaszczuk for reintroducing compulsory preferences, saying it was \u201can attempt to shore up inner city seats with Green votes\u201d and warning that \u201ca Labor and Greens alliance\u201d would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for Queensland. On the issue of the LNP\u2019s preferences, Nicholls said \u201crecommendations as to preferences will be a matter determined by the party as we get closer to the election date\u201d, in effect not ruling out a preference deal with One Nation. Asked about the Liberal preference deal with One Nation in the Western Australian election, Nicholls said there were many differences in that election in which the incumbent Barnett government attempted to win a third term. Nicholls said One Nation opposed exploration or development of gas reserves, suggesting jobs from gas development will be a major issue at the election. On Sunday the federal government indicated it could use the GST to try to force states to end bans on preventing gas developments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
