Americans spend an estimated $36bn on lawn care annually, and the amount of lawns we maintain could roughly cover the state of Florida. Lawns, not edible agriculture, are the biggest irrigated crop in America \u2013 and they are partly to blame for the decline in bees, insects and songbirds. Why should you care? Recent studies reveal that insect numbers are remarkably low \u2013 monarch and rusty-patched bumblebee populations are both down nearly 90% in the last 20 years. Scientists estimate the arthropod population on Earth is down 45% from pre-industrial numbers. Plummeting insect populations affect everything: birds and fish can\u2019t eat; portions of our food supply go unpollinated; entire ecosystems are at risk. \u201cAll of our good fortune \u2013 and our ecological future \u2013 depends on diversity,\u201d Benjamin Vogt, an urban prairie designer and author of A New Garden Ethic, tells me. With a shift in habits, your yard can change from a chemically drenched monoculture of little ecological value to a patch of land that supports critical biodiversity. Why are we so fond of lawns? Social scientists have traced our affection for lawns to \u201csavanna syndrome\u201d: an affinity for the short-grasses of east Africa where humans evolved. Though short grasses may please us and register visually as \u201csafe\u201d, ornamental lawns became a phenomenon in the late 1800s after authors Andrew Jackson Downing and Frank J Scott prescribed them as standards of beauty. Americans were lured by an age-old marketing approach, one utilized by razor and makeup entrepreneurs: convince consumers your products will transform their lives, and elevate an unkempt and slovenly appearance to a prosperous one. Lawn maintenance \u2013 once accomplished by slave labor for elites attempting to mimic the landscapes of European estates \u2013 is a hallmark of wealth, the opposite of swept-dirt lawns dotted with grazing livestock. A manicured lawn hints at patriotism, too. In 1914, the New York Times showed a photograph of Roosevelt mowing his lawn. After the second world war and white flight from city to suburb, the lawn became an aspirational symbol of white middle-class homeownership. In a 1989 opinion piece, Michael Pollan questioned the \u201cunmistakable odor of virtue that hovers in this country over a scrupulously maintained lawn\u201d. But what is virtuous about a habit that uses 7bn gallons of water a day, dumps an estimated 59m pounds of pesticides in residential areas each year, and bears responsibility for the deaths of millions of songbirds and bees? A better alternative exists, and not just for elites. The novelist and gardener Jeff VanderMeer feels that \u201cbenign neglect\u201d is superior to traditional lawn care. \u201cNot spending any money at all on fertilizers, or raking leaves,\u201d he says, \u201cis preferable, and doable on any budget.\u201d \u2018Lawn monocultures don\u2019t support life\u2019 When it comes to lawns and pesticide use, there\u2019s a gulf between what we know, and the decisions we make. I ask the author Benjamin Vogt about the moment he changed his own approach to gardening. \u201cI was working in my yard and saw a bug eating my milkweed,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought: \u2018I need to save my plant!\u2019 I ran inside to get poison, but on my way back, I became curious, and after some research realized that it was a monarch caterpillar eating the milkweed.\u201d Vogt now runs a business installing prairie ecosystems in place of lawns. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about individual plants,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut the life they support. Lawn monocultures don\u2019t support life.\u201d VanderMeer\u2019s conversion moment happened after returning to his home state of Florida after a stint in New York, and feeling as though he had taken wilderness for granted. \u201cWhen we moved to the new house on the edge of a wooded ravine,\u201d he tells me, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to become obsessed with rewilding, but I soon had to because the lovely jungle behind the house turned out to be invasive [non-native] air potato vine, invasive ferns, invasive spiderwort and invasive nandina bushes as well as invasive coral ardisia. Once I learned this, I was horrified, because there were 30-year-old box turtles down there and other wildlife that was severely compromised.\u201d The invasive species on VanderMeer\u2019s property were reducing the native species that insects, birds and herbivores relied on for food and habitat. Without intervention, the life that had previously called his part of Florida home would eventually die or move in search of food. Rewilding lawn space doesn\u2019t have to be all or nothing. For some, simply giving up heavy pesticide treatments is a beginning. VanderMeer focuses on his backyard and the ravine, while Vogt suggests people begin with one square foot. \u201cImagine if everyone started creating even a little rewilded space,\u201d he says. \u201cEventually, those square feet become acres of important habitat, maybe even a few corridors for wildlife.\u201d VanderMeer, who has spent several years undertaking a significant rewilding project, shared the following steps for replicating his efforts: Evaluate what you have that\u2019s beneficial and already readily growing, and encourage those plants. In his case, those included elderberry bushes, beautyberry bushes, pokeweed, native oak, pine and sweet gum. Evaluate what invasive species you have (as opposed to native) and prioritize \u2013 relative to your ability to remove it \u2013 which species need to be eradicated first. (You can research the best native plants for your garden zone here and find out what species of bug and butterfly they host.) Evaluate prior land use and institute immediate benign neglect. Discontinue pesticide and herbicide use; stop raking leaves, stop mowing wherever possible; mitigate prior damage if simple neglect is insufficient. Observe and evaluate practices by neighbors. If neighbors have outdoor cats or use lawn poisons, this might change your desire to attract birds. Make immediate improvements in some small area to attract pollinators and birds. (In VanderMeer\u2019s case, they planted wildflowers in two locations and put up bird feeders, with the understanding they would decommission some bird feeders once more native plants that could feed them were in the yard) Direct most efforts to eradication (through natural means) of the foremost invasives to allow the native seedbank to recover. Continue to plant native plants while removing invasives and studying \u201cvolunteers\u201d \u2013 new plants that sprout because the invasives have been removed. Evaluate results at the end of every season and recalibrate efforts accordingly. Not all non-native species are equally problematic. When prioritizing which non-native plants to remove from your property, think about the food value they provide to wildlife, and what native plants they are crowding out. Even if you don\u2019t rewild entirely, consider aiming for a restorative practice; the goal is to support more life. You can expect some challenges (including from neighbors) Rewilding a lawn will probably invite curiosity, admiration, confusion and disapproval. Vogt recalls a client who said: \u201cLook, I know we\u2019re going to have issues with neighbors. But I\u2019m OK with that. We\u2019ll talk it out. I know we need more examples of healthy lawns.\u201d Homeowner associations (HOAs) and neighbors are notorious for policing each other\u2019s attention \u2013 or inattention \u2013 to lawn care. Some HOAs fine homeowners daily for unmowed grass over 6in high. If you live in such a neighborhood, it\u2019s important to find out what rules are in place, and the process for challenging them. Vogt is less concerned about what the neighbors might say. \u201cWe need to be less afraid of outdated standards,\u201d he says, \u201cand more afraid of not implementing these changes.\u201d VanderMeer has generated what he considers a much healthier life in his backyard for possums, box turtles and migratory birds. His native plants provide more food sources and sanctuary for exhausted flocks en route to Latin America. The VanderMeer lawn now hosts endangered plant species including Chapman\u2019s azalea, of which there are only 4,000 in the world; a torreya tree; and royal flycatcher. Vandermeer notes that these plants are endangered because of contemporary development and landscape practices that clearcut native species for new housing, and then landscape using exotic species. Vogt talks about how beneficial the change can be on spirit and wallet. \u201cYou\u2019ll see fertilizer ads that suggest fertilizing your lawn four times a year. That\u2019s unnecessary, because most of it ends up as runoff in a storm drain. Plus,\u201d he adds, \u201ca 3in blade of grass can\u2019t clean our air the way a tree or meadow garden can.\u201d Be part of changing collective taste for the better What would it take for a nation to admit that its devotion to growing monocultures doused in non-organic chemical compounds is a harmful and outdated practice? Changing taste is difficult, especially where perceived beauty and prosperity are concerned. I turn to the renowned landscape architect and Harvard professor Gary Hilderbrand for his thoughts. Contrary to belief, one doesn\u2019t have to sacrifice visual narrative entirely to improve environmental outcomes. \u201cMeadows are a culturally important form, but people worry they look unkempt,\u201d Hilderbrand tells me. \u201cBut if you mow a narrow strip along the edge, suddenly it all begins to look cared for \u2013 like you\u2019ve intentionally let it grow long.\u201d Hilderbrand believes that cultural values are expressed through landscape, even at an institutional level. He points out that many lawns have cultural importance and intention, but can still incorporate sustainable methods like stormwater storage, improved soil ecology, drought-tolerant landscaping and native meadows. He asks me to consider the public realm: downtown blocks, city tree plans, communal greens. As citizens, we don\u2019t just notice what we see in these spaces, but how they make us feel. If we\u2019re able to create attractive and sustainable landscapes in public spaces, the aesthetic may inform personal taste. This is how lawn culture arose, and how it can shift again, ideally to a more sustainable practice. Hilderbrand believes in sharing images of like situations elsewhere in order to raise someone\u2019s appreciation for what a landscape can become. It is, he says, like giving people a new set of eyes. And in this moment, where we\u2019ve been forced by a pandemic to retreat to our private homes and gardens, perhaps we can challenge ourselves to reimagine them not as icons of individual prosperity, but as spaces that host and encourage living."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
