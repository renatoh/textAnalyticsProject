The US secretary of state Donald Rumsfeld, famously, considered this a laughably feeble form of non-torture, scribbling on a Pentagon memo that he stood for up to 10 hours every day \u2013 so why should these wimpish prisoners be spared? But after attempting to enact new advice that office workers should stand for four hours every working day, I begin to see what the interrogators were on about. True, the new guidance advises standing initially for at least two hours to reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes and even some cancers. But its authors are clear that they believe this to be only an interim target. All of us, they argue, should eventually aim to stand for half of the standard eight-hour working day. My (seated) editor suggested I give it a try. Standing to work is not a new thing: Leonardo da Vinci, Ben Franklin, Winston Churchill and Vladimir Nabokov are all said to have done it. Philip Roth wrote his novels on his feet, while James Murdoch, now chief operating officer of 21st Century Fox, is a self-confessed \u201cbig believer\u201d in standing while you work. I\u2019m assuming, however, that they each had a workspace that made it possible. Unfortunately, when I stand at my desk, I can\u2019t reach my keyboard without crouching, or see my screen without squinting. And so I install a laptop on top of a stack of lockers in a corridor, which places my keyboard at low chest height, and attempt to crack on with a normal day. This is fine for a while \u2013 I do an interview on my mobile, leaning louchely against the locker while colleagues shoot me quizzical looks as they pass. After about 40 minutes, however, I\u2019m feeling it in my knees, and take a sneaky 10 minute break. After returning, I try leaning forward against the locker, taking some of my weight on my kneecaps, but am then far too low to type, and also look like an idiot. An hour or so later, I reach Gavin Bradley, one of the report\u2019s authors. It turns out I am doing it all wrong. \u201cWe don\u2019t promote prolonged standing either,\u201d says Bradley, whose organisation Active Working CIC commissioned the research along with Public Health England. Instead of standing for hours on end, he says, they advise \u201cmixing it up\u201d with bursts of sitting and standing throughout the day \u2013 but never sitting for more than 30 minutes at a time. Fundamentally, says Bradley, sitting should not be our default position at work, but a rest position for when standing becomes tiring. I thank him, and sit. It\u2019s bliss. Bradley \u2013 in common, he says, with 90% of Scandinavians \u2013 uses a \u201csit-stand\u201d desk that adjusts in height when he gets to his feet or returns to his backside. Not being in possession of such a device, I improvise back at my desk with a couple of box files, several magazines and a tower of reporters\u2019 notebooks. This is better, but I can\u2019t see it catching on at Guardian HQ without a radical office redesign. My four hours done, I am, truthfully, relieved to slump back into my ergonomically supportive chair. Maybe I\u2019ll try again tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
