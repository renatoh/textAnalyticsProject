He was, however, happy to advertise his powers of prophecy, predicting a trilogy with the Mexican-American whatever the result of the fight on Saturday. After barely a minute of shadowboxing in a ring in front of a huge government complex in Riyadh, Joshua said Ruiz had been on his mind since he stepped in as a late replacement to meet him in June \u2013 and would continue to be whatever the result of their WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight title fight in Diriyah. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the last time I will be seeing Andy Ruiz in the ring,\u201d Joshua said. \u201cI think we make for good fights. I think there is going to be a knockout on Saturday and that is what people want to see, bloodshed and knockouts. And we\u2019ll definitely see each other the third time.\u201d Joshua, 30, looked relaxed and lean but denied he was deliberately looking for more speed. \u201cI am quick anyway. I am not looking for anything except the win. That\u2019s the objective. It\u2019s not about speed. It\u2019s like night and day. I shed some skin last time. Rebuilt myself. The objective is just about to win, win, win.\u201d As he left the stage, Joshua posed for selfies with a delighted crowd of local supporters and also stopped briefly to speak to Dillian Whyte, his fellow heavyweight who is also on the bill against Mariusz Wach. \u201cBring it back, yeah?\u201d Whyte told him, to which Joshua replied: \u201cWe are going to go hard, trust me.\u201d As they spoke Ruiz was in the ring, looking fast and sharp as he went through three rounds on the pads. Meanwhile Joshua\u2019s promoter, Eddie Hearn, told the Guardian that the British fighter will come in more than half a stone lighter than his first fight against Ruiz having spent much less time lifting weights. \u201cI don\u2019t like talking about weight because last time I said he would be at his lightest ever and he came in at his heaviest ever,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you will see something. \u201cHe was 17st 10lb in the first fight but he\u2019s much, much lighter now. I think he\u2019ll weigh around 17st 2lb. He\u2019s not been pumping weights, he\u2019s been watching his diet, eating really clean. This camp has been 15 or 16 weeks not 10 or 11 as normal. He\u2019s been sparring, sparring, sparring.\u201d Hearn added: \u201cHe looks great, he feels great and he is lean, lean. He has cut out a lot of strength and conditioning work and this camp has been boxing related. He is boxing fit.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
