A White House official said staffers had consulted with Trump after his initial tweet opposing the administration\u2019s stance. The House passed a bill this morning to reauthorize the key foreign intelligence collection program with an important tweak. It requires the FBI to get a warrant if it wants to view the contents of Americans\u2019 communications swept up in the process. The House passed what is known as Section 702 of a program that allows spy agencies to collect information on foreign targets abroad. The bill passed 256-164. The Senate must still pass the bill before it is sent to the White House for the president\u2019s signature. Earlier, the House rejected a measure to impose stiffer restrictions on the FBI. It would have required the FBI to get a warrant to continue even querying the database when Americans are involved. \u201cThis vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land,\u201d Trump said in a morning tweet a few hours before the votes. \u201cWe need it! Get smart!\u201d But before that he had sent out a contradictory tweet suggesting that the programme was used to collect information that might have been used to taint his campaign. \u201c\u2018House votes on controversial FISA ACT today,\u2019\u201d Trump wrote, citing a Fox News headline. \u201cThis is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?\u201d Representative Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said Trump\u2019s tweets were \u201cinaccurate, conflicting and confusing\u201d. He suggested that a vote on the bill should be delayed until the White House\u2019s position can be ascertained. But Republicans said the vote should be held. The program allows US spy agencies to collect information on foreign targets outside the United States. Americans\u2019 communications are inadvertently swept up in the process and privacy advocates and some lawmakers want to require the FBI to get a warrant if it wants to query and view the content of Americans\u2019 communications that are in the database to build domestic crime cases. Trump\u2019s initial tweet linking the Fisa programme that his White House supports to the dossier that alleges his campaign had ties to Russia seemed to be in opposition to his administration\u2019s position, potentially putting the reauthorisation vote in doubt. His tweets came shortly after a Fox &amp; Friends segment that highlighted the Fisa programme, calling it \u201ccontroversial\u201d. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, A Republican who has also made the television rounds in recent days, has pushed for less invasive spying measures. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, struggled to explain the apparent about-face as she was repeatedly questioned during Thursday\u2019s press briefing. Jim Acosta, CNN\u2019s chief White House correspondent, said: \u201cThere seems to be a pattern \u2013 and correct me if I\u2019m wrong and there is no pattern \u2013 where the president watches something on Fox &amp; Friends and then he tweets about it.\u201d Pundit Andrew Napolitano had appeared on the show and criticised the Fisa programme, noted Acosta, who asked if there was a cause and effect at work. Sanders tried to deflect the question by saying: \u201cI\u2019m sure you are disappointed he\u2019s not watching CNN.\u201d Acosta, often a thorn in the side of the administration, shot back: \u201cI think he watches a lot of CNN, if you don\u2019t mind me saying it.\u201d Sanders replied tartly: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. Your numbers would be higher.\u201d There were some disapproving howls in the press room. The spokeswoman continued: \u201cThe president has a great deal of understanding. This is top of mind. He was talking about it last week. He has issued a presidential memo on it, so it\u2019s not just something that happened this morning. It\u2019s been an ongoing discussion and something of great importance to the president.\u201d In another testy exchange, Hallie Jackson, chief White House correspondent of NBC News, challenged Sanders: \u201cHis tweet today was confusing. It was contradictory. It just was.\u201d She asked how anyone could trust that those who claim to represent the president\u2019s position actually are. The press secretary replied dismissively: \u201cI think that the premise of your question is completely ridiculous and shows the lack of knowledge that you have on this process. I\u2019ve tried several times \u2013 I\u2019ll do it for a 10th time here. Look, the president supports the 702 but he has some very strong concerns about the Fisa programme more generally \u2026 [The tweet] wasn\u2019t confusing for me; I\u2019m sorry if it was for you.\u201d The president\u2019s reversal was yet another example of him seemingly taking cues from television, particularly the morning Fox News show, while also personalising an issue, in this case the dossier, over a policy position. There are no obvious links between the dossier and the reauthorization of the spying program, but Trump has repeatedly denounced the document in recent days. The dossier has been back in the news with the release of a transcript of a congressional interview with Glenn Simpson, one of the men behind it. The document \u2013 compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele \u2013 makes an allegation that there was a \u201cconspiracy of cooperation\u201d between Russian agents and the Trump campaign, and the president has frequently scorned it since its publication last January. In March last year, Trump drew fierce criticism when he suggested without evidence that Barack Obama had \u201cwire-tapped\u201d his offices in New York before the presidential election."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
