The Spaniard is out of contract next summer, though United do have an option of another year. Yet given De Gea\u2019s consistently superb form as one of the world\u2019s best goalkeepers, and his importance to the side, there is a will from Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and the Old Trafford hierarchy to secure the 27-year-old\u2019s services for the long term. The Spaniard came close to joining Real Madrid in the summer of 2015 when Louis van Gaal was in charge at United. Real, though, left their bid to the final day and an offer of \u00a329.3m proved unsuccessful when the requisite paperwork was not filed in time. De Gea subsequently signed his current improved terms, though the threat of him leaving for the Bernab\u00e9u continued to linger. The European champions signed Thibaut Courtois on Thursday, which appears to have ended their pursuit of De Gea \u2013 for the moment at least. Yet, while it is understood this removes a potential complication regarding De Gea prolonging a United career that began in June 2011, there is a confidence he would have agreed the fresh deal even if Courtois had not joined Real. Since Sir Alex Ferguson brought De Gea to Old Trafford for \u00a318.9m, a record at the time for a goalkeeper in English football, he has won the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League. The Spaniard claimed last season\u2019s domestic Golden Glove and United\u2019s Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year, the award voted for by fans. He previously claimed it for three successive seasons, a record."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
