Some 17 years, to be exact. Every afternoon, as we bang this tat out, we tell ourselves that it won't be forever and that soon we'll jack it all in to go inter-railing round the Fens. It's a dream, and we're clearly deluded, but we're not alone. Take Peter Ridsdale for example. \"Mistakes were made [during my time at Leeds] but I don't regret the ambition we had and the pursuit of that ambition,\" he said today, through rose-tinted, diamond-encrusted half-moon specs. \"Did we make mistakes? Of course we did. Did we invest too much? Time would suggest that we invested too much as well.\" As would a village idiot dropped head-first from a tree. But clearly Peter's not to blame for Leeds United's \u00a349.5m debt and spectacular nosedive down the Premiership. \"It's us who have not been performing,\" blubbed Dominic Matteo, ruing the passing of Peter Reid. \"I thought he did a good job and us as players maybe let him down,\" he added, just 24 hours too late. \"I'm gutted for him.\" But now is clearly not a time for looking back, nor for screaming \"Where's all the effing the money gone?!!\" No, it's time to dream of a brighter future with a new manager. \"There won't be any shortage of candidates because Leeds is still one of those big clubs and we need to get back to our rightful position,\" stressed Leeds' irony-free chief suit Trevor Birch. And depending on which shadowy source you listen to, one of those candidates may/may not be Paul Hart. \"We can't prevent speculation, it's something all clubs with successful mangers have to live with,\" said Forest chairman Nigel Doughty, warning Leeds off his heavily sedated man. \"I'm the manager of Nottingham Forest as far as I know,\" woozed Hart. Fellow contender Neil Warnock has refused to comment, which is novel, but Leeds caretaker boss Eddie Gray was more than happy to. \"Anyone in football, especially someone who's been at Leeds United for a long time, will be interested,\" he said, narrowing the criteria down to suit his spiel. \"But the most important thing now is to get us to win games.\" From where the Fiver's sat, talk of winning games suggest he's overqualified for this job. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I'm not going to speculate on speculation. We don't want to add anything to a story that's not there. Sheffield United have got a manager and Leeds United haven't\" - That's speculation in the Fiver's book. Although in his defence, Sheffield United vice-chairman Terry Robinson could point out that not shoe-horning this quote into the first story is lazy journalism on the Fiver's part. * * * * * * * * * * * * GED'S (TITLE HOPES ARE) DEAD Almost five years ago to the day, Gerard Houllier embarked on his \"five-year plan\" to bring the glory years back to Liverpool. Oh dear. Now, you might think the decent course of action to take would be to DO ONE NOW, GED, WHILE EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THIS SORRY FARCE STILL HAS A FEW REMAINING SCRAPS OF DIGNITY AND SELF-RESPECT in order to make way for someone more capable of mounting a proper title challenge. Like Martin O'Neill. Or Peter Reid. You might think that. \"In the summer of 1999 I said I needed to rebuild and that I would need a minimum of five years to win the league,\" began Ged today, his eyes spinning faster than Peter Mandelson to slip in that \"a minimum of\" bit. \"We have made big steps forward,\" he continued. \"We have won six trophies, both at home and in Europe, played in [Big Cup] twice and reached the quarter-finals, and have progressed in the Premiership. Mind you, now we've started going backwards at full pelt, and I've no idea how to apply the brakes other than to constantly pick the most preposterous striker in the world and watch him thrash around painfully like a landed salmon.\" At least we think that's what our shorthand says. Still, there is some good news for Liverpool fans. (No, not that, he's still there. Think about it, who on earth's going to buy him?) Steven Gerrard today signed a new contract with the club, which means Anfield can enjoy watching overhit crossfield passes until 2007 at the very least. \"I'm proud of how Stevie has developed.\" simpered Ged, \"and maybe one day he could win the award that Michael won - the European Footballer of the Year trophy.\" Never mind that, Ged, when's Stevie going to pick up a Premiership medal? \"I think we can win the league in the time I predicted in 1999,\" promised the manager. Which, if we take him at his word, could mean any time between this season and infinity. * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL After watching Sevilla's Jose Reyes destroy Real Madrid at the weekend, Gerard Houllier's eyes are again whirling around like a washing machine on its spin cycle. Meanwhile Henrik Larsson, whose eye for the target apparently interests Barcelona, could move the other way. And get this: Cardiff want Ray Parlour. Apparently they'll pay Arsenal \u00a31.5m for Romford Ray's services and also hand Parlour a \u00a31m signing on fee. * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Tottenham's Anthony Gardner has been called up to the England squad to face Denmark on Sunday. Old man Gareth Southgate has pulled out with chilblains, sorry, a thigh injury. Newcastle defender Jonathan Woodgate could return for the Toon's clash with Manchester City a week on Saturday after recovering from double hernia surgery. Despite losing 3-1 at Charlton last Saturday, Fulham boss Chris Coleman has come over all ambitious, and plans to make a swoop for Monaco goal machine Dado Prso. Monsieur Prso scored four goals in the 8-3 demolition of Deportivo in Big Cup. He'll be champing at the bit to get to Loftus Road then. And prepare yourselves for another thrilling 'Battle of Britain' as 11 Britain-based players are up for European Footballer of the Year. Arsenal head the list with Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires, Sol Campbell, Thierry Henry and, ahem, Sylvain Wiltord receiving nominations. Also up for the award are Henrik Larsson, Claude Makelele, Adrian Mutu, Michael Owen, Paul Scholes and Ruud van Nistelrooy. * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV (WHICH THE FIVER CAN'T WATCH BECAUSE A MAN FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY HAS JUST DONE ONE WITH ITS SET) &amp; RADIO ITV1: Football League Extra (3am) Years ago, when the Fiver was a young pup, it would take the time to write this section itself. World Football (3.25am) The section would be full of facile comments such as: Five: Dutch Football (3.55am) \"Does anyone seriously stay up to watch this?\" British Cocking Eurosport: News (11pm) But was nonetheless usually worth reading for some frankly unnecessary pops at Eurosport, included simply because they used to really annoy one of the blokes in their press office. Sky Sports 1: Netbusters (6.30pm) Ah, salad days, they were. You're On Sky Sports (10pm) Nowadays, of course, we resort to pasting up links to things on Ebay like this...
