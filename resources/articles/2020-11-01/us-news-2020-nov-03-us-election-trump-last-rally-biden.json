But even as the US president was airing grievances about the Russia investigation, impeachment, and Hillary Clinton at 12.15am, his rival, Joe Biden, tweeted a warning: \u201cIf we give Donald Trump another four years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation. We can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d The battle for hearts and minds \u2013 and eyeballs \u2013 came in the early hours of an election day plagued by nerve-racking uncertainties. Although a record 100m early votes have already been cast either in person or by mail, according to the US Elections Project, tens of millions remain up for grabs before polls close. Then comes an anxious count that could take hours, days or even weeks before producing a definitive winner, with Trump seemingly eager to throw matches into the electoral tinderbox. Fearful of potential for protest and violence, shops were boarded up in cities including Washington, New York and Raleigh, North Carolina. \u201cSay a prayer for the country tonight,\u201d tweeted George Conway, a lawyer and cofounder of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump organisation. Both candidates spent Monday in a frantic race to the finish in the battleground states that will decide the electoral college, the climax of a presidential contest upended by a coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 230,000 people and put millions out of work. Biden\u2019s final drive-in rally in Pittsburgh had star power courtesy of singer Lady Gaga, who wore a white sweater with the word \u201cJoe\u201d. She played hits and told supporters to \u201cgo out and vote\u201d. The former vice-president, speaking from a lectern bearing the words \u201cBattle for the soul of the nation\u201d, said: \u201cI have a feeling we\u2019re coming together for a big win tomorrow ... It\u2019s time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home.\u201d Biden condemned Trump\u2019s failure to control Covid-19, became visibly angry as he recalled the president\u2019s mockery of military servicemen and rested his case: \u201cNo nation in the world can match us. We lead by the power of our example, not just the example of our power. The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself. No one else can challenge us. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what Donald Trump has been doing from the beginning of his campaign. Dividing America. Tearing us apart. Pitting Americans against one another based on our race, our gender, our ethnicity, our religion. That\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s not who we are. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let\u2019s keep showing them who we are.\u201d Then, as the long awaited date of 3 November arrived, Trump had just taken the stage in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the scene of his last campaign stop in 2016 before his astonishing victory over Clinton (\u201cWe can be a little bit superstitious, right?\u201d he asked). The president dismissed polls that showed Biden leading in Michigan and nationally as he surveyed thousands of supporters. \u201cThis is not the crowd of somebody who is going to lose the state of Michigan,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThis is not the crowd of a second place finisher. Do you agree with that?\u201d The crowd \u2013 eschewing face masks and physical distancing \u2013 chanted: \u201cFour more years! Four more years!\u201d The incumbent sought to portray himself as an insurgent who will drain the swamp and put America first. \u201cIf I don\u2019t sound like a typical Washington politician, it\u2019s because I\u2019m not a politician,\u201d he said. Trump added: \u201cJoe Biden is bought and paid for by big tech, big media and powerful special interests ... And he\u2019s not going to win, I really don\u2019t believe he\u2019s going to win, because of this,\u201d he told the crowd. Trump rounded off what might prove his last ever campaign rally with fist pumps to the sound of the Village People\u2019s \u201cY.M.C.A\u201d at 1.13am. By then he had already suffered electoral defeat in Dixville Notch, a tiny New Hampshire township where Biden took all five votes cast. No president has won re-election with an approval rating as low as Trump\u2019s average of 44%. He is in danger of becoming the first incumbent president to lose re-election since fellow Republican George H W Bush was beaten by Bill Clinton in 1992. But the nation was holding its breath not over who will win but when the result will be known. Early voting includes 60m mail-in ballots that could take days or weeks to be counted in some states, meaning that a winner might not be declared in the hours after polls close on Tuesday night. The president urged the supreme court to reconsider a decision that enables Pennsylvania to count mail ballots that arrive up to three days after election day. The court has left that possibility open. Without evidence, the president told reporters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that the decision \u201callows tremendous cheating\u201d then added on Twitter it \u201cwill also induce violence in the streets\u201d, \u2013 a potential green light to supporters to use aggressive voter intimidation tactics. Twitter flagged his message, adding a disclaimer to the tweet that its content was \u201cdisputed\u201d and \u201cmight be misleading\u201d. There are also concerns that Trump could seek to declare victory prematurely if early results go in his favour. Jennifer O\u2019Malley Dillon, Biden\u2019s campaign manager, told reporters: \u201cUnder no scenario will Donald Trump be declared a victor on election night.\u201d Barack Obama, whom Biden served as vice-president for eight years, said Trump\u2019s push to stop counting votes on election night was undemocratic. \u201cThat\u2019s what a two-bit dictator does,\u201d he told a rally in Miami. \u201cIf you believe in democracy, you want every vote counted.\u201d In a jab at Republicans who have turned a blind eye to Trump\u2019s contempt for norms and institutions, the 44th president said: \u201cIf there was a Democrat who was behaving this way, the way our current president does, I couldn\u2019t support him.\u201d Obama went on: \u201cIf I saw a Democrat who was lying every single day \u2013 the fact checkers can\u2019t keep up, it\u2019s like, just over and over again \u2013 I would say that\u2019s not the example I want, I don\u2019t trust that person to manage the country\u2019s affairs because it\u2019s violating the values that we try to live by. And these are values we try to teach our kids.\u201d Trump was due to be interviewed by Fox News early on Tuesday morning and told reporters he plans to visit his campaign headquarters in northern Virginia. He will then host family and friends on in the east room of the White House as results come in. Biden announced an unusual move to continue campaigning on Tuesday, saying he would head to Philadelphia and his native Scranton in Pennsylvania as part of a get-out-the-vote effort. His running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, will visit Detroit in Michigan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
