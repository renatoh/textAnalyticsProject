But it\u2019s not just about goals \u2013 it\u2019s about feeling at home, and I really do.\u201d Afobe was able to say the same of Arsenal for more than 15 years and it will be lost on no one that the 22-year-old, who left north London for Wolverhampton Wanderers in January 2015 after two long-term injuries and a succession of loans had stalled his path to the first team, will face his former club on Sunday at a time of stark contrast in their potency. Arsenal have failed to score in three Premier League fixtures while Afobe, who became Bournemouth\u2019s record signing last month, has managed a goal a game over the same period. There are no regrets on Afobe\u2019s side but it is still striking to hear how impersonally football clubs can deal with players who have, in one way or another, been part of the fabric for so long. Afobe was on loan at MK Dons, finally enjoying both the regular football and form in front of goal he had craved, when Wolves\u2019 bid was accepted and there was no grand farewell, no return to shake hands, no explanatory phone call between then and his first training session with the Championship club. \u201cI could probably have asked but I didn\u2019t want to hear anything,\u201d Afobe says. \u201cI thought: \u2018I\u2019m confident, scoring goals, I don\u2019t need to hear anything negative.\u2019 \u201cI love them, love everyone at Arsenal, but it would have been nice to have got my chance because, to be honest, I don\u2019t think I got a fair chance in the first team. I never made an appearance while there have been players who haven\u2019t had great Arsenal careers who played five or 10 games, but that\u2019s a story for another day. \u201cMaybe it was better to leave Arsenal without playing a game because everyone knows I didn\u2019t get a chance. If I had played four or five games and was terrible, you start thinking you are an Arsenal reject. For me it was just that the chance didn\u2019t come.\u201d Confidence should not be mistaken for bitterness; Afobe would never have a bad word for anyone at Arsenal and the feeling would be reciprocated towards as courteous and good-humoured a young man as has passed through the club\u2019s academy. Many fall by the wayside when success does not come instantly but Afobe had the self-awareness to understand that his surroundings came with no guarantees. \u201cThere was a stage where I was not so much doubting my ability, but doubting if I would be the player I thought I would be,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was more that the process was taking much longer than I thought it would. \u201cAt Arsenal you\u2019re training with England Under-19 players, you\u2019re seeing F\u00e0bregas or Van Persie next to you in the dressing room, and you think \u2013 not in an arrogant way, but you do think it \u2013 \u2018I am here, I am not far away.\u2019 But you are. Sitting in the same changing room, having a joke with them, having dinner out with them, you have to know that these players are miles ahead in terms of what they have done.\u201d The biggest period of reflection came towards the end of an unhappy loan at Sheffield Wednesday in 2014. Afobe had just returned from an eight-month knee injury and never felt quite himself during 13 games that brought two goals. Previous spells at Huddersfield Town, Reading, Bolton Wanderers and Millwall had held various merit but there was the acute feeling things were slipping away. \u201cIt got to me a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve always dreamed of scoring goals in the Premier League and I started to think to myself: \u2018Will I ever get this chance?\u2019 \u201cThe penny dropped around the final game of the season. I\u2019d been telling my mates: \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re going on holiday, we\u2019re going to do this and this for a few weeks,\u2019 but then I thought: \u2018Do you know what? If you don\u2019t buck your ideas up you\u2019re just going to be a player that falls away, a what-could-have-been kind of player\u2019.\u201d The holiday \u2013 it would have been to New York \u2013 was postponed and Afobe set about preparing body and mind for a pre-season in which he felt far more like the explosive, cold-blooded forward who had been prolific at all junior levels from the age of six. He ate better, slept better, decided this was the time to start from scratch. Nineteen goals followed over a remarkable half-season in Milton Keynes, quickly forming an intuitive relationship with Dele Alli that set Karl Robinson\u2019s team fair for promotion from League One. \u201cHe was my room-mate at the time,\u201d says Afobe of Alli, whom he regularly texts to congratulate on his exploits for Tottenham Hotspur. \u201cIt was nice to see an 18-year-old playing with such a smile on his face. I think we had eight different celebrations \u2013 we knew one of us would score and it goes to the stage where we would say \u2018when you score, let\u2019s do this\u2019. We had a great partnership on and off the pitch.\u201d Afobe keeps some high-profile company. Jack Wilshere is one of his closest friends while Ross Barkley is among those to have become an ally during years in the England setup that included a victorious Uefa Under-17 Championship in 2010. There is also Harry Kane, whom he outscored by one goal \u2013 32 to 31 \u2013 last season and played alongside during his early years in Arsenal\u2019s academy. \u201cI remember playing up front with him,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was only small at the time, a bit of a late developer, but he always loved scoring goals. It\u2019s weird because he used to play in goal sometimes, and wasn\u2019t bad actually. You wouldn\u2019t think it \u2013 remember that goal he let in for Tottenham when he had go in [against Asteras] last season?\u201d Afobe says he feels like a \u201cproud brother\u201d when he sees Kane and Alli doing well and senses that all three are among those at the vanguard of a young English generation that is beginning to deliver regularly in the top flight. \u201cI saw the stats on Tuesday \u2013 16 goalscorers in the Premier League, and 11 of them English,\u201d he says, having contributed one himself in Bournemouth\u2019s 2-1 win over Crystal Palace. \u201cWe are starting to make a name for ourselves, and it\u2019s even better when players from lower leagues have stepped up and done well. Harry, Dele, me, we\u2019ve all gone out on loan and it shows it can be done. It shows players outside the Premier League that they can make the step up.\u201d Afobe remembers his agent telling him, upon the move to Wolves, that a stint longer than two years at Molineux would have meant he was doing something wrong in his career. By that measure he is ahead of schedule and feels Eddie Howe, who convinced him to join Bournemouth during a phone call in which he outlined with clarity the areas where Afobe excelled and could improve, has immediately made him a better player. The memory of Arsenal will become more vivid this weekend but he believes his decade and a half of ups and downs in north London created the character whose trajectory could barely have been steeper in the last 18 months. \u201cRight now, I think mentality is probably my best attribute,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t get scared, don\u2019t fear anyone. Going out on loan, being unsuccessful, living in different parts of England \u2013 all that has helped me a lot. I think my mental strength came from that. I wouldn\u2019t have had it if I broke through at Arsenal when I was 18.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
