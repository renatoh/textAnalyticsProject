Coral is sensitive to global warming because hotter water kills the protective Symbiodinium algae, \"bleaching\" the reefs. Two reports in this week's Nature now reveal the situation may not be as bad as scientists thought. Rob Rowan of the University of Guam and Andrew Baker and colleagues at Columbia University separately discovered that some corals have already adapted to higher temperatures and now host specially adapted Symbiodinium. If other reefs can do the same, then they too should survive in warmer seas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
