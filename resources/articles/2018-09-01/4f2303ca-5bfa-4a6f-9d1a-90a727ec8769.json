Following the death of its founder in 2014, Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia \u2013 who worked with de la Renta for 12 years \u2013 are now at the helm. On Tuesday at New York fashion week, they showed off their spring/summer 2019 collection. While the weather was foggy, a flower-covered rooftop and acapella soundtrack formed the perfect backdrop to clothes that demanded a better forecast. Luckily for Kim and Garcia, the rain remained at a light drizzle. The sun even threatened to shine as models including Gigi and Bella Hadid completed the finale. The collection showed a brand in transition \u2013 from being the gold standard for classic cocktail dressing to something in tune with the more relaxed way that women increasingly approach their wardrobes. The first section featured kaftans and tunics more appropriate for poolside than cocktail hour, as well as separates like wide-legged trousers and blouses. Flats \u2013 not a regular on a de la Renta catwalk \u2013 also featured. Kim and Garcia are conscious, however, that they still need to hit that de la Renta look. Hence the gowns. With beading, lace, taffeta volume and fringing, the longtime customer are catered for. Shorter lengths and cutout details gave a less genteel look. At a preview before the show, the designers explained that holidays in Morocco, Croatia, India and Mykonos inspired the prints, as well as the kaftans and sari-like details. The separates were a conscious shift to appeal to a younger generation, together with higher hemlines. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a sexier collection. We are surrounded by people who want to wear sexy clothes,\u201d said Garcia. \u201cI feel like there was a lack of leg recently,\u201d added Kim. \u201cIt\u2019s time to bring that back.\u201d De la Renta might not be the most obvious place to bring the miniskirt back into fashion but this duo \u2013 along with chief executive Alex Bolen, de la Renta\u2019s son-in-law \u2013 see it as part of their mission to gently guide this much-loved Manhattan label into 2018. \u201cWe have made the clothes more comfortable, much lighter to travel in,\u201d said Kim. Garcia added: \u201cEven the gowns, you can put it in your bag and go to a wedding ... Aesthetic wise, it\u2019s never going to be cool, downtown. It\u2019s very feminine and all about making her happy and, this time, a bit sexy.\u201d . With price tags that rarely dip below four figures, this is a brand that remains prohibitive for a younger customer \u2013 but there is now a more concerted effort for courting them beyond just the show. A handbag advertising campaign was launched this week, using influencers including Camila Coehlo and Aimee Song, for the first time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
