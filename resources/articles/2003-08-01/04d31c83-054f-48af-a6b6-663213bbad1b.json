Saints ran out of substitutes in the second half with their Australian prop Darren Britt joining the club's list of long-term casualties in the first minute and Millward's reaction was astonishing. \"I'm not going to tell you what's up with him,\" he snapped, followed by a stream of expletives, after being asked about Britt's injury, thought to be a fractured eye socket. And Britt was not the only one. \"We can't win the competition,\" Millward added. \"We are running out of troops. We might have thrown our last dice.\" All this after Saints' eighth straight win to consolidate their place in the top four, with two tries from their former Hull KR forward Jon Wilkin. Warrington did their play-off hopes a power of good yesterday with a 29-16 win at Castleford, while London Broncos dropped a point at Wakefield . Nathan Wood starred for the Wolves with a first-half try and a late drop goal, with Graham Appo kicking six goals. The defeat means that Castleford slip to ninth, their lowest position of the season while London climb to eighth but they were still a disappointed bunch as they returned down the M1 last night after allowing Wakefield to come back from 16 points down to pinch a 26-26 draw at Belle Vue. Andrew King and Nigel Roy each scored two tries as the Broncos took a 26-10 lead but tries from Jamie Rooney and a second for Richard Newlove cut Wakefield's deficit to four points, then Michael Korkidas crossed in the last minute to bring the scores level, with Rooney missing a conversion attempt which would have won the game. In National League One, Salford , Leigh and Rochdale assured their places in the top three with convincing home wins. Salford thrashed Doncaster 72-0 while Tommy Martyn scored two tries in Leigh's 38-2 win against his old club Oldham . Neil Turley also scored 18 points from seven goals and his 100th try for Leigh. Rochdale beat Dewsbury 52-14 at Spotland with 20 points from their former student international Mick Nanyn, leaving the Rams rooted more firmly to the bottom of the table. There were also wins yesterday for the top three in National League Two: Sheffield Eagles, Chorley and Keighley ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
