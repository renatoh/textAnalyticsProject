Members of the Association of University Teachers and Natfhe last week voted overwhelmingly in favour of industrial action. Turnout was 51% and 47% respectively. The Universities and Colleges Employers' Association (Ucea) said it was disappointed at the unions' decision to strike. The unions are seeking a third of the income generated by increased student tuition fees to restore academic pay after decades of decline. They have warned that millions of students would be left with cancelled lectures, unmarked coursework and exams chaos unless a concerted effort is made to resolve the dispute. The action will be taken by lecturers, researchers and academic-related staff across the UK. But the two unions, which are merging, stressed that industrial action was an \"absolute last resort\" and remained committed to resolving the dispute before it reached the picket line. The general secretary of the AUT, Sally Hunt, said the decision had not been taken lightly. \"The employers have had months to stop this happening, and even after our resounding mandate from members for industrial action, they still haven't made us a pay offer,\" she said. \"I am extremely saddened that it has got this far.\" The general secretary of Natfhe, Paul Mackney, added: \"Lecturers are demanding that their salary levels are restored to those of comparable professionals. \"Vice-chancellors recently paid themselves a 25% increase over three years.\" He warned that employers had just a few days to prevent the campaign of industrial action from going ahead. A Ucea spokesman said: \"This announcement is extremely disappointing to employers, staff, students and parents. AUT and Natfhe claim disruption is 'an absolute last resort', but this pre-planned industrial action will not be put on hold so that discussions can take place. AUT and Natfhe members who voted yes represent less than 10% of all HE employees. The framework agreement and new single pay spine cover all staff, from porters to professors, which means employers need to reach a settlement with all of the unions - not just two of the seven. Employers remain firmly committed to dialogue, not dispute.\" The higher education minister, Bill Rammell, said he hoped, even at this late stage, that a resolution could be reached \"because it is crucial that students' education is not disrupted\". The unions are angry that universities have not used new government funding to boost pay. In April 2004, the then higher education minister, Alan Johnson, told MPs that vice-chancellors had said that at least one-third of the income generated from tuition fees and extra funding would be ploughed back into academic salaries."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
