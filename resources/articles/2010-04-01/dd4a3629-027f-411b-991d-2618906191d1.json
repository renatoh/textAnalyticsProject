Behind me I can hear the sound of swearing and ski poles being crossed in anger. I once saw the youngest one and the middle one get into a full-scale fist fight in a ski-hire shop in Slovenia. Three years and several expensive lessons later, they have graduated to fighting while travelling downhill at 20 miles an hour. Despite my determination to keep well ahead of them, they eventually draw up either side of me. \"He's being a total idiot,\" the middle one says. \"He just hit me with his pole for no reason.\" \"It was an accident,\" the youngest one says. \"That is such a lie,\" the middle one says. \"Oh. My. God,\" the youngest says. \"You shouldn't fight while you're skiing,\" I say. \"It's not safe.\" \"I'm never skiing with him again,\" the middle one says. \"As far as I'm concerned,\" I say, \"no one is ever skiing with anyone again.\" Later I get into a rather public argument with the youngest one because I won't let him ski alone. It's a battle I've already fought and lost \u2013 he's been skiing alone for an hour and a half \u2013 but I've suffered a late pang of conscience over my lack of supervision. From his point of view, this sudden reversal is monstrously unfair. He makes this point in a manner that leaves me wondering how many people in the immediate vicinity understand English. \"Don't call me that,\" I say. \"Why not? That's what you're being like.\" \"You're coming with me,\" I say. \"And that's that.\" After this exchange he refuses to speak for the whole of the long ride up the chair lift. I stare into the mist, feeling slightly guilty for being glad of the peace and quiet. Somewhere below us I can hear a father shouting at his child, and I think: jerk. At the top of the mountain the weather has turned nasty: a hard wind is driving heavy snow across the piste, rendering its contours invisible. In these conditions, it seems steeper than I remember. \"This is terrible,\" shouts the boy above the wind's rip. \"I hate you, Dad!\" I pick my way down the slope until his outline fades, but as soon as I stop it begins to sharpen up again, making tight little turns in my direction. \"I can't believe you forced me to come up here!\" he shrieks. \"I'm freezing! This completely sucks!\" A year ago I would have had to coax him down using a combination of promises, soothing words and terrible threats. I probably would have had to carry his skis part of the way. I notice, however, that his skiing has really come along over the course of the week; all I have to do is retreat to the limit of the audible range of his abuse, and let him chase after me. A few hundred metres down, everything changes again. The wind dies and the sun comes out. With my hat off, I can hear birds singing. From out of the mist I see the boy racing toward me, arms out, coat flapping. As he passes he turns to look at me with cold blue eyes. \"You don't have to wait for me,\" he says. At the bottom he skids neatly to a halt in front of the cafe table where his mother is sitting. \"How was that?\" I hear her say as I slide up behind him. \"Really good,\" he says, kicking off his skis and jabbing his poles into the snow. My wife looks at me, one eyebrow rising behind her sunglasses. I decide that what happened on the top of the mountain should stay on the top of the mountain: my face betrays nothing. \"Perhaps you might like to try a smile,\" she says to me. \"Everyone else is having fun.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
