If you\u2019re nervous, you limit your quality\u2019", "bodyText": "In the dappled shade, away from the glare of the Spanish sun, Virgil van Dijk thinks about words such as tension and nerves with a little smile. This is meant to be the hardest time, with the days moving slowly between the end of the regular season and Liverpool\u2019s Champions League final against Tottenham in Madrid next Saturday night. Van Dijk was named PFA player of the season by his fellow professionals, after his imperious form at the heart of Liverpool\u2019s defence helped ensure his club lost just one match in a league campaign that earned them 97 points. They still finished a point behind Manchester City, and their wait to win the league title rolls over into a 30th year. Victory over Spurs, and becoming champions of Europe for a sixth time, would seal a remarkable season for Van Dijk and Liverpool with a heady gloss. Defeat, and yet more disappointment after losing the final last year, would be crushing. The contrast between the two outcomes is so deep that even a man as composed as Van Dijk must be churning on the inside? \u201cNo,\u201d the 27-year-old insists. \u201cI\u2019m never nervous any more.\u201d That \u201cany more\u201d is significant because it is striking to hear Van Dijk reflect on the doubts that once undermined him. In the Netherlands he was regarded as a relatively limited player by numerous coaches who did not imagine his rise to become, arguably, the best defender in the world. The road has been long and difficult but, out of adversity, Van Dijk is as calm during a fevered match as he is off the pitch. \u201cWith experience,\u201d he says, \u201cthe nervousness is not there. When I made my debut for Liverpool against Everton [in January 2018] I was more excited than nervous. I surprised myself that day with my calm.\u201d Apart from scoring the winning goal in front of the Kop, Van Dijk put an immediate dent in the pressure that could have consumed him after he arrived at Anfield as the world\u2019s most expensive defender. The \u00a375m paid to Southampton now looks like prudent housekeeping. Van Dijk has transformed Liverpool\u2019s previously flaky defence so markedly that they conceded the fewest number of goals, 22, in the league last season. \u201cIt\u2019s more excitement than nerves these days,\u201d he continues. \u201cEven before the Champions League final last year [against Real Madrid] I was not nervous at all. I was very relaxed. I was like: \u2018Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s do this.\u2019\u201d At Liverpool\u2019s training camp near Estepona on the Costa del Sol, Van Dijk shakes his head cheerfully. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is. It\u2019s just something I\u2019ve learned over the years and it\u2019s something I\u2019m very happy about. If you\u2019re nervous you think: \u2018I don\u2019t want to make mistakes or give the ball away.\u2019 But you limit your own qualities then. Over the years I\u2019ve developed the mindset that there are many more important things in life.\u201d Van Dijk remembers dreaming about playing in a Champions League final when he was a boy in Breda with a Dutch father and a mother from Suriname. Yet on the Cruyff Courts, small pitches made of artificial grass, Van Dijk was not a glittering link in the conveyor belt of Dutch footballers following Johan Cruyff \u2013 who played and coached the game so beautifully. He found a different route to the gifted young players from Ajax whom he now captains with the Netherlands and who came so close to reaching the Champions League final themselves. Van Dijk is also different to Trent Alexander-Arnold, his Liverpool teammate playing a second Champions League final at the age of 20. When Van Dijk was 20 he was struggling to make the first team at Groningen, having never cracked it at the academy of Willem II. He had even worked as a dishwasher two nights a week. Was his resolve forged during that difficult time? \u201cYeah. I think it\u2019s a very good example to never give up. Keep working for your dreams. Every step of my career was hard work. I\u2019ve given everything I\u2019ve got but I\u2019ve still got more to come in every aspect of my game. Maybe they were right at the time. Maybe it was meant to be that they didn\u2019t want to take a chance with me. As a young player in the academy for a mid-table club the next step is one of the top four teams. That was my plan as well \u2013 but it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Marc Overmars was offered a chance to sign Van Dijk for Ajax but he rejected the defender. \u201cThese things happen,\u201d Van Dijk says diplomatically. \u201cThey chose Mike van der Hoorn who plays for Swansea now. He did very well at the time. It\u2019s easy to say now: \u2018What if?\u2019\u201d Van Dijk was not serene then. \u201cNo. I wanted things very quickly. When I went to Groningen I started in the under-23s and I was on the bench. I was like: \u2018What\u2019s going on here?\u2019 I went to the manager Dick Lukkien and I was arguing with him back and forth, saying: \u2018How is this possible?\u2019 But I learned so much from that period. I grew as a human being. \u201cIt was the first time I was on my own and I had to learn to deal with not getting my way. I went to training on a bicycle. It was the same the next season. Luckily, I kept working hard, kept improving, and I\u2019m still in contact with Dick who is the head coach of FC Emmen now. He\u2019s a fantastic coach and got the best out of me. He pushed me because he knew I could be a bit lazy. He knew my mentality then was to do just enough to win challenges. He kept pushing me and made me angry at times. It was tough but it worked. Before the end of the season I made my debut in the first team. I\u2019m so grateful to Dick.\u201d In 2011 Van Dijk spent two weeks in hospital after his appendix burst and he developed severe peritonitis. His life was briefly in danger. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d he says quietly. Yet Van Dijk is gracious and, after a pause, he does talk. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t simple. It was a period that I looked after myself for the first time in my life. I couldn\u2019t cook. I lived with another player and if you\u2019re that young you think it\u2019s easy. We just had training. We\u2019re not going to try and cook. We\u2019re going somewhere to eat. After I ate so much rubbish, the appendix was affected. I kept eating bad things. The appendix burst, and it was a very tough time. I learned so much about food and that we should value every situation we are in.\u201d He could not walk for 10 days and apparently signed a will to leave the little he had to his mother. \u201cWhen something like that happens you think a lot and today I appreciate everything we\u2019ve got. I know that life is much more than football. We have family and it\u2019s all about being happy and healthy.\u201d Van Dijk played 62 games for Groningen but his career took off when he moved to Celtic. He laughs when asked about the change of culture in Glasgow. \u201cIt was massive. I spoke quite good English but the Scottish accent is totally different. I remember in the beginning people were talking and I was just nodding and saying yes. But going to Celtic was fantastic for me even if it was the same situation I had in Holland. [Bigger] clubs doubted my ability because they thought the standard was not so high in Scotland. I kept working hard and I always believed in myself. And the fans at Celtic are amazing. They live and die for their club. That\u2019s something I love \u2013 real fans, real passion. It\u2019s why I also made the decision to come to Liverpool.\u201d He might be immune to nerves but, earlier this month, Van Dijk could not control his racing mind or the adrenaline coursing through him all night after Liverpool beat Barcelona 4-0 to reach the Champions League final. \u201cI could not sleep much \u2013 maybe two hours. It was totally crazy. From the moment we arrived at the stadium you had the feeling it could be something special. When Divock Origi scored that early goal you could feel the belief. Everything was perfect that night. It wasn\u2019t like we had luck. We totally deserved it because anyone would say a team 3-0 down against Barcelona is not going to do it. Messi\u2019s going to score \u2013 and if they scored one it was almost impossible. But we did it.\u201d Van Dijk grins as he relives the most glorious memory of his career. \u201cIt was nuts. You can\u2019t really describe it. Hopefully we can finish it off now and make an even bigger memory.\u201d Spurs produced an even more dramatic comeback against Ajax the following night. They were 3-0 behind on aggregate when a Lucas Moura hat-trick, capped by a winning goal in the 96th minute, left Van Dijk\u2019s young teammates in the Dutch national side crumpled on the turf. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it either but I told them later they could be very proud of themselves. If you\u2019re very critical you can say Ajax gave it away in the second half because they didn\u2019t play their own game. But they were outstanding this whole campaign and put Ajax and Dutch football back on the map.\u201d Spurs were almost dead and buried in the group stage, with one point from three games, and came through an astonishing quarter-final where they knocked out Manchester City. Their fans can be excused for churning out the old cliche about their name being on the cup while benefiting from the fact that Liverpool are surely under more pressure to win a trophy. \u201cLiverpool is always about pressure,\u201d he responds, \u201cbut we have to enjoy it. We have a good chance of winning but this is a massive game for them as well. They\u2019ve shown that they also never give up. We need to be ready.\u201d Liverpool beat Spurs 2-1 in both league games this season but their most recent encounter at Anfield was fraught with tension. At 1-1, with five minutes left, Van Dijk had to deal with the twin threat of Son Heung-min and Moussa Sissoko bearing down on goal. Sissoko had the ball but the dynamic Son was screaming down the right into space. With magisterial judgment, Van Dijk concentrated on closing down Son while allowing Sissoko to power forward. With his option of passing to Son blocked by Van Dijk, Sissoko shifted on to his weaker left foot. Knowing he had negated the presence of the more deadly Son, Van Dijk ran at the Spurs midfielder. Sissoko rushed and shot wildly over the bar. Liverpool breathed again and a few minutes later Anfield went ballistic when a Toby Alderweireld own goal won them the match. \u201cIt worked out,\u201d Van Dijk says of the decisions that meant he prevented a goal without even making a tackle. \u201cBut it would not have looked so smart if Sissoko had scored. But as a centre-back you get better with experience.\u201d Such moments meant Van Dijk was voted player of the season. \u201cI was very proud to win the PFA trophy because usually an attacker or a midfielder wins it. In later years I will look back and be even more proud.\u201d As for his own vote, Van Dijk was split. \u201cI was thinking Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva. Bernardo is outstanding and he\u2019s a great guy. I chatted with him a couple of times. He\u2019s going to be very important for City the next few years. But Raheem made a big step and that\u2019s why I voted for him. I could\u2019ve voted for another four or five players at City because they were outstanding. But they could\u2019ve voted for four or five of our players too. Maybe Trent, Sadio [Man\u00e9], Gini [Wijnaldum] \u2026\u201d He has been with his wife, Rike, \u201csince the Groningen days [when he was 20]. The growth we\u2019ve been through since then is great and we now have two little girls. You can\u2019t deny that fatherhood changes you. There are always tough moments but when you go home to your wife and kids it\u2019s all gone. For example when we lost to Barcelona you feel bad \u2013 but you go home and you think how far I\u2019ve got. I deal with those aspects very well.\u201d Van Dijk does a lot of charity work, which he asks the football writers on Merseyside to play down. \u201cI\u2019d rather just be normal. When I can help people, I will definitely help. Rike is very keen so we do it now and then. Low-key is better. We work with the foundation in Liverpool. We\u2019re helping families. We\u2019re also ambassadors of an orphanage in Nepal. Sometimes it\u2019s small things. Signing boots, inviting someone to a game in our box. Something very small for us is a very big gesture to others. We appreciate that but we like people not to think we\u2019re better than them. We\u2019re all the same.\u201d There cannot be equality at the end of a Champions League final and for the losers the pain will be harsh. Will it feel especially hard for Liverpool if their stupendous season leaves them without a trophy? \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt if you lose \u2013 but it\u2019s not the end of the world. The only thing we can do is to give everything and have no regrets if they\u2019re the better team. We\u2019re not thinking about losing or how we\u2019re going to overcome this barrier of losing the Premier League by one point, then losing the Champions League. That\u2019s not worth thinking about. I\u2019m thinking about playing to our best ability with all our talent and experience. \u201cI read that if we win the Champions League our next two [out of three] games are the Community Shield and European Super Cup. We can win three cups in three games. It\u2019s something we strive for. We were close in the Premier League \u2013 but now we have a chance to win the Champions League, the big one. We\u2019re going to give it everything we\u2019ve got.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
