We also acknowledge the grief and pain of their relatives. \"The future will not be found in denying collective failures and mistakes or closing minds and hearts to the plight of those who have been hurt. That includes all of the victims of the conflict, combatants and non-combatants. \"It will not be achieved by creating a hierarchy of victims in which some are deemed more or less worthy than others. \"The process of conflict resolution requires the equal acknowledgement of the grief and loss of others. On this anniversary, we are endeavouring to fulfil this responsibility to those we have hurt. \"The IRA is committed unequivocally to the search for freedom, justice and peace in Ireland. We remain totally committed to the peace process and to dealing with the challenges and difficulties which this presents. This includes the acceptance of past mistakes and of the hurt and pain we have caused to others.\" The statement is signed \"P O'Neill, Irish Republican Publicity Bureau, Dublin.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
