We start by looking back over the action from Group D, where England's predictably tedious 1-1 draw with France was overshadowed by Ukraine's fine win over Sweden. Next, Barney Ronay stops partying for long enough to tell us about his sightings of Alan Shearer and Stuart Pearce, and we play a game of 'Partidge or Richardson?' - coming soon to a little-watched cable channel near you. Finally, we look forward to tomorrow's games, including Poland's rather tasty clash with Russia. Barry Glendenning, Rob Smyth and Jonathan Wilson are on the show tomorrow, and there's a paper review headed your way too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
