Lyon on Monday celebrated his 30th birthday with a series of remarkable and seemingly pre-planned potshots at the tourists before the first Test begins at the Gabba on Thursday, saying England were frightened from No1 to No11 of Johnson\u2019s barrage in 2013 and claiming how \u201cI was at leg slip and I nearly had to push a couple of the guys back towards the stumps\u201d. He also stated that Australia again hope to end careers, just as they did on the 2013\u201114 tour, and talked about that victory as one of his \u201cfondest series\u201d, adding \u201cseeing Mitchell Johnson scare all the Poms was unbelievable\u201d. Root, who played club cricket in Adelaide with Lyon before either had graduated to the international game, will be watched particularly closely by Australia after he endured a tough first Ashes tour four years ago. \u201cRoot got dropped last time [in Sydney] when he was here, so it\u2019d be good to get him dropped again, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d Lyon added. \u201cIf we can start by opening up that crack, it\u2019s pretty crucial. There\u2019s a lot of scars for the English guys, especially coming over here, especially when we have two guys bowling 150kph, not just one now. \u201cI don\u2019t want Joe to go out there and say: \u2018Mate, there you go, here\u2019s a hundred today.\u2019 I want to take his wicket. I want to put him under pressure. Test-match cricket is about being resilient and, if you can bounce back from your lows, you will have some highs.\u201d Curiously the other player Lyon took particularly aggressive aim at was Matt Prior, the former England wicketkeeper who was dropped after the third Test on the last tour and played only four more to end what had hitherto been a superb career containing three Ashes series wins. \u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievable feeling,\u201d said Lyon, \u201cknowing that they are broken. Leading into Perth we knew that they were broken, we knew Matt Prior wanted to fly home before the game started and he was one of the senior players.\u201d Prior, who retired in the summer of 2015, was quick to retort to the barbs. \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely laughable. If that was the case and I was scared, why didn\u2019t I go home then? I have no idea where this has come from. Of all the things he could have come up with? That\u2019s completely ridiculous and all I can do is laugh. It is wholeheartedly untrue.\u201d Lyon is one of only three players remaining in the Australia side from that whitewash of four years ago and he sees it as his role to speak to younger colleagues about the pressures and pleasures of a home Ashes series. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been sitting around talking to a lot of the younger fellas who haven\u2019t played an Ashes about the excitement around the series, what it\u2019s like from the media point of view, the pressures from the fans and your family. It\u2019s incredible. It\u2019s the pinnacle for an Australian cricketer to play against the English at home, and hopefully recreate some history.\u201d Lyon appears to have picked up the mantle of rabble-rouser-in-chief. He says England will be subject to an even more hostile attack this time, with Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins quicker than Johnson, and \u201cthe best bowler in the world\u201d, Josh Hazlewood, hammering away at the other end. \u201cTo have two guys bowling that fast, I know especially on my birthday I\u2019m not getting in the nets this afternoon to face them because they are bowling way too quick for my liking,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are class bowlers. In the nets they are definitely quicker [than Johnson]. I saw Steve Smith land on his backside the other day, Johnson didn\u2019t do that.\u201d Lyon also believes that Root and his England team-mates will underestimate his spin, and look to hit him out of the attack out of necessity, because of the fast bowlers\u2019 class. It is no coincidence that Lyon has crept his way to the top of Australia\u2019s finger-spinning charts \u2013 with 269 wickets in 69 Tests. He is a class operator whom England would be unwise to take lightly. \u201cDefinitely [people underestimate me]. Ask Joe Root, he definitely does,\u201d Lyon added. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the game being a tiny little off-spinner who bowls at 86kph, not 150. I love being the underdog, I love flying under the radar and the challenges that lie ahead. \u201cMy partnership with Mitch Johnson at the Gabba [in 2013-14] \u2026 where we took six for nine and broke the spine of the English there and then, on the second day of the Ashes series \u2026 my role is crucial. I know my role, I\u2019m excited by it. I know they will target me. They did in England, they\u2019ve done it before and I\u2019m looking forward to that challenge.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
