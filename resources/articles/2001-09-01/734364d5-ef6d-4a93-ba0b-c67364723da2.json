But when markets fall, investors can count themselves lucky to end up with small beer. In May, Jobs &amp; Money warned that high return split level investment trusts, often sold on the promise of 10% income with the return of capital, were heading for problems. Now figures from stockbrokers Cazenove show that some highly engineered funds seem certain to lose investors money. The assets in BFS Absolute Return income share, for example, need to grow by 17.9% a year over its remaining three year life to return its present 64p share price. Aberdeen's European Growth &amp; Income must now overcome a 19.9% average annual growth or \"hurdle\" rate to return the current 41p share price. And the assets behind the \"ordinary income shares\" of Gart more Split Capital Opportunity need to rise 33% over each of the next three years to ensure no loss on the present share value. Proponents of the trusts point to hopes for a longer term market bounce and to net incomes often in excess of 15% as compensation. Those high dividends can be illusory, however, representing an accounting \"sleight of hand\" where costs are charged to capital, leaving a more impressive income. Some trusts may never reach maturity. Our warning in May focused on \"barbell\" trusts where returns are geared via bank loans. And if underlying assets erode, the banks can call in loans, leaving investors to share a few worthless crumbs. The bank money gears up the return - the idea is you borrow at 7% and buy assets gaining 10% or more. That works when share prices are rising. Once prices fall, trusts have to sell shares to ensure the loan is covered. Banks can call in loans when assets fall, typically by 35%, according to Cazenove. But the trusts can fall faster than the market because many invest in each other. These incestuous cross-holdings, said Cazenove in July, \"could lead to a downward spiral where other funds would breach their banking covenants.\" Two months on with further falls, that warning is even more true. Trusts in this position may now have to renegotiate their bank deals. But that could involve paying higher interest, or handing over part of future gains to lenders."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
