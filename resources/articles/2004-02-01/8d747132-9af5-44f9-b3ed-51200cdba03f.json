And since you obviously enjoy forcing the Knowledge's flabby frame into the waxy, primary-coloured fabric creation that is our extra-strength anorak, Everton's 15 trophies come in the shape of nine league titles (1890-91, 1914-15, 1927-28, 1931-32, 1938-39, 1962-63, 1969-70, 1984-85 and 1986-87), five FA Cups (1905-06, 1932-33, 1965-66, 1983-84 and 1994-95) and one European Cup Winners' Cup in 1984-85. Liverpool's 38 major trophies were detailed last week. But London cheekily calls upon all available resources - even Wimbledon and QPR are getting in on the act - and just nudges ahead with 56. Seven London clubs have major trophies to their name, with Arsenal London's highest achievers on 25. They have won the 12 league titles (1930-31, 1932-33, 1933-34, 1934-35, 1937-38, 1947-48, 1952-53, 1970-71, 1988-89, 1990-91, 1997-98 and 2001-02), nine FA Cups (1929-30, 1935-36, 1949-50, 1970-71, 1979-80, 1992-93, 1997-98, 2001-02 and 2002-03), two League Cups (1986-87 and 1992-93) and two European trophies (the UEFA Cup in 1969-70 and the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1993-94). Chipping in with 16 major trophies are arch-rivals Tottenham, with two league titles (1950-51 and1960-61), eight FA Cups (1900-01, 1920-21, 1960-61, 1961-62, 1966-67, 1980-81, 1981-82 and 1990-91), three League Cups (1970-71, 1972-73 and 1998-99) and three European trophies (two UEFA Cups in 1971-72 and 1983-84 and one European Cup Winners' Cup in 1962-63). Nouveau riche West-side irritants Chelsea have eight major trophies. Their one league title came way back in 1954-55, but they also have three FA Cup wins (1969-70, 1996-97 and 1999-2000), two League Cups (1964-65 and 1997-98), and two European trophies (both in the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970-71 and 1997-98). West Ham have won four trophies (the FA Cup three times in 1963-64, 1974-75 and 1979-80, and the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1964-65). Then the one-hit wonders: Wimbledon won the FA Cup in 1987-88, Charlton won it in 1946-47, and QPR won the League Cup in 1966-67. Manchester sits in an honourable third place on 38 with Manchester City adding nine major trophies to United's 29. Their wins have come in the league twice (in 1936-37 and 1967-68), the FA Cup four times (in 1903-04, 1933-34, 1955-56 and 1968-69), the League Cup twice (in 1969-70 and 1975-76) and the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1969-70. Mark Parsonage also wanted to know how England's top footballing city compares with others around Europe, but frankly the Knowledge is getting rather sweaty under all this allegedly breathable plastic, so it's time to fall back on the trusty (and scientifically valid, ahem) guestimate method. Moscow and Glasgow look likely candidates to us, though this is a notion which will clearly prompt numerous emails smugly informing us that in fact we have forgotten some backwater capital or other. All gratefully received at knowledge@theguardian.com. WHICH PREMIERSHIP KEEPER HAS CONCEDED THE MOST GOALS? \"Inspired by David Seaman's retirement,\" asks James Wicks, \"which Premiership goalkeeper has conceded the most goals?\" Given his penchant for staggering drunkenly backwards flailing his arms in the face of flighted balls from the corner flag or Ronaldinho's distant foot, it's a shame that we can't report that Safehands is top of the list. The man and his ponytail trail in a mere 7th, an achievement we can only put down to the solid Arsenal defence he spent most of his career cowering behind. Which is something Tottenham goalkeepers will know little about, perhaps explaining why two of our top three in this infamous list have put in years of their 'best' work at White Hart Lane. Floppy-haired fan-baiter Ian Walker is our No 1 having conceded a colossal 422 goals since the inception of the Premier League in 1992, not helped of course by his recent move to equally generous Leicester City. David James follows closely behind on 384 (divided between Liverpool, Aston Villa, West Ham and now Manchester City), with Neil Sullivan third on 362 after spending his years at Wimbledon, Tottenham and now Chelsea. Tim Flowers blunders in at No 5 with 354 goals conceded, closely followed by Nigel Martyn on 340. Kevin Pressman features with the slightly more respectable 311, while Seaman nips under the 300 mark at 295. Good thing he retired when he did. Peter Schmeichel manages to retain his 'legend' prefix thanks to a quiet appearance at eight with 289 stops not made, while Paul Jones had already notched up 288. Neville Southall eases into tenth with 281 mistakes under his belt. Did Bruce Grobbelaar really only concede 98? More questions! Now! knowledge@theguardian.com MULTIPLE MANAGERS \"Bromley [Ryman South Division One] will soon be on their fifth manager of the season,\" counts Alasdair McAlley on the fingers of one hand. \"Stuart McIntyre resigned after two years with the club in October. Then the assistant manager Eddie Saunders took control until the beginning of December when he was sacked for not winning in five matches. Next up was trigger happy chairman Jerry Dolke (and player John Myatt) who had a stab at managing the side until December 20th, when Alan Walker was named as the new manager. He lasted just four games and was given the flick after a 3-1 defeat in the New Year. I've never heard or seen anything like it.\" Well, Alasdair you clearly don't follow the fortunes of Atletico Madrid too closely, for their fans have been putting up with similar for years. When one wiseacre joked that there are over three million unemployed in Spain and over half of them are former Atletico managers, he wasn't too far from the truth. At the heart of it all is infamous jailbird president Jesus Gil, a maverick who bears more than a passing resemblance to the love child of Happy Days' Howard Cunningham and Al Delvecchio. His approach to hiring and firing saw five different managers at the Vicente Calderon in five months in the late Eighties. \"Appointing a coach means no more to me than ordering a glass of sherry,\" he once said. \"I don't care if I have to try 100 glasses a year to find the right one.\" One man who does care is Brazilian Joaquin Peiro - who was sacked before the start of the season because Gil did not like the look of him in the official team photograph. And in the 1993-94 season, Atletico were headed by six different managers. First through the doors was Jair Pereira, only appointed that summer, who was sacked in October. Cacho Heredia and Emilio Cruz then lasted two months each; Jose Romero one month; Santos Ovejero arrived in March and left in...you guessed it, March. And finally Jorge d'Alessandro managed to steer Atletico through to the end of the season. For the record, Atletico finished that season comfortably away from danger in 12th place, suggesting the changes were more a matter of Gil's flighty ways than necessity. Can you top this? knowledge@theguardian.com SUBSTITUTIONS TO THE LETTER \"On Saturday Bolton substituted Giannakopoulos for Ba. Is this the longest name substitution for the shortest ever?\" asks Brendan Lyons. \"If Dutch striker extraordinaire Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink has ever been substituted for anyone I think it would break the record,\" says Ian Green. \"And just because I can't be bothered finding out I surely deserve credit for spelling his name correctly.\" Yes Ian, well done for that classic cut and paste action. PSV aren't really big on short names, with stars likes Remco Van Der Schaaf and Dennis Rommedahl, so Jan's 20 letters could only be replaced by a still too large five, in the form of, say, Colin or Faber. That said, the difference between the two would be 15, a bigger gulf than the 12 letters between Giannakopoulos and Ba. What we can't decide is which deserves the record. What we do know is they both make bloody expensive shirts. There must be some lengthier monikered chaps out there. Email knowledge@theguardian.com. Can you help? \"When a player comes on as a sub they have their boots and studs checked by the fourth official, presumably to make sure they haven't got powered rocket boots on or something like that,\" speculates Matt Brown. \"Has a player in the top flight or international game ever been refused entry to the field of play due to failing the studs test?\" \"On a friend's recent trip to the UK, he purchased a Chelsea supporters scarf for me,\" says Paolo Pasquini from Canada, twinned with Kensington. \"After close examination, I noticed that at each end of the scarf, just inside the tassels, two crossed flags on poles are present. The flags look identical to the French national flag. Can someone tell me what these flags represent? It can't be the French flag, can it?\" Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
