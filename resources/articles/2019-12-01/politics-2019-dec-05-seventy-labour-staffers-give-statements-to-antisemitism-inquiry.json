The final submissions on behalf of the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM) to the inquiry, which were leaked to the media on Thursday, include 70 sworn testimonies from current and former staffers, and concludes that \u201cthe Labour party is no longer a safe space for Jewish people\u201d. \u201cIt is plain that the party does not consider the race and religion of Judaism to be a characteristic worthy of protection,\u201d it says. \u201cThis is a very dangerous place to be.\u201d In the overarching submission from the JLM, there are detailed allegations of antisemitic abuse at party meetings and by members online, including: One respondent who listed 22 examples of antisemitic abuse at party meetings where he was called \u201cchild killer\u201d, \u201cZio scum\u201d, and \u201cTory Jew\u201d as well as being told \u201cHitler was right\u201d and that he was \u201cgood with money\u201d. Another who witnessed a comment at a ward meeting that \u201cthe only reason we have prostitutes in Seven Sisters is because of the Jews\u201d. One member reported that other members defended an individual when they said it was \u201cover-representation of Jews in the capitalist ruling class that gives the Israel-Zionist lobby its power\u201d. A parliamentary candidate who described a councillor being told by a fellow member to go home and count their money after being deselected. A speaker at a fringe event at the 2017 Labour conference asserting the right to discuss whether the Holocaust happened. One respondent reported that the membership secretary in South Tottenham, north London, objected to 25 applications for membership from the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, and required home visits to these prospective members\u2019 houses. The submission also alleges political interference in the disciplinary process by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office, despite Labour\u2019s insistence that the leadership has not got involved. In particular, it claims that any separation between the leader\u2019s office and the party\u2019s complaints unit broke down in August 2018 and a staffer was instructed via WhatsApp to upload complaints on to USB sticks for leader\u2019s office employees to examine and make recommendations for future action. The submission says it was a \u201cfrequent occurrence\u201d for leader\u2019s office staff to ask to be copied in on complaints and make recommendations on sanctions. It also claims that a former employee from Corbyn\u2019s office said a narrative had taken hold among staffers that complaints about antisemitism were part of a \u201cJewish conspiracy\u201d against the leadership. A Labour party spokeswoman strongly disputed the allegations. She said: \u201cAny former staff would not know how our procedures currently work, after significant reforms, and former MPs\u2019 staff or others who have not worked on disciplinary procedures would not have knowledge of those procedures or the numbers of cases. \u201cThis document includes baseless assumptions about current staff\u2019s workload and the untrue allegations about outstanding cases. The Labour party is not institutionally antisemitic and complaints relate to a small minority of our members. \u201cWe have significantly reformed our procedures over the past year, including recently adopting a proposal by Jeremy Corbyn for rapid expulsions, which allows individuals to be expelled within a matter of weeks in open and shut cases.\u201d The party stressed that antisemitism was an \u201cevil\u201d that it was committed to rooting out, and said it was fully cooperating with the EHRC. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Thursday, James Libson, a lawyer representing the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM) and a partner at the law firm Mishcon de Reya, said interference in cases had become institutional. \u201cInstitutional in the sense that people affiliated with the leader\u2019s office \u2013 and now in the actual unit that are investigating \u2013 and that at a more basic level, information is passing between the leader\u2019s office and investigating unit,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cPassed by USB sticks, by WhatsApp groups, secret WhatsApp groups.\u201d When asked whether Corbyn\u2019s assertion that every case of antisemitism had been dealt with was incorrect, Libson replied: \u201cVery much so.\u201d He said: \u201cThere are many, many outstanding complaints, many examples of interference and many examples of double standards in the way in which complaints are processed.\u201d Labour denies there is a backlog of antisemitism complaints, but it has not released an updated figure for how many are ongoing. Its case to the EHRC will be that no allegations amount to unlawful acts by the Labour party and there is therefore no basis for the claim that there could be a finding of institutional racism. Speaking at a press conference organised to respond to the leak of the document, Sam Matthews, Labour\u2019s former head of complaints, said there had first been an influx of reports of antisemitism in the party during Corbyn\u2019s second leadership campaign. Referring to the account of Jewish people\u2019s membership applications being questioned in South Tottenham, he said: \u201cRevelations about how Jeremy\u2019s closest aides act are not surprising to me because I witnessed it first-hand for years, but the thing that stuck out to me and made me quite upset is the way in which that culture that we are talking about is empowering people across the country at a local level to think that that is OK inside the Labour party.\u201d He added: \u201cThere will inevitably be a concerted campaign to try and dismiss this as a politically motivated smear against Jeremy or against the current leadership or against a certain type pf politics, and I would implore anybody reading this document to come at it with fresh eyes and to engage with it with their conscience plugged in as they think about how they\u2019re voting next week.\u201d The JLM source said the organisation did not know where the leak had come from and that a wide group of people had seen the document last week after it was submitted. \u201cIt could have come from EHRC, members of JLM or from the lawyers,\u201d they said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know who.\u201d On Tuesday, Corbyn apologised for antisemitic incidents that involved Labour members and said he was dealing with the issue. \u201cObviously I\u2019m very sorry for what has happened,\u201d he said after being asked to apologise directly in an interview on ITV\u2019s This Morning programme. On Thursday, the shadow housing secretary, John Healey, insisted Labour had \u201ctoughened up\u201d its approach to tackling antisemitism. He told Today: \u201cHaving been too slow and too weak at the start, the action being taken now has been toughened up. An in-house lawyer, special appeal panels to deal with complaints, new fast-track expulsion powers that are being used. I\u2019m confident that cases coming in are being dealt with and if they are coming in they will be dealt with.\u201d Healey apologised to the Jewish community, who he said \u201cfeel let down\u201d by the way Labour had handled cases of antisemitism in the party."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
