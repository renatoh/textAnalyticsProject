Dos Santos joins Ipswich on loan", "bodyText": "One minute you're playing for Barcelona, the next you find yourself turning out for Ipswich Town. One of Juande Ramos's heralded summer signings for Tottenham, Giovani Dos Santos, has joined Ipswich on loan until the end of the season, an embarrassing step for a player who engendered so much optimism upon his arrival. The current Spurs manager Harry Redknapp has been trying to disassociate himself from the work of his predecessor, Ramos, for as long as he has been in the job, and this move could be interpreted as such. Dos Santos came to White Hart Lane from Barcelona in a \u00a34.7million deal, armed with a reputation as one of football's up-and-coming young stars, but the Mexican has failed to make any sort of positive impact during his time in north London. An extended jaunt to a club in the Championship, having featured for a team who reached the semi-finals of the Champions League last year, will be a humiliating descent for the Mexican striker. He has made just 12 appearances for Spurs this season, and his only goal for the club came in their Uefa Cup exit at the hands of Shakhtar Donetsk in the round of 32. He has also struggled with an ankle injury since November, which has understandably curtailed his progress. Alongside Bojan Krkic, Dos Santos was one of Barcelona's great hopes, and had been trumpeted as a potential replacement for Ronaldinho, and there was reported interest from both Chelsea and Internazionale before Spurs sealed what was regarded as a coup at the time. However Dos Santos failed to settle, and as Spurs made a terrible start to the season, picking up just two points from their opening eight games, Ramos found himself sacked and replaced by Redknapp who was unwilling to find a place for the youngster in his team. He now has a barely believable chance to revive his career in the unfamiliar surroundings of Portman Road. He will go straight into the Ipswich squad for their match at Reading tomorrow. Meanwhile another young Tottenham midfielder, Adel Taarabt, has joined another Championship club, Queens Park Rangers, on loan until the summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
