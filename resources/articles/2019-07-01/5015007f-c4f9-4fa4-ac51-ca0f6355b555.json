The report, released Wednesday by the University Network for Human Rights (UNHR), provides residents with the most detailed and comprehensive evidence to date that they are at an especially pronounced risk of cancer and other negative health effects due to toxic chemicals in the air. Reserve is the focus of a year-long Guardian series, Cancer Town, chronicling the fight for clean air in the predominantly black town, as well as other communities in the area between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, often referred to as Cancer Alley due to a concentration of toxic pollution from petrochemical factories. The toxic emissions in Reserve, a town in St John the Baptist parish, primarily come from the Pontchartrain Works facility, the only place in America to manufacture the synthetic rubber neoprene. The US government considers chloroprene, the primary constituent of neoprene, as likely to be carcinogenic to humans. Researchers found that 10.5% of survey respondents in the area immediately surrounding the plant had experienced a cancer diagnosis \u2013 even when they removed households with frequent cigarette smokers from the analysis \u2013 a rate they describe as \u201cextremely improbable\u201d. The report determined that a typical US population made up of the same race, sex and age composition as the one surveyed would experience an average diagnosis rate of 7%, and the likelihood of it being as high as it is simply by chance is a minuscule 0.37%. \u201cThe findings are disturbing, and they highlight that there is need for much more study of the health status of people living in Cancer Alley,\u201d said lead researcher Ruhan Nagra. Researchers also separated their findings into two zones, a circle including those homes closest to the plant, and an outer ring of households farther away. Those in the zone closest to the plant experienced an even higher rate \u2013 12.4%. \u201cIt supports the local people\u2019s suspicions that this plant was at the root cause of the poisoning of our community,\u201d said Robert Taylor, a local resident who has been organizing to fight emissions levels since 2014. \u201cThe closer you are to the plant, the sicker you are.\u201d The plant\u2019s operator, a US subsidiary of the Japanese chemical company Denka, as well as the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ), have consistently argued the community in Reserve are in no immediate danger due to emissions from the Pontchartrain Works emissions. Denka Performance Elastomers (DPE) spokesman Jim Harris told the Guardian that the company could not comment on the specifics of the report because they were not provided a copy in advance of its publication, but cast doubt on its reliability. \u201cFrom what we have learned, the study appears to be based on individual interviews rather than scientific analysis of actual cancer incidences,\u201d Harris said. \u201cFortunately, there is a neutral state body that does compile and analyze information on cancer incidence, and has for many years \u2013 the Louisiana Tumor Registry. The Tumor Registry\u2019s scientific analysis has for years shown that there is no historical or current increase in cancers thought to be associated with chloroprene in the census tracts bordering the facility. In fact, rates near the facility are even significantly lower in some cases.\u201d The registry, in its most recent report, stated that the term Cancer Alley \u201chas no scientific validity\u201d. Nagra called their reports \u201cnotoriously incomplete\u201d, adding that the registry itself \u201cadmits that they don\u2019t collect the type of data needed to determine the existence of associations between industry and cancer\u201d. A representative from the registry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The UNHR study relied instead on responses to a door-to-door health impacts survey of more than 500 households within a 2.5km radius of the plant conducted in March 2018. The analysis compared the real-world survey findings against a computer simulation of a population with the same race, sex and age demographics. \u201cFor every resident in our survey sample, we had a corresponding resident \u2013 of the same race, sex and age \u2013 in our simulated population,\u201d researchers said. The simulated resident was then assigned as either having been diagnosed with cancer or not, based on data from the National Cancer Institute. Researchers ran the simulation 10,000 times to generate a distribution of possible outcomes for a community with similar demographics. The methods were developed by epidemiology and statistics experts at Stanford University and, according to Nagra, were done conservatively, largely because they were \u201caware of the pushback from industry against these types of studies\u201d. Beyond cancer, the report also offered residents their most conclusive look yet at the prevalence of the other symptoms associated with chloroprene exposure, which include: chest pains, heart palpitations, rapid heartbeat, wheezing, difficulty breathing and rashes on the skin. Since there is no national-level data on how often people experience most of these symptoms, researchers compared the results of residents closest to the plant with those from people who lived farther away. In every single case, there were significantly more symptoms reported in the closer zone. For residents like Lydia Gerrard, who has long dealt with skin irritation and rashes, the research represents confirmation of what she had long suspected about her decades of exposure to chloroprene while living in Reserve. Gerrard\u2019s husband died from kidney cancer in 2018, and sitting for an interview with the researchers for this study was one of the last things he did before he passed. \u201cI\u2019m more than sure \u2013 that\u2019s where it probably came from,\u201d he told researchers, speaking about the connection between his cancer and the plant, \u201cbecause that\u2019s one of the cancers that\u2019s been associated with chloroprene.\u201d Before the full release of the report, Nagra, along with Taylor and Gerrard, traveled to Tokyo, Japan, to present their findings to DPE\u2019s parent company. Nagra said the company responded with \u201cutter defiance\u201d and declined to take a meeting with their envoy. DPE has made efforts to bring down emissions levels in recent years, having recently hit a targeted 85% reduction, thanks almost entirely to the installation of new emission control technology. The amount of chloroprene in the air still regularly exceeds the 0.2 \u03bcg/m3 that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says is acceptable, however. Nagra sees this report as all the more reason why the company ought to be held rigidly to that standard. \u201cEighty-five percent of what it was in 2014 \u2013 that\u2019s just not good enough,\u201d Nagra said. \u201cEmissions have got to come down to the EPA guidelines. So this is not a radical position. It\u2019s just it\u2019s self-evident.\u201d The Guardian, in collaboration with the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, will be hosting a series of events on the Cancer Town series in New Orleans and Reserve on 26 and 27 July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
