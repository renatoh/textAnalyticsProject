It is a glorious place of deep clear water, of white and yellow lilies and cool shade scooped by the willows from the sunlit grass and reed. Yet into this English river idyll is blended a whiff of industrial dereliction, via the tangy note of bitumen coated thickly over the cut ends of pine trunks that were laid crosswise years ago along the sleepers. If I peer over the side I can see thousand tiny holes drilled over the decades by some species of solitary wasp. Today, however, their yellow-banded occupants are not my goal. Nor is it the grass snake sidewinding smoothly through the beck. (Somehow one always watches that tiny head, and its yoke of yellow around the neck, all lifted marginally above the water's surface, and miss the whipcord of black-banded green that lashes behind.) What I'm after is the most beautiful of all Claxton's dragonflies, an insect more lovely even than its name, the banded demoiselle. As two males chase and fight, they go skittering over the water, each with four wings caught helicopter-wise in the brilliant sunlight, as two interlocking hemispheres of brittle blue-green. Then when they land they become something neither Faberg\u00e9 nor Cartier could even conjure in their dreams: a scintillation of turquoise, those blackberry-black eyes bulging on stalks, those fantastical blue-gauzed wings and all of it the more precious for being so transient. It is the sort of creature that, come winter, I can hardly believe could exist."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
