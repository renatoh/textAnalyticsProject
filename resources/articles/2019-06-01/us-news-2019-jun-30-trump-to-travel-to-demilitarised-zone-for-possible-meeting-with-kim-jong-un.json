The apparently impromptu meeting came about after Trump tweeted an invitation to Kim on Saturday from the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan. After shaking hands with Kim in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas and walking with him over the border, Trump said: \u201cStepping across that line is a great honour. Great progress has been made, great friendships have been made and this has been, in particular, a great friendship.\u201d Following a trilateral meeting between Kim, Trump and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, Trump later said he agreed with Kim to restart talks after nuclear negotiations stalled earlier this year and had invited him to the US \u201cwhen the time is right\u201d. Trump said he and Kim were \u201cnot looking for speed. We\u2019re looking to get it right.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are going to have teams, they are going to meet over the next weeks, they are going to start a process and we will see what happens.\u201d He said sanctions would remain in place, but suggested Washington might be willing to offer concessions in return for piecemeal North Korean moves towards denuclearisation \u2013 an approach it had previously rejected. \u201cAt some point during the negotiation things can happen,\u201d he said. Kim said the meeting at the heavily armed border, which was originally supposed to be a brief exchange of pleasantries but lasted almost an hour, was symbolic of warming ties between the US and North Korea. \u201cI think meeting here, two countries that have a hostile past, we are showcasing to the world that we have a new present and we have a positive meeting going forward,\u201d he said. The main source of tension appeared to be between US reporters and North Korean security guards. The jostling seen outside when Kim and Trump met worsened when North Korean guards tried to physically prevent reporters with the US press pool from entering a room inside the Freedom House on the southern side of the DMZ where the two leaders were about to start their meeting. Reports said the Secret Service had to intervene. Those roughed up in the scuffle included the new White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, who ended up with bruises. Earlier, in the South Korean capital, Seoul, Trump said he was \u201clooking forward to [the meeting] very much \u2026 He understands me and I think I maybe understand him.\u201d \u201cWe have a very good relationship, the two of us,\u201d he added, referring to Kim. \u201cI want to say hello. Let\u2019s see what happens \u2026 It will be very short but that\u2019s OK. A handshake means a lot.\u201d Moon said ahead of the talks that even a handshake and brief encounter between Trump and Kim \u201cwould be a significant milestone in the peace process on the Korean peninsula\u201d. He said he could \u201creally feel that the flower of peace was truly blossoming on the Korean peninsula\u201d. Moon later told a joint press conference he was \u201coverwhelmed\u201d with emotion about the meeting at the border village of Panmunjom. He described Trump and Kim as \u201cso brave\u201d, adding: \u201cI hope President Trump will go down in history as the president who achieves peace on the Korean peninsula.\u201d Trump said at the G20 in Osaka on Saturday that he would have \u201cno problem\u201d stepping into North Korea with Kim. In 2018 Kim had invited Moon to walk over the military demarcation line that forms the border between the Koreas. Trump is the first sitting US president to step across the border, and the gesture represents a public relations coup for Kim, who has held summits with Trump, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in the past year. Trump and Kim first met in Singapore last year in a blaze of publicity \u2013 the first encounter between a leader of nuclear-armed North Korea and a sitting US president. The two countries\u2019 forces and their allies fought each other to a stalemate in the 1950-53 Korean war. The Singapore summit produced a vaguely worded pledge about denuclearisation, but a second meeting in Hanoi in Vietnam in February broke up abruptly without agreement. Contact between the two sides has since been minimal, with Pyongyang issuing frequent criticisms of the US position, but the two leaders have exchanged a series of letters. The 2.5-mile-wide DMZ, which runs for 150 miles, is where the frontline lay when the Korean war ended in 1953, with a ceasefire rather than a peace treaty. It is described as the world\u2019s last cold war frontier. Trump claimed before he crossed the border that both North and South Korea had benefited from his attempts to engage Kim since he became president. \u201cNorth Korea and South Korea are both in much better places than they were two and a half years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s day and night.\u201d \u201cLots of good things are happening with North Korea,\u201d he told South Korean business leaders, repeating his belief that the US \u201cwould have been at war with North Korea\u201d if someone else had been elected to the White House. However, Robert Kelly of South Korea\u2019s Pusan National University derided Trump\u2019s invitation to Kim as \u201cemblematic of why the Trump NK effort is a farce: thrown together; last-minute; made for TV\u201d. It was driven by Trump\u2019s \u201clust for optics and drama rather than substance\u201d and \u201ca photo op for the 2020 election\u201d, he tweeted. But John Delury of Yonsei University in Seoul said a meeting in the \u201cbarren no man\u2019s land that embodies the unhealed wound of post-WWII division, the Korean war, and 70 years of animosity\u201d would help improve ties. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about denuclearisation and it\u2019s not all about a deal \u2013 important as those are,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Trump and Kim meet and can announce some kind of interim agreement, that\u2019s great. If they meet and don\u2019t, that\u2019s OK too. If in the end they don\u2019t meet, it\u2019s good that Trump offered to.\u201d James Clapper, the US Director of National Intelligence under Barack Obama, said he did not believe the meeting would yield progress in talks. \u201cI personally don\u2019t believe the North Koreans have long term any intent to denuclearise,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWhy should they? It\u2019s their ticket to survival and they\u2019re just not going to do that.\u201d On Sunday morning, Trump also hailed the trade talks with Xi at the G20 in Japan on Saturday as having gone \u201cfar better than expected\u201d and vowed to hold off on further tariffs as negotiations with China continued. \u201cThe quality of the transaction is far more important to me than speed. I am in no hurry, but things look very good!\u201d Trump tweeted on Sunday. The economic ceasefire halting damaging trade frictions came after the highly anticipated meeting between the two leaders of on the sidelines of the G20 summit. Washington confirmed it would not impose any further tariffs on Beijing\u2019s exports. On Sunday Trump reiterated that China had agreed to buy \u201clarge amounts of agricultural products from our great farmers\u201d. \u201cImportantly, we have opened up negotiations again with China as our relationship with them continues to be a very good one,\u201d he tweeted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
