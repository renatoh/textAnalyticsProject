A joint investigation by the Guardian and El Pa\u00eds has revealed that the speaker of the Catalan regional parliament, Roger Torrent and at least two other pro-independence supporters were told they were targeted last year in what experts said was a \u201cpossible case of domestic political espionage\u201d in Europe. According to a US lawsuit, the spyware exploited a previous vulnerability in WhatsApp software that would have given the operator potential access to everything on the target\u2019s mobile phone \u2013 including emails, text messages and photographs. It could also have turned on the phone\u2019s recorder and camera, turning it into a listening device. Torrent, who was warned about the targeting by researchers working with WhatsApp, said it seemed clear the \u201cSpanish state\u201d was behind the alleged attack on his phone, and that he believed it had most likely occurred without any judicial authority. WhatsApp believes the attacks occurred over a two week period in April to May 2019, when a total of 1,400 of its users were allegedly targeted by the \u2018Pegasus\u2019 spyware sold by the Israeli company NSO Group. The popular messaging app claims more than 100 members of civil society, including journalists in India, human rights activists in Morocco, diplomats, and senior government officials, are alleged to have been affected. WhatsApp has launched a lawsuit against NSO Group in the US. NSO Group insists its spyware is only sold to government clients for the purpose of tracking down terrorists and other criminals. It has said it has no independent knowledge of how those clients, which in the past have reportedly included Saudi Arabia and Mexico, use its hacking software. Until now, it has not been suggested that any European country used NSO Group\u2019s software in the 2019 attacks. But in an interview, Torrent expressed dismay that he may have been surveilled by the Spanish state. \u201cIt seems wrong that politicians are being spied on in a democracy with the rule of law,\u201d Torrent said. \u201cIt also seems to me to be immoral for a huge amount of public money to be spent on buying software that can be used as a tool for the persecution of political dissidents.\u201d The Guardian and El Pa\u00eds contacted several Spanish authorities for comment. Spain\u2019s National Intelligence Centre (CNI) said in a statement that it acts \u201cin full accordance with the legal system, and with absolute respect for the applicable laws\u201d and that its work is overseen by Spain\u2019s supreme court. It did not respond to specific questions about the alleged use of NSO Group spyware. In addition to Torrent, researchers at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto Munk School \u2013 who collaborated with WhatsApp after the alleged hacking attempts were discovered \u2013 alerted two other pro-independence individuals last year that they had been targeted. One, Anna Gabriel, is a former regional MP for the far-left, anti-capitalist Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP), who is currently living in Switzerland after fleeing Spain because of her alleged involvement in organising the illegal Catalan referendum. Her lawyer said in a statement that Gabriel received notice last year from Citizen Lab that her phone had been targeted. Another target, Jordi Domingo, received a notice from WhatsApp that his phone had been targeted. Although Domingo is an activist who supports Catalan independence, he said in an interview that he did not consider himself to be a key figure and that he believed the true target of the attempted hack may have been a prominent lawyer who shares his name and helped to draft the Catalan constitution. In a statement, the Spanish prime minister\u2019s office said: \u201cThe government has no evidence that the speaker of the Catalan parliament, Roger Torrent, the former MP Anna Gabriel and the activist Jordi Domingo have been the targets of hacking via their mobiles. \u201cFurthermore, we must state that any operation involving a mobile phone is always conducted in accordance with the relevant judicial authorisation.\u201d John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab who has closely monitored the use of NSO Group\u2019s spyware and collaborated with WhatsApp to engage members of civil society targeted by the the 2019 attack, confirmed \u2013 with Torrent\u2019s permission \u2013 that Torrent had been targeted using NSO\u2019s spyware. \u201cGiven the nature of this attack and the limited information collected by WhatsApp on its users, we can confirm that the telephone was targeted. However, additional investigation would be necessary to confirm that the phone was hacked. At this time we have no reason to believe that it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Scott-Railton said in an interview. He added: \u201cThis case is extremely troubling because it suggests that possible domestic political espionage was taking place. And certainly we look forward to continuing to investigate the targeting that happened in Spain.\u201d In US court filings in response to claims by WhatsApp, NSO Group has denied allegations that it bore any responsibility in the targeting of individuals and said it did not operate the technology itself. \u201cGovernment customers do that, making all decisions about how to use the technology,\u201d NSO said in its legal filing. \u201cIf anyone installed Pegasus on any alleged \u201ctarget devices\u201d it was not [the] defendants [NSO Group]. It would have been an agency of a sovereign government.\u201d Asked to comment on this story, NSO Group said it operated under \u201cindustry leading governance policies\u201d and that it could not confirm or deny which authorities use its technology because of confidentiality constraints. \u201cOnce again speculative comments from CitizenLab only serve to highlight its continued, naive and ulterior agenda which fails to competently address the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies,\u201d an NSO Group spokesperson said. The spokesperson added: \u201cWe do however appreciate your bringing this issue to our attention. In line with our human rights policy we take our responsibilities seriously and if warranted, will initiate an investigation.\u201d The news is expected to send shockwaves across Spain and the European Union, and will raise questions about whether the spyware was deployed legally against a senior political leader. Torrent said he would seek an investigation. He also confirmed that he observed \u201csuspicious behaviour\u201d on his mobile phone in 2019 and earlier, including the disappearance of WhatsApp messages. Citizen Lab said in a memo to Torrent that this suspicious activity suggested his phone had been successfully infected. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty serious matter for everyone; any democrat should feel very uncomfortable over news like this,\u201d Torrent said, adding that one of the most progressive government in Spain\u2019s history needed to ask itself \u201cwhether this case will serve to put an end to the dirty war\u201d. Mathias Vermeulen, a Brussels-based public policy director of AWO, a new data rights agency, said the story would resonate in Brussels, where privacy has been at the centre of the policy agenda for a decade. \u201cWhile there is quite some hesitation from the European institutions and member states to get involved in domestic struggles over political power, if these allegations point in the direction of the Spanish state, then I think we are entering a whole new level of controversy within Brussels,\u201d he said. \u201cSome member states with a more authoritarian past \u2013 like Germany \u2013 are sensitive to any allegations of surveillance of political opponents. It brings back some of the darker periods of Europe\u2019s history.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
