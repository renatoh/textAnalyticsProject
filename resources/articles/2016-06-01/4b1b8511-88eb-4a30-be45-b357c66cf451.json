About a third of employers in the retail sector intend to restrict the number of new jobs as higher pay packets for the lowest-paid staff eat into profit levels and cut dividend payouts. A survey of 2,100 employers by the recruitment firm Manpower found that retailers were the most likely to claw back the costs of the living wage, which came into effect in April, as they consider advertising new jobs over the next three months. James Hick, a spokesman for Manpower, said the national living wage, which pays \u00a37.20 an hour to 25-year-olds and over, has prompted retailers to register the biggest fall in optimism about their hiring intentions since 2011. Hick said the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the referendum was also deterring employers from advertising new jobs, a situation that will only get worse if the UK leaves the EU. The report found the UK would be \u201ccritically short\u201d of workers if EU workers were no longer able to move freely to this country. Leaving the EU would be particularly damaging for top construction firms, which traditionally rely on European workers, and have been warning for months of skills shortages, said the report. Hick said: \u201cBritain added 404,000 jobs in the last 12 months alone, and despite the uncertainties of Brexit, employers tell us they still need more workers. \u201cMake no mistake about the vital contribution EU workers make to Britain. There are currently 2.2 million people from the EU working in the UK, but not all of them will stay here in the long term and we need the opportunity to replace the skills they bring. \u201cBritain today is a magnet for international talent, from finance to tech to the NHS. Leaving the EU will make it much more difficult to attract the brightest and best.\u201d Employers in the West Midlands and Wales were most positive about taking on new staff, while the least optimistic were in Yorkshire and Humberside."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
