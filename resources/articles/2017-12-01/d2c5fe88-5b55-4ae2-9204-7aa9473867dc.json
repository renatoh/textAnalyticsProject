The Matildas had arrived triumphantly back on home shores, having swept aside USA, Brazil and Japan at the inaugural Tournament of Nations. In Penrith, and then Newcastle, they appeared to a heroes\u2019 welcome, with record home crowds waiting to greet their newfound champions. In the Pepper Stadium crowd, a male fan, Richard Cuthbert, was spotted sporting a Socceroos jersey with Lucas Neill\u2019s name crossed out and replaced in tape with \u201cKerr\u201d. Cuthbert had also added a \u20180\u2019 to Neill\u2019s No2 to make Kerr\u2019s No20. The image of this glorious gendered role reversal made its way to Kerr via Twitter, where she retweeted it, eventually tracking Cuthbert down to gift him her own jersey at the next game in Newcastle. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to find this guy,\u2019 not thinking that anything would come of it, just showing how cool it was,\u201d Kerr tells Guardian Australia at the end of a hugely successful year. \u201c[But] someone got a hold of it and sorted it out. I got to meet him and give him tickets to the game. \u201cHe said he couldn\u2019t buy the Matildas jersey with my name on it, that\u2019s why he did it. It was a really cool moment for both of us, I think.\u201d There is no descriptor too hyperbolic for the year the 24-year-old has had. 2017 will go down as the year Kerr earned the kind of wider recognition very few female footballers have achieved. Some have even touted her as the best in the world \u2013 a claim clearly in the ballpark after she was named in the women\u2019s world team of the year in mid-December. Earlier in the month she also added the title of Asian footballer of the year to a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 chock full of such accolades. When put to her that no less than 91 countries voted for her spot in the world team, Kerr is characteristically humble. \u201cI don\u2019t love talking about myself,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cBut it\u2019s obviously a huge honour. I didn\u2019t know 91 countries had voted. I\u2019ve heard most people are pretty happy with the team, which is quite unusual in the women\u2019s game when there\u2019s a vote.\u201d Kerr was embroiled in a voting controversy of her own this year, missing out on the three-person shortlist for Fifa women\u2019s player of the year. The omission drew no shortage of negative press; beating Kerr was a teenage student who had not represented her country at senior level. But despite outrage from fans and team-mates on social media, Kerr says the oversight did not faze her. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to be in the top three, and I think that\u2019s why it didn\u2019t bother me so much,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen so many people angry at the system, so I wasn\u2019t going to hold my breath. Once you get excited, that\u2019s when you get disappointed. \u201cBut honestly, it just motivates me more. I don\u2019t think people respect the Matildas enough and there\u2019s so many of our players who could be in contention for world player of the year \u2013 so it just motivates all of us, really.\u201d Kerr is acutely aware of what an incredible year it has been for the Matildas, both in terms of their achievements on-field, and the unforeseen levels of public attention they have garnered off it. \u201cOnce we won the Tournament of Nations, most of us went back to our clubs in Europe and the USA, and Staj [Alen Stajcic] told us, watch ticket numbers go up, and after we beat the USA, they went up a ton [for our club games]. But no one really realised how big the change was until we got back to Australia. I\u2019d never seen so many media requests and fans at our games. \u201cI think when we got back for those Penrith [and Newcastle] games we really felt the difference, and to be honest it hasn\u2019t gone back since. I hope it never does, because it\u2019s awesome to be part of.\u201d Asked if she could pinpoint what had led to the Matildas\u2019 unprecedented run of success, Kerr\u2019s answer is relatively simple. \u201cIt has been a long time coming but we\u2019ve just found the right kind of routine that works for us. It\u2019s a bit less stressful in the camp now, and I think that helps everyone, because that\u2019s the Aussie way, that kind of relaxed feel. \u201cWhen we get a bit too stressed out that\u2019s when we play bad and get a bit too nervous. At the moment we\u2019re just playing with that carefree attitude and self-confidence that\u2019s the perfect mixture.\u201d For Kerr, the Matildas\u2019 charm is quintessentially Australian; they are \u201cfiercely competitive\u201d, she says, but play as the \u201cunderdogs\u201d, with an infectious fighting spirit. \u201cWe play such a good brand of footy that Australians love to follow and support. The Matildas are household names now and you see not only young girls but young boys wearing Matildas jerseys \u2013 everyone wants to jump on board and be a Matildas fan. I think we connect with all different audiences, from young to old, male to female, which is very unusual in sport.\u201d One of the joys of an ever-increasing profile for women\u2019s sport, she says, is that the game is attracting support from even the most unlikely of sources. \u201cI had the cutest old man come up to me yesterday. He said he hates watching men\u2019s football because they dive and scream on the ground and he only watches the Matildas and the W-League, because it\u2019s just so exciting.\u201d The increasing profile of the Matildas has meant a surge in interest in the W-League, but Kerr admits that \u201cwomen\u2019s sport still has a long way to go\u201d to be treated with the reverence reserved for men\u2019s sport. In a W-League fixture for Perth Glory against the Newcastle Jets this month, for example, Kerr scored a hat-trick in just 10 minutes \u2013 but no cameras were on hand to catch the remarkable feat. They had been packed up after the A-League fixture before it, despite the game being a double header (with the men\u2019s fixture leading into the women\u2019s). \u201cThe frustrating part was that the cameras were there, and throughout the warm-up they were packing up,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could complain about it, but I think we just need to be happy for the games we have. They put on more games than they ever have this year. We have 24 games this year which is more than I think even the NWSL [American league] gets, so it\u2019s pretty cool we have the coverage we do for such a short league.\u201d Nonetheless, Kerr hopes that the days of packing up cameras may soon be over. \u201cWith the games that aren\u2019t televised doing so well, that might actually make them think, well we can\u2019t take a risk missing a game because things like that happen. Some people have said it was the game of the season so far, and it was crazy to be a part of.\u201d Despite her clear disappointment at this inequity, she is upbeat and positive about what she describes as a \u201ccrazy year to say the least\u201d. This is characteristic light-hearted Kerr, who doesn\u2019t deny having a reputation for being the team clown. \u201cI\u2019m always having a laugh, whether it\u2019s the right time or the wrong time... I\u2019ve been in trouble a few times for having a laugh at the wrong time,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of team-mate I am. I like to keep things on a lighter note. I play my best football when I\u2019m having fun and that\u2019s what it\u2019s really all about \u2013 when the emotion gets the better of me I can fade out of the game.\u201d In a statement that should serve as a forewarning to her opponents, Kerr says she hopes next year will see her take her game \u201cto another level\u201d. \u201cWhether I score less or more next year, as long as it helps the team out, that\u2019s the main thing for me. I want to win the Asian Cup with the Matildas, hopefully win the Tournament of Nations again, and put ourselves in an even better spot to be seeded at France 2019 and qualify from the Asian Cup.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
