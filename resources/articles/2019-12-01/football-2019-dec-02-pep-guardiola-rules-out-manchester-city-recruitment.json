Kompany left in the close season, while Silva will finish his City career at the end of the current campaign. Fernandinho, who is 35 in May, could also depart. \u201cDavid has confirmed he\u2019s leaving,\u201d the City manager said. \u201cFernandinho doesn\u2019t know [about his future] but it\u2019s normal. The players that arrive at his age and this stage of their lives \u2013 we have to replace them.\u201d Of the Brazil midfielder being offered a new deal, Guardiola said: \u201cTxiki Begiristain [the sporting director] \u2013 you have to ask him. I think at the end of the season we are going to decide on the situation. The players who finished their contracts, the players with full contracts: what we have to do, what we believe is the best for the club and organisation for next season.\u201d Guardiola denied a wholesale overhaul is needed. \u201cThree players is not rebuilding the team. Rebuilding the team is seven or eight, which we did in the second season when seven players finished their contract because 11 players were over 30. Buying two or three players is not rebuild, it\u2019s just substituting positions.\u201d City are third, 11 points behind Liverpool, before Tuesday\u2019s trip to Burnley. Despite the deficit and the centre-back Aymeric Laporte being in a race to recover from a serious knee injury, Guardiola will not strengthen in the winter transfer window. \u201cI don\u2019t want any players in January,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they come for an incredible opportunity in January for the next four, five, six [years] maybe we could think about it. Normally the players we could think would be interesting to add something for our squad \u2013 clubs are not going to sell them in January.\u201d City have failed to keep a clean sheet in their past seven matches. \u201cThat is not good enough. We must improve,\u201d Guardiola said but denied they were missing Kompany, now at Anderlecht, who, as captain, was a strong influence on the pitch and in the dressing room. \u201cThis group is extraordinary, the group is incredible. They take care of themselves perfectly and are an incredible unit. Vincent was an important player and person for this club but he decided to go to Belgium and we have other incredible players to do the job.\u201d Ilkay G\u00fcndogan is suspended for the visit to Turf Moor and City will miss the midfielder against a side Guardiola knows will be competitive. \u201cBurnley are an incredible team going for the second balls and not just one player, two players going to defend the strategy or the way they attack.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
