On Saturday's evidence Paul's absence was a decision without merit. He has been on the margins of international rugby since coming on as a substitute in Paris 18 months ago but the lack of familiarity with the union game, so evident then, has been replaced by an awareness to enhance his subtle skills which leaves him with few peers. As Gloucester continue their transformation into a side which prefers width, Paul's playmaking abilities in midfield ensure that James Simpson-Daniel and Marcus Garvey on the wings are more than non-paying spectators. Gloucester's second try 12 minutes into the second half summed up Paul's contribution. He made a jinking run towards the visitors' posts and after the subsequent ruck had been cleared he floated a pass that gave Jon Goodridge the space to add to his more spectacular first-half effort. Paul almost invariably made a yard or two when he had the ball. Rarely did he show the indecision of his early days and, though Goodridge was named man of the match for his two tries, Paul was the axis around which Gloucester's game revolved. He has two years to run on his contract with Gloucester but, if he remains in international isolation, will Twickenham consider it money well spent? In Wales his fellow rugby league convert Iestyn Harris is set to return to Leeds in the new year halfway through his contract with the Cardiff Blues because the Welsh Rugby Union is struggling to find half his \u00a3200,000 annual wages. \"I do not know why Henry is not in the elite squad but I personally wouldn't have had him outside the top 60 players in the country,\" said the Gloucester director of rugby Nigel Melville. \"I'm looking forward to hearing the reasons for his absence but you cannot criticise England because they are doing pretty well.\" Saracens were at their most effective when restarting play from the halfway line, Andy Goode's high, hanging drop-kicks causing problems for the Gloucester forwards with Taine Randell getting in among them, but they wasted two first-half chances directly after Gloucester had scored. The wing Nathan McAvoy lost control of the ball as he attempted to touch down and Thomas Castaign\u00e8de suffered the same indignity 13 minutes later. \"We should have been 14-13 ahead at the interval instead of trailing 13-0,\" said the Saracens coach Rod Kafer. Randell's try from a driving maul five minutes after the restart hushed the Shed but Paul then played his decisive hand and the visitors started to lose their discipline: Kris Chesney and later Ryan Peacey were sent to the sin-bin and Gloucester's final two tries came when they enjoyed a man advantage. \"Perhaps the players became frustrated after failing to take chances in the opening period,\" said Kafer, but Saracens struggled in the line-out and were shunted around in the scrums with the result that the pace of Richard Haughton on the wing was rarely glimpsed. Gloucester also looked disjointed at times but they had Paul in their midfield. England's loss is Gloucester's gain, said Melville. \"There is no limit on the number of games he can play for us and in that sense I am delighted he is not in the squad.\" For the moment.
