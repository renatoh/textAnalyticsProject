They are referred to as \"field recorders\" and are ideal for schools because they offer a truly portable means of capturing, in full stereo CD quality, concerts, band and orchestral performances, interviews, discussions, ambient sounds, sound effects and virtually every other recording scenario you can think of. They are a world away from the typical, small, monaural, tape-based dictation devices designed for interviews. So why go digital? With digital audio, the quality depends on the sampling frequency and the resolution (typically, for music CD quality, this is 44.1 kHz, encoded in 16 bits). Most of these devices sample at a maximum of 96 kHz at 24bits. They can also be preset to record at CD quality. Audio-editing programs can be used to adjust the recording level, fix recordings in which one speaker sounds louder than another, reduce unwanted background noise, filter unnecessary frequencies, silence personal or identifying information to protect anonymity, and cut extraneous sections from the beginning or end of audio files. It is also easy and inexpensive to backup and archive digital audio recordings, usually saving in .wav or .mp3 formats. Some factors to consider \u00b7 Cost (including batteries and media). It is a false economy to purchase a cheap recorder if the audio quality is poor? \u00b7 Audio quality. Should be capable of recording in mp3 as well as 44.1-48 kHz in 16-24bits. 2Gb storage media is an absolute minimum for any decent recording time. \u00b7 Ease of use. Are external microphones supported through line-in or mic-in jacks? Internal microphones are usually of low quality, and may pick up noise from the recorder. Portability may be important, as are hardiness and reliability of both recorder and media. Stereo recording must be supported. How easy is it to transfer recordings to a computer? Is USB or some other method that allows faster than real-time upload supported? Record time: how long will media and batteries allow recording to continue uninterrupted? \u00b7 Batteries. Can rechargeable batteries be used? How much control will you have over the recording process? Is the recording level displayed and is it possible to manually adjust the recording level? M-Audio Microtrack 24/96 \u00a3263 (ex VAT) The Microtrack records .wav and .mp3 files to CompactFlash (CF media) or microdrives via balanced line inputs or built-in high-fidelity microphone preamps for studio-quality microphones. Power is derived from a built-in battery - very much like an iPod - and the unit recharges via the computer's USB connection or USB power adapter. Pros: its digital inputs, 24-bit uncompressed recording mode, balanced TRS jacks and RCA jacks. Cons: its sluggish level indicators, noisy microphone pre-amp or the fixed battery. The Edirol R-09 (\u00a3234 ex VAT) The Edirol R-09 also features 24-bit recording and has a built-in stereo microphone to boot. The device is good for recording live music events, recitals, rehearsals and is handy as an audio sketchpad, ensuring that no moment of inspiration or creativity is lost. Better quality recordings are gained by plugging in an external mic via the mini-jack input socket. Pros: its built-in stereo microphone, removable AA batteries and use of Secure Digital (SD) media. Cons: its lack of balanced microphone inputs and its lack phantom power (source of power for external microphones). However, the R-09 is a reasonably serious product for the price. Samson Zoom H4 \u00a3212 (ex VAT) The Zoom is a stylish hand-held recorder that includes two built-in, studio-quality condenser microphones configured in an X/Y pattern for true stereo recording. It also features two (combo) XLR-1/4-inch input jacks with phantom power for use with any external microphones. The H4 records on to Secure Digital (SD) media, and a 128MB SD card is included with the unit. Unlike the other field recorders here, the H4 also features a 4-track recording mode. Pros: the styling, intuitive user interface and bundled Steinberg Cubase LE software (for editing sounds on your PC). Cons: the rather plastic feel and small display. All in all, though, it's easy to use and gives impressive results. The Marantz PMD660 \u00a3318 (ex VAT) The PMD660 is described as a \"miniature\", portable, solid-state, stereo pro-recorder, and it seems quite robust. It records on Compact Flash (CF) media and includes a stereo pair of microphones onboard (they do need to be used close-up to get a reasonable result). Marantz claims it can run for four hours on four AA cells. Pros: its two balanced XLR microphone inputs with full phantom power, its large input volume dial and preset recording modes, which make it easy to use. Cons: the rather \"hissy\" results with dynamic microphones. Overall, the PD-660 provides a good balance of price and features. Summary None of these devices has quite got the balance right: each is a bit of a curate's egg, and there's no overall \"winner\" for schools. It's a question of trying each out and researching what other users say. Remember, though, you will definitely need to budget for a large (2Gb) memory card and possibly an external microphone and protective case as well. Once you are set up you will want to archive all your tapes and analogue sound recordings, and that's another journey ...
