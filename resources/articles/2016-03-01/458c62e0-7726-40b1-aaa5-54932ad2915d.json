The Cheltenham Festival begins this week but that, in fact, was an inspirational quote Eddie Howe, so detailed and thorough in his preparation, delivered to his players to digest before Bournemouth brushed aside Swansea City to all but secure their Premier League status for another season. Bournemouth\u2019s supporters must be wondering whether this fairytale will ever end, with a top-half finish now well within reach. And their maiden season in the top flight has been so absorbing for Howe, forever distant from all the hyperbole and fanfare, who admits he has struggled to take it all in. \u201cThere\u2019s a satisfaction at the end you can look back and think that was a nice moment in hindsight but when you\u2019re in it, at that second, there\u2019s too much at stake to really sit back and enjoy it,\u201d said the Bournemouth manager. \u201cI don\u2019t think the pressure\u2019s ever off in football, let alone in the Premier League.\u201d The 13-point cushion between Bournemouth and the relegation zone has, though, allowed Howe to breathe relatively easy before a tricky run of matches that includes hosting Manchester City and Chelsea. Bournemouth have put in the hard graft of late and, although hypothetical, if the season started on 1 December the Cherries would sit third in the Premier League. Their third straight win also wiped away the need to rush joint top-scorer Callum Wilson back to fitness. Wilson could return from a cruciate knee injury next month, although the striker is yet to begin training with the rest of the squad. Bournemouth are doing just fine without him at the moment. Max Gradel scored his first Premier League goal and Joshua King added his second in as many matches to twice put the Cherries in front against Swansea, who levelled before Steve Cook\u2019s late winning header. Gradel\u2019s last goal for the club came during a loan spell against Millwall in 2008 and it has been some journey for Bournemouth since. \u201cIt is crazy,\u201d said Gradel, who dedicated his strike to Howe (below). \u201cHe has always been here for me. When I was on loan here I had a hard time. He was there when I lost my mother. If people are good for you, then you have to give something back to them.\u201d Francesco Guidolin, who will return to the dugout against Aston Villa on Saturday after a lung infection, will not have been overly enamoured with Lukasz Fabianski\u2019s goalkeeping for Bournemouth\u2019s first goal that snuck inside the near post. Swansea\u2019s first-team coach Alan Curtis, who again led the team in the absence of the Italian, said it would be a topic of discussion at Swansea\u2019s Fairwood training ground on Monday. The visitors were sloppy at key times but one overwhelming positive was the performance of the Gambia winger Modou Barrow, who lit up an otherwise indifferent away performance. Barrow\u2019s relentless energy went some way to compensate for the missing Andr\u00e9 Ayew, who is expected to return against Stoke next month after receiving treatment in France. Swansea remain eight points clear of the relegation zone but Curtis said it would be dangerous to consider them safe. \u201cI would love to have 38 points,\u201d he said, looking up the table at Bournemouth. \u201cWe need to get something from every game. We\u2019re not only looking for safety, we\u2019re looking to get as high as we possibly can, but safety has got to be the priority now, which means that the pressure now goes on to Saturday.\u201d Man of the match Modou Barrow (Swansea)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
