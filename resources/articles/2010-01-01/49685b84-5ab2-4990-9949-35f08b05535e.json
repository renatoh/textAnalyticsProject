He's from north London, the son of an Italian dad and a British mum who apparently owned an album collection that included the likes of Zeppelin and Tony Joe White, just two of the influences on this technically impressive and varied set. Bonfanto is a wildly versatile guitarist who can handle almost anything in the electric-, country- or folk-blues field, and the songs here range from stomping blues that echo Jimmy Page through to delicate acoustic finger-picking on songs such as Sweet Louise. Then there's a furious rapid-fire blues rock instrumental, Tweed Blazer, and some sturdy vocal work and impressive harmonica playing on God Only Knows. So what's missing? Bonfanti's songs often sound as if he's copying someone else and his lyrics are, at best, forgettable. When he discovers a distinctive musical identity that matches his guitar skills, he really will be a star. RD"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
