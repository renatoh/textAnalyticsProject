They have been traumatised this season by the cut-throat professionalism of Manchester United and Chelsea, losing home and away to both in the Premier League. Yet as Wednesday's storm eventually abated at around the hour mark, with Bar\u00e7a having added two second-half goals, something extraordinary happened, something to galvanise not only Walcott, in what has been a frustrating season for him, but also the whole club. In front of the watching England manager Fabio Capello, Walcott came on in the 66th minute and, almost immediately, he had embarrassed Maxwell, the stand-in left-back, to claw Arsenal back to 2\u20111. It was Walcott's third goal of the season. The crowd were energised and, rather abruptly, Barcelona looked mortal, their defenders distinctly so. Having suffocated Arsenal with their pressing game, they began to huff and puff. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger delved into Japanese to describe the penalty that his team won for the equaliser. The Swiss referee Massimo Busacca's decision was \"ma-ma\", the manager said, or \"so-so\", the strictest interpretation of the law. \"It was fantastic to come back from 2-0 down,\" Walcott said. \"A year or two ago, or even four years ago, we might have put our heads down and it would have been a different result. But the experience of the last few years, the Manchester Uniteds, showed definitely. \"Last year, the fans might have got on our backs because we didn't have a Plan B. But we have so much experience now, having had so many disappointments in recent years. I think we showed the character that we want to win something and go that one step further.\" Walcott has searched for touchstones during an injury-ravaged season and when he has seemingly found one, with performances such as that against Burnley at home last month, he has frequently been forced to confront disappointment. After that game, in which he scored and dazzled in the second half, he was returned to the bench. Only once this season has he started in back-to-back Premier League fixtures \u2013 the matches at Liverpool and Burnley in mid-December. The worry for the England player could be that Wenger's Plan B involves using him as an impact substitute. Walcott noted that Barcelona had \"died off for the last 30 minutes; playing at that sort of tempo is very hard to do for the whole game\" and his pace is precisely the sort of weapon to make capital in such situations. No player relishes being a substitute and Walcott is desperate to start the second leg of the quarter-final at Camp Nou on Tuesday, when Barcelona hope to welcome back their first-choice left-back, Eric Abidal, from injury. Andrey Arshavin, whose arrival at Arsenal has been a contributing factor in Walcott's frustrations, suffered a calf injury in the first half against Barcelona on Wednesday and will probably be out for the season. But Walcott's focus is on a more immediate challenge. \"I am not thinking about Tuesday, it is all about Saturday and the title race,\" he said. \"Wolves [at home] will be a tough game and we have got to show that we are still in the race. Every single game is a cup tie now. \"As for Barcelona, we need to play our football, get the ball down, keep it and frustrate them at times \u2013 like they did to us, especially in the first half. If we can get a goal, their fans will be right at them.\" Arsenal can draw a degree of encouragement from their Champions League last-16 tie against Milan two seasons ago. After a home draw, albeit a scoreless one, Wenger's team travelled to San Siro to record a memorable 2-0 victory. Walcott played his part. The parallel he may not appreciate, though, was that his impact came as a 71st-minute substitute."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
