Speaking on the Happy Sad Confused podcast, the film\u2019s director said that, while he noticed \u201cpushback\u201d from the previous Star Wars film, The Last Jedi, he felt \u201caggressive trolling\u201d was a crucial factor. \u201cIt was pretty interesting,\u201d Howard said. \u201cIt was especially noticeable prior to the release of the movie. Several of the algorithms, whether it was Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes, there was an inordinate push down on the \u2018Want to see\u2019 [score on Rotten Tomatoes] and on the fan voting.\u201d On its release in May 2018, Solo \u2013 a standalone \u201canthology\u201d Star Wars film filling in the backstory of Han Solo \u2013 underperformed at the box office, with a global take of $393m (\u00a3310m), well below the $1.06bn of the Franchise\u2019s previous anthology film, Rogue One, released in 2016. Industry commentators largely ascribed its failure to \u201cfranchise fatigue\u201d, with Disney CEO Bob Iger admitting the company had made a mistake in releasing Solo only six months after The Last Jedi. Review aggregator sites such as Rotten Tomatoes have been the focus of negative campaigning, with The Last Jedi targeted \u2013 as also happened with Black Panther and Ghostbusters \u2013 by trolls attempting to lower its scores. Howard said that \u201cfriends in Silicon Valley had explained\u201d to him what the pattern of voting meant. In 2019, Rotten Tomatoes announced it was adjusting its site rules after a barrage of negative comments for Captain Marvel, prior to the film\u2019s release. No user reviews are currently available on the film\u2019s Rotten Tomatoes site, while Metacritic\u2019s users rate it at 6.2, compared to 7.6 for Rogue One. \u201cI didn\u2019t take it personally,\u201d said Howard."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
