Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge and Chelmsford warned that the medieval-style cap could be a health hazard. \"It is requested that graduands do not throw the hat up into the air,\" says a statement on the website of the university, which will be hiring Cambridge's Corn Exchange and a marquee at Chelmsford for celebrations involving 3,500 students. \"This not only causes damage to the hats but it can also cause injury if the corner of the hat hits the graduand or others who may be nearby.\" The move was met with derision by Anglia Ruskin's student union, whose president, Frankie Whiffen, 23, said: \"It's like banning graduation pictures in the outdoors in case an apple or a conker, or a pigeon, falls on someone's head. They should be worried about more serious things than the chance that a group of adults can't catch a hat properly.\" The university's secretary and clerk, Steve Bennett, said they were not banning the throwing of mortarboards, but asking people to be careful. He said: \"A student had to be hospitalised after he was struck on the head by a hat several years ago.\" A spokeswoman added: \"That student's graduation was ruined and we don't want it to happen again. Someone could be blinded by a falling hat or even worse. The possible damage to hats also has to be considered. Our suppliers support our position.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
