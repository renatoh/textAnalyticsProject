After the forward Pione Sisto was criticised for driving to his home in Denmark last week despite strict government restrictions on travel, now his 30-year-old teammate Smolov is reportedly facing a fine when he returns from seeing Maria Yumasheva. \u201cThe player repeatedly requested permission to travel to Russia for a personal matter,\u201d said a club source quoted by AS. \u201cThe club could not give it to him because La Liga did not authorise it, but he promptly reported his movements and left with the commitment to return once he solved his personal affairs.\u201d Last week Smolov, who got engaged to Yumasheva in January, said he would not be allowed to return to Russia during the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cI get along well, nothing new can happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think about anything and I accept the situation.\u201d Spain is about to enter its fourth week of lockdown which has been extended until 26 April in a bid to restrict the spread of the virus, which has killed over 12,000 people in the country."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
