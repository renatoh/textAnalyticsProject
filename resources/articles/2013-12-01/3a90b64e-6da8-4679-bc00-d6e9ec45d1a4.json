The draw on Monday will have Manchester United, Real Madrid, PSG, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Dortmund, Atletico and Barcelona in the top pot, with Bayer Leverkusen, Galatasaray, Olympiakos, Manchester City, Arsenal, Schalke, Zenit and Milan in the other pot. For Manchester United and Chelsea, that is very good news. For Arsenal and Manchester City, not so much. BYE! So Napoli go out of the Champions League with 12 points, while Zenit go through with six points. Zenit progess with the lowest points tally since Milan went through with five points in 94-95 and Napoli equal PSG's dubious record of reaching 12 points but failing to progress in 97-98. That's not something that will make Rafa Benitez feel very good tonight - still he is, at least, the Europa League's defending managerial champion so there's that to play for. Group E Chelsea 12 points QUALIFY Schalke 10 points QUALIFY Basel 8 points EUROPA LEAGUE Steaua 3 points Group F Dortmund 12 points Q Arsenal 12 points Q Napoli 12 points E Marseille 0 points Group G Atletico 16 points Q Zenit 6 points Q Porto 5 points E Austria Vienna 5 points Group H Barcelona 13 points Q Milan 9 points Q Ajax 8 points E Celtic 3 points Dortmund go through from Group F as group winners, Arsenal are through as runners up. Austria Vienna get their first ever Champions League win. Zenit go through nonetheless. It's all over in Naples: Arsenal lose 2-0 but still go through. However, as it stands, they will go through as runners up. Basel go out - but, in Italy, Arsenal have just conceded again... That's the end of Porto in the Champions League - they go into the Europea League and Atletico finish the group stages unbeaten. That's the end of that at Stamford Bridge. Not a night to live long in the memory but Chelsea finish as group winners. The referee puts Celtic out of their misery in Spain. So, currently: Chelsea and Schalke, Dortmund and Arsenal, Atletico and Zenit and Barcelona and Milan are going through. As it stands... Lewandowski plays the ball to Grosskreutz, he thumps the ball into the ground. Mandanda gets a hand to it but can't keep it out of the net. That means Dortmund will go through at Napoli's expense. Samaras takes the shine off Barcelona's performance. Sort of. Lewandowski goes down in the box, the referee thinks about the penalty after Mandanda comes into contact with him \u2026 but nothing is given. GOAL... oh. Offside. Lampard plays the ball into Ba, standing what looked like about a hair offside. He swivels on the penalty spot and blasts the ball into the top corner. Nothing doing. Chelsea 1-0 Steaua Oh, Celtic. Diarra has been heroic at the back for Marseille, but Dortmund have been very wasteful. Arsenal, too, are a shambles currently so there's plenty of scope for a grand farce in Group F. Here's hoping. Corrections and clarifications dept (or the dangers of half listening to Sky Sports news): \" Much I'd as I'd love it if my team, the Glorious Glasgow Rangers, held this honour, Uefa think Celtic's greatest ever defeat was actually at the hands of ... Motherwell! True?\" reveals Ryan Dunne. Chelsea are beginning to look a little ragged, with Mourinho growling on the touchline. A Steaua goal wouldn't be a disaster for them, but wouldn't help the mood at Stamford Bridge much. \"Has anyone proffered 'Men against Bhoys' yet?\" asks Mark Gillies. Just the 20-odd of you. Arsenal's Mikel Arteta is given his marching orders. Find out what happened here. Celtic have just given up. Barcelona have another couple of efforts at goal, more for something to do. Like an unwilling cat flicking lazily at a half-dead mouse, Barcelona are taking Celtic apart with insouciant ease. Dortmund's Lewandowski latches onto an underhit Marseille backpass, takes the ball around the keeper and puts his shot into the side-netting from six yards out. A moment later, Reus blasts over the bar. Meanwhile, Higuain scores for Napoli against Arsenal. That'll put Napoli through at Dortmund's expense. That's Celtic's heaviest ever defeat, and it equals Barcelona's biggest home Champions League margin of victory. Oh dear. \"At the height of Rafa's unpopularity at the Bridge last season they announced over the tannoy that Mikel had just put pen to paper on a new 5 year contract,\" writes Ian Burch. \"Rafa must have wondered why the home crowd were more angry than normal when he walked out of the tunnel that day.\" He collects the ball 30 yards out and is urged to shoot by the crowd. He elects not to, wisely. However, he has been very slow tonight - needing too many touches and largely making little different when he does get the ball away. Dortmund are all over Marseille, but it's the home side who have had the biggest chance. Gignac nearly puts 10-man Marseille ahead against Dortmund before his side are forced to revert to full on defence mode as Lewanowski manages to miss a sitter. Should have been six for Barcelona. The ball is played over the top to Neymar and he goes around Forster but collides with Pedro, who takes the ball off him and fails to score. Hazard intercepts and breaks, racing goalwards with the ball bouncing about ahead of him. Georgievski, who can't helped but be a part of the action, races across to clear. Chelsea have been pretty ponderous in this half - passing extremely slowly. The problem might well be Mikel, who is having one of his games. Mourinho addresses this by taking Oscar off and bringing Schurrle on. Oh. \"Ten things we've learned from the CL group stage,\" emails Simon McMahon. \"Nos. 1-10: Celtic are rubbish.\" Basel, so good against Chelsea, are going down to Schalke. That's something of a shame for them - alongside Olympiakos, they were probably the best performing underdogs of the season. Neymar picks the ball up on the left, goes past one defender, puts the ball through the legs of another defender, then clips the ball into the net. Having not scored a Champions League goal since getting to Barcelona, he has now scored three in a night. Chelsea will also be pleased about that Schalke goal. If it stays the same there, that means Chelsea can afford to draw. At Stamford Bridge, Hazard runs down the left wing and is rugby tackled by the Steaua left back. Oscar, dazzled by a laser pen, hits the cross too long. Another one for Hosner as Austria Vienna step nearer that first Champions League victory. An important goal in Chelsea Group E and it means Schalke have leapfrogged Basel in the group and slot into the runners-up spot under Chelsea. Demba Ba! Willian plays a ball into the Steaua box to within six yards of the goal. Ba runs through in between two defenders and strokes the ball superlatively into the crowd away and behind the goal. He's really grasping his chance ... Well, this could be interesting*. Vienna have gone ahead against Zenit as they search for their first ever Champions League win. That means that, if Porto can beat Atletico, Porto will go through instead of Zenit. *May not be interesting. Neymar plays a pretty one-two with Pedro, then strokes the ball into the corner of the net from distance. Celtic had barely stopped sucking their half-time oranges. Hazard skedaddles up the left, pings a crossfield ball to Willian - which Lampard allows to reach him by ducking. Willian plays a delightful slide-rule pass into the box, the ball whizzing about like a pinball ... only for Ivanovic to get on the end of it and play with all the flair for which he's known. Still, it was nice until then. Chelsea are back out on the pitch first, presumably the clocks at Stamford Bridge have all been wound forward a few minutes as everyone is hoping to nip off early and beat the traffic. If things stay as they are \u2026 Group E: Chelsea will go through on top, with Basel second and Schalke into the Europa League. Group F: Arsenal will finish on top, with Dortmund going through in second. Napoli would go into the Europa League. Group G: Atletico were already winners, while Zenit are currently going through in second, with Porto into the Europa League Group H: Barcelona would top the group, with Milan in second and Ajax in the Champions League - though Milan are down to 10 men. Milan 0-0 Ajax Atletico 2-0 Porto Barcelona 3-0 Celtic Chelsea 1-0 Steaua Austria Vienna 1-1 Zenit St Petersburg Marseille 1-1 Dortmund Napoli 0-0 Arsenal Schalke 0-0 Basel It's half-time in Naples: follow that with Scott Murray here. Barcelona are on for a cricket score. They're barely having to work against Celtic and Neymar is the latest to steer the ball into the net. That's his first Champions League goal for Barcelona. Some hope for Porto? Relief for Georgievski: according to the Champions League Twitter account, Chelsea's opener has now been put down as a Ba goal. Which is a shame as, had it gone to the Steaua man, it would have meant he had scored as many Champions League goals for Chelsea as Torres and Eto'o and one more than Ba. Half time at Stamford Bridge: Chelsea 1-0 Steaua Neymar works some magic in the Celtic box, finding space, then clipping the ball to Pedro for a tap in. Worse news for Porto! Diego Costa pours more hurt on Porto who appear to be on their way out. Atletico could well be going through unbeaten. That's bad news for Porto: Zenit go ahead against Vienna and into prime position to go through as runner up in Group G. Open journalism in action: \"Atletico leads from 14th minute (Raul Garcia) and Porto just missed a penalty, Cheers, Bojan\" Steaua's Kapetanos shrugs off Terry with ease, turns and blooters a shot wide from 30 yards. Schwarzer watches it go by without raising an eyebrow. Basel's Ivanov is shown a red card for a professional foul, while Marseille's Payet gets a yellow then immediately charges into the box and takes a dive, to earn an immediate second yellow. Good work. Steaua venture into the Chelsea half and fling balls into the box. A series of shots are blocked and scrambled clear by the Chelsea defence. It looks scrappy and disorganised back there, with Mikel particularly chaotic. If Mourinho has told his players to organise their defence, then they haven't been listening. Hazard diddles around in the box for Chelsea and wins a corner. Ir's played short, to Hazard, who blazes in a vicious cross. Ivanovic gets a head to it but thumps it straight at the keeper who turns it over the bar. Willian hits another corner long and Lampard cracks a first time volley into the Kings Road. Riccardo Montolivo has been sent of for Milan for a challenge on Christian Poulsen. He gets an absolute earful from his manager Massimiliano Allegri as he goes, too. Milan down to 10 men. Ajax are just shading the match in Milan and have managed to hit the bar and had a header tucked around the post. A win for Ajax, as things stand, would mean they go through. Should they do so and should things remain as they are in Naples, this will represent a very poor Champions League campaign for Italian sides. Georgievski has had an awful time against Chelsea. Not only was he given a torrid time by Schurrle when Chelsea came to Bucharest, he also scored an own goal. He'll be delighted to have done exactly the same in this match, meaning he has now managed to score for Chelsea in both of the clubs' two meetings. Excellent work. Correction - that Marseille goal was actually scored by Souleymane Diawara. At Stamford Bridge, incidentally, Steaua very nearly scored. The first time the visitors got into the Chelsea half, they dismantled the Terry/Luiz axis and Iancu stroked a shot just wide of Schwarzer's post. Marseille haven't given up on this Champions League campaign yet. A cross comes in, keeper Weidenfeller misses it, the ball thumps into the cross bar and back out for Diawara to nod home. He might have been offside mind. Minutes before that goal - which looks increasingly like an own goal - a wag in the crowd was shining one of those pointy laser things into Jose Mourinho's eye. He ignored it, but let's stick with it ... Another corner comes in, Oscar nods it across the box and Ba bundles it into the net from a yard (though it may have been Georgievski scoring an own goal). Think we know who will claim that one. Forster makes a good save but can't get hands to the ball. It falls to Pique who buries it in the back of the net. Another corner to Chelsea, taken short for Lampard to cross in. Some hilarious defensive confusion leads to the Steaua defenders virtually ushering the ball into their own net. The ball bounces off the Steaua keeper Tatarusanu and out for another corner. It's all Chelsea. Chelsea are going to lose this, aren't they? That was quick. Lewandowski controls the ball and dinks it over Mandanda in the goal. Marseille really haven't bothered much with this Champions League campaign, have they? Corner to Chelsea, which falls to Luiz. He clobbers it wide of the post and at the the ludicrous extra official, who has to move sharpish to get out of the way. Peep peep: They've kicked off at Stamford Bridge and, indeed, at other places. Though Arsenal are still lounging about on the pitch. Follow that match here. The teams are clickety-clacking their way onto pitches around Europe. The music of Georg F Handel is getting a good airing from stadium PAs around the continent, as the man himself does a couple of his twice-weekly revolutions around his final resting place in Westminster Abbey.

There's plenty at stake in tonight's Champions League action with something to play for in all four groups. Here's a quick run down: Group E Chelsea v Steaua Schalke v Basel Chelsea are top of the group before tonight's kick-offs and are through to the knock-out stages but not as group winners. They must beat Steaua (P5 W0 D3 L3) to ensure that happens. Should Chelsea lose, then the winner of Schalke v Basel will go through as group winner, though Chelsea will still top the group should that match end as a draw. Group F Napoli v Arsenal Marseille v Dortmund Group F is very much up in the air, with none of Arsenal, Dortmund or Napoli yet through. For Arsenal, it's relatively simple: they must avoid losing by three goals or more to ensure they go through - follow that match live with Scott Murray. They will go through as group winners if they win or draw against Napoli. Dortmund face Marseille who are yet to win a game in the group stages. Victory for the German side will put them through should Napoli lose or draw. Napoli need to beat Arsenal by three goals or draw and hope Dortmund lose at Marseille. Group G Atletico Madrid v Porto Austria Vienna v Zenit St Petersburg Atletico Madrid are clear winners in Group G and are currently unbeaten, while Austria Vienna are already out. It means Porto must beat Atletico and hope Zenit cannot beat Austria Vienna if they are to go through. Group H Barcelona v Celtic Milan v Ajax Barcelona are through but not as guaranteed group winners yet. Celtic will definitely finish bottom, no matter what happens tonight. Victory for Barca will secure them the top spot, while Milan and Ajax are involved in a straight shoot-out to see who goes through, with only a win enough for the Dutch side. At least, that's what it looks like. But there's always room for a Pellegrini in there somewhere."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
