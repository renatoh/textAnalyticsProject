His parents think it may have something to do with a childhood accident, when he stuck his finger in a lamp socket. Danielle Finch's stammer is unusual \u2013 a machine-gun bleat that crops up between words and makes you blink in surprise. Julian and Danielle were two of the students of The Stuttering School, a four-day intensive course \u2013 known as the McGuire programme, and run by \"recovering stammerers\" in a hotel function room in Wales. Danielle had never been in a room full of stammerers before, and was surprised to see people struggling even more than she does with the ordinary mechanics of communication. \"For some of those it's heartbreaking to watch 'em,\" she says. \"It proper upset me.\" For the duration of the course, the students are not allowed to speak to anyone other than their instructors. Arron Fellows's engaging and sensitive short film, part of Channel 4's First Cuts strand, didn't do much to expose the mysteries of the McGuire programme \u2013 it has something to do with breathing, and the students are made to wear belts around their ribs for part of it \u2013 but the results were still impressive. Starting at a modest rate of one word per breath, the stammerers soon graduated to phone work. \"I've never left a voicemail on anybody's phone,\" said Danielle, beaming. \"Today I left about five.\" There was a bit of background delving \u2013 Julian works in his parents' bridal shop in Cardiff, which might have made a film in itself \u2013 but Stuttering School wisely concentrated on the theme of conquering fear. A stammer seems to feed on the frustration and embarrassment it causes, and both Julian and Danielle had the air of people who would in other circumstances be downright outgoing. Watching the newly confident stammerers take turns to stand in the middle of a shopping precinct and make a speech was, as you might expect, reliably moving. \"Three days ago, I could barely say my name,\" announced Julian, pausing for a cautious breath. \"Now you can't shut me up.\" Passers-by with bags in their hands stopped to shed a quiet tear, and so did I."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
