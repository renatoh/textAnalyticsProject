On a daily basis, it served up a clumpy gruel of screaming and fistfights that first defined and then accelerated the concept of the Ugly American across the world. It was a low-rent, knock-down, barroom brawl of a show that splashed around in humanity\u2019s very worst excesses. And people couldn\u2019t get enough of it. It is almost impossible now to grasp how huge The Jerry Springer Show was in its time. In a typical episode, Springer \u2013 a former mayor of Cincinnati who was born in Highgate tube station during a second world war German bombing raid \u2013 would play ringmaster to a tawdry parade of domestic disputes. In episodes with titles such as I\u2019m Pregnant by a Transsexual! and Lesbolicious, Springer would introduce a guest, hear their complaints, bring on an aggressor and watch as they verbally and physically attacked each other. Sometimes he would offer half-baked witticisms from the sidelines \u2013 \u201cBetcha can\u2019t say that 12 times in a row,\u201d he shrugged during one episode after a woman described her daughter-in-law as \u201ca bigmouth, bully, badass bitch\u201d \u2013 and other times he\u2019d step back while the audience chanted his name like they would a WWE wrestler. It seemed unstoppable. But what did for The Jerry Springer Show was Springer himself. Erudite and politically conscious in person, he repeatedly distanced himself from the show that bore his name, telling Reuters in 2000: \u201cI would never watch my show. I\u2019m not interested in it.\u201d The real nail in the coffin, though, came in 2005, when Springer came to the UK for a British spin-off entitled The Springer Show. Running on ITV in place of Trisha Goddard, The Springer Show was warmer and more subdued than its American progenitor. There was a sense that Springer had gone out of his way to inject more of his own personality into it, in a bid to stop the runaway train he had created. The show did fine, but the consensus was that it was a little boring. So ITV replaced him with Jeremy Kyle. And Jeremy Kyle killed Jerry Springer. Where Springer was wry and detached from the tawdriness of his show, Kyle seemed fully invested in it. He didn\u2019t stand at the back and crack wise; he crouched down on his stage, dripping with judgment, and openly shouted at his guests. He really meant it. Suddenly the whole talkshow shtick lost its sense of self-awareness, and whatever grain of fun it once had was flushed down the toilet for ever. Kyle was such a sensation that he eventually took his screaming villainy to the US, where his show ran for 300 episodes. Compared to this bare-knuckle confrontational style, Springer started to look even more like a clapped-out sideshow; miraculously, his show managed to lumber on until 2018 before finally sputtering out. Springer now hosts a programme called Judge Jerry, where he finally gets to flex his legal qualifications. Kyle\u2019s show was cancelled last year after the death of a former guest. You\u2019d think we\u2019d have learned lessons from this, but we probably haven\u2019t. Take care of yourself, and each other."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
