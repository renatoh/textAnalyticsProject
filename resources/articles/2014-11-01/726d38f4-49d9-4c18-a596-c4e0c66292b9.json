He will stride out into a deafening din on Tuesday, the majority within Celtic Park whipped up into a frenzy to match that which once left Barcelona\u2019s collection of World Cup winners diminished in November 2012. Back then, as Celtic\u2019s goalkeeper, he revelled in the intimidatory support. This time around he must endure it. He returns as an outsider, hopeful if slightly unsure of the reception he will be afforded at a club for whom he played 197 times before joining Southampton for \u00a310m this season. Forster is expected to start for England with Joe Hart released back to Manchester City, the younger man to earn his third cap in a chaotic atmosphere. \u201cIt would be a dream come true to play,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve only sampled the atmosphere there at club level but Bar\u00e7a came away saying it was the best they\u2019d ever played in. Given the calibre of players they\u2019ve got, that tells you how unique it is. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic stadium, quite tight but really loud. I\u2019ve lots of special memories from my time there, winning league titles and big European games, though that win over Barcelona is probably the best. It will be great to go back for the first time since I left, coming up against some close friends \u2013 Scott Brown, Charlie Mulgrew, Shaun Maloney, all top players \u2013 in a derby game, the sort you want to experience. If I\u2019m fortunate enough to play it\u2019ll be a special night.\u201d Forster\u2019s four-year spell in Glasgow, the first two seasons of which were spent on loan from Newcastle United, yielded three league titles, two Scottish Cups and those eye-catching nights in Europe. There were only nine defeats at Celtic Park along the way, four of which were inflicted by celebrated continental opposition in Bar\u00e7a, Milan, Juventus and, in the Europa League, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, with his game progressing rapidly through regular involvement and under the watchful eye of the club\u2019s goalkeeping coach, Stephen Woods. At 26, he moved to Southampton as a player approaching his pomp. His displays to date, all imposing presence and command of his area with only eight goals conceded in 14 games in all competitions, have confirmed that pedigree. There is an acceptance within the England squad that the 27-year-old Hart is very much Roy Hodgson\u2019s first choice, with good reason given his own excellent form. Ben Foster, a player who has grown frustrated at life as a back-up in the past, has acknowledged as much. \u201cHis place as No1 is cemented now,\u201d said the West Bromwich Albion player. \u201cHe\u2019s fantastic and we\u2019re happy to have him. Sure, it\u2019s frustrating at times, but you know the score. We all know our roles.\u201d Yet, in that context, opportunities such as that which awaits Forster in Glasgow must be taken. \u201cFraser\u2019s strength is his maturity really,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cHe showed that maturity at Celtic. For a young man he\u2019s had plenty of games and plenty of Champions League games. Coming to Southampton and taking part in such a successful start to the season, it does give confidence. You can\u2019t divorce the way players are feeling about themselves from their club football and, at the moment, players like Forster and Nathaniel Clyne are brimming with confidence. If he gets his chance in Scotland, he won\u2019t let us down.\u201d Perhaps the move to the Premier League was timely in terms of generating a presence that could not go ignored. It will clearly benefit Forster that he is now working on a daily basis with the England goalkeeping coach, Dave Watson, at his own club. \u201cIt\u2019s been absolutely brilliant so far,\u201d Forster said. \u201cI had a great time at Celtic and will be forever grateful for what they did for me. They gave me a chance and really believed in me. \u201cStevie Woods, the goalkeeping coach, put in a lot of time and effort and really brought me on. They gave me the opportunity to play Champions League football and European football. It was something really special and it was just a case of, in the summer, I thought it was time to move on for a new challenge. And we\u2019ve had a great start, which is a real credit to the manager and everyone connected with Southampton. \u201cWith England it\u2019s fantastic to be part of the squad. Joe\u2019s a top keeper. Ben and I know that \u2013 we see him in training every day \u2013 but we\u2019ve got a fantastic group. We work really hard and bring the best out of each other. You\u2019ve got to focus and concentrate because we all want to show what we can do.\u201d The return to Glasgow should offer a chance to do just that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
