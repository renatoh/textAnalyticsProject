It is lightly literary, compassionate, and highly book-clubbable. Sofer follows four different characters (rich gemologist Isaac; his beautiful cognac-swigging wife Farnaz; his nine-year-old daughter; and his son Parviz) through an extraordinary year which begins with Isaac's arrest by the revolutionary guards and ends in exile. Their contrasting lives highlight the ironies of the religious and political arguments which almost destroy them: while his father is in prison, Parviz falls for the devout daughter of his Hasidic landlord in New York; his mother, Farnaz, acquires new resourcefulness beneath her veil. Told at 30 years' remove, it has an elegiac softness of touch which makes its darkest prison scenes bearable and, because of the heightened contrast, the best thing in the novel. Occasionally it risks being artless, but it is never heartless, and is limpidly readable historical fiction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
