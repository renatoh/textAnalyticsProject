The League Managers Association has drawn up the code after consultation with the Premier League and the Football Association in an attempt to end abuse of the transfer market. The code, which will be enforced by the FA's compliance unit, will require managers to declare if they are related to or are represented by an agent with whom they are negotiating. Sir Alex Ferguson drew criticism recently for purchasing players represented by his son Jason. In a biography published this year it was alleged that the Manchester United manager tried to force Jonathan Greening and Mark Wilson to join his son's agency before he would sell them, accusations he denied. Both subsequently left Old Trafford for Middlesbrough but remained with their agent, Mel Stein. The authorities are also examining the possibility of requiring LMA members to reveal details of their personal finances in exceptional circumstances, although this is legally problematic. Clubs could eventually be compelled to disclose the financial details of all transfers. John Barnwell, chief executive of the LMA, said the initiative was intended to demonstrate the game was clean. \"We are looking for greater transparency and accountability and we are taking legal instruction on the draft code of conduct,\" he said. \"You might have an agent looking after you who brings you a player and that is a conflict. The proposal is that if there is a conflict of interest in a transaction then the manager must register it with the compliance unit, their club and with the LMA. \"By registering that conflict you can eliminate that doubt and give it credibility. Football is not corrupt but we want to make sure that it is as clean as it possibly can be.\" Barnwell said that key to the effectiveness of the code would be its enforcement by the compliance unit. \"We are not sure yet what the strength or remit of the compliance unit is going to be, but that will be crucial. That's a legal matter for the FA to decide upon.\" An FA spokesman said: \"We have been delighted to give our input to the code of conduct but the precise details rest with the LMA.\" The Premier League also welcomed the initiative. \"We are very supportive of any new initiative that increases transparency in the game,\" said a spokesman. Gordon Taylor, the PFA chief executive, said the LMA proposals were a useful first step but called for the establishment of an overarching monitoring body to regulate transfers. \"We believe there should be a single body comprising the FA, the Premier and Football Leagues, the LMA, the PFA and of course the agents,\" he said. \"The game will be more transparent the more bodies are involved. The key thing is to work out where the money is going and to stop it leaking away from the game.\" The code of conduct is the first of a number of measures intended to clean up the game and tackle the perception that agents are taking huge sums of money out of football. Despite the licensing of agents by Fifa and greater scrutiny of club finances the transfer system is still open to abuse. It is not uncommon for managers and the player they are buying to be represented by the same agent, or for managers and agents to be related. Phil Smith of agents First Artists, which represents Kevin Phillips and Freddie Ljungberg, said the measures were constructive. \"Anything that helps clean up the game is good. There are too many agents allowed to be licensed in this country [174] and we need quality control so the agents are concentrating on getting good deals for footballers and for football clubs.\" Steve Cuttner, who represents George Graham, said he made a point of not negotiating on behalf of both player and manager. \"When George was at Tottenham I consciously never got involved in a deal involving a player I represented. The relationship with the manager was far more important in my view. Conflicts never arose as the manager was scrupulously ethical.\" Conflicts of interest The League Managers Association code will ensure that the following conflicts of interest are declared \u00b7Agents that are representing both parties in a deal - the manager and the player they want to buy \u00b7Agents dealing with managers to whom they are related \u00b7Clubs using a single agent to conduct all purchases, including those of players who are represented by the agent"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
