A government commissioned report says that students and employers should receive the same core services from all universities. It also calls for 24-hour computer-based careers advice for students, and help for students for two years after graduating. The review of services, led by Sir Martin Harris, the vice-chancellor of Manchester University, was announced by the government six months ago following concerns that the standard of services varied enormously across the academic sector. Education and Employment Minister Tessa Blackstone, said that university careers services were too often \"a Cinderella service\", offering little help to students and academics. The report is based on one over-riding principle: where you study - and where you live after graduation - should not affect the quality of careers advice and guidance you receive. Among some 41 proposals in the Review of Higher Education Careers Services, is that the academic sector should define the core services that every careers service should provide to students and promote best practice in relation to 'statements of entitlement' for students. Diana Warwick, chief executive of Universities UK, welcomed the report, but highlighted the costs implied in some of its recommendations: \"Some proposals entail additional costs that are not explicitly recognised by the report. For example the recommendation that calls on institutions to identify early those students who will be most in need of careers services, runs the risk of laying the heaviest costs on the institutions that are most successful in implementing the access agenda and recruit people from diverse backgrounds.\" The consultation on the proposals ends on 27 April.
