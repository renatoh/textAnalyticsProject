After what seems like a long time of repression from a spell of cold weather which cut right through to the spring equinox, the songs of birds are now liberated. Blackbird, thrush, chaffinch, dunnock - all the singing birds are making up for lost time. Although they have been struggling to find their voices in the damp, bone-cold, fag end of winter which refused to shift, now they have and there is a palpable sense of relief, joy even, as the songs build towards the spring chorus to come. Even crows and ravens have crisper, lighter notes to their growling croaks which speak of a gathering excitement. But the most extraordinary song of early spring, the one which defines March and only lasts a few days, does not come from birds all. It is a strange, deep, gargling croak and comes from the pond, now churning with frogs. Having endured a few false starts, only to be frozen in the water, the warm, sunny day is the signal for the frogs' sexual festival to begin. It starts in an instant and there was no going back. Within hours, the pond is alive with a frenetic-limbed, grappling, spawn-paddling frenzy. But the song behind the action seems even more remarkable. For creatures with such small throats, the frogs really dig deep for those notes - down into the dark, cold, weedy water to pull out a rumbling sound which appears dispassionate in itself but triggers the wildest of passions. The song of frogs is much more ancient than that of birds. This strange amphibian voice is perhaps the original call, and only after millions of years of evolution did birds inherit it. But the original still exists, the true voice of spring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
