A quango it may be, but its function, roles and creative energy in representing women across race, class, age, religion and sexual orientation, not only in the UK, but also, through its partners, internationally, can never be replicated by the gender equality office, for this a government department. We have been the envy of our overseas sisters at international meetings such as the UN commission on the status of women, because, through the WNC, our voices are heard in policy negotiations at the top tables and via shadow reports compiled in consultation with all the partner women's organisations.

Eureka \u2013 millions of jobs released. Perhaps it would be a good idea to discourage young women from university entrance too. An exception could be made for girls who have attended private schools, as clearly they can afford to employ servants for the domestic chores. It's interesting ... what it isn't, is Liberal. Pat Aitchison Normanton, West Yorkshire \u2022 I feel so depressed at the thought of the lives to be blighted by the selfishness of middle-aged white men. It's these smirking millionaires who need the economics primer. Kate Green London"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
