Age: 4+ Mr Pusskins thinks life can never get better: he is adored by Emily and he adores her in return. But then Emily brings him a surprise - a kitten. But Little Whiskers is not a surprise that appeals to Mr Pusskins, and soon the cat fur is flying. How the grumpy old puss and the spirited kitten come to terms and settle into a comfortable life together is revealed with a sprightly touch in Sam Lloyd's hilarious illustrations. The Robot and the Bluebird, by David Lucas (Andersen, \u00a310.99). Age: 5+ This tender, touching and hopeful story of how a bluebird brings happiness to a rusty old robot by nesting in his heart box, empty now his own mechanical heart has broken, has a lyrical text and stylish illustrations to match. David Lucas breathes life into the robot, investing him with feeling and character while never forgetting that he is inanimate. This makes the juxtaposition of the broken tin machine with the very corporeal needs of the bluebird seeking warmth to survive especially pertinent. Against a background of changing seasons, this modern fable about the power of love to regenerate unfolds at a gentle pace and to great effect. All Pigs Are Beautiful, by Dick King-Smith, illustrated by Anita Jeram, with accompanying CD (Walker, \u00a36.99). Age: 5+ Let's hear it for pigs! Former farmer Dick King-Smith rehabilitated them to wonderful effect in his classic story The Sheep Pig. Here, in a \"nature storybook\", he pays further tribute, explaining some of reasons why he \"just loves pigs\". Having identified Monty, a large white whom he once owned, as his all-time favourite, King-Smith tells the story of Monty's life, capturing his charms, describing his feeding habits and giving the background to his and other pigs' needs, likes and dislikes. Anita Jeram's illustrations of the animals are cuddly and cute, reinforcing everything King-Smith writes. An accompanying CD adds information and a \"Perfect Piggies\" song, as well as a reading of the story."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
