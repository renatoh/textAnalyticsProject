Vermeulen beat last year's winner Marco Melandri of Italy on a Honda after coping perfectly with the tricky conditions on the 4.18km circuit. Casey Stoner of Australia steered his Ducati to third place to extend his lead at the top of the world championship standings to 21 points over Italy's Valentino Rossi. The seven-times world champion Rossi, who has been struggling all weekend, finished sixth behind Spain's Dani Pedrosa and Germany's Alex Hofmann. Rossi, starting outside the front row for the first time this season, took the lead after a couple of corners but was soon attacked by the local favourites Randy de Puniet and Sylvain Guintoli. The Kawasaki rider De Puniet took command of the race after five laps with Rossi suddenly dropping back four places. With drizzle turning into heavier rain 20 laps from the finish line, Guintoli, De Puniet and Toni Elias crashed and John Hopkins took the lead. The American made a pit-stop along with Rossi, Stoner and Pedrosa on the 10th lap to change tyres. Melandri opted not to make a change and he was soon overtaken by Vermeulen. The Australian, whose best previous result was second place in last year's Australian GP behind Melandri, never looked back. \"When I saw all those riders on the ground I just tried to keep it together,\" Vermeulen said. \"[Deciding] when to come to the pits and change tyres was the hardest part. I must admit I followed my instincts, I did not really think. Then I saw my lead increase until Marco came closer but I realised he was at the limit.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
