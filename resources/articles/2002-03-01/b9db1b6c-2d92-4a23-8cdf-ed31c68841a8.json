The author spends a darkening winter afternoon in Meadows's cottage in Deal, drinking tea and listening to stories. As the overheated room fills with anecdotes about local characters, allegedly unsolved murders and stolen bits of statues, Seabrook tries to catch every wisp of usable material. \"I sit up and shift forward,\" he writes as Meadows begins a particularly tantalising digression. \"This is what I've come to hear. As if infected by my excitement Gordon jumps up and walks past me, looking for something. He returns with a remote control which he aims at the video recorder. 'Countdown', he explains.\" Modern small-town England, and especially its suburban southeast, is a place that seems firmly resistant to quests for dark secrets. Its car parks, its roundabouts, its high streets lined with identical chain stores - any visiting writer with romantic ideas about probing this landscape would surely not persist for too many drizzly afternoons. Yet recently, as London has become an over-familiar subject for non-fiction explorations thanks to the success of Iain Sinclair and Peter Ackroyd, so this hybrid genre - part travelogue, part history, part gothic speculation - has turned its attentions outward from the capital. WG Sebald has written about Suffolk, Philip Hoare has written about Southampton, Sinclair himself is finishing a book about the M25. Now Seabrook has crept round the blustery coast of Kent from Rochester to Broadstairs via Margate with his notebook. What he finds fills the pages much better than you might imagine. Seabrook lives in the county; from the autobiographical glimpses he provides, he seems to have done so all his life. However, his book is only fleetingly interested in modern Kent, that bruised thumb of land with its asylum-seekers and troubled resorts. In Margate he sees \"hunched sedated souls lingering in cafes\"; elsewhere he notes the tense silence in pubs full of unemployed dockworkers. His contemporary descriptions are spare and vivid - a seafront bench is painted \"ketchup red\" - but they are mainly context for a deeper project. Seabrook takes four famously unsettling works of literature - The Waste Land by TS Eliot, The Mystery of Edwin Drood by Dickens, Robin Maugham's The Servant and John Buchan's The Thirty-Nine Steps - and attempts to expose their origins in real Kentish places and past events. Sometimes Seabrook's approach is that of relatively conventional biography and literary criticism. He finds a few lines about Margate Sands in The Waste Land , describes how Eliot spent a few weeks in the town in 1921 while convalescing after a nervous breakdown, and identifies the chipped Victorian pedestrian shelter, still standing on the front, where the poet wrote, watching the grey waves and the shell-shocked veterans of the world war just gone. At other times the book makes riskier connections. In Broadstairs, known for its genteel retirees, Seabrook's roving eye settles on a large white clifftop house. It has been sliced up for flats now, but there are steps nearby, suggestively leading down to a hidden beach. As he circles the house and talks to suspicious neighbours, and slips old newspaper cuttings about the property into his narrative, Seabrook gradually reveals something rather startling. During the 1930s the house was the home of Arthur Tester, the son of a British diplomat, who was also a spy for German military intelligence and a prominent supporter of the British Union of Fascists. Tester ran a company based in London called the European Press Agency, which put out anti-communist propaganda and received covert funding and support from the German government. He wore a monocle and smoked imported cigarettes. He kept a large yacht moored near the cliffs, on which he was rumoured to entertain Oswald Mosley and important German Nazis. Tester hurriedly left Britain in 1938 after questions were asked in the House of Commons about his activities. He ended up as a German army interrogator in Romania during the second world war, and was killed in Transylvania in late 1944, \"carrying a passport signed by Hitler\". All this is so perfectly sinister that it could take over the book, but Seabrook lightens his discoveries with black humour. Tester, he writes, was like \"a stage Nazi...a man they might have called in to thicken the plot of 'Allo, 'Allo.\" When John Buchan wanted some villains and a dramatic setting for the climax of The Thirty-Nine Steps , Seabrook convincingly suggests that he borrowed Tester and his Broadstairs eyrie. The chapters about Dickens and Maugham are slightly less successful. The former lingers too long and pruriently over a notorious murder in a village near Rochester in 1843, which may help fill in the blanks in Dickens' unfinished last novel. Seabrook's detective work runs away with itself, recalling the American cultural critic Greil Marcus at his most excitable and opaque. The Maugham section, meanwhile, is atmospheric about Deal's tight streets and its embattled but louche gay subculture - Seabrook describes the Carry On actor Charles Hawtrey \"reeling round town like an old wasted weasel\" - yet you wonder what it all adds up to, beyond a set of tempting shaggy-dog stories. One answer seems to be a theory, which can be sensed at work throughout the book, about the seaside as both a refuge and a dead end for unconventional Britons. Many of the characters here have turned to drink; they are recovering, or not, from defeats and fatal turning points in their lives. Seabrook himself, it becomes clear, has lost a fianc\u00e9e to cancer. His writing's acute sense of place, its restless need to make associations, its moments of feverish interior monologue - at first it all seems simply an original prose style; but then it takes on a greater emotional weight. There is empathy here, and that is rare and welcome in this kind of book. David Seabrook clearly loves Kent and its internal exiles as much as they spook him. He probably need not move house when this comes out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
