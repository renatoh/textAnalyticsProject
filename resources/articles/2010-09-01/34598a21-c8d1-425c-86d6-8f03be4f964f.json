The BBC's latest attempt to bazooka the X Factor kicked off with their secret weapon, Widdecombe being part of what co-presenter Tess Daly (what legs, but what vowels) called the \"star-stooded\" latest line-up of celebs about to dance. Bruce Forsyth made actionably smutty bad jokes, and then the gang \u2013 truly, a nice enough mix \u2013 got to meet and greet their dancing partners, and then they all danced, actually rather well. Ann confided that earlier thing with her usual honesty. It's the kind of over-direct truthfulness which makes your head rock back a little; like hearing someone say \"I have a gun\" or \"does it get any bigger, sweets?\" And, look, I'm doing it myself now, inviting in the smut. See what this show did to me? But Ann Widdecombe's honesty should have its own plinth. Oh, I wish she would win, but she won't, because she's been paired with the smugfest Anton Du Beke. Everyone else was paired with, basically, a hottie, with the male celebrities faring best. I would worry for Paul Daniels (actually very funny last night) and his sainted wife Debbie McGee, who will be sitting at home sticking pins into an effigy of dancer Ola from now until \u2026 forever. So odd old Brucie, who is obviously only going to die when his eyes get close enough together to make one eye, made terrible jokes about \"surprise packages\" and a frankly inexcusable intro which said: \"The right honourable Ann Widdecombe and the right tasty Felicity Kendall!\" Hnurr Hnurr! And then in the audience Billy Connolly, my ex-hero, was clapping like a seal while his wife, Pamela Stephenson, danced. This promises much but it makes mugs of many \u2013 not the contestants, or the dancers, but us. And the music they danced to was execrable. Perhaps Ann will say this, soon, honestly, before it begins proper on 1 Oct. Oh, Kara Tointon for the winner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
