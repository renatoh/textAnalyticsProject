The revelation emerged during the Bichard inquiry, which is investigating flaws in the vetting procedures and intelligence handling in the Huntley case. Humberside police have so far come in for the brunt of criticism. Its chief constable, David Westwood, has admitted making mistakes and today gave an emotional assurance to the parents of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman that his force would \"not be found wanting\" when it came to learning the lessons of their murders. But the key revelations from today's evidence regarded Cambridgeshire police, which has so far attracted less criticism than Humberside. The revelation that the Cambridge force had not asked for information to vet Huntley came as Mr Westwood was being cross-examined by counsel to the inquiry, James Eadie. Mr Eadie told Mr Westwood that he was not going to ask him about whether a faxed request for an intelligence check on Huntley was sent to his force by Cambridgeshire police because the chief constable of Cambridgeshire, Tom Lloyd, had accepted it was \"more likely than not that a fax was not sent by his force\". Chief Constable Lloyd is now likely to be questioned over whether a vetting request was ever sent when he gives evidence to the inquiry next week on Thursday. It is understood that he has updated his original statement to the inquiry after conceding the fax was probably not sent. It had already emerged that, even if the fax had been sent to Humberside, the force would have returned a \"no trace\" response because its records on Huntley had been deleted. In written submissions to the inquiry, HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Keith Povey said: \"In the circumstances described, HM Inspector of Constabulary remains to be convinced that the request for local intelligence checks was actually made of Humberside. However, even if they had, the quality of data held was so poor that the results of the check would have been negative.\" The inquiry originally heard there was a potential dispute between the two forces as Cambridgeshire remained adamant that a vetting request had been sent to Humberside. The Bichard inquiry is investigating flaws in the vetting procedures and intelligence handling in the case of Huntley, which gave him the all-clear to work as a school caretaker at Soham Village college despite a string of previous sex allegations. It was while working there that Huntley murdered the 10-year-old friends Holly and Jessica in August 2002. Earlier today, the inquiry heard Mr Westwood admit that information about Huntley's first contact with Humberside police, which came from an accusation of underage sex, should have been recorded on the force's database. He said officers should have been able to find out that Huntley had been investigated in relation to the first incident, developed as a suspect and that he had admitted the offence. Later Mr Westwood told the inquiry that he admitted he was \"wrong\" to argue that records on Soham killer Ian Huntley had been deleted in compliance with the Data Protection Act. Mr Westwood had attracted vilification after he read a statement in a press conference just hours after Huntley had been jailed in December last year that said the law meant data about the killer had to be erased. The statement said: \"Under the [Data Protection] Act, information cannot be retained solely for the purpose of employment vetting. To do so would be a breach of the Act. It can only be retained for a policing purpose. We therefore have to weed our systems on a regular basis. Details about our contacts with Huntley were deleted from the system in accordance with our then policy.\" Today Mr Westwood said he had misinterpreted advice given to him about the system and said he should have consulted his own data protection officer, Richard Heatley. He said: \"I could try to justify why I made a mistake. I do not intend to try to justify why I made a mistake ... It was not intended and done in all good faith.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
