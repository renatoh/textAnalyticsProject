After a video emerged of the Foreign Office minister Mark Field pushing the Greenpeace activist Janet Barker against a pillar and grabbing her by the neck, a number of his party colleagues and supporters said the anger at his behaviour was unjustified and told his critics to \u201ccalm down\u201d. The Conservative MP for Lichfield, Michael Fabricant, said colleagues were \u201crallying around\u201d Field, who was suspended as a minister on Friday. His colleague, the Reigate MP Crispin Blunt, commended Field for his actions, saying the force used was the \u201cminimum\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s called taking responsibility and leadership,\u201d he said. Johnny Mercer, the MP for Plymouth, also defended Field, tweeting: \u201cIf you think this is \u2018serious violence\u2019, you may need to recalibrate your sensitivities. Calm down, move on, and be thankful this wasn\u2019t worse.\u201d Others cited the example of the murder of Jo Cox as they argued that Field\u2019s actions were understandable because the unarmed protester may have appeared to pose a danger. Charities working to combat violence against women expressed concern over the support that Field\u2019s actions received. Karen Ingala Smith, the chief executive of Nia, an organisation that supports victims of domestic and sexual violence in east London, said: \u201cWe see how men\u2019s violence against women is explained away and reduced in crime figures and inquiries. I think this is an absolute parallel of that. It\u2019s part of the messages women get all the time about our worth, who has power and who the state is protecting.\u201d Field, the MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, said he felt threatened when the protester walked past him and was worried that she might have been armed. But Ingala Smith dismissed his response, saying: \u201cPeople are queueing up to say that she might have had a weapon. You can see her hands and arms. If you\u2019re going to go and attack someone, that\u2019s not how you enter a room.\u201d Mandu Reid, leader of the Women\u2019s Equality party, said the video made for \u201cdisturbing viewing\u201d and called for Field to lose his seat. \u201cAnything less amounts to apologism for violence against women,\u201d she said. \u201cFor many women, it will have been a visceral experience both terrifying and yet familiar, because male violence against women is endemic and too many women have experienced first-hand the indignant fury we all witnessed in Field\u2019s behaviour.\u201d Field has referred himself to the Cabinet Office and the Conservative party, both of which are investigating the incident. Police are also investigating third-party reports of assault made against Field, who has since apologised to the protester. A spokeswoman for Theresa May confirmed that she had seen the footage, saying the prime minister found it \u201cvery concerning\u201d. However, the spokeswoman refused to be drawn on whether it was inappropriate for MPs to defend the actions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
