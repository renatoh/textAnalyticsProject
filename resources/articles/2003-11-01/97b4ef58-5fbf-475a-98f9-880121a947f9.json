The fires, fanned by strong winds, gutted 12 of the 15 luxury tents at Longitude 131, the award-winning safari camp which opened in June last year, and later forced the temporary evacuation of Ayers Rock Resort, which was undamaged. The national park was closed for a day but reopened as the flames were extinguished after temperatures dropped. Voyages Hotels &amp; Resorts plans to rebuild Longitude 131 by next March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
