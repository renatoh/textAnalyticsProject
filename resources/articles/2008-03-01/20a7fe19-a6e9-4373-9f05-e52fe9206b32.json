His blood pressure will not stand another three or four months of this, and he might just have seen his best chance of another Treble disappear over the horizon as well. The United manager was on his feet practically the whole game, turning various shades of purple at perceived refereeing injustices and ultimately at his own team's inability to convert pressure and chances into goals. As Portsmouth barely had a shot until the late penalty that put them into the semi-finals this must rank as one of the greatest of FA Cup shocks. Pompey have not won at Old Trafford in over half a century. You could get 10-1 odds on an away win for Harry Redknapp's team and some of us did. It was never a safe bet though, even with United down to 10 men with Rio Ferdinand in goal. To say Portsmouth rode their luck would be understating the case by the length of the Manchester Ship Canal. United were denied a clear penalty in the first half, saw two certain goals blocked by astonishing interventions from defenders on the line, not to mention the Patrice Evra shot that David James touched on to a post, and had enough close-range opportunities to win a dozen cup ties. Portsmouth came with a simple plan - not to concede early and to frustrate their opponents for as long as possible - and ended up shattering Ferguson's sunny optimism. 'Of course we rode our luck, we were up against a fantastic side,' Redknapp acknowledged. 'United are different class, we came here six weeks ago and got slaughtered. It was the draw no one wanted and Alex didn't exactly rest anyone either, it was pretty much the full monty we were up against. When I saw the teamsheet I must admit I was stuck for words. I usually tell the lads they are the best in the world, but I'm not sure they believe me. I'm not sure what to believe myself now. Perhaps I've been right all along, or perhaps I'm an idiot. We did have a plan this time, though, and we stuck to it.' Portmouth had offered to bring tickets for a possible replay up to Manchester, but United said not to bother. That motivated Redknapp's players to an extent though the key to this result was United's 2-0 victory over Portsmouth in the League in January. Both goals were scored inside 13 minutes, and by Redknapp's own admission United might have ended up with 10. Pompey were helped by some lacklustre United attacking play that must have had Ferguson momentarily reviewing the advantages of retirement. Only joking. Ferguson would be happier if Keith Hackett retired instead. 'He's not doing his job properly,' Ferguson fumed about the referees' supervisor. 'The referee's performance today was unacceptable, but he'll be doing it again next week. Don't even ask me why Ronaldo didn't get a penalty, I cannot explain that decision and I don't think anybody could.' Ferguson later calmed down to the extent of accepting that United had missed too many chances, and that Portsmouth were entitled to play in the way they had. Though he failed to mention Wayne Rooney's booking for the most dangerous tackle of the afternoon, he did have a point about Martin Atkinson's refereeing, certainly over the penalty controversy in the seventh minute. Four minutes earlier Lassana Diarra had barged Cristiano Ronaldo over the touchline with his shoulder. Ferguson thought that should have produced a booking. Atkinson kept his cards in his pocket but did award a foul. Yet when Sylvain Distin did exactly the same thing to Ronaldo in the area, as the winger drove goalwards after accepting a superb pass from Rooney, no offence was deemed to have been committed. Yet if one was a fair shoulder charge, so was the other. The only possible explanation was that Atkinson did not fancy awarding a penalty so early in the game. For all Ferguson's fury his side still had over 80 minutes in which to win, yet played into Pompey's hands by growing frustrated. Either Rooney or Carlos T\u00e9vez should have scored midway through the first half when they caught Portsmouth on the break, but T\u00e9vez delayed his pass too long to put Rooney clear, Rooney rounded James but found Sol Campbell had got back in time to dispossess him, and when the loose ball rolled to T\u00e9vez with only Glen Johnson defending the goal he inexplicably opted for a snap shot that the defender was able to head away. That was by no means the end of the slapstick either. In the space of five minutes T\u00e9vez inadvertently cleared a goal-bound Nemanja Vidic header off the Portsmouth line, then fell over when Evra's cut-back presented him with a chance in front of goal. Ferguson hoicked him off shortly afterwards, together with the equally disappointing Owen Hargreaves, only to see substitute Michael Carrick miss what looked an open goal when Distin arrived at the last second with a superb tackle on the line. There was more, much more, but the only thing that matters is that United were caught cold at a corner 12 minutes from time, when James's smart clearance sent Milan Baros and Nico Kranjcar running at just Anderson and Rooney. It was not much of a contest and when the latter squared to the former, Tomasz Kuszczak, on at half-time for groin-strain victim Edwin van der Sar, was obliged to bring down Baros. There was some debate about whether he should have been sent off, with Rooney standing on the line, but once Sulley Muntari had scored past Ferdinand from the spot there was not much point in complaining. Not until after the game, anyway. 'The referee today was unbelievable,' Ronaldo said. 'There were three bad fouls in the first few minutes, and if the referee doesn't want to give yellow cards or penalties he cannot protect the skilful players. I am becoming scared to go past people. It is difficult to play football in these circumstances. It is just a joke.' Man of the match: Sylvain Distin Lassana Diarra was magnificent in midfield, but the game really revolved around three moments, the two blocks on the line and the first-half penalty that wasn't. Distin was involved in two of them, with a superb interception to deny Carrick and a perfectly timed shoulder charge to stop Ronaldo. THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT Ray Hunt, Observer reader We feel a little hard done by, but you have to credit Pompey for their game plan, albeit a limited one. I haven't seen replays in terms of what contact Kuszczak made, but the sending-off was cruel given he wasn't the last man and Ronaldo was flattened by Distin for a blatant penalty in the first half. But it was a fantastic day for Pompey and their fans and I hope they now win the Cup. We couldn't take our chances and it wasn't to be - the crowd were nervous the way it was going at half time. Scholes was really off his game - Carrick and Anderson should have come on earlier - though Evra going forward and Vidic under the aerial assaults were excellent. The stand-out player, though, was Diarra for Pompey - it's hard to see why Arsenal let him go. Fan's player ratings Van der Sar 7 (Kuszczak 6); Brown 6, Ferdinand 7, Vidic 8, Evra 8; Ronaldo 6, Scholes 5, Hargreaves 6 (Carrick 6), Nani 6; Rooney 7, Tevez 6 (Anderson 6) Colin Farmery, Pompey-Fans.com Without doubt this was the greatest result I've known in 38 years of supporting Pompey. This was once-in-a-lifetime stuff and Project Wembley is on. There's been this feeling all through the Cup run that this could be our year and even when the draw was made I was only disappointed for an hour that it was United. They put their top boys out and don't forget they never lose when Rooney and Ronaldo start. Well, they did today! Sir Alex Ferguson, your boys took one hell of a beating. All our players were absolutely outstanding, restricting United to a couple of chances. This team are up for the Cup and have the mentality to win the competition. The fans never stopped shouting - I brought my wife and son all the way up here. What a day, what an extraordinary day.
