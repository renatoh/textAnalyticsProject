In the second day of hearings, jurisdictions including the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania defended WA\u2019s ability to set tighter policies to prevent the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d reintroduction of coronavirus. The high court reserved its decision on Wednesday afternoon, meaning a result could come in as little as two weeks in Palmer\u2019s bid to overturn border policies the federal court has already found are substantially effective at keeping out the virus. The case now turns on whether the border ban is \u201creasonably necessary\u201d, or if the existence of lighter touch policies proves WA has overreacted and breached the constitution\u2019s ban on blocking interstate movement. On Tuesday, Palmer\u2019s lawyers abandoned their claim the border ban is directed at preventing interstate movement instead of the spread of Covid-19, but opened up a new line of attack by arguing the ban may not be authorised by emergency laws. On Wednesday, WA\u2019s solicitor general, Joshua Thomson, continued the state\u2019s case by arguing the state of emergency was \u201ctemporary\u201d \u2013 because it has to be extended every two weeks \u2013 and proportionate to fight a virus with a \u201csignificant mortality rate\u201d. Thomson noted coronavirus is particularly harmful for subsections of the population, including Indigenous Australians and those in aged care, citing mortality rates as high as 22% for those aged 80 and above. Thomson argued Palmer had failed to prove a \u201cdiscriminatory purpose\u201d behind the border ban, which applies equally to interstate and international movements. Thomson rejected Palmer\u2019s view that travel from Queensland represented a low risk, saying it \u201cdoesn\u2019t take account of border hopping\u201d, in which travellers come from high-risk jurisdictions via low-risk ones. He concluded that WA\u2019s border ban was \u201cthe most effective\u201d policy and there were \u201cno other measures available\u201d that were less restrictive of movement. The ACT solicitor general, Peter Garrisson, told the court although some jurisdictions are currently low risk, new cases could elevate the risk. \u201cThere only needs one case and the consequences for Western Australia would be catastrophic,\u201d he said. Justice Stephen Gageler noted that the ACT and other jurisdictions had adopted \u201cless restrictive means to deal with exactly the same crisis\u201d. Garrisson countered that the ACT and WA had geographical differences that made a border ban more feasible and effective in WA. Tasmania\u2019s solicitor general, Michael O\u2019Farrell, added that although less restrictive measures were possible, Palmer\u2019s case had failed to show they would \u201cachieve the same purpose to the same degree\u201d. In its submissions, Victoria argued WA\u2019s laws are \u201cvalid and effective\u201d because they \u201ccan only be exercised\u201d for emergency management purposes, not the purpose of discriminating against interstate movement. South Australia submitted that Palmer\u2019s case conflates the effect of WA\u2019s border ban and its purpose, while Queensland argued that Palmer had failed to identify any alternative set of policies that would be as effective as WA\u2019s ban with a lesser burden on interstate movement. In reply, Palmer\u2019s counsel, Peter Dunning, said the case should not turn on whether WA is \u201cakin to South Australia or the Northern Territory\u201d with great physical distances or akin to the ACT, Queensland or New South Wales with closer knit border communities. \u201cIt is the fact that, despite their differences, all of them were able to come up with a regime that was far less onerous than Western Australia,\u201d he said. Premier Mark McGowan has announced WA will reopen to all states and territories from 14 November, with some restrictions remaining for residents of New South Wales and Victoria."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
