I love the pressure\u2019", "bodyText": "Greg Rutherford believes he is in the best shape of his career and the Olympic long jump champion is thriving under the pressure of being the bookmakers\u2019 favourite for the Rio Games. Rutherford, who is in action at the Rome Diamond League on Thursday before jumping in Birmingham on Sunday, has not a lost in 10 competitions since coming third in the London Anniversary Games in July last year and says he now expects to become Olympic champion again. \u201cArguably I\u2019m in the best shape I\u2019ve ever been,\u201d said Rutherford, who has already jumped further than 8.30m twice while winning all six events in which he has competed this season. \u201cResults will always reflect that and I\u2019ve never started with the distances I\u2019ve opened up with. It was also nice to get that early win over one of my main rivals, Jeff Henderson, in Long Beach.\u201d The 29-year-old faces even tougher competition in Rome from the three men who have the longest jumps in the world in 2016. Among his rivals are Marquise Goodwin, who has a world-leading 8.45m after taking a brief sabbatical from his National Football League career with the Buffalo Bills to attempt Olympic qualification, and the South African Rushwal Samaai, who has jumped 8.38m. The American Mike Hartfield, who has leapt 8.34m, is another significant threat but Rutherford still believes in himself. \u201cI like to think that going in as defending Olympic champion and current world champion, they look at me as one of their main rivals,\u201d he said. \u201cI completely respect the fact that all these guys can do really well on the day and jump very far. But I still see all of them as people I can beat. As long as I\u2019m going in to a championships fit and healthy there\u2019s no reason I can\u2019t win it. It\u2019s my best start to the season ever. And I\u2019m unbeaten for nearly a year, so it\u2019s not going too bad.\u201d Rutherford is also getting used to the fact he is a favourite for the Games \u2013 something that was not the case at the London Olympics four years ago. \u201cA few people still owe me a drink from 2012 because they put bets on me when it was long odds and they did quite well out of it,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cBut this is where I have always wanted to be. I won\u2019t shy away from saying I always put a lot of pressure on myself. I expect to win, and when I don\u2019t I understand what comes with that as well. And that\u2019s fine. \u201cI will go into the Olympic Games expecting to win the Olympic Games. It is just how I see it and it\u2019s no disrespect to everybody else because there are some very good jumpers there. It\u2019s great that I\u2019m the bookies\u2019 favourite, and I quite like that. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been bookies\u2019 favourite for anything before now.\u201d Rutherford, who holds the world, Commonwealth and European titles, attributes his form to spending the winter with his American coach, Dan Pfaff, in Arizona, where he set several personal bests lifting weights in the gym and also further honed his technique. \u201cThis year I\u2019ve heavily invested in going to America in order to see Dan and train with his group,\u201d Rutherford said. \u201cI\u2019ve never done anything that long before and it was hugely beneficial. It just felt that when we were living in Arizona I was cracking on with some really good work. I am very happy with the team around me. My coach is a bit of a genius. \u201cI had a little adductor problem and stupid chest infection that wrote off the indoor season but that quickly passed and I was training really well again. It was a fantastic three months in Arizona so I think I\u2019ve benefited hugely from it.\u201d Rutherford said he was also reaping the rewards of many years\u2019 experience and training at the top level. \u201cI am getting a bit old now, which does help on some levels because the experience of how your body reacts to training helps hugely.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
