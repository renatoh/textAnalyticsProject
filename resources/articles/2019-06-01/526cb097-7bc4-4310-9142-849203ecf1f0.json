The denouement in their match was farcical, with Argentina equalising through a retaken penalty and the referee then blowing the final whistle without adding on as much time as Scotland expected. What a bitter, perplexing way to go out. England, meanwhile, can have concerns about the scrappiness of some of their play but that\u2019s small beer compared to Scotland\u2019s woe. 90+3 min:Bonsegundo converts the retaken penalty to make it Scotland 3-3 Argentina! The Scots were three goals up and now they need to produce something even more freakish that what we\u2019ve already seen to snatch a winner. 90+2 min: No sentence is ever truly finished in the age of Var ... Scotland\u2019s lead may not be intact, after all, because the penalty has to be retaken! Apparently Alexander strayed off her line before making the save.... 90+1 min: Argentina\u2019s penalty ... is saved by Alexander, who gets up to block the rebound too! Scotland\u2019s lead is intact! 90 min+1 : A wonderful pass with the outside of the boot by Iwabuchi brings Bardlsey hurtling off her line again to make a critical interception. Meanwhile, Argentina are preparing to take a penalty in Paris ... 88 min: As Scotland fans hold their breath in Paris because the referee is checking Var to see whether Argentina should be awarded a penalty, Japan go close to scoring in Nice. Bardsley makes a fine save to deny Sugasawa after England were cut open again. 85 min: Iwabuchi, Japan\u2019s most inventive player, tries to beat Bardsley from 20 yards. Nothing doing. That settles it! The recently arrived Carney slips a tidy pass through to White, who finishes clinically from 16 yards! England substitution: Parris on, Duggan off after a quiet first appearance in the tournament. 83 min: Samashima clips a dainty ball in from the left. Bardlsey comes to intercept but Sugasawa beats her to it at the near post ... and pokes it just wide! \u201cWatching England I feel that Phil Neville has adopted his own England coach Sven Goran Eriksson\u2019s first half good second half not so good approach,\u201d parps Marty. \u201cThey are desperately hanging on here, aren\u2019t they?\u201d They are, but, in fairness, their first half had ropey spells, too. 81 min: England are haning on here, grateful that Japan don\u2019t have the potency around the box to match their nimble build-ups. Meanwhile in Paris, Argentina are threatening a comeback to sicken Scotland. Having been three goals down, they\u2019ve just cut the deficit to 3-2 ... 78 min: Sugasawa does well to take down a long pass from the right on her chest and then spanks the bouncing ball just over the bar from inside the D. 76 min: England are carved open! Iwabuchi took a pass on the turn in the pocket between England\u2019s midfield and defence. Then she threaded a perfect pass through to Sugasawa... who failed to take it under control when she only had the keeper to beat! That\u2019s a mighty let-off for England. 74 min: Argentina have pulled a goal back against Scotland, who now only lead 3-1. England substitution: Carney on, Stanway off after a bright performance. 73 min: More wonky play by England in midfield allows the ball to pop out to Sugasawa, who tries a snapshot from 20 yards. Her low fizzer is saved comfortably by Bardsley. England substitution: Moore on, Walsh off. A good decision by Neville, as Walsh\u2019s passing under pressure was ropey. 70 min: England have lost their way again. Meanwhile, Scotland are roared into a 3-0 lead against Argentina, with Cuthbert hitting the latest following goals by Beattie and Little. If things stay the same there, only a preposterous series of results tomorrow will deny Scotland a place in the next round. Such misfortune couldn\u2019t possibly befall Scotland footballers, could it? 68 min: Not for the first time, Walsh is caught in possession just in front of her own defender. But England rally sufficiently to force Japan backwards. Still, Japan are starting to become bothersome to them again. 66 min: A vital, impeccably timed tackle by Houghton thwarts Sugasawa as the substitute tried to wriggle into a shooting position in the English box. 64 min: Japan half-clear a long throw-in into their area. Stanway latches on to it about 25 yards out and tries to return the bouncing ball into the net. It flies wide of the near post. Japan substitutions: Miura and Sugasawa on, Yokoyama and Kobayashi off 59 min: That\u2019s better from England! Daly bounds down the right and then spots Bronze coming up on the underlap, so she loops a smart pass into the full-back\u2019s path. Bronze curls a cross towards the back post, slightly behind Duggan, who manages to adjust and wrap her foot around a volley. But it\u2019s not as sweet a connection as she would have liked and she fires it into the ground, allowing Yamashita to make another decent save to stop the ball bouncing into the net. 56 min: Shoddy play by England at the back, as Bright shonks a pass intended for Bronze straight out of play. Neville immediately tells his subs to go warm up: either because he\u2019s about to make a change or to a warning to the players on the pitch that he doesn\u2019t want this performance to slip back into the sloppiness that broke out mid-way through the first half. Their strong start to the second period is starting to crumble ... 54 min: Duggan nicks the ball off the foot of Nakajima just as the Japanese forward wound up a shot at the edge of the English box. 52 min: Stanway does well to nick the ball off Shimizu wide on the left as Japan tried to play their way out from the back. That\u2019s symptomatic of the improvement in England since the break: they have been much sharper and more forceful, pushing Japan back and refusing to let them find any kind of passing groove. 50 min: Scotland have gone 2-0 up against Argentina thanks to a goal by Beattie. That does a power of good to their hopes of reaching the knockout stages as one of the best third-placed countries. 49 min: Daly dances in from the right as England continue to dominate. Her cross provokes havoc in the box, and Japan are eventually greatful to get the ball out for a corner. 47 min: England have started the second period as if instructed to be more assertive. Their passing is crisper and their running purposeful and powerful. Japan are starting to creak ... 46 min: All set for Act II. No changes by either side during the break. England are on course for top spot in the group thanks to White\u2019s well-taken goal, which was well created by Stanway. They\u2019ve had chances to increase their leads but been denied by fine goalkeeping; but they were were worried as the half progressed by the way Japan started to outplay them with snappy passing, albeit without creating clear chances. There\u2019s plenty of work to be done yet... 43 min: Scott\u2019s holds off her market as she receives a throw-in on the right and then hooks a cross into the middle. But the goalkeeper steps out to claim it. 41 min: Another intricate move by Japan peters out as they near the English box, with Yokoyama poking a feeble effort way wide from 20 yards. 39 min: Japan have gained the upperhand in the last 10 minutes or so thanks to their zippy passing but they\u2019ve yet to create a really clear chance to equalise. 37 min: After more deft probing by Japan, Sameshima tries to switch play with a long pass over the top of Stokes for Kobayashi. But it\u2019s fractionally overhit. 35 min: England relieve the pressure with a fine long pass over the top from the back. Daly outmuscles Sameshima to get to it and tries to fire into the net from the edge of the box, but Yamashita makes another decent save! 33 min: Daly makes good ground down the right before playing in Scott, whose cross on the run is miscued. 32 min: Nakajima rolls a short, disguised freekick to Yokoyama, who tries to curl the ball into the net from over 25 yards. Her execution does not match her ambition. 30 min: Japan are starting to win the majority of duels in midfield. Stanway is the latest to be caught out. England need to sharpen up in the middle. 28 min: England are caught in possession in midfield. Sugita looks quickly for Iwabuchi, making a run into the box. But Bardsley steps off her line to claim the incoming pass. 25 min: Neat play by Japan down the right before Stokes intervenes, putting a cross by Kobayashi out for a corner. Bit it comes to nought, as Japan are penalised for a foul in the box as the ball comes in. 23 min: England sweep forward after ending a bitty Japanese attack. Daly charges down the right before sending in a nice cross towards White, who tries to flick it goalwards. It drops several yards wide of the far post. 20 min: Scotland have boosted their chances of taking third place in this group by taking the lead against Argentina thanks to a goal by Little. 19 min: Stanway fires off a vicious shot from 20 yards, forcing a superb one-handed save from the goalkeeper, at the expense of another corner for England. That really was a good stop by Yamashita because she had to adjust as the ball swirled in the air. And Stanway is having a stormer so far, too. 17 min: England are playing with swagger now. Scott tries to top off a period of expansive play with a cracking drive from 25 yards, which is put out for a corner. Stanway makes a lovely turn mid-way inside the Japanese half and then, while sliding, slips a canny pass through to White, who latches on to it on the left-hand side side of the box and coolly slots it past the advancing goalkeeper. A splendid way to open the scoring! 13 min: Duggan\u2019s dangerous delivery causes problems for Japan but they eventually scramble it out for another corner. This one is overhit. 12 min: Stanway wins the ball in opposing territory as Japan are caught trying to play their way out. She exchanges passes with Daly and then unloads a shot from 25 yards. It takes a nick on its way wide, giving England a corner. 10 min: Japan are happy to let England knock it around the back, but once the Lionesses try to advance up the pitch they find the going much tougher. 8 min: Freekick to Japan mid-way inside the English half. Yokoyama lines it up as if she\u2019s going to shoot ... and she unleashes a swirling beauty! Bardsley hurls herself across her goal and gets both hands to it, pushing it out for a corner. Terrific shot and save! 8 min: White collects a long throw-in at the edge of the Japanese six-yard box and tries to bustle her way into a shooting position, but three defenders prevents her from turning. 6 min: Loose play by Walsh in the English half cedes possession to Japan, who go in quick for the attempted kill. But Yokoyama skies her shot from the edge of the area. 4 min: Stokes does well to win back possession for England in the opposing half after Iwabuchi threatened to launch a counter-attack. 2 min: England stroke the ball around the back for about a minute. Japan aren\u2019t too bothered about pressing. This is not a start that could be described as urgent. 1 min: We have kickoff! Japan get the game going and immediately begin zipping the ball around with their customary precision ... for about 15 seconds, whereupon England get a throw-in. The anthems having been solemnly sung, it\u2019s nearly time for the action... AC/DC\u2019s Shook Me ALl Night Long has been replaced by an excitable PA announcer, who tells the crowd that the teams are about to enter the pitch. And here they come, full of smiles and relaxed vibes! The crowd has swelled too, so the stadium in Nice looks to be around half-full. In today\u2019s other game in this group, Scotland are taking on Argentina with a potential route to the knockout stages up for grabs by dint of finishing as one of the best third place teams. Here is the lineup that Shelley Kerr has gone for: Scotland: Alexander, Smith, Corsie, Beattie, Docherty, Evans, Little, Crichton, Weir, Emslie, Cuthbert. It looks like this duel for top spot/second spot has not exactly gripped the locals: the stadium looks to be about a quarter full. Mind you, the stadium in Nice is hard to get to - the transport links are frankly rubbish - so maybe there have been delays and and there\u2019ll be an influx in the 30 minutes before kickoff. Toni Duggan is on the pitch warming up with the rest of her teammates. In a pre-recorded interview with BBC she says she\u2019s been impressed by the team\u2019s performances so far. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to come so far but so far it\u2019s been job done. Two games, two wins, and good performances as well against good teams ... The girls have handled it so well.\u201d Regarding Japan she says \u201cthey\u2019re a great team ... they\u2019re really good on the ball, technically very gifted. It\u2019s going to be very tough but I love playing against Japan.\u201d After all his brave talk about fielding his best tea in the wholesome pursuit of a victory, Phil Neville has jazzed up his lineup with no fewer than eight changes. Notabe among the newcomers is Toni Duggan, who\u2019ll make her first appearance of the tournament after recovering from injury. Japan have made just two changes. Japan: Yamashita; Shimizu, Kumagai, Ichise, Sameshima; Kobayashi, Nakajima, Sugita, Endo; Yokoyama, Shimizu England: Bardsley; Bronze, Houghton, Bright, Stokes; Walsh, Scott; Daly, Duggan, Stanway; White Referee: C Umpierrez (Uruguay) Hello and welcome to the decisive match in Group D. We are assured there will be no jiggery pokery here, as the managers of England and Japan say their teams are hellbent on victory even though failure to win might mean an easier path to the final. Yes, winning this group could prove somewhat Pyrrhic, as it could result in facing France or the United States in the semi-finals, whereas finishing runners-up might put off such a showdown until the final. But such calculations are not worth dwelling on for Phil Neville, who says his team are all about trying to beating whomever they come up against - in other words, though a draw might do for them here, playing for a draw just will not do. Besides, what a boost it would be to England to avenge that painful semi-final defeat of four years ago, when Japan prevailed 2-1. So then: Bring. It. On! Kick-off: 8pm BST, 4am Japan, 9pm local."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
