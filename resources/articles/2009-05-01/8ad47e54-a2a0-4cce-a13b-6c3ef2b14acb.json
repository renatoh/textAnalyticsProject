Unlike the simple acid or alkali strips familiar from school, his pioneering work owes more to microfluidics than pH sensitive dyes. The development of cheap and simple paper diagnostics may now help revolutionise third-world medical testing. While everyone takes it for granted, paper is more than a surface for writing on. Its porosity can ensure that drops of liquid quickly spread out by capillary action or wicking. As the capillary effect provides a useful free pump, a sample drop may be moved across the paper into test wells, reacting there to produce visible colour changes. \"The basic idea of making channels and directing fluids - that was clearly a good idea,\" says Whitesides. By harnessing a photoresist technique, he created polymer-lined channels to direct and manipulate minute quantities of fluids. Chromotography paper is soaked with a light-sensitive polymer photoresist that hardens when exposed to UV light. This leaves walls inside the paper once the unexposed polymer is dissolved. \"This photoresist technique is still the highest resolution we have for making channels in paper,\" he says. The stamp-sized paper devices are capable of being printed in high volumes. A single drop of blood can be channelled to different test wells containing reagents and results appear as simple colour changes, making it ideal for third world use. \"I think it's going to be possible to do sophisticated biological chemistry and cell biology using these methods,\" says Whitesides, who has co-founded the non-profit Diagnostics for All, which plans to deploy paper-based liver-function tests in Africa. Dr Caje Moniz, the clinical director of clinical biochemistry at King's College Hospital, London, is responsible for a diagnostic blood sciences lab. From a 5ml sample, autoanalysers perform up to 40 tests. King's also runs Europe's largest liver transplant programme with patients travelling just to give blood to assess liver status. Dr Moniz says there are strip tests for cholesterol, urine, and pregnancy but not key liver enzymes. \"Liver function might be a good one... the surgeons have been asking me: is there nothing we can do to get the result by post?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
