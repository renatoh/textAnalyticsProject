Rugby is all about momentum and the first team would have had six days to turn round, which is possible. Either way, it's now about getting the team right on the field; in the famous first match of the 2000 Six Nations, when we, as champions, lost 34-20 in Rome, we had John Leslie as captain after he had been injured and had flown in from Japan. That was a mistake. 2 Match them in the forwards Another thing we didn't do in 2000, although we were doing our bit for international rugby by letting them win, of course. In the current squad, if not in today's team, the lock Scott Murray is the only survivor of that match. He has played in all four losses to Italy since 1998, so he'll be good for the younger guys to speak to. The size of our current pack is encouraging, but the Italians are strong too and while I expect the line-outs to be about equal they will fancy their chances in the scrummage, with Martin Castrogiovanni, Salvatore Perugini and Andrea Lo Cicero in there and Scotland having lost Alan Jacobsen at loose-head. Then again, the scrummage has not been a key area so far: England shoved South Africa about and lost 36-0 and New Zealand shoved us all over the field and we won three or four penalties from it. Of course, it's not just about the pack - Ireland showed how to run Italy ragged in the last Six Nations match this year - but either way you need a dynamic No8, and Simon Taylor and Sergio Parisse fit that billing. They might as well be playing a mini trial for a place in the Stade Fran\u00e7ais team after the World Cup. 3 Kick your goals With Chris Paterson, it's a different question: should he play at fly-half? Dan Parks will instead, but Chris's kicking should be OK wherever he plays. When I was playing, we never had a consistent kicker. It was Kenny Logan, or me, or Duncan Hodge. The pressure was intense and when you missed it felt like letting down a nation. Chris also missed a lot when he started, but he worked damned hard and he's right up there with the best. 4 Keep the crowd quiet In 2000, we underestimated how big a game it was for Italy; they'd been waiting so long to get into the Six Nations, they were at home, they were playing the champions. They were very passionate, very physical; in the first 20 or 30 minutes the noise was incredible. Their stadium only holds 30,000 or so but it produces a much more intimidating atmosphere than Murrayfield; St-Etienne might be similar. If the chants of \"Italia, Italia\" get going things can get quite hairy and they are relentless when they are on the front foot. In 2000, when the pitch invasion began, I just wanted to get off, but the changing rooms were down a stairway you couldn't take quickly in your studs. It was horrible. I also remember Rome in 2002, when we won. There was a thing in Italian football at the time where players would throw their shirts into the crowd, so at the end the locals wanted our kit. Some of our guys didn't understand and I remember Glenn Metcalfe having to fight his way off the field. Never mind the fight on it. 5 Keep your head Italy are a good side - they won two games in the Six Nations and pushed Ireland in the warm-ups and most of them have beaten Scotland before. This, therefore, is not a \"banana skin\"; it's what the French call a seizi\u00e8me-final, the round before the last eight, rather like the match we won against Fiji, 22-20, in Sydney in 2003. Then, when Rupeni Caucaunibuca was running riot, we could have lost our heads. (He was getting tired and he was falling over at the time, but I maintain it was like bringing down Jonah Lomu at his best.) We got through it, and we could have made a better fist of the quarter-final against Australia. This time, it's probably Argentina in Paris for the winners and you'd take that instead of France. After that it would be South Africa for a place in the final and that would not be an impossible task. Imagine the boost for the country that would be. Still, it's time to concentrate on the task in hand . . .
