In the urban centre of Temuco, hooded demonstrators lassoed a statue of a 16th-century Spanish conquistador last week and yanked it to the ground. Cheering bystanders \u2013 many wearing the traditional ponchos and headbands of the indigenous Mapuche people \u2013 stamped on the bronze effigy of Pedro de Valdivia and hammered it with wooden staffs. In the city of Concepci\u00f3n \u2013 which Valdivia found in 1550 \u2013 a crowd toppled another bust of the Spanish coloniser, impaled it on a spike, and barbecued it at the feet of a statue of his historical nemesis, the Mapuche chieftain Lautaro. In the nearby town of Collipulli, a bronze of General Cornelio Saavedra \u2013 notorious for leading the bloody 19th-century \u201cpacification\u201d of the Mapuche heartland \u2013 suffered a similar fate. Most dramatically of all, a statue in Temuco of the Chilean military aviator Dagoberto Godoy (1893-1960) was decapitated, and his head hung from the arm of a statue of the Mapuche warrior Caupolic\u00e1n \u2013 now also holding the Mapuche flag, or Wenufoye. The statues have been targeted amid the worst outbreak of political unrest in Chile since the end of Augusto Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship, after what began as a protest over subway fares transformed into a nationwide uprising demanding dramatic changes to the country\u2019s economic and political system. The attacks on symbols of Spanish colonial rule have provoked a war of words recalling debates in the US over monuments to Confederate generals, or in the UK regarding prominent statues of slavers and imperialists. Conservative Chilean commentators have branded them acts of vandalism and the work of \u201cprofessional agitators\u201d. Others describe an organic \u2013 if overexuberant \u2013 desire to challenge established historical narratives. \u201cThese are actions of a very potent symbolism, in rejecting an official version that has falsified and grossly airbrushed our history,\u201d said Pedro Cayuqueo, a Mapuche writer and historian. \u201cThere\u2019s something far deeper going on.\u201d The toppling of statues also reflects deep modern-day grievances felt by the Mapuche, who were absorbed into the Chilean state at gunpoint 150 years ago. Chile\u2019s largest native people \u2013 comprising 10% of the national population of 17 million \u2013 has chafed under a far-off central government ever since. Unequal land ownership, deforestation, pollution and limited political representation were entrenched by the brutal 1973-90 Pinochet regime. \u201cWe Mapuche have been questioning the economic model and social contract inherited from the dictatorship since the day after the return to democracy,\u201d Cayuqueo added. This discontent regularly spills over into violence. Radical Mapuche groups have firebombed more than 900 targets, often ranches and timber trucks, since 2011, claiming 20 lives. Chile\u2019s militarised police force, have killed about 15 Mapuche since 1990. The fatal police shooting of an unarmed Mapuche farmer named Camilo Catrillanca, a year ago \u2013 and the attempted cover-up that followed \u2013 provoked widespread, lingering fury. Demonstrators in the capital have carried Catrillanca\u2019s image and waved the Wenufoye, but it is unclear how much the average protester relates to indigenous issues. \u201cThe Mapuche flag cannot only be seen as symbol in favour of the Mapuche cause,\u201d said Kenneth Bunker, a Chilean political scientist, \u201cbut also as an anti-system emblem.\u201d Working-class Chileans share Mapuche scorn for a distant economic and political elite, but are mainly angered by low wages and pensions, poor public healthcare and high school fees, Bunker added. Still, Mapuche activist groups \u2013 who marched together in Temuco last week \u2013 are hoping that near-unanimous support for rewriting Chile\u2019s Pinochet-era constitution will provide a window of opportunity. Chief among their objectives is for Chile to become a \u201cplurinational state\u201d like neighbouring Bolivia, granting native peoples greater political autonomy, and their languages and customs official status. Such demands are shared by smaller aboriginal groups like the Diaguita, an Andean desert people with some 90,000 self-identified descendants. Protesters in the northern city of La Serena likewise felled and burned a statue of the conquistador Francisco de Aguirre in late October, replacing it with an image of \u201cMilanka\u201d, a Diaguita woman. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2019. An earlier version incorrectly said that the decapitated head of a statue of the Chilean founding father Diego Portales was hung from the statue of Caupolic\u00e1n. The head was from a statue of the military aviator Dagoberto Godoy. This has been corrected in the text and picture caption."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
