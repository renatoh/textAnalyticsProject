Thus 'neoconservative' is used by the American right to describe a radical policy doctrine, while the European left uses it as a handy alternative to 'Yankee imperialist pig-dog'. Francis Fukuyama is not neoconservative, at least not since the Iraq war. In After the Neocons, Fukuyama, a political economist and pillar of the conservative American intellectual establishment, disavows the Bush administration and all its works. For practising neocons this is a big disappointment. Imagine Karl Marx returning from the grave in 1922 to suggest that Lenin had rather missed the point of what he had been trying to say. That is exaggerating things a bit. But in 1992 Fukuyama wrote The End of History and the Last Man, whose main thesis was co-opted and contorted to support right-wing adventures. He argued that the close of the Cold War ended the evolution of ideology. Liberal democracy was it. He doubted whether a serious alternative ideology would challenge democracy as communism did. He did not foresee the turn that history would take on 11 September 2001. Few did. Fukuyama now distances himself from Bush's disastrous conclusion - based partly on his End of History theory - that the world would be safer if the advent of democracy in unstable places could be hurried along by overwhelming military force. This, he says, is strong-arming evolution. The unintended consequences mean it never works. He details why Bush was so wrong: the lack of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction; the non-connection between Baghdad and 9/11; the underestimate of hostility to US motives in the Middle East and Europe; the rubbish diplomacy. Much more interesting is Fukuyama's attempt to rescue The End of History by explaining how radical Islam does not constitute an ideological challenge to democracy of the type that he had earlier said would never emerge. It is tricky. Extreme Islamism looks superficially as if it has a better chance than either communism or fascism ever did. But, says Fukuyama, the real security threat to the West comes not from Islamic countries but from Muslims inside western societies: second- and third-generation immigrants who have failed to assimilate and suffer essentially the same alienation that drives aggrieved white people to become neo-Nazi skinheads. There is no terrorism inherent in Islam, and no clash of civilisations, but there is a crisis in world diplomacy. Fukuyama's prescription is to use American power not to reshape the globe in its image but to build more effective and more legitimate international institutions. He doesn't say that the Bush White House can never achieve such a thing since its diplomatic credibility and moral authority have been squandered. He doesn't have to. Everyone but the dwindling band of neocons knows it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
