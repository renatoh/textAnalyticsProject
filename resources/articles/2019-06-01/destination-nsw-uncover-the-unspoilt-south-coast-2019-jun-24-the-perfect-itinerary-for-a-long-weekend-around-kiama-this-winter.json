Rolling green paddocks of dairy farmland drop into the ocean; it\u2019s head-turning stuff. There\u2019s a lot going on in this bucolic area, with great coastal and rainforest walks, blowholes, farmers\u2019 markets, country pubs and beachside cafes to warm you up after a swim or surf. Here is our itinerary for the ultimate three days in the Kiama area. Day 1 Parfait Patisserie 8am If you set off early from Sydney or Canberra you\u2019ll make it into Kiama by mid-morning. When you hit town, grab a coffee at the Brooding Italian, which roasts its own beans - a tip from local dairy farmer, Kel Grey, from the Pines. 10am Call in at Parfait Patisserie to pick up pastry on the way through town. 11am Drive up into the Minnamurra Rainforest for a walk. Grey says this is a good spot for kids. \u201cThere\u2019s a short 1km loop, which is all boardwalk that you can do with a pram or with toddlers,\u201d he says. Keep going up to Barren Grounds and take an easy 2km walk to the lookout for views over Kiama and the escarpment. Or push on for another 8km along the Griffiths walking track. 12pm On the way back, stop at the Jamberoo Pub. \u201cIt\u2019s the best pub in the region,\u201d Grey says. There\u2019s live music on Sundays, and the pub is an icon for motorbike riders, who love the winding road leading up to Jamberoo. Grab a counter meal here, or head back to Kiama for lunch at the Hungry Monkey. Grey recommends the burgers and great coffee. 2pm Check in to your accommodation at Kelly Cottage, on a working farm overlooking the stunning Jamberoo Valley. 4pm Visit the Little Blowhole, a natural sea cave formed from volcanic lava. \u201cIt\u2019s smaller than the iconic Kiama blowhole, but just as impressive,\u201d Grey says. Look out for migrating whales between May and November. 5pm Pop your head into the Little Blowhole Art Bar, open from midday Friday to Sunday, showcasing contemporary local art. Or grab a hot chocolate at Little Earth Cafe. 6pm In the early evening, enjoy the views and have a drink at the Hill Bar + Kitchen in Gerringong and settle in for dinner at the Blue Swimmer, an iconic seafood restaurant on the Gerroa foreshore. Day 2 Werri Beach, Kiama 8am For a refreshing start, head down for a swim at Werri Beach in Gerringong, or a dip in the South Werri Rock Pool. 9am Thaw out with a coffee in the sun at the Gerringong Surf Club cafe, across the road from the beach. Then head up the hill to the main street of Gerringong (Fern Street) for breakfast at the Clay Coffee Collective, tucked into an arcade. Coffee is served in homemade ceramics and there\u2019s a small menu of toasties, open sandwiches and baked goods. 11am Walk around the main strip of shops in Gerringong - there are lots of homewares stores in which to browse, including Oak Home Living, Corner D\u2019or Homewares and 34 Degrees South Trading Company. 12.30 Drive back to Kiama for lunch at Penny Whistlers. \u201cIt\u2019s a top spot with views across the harbour to the lighthouse,\u201d Grey says. 2pm If you\u2019re in town midweek, visit the Kiama Farmers\u2019 Market on Wednesday afternoons from 2-5pm in Winter. Grey sells cheese, milk and gelato from the Pines, alongside producers including Pecora Dairy, Buena Vista Farm (which runs farm workshops teaching cheesemaking and fermenting), Schottlanders Wagyu beef, Kareelah Berry Farm and Moonacres organic farm. Other markets include the Gerringong Village Market on the third Saturday of every month, and the Kiama Seaside Markets at Black Beach on the third Sunday of the month. In the afternoon have a surf lesson with one of several local surf schools. Choose from Land\u2019s Edge, Surf Camp Australia, or Gerringong Surf School, run by former big wave pro surfer Rusty Moran at Seven Mile Beach. \u201cWe teach kids from the age of three to adults in their 50s,\u201d Moran says. \u201cMental health and mindfulness is a real focus at our school \u2026 we approach surfing with a holistic view to calm the nervous system and energise ourselves mentally, spiritually and physically.\u201d 4pm Drop in to the cellar door at Crooked River Wines, a family-owned vineyard on an incredible property. As well as wine tasting, the winery also offers a restaurant, a brewery (Uncle Joe\u2019s Brew) and an impressive line up of events. 7pm Feast on modern Italian with dinner at Silica. Chef Luke Basic is making waves with his use of local produce. Day 3 Stoic Brewing 7am Get up early for a stretch at Emergence Yoga. It also offers meditation, pilates and tai chi classes. 8.30am Refuel post-yoga with a nourishing breakfast bowl, Kiama bliss smoothie or brekkie burrito at the wholefoods eatery, Wild Patch. You\u2019ll also find kombucha on tap; ask the staff for the flavour of the day. 10am Complete a section of the stunning Kiama Coast Walk, which can be done in small or large sections. In full, it\u2019s 22km, but taken in short bits it can be less than a kilometre. Grey recommends doing the 6km from Kiama to Gerringong, for which you should allow three hours. You can do it on mountain bikes too. Alternatively, head to the Minnamurra Headland (on the walk but also accessible by car), where there is a whale watching platform. 2pm For lunch try Stoic Brewing in Gerringong. Try a brew on tap, or order a tasting paddle to try them all. The brewery often has food trucks and music on a Sunday afternoon.
