It had become usual for the squad to meet extra early at the training ground before travelling to St James\u2019 Park in their team bus, accompanied by a police escort. On Sunday it will be different with Alan Pardew\u2019s players driving themselves to the stadium as normal for Premier League home fixtures. The change was decided after Newcastle\u2019s manager became convinced by the new spirit of rapprochement between the two sets of fans in the wake of the deaths of Newcastle supporters John Alder and Liam Sweeney on flight MH17 in July. Suddenly the fear of off-field violence again scarring what Pardew terms \u201ca unique game\u201d has diminished. \u201cWe won\u2019t take a bus,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s manager. \u201cEverything will be normal. We are trying to get away from all that unsavoury stuff in the past. I would like to think everyone can treat this as exactly what it is \u2013 a football match.\u201d In the 17th minute of every home game there is a spontaneous 60 seconds of applause at St James\u2019 and Pardew hopes Sunderland\u2019s followers will join in this tribute to Alder and Sweeney on Sunday. \u201cIt would be nice if everyone applauded in the 17th minute,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Sunderland fans join in, our fans will appreciate it more than anything else in the derby. You have to give Sunderland fans credit for what happened over John and Liam.\u201d While Sunderland officials are supportive of the new \u201csoftly, softly\u201d approach to crowd control Gus Poyet\u2019s team will still be protected by an escort from Northumbria police which will flank them from the moment their coach leaves the club\u2019s Academy of Light training base on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
