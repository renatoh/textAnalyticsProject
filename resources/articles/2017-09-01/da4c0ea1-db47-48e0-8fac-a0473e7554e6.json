Abbott will give his speech, entitled Daring to Doubt, to the London-based Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) on 9 October. The GWPF is led by former UK chancellor Nigel Lawson, who recently incorrectly told the BBC the global temperature had \u201cslightly declined\u201d in the past decade. The BBC was heavily criticised for allowing Lawson to make factually inaccurate assertions unchallenged. Abbott becomes the second former Australian prime minister to be hosted by the GWPF. In 2013, John Howard \u2013 Abbott\u2019s old boss and political mentor \u2013 delivered the annual address. In his speech, called One Religion is Enough, Howard also incorrectly claimed global warming had stalled and expressed deep scepticism about the possibility of an international agreement on climate change. Two years later, the Paris climate treaty was struck. Under Abbott\u2019s leadership, Australia became something of a pariah on the issue of climate change. His government was known for its pro-coal and anti-climate action policies. Abbott infamously referred to climate science as \u201cbullshit\u201d and said coal was \u201cgood for humanity\u201d. The speech Abbott gives in London in October will be notable for its domestic political overtones. Climate change is a hugely volatile political issue in Australia and Abbott has successfully used the issue in the past to neuter political rivals, including the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, who deposed Abbott in 2015."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
