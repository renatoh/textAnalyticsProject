Born, like public schools, of the British attachment to cold showers and expensive discomfort, it depends on our willingness to work for almost nothing and our love of mucking in. No other nation goes in for it but, according to the Ski Club of Great Britain, it is the British skier's favourite holiday formula and accounts for 400,000 holidays a season. There are nowhere near enough real chalets to accommodate this many skiers, so the 'chalet holiday' concept has grown to embrace apartments and hotels run by British tour operators as giant house parties. The principle is the same: nobody inside has to eat foreign food, meet foreign people or pay through-the-nose hotel prices for alcohol. Chalet holidays ceased to be an upper-class thing long ago. The broadening of the clientele has brought about an improvement in standards, with better plumbing, better food and a proliferation of en suite bathrooms, indoor swimming pools, blow-dry boot heaters and other blandishments. Whether we choose luxury or a budget chalet with bunk beds in a curtained alcove makes no difference. The important thing is that chalet guests understand their role as facilitators of that cornerstone of the British further educational system, the Alpine season (Ski Le Gap), in which thousands of young people migrate to the Alps for five months to acquire the life skills of skiing and snowboarding. They may also improve their time management, learning to wash up, prepare supper for 10 and clean the house in under two hours with a hangover. Entrepreneurship is fostered too, as 'seasonaires' find ways to supplement a meagre income and fund a party lifestyle in resorts where beer costs \u00a35 a pint. These include snow clearing, massage, childcare, bootleg ski guiding/instruction, bread/newspaper delivery, airport taxi services. The fact that most of these activities are illegal - unofficial ski guides are specially vulnerable to arrest and imprisonment without trial - puts no one off. French prisons are no hardship after staff accommodation in Val d'Is\u00e8re. Seasonaires - chalet hosts, cooks, drivers, handymen, resort reps, regional reps, ski guides, bottle washers and cleaners - form self-contained Alpine communities in their favourite resorts: Val d'Is\u00e8re, Verbier, M\u00e9ribel and a handful of others, mostly in France. The local residents are incidental and holidaymakers - punters or billies (rhyming slang, from Billy Bunter) - are a necessary evil. The welcome drink - kir if your week's holiday has cost less than \u00a3750, kir royale (\u00a3750- \u00a31,000), champagne (\u00a31,000-plus) - gives chalet staff the chance to lay down the rules before you settle in. Ignore them at your peril. Here's our guide to the 10 commandments of chalet holidays. 1. Thou shalt read the brochure carefully Chalet and wine are words of almost infinite elasticity, but cosy means only one thing: small. Chalet architects make use of all roof space and broom cupboards to accommodate as many guests as possible. Chalet Les Gnellets in Val d'Is\u00e8re has 'two bedrooms under the eaves reached by a staircase with two low beams to test sobriety and two beds on the kitchen/sitting/living room mezzanine'. If it is true that the standard of chalet accommodation has improved at the more expensive end of the price range, budget operators still offer some old fashioned dumps. 'Chalet' Bellevue in Courchevel 1550 (a 'long standing favourite with Crystal guests') is actually three apartments. Apartment A has a double bed, a small cabin bunk room, two beds in the lounge area, and a shower/WC. Apartment B has a twin walk-through bedroom and double with shower/ WC. Apartment C (accessed by external staircase) has a double, a twin, bathroom and the chalet dining room and lounge. Room 20 in Esprit's Chalet Romeo at La Rosiere is a quad with twin beds, twin bunks, a bathroom and ... no window. The room is separated from the dining room by double glazing and curtains. 2. Thou shalt suck up to the chalet staff Yes, it's very kind of you to arrive bearing gifts for for the chalet host, but try to make it something original. Traditional unobtainables - Marmite, golden syrup, Frosties - are now available in Alpine supermarkets. Try Red Bull (illegal in France) and magazines such as OK and Heat . 3. Thou shalt make thyself scarce The perfect guest does not turn up at all, but cancels his entire group's holiday at the last minute, leaving the staff with the empty week they so richly deserve. If you must take your holiday, keep your presence in the chalet to a minimum. In these decadent days of luxury in many chalets - Jacuzzis, PlayStations and the like - ski truancy is an increasing problem for chalet staff. 'Get up in the morning when you are supposed to, eat breakfast quickly, then leave the chalet and don't come back before 5pm,' says Melissa (Val d'Is\u00e8re). 'There's nothing worse than people who mooch around the chalet all day, wanting cups of coffee, playing their hateful CDs and getting in the way.' Lucinda (M\u00e9ribel) says: 'If you are one of those irritating people who goes on a skiing holiday but doesn't ski then please at least vacate your bedroom after break fast so the chalet girl can clean it, or tell her very definitely that she needn't bother.' When you go out, don't leave your room in a mess. 'Dirty underwear and towels on a wet bathroom floor do not reflect well on you!' says Melissa. What do you think this is - a hotel? Make your own beds. 4. Thou shalt not be late for dinner At the welcome drink, the chalet hosts will let you know when they serve dinner - 7.30 if they can get away with it, 8 o'clock by special dispensation. 'Be on time for meals and don't sit round the table chatting when you've finished eating. Move to the sitting area so the chalet girl can clear the table and go out!' says Lucinda. Fiona (Courchevel) says: 'A much appreciated line, once pudding has been served is, \"You go. We can help ourselves to coffee.\" The chalet girl will head for the pub and come in early in the morning to clear up the night before.' This may not suit those sleeping on the mezzanine. Tough. The chalet kitchen is a no-go area, unless you're helping to wash up. 5. Thou shalt not covet the chalet staff Gentlemen, act your age. Reports of Fathers Who Flirt - 'sex-starved husbands who think that full service chalets mean close encounters with chalet staff' - are numerous. Of course the system is to blame, along with the altitude and free wine. Most men over 40 are unused to 20-year-old girls wanting to know how our day went and saying: 'Gosh, how fascinating. I've always wondered exactly what it is that an actuary does.' The attention can easily turn a chap's head. 6. Thou shalt respect the night off The chalet host's night off is a tradition as old as the mountains themselves. It is midweek - usually Thursday - and it is in fact a day off. Breakfast is left on the table to go stale overnight, there is no tea, no room cleaning, and supper is 'own arrangements', which do not include self-catering. Chalet staff do not wish to spend their free-time socialising with you - unless of course you are offering to buy dinner. They get free drinks in every bar in town, but restaurant food is a different matter. Lucinda explains: 'Chalet girls have their own friends in the resort and they would rather ski and go out with them than socialise with guests, unless they are the right age, good fun, or offering dinner.' 7. Thou shalt remove thy shoes at the door Chalet life is spent in socks. Despite this, chalet floors are often wet and have shards of Hoover-resistant broken glass stuck to the floor with cassis (from the welcome drink). By Tuesday, ski socks are rank. There is a strong case for slippers. 8. Thou shalt be tolerant of fellow guests The holiday formula works best when a group of friends takes over an entire chalet. In practice, more than two thirds of chalet weeks are sold piecemeal. Val d'Is\u00e8re specialist YSE accepts bookings from single people (over 18) to share rooms and 'in the infrequent event of incompatibility' - snoring, or worse - 'the disrupter is asked to adapt or find alternative lodgings'. In the old days operators would take details of their guests' ages, occupations and interests and, like good house party organisers, do their best to match socially compatible groups. Operators no longer disclose information about sharers (data protection) unless they want to sell the other half of your chalet to a family with three children under five, in which case they will ring you up and speak very nicely. You are in a strong negotiating position. Don't assume that you are safe from children if you book part of a chalet during term time. High season holidays are so exorbitant that skiers take their children out of school throughout the season. There is a general rule that children under 13 are not accepted in chalets outside school holidays unless the whole chalet is booked; and that in shared chalets children and adults eat separately. But beware the designation 'Family Chalet', which signifies children throughout the season, nappy sacks and sterilisers at every turn. Lucinda warns: 'Don't expect the chalet girl to stay in all day or night to look after your children. It isn't her job.' If you're willing to pay, however, make her an offer. 9. Thou shalt not abuse the free wine quota 'Free' wine and the chance to drink duty-free can easily save the thirsty chalet guest \u00a3150, compared with a typical hotel bar bill. The wine rules have been set in stone since the beginning of the chalet holiday: you can drink as much wine as you like at dinner, but wine is not available as an aperitif and once the pudding plates are removed and the jug of thin brown liquid that passes for coffee is set down on the table, the screwtop goes back on the bottle. Chalet wine is so cheap that the rules are not there to save money but to keep a lid on unruly behaviour. Chalet girls know how much free wine matters to guests and use it as a lever to encourage compliance. The rules can result in some undignified competitive drinking, as guests toy with their pavlova for hours, demanding refills. 'My worst guests were a group of eight who drank 30 bottles a night,' says Tom, a chef with Scott Dunn in Courchevel. 'They drank fast during dinner, within the rules, so there wasn't much we could do about it.' 10. Thou shalt show thine appreciation The American joke about the difference between a canoe and an Englishman - a canoe tips - is quite unfounded ... isn't it? Leftover duty free is welcome, but no substitute for a real tip. 'Cold, hard cash is the way forward,' says Lucinda. 'The wages are pitiful.' 'Children always mean more mess and noise,' says Melissa. 'Families should tip double.' Confessions of a chalet host Joanne Rolliston worked three winter seasons as a chalet girl for Inghams and now heads the ski company's chalet division. I didn't have too many bad experiences luckily, but I had a bunch of young farmers one week who were pretty wild. I never had to cook breakfast as they were always out late and never up in time, but they spent all week leaving booby traps around the place - you know, clingfilm across the toilet, that kind of thing. As a chalet host, one of the worst things that can happen is that you come in to prepare the breakfast for the morning and you find the clients have come home in the early hours and decided to raid the fridge, eating all the ingredients for that night's meal. You just have to smile and adapt the menu accordingly. You do get some pretty stupid questions sometimes. My favourite was: 'Is my blue jumper going to be warm enough today?' A lot of hosts are asked the question: 'So, what are you going to do for a proper job?' It doesn't go down very well. My top tip is for someone who is going on a chalet ski holiday would be don't forget to take indoor shoes or slippers. You're not allowed to wear your outdoor shoes inside so if you don't have slippers you'll have to just wear socks. Make it known at the start if you're a vegetarian or if you have certain food tastes. With families, it's also important to communicate the catering needs of the children. Some of the guests like to help out with clearing plates, and when the chalet girls or boys have their day off, it's nice if the guests load the dishwasher. It really varies from group to group. Some guests leave it all to the chalet host, which is fair enough. If clients have saved up all year round for a relaxing ski break, we wouldn't expect them to lift a finger. Quite often staff get very nice tips, but it varies. Some weeks you might work really hard and do everything for the guests, and they don't tip at all, and in other weeks they might be very easy guests who don't ask for much and they leave \u00a3200. Ben Mather, 25, works as a chalet host for Neilson Ski in Tignes. This is his third season. The best weeks are when you get people who just come to ski. They're up early for breakfast and out all day so you can get your job done, and they're not out all night drinking. But other people want to burn the candle at both ends. We had a group in their late twenties with a 4am transfer. When I got up to help them depart they were all still up, drunk, and there was wine up the walls. They felt guilty though and left us a fat tip! Last year I had 15 blokes in a rugby team, aged 18-50, who all arrived dressed as Elvis, and completely drunk. On the first night they got through 40 bottles of wine in an hour, and they managed to keep this up pretty much all week. I've never seen anything like it. On the last night, they made Julian (fellow chalet host) and I down a bottle of wine each to earn our \u00a3100 tip and the first one to down it got an extra \u00a350. I won. I think I did it in six seconds! Once I had a kid who I swear was the spawn of Satan! The mum would say, 'I'm just nipping out for a while' then come back two hours later and this kid would just stare at me for the whole two hours. Everywhere I went he would be behind me. That was pretty weird. Snow update AUSTRIA New snow in half of the resorts, Gargellen has 10cm of fresh snow, and 85cm at the bottom, 100cm at the top. Rain in St Anton (55/ 150) and Zurs (100/130).
