Donald Trump recently approved an expanded US military mission to secure oil fields across eastern Syria. His decision locked hundreds of troops into a more complicated presence in Syria and contradicted his own controversial pledge to bring them home. Gen Mark Milley\u2019s announcement came days before Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is due to visit the White House. On Sunday, national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien was asked if war crimes had been carried out Turkish troops or Turkish-backed militias in northern Syria since US troops were withdrawn from the area. \u201cSome of the things that we\u2019ve seen are very disturbing,\u201d he said. Milley told ABC\u2019s This Week: \u201cThere will be less than 1,000 [troops] for sure. And probably in the 500-ish frame. Maybe 600. But it\u2019s in that area. But we\u2019re not going to go into specific numbers because we\u2019re still going through the analysis right now.\u201d The leader of Isis, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was killed in Syria in a US raid last month and Trump has regularly claimed to have defeated the militant group. Critics point out that his decision to withdraw troops from the border with Turkey abandoned Kurdish fighters guarding Isis prisoners amid a Turkish incursion which lead to large-scale escapes. \u201cThere are still Isis fighters in the region,\u201d Milley said, \u201cand unless pressure is maintained, unless attention is maintained on that group, then there\u2019s a very real possibility that conditions could be set for a re-emergence of Isis. So we\u2019re committed to do that. \u201cThe footprint will be small, but the objective will remain the same: the enduring defeat of Isis.\u201d It was unclear if Milley\u2019s prediction included the roughly 200 US troops presently at the al-Tanf garrison in the south of the war-torn country. On CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, O\u2019Brien was asked if he recognised that \u201cwar crimes were committed\u201d during the Turkish incursion into Syria. \u201cSome of the things that we\u2019ve seen are very disturbing,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cMaybe the Turkish supported militias. Turkey has assured us that those are being investigated. We\u2019re very concerned about those issues, the war crimes issues. We\u2019re watching them. We\u2019re monitoring it very closely. \u201cThere is no place for genocide, for ethnic cleansing, for war crimes in the 21st century. The US won\u2019t stand by for it and we\u2019ve made that position very clear to the Turks.\u201d Asked if Trump would veto any new sanctions on Turkey passed by Congress, O\u2019Brien said: \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what happens this week with our meetings with President Erdo\u011fan.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
