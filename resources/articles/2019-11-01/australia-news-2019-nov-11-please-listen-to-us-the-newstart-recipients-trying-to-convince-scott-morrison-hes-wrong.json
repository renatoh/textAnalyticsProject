For more than a month, a Senate inquiry into the Newstart payment has heard first-hand accounts of what life is like for some of Australia\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable people. There have been references to self-harm and suicide. Anger and frustration. And stories of poverty, often set in train by bad luck \u2013 that and the low rate of their welfare payments, which is currently about $280 a week for a single person. Deborah, 61, broke down as she told the inquiry about being made redundant three years ago. \u201cI\u2019ve worked a total of 35 years for Australia,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked 30 of those 35 years in factory work, it\u2019s physical labour. \u201cFrankly I\u2019m scared about what\u2019s going to happen to me when my car rego and my insurances come because there\u2019s no savings. Am I going to be forced to live in my car? \u201cI feel like people like myself deserve to be treated with some respect for our contribution to our country. And to be able to keep some dignity.\u201d The hearings are part of what the Australian Council of Social Service\u2019s (Acoss) chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, calls the \u201cmost important inquiry that\u2019s been undertaken in Australia for 25 years\u201d. Goldie rattled off the stats and facts at a hearing in Sydney. In one of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries, she said, there are still 3 million people live in poverty, including 740,000 children; Newstart has not risen in real terms since 1994; just in Queensland, a $75 per week increase would inject about $748m into local economies across the state. She listed a long list of supporters: the Business Council, unions, John Howard, Dick Smith, Deloitte. Another accounting giant, KPMG, told the inquiry last month it backed an increase of more than $90 a week, larger than the $75 advocated by Acoss and the Greens. Scott Morrison has been unmoved. At hearings in West Perth, Launceston, Alice Springs, Adelaide, Launceston and Sydney, about 30 of Australia\u2019s 700,000 Newstart recipients have popped their heads up above the parapet to convince Morrison he\u2019s wrong, a brave decision in a political environment that has overseen the high-profile demonisation of individual welfare recipients who have dared to speak out. Deborah said she felt \u201cvery sad\u201d and \u201cdemeaned\u201d by the prime minister. In Sydney, Karen, who has been on Newstart for 10 years, has battled homelessness, depression and anxiety. To avoid sleeping on the streets, she tried living with a friend in rooming houses. It never worked out. There was violence and, at a rooming house, she lived with bed bugs. \u201cThe owner of the boarding house refused to get the place fumigated because one of the residents loved collecting live bedbugs in a jar,\u201d she told the inquiry in Sydney. She is now in public housing. After her bills are paid, she\u2019s left with $19 a day to live on. \u201cI have heard media comments that the social welfare system should be a trampoline and not a hammock that people get used to,\u201d Karen said. \u201cThe current low rate of welfare allowance is not a trampoline for people to bounce back up. It is a poverty trap.\u201d Alyx, 56, has also been on Newstart for about a decade. She finds contract work from time to time, but it rarely lasts longer than three months. Before she got into public housing, she was left with $11 a day to live on after she had paid the rent. That was factoring the rent assistance she got on top of Newstart. \u201cI have a bachelor of visual arts degree and an advanced diploma in business management,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m often told I\u2019m overqualified.\u201d As another Newstart recipient, Brenton, 56, put it: \u201cEntry-level positions are clogged with old people.\u201d They are part of the largest cohort of people on the dole: people over 55. The research shows women like Deborah and Alyx are increasingly likely to end up homeless. And government statistics analysed by Guardian Australia show the average time people can expect to spend on Newstart has increased almost every quarter September 2014. \u201cThe heart of the debate about the low rate of Newstart is not just about the consequences that we\u2019re all well aware of; it\u2019s also about the root cause,\u201d Brenton said. He has postgraduate qualifications in the sciences and worked for two decades in IT. Brenton knows the history of the system that he says has kept him poverty. The Americans had \u201cmakers not takers\u201d and the UK had \u201cworkers not shirkers\u201d, he said. In Australia, it\u2019s \u201clifters not leaners\u201d. \u201cThe reason for the government\u2019s resistance to raising Newstart is that that would undermine this whole central policy,\u201d he argued. Asked how he knew so much about the welfare system, Brenton replied: \u201cYou do, when your face is rubbed in it for years.\u201d Coalition senators have defended the government\u2019s position by employing variation on a theme proffered by Morrison: that Labor was engaging in \u201cunfunded empathy\u201d. \u201cI think we can be quite clear on what [Labor\u2019s policy] was. A review of a review, with no budgeting,\u201d Liberal senator Hollie Hughes said. \u201cI think the Australian public have spoken very clearly on that one.\u201d But there have been signs the government acknowledges something needs to change. Hughes, who has appeared for the Coalition with fellow Liberal Wendy Askew, has explored the idea that any additional support for people on Newstart could be \u201ctargeted\u201d. \u201cA blanket cry for an increase in Newstart obviously has significant cost benefits that would impact them potentially in other programs, or have impacts elsewhere,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWe need to be very mindful and apply some intellectual depth to this, to make sure we\u2019re not just doing a blanket application where we can potentially better target what we\u2019re looking at.\u201d During the campaign, Labor sought to imply that its Newstart review would have been like the Harmer process, which led to the largest real terms age pension increase in history. Now, it is explicitly campaigning for an increase, though it won\u2019t name a figure. \u201cThis inquiry represents a broader national discussion, about who we are as a nation \u2013 and whether we are truly prepared to measure ourselves by how we care for our most vulnerable citizens,\u201d Linda Burney, Labor\u2019s social services spokeswoman, said. There is little doubt the opposition\u2019s decision to openly campaign has made a made a difference. Labor teamed up with the Greens to launch the inquiry, a \u201creview\u201d of sorts, led by Rachel Siewert, who has long called for an increase to Newstart. \u201cIt takes a lot of bravery to air your personal experiences when [you are] talking about feelings of worthlessness caused by the system,\u201d the Greens senator says. Siewert is not new to the Senate\u2019s community affairs committee, which often deals with legislation impacting the most vulnerable people in Australia. There is genuine emotion in her voice after the final scheduled hearing of the year in Launceston. \u201cI think the evidence we just heard moved everybody in the room,\u201d Siewert tells Guardian Australia. Deborah said she agreed with another welfare recipient in Launceston, Patrick, when he said: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m being told that it would be better if I just wasn\u2019t here. It would be easier for Australia if I just disappeared.\u201d There will more hearings next year before the committee hands down a report in March. At the end of her appearance, Deborah was asked what she hoped would come from the inquiry. \u201cWhat I would say to the government, \u2018Use a bit of common sense, please,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cA bit of common sense, a bit of compassion \u2026 We don\u2019t deserve to be thrown on the rubbish tip. \u201cSomeone, please listen to us.\u201d Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
