For the first time the budget puts social wellbeing indicators ahead of GDP when it comes to spending decisions. From now on, the health of New Zealand will not be measured by economic growth alone but instead by the overall wellbeing of its nearly 5 million people. The wellbeing budget was promised last year by the left-leaning Labour coalition government, and is a passion project for Robertson and the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern. The two \u2013 who are close friends \u2013 have been united in their commitment to improving the lives of the country\u2019s most vulnerable people, who they say have been left behind in the race for GDP growth. \u201cThis budget responds to New Zealanders\u2019 values. Yes, we want to be a prosperous country, of course we do, but we also care about who shares in that prosperity and how it is sustainable,\u201d says Robertson, 47. \u201cI genuinely think people\u2019s sense of wellbeing is about the broader sense of the community, of the environment, and of their family and the people around them.\u201d He describes the overhaul as a \u201cchallenging\u201d task, but strongly believes it has resulted in better spending decisions, with every penny allocated having the broader wellbeing of New Zealanders in mind. \u201cIt does require a different mindset,\u201d says Robertson. \u201cOne of the reasons we [increased spending] is that once you go down this path, you are going to discover huge unmet need.\u201d Big winners in the wellbeing budget include a record NZ$1.9bn (\u00a3980m) investment for mental health, NZ$1bn for child wellness, as well as a record NZ$320m domestic and sexual violence package. The country has some of the highest rates of child poverty and domestic violence in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),as well as the highest youth suicide rate. Robertson says past governments didn\u2019t value wellbeing in the race for GDP growth, and investments are not only social, but include significant increases for the Ministry for the Environment and the Ministry of Housing, as well as a record NZ$1bn for KiwiRail \u2013 part of the government\u2019s plan to be carbon-neutral by 2050. \u201cThe constant refrain was, if we\u2019ve got this so-called rockstar economy, how is it that we have the worst homelessness in the OECD? How is it that you can\u2019t swim in most of New Zealand\u2019s rivers and lakes? How is it that child poverty had grown to the extent it has?\u201d Robertson says. \u201cThe answer, in my view, was because the government wasn\u2019t sufficiently valuing those things. And if it wasn\u2019t being valued properly, it wasn\u2019t being measured, and if it wasn\u2019t being measured, it wasn\u2019t being done.\u201d Frontline services for mental health \u2013 practitioners in every GP practice, student health centres and clinics for Indigenous New Zealanders \u2013 will cost the government NZ$0.5bn, equivalent to NZ$380 of mental health funding for every citizen. The aim is to help \u201cthe missing middle\u201d: the New Zealanders struggling with widespread and growing rates of mild-to-moderate depression and anxiety. \u201cIf you are acutely mentally unwell in New Zealand, there are good services available to you. But if you\u2019re at the mild-to-moderate end of the spectrum, we do not have the services to support you,\u201d Robertson says bluntly. Should the UK follow suit? After all, the Welsh government\u2019s 2015 Wellbeing of Future Generations Act, requires public bodies in Wales to take into account the social, cultural, environmental and economic impact of decisions. \u201cI think this approach could be applied anywhere,\u201d says Robertson. \u201cWhat I haven\u2019t seen anywhere before is the end-to-end nature. Its no good just having a scorecard of different indicators of success. Its also using that information to inform your investments \u2013 that\u2019s how it becomes a true wellbeing budget.\u201d Robertson\u2019s view of wellbeing includes living a balanced, purposeful and meaningful life. He says he has nailed the last two, but is currently struggling with \u201cbalance\u201d. He\u2019d like to cook more for friends and family, and get to the gym. He\u2019s had his own struggles with poor mental health too. \u201cI think of my own experience as a teenager coming to terms with being gay, I definitely had quite big struggles then. I really wasn\u2019t coping at certain points of my teenage years,\u201d remembers Robertson, who now has a long-term partner. \u201cI had one particular incident involving alcohol that was very, very dangerous. And had the potential to end my life.\u201d The finance minister says there is a lot more to do. Next year\u2019s budget will apply wellbeing principles to \u201ccore baseline spending\u201d. That means schools funding, acute hospital services, and roads and transport spending. Robertson says there\u2019s no going back \u2013 at least on his watch. \u201cI strongly believe this is a much better set of budget documents than we would have produced if we\u2019d just stuck to the tried and true,\u201d says Robertson. \u201cThe way we\u2019re talking very much reflects M\u0101ori and Pasifika world views \u2013 that your wellbeing is made up of a holistic idea.\u201d Curriculum vitae Age: 47.
