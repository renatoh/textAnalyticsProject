Legal &amp; General, HBOS - which owns Clerical Medical - and Foreign &amp; Colonial have imposed an immediate ban on lending their shares to third parties, while Prudential has made a similar decision but restricted it to sectors particularly vulnerable to sharp falls such as airlines and insurance companies. The controversial move by the four - which between them control more than \u00a3400bn of assets - is designed to make it impossible for speculative investors such as hedge funds to sell shares for short-term gain and exacerbate falls in already nervous markets. Until now it has been common practice for big investors such as pension funds and insurers to lend the shares they own to short-term speculators in return for a small fee. These speculators then \"short\" the market by selling the shares at current levels with a view to buying them back when prices have fallen further, thereby making a profit on their trade. But the current turbulence in the market after the terrorist attacks in the United States has prompted a rethink in the City about the practice. Although the blue-chip index closed 188 points higher at 4,613 yesterday, it is still 420 points or 8% lower than when the attacks were launched on September 11. The move is likely to widen the debate among the biggest investors as to whether there should be an industry-wide block on stock lending. The issue is already on the agenda at the Association of British Insurers which yesterday fell short of endorsing a blanket ban. The recent sharp falls in the stock market also forced the City regulator, the financial services authority, to take action to avert further stock market falls. The FSA yesterday confirmed that it has told leading insurance companies that they should not feel forced into selling their share portfolios to comply with its rules. The weight of large-scale share sales by insurers - which own 25% of the stock market - could further accelerate falls in the market. Such is the extent of the stock market turbulence that the FSA is understood to be preparing to tear up its resilience test, its measure of insurance companies' solvency. Even before the terrorist attacks it had relaxed its rules because of the falls in the financial markets. It is not clear how many insurance companies are breaching their solvency tests but research by Schroder Salomon Smith Barney warned that two-thirds of the country's life insurers would face a severe test of their financial strength if the FTSE 100 ended the year below 4,850. Yesterday's move by the four institutions is also aimed at restoring more stability to the market. HBOS, which has 1m small investors whose savings are being affected by the current turmoil, said: \"We're not in the business of providing a blank cheque to other players so they can short our investors' money.\" L&amp;G said it was not in its interests to encourage short selling. The ABI called for greater transparency on stock lending but refused to call for an industry-wide ban. \"It is up to individual consciences,\" said Peter Montagnon, head of investments. \"Stock lending is also an important source of liquidity for the market.\" The view is shared by Barclays Global Investors which is continuing its practice of stock lending, in which it has been engaged in for more than 20 years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
