The victim \u2013 who health authorities named as 15-year-old Alvanei Xirixana \u2013 died on Thursday night after spending almost a week in intensive care in Boa Vista, a Brazilian city near the Yanomami\u2019s Portugal-sized reserve. The Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper reported that Xirixana was from Rehebe, a village along the Uraricoera River which wildcat goldminers use to illegally access the mineral-rich territory. The website Amaz\u00f4nia Real said the village\u2019s 70 or so members had been isolated, as well as the victim\u2019s parents, five health workers and a local pilot. It was not clear how or where the teenager, who reportedly lived outside the reserve, had become infected, although reports have suggested Yanomami leaders suspect illegal gold prospectors could be responsible for bringing coronavirus into their 26,000-strong community. The teenager\u2019s death has rekindled painful memories for the Yanomami as well as fears over the coronavirus\u2019s potential to wreak havoc on indigenous communities across South America. Carlo Zaquini, an Italian missionary who has worked with the Yanomami in Brazil for more than half a century, watched Yanomami communities brought to their knees during the 1970s and 1980s by epidemics caused by an influx of roadbuilders and gold miners. \u201cIt was like driving a bulldozer into a glass factory. Everything was shattered. It was one epidemic after another,\u201d Zaquini, 82, remembered of that period. \u201cIn some of the villages I knew measles killed 50% of the population. If Covid does the same thing it would be a massacre,\u201d he added. Brazilian health authorities have so far detected 24 suspected coronavirus cases among the country\u2019s 850,000-strong indigenous population, according to the official news agency, Ag\u00eancia Brasil. \u201cIndigenous people have lived with epidemics brought by the white man since the 16th century,\u201d columnist Bernardo Mello Franco wrote in Brazil\u2019s O Globo newspaper this week. \u201cNow, with the arrival of coronavirus, the threat is back.\u201d Up to 20,000 illegal goldminers called garimpeiros are believed to be working in the area inhabited by the Yanomami along Brazil\u2019s border with Venezuela. Sofia Mendon\u00e7a, a Brazilian public health physician who works with indigenous communities, said their eviction was essential if indigenous lives were to be saved. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get these people out of the [indigenous] areas the chance of contagion is much greater,\u201d Mendon\u00e7a warned. Zaquini said he hoped health authorities were better prepared to protect the Yanomami than during past epidemics, with dozens of health posts now existing within their reserve. \u201cThere are some things in the past that left me traumatized and I hope these things don\u2019t repeat themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I view the current situation with real, real pessimism.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
