The changes come after the conservative Daily Caller and others reported that several passages from Biden\u2019s plan appeared to borrow from policy papers and statements written by outside groups without citation. A Biden campaign statement read: \u201cSeveral citations, some from sources cited in other parts of the plan, were inadvertently left out of the final version of the 22-page document.\u201d The added citations included passages from documents published by the Blue Green Alliance and the Carbon Capture Coalition. The document by Biden, vice-president under Barack Obama, cites sources in the text of the plan. Some other campaigns use more formal footnotes in their policy papers. Biden\u2019s 1988 presidential campaign ended amid controversy over plagiarized passages in his campaign speech and after he admitted plagiarism on a law school paper. At the time, Biden said the incident at Syracuse University was a matter of him not knowing the proper way to document sources. David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist and architect of Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, was skeptical that the errors in Biden\u2019s climate policy proposal will affect his campaign. \u201cThere are many, many molehills that look like mountains during a campaign,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cThe challenge for the campaigns and the press is to decide which is which.\u201d Yet Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign wasted little time in trying to capitalize. \u201cFour decades in public life and there\u2019s always one constant. What would a Joe Biden candidacy be without a little plagiarism?\u201d said Tim Murtaugh, the campaign communications director."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
