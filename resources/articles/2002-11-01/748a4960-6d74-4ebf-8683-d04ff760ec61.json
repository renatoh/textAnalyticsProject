Westerveld, who was sold to Real Sociedad after Houllier bought Dudek from PSV Eindhoven and Chris Kirkland from Coventry hours before last season's European transfer deadline, would agree. His last game for Liverpool featured a howler when he let a shot through his legs and the Reds lost 2-1 at Bolton. He still feels bitter at his subsequent treatment by Houllier. \"The possibility of a new keeper arriving was going round and round in my head during the Bolton game,\" said Westerveld. \"Then I made that mistake. I just thought 'that's it, it's over'. On the coach home I knew I'd played my last game. That was exactly the stick Houllier needed to beat me with. \"I knew before the game that something was going on. A couple of journalists in Holland warned me that Liverpool were dealing with Dudek, and his agent has since told me that they'd been negotiating for six weeks. But Houllier told me that the rumours were lies.\" Westerveld claims the Liverpool manager often told him that he could be the best keeper in the world. \"But all the while he was negotiating with Dudek. Everything happened behind my back. If Liverpool had bought one keeper I would have stayed and fought for my place. I didn't want to leave. I asked Houllier for an explanation and he just said I made too many mistakes. \"Houllier has to accept that goalkeepers will let in goals and make mistakes. Especially the way he likes to play. Liverpool's style makes things even more difficult for a keeper. Being so defensive, so solid, means you don't see much of the ball and keeping your concentration is tough.\" The Liverpool manager is likely to resist recalling St\u00e9phane Henchobut should hand Steven Gerrard a first start since the 3-3 draw in Basle which poleaxed their Champions League prospects and prompted a stinging verbal backlash from Houllier. \"From our training I'd say we are coming out of that blip but you wonder if the players have their minds on United,\" he said. \"I've no regrets being in this competition rather than the Champions League. The only thing is that Champions League football would have brought more experience to my players, but Arnhem in the Uefa Cup will still be a fruitful exercise.\" Vitesse Arnhem (4-4-2; probable): Jevric; Cornelisse, Zimman, Stefanovic, Frankel; Mustapha, Classens, Levchenko, Jansen; Amoha, Peeters. Liverpool (4-4-2; probable): Dudek; Babbel, Hyypia, Traore, Carragher; Murphy, Gerrard, Hamann, Riise; Smicer; Owen.
