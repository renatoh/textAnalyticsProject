Scott Murray is presiding over the dregs of Liverpool v Everton, which has been disappointingly goalless for the entire second half (though the MBM will certainly be sizzling). Bye! One more match report for you: here\u2019s David Hytner from Old Trafford: The sight of Marcus Rashford in smooth and pacy flow \u2013 the components of his thrilling technique in sync from first to last \u2013 would once have delighted Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. Not here. Mourinho had wanted to mark his return to Manchester United with a fourth win on the spin with Tottenham; to make his biggest statement yet with his new club. Instead, Rashford comprehensively upstaged him, scoring both of the goals in a United victory that ought to have been more emphatic, such was their first-half domination, to provide his current manager, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, with a sorely needed tonic. Much more here: Pete Lansley was at Molineux to see West Ham\u2019s seventh defeat in 10: The biggest challenge for Wolves on their way to fifth place in the Premier League and the knockout stages of the Europa League has been how well their back-up cast can come in for the regulars. So Patrick Cutrone\u2019s clinching goal four minutes from time, after the Italian was teed up by fellow substitute Pedro Neto, could prove crucial in a month when Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s men play eight games. Much more here: Ben Fisher was our man in Southampton for the Saints\u2019 victory over Norwich: With a handful of minutes left to play, Southampton didn\u2019t know what to do with themselves, unsure whether to eke their way through stoppage time or find a third goal to kill the game. They retreated until they could no more, surviving to see off Norwich City. Such trepidation was understandable given March was the last time they recorded back-to-back league wins. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s side held on to savour victory, with first-half goals by Danny Ings and Ryan Bertrand paving the way for victory to delight supporters, who have been starved of these kind of gritty displays for too long. Much more here: Paul Doyle was at the King Power Stadium to watch the Leicester bandwagon keep rolling: It is extraordinary that this is becoming business as usual. For the seventh Premier League game in a row, Jamie Vardy scored and Leicester won. This was their most stuttering performance during that run and Vardy needed a second-half penalty to make the breakthrough against the league\u2019s bottom team before James Maddison netted in stoppage time, but Leicester made sure they took maximum points. That is what they do now. Much more here: The match reports are landing! Here\u2019s Jacob Steinberg\u2019s from Stamford Bridge: Once the tributes to John Terry were done, Chelsea got on with showing their former captain the future. There is no place for sentiment in the heat of battle and Frank Lampard\u2019s academy products made sure Aston Villa\u2019s assistant manager did not enjoy his big homecoming too much, earning three important points thanks to excellent goals from Tammy Abraham and Mason Mount. This was a fine victory for Chelsea after their aberration against West Ham. Mount was back to his enterprising best in midfield and Lampard\u2019s side, sitting pretty in fourth place, did well to regain their poise after gifting Villa a soft equaliser on the stroke of half-time. Chelsea created countless chances during the second half and Terry must have known the visitors, a point above the bottom three, were fortunate not to lose by more. Much more here: In all five of the 7.30pm kick-offs the home side scored two goals and won. The last to finish is at the King Power Stadium, where a dodgy penalty and a slightly lucky 95th-minute goal brought Leicester victory over Watford, who had one shot on target in the entire game (and that in the 95th minute). Chelsea pocket all the points and probably should have won more comfortably. They had 25 shots, which strikes me as rather a lot. A deserved win for Manchester United, who played superbly for periods of this game. They leapfrog Spurs and sit sixth! And that\u2019ll seal it! Maddison tries to push the ball past Mariappa and it deflects of both of the defender\u2019s leg and back to Maddison, who runs into the area before beating Foster! And that\u2019s the last chance at St Mary\u2019s, with the final whistle blowing within seconds. With Everton losing, as it stands Southampton are out of the bottom three! A chance for a 93rd-minute equaliser at St Mary\u2019s Stadium, but Sam Byram hits his first effort into a thicket of legs, and his second wide! The final whistle blows at Molineux, and Wolves pocket the points. With Tottenham losing, as things stand they\u2019re fifth tonight. Save from Kepa! Aston Villa swing the ball into the area, and Douglas Luiz rises highest and gets a header on target, which Kepa dives to push away! \u201cCan someone at Guardian towers please explain why it wasn\u2019t possible yesterday to MBM two matches simultaneously (even though Max Rushden was watching the one not covered), yet tonight you are not only doing four matches, but also the one which has its own MBM?\u201d asks Harvey Mayne. a) manpower issues, I expect; b) five matches, I think you\u2019ll find. Wolves seal the win at Molineux! Good work from Raul Jimenez to carry the ball from the left flank into the area, and it\u2019s then touched back into the path of Cutrone, who tucks it just inside the post from the edge of the box! \u201cCould it be that Jose Mourinho has managed to compress time as we might be witnessing the third (league) game syndrome as opposed to usual third season syndrome?\u201d wonders Admir Pajic. The match stats from Anfield make interesting reading: Liverpool have had four shots on target; Everton have had two shots on target ... and it\u2019s 4-2! I\u2019m a bit late in discovering these completely legal Twitter goal videos, but here are a couple of highlights: What a stop! Willian sends a free-kick dipping towards the top-right corner of the net, but Heaton flings himself to his left and gets his fingertips on it, to send it onto the post! It\u2019s half-time at Anfield. Liverpool have abandoned their recent 2-1 habit, and are instead dealing in multiples of the same scoreline. A cross from the left, and Richarlison completely misses with his attempted diving header but accidentally shoulders it into the far corner! Chance for Tammy Abraham! Willian slides the ball into the box, and Abraham clips it towards, but just past, the far post! Another fabulous counter-attack! From an Everton corner Van Dijk heads away to Man\u00e9, who passes left to Alexander-Arnold. He sprints most of the pitch, ignores the completely-unmarked-throughout Shaqiri on the right and instead nudges infield to Man\u00e9, whose first-time finish is perfection! So Jamie Vardy has now scored in seven successive league games. It\u2019s been an exceptional night of football, I think: controversy, quality, and some brilliant, brilliant goals. Dele Alli\u2019s is the highlight so far. Now that\u2019s a finish! Ings shoots just wide for Southampton and Norwich run down the other end, Tettey plays an excellent pass into the left side of the penalty area, and Pukki runs through before lashing a left-footer inside the near post! You\u2019ve got to worry about Watford now. They have played pretty well thus far, but this team only know one way to react to adversity, and that\u2019s badly. As I type that, though, Vardy is played in and dinks the ball over the onrushing Foster, only for Masina to fling a leg out and deflect it over the bar! Lovren catches 60-yard-wonderpassitis! The Liverpool centre-back pings the ball over the entire Everton team, and Origi emphatically outpaces the Everton defence, controls the ball with a brilliant first touch, and then lifts it over Pickford and into the net! Foster stands his ground, and Vardy sends the ball to his left! The foul, such as it was, was committed by Adam Masina on Jonny Evans. Masina was keeping him at arm\u2019s length, so did indeed touch him, but it was a very odd decision. Now Leicester do have a penalty! Or do they? There\u2019s a long VAR check, and he points to the spot! That is a 100% pure make-up penalty award, because the Foxes should have had one in the first half. That, though, looks harsh. Rashford is tripped by Sissoko as he bursts into the area, and the referee points to the spot! The England forward gets up, brushes himself down, sends Gazzaniga the wrong way and sidefoots his penalty into the net! Everton pull one back! From a short corner Iwobi\u2019s cross deflects into Kean\u2019s path, leaving him with a simple finish! Into the second half, and someone has already turned on the goal tap! Willian crosses, Abraham chests it down, and Mount thumps a right-foot volley into the roof of the net from a yard or two behind the penalty spot! Liverpool stretch their lead! Alexander-Arnold starts the move with an insane 60-yard crossfield pass upfield to Mane, whose pass picks out Shaqiri\u2019s run into the area, and he taps it past Pickford! That\u2019s a fantastic break. \u201cDele, seems he\u2019s a one-off physical specimen,\u201d complains Peter Littley, \u201cshoulders stretch all the way to his elbows.\u201d You can\u2019t seriously be telling me you think that goal should have been disallowed? Some half-time reading for you, just in case you\u2019re at a loose end: History has been made at Stamford Bridge: That\u2019s a lovely break from the league leaders! Mane carries the ball down the left, into Everton\u2019s half, and then curls a fabulous left-footed pass around Keane and perfectly into Origi\u2019s path! Pickford rushes out of goal but loses the race to the ball, the Belgian\u2019s first touch takes it past him, and his second sends it into an empty net! It is half time in all the 7.30 kick-offs, so have yourself a breather. Though they\u2019re just five minutes into things at Anfield, so make it a quick one. Looking back at that Trezeguet goal, it is an absolutely classic hilarious slapstick finish. The Egyptian\u2019s header is completely hopeless, but he actually heads it straight down and into his own shin, and it bounces off his shin and into goal! \u201cThank goodness VAR let that Alli goal stand,\u201d writes Rob Moore. \u201cI\u2019m no fan of either Spurs or Man Utd, but that goal was worthy of all the superlatives. To have it ruled out for a graze on a shirt shoulder would be tragic.\u201d It was a fabulous goal, no doubt about it, and though it might have just brushed a bit of fabric in his shoulder area, it was not a handball or even near one. Chance for Watford! Deulofeu slides the ball across the edge of the area to Hughes, who has a fabulous chance! His shot, though, hits Deeney and goes wide. Another set piece for Southampton, and another goal! It\u2019s a corner from the right, which Long flicks on and Bertrand taps in at the back stick! A cross from the right, and everyone thinks it\u2019s going to be met at the near post, including Trezeguet by the looks of things. It misses two players at the near post, hits Trezeguet and bounces in! And after all that dominance, United are pegged back! And what a finish that is from Dele Alli! It\u2019s a cross from the left that goes through to the right, where a shot is blasted goalwards. De Gea beats it away, but Dele Alli, with his back to goal, gets to it, flicks it up and over his head before spinning and volleying it in! It\u2019s a lovely, lovely goal - but did it brush his upper arm? VAR checks, and (quite rightly, in my opinion) says no! Leicester in VAR penalty controversy! Vardy goes down in the area as Mariappa challenges, but the referee is unimpressed and books the Leicester striker for his troubles. VAR checks it, and it looks very much like a penalty from where I\u2019m sitting, even if Vardy fell over in a slightly unnatural way, but it\u2019s not overturned. At Molineux Jota has a pop from the edge of the area, but Martin remains resolute for West Ham, and pushes the ball away. Chance for Leicester! Lovely build-up as Barnes comes inside from the left, plays a couple of little one-twos and bursts into the area, but when he finally gets round to shooting Foster saves it. At Stamford Bridge, Aston Villa win a corner, then another corner, then another corner. Then corner No4 is cleared and suddenly Chelsea have a 3 v 2 break, but Abraham tries to pass inside to Pulisic rather than go for goal himself, and hits a defender. Meanwhile in Scotland, it\u2019s Aberdeen v Rangers and one of the players has been hit with a pie thrown from the stands. Now Lingard shoots just wide! Tottenham are getting overrun here, and it could be time for a Jose Mourinho first-half substitution special. Gazzaniga got a touch to that Rashford shot, so that goes down in the big bumper book of great stops. Now Rashford pings a lovely shot against the bar from 30 yards! That\u2019s a cracking effort, and United could have this game wrapped up by now. Save! James sends in a low cross from the right and the ball hits a few legs before dropping to Greenwood, whose hard, low effort is well stopped by Gazzaniga! And another one! It\u2019s a lovely ball into the box from Reece James, which tempts the keeper into no-man\u2019s land but lands on Abraham\u2019s head, and he nods it into an empty net! Another set-piece goal! It\u2019s a corner from the left, nobody stops Dendoncker\u2019s bulldozing run into the six-yard box, and he touches it back across goal and inside the post with an outstretched boot! James Ward-Prowse sends a lovely free-kick in from the left wing, and any kind of touch at the near post and the keeper was in big trouble. Ings gets the touch, and in it goes! Some kind of snooker-themed celebration follows. Oooh! Rashford sends a free-kick whistling not far wide of goal at Old Trafford. Meanwhile at Stamford Bridge, Mason Mount meets a right-wing cross but his header is straight at Heaton. At Old Trafford, Winks is booked for taking out Daniel James and sending the youngster flying down the little slope at the edge of the pitch, into Jose Mourinho, and onto the paved pitchside walkway bit. He looks hurt for a while, then he gets up and stops looking hurt. You\u2019ve got to love a good aerial duel photo. Deeney, possibly in this very challenge, has already made Soyuncu aware of his presence, using the traditional inadvertent aerial forearm smash. United aren\u2019t just leading Spurs, they\u2019re roaring at them with real vim every time they get the ball. It\u2019s all extremely encouraging for the home side. The ball breaks to Rashford on the left-hand corner of the penalty area. He carries it forward a couple of yards and then lashes a shot towards the near post, which bounces unkindly just before Gazzaniga, who fingertips it into the post and in! Perez gets another chance at the King Power, and this time his shot goes so wide one of his team-mates manages to stop it going out for a throw-in. Ludicrous miss! Leicester should be ahead in the third minute, after Vardy roars into space down the left, cuts inside and taps the ball to Perez, who is running unmolested into the penalty area. He need only pick his spot, and the spot he picks is towards the back of the stand! Peeeeeep! The Leicester and Chelsea matches get under way on time. Everyone else seems to be lagging behind. OK, our players are in their tunnels. Time for action (nearly)! Scott Murray is all over the Merseyside derby, by the way. You can find his liveblog here: Here are the teams from Anfield, where Liverpool spring a surprise by dropping Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino to the bench for the derby. Xherdan Shaqiri starts his first game since January, and Divock Origi and Adam Lallana both also come in. Everton, by contrast, are unchanged: Liverpool: Adrian, Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, Van Dijk, Robertson, Wijnaldum, Lallana, Milner, Shaqiri, Mane, Origi. Subs: Keita, Firmino, Salah, Gomez, Henderson, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Kelleher. Everton: Pickford, Sidibe, Holgate, Mina, Keane, Digne, Iwobi, Davies, Sigurdsson, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin. Subs: Baines, Walcott, Tosun, Schneiderlin, Bernard, Kean, Lossl. Referee: Mike Dean. Hayden Mullins, Watford\u2019s caretaker manager, has a brief pre-match chat: It\u2019s been a whirlwind couple of days. We\u2019ve been setting up quite a bit, loads to do, but they\u2019ve been very good. it\u2019s taken a lot of preparation, trying to set up in a positive way. We want to come here and put on a good performance. Any game in the Premier League is tough. We\u2019ve got a gameplan, we\u2019ve got a job we\u2019re going to try to do. We can do that by pulling in the same direction, and hopefully we can get a result. It doesn\u2019t look like Tom Heaton is enjoying his warm-up very much: Here\u2019s a bit of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s pre-match chat: There\u2019s a couple of injuries, and Scott\u2019s back fit to play so that was an easy decision. Ashley Young\u2019s very important for us. He\u2019s one of the leaders and it\u2019s important to have experience in these big games. Mason\u2019s a young boy but he\u2019s getting his chance now. I\u2019ve been waiting to see him in the Premier League, and of course it\u2019s a big stage against a big team, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s ready. \u201cI\u2019m a teacher in Montreal, Canada. I\u2019m also a massive Liverpool fan,\u201d writes Pierre-Yves. \u201cI took the day off to watch the Merseyside derby. Does this make me a bad human or a bad teacher or both?\u201d I\u2019d say it doesn\u2019t give us quite enough evidence to be sure on either count, but it does provide a decent clue. Sue Smith, who is on punditry duties at Molineux, has the most incredible hair. There\u2019s lots of it, but it doesn\u2019t move at all. It\u2019s like a wavy bicycle helmet. She\u2019s got an absolutely fantastic hairdo history, very much worth an image search. Watford come up against one of their many former managers at the King Power Stadium. Leicester are unexpectedly without Ben Chilwell, who is replaced at left-back by Christian Fuchs. Watford also make one change, with their interim manager Hayden Mullins bringing Troy Deeney in and leaving Jose Holebas out (apparently he\u2019s injured). That suggests a switch back to four at the back, with a Deulofeu-Deeney-Sarr front three that might be genuinely dangerous (against lesser teams, anyway). At Molineux the managers have only gently massaged their teams. Romain Saiss returns from suspension for the home side, replacing Max Kilman, while West Ham bring in the recently goal-shy Sebastian Haller, who has scored just once in his last 11 games, for the injured Michail Antonio. Meanwhile in Southampton, Ralph Hasenhuttl gives Shane Long only his second league start of the season, dropping Michael Obafemi to the bench. Norwich stick with the starting XI which drew 2-2 against Arsenal. Quite a lot of team changing going on. At Old Trafford Manchester United bring in four, with Scott McTominay returning from injury and Mason Greenwood making his first league start of the campaign. Jesse Lingard and Ashley Young are also in. Tottenham make two changes, with Harry Winks and Lucas Moura replacing Tanguy Ndombele and Eric Dier. Amazon do a sweep around the grounds, providing evidence that they have basically hired every football pundit known to man.

We have six top-flight fixtures on our menu this evening/morning/whatever-it-is-where-you-are, including a Merseyside derby (which gets its own liveblog elsewhere, and kicks off 45 minutes after every other game, but we\u2019ll still be monitoring). The teams first, third and fourth in the table all play at home, with Leicester hosting managerless crisis club Watford and Chelsea welcoming Aston Villa, while Southampton, having seen off the Hornets and landed a killer blow on their briefly-manager Quique Sanches Flores in their last outing, play their second consecutive win-or-bust bottom-three humdinger as Norwich come to town. In other news Jos\u00e9 Mourinho returns to Old Trafford with Tottenham, and the division\u2019s bottom two sides (on alphabetical order) play at Molineux, where it\u2019s Wolves v West Ham. Frankly there isn\u2019t a dud among them. So welcome. Sit yourself down, strap yourself in, and prepare for blast off! Kick-offs: 7.30pm GMT, 8.15pm GMT at Anfield."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
