It found that UK-based entrepreneurs have built 72 such businesses in the past 20 years, including 13 in the past year, with only the US and China surpassing that number. Germany has 29 and India has 26. More than a third of Europe\u2019s fastest-growing tech companies are based in Britain, according to the study for the government-led Digital Economy Council, whose members include techUK, Google, Facebook, BT and Apple. It said that, over the same period, the US and China had created 703 and 206 tech firm respectively. The food delivery service Deliveroo and Revolut, an online money transfer app, are among the startup firms to have become \u201cunicorns\u201d in recent years \u2013 a term coined for a private company valued at more than \u00a31bn. The study comes as global tech companies promised to invest more than \u00a31.2bn in the UK. The prime minister, Theresa May, will announce the business pledge on Monday to mark the opening of London Tech Week. May will also commit the government to invest \u00a3153m in the development of quantum computing, with an additional \u00a3205m pledged by the industry with a focus on how the technology could be used to accelerate drug development. The PM will say: \u201cAlready we are one of the best places in the world to start and grow a tech business. \u201cBritish tech is growing over one-and-a-half times faster than the rest of the economy, adding more than \u00a3130bn to our economy every year. \u201cBut if we are going to maintain our position as a global leader, our challenge is how we develop British tech and make it even better. \u201cWe want this to be the place everyone thinks of \u2013 and comes to \u2013 first when they want to develop their world-changing tech ideas. This is a challenge shared between industry and government.\u201d The outgoing prime minister will host a roundtable for leading technology firms, including Microsoft UK, Google and the mobile bank Monzo. The announcements will include the availability of 2,500 places on artificial intelligence and data conversion courses to start next year along with the launch of a study into technology competitiveness, which will look to identify ways to ensure the UK remains attractive to businesses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
