But Damian Cruden has decided to steer his production away from adult pantomime and do more with Dumas than one might have thought possible. Richard Hurford's adaptation provides a serviceable means of getting from A to B via plenty of fencing, but Cruden builds on this to craft stage pictures of real style and imagination. He is brilliantly aided by Dawn Allsopp's design, in which a stern Parisian facade crumbles to become a blasted provincial battlement. Billowing red curtains and Christopher Madin's propulsive music keep time and place in perpetual motion. Wayne Dowdeswell's sombre, gun-metal lighting oppressively hangs over proceedings like a pall, as silhouettes of angry citizens break through the mist. It's like Les Mis\u00e9rables minus the guillotine. Cruden's most audacious touch is to emphasise the story's prophetic echoes of the revolution. The Musketeers are less the jolly rogering roisterers of old than a slightly embarrassing spent force. From this interesting psychological platform, Cruden coaxes some arresting performances from an excellent cast. As the original three musketeers, there are poignantly menopausal performances from Tim Welton, Oliver Boot and John Paul Connolly as Athos, the melancholic one, Aramis, the religious one, and Porthos, the one who ate all the pies. John Kirk is engagingly wet behind the ears as the ambitious D'Artagnan, while Matthew Rixon's Cardinal Richelieu is a sinister study in scarlet. Only Martin Barrass's petulant Louis XIII camps things up - but he's allowed to because he's king. The most complex performance of the evening comes from Dumas's most intriguing character. Phoebe Soteriades has an ice-queen's hauteur as the enigmatic Milady de Winter, the branded whore in duchess's robes with sidelines in swordsmanship and poison. Her defiant death-speech is a shattering climax given the force of a historical turning-point. She may be about to be skewered by four vengeful swordsmen, but we are left in no doubt that seedy royalists in frilly sleeves will be first for the chop when the revolution comes. \u0095 Until September 1.
