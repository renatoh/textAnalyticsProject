Ministers hope the competition will generate techniques to improve the surveillance and detection of potential terrorist threats. Ben Wallace, the security minister, will announce the funding at a meeting in London on Monday. He is expected to say: \u201cThe threat from terror does not stand still, so neither will we, which is why we are calling on the best and the brightest from the science and technology sector to come forward with their ideas and proposals to support our ongoing work to keep people safe.\u201d Britain has been the target of a series of terrorist attacks this year that took place in busy locations or crowded spaces. \u201cIn light of the horrific attacks in London and Manchester, the government has committed to review its counter-terror strategy,\u201d Wallace will say. \u201cFurther to this I am announcing today that we are making up to \u00a32m available to fund research into cutting-edge technology and behavioural science projects designed to keep people safe in crowds.\u201d Counter-terror agencies are running 500 investigations involving 3,000 individuals at any one time as they confront an unprecedented threat. The competition is seeking research proposals to reduce the threat from terrorist attacks involving weapons or explosives. The scheme will be run in partnership between the Home Office and Defence and Security Accelerator, which was launched last year to seek out security innovations for the security services and police, with support from the Royal Society. Lucy Mason, head of the Defence and Security Accelerator, said: \u201cWe must bring together the brightest minds from the private sector and academia to help find solutions to keep our country and people safe and secure.\u201d Mason encouraged anyone who feels they have an idea to help keep crowded areas safe to visit the Accelerator website for more information."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
