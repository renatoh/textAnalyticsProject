What are they like? We know they hate the brown people. But hey, they hate each other too. Yesterday the Labour MP Jon Cruddas, whose Dagenham constituency includes their stronghold, told of a sorry mess. Fifty-eight organisers have recently resigned, he informed the Commons. Eight councillors have resigned the whip. \"The BNP have posted on their website a recording and transcript of a conversation between two people who were later sacked,\" he said. They believe \"that their house, phone or computer has been bugged\". He said members of the \"BNP security\" service entered the house of Sadie Graham, a BNP councillor in the East Midlands, by deception and took her property, including her computer which held the names and addresses of constituents. Citing inquiries by Searchlight, Cruddas spoke of funds unaccounted for, electoral rules transgressed, and tax liabilities unresolved. Of activities illegal in terms of \"data protection, bugging, theft and the operation of the political parties\". The party denies wrongdoing and we must accept that. But it's not the tightest ship. \u00b7 He came, he saw, and he brought her back. But Lord Ahmed didn't do it alone. An essential member of the team that flew to Sudan to rescue Gillian Gibbons - the teacher who called a teddy bear Muhammad - was Baroness Warsi, vice-chair of the Conservative party. His glory was her glory. Any credit gained by Labour also went - in excessive measure, some complain - to the Tories. So why did Lord Ahmed turn to Baroness Warsi, disgruntled activists are asking. He said he was advised to travel with a female Muslim parliamentarian. Why not Baroness Uddin, a female, a Muslim and a Labour peer? Last year, he was forced to deny allegations that he sought to help Baroness Warsi back in 2005 as she fought Labour's Shahid Malik for the Dewsbury constituency - and now there is muttering about misplaced allegiances. Still, Gillian Gibbons is home and settled. Someone's happy. \u00b7 So what did we learn from that episode? More tolerance? A better understanding of the sensitivities? One might say yes, were it not for some viewers of London Tonight - who were asked to help name a newly born lamb as the programme broadcast live from an animal centre. Seventeen said Muhammad, while one emailed the suggestion Mistletoe. So Mistletoe it is. Welcome to the world. \u00b7 \"Not my week,\" said MP Lynne Featherstone, who ran Chris Huhne's failed leadership campaign, reflecting afterwards on newstatesman.com. \"First X-Factor's Leon and now Nick!\" Some say Nick has the better voice, and Leon the more finely tuned political antennae, but the members have spoken. What's done is done. \u00b7 Mixed messages on the environment from the TUC, which will host a one-day conference at the University of London in February to discuss climate change. Those attending wonder whether the general secretary, Brendan Barber, will use his chauffeur driven car, as he is one of the few trade union leaders to retain one. Recently he put his driver to work collecting takeaways during the talks at the TUC to broker a deal in the Royal Mail dispute. \"We went through the menus of the local Indian, pizza and fish and chip restaurants a couple of times,\" he said. We must move fast to save the world. But we also need to eat. \u00b7 Joy at the arrival of Fabio Capello transcends our borders, for the Italians can now claim credit for any success the England team enjoys. And also happy to see the issue settled are the Scots. In the knowledge that Fabio's English is, as he describes it, \"not so well\", and mindful of the history, reader Iain Montgomery from Glasgow suggests a few key phrases necessary for England's new man. There's Chi vuole prendere il primo rigore? (Who wants to take the first penalty?) E'ancora matematicamente possibile. (It's still mathematically possible.) or Egli e ferito - nuovamente. (He's injured - again.) And, of course, there is E la nonna Inglese? (Is his grandmother English?) Thanks for that, Iain. Good when we all pull together. diary@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
