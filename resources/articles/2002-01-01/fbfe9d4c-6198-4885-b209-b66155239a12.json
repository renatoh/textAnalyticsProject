Seven horses set off in the 1.40 race over an extended three miles, with Family Business the hot favourite at 8-11. Countless tickets must have hit betting shop floors at around 1.43, when Family Business unseated the champion at the 10th fence and galloped off riderless in the general direction of the town centre. Then punters were treated to an astonishing sequence of events. Two runners had already departed by the time Family Business tried to do the same, leaving four horses still racing for the \u00a33,100 prize. But not for long. Eaux Les Coeurs and Joe Luke went at the 12th, leaving What A Wonder well clear of Red Radish. Until the 13th, anyway, when What A Wonder unseated his jockey. Red Radish, a 66-1 chance, raced on alone to the fourth last, where he refused. For a few moments, all was still. Then What A Wonder and Eaux Les Coeurs reappeared, having been remounted. Both made it to the fourth last, where What A Wonder unseated his jockey and Eaux Les Coeurs refused. Enter McCoy on the favourite. Family Business had been caught by Bob Hodge, his trainer Martin Pipe's travelling head lad, and as he heard the drama unfolding over the course commentary the jockey decided to remount. He eventually finished alone, five minutes outside the standard time. The result was a disaster for one punter on betfair.com, an internet betting exchange, who laid \u00a34 at 1000-1 against Family Business after McCoy fell off. He probably thought he was being clever. It turned out to be the worst bet of his life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
