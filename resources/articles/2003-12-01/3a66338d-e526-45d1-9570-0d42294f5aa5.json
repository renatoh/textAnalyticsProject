The Arsenal manager will be intrigued to see how Claudio Ranieri's expensively assembled squad react to the latter stages of the championship campaign in the spring. Arsenal remain unbeaten as they prepare for their Boxing Day fixture at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers, a Premiership record run, and Wenger is sure his side will only get stronger. \"Chelsea and [Manchester] United buying so many players pushed us as well,\" said Wenger. \"It has certainly bonded us and the hunger from not winning the title last year is still there. We have a good team dynamic, our players know each other well and we are mentally strong. \"The decisive period is in March or April and we have experience of the pressure of that time. United as well, but Chelsea, they don't. They have that experience as a group of players but not as a team. \"Alex Ferguson says his team get stronger in the second half of the season but you could say the same of Arsenal. In 1998 we were 11 points behind United in January and we went on to win the Double.\" Wenger also fears that United will draw sustenance from the Rio Ferdinand affair. \"In a big club, the players have to be mentally strong. Adversity sometimes makes them stronger,\" he said. \"It can give them a different target and make them stronger, but you still can't get any more than three points for a win.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
