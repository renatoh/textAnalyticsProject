Trials are set; justice is pending. In other words, the book\u2019s fictional world is our current one. The duo narrating the story are friends of 20 years \u2013 Quinlan Maximillian Saunders (known as Q), and Margot (M). Both are influential book editors in the US. The relationship has been one of affection, ambivalence, trust, humour and accommodation. In both narratives the tone is confessional; they are going on record, perhaps with a scrutinising world, and, more intimately, with the reader. Q must address his past behaviour. M is examining her friendship with him. They have never been lovers; the boundaries made clear since M unequivocally stopped Q grabbing her between the legs at their first lunch meeting. She has frequently upbraided him for, as well as been entertained by, his outlandish behaviour. Q is an Englishman, a dandy dresser married to a beautiful, wealthy heiress, and he likes nothing more than working his way into the confidences and vulnerabilities of women, from which he creates ambiguous relationships. \u201cAs if I were a magician, she listened to me tell her about herself: what she was like, what she needed, what she needed to correct.\u201d He\u2019s generous, attentive, and a provocateur. He believes women act out, and out of, their own truths; that experiences of the world and our stories essentially construct the world. He is accused of assaults on women in his employment and the wider community. Certainly, he understands that the world is changing; believes that \u201cwomen are now very into the victim story\u201d, and in his unguarded comments to M reveals a solipsistic analysis of the situation and a transferred brand of blame: \u201cThey are angry at what\u2019s happening in the country and in the government. They can\u2019t strike at the king, so they go for the jester.\u201d He\u2019s professionally punished. His family is deeply damaged. He feels spiritually cuffed, but maintains an ego-soothing optimism that his case will be dismissed. And atonement? Is he sorry? Does he comprehend the nature and effect of his crimes? There\u2019s room to feel sympathy with the flamboyant, roguish Q, and some readers will; it\u2019s an astonishingly humane characterisation, articulated within mutable social dynamics. But more urgently, we are primed to penetrate Q\u2019s defences and misogyny, primed for penitence. Here, Gaitskill nails one of the most disempowering and frustrating aspects of the recent sexual offences shakedown: the frequently unrewarded desire for enlightenment and apology, and genuine reformation of perpetrators. M, however, is very quick to apologise; \u201cI\u2019m sorry to report \u2026\u201d she states early in the discourse. There\u2019s much contrition and soul searching over her relationship with Q, her concomitant complicity with his attitudes. She endures scornful opinions about \u201cwomen trying to defend these creeps. The ones who say, \u2018That\u2019s just what men are like.\u2019\u201d Others whisper covert admiration at her loyalty. Some of Q\u2019s accusers express regret and M is furious with them; that they benefited from Q\u2019s patronage before indicting him. She recognises a mutuality of arrangements between him and his carousel of ladies. There\u2019s much sex talk in the book, but few sexual acts. Q is never \u201cunfaithful\u201d to his wife, who slaps him publicly but stays with him, and she\u2019s angrier about the fact that he\u2019s an \u201cidiot\u201d rather than a straightforward \u201cpredator\u201d. M is also upset by Q\u2019s response. He doesn\u2019t gaslight victims by telling them their reaction to his bad behaviour is crazy; instead he laments their loss as friends. M considers Q a better friend than many of her female acquaintances. But should she forgive him if he cannot metabolise his guilt? Perhaps the real question the author poses through Margot\u2019s reflectiveness is, why are women often better than men at examining their responsibilities and complicity, and at holding themselves to account? There are no easy answers or safe moral stations within the book. The two narratives converse, diverge, agree and disagree, brilliantly covering this hotly debated terrain. In fewer than 100 pages, Gaitskill achieves a superb feat. She distils the suffering, anger, reactivity, danger and social recalibration of the #MeToo movement into an extremely potent, intelligent and nuanced account. She pares a single story from the chorus of condemnations, with their similarities, varieties, truths and perceptions, and through select incidents and emotional focus we see the complex details of the wider picture. It takes an expert in short fiction to condense such a difficult subject, while allowing the reader interpretive space. Gaitskill is phenomenally gifted at the metaphysical microcosmic. She makes the abstruse world clearer. There are many ways the topic will be tackled in literature. This Is Pleasure sensitively and confidently holds its fury, momentum, contrary forces and imperfect humanity within a perfect frame. \u2022 Sarah Hall\u2019s Sudden Traveller is published this week by Faber.
