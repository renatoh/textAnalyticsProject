The manager has returned to Porto, where he established his reputation by winning the Uefa and European Cups a little over a decade ago, for Tuesday\u2019s Champions League group game and will face a team with Iker Casillas, his former goalkeeper at Real Madrid, at the Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o. The pair\u2019s relationship had fractured badly during Mourinho\u2019s three-year spell at the Bernab\u00e9u and there has been no contact since the coach left Spain in 2013. Yet, while that confrontation has drawn the focus in Portugal, the manager is more preoccupied with restoring his current side\u2019s qualities and has threatened to drop those underperforming senior players and \u201cgo with the kids\u201d if the team\u2019s form rules them out of challenging for honours. Mourinho was disgusted with the first-half display at Newcastle on Saturday, pinpointing six of his players as having put in \u201cvery bad performances\u201d. \u201cSince half-time [at St James\u2019 Park], they know who they are,\u201d said the manager. \u201cThe matches where we performed with a consistent attitude were the matches we won, so we need to learn how to be consistent again. Physically there\u2019s no problem. Tactically it\u2019s the same. Clearly it\u2019s an attitude perspective of some individuals. And when you have individuals with that unstable attitude in terms of motivation, desire and commitment, you will pay. \u201cThere are two sorts of champions. There are those who win something, and there are lots of them. But there are the other champions who, during their career, win one, two, three, four, five, 10 or 20 titles. In this club we have 25 champions from last year, but serial champions in this squad? John Terry, Jon Mikel [Obi] and [Branislav] Ivanovic are serial champions. Almost every season they have something in the pocket. But how many other serial champions do we have? \u201cLast year we were champions, but the point for me is are we serial champions? Of course it\u2019s very difficult to win every season, but you can be a serial champion in your approach and your attitude. If we fight every minute of every game and in the end someone has two more points, then we don\u2019t go from champions to losers. Not at all. If you lose the Champions League final to Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain or Bayern Munich you are not a loser. Mentally I can say I am a serial champion. I can be five or 10 years without winning a title, but I will still be a serial champion in my approach and my attitude. This is the problem we have at this moment. We have champions, but not serial champions. \u201cNobody understood it but when the Arsenal fans were singing against Chelsea last week and I was tapping my arm, I was saying: \u2018Look at the shirts.\u2019 We have the [golden] Premier League badge on our shirts because we\u2019re champions. But one thing is to be champion once and another is the mentality. I don\u2019t demand that they\u2019re champions every season. In England that\u2019s impossible, especially at Chelsea because when we win the title it\u2019s the end of the world and nobody [outside the club] is happy. But you can be a serial champion in your attitude. And for me that\u2019s the point.\u201d Mourinho will restore Diego Costa \u2013 who is in the middle of a three-match domestic ban for his clash with Laurent Koscielny in the victory over Arsenal earlier this month \u2013 to his starting lineup at the Drag\u00e3o, with the Spain international having taken his suspension poorly. \u201cLike everyone here, he is not happy,\u201d said the manager. John Terry is also expected to be recalled having missed the 2-2 draw on Tyneside. This will be Mourinho\u2019s third return to Porto with Chelsea though his first visit to the city in eight years, with the Portuguese insisting he will \u201cswitch off\u201d his emotions during the game. There would be \u201cno problem\u201d if he comes face to face with Casillas, who will be making a record 152nd appearance in the competition. Regardless, the Chelsea manager is expecting an immediate reaction from his team \u2013 who won their opening Group G match comfortably against Maccabi Tel Aviv \u2013 in the wake of Saturday\u2019s toils. \u201cThey fight and want to improve, but we have some players I want more from,\u201d he added. \u201cI look for consistency. If we don\u2019t find it, we become a Newcastle. Everyone knows when Newcastle play Chelsea they play amazingly well but against other teams, not so well. This happens with most of the teams whose objective is to stay between eighth and 16th in the league. \u201cThey win today, draw tomorrow, three points here, one point there. But when you want to be a big team and to win you have to be consistent in your attitude. At this moment it\u2019s difficult to win the Premier League, but possible. It\u2019s difficult to win the Champions League, but possible. It\u2019s difficult to win the cups, but possible. I\u2019ve explained to the players that when the situation is open, I have to try and prepare the kids for their future and, at the same time, bring the best out of the players with more experience. \u201cBut if the season becomes \u2018closed\u2019 and we can\u2019t win trophies, I will go just with the kids instead. It makes no sense to play the older players when you have nothing to win. There can be a moment where I will look to the kids and say: \u2018Let\u2019s go, non-stop.\u2019 I am ruthless. But at the moment, everything is open.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
