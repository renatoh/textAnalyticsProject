To judge by the no-nonsense way Curtis Strange responded when asked how he is handling the Tiger Woods question, the US captain will be taking his cue from Leo Durocher and Vince Lombardi. \"It's been handled,\" Strange said. In Ireland last week, Woods made no secret of his dislike of the way his usual preparation routines are disrupted by the need to attend three formal dinners during the week and to spend two days practising under the captain's supervision. At the captains' joint press conference here yesterday Strange was asked whether the world's No1 player would be given special treatment. \"We had dinner together last night and we discussed some of those things,\" Strange said. \"Nothing changes. We play at 8.30 or nine o'clock or thereabouts on Tuesday and Wednesday, the 12 of them will go off the 1st tee together and we will act as we always act. \"This whole week takes you out of your normal routine - not just Tiger Woods, any player. Because you do have things that are part of this week that some people enjoy, it's a different week, it really is. But that's why everyone does enjoy it. It's a team atmosphere. Yes, there are social functions we have to attend, which is fine. When you come here, you're gonna be part of a team.\" Europe's captain had the fastest response to a mention of Woods's now famous claim that there were \"a million reasons\" why he would rather win last weekend's million-dollar first prize at Mount Juliet than the Ryder Cup. \"I think we'd probably chip in and pay a million to win this week,\" Torrance said. Strange, however, alleged that most of the US players would have echoed Woods's opinion. \"To me it was an unfair question,\" he said, \"because they're different animals - strokeplay and an individual tournament, match-play and a team event. And, when you try to answer it honestly, you get in trouble. I think we know that, when Tiger Woods plays, he's ready to play. He's the least of my concerns.\" Neither captain was giving away information on likely pairings, but there were hints of minor differences in their strategies when they were asked whether all their players would be given a game in the foursomes and four-balls before the final round of singles matches, bearing in mind that three years ago Europe suffered on the Sunday when Andrew Coltart, Jarmo Sandelin and Jean Van de Velde were belatedly thrust into action after sitting on the sidelines for two days. \"Everybody comes to the Ryder Cup to play,\" Strange said, \"and I want everybody in my team to play at least one match before the singles.\" \"I think it would help if everybody has played,\" Torrance agreed, \"but it's not guaranteed. If somebody isn't playing well, I'm not giving away points so that they can have a free game.\" Early arrivals at the Belfry were welcomed by police guards carrying automatic weapons, a foretaste of the security cordon that will protect the players as they compete in an event postponed in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Although some members of the US team have spoken of their plans to get on the first flight home in the event of the outbreak of a war with Iraq, Strange said his players have no worries about their safety at the course. \"We've been used to this for years and years. This is not anything unusual when you go to some other places around the world. So I think we feel quite comfortable and safe.\" Both captains expressed a belief that there would be no repeat of the overexuberance seen at Brookline three years ago. \"You probably can't get a more tension-filled environment than the Ryder Cup,\" Torrance said. \"It's the toughest format in golf and probably the most loved. But every six or seven years, one or the other side just bubbles over. You realise you've done something wrong and you start again. \"As for the spectators, we just ask them to be fair. Support as loud as you want but never when someone is swinging or just before they're swinging - just the true etiquette of the game, which we all know and understand.\" Strange pointed out that the tournament has always aroused passions. \"We're going to see a great match and a hard-fought match,\" he said. \"It's always been hard-fought, patriotic, loud and boisterous, even way back. If people didn't get excited and root for their own team, it wouldn't be as much fun.\" \"It wouldn't be the Ryder Cup,\" Torrance concluded.
