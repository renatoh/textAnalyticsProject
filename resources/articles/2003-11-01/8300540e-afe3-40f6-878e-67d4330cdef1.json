Today's main event was a mock state procession, in which peace campaigners dressed as the US president and the Queen led a parade including a pink \"love tank\" and fancy dress weapons inspectors and Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees. When the procession reached Trafalgar Square, organiser Ghad Ruzuki addressed the crowd through a megaphone, urging people to attend tomorrow's main demonstration in central London. The demonstration is expected to attract more than 100,000 people, and Ms Ruzuki said: \"When George Bush is behind closed doors, the streets of London will be ours.\" George Galloway, the MP recently expelled from the Labour Party, echoed her sentiments. \"Today's demonstration is just an hors d'oeuvres,\" Mr Galloway said. \"Tomorrow is the main course, and I think you all will be sated and filled by the main course that will be delivered up by the huge demonstration that is going to occur around here tomorrow.\" As many as 1,000 protesters took part in the procession, which ran from Jubilee Gardens on the South Bank to Trafalgar Square, according to Scotland Yard. Scotland Yard said that there had been 18 arrests for minor offences thought to include offensive language on a placard. Deputy assistant commissioner Andy Trotter said that, despite the arrests, \"this morning's events went off extremely well\". There were, however, signs of increasing tension later in the day, as protesters outside Buckingham Palace clashed with a group of pro-Bush demonstrators. One group of protesters set up a sound system close to Buckingham Palace, playing rap music with the lyrics \"He's the son of a bad man.\" Two rows of police officers stopped another group from passing through Birdcage Walk to the main section of protesters, who stood chanting and waving placards. More than 10 police vans helped block off the road towards the main palace precinct. At 4.50pm, police began jumping over crowd barriers near the palace. Scores of officers ran into the crowd, holding batons, and appeared to divide the protesters in two. Objects were seen flying through the air, although it is not known what they were. Soil was also thrown towards the police. At least one protester was seen lying on the road, surrounded by police. It was unclear whether he or she had been hurt or was simply being restrained. Another was hauled from the crowd and escorted away by police, while one officer was seen sitting on the road with what appeared to be eggshells around him. A heavy police presence was keeping the majority of demonstrators penned in on the pavement opposite the palace, and a few minor scuffles could be seen breaking out. A crowd of protesters dressed as clowns positioned themselves by a stronghold of President Bush supporters. Most wore green wigs with colanders on their heads, waving flags which read \"justice, decency, mirth\". As they made their protest, the pro-Bush contingent sang the US national anthem. Nearby, a row broke out between some rival protesters. More and more people became embroiled in the heated debate, which ended up in an exchange of insults. One President Bush supporter said: \"Go home, have a bath and wash your hair.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
