Hillary Clinton's sizeable victory in Ohio and narrow margin in Texas could be the headline. They don't exactly make her a redux version of the Comeback Kid, but they do allow her to claim that she's still a viable candidate. She'll argue that momentum's on her side and that her focus on national security and experience is finally paying dividends. As I said, it's a plausible headline ... except that Barack Obama's vote tally in Texas means he comes out of the March 4 primaries about as far ahead in the delegate count as he was going in. (According to the Associated Press, Clinton gained a net of only 12 delegates yesterday, leaving Obama more than 100 delegates ahead still.) So I'll leave the headlines to others and instead just note down some thoughts. Exactly 75 years before yesterday's primaries, on March 4, 1933 Franklin Delano Roosevelt was sworn in as president, coming off of an election in which he'd carried all-but-six states. These days, his inaugural speech is best known for the line: \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\" It's a great sound bite, but it doesn't really do justice to the scope of FDR's vision that day. That long-ago March 4, Roosevelt recognised the depth of the country's financial crisis; launched a stinging attack on the unsound, predatory lending practices banks had used to prey on homeowners and farmers; called for the government to restore confidence in the financial system through asserting aggressive regulatory powers; declared he was willing to use broad executive authority to tackle a crisis he likened to that of a nation at war; and stated his willingness to put the unemployed to work building up America's infrastructure. Obama has no trouble matching FDR's sound bites. But then there's the hard part, the stuff further down the speech that doesn't trip off students' lips generations later but that actually matters more: backing up the sound bites with commitments, notable for their specifics rather than mantra-like tones, to shore up a nation in distress. And then, once in office, acting on those commitments. Personally, I think Obama's far more than just brilliant rhetoric. But Clinton's charge that her opponent doesn't have the mettle to create his own version of the New Deal or the Great Society seems to have at least temporarily stalled the Obama-march. Her come-out-swinging tactics worked in Ohio. Whether or not they worked in Texas too - a state she was ahead in by 20% not too long ago, and which she won by less than four percentage points come election day - will be the subject of massive spin efforts over the coming days and weeks. To my non-American readers, a brief reminder of Texas' scale. It has a population of 23 million, spread out over 268,601 square miles - the size of France, Austria and the Low Countries combined. Moreover, it's not really one distinct political entity. Because of its location right in the heart of America, and the ways in which different ethnic groupings are spread out, it's partly a deep south state, its eastern fringes culturally akin to, say, Arkansas or Louisiana. Its northern region is tied agriculturally to the prairie states of the Midwest. Partly it's a western state, the place where the American landscape opens up and the rangelands and desert grab your soul as you drive west into the sun. And, to complicate matters, it has a vast border region with Mexico, throughout which a distinct Tex-Mex culture has evolved over the past 150-plus years. The Texas that George Bush embodies, the Texas of oil money and religious extremism, the Texas hostile to organised labour and built upon the pseudo-nationalist mythology of the Battle of the Alamo, is but one of several visions of the Lone Star state. There's also the radical hill country Texas out of which Lyndon Johnson emerged. There's the populist Texas that helped elect firebrand Democratic governor Ann Richardson back in the 1990s and produced the outlaw country music of Willie Nelson. There's the liberal Texas represented by Austin, the wacky, almost San Francisco-like, state capital. And there's the Texas of impoverished border colonias where Spanish language and Mexican culture dominates. Those are the many versions of Texas that the primary contenders have been trying to knit together into electoral majorities over the last many weeks. Exactly how many Texas delegates Clinton and Obama will each reap won't be known for days, though we can reach some pretty good estimates today. The state has an almost impossibly complex system of delegate allocation, part primary, part caucus, part based on the numbers of party voters who turned out in the 2006 elections in each congressional district. One could write a book on the party election process in Texas (though few would read it). So, for now, let's just accept that it's pretty much incomprehensible and move on to the results themselves. A few weeks back, Bill Clinton said that his wife had to win both Ohio and Texas to take the nomination. That sort of happened yesterday, and it sort of didn't. At least partially, this one's in the eye of the beholder. Clinton won the primary vote by a whisker (a few tens of thousands out of over three million votes), lost the follow-up caucus and ended up leaving the Lone Star state with slightly fewer delegates than her opponent. Spun one way, she won both Ohio and Texas and met Bill's put-up-or-quit challenge. Spun another way, Obama and Clinton split the difference in Texas, leaving Obama secure in his frontrunner status. Doing the math, it's hard to see how Clinton can springboard these results to emerge as the nominee-presumptive going into the Denver convention. It'll be hard for her to end up with more pledged delegates than Obama, and it will be near-impossible for her to secure an outright majority of delegates. But she can now prevent Obama from claiming a clear majority. She can also make an argument that Ohio shows she has blue-collar pull, while the breakdown of the Texas vote demonstrates that she performs extremely well with Latinos - an important plus given that that demographic grouping is widely viewed as a must-win toss-up constituency: about 40% of Latino voters cast their ballots for Bush in 2004, and while many GOP politicians alienated Latinos in recent years with their anti-immigration rhetoric, McCain's proven himself a moderate on immigration and is pretty popular with this group of voters. If Clinton can make the case that she can peel off Latinos from the GOP constituency in a way that Obama can't, her appeal to senior party figures increases going into the convention. So the race will go on. To Mississippi and Wyoming next week. To Pennsylvania in April and beyond. Perhaps to the party gathering in Denver. I still doubt it will be a genuine brokered convention, but the odds have shifted somewhat toward this messy-but-exciting occurrence with yesterday's inconclusive outcome in Texas.
