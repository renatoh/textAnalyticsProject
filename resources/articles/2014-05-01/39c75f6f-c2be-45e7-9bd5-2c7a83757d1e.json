They were defeated by nine runs in front of a packed house by Sri Lanka, the T20 world champions. There is no disgrace in that and this is just the first of countless games against Asian opposition this summer. However, there will be an unwanted tension in the England camp until they conjure some victories, given their appalling winter. England\u2019s victory target of 184 was larger than it should have been. Eoin Morgan, the captain, was satisfied with the first 15 overs in the field but, using Irish understatement, he acknowledged: that \u201cWe didn\u2019t finish as well as we would like.\u201d As ever a dropped catch triggered England\u2019s loss of control. Michael Carberry, a surprising pick as a debutant in this form of the game at 33 years of age, dropped a straightforward skier offered by Thisara Perera and thereafter the floodgates opened. \u201cIt was the turning point of their innings,\u201d said Morgan. Perera finished with 49 from 20 balls and devastated Chris Jordan\u2019s final over, which yielded 22 runs. Alex Hales, as was the case in Chittagong when these two sides last met, was the main threat to the Sri Lankans. He hit 66 but, as Morgan ruefully admitted, \u201cThe batting stuttered around him and unfortunately he struggled to keep the strike.\u201d Lasith Malinga, Sri Lanka\u2019s captain, bowled superbly once again. The other England debutant, Harry Gurney, the left-arm paceman from Nottinghamshire, had a happier time than Carberry. He took two for 26 from his four overs and managed to look comfortable in this company. \u201cHe did magnificently well, taking his county form into international cricket,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cSo it\u2019s not all bleak.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
