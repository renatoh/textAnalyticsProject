Gordon Taylor is not the chief exec of the PFA for nothing. Oh no, he gets \u00a3400,000 a year (boom, boom!). But there's no denying he's good at his job of standing by his players no matter what. Which is more than can normally be said of Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier. But today the two men joined each other on the karaoke stage to sing a song of support for gambling addict and England Vice captain Michael Owen. \"Everybody needs a release and this would appear to be his,\" crooned Taylor to schoolboy sniggers everywhere, before people realised he was talking about horses. \"I'm glad he likes horses because you need to have a passion,\" chorused Houllier, his washing-machine drum eyes whirring onto the start of their spin cycle. Yes, it seems Lil' Mickey is finding out one of life's hardest lessons: you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it win a race. However, reports of his bets have, according to Houllier at least, been greatly exaggerated. It's more like \u00a340,000 over two years than \u00a32.2m apparently - which amounts to four days' wages, not counting commercial endorsements. \"There has been plenty of exaggeration but then people always exaggerate, certainly the media,\" continued Houllier's solo before taking it to the bridge with a needless dig at his hapless keeper. \"I read recently that we signed Jerzy Dudek for \u00a370,000 a week! That says it all!\" But will the media wreck Owen's career? Don't bet on it. \"He's like me, he took it as a laugh,\" laughed Houllier. \"I repeated to him, 'Don't let them destroy you because you're stronger than that and you're bigger than that,'\" he warbled as Taylor tried to wrestle the mic off him. But just then, Owen's management company SFX burst in, turned off the karaoke machine and announced: \"It was not long ago that Michael's family of seven lived together in a tiny house in a north Wales village. He has helped to raise hundreds of thousands for charities over the past few years, and he is totally devoted to his family.\" And to think, football's most colourless 'character' almost had an edge. PARANOID ANDROID You don't have to be paranoid to be Arsenal's dashing Dutchman Dennis Bergkamp, but it certainly helps. It's less than a calendar month since The Man - AKA The FA - decided to bring Den down a peg or two by investigating his leisurely stroll across Nils-Eric Johansson's chest. ITV captured it on video, replaying it on prime-time Saturday night in super slo-mo for the bloodthirsty, boozed up masses. To steal a Big Ron-ism, it appeared a stick-on GBH charge. But according to Dirty Den there was \"no case to answer. There was really nothing wrong.\" The FA weren't buying into the conspiracy theory, though, so charged him with violent conduct, fined him \u00a35,000 and warned him, with a wagging pinky, to watch his future conduct. Judging by yesterday's tetchy tussle with the hapless Hammers at Highbury, though, it seems that Den wasn't listening. For despite cheering the nation with a swift elbow to lil' Lee Bowyer's larrikin-esque features, Den has yet again found himself under investigation by those oppressive cats at the FA. \"We can confirm the FA has requested a copy of the video of an incident between Dennis Bergkamp and Lee Bowyer,\" be-bopped the FA's jazzy website, thefa.com, this afternoon. \"As is always the case, the FA will await the officials' match reports before considering what, if any, action is to be taken.\" Mirroring his style of play, Den chose to get his retaliation in first. \"It was an accident. I was protecting the ball,\" he pleaded, shaking his pointed snout at the unjust nature of it all. \"The only time I knew he was there was when I turned and there was contact with him,\" he sighed. \"I felt sorry for him but there was nothing else I could have done.\" Even Arsene Wenger could see the injustice. \"It looked to me like he was protecting the ball and Bowyer ran into him,\" he shrugged. And given that Arsene frequently fails to see past the end of his own nose, that's saying something. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"He's a positive power now. And there's a psychological value... you can imagine when the players of an opposition team go out knowing that Darth Vader is watching them\" - Exeter City chairman and all-round nut job Uri Geller welcomes David Prowse, the actor who played the wheezing Star Wars villain, to his position as honorary chairman of the club alongside Michael Jackson and David Blaine. CLOUGH ON THE MEND AFTER LIVER OP Brian Clough had just two months to live before he underwent a successful liver transplant, his surgeon revealed today. The transplant team also found cancer in his diseased liver when they performed the major operation last week at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital. \"He is very lucky,\" consultant Derek Manas told a news conference. \"He had weeks or months to live. I would have been worried if we had waited another two months.\" But Mr Manas said the growth had been removed and that Clough was making a good recovery. \"He is recovering very well, in fact things are going so well he could well be going home in a week.\" Clough, who is being treated as an NHS patient, was in good spirits, the surgeon said, adding: \"He is being his old self, teaching us all how to play golf and telling us what, and what not, to do.\" Nigel Clough, manager of Conference club Burton Albion, said his father was \"doing OK\" and asked for the family's privacy to be respected. Clough, who has had a long battle to beat the bottle, led Nottingham Forest to two European Cup triumphs during his career as a manager, which also saw him win the old First Division title with Derby. THE RUMOUR MILL Manchester United and Newcastle are in the hunt for Southampton's highlighted highlight James Beattie. Figures of \u00a312m have been mentioned.
