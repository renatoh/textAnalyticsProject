The son of Bosnian partisans who was born in 1948 and died on Monday aged 71, he scored the late goal that rescued Luton from relegation in May 1983, just as he had taken them up the summer before. \u201cAn amazing act of escapology,\u201d the commentator called it, and that shot from the edge of the area by a substitute who had been on for 10 minutes sent his manager skipping and leaping and bounding across the Manchester City pitch like a kangaroo in a beige suit. Antic enjoyed replaying it for those who hadn\u2019t seen it \u2013 and in Spain, where he managed for 16 years, the place he made his home, mostly they hadn\u2019t. As a player, he had won the league in Turkey and the former Yugoslavia, and played at Zaragoza, but he kept returning to Maine Road. When Javier C\u00e1ceres, from S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, asked him for his most important, most fondly remembered goal, Antic recalled a header for Fenerbahce scored with a fractured skull but took the pen and started sketching his Luton teammate Brian Stein instead. Antic learned a lot at Luton, he liked to say. A lot from Pleat too, the manager saying never to ignore the crowd, the culture: it was the people who mattered. While he didn\u2019t follow at first, not least because it deprived him of the chance to play as a libero, Antic came to agree. A born talker, conversation usually took him to England fast and to football even faster. There was nothing he liked more, he said, and it showed. A weekend when he didn\u2019t watch 20 games was a weekend wasted, he reckoned. He died when there was none. When he became a coach at Zaragoza four years after leaving Luton, there was much that Antic brought from England, but it went back further. \u201cIn Yugoslavia sport was always a symbol of personality, identity,\u201d he said, opening one of those long discussions in his Aravaca home with that Balkans accent so recognisably his, the article absent from every sentence. Soon he was saying: \u201cThe way you play has to fit the culture of the people you represent; you have to get into the heart of them.\u201d Storytelling inevitably took him downstairs, where you couldn\u2019t see the wall for photographs, cuttings and memorabilia and couldn\u2019t leave without a bottle of wine. The way he told it, the day Real Madrid approached him, at a restaurant called Jockey where the president Ram\u00f3n Mendoza liked to hold court, he was warned: \u201cAt this table, no one rejects my offers.\u201d Antic replied: \u201cYou\u2019ve never had a Serbian sitting in front of you.\u201d In truth, they had wanted him to be sporting director, but he was determined to coach instead and he did, still only 43. His upbringing had been austere but proud and he identified as a socialist. He played chess, basketball, table tennis and he boxed, but it was football he did best. The first time his name appeared in the paper, he brought it home. \u201cYou\u2019ve come a long way: now everyone can wipe their arse with you,\u201d his mother said, or so the story goes. He would be in other match reports too, many of which he kept. A lifetime in football eventually led him to manage Serbia, a photo of his grandchildren in their kits carried with him, and work at eight clubs in five countries. It was not all good. As a manager he won only two trophies, although they arrived in one unforgettable year, and he was relegated twice in a row. Famously, he was sacked 19 games into the season with Madrid seven points clear at the top. Mendoza claimed they weren\u2019t exciting enough, but Antic saw politics at play. \u201cI was young, I thought people were more honourable,\u201d he said. Without him, Madrid blew the league. At Barcelona, he arrived to steady a club in crisis in 2003 but elections followed and he was soon gone. \u201cI was there for six months; it was like six years,\u201d he said. And between them was Atl\u00e9tico Madrid \u2013 he is the only manager ever to have coached all three of La Liga\u2019s biggest clubs. \u201cI chose Atl\u00e9tico because it was the hardest club in the world and I wanted to prove myself,\u201d he claimed. \u201cMy success there was precisely that they were arrogant,\u201d he said; it was a quality he saw as his and theirs. \u201cAtl\u00e9tico represents people who struggle to get to the end of the month but who won\u2019t admit they\u2019re inferior to anyone. So that\u2019s what we did: we went out for more and more, we were the rebellion of the humble.\u201d Antic had wanted to take Michael Robinson as his assistant. He didn\u2019t get that wish; he did get his wish to sign Milinko Pantic, but only after he promised the president, Jes\u00fas Gil, he would pay half himself if it failed, which it didn\u2019t: even now flowers are laid by the corner before every game in honour of the deliveries that did so much to take them to the title. Atl\u00e9tico had gone 19 years without winning the league; in 1996, under him, they claimed their only double. Pantic called Antic a father on Monday and many felt the same way, especially at Atl\u00e9tico. It is impossible to do justice to how big that season was or how unexpected. In the eight years before Antic arrived, Atl\u00e9tico had changed coach 30 times. He alone lasted three years, a desperately unlucky Champions League exit in 1997 hard to take before eventually departing in 1998. He would be back for two more brief spells, in 1999 and 2000, his CV reading Atl\u00e9tico, Atl\u00e9tico, Atl\u00e9tico, but those failures were forgotten fast beneath the joy of 96. Nothing was ever the same and would ever compare to that. Luton apart, how could it? \u201cI\u2019m crying on the inside,\u201d Antic said when he departed for the first time. Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s old home \u2013 his home \u2013 stands in ruins, its demolition almost complete, while football stadiums everywhere stand silent, but that day in May 1998 the Calder\u00f3n was noisy and packed, ready to say goodbye. \u201cI fought to make these people happy and seeing them like this makes it all worthwhile,\u201d he said. As he walked away, they sang: \u201cRadomir, I love you.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
