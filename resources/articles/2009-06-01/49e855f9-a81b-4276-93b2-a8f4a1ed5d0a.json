City hope to follow their signing of Aston Villa's Gareth Barry by adding his England team-mate to their squad and will offer Everton around \u00a315m, a move the FA Cup finalists will resist. Their manager, David Moyes, has publicly stated that none of his players are for sale, especially his centre-backs, given Phil Jagielka's potential absence until Christmas as he recovers from a knee injury, yet much will depend on Lescott's attitude. The defender is contracted to Everton until 2012 but, when asked whether a switch to City would interest him, he opted against reaffirming his commitment to Goodison and instead replied: \"That's not a question I want to be answering. Nobody has told me otherwise, so I'm an Everton player.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
