A self-described queer femme goddess and disabled domme, Buckthorne sells photos and videos of herself wearing strappy lingerie and spiky jewelry and casts virtual \u201cwitch domme spells\u201d on her willing fans. \u201cBut quickly I realized not only could I be open about my gender and sexuality, but it would attract more interesting, better matched customers. With OnlyFans, I can be exactly as queer, femme, eccentric and unabashed as I want,\u201d says Buckhorne, whose offerings range from sex education and relationship advice to financial domination. Free porn sites and live-streaming platforms don\u2019t typically have search categories for non-binary genders, which can be limiting to performers\u2019 creativity and self-expression. On sitessuch as PornHub, performers who upload their own content often have to choose between just two gender categories, or a third trans category sometimes identified by a pejorative term. OnlyFans, however, lets creators self-identify and cultivate a viewership on their own terms. Non-white and gender non-conforming performers with loyal followers through their social media accounts can entice their followers to also engage with them on an adult platform and pay for a more intimate look at their lives (and bodies). \u201cWe are not a marketplace and therefore every creator has the opportunity to self-identify as they wish and build a space that\u2019s focused on their content for their fans,\u201d founder Tim Stokely told me. The Pittsburgh-based adult performer Luna Luz, who identifies as \u201ca BBW Latina\u201d, or big, beautiful woman, launched her OnlyFans page a few months ago to supplement her income from phone sex services and other sex work. She says the platform helps facilitate cross-promotion. \u201cI think that within queer, non-binary, trans, black and POC communities there is a really cool culture of promoting each other, which can pull in more people that are used to surfing the mainstream porn platforms,\u201d said Luz. \u201cPeople lift each other up by retweeting new models, giving shoutouts and creating content together to sell on our clips sites or to post on OnlyFans.\u201d At just $5 per month for a subscription to her page, Luz can make her content accessible to more of her fans. For newer, less experienced content creators hoping to build a following on OnlyFans, lower prices allow for more potential subscribers and more exposure. Others, like the adult industry veteran Jessica Drake, charge up to $20 for a monthly subscription. \u201cOne of the biggest benefits to platforms like OnlyFans is that I think it\u2019s definitely taken some of the power away from porn companies\u2019 hands and placed all the control with the performer,\u201d Drake, who looks much like the epitome of \u201cporn star\u201d, told me. Drake got her start the way many adult performers did two decades ago \u2013 as a stripper. She danced at a club in El Paso, Texas, that regularly booked featured dancers for themed shows and competitions that attracted porn industry professionals. There, Drake hit it off with an in-demand adult film director and his crew. \u201cThat is very much how people got into the industry, was by being recruited by people in person,\u201d Drake told me over coffee at a Starbucks in Granada Hills, California. Eventually, they brought her to an adult film set in LA. \u201cI was the condom and lube girl,\u201d Drake said. \u201cI literally was standing there with a box of baby wipes, a bowl of condoms. There were some bottles of lube, paper towels, bottled water.\u201d It wasn\u2019t glamorous work, but Drake loved it. \u201cI stood next to one of the most popular performers at the time, Jill Kelly, and I just couldn\u2019t believe I was there,\u201d she said. \u201cI was feet away from someone that I had seen in movies, who I had masturbated to and had sex to. I really thought I was the luckiest girl in the world.\u201d Back when Drake got her start over 20 years ago, new porn actresses typically made their debut with a solo masturbation scene, then girl-on-girl, then boy-girl, before eventually ramping up to multiple scene partners. Drake jumped in with a boy-girl scene. The rise of a platform like OnlyFans turns that traditional ladder-climbing on its head by putting more power in the hands of performers who no longer need the approval of overwhelmingly white cis male industry scouts and gatekeepers to launch their careers. Greater representation of queer performers and performers of color isn\u2019t just good for audiences. In an industry where racism, fatphobia, and transphobia are common, the adult performer X\u00f6e Nova believes it\u2019s just as important for performers themselves to feel seen. \u201cI love showcasing raw and honest queer sexuality in all its forms. I truly enjoy the connections I have with the friends I perform with, and love showing the myriad of ways two (or more) people can have sex and express intimacy,\u201d said Nova, who uses \u201cthey\u201d or \u201che\u201d pronouns. Nova creates an intimate atmosphere with clear, natural lighting, and every scene is unique. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019m told often is that my work feels really fluid and real, like they just happened to be in the room to see me and my scene partner fuck. That\u2019s what I generally aim for.\u201d While he enjoys working with performers of all genders, Nova said scenes with trans partners were especially meaningful. \u201cIt\u2019s always extra special to work with other trans performers,\u201d Nova said. \u201cI personally find it magical to make porn with someone who is on the same path as me in that way, it\u2019s healing.\u201d After becoming a single parent about eight years ago, Nova started performing on the live-streaming site MyFreeCams. There, Nova said he felt creatively stifled by the lack of trans-affirming content and \u201ccookie cutter\u201d performances. \u201cFor a long time, I just didn\u2019t really see anybody that looks like me in porn, and I remember feeling that I\u2019m not a sexual being for myself. I felt like my image and my body are not for me, sex was not for me. This is something that\u2019s just for other people,\u201d said Nova. \u201cBeing able to see people who are my size and my color, my ethnic background in these things, it makes you feel like you and your desires are valid, and your image is valid.\u201d The Los Angeles-based performer Avery Jane St Germaine is queer and black. \u201cOnlyFans is like the Uberization of porn. Anyone can be their own porn star and collect their own fans. Anyone can make a living off of content creation,\u201d said St Germaine. Originally from Louisiana, St Germaine started her career in adult retail and later began sugar dating, or dating in exchange for financial support, and working as a cam model, stripper, escort and fetish performer. St Germaine started uploading videos to OnlyFans because it was easy \u2013 she didn\u2019t need special equipment and earned an 80% commission on subscription sales from the platform. \u201cA lot of marginalized folks don\u2019t have access to nice filming equipment, so a site where phone-quality videos and day-to-day life content is preferred is huge for us,\u201d said St Germaine. St Germaine points out that platforms for independent creators won\u2019t necessarily solve porn\u2019s industry-wide problems with racism, homophobia and transphobia. \u201cCisgender and white content creators will always be the default to support, and will rake in big bucks more often,\u201d she said. However, she believes OnlyFans is \u201ca saving grace\u201d for queer and trans performers of color, disabled performers, and non-traditional content creators. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the beginning of the future of adult content creation, in my opinion.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
