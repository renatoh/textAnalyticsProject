Not for decades has the Cheltenham Festival started on such a soggy surface as this time and it appears the old clich\u00e9 has, on this showing, no wisdom in it whatsoever as one well-backed winner follows another up the famous hill. \u201cIt\u2019s turned into a bloodbath,\u201d grimaces John Hughes, a bookmaker from Warrenpoint in Northern Ireland who has long held the treasured \u201cnumber one\u201d pitch in Cheltenham\u2019s boisterous betting ring. In that position, he is the first of dozens of bookies that punters come across and he has queues in front of him all afternoon. Punters hand over their stakes and then, 10 minutes later, they come back for their winnings. \u201cIt\u2019s the best betting I\u2019ve ever seen in Cheltenham. It was colossal. Unfortunately, it just turned out, our punters backed the winners.\u201d How much had John lost? \u201cI can\u2019t say. Oh God, the wife would leave me.\u201d All types of punters appear to be celebrating. At the sober, form-studying end of the spectrum there is Robert McCullough, who has been coming here from Maybole, Ayrshire for half a century and who tells of winning \u00a320,000 on Best Mate\u2019s third Gold Cup. He has drawn his horns in these days but says before the Champion Hurdle that Buveur D\u2019Air is the only possible play of the day. \u201cI probably bet too heavy for my means, if you understand,\u201d McCullough says. \u201cBut I think the game\u2019s more difficult now. It\u2019s difficult to get on. The bookies are keeping everything short.\u201d Where\u2019s the incentive to do anything else when even first-timers are finding the winners? Jubilant Dave, down from Middlesbrough, is on Summerville Boy because he was once a fan of Bronski Beat. He sticks the winnings on Mister Whitaker, having admired the horse\u2019s trainer, Mick Channon, when he was scoring goals for England. \u201cFantastic!\u201d is his verdict on the day, delivered as Elizabeth, his wife, returns from the ring clutching thick folds of \u00a320 notes. \u201cOverall, we\u2019ve done in about 12 grand,\u201d says Geoff Banks, climbing down from his pitch in the Centaur, which during the Festival is a sort of mosh pit of betting, drinking and cheering. Banks, familiar from many a gig on Channel 4 Racing, is usually as effervescent as bookmakers get but the afternoon has been taxing enough to turn him serious. \u201cOnce the punters get ahead in this game, they\u2019ve literally got you by the balls. We\u2019ve had a lot of each-way thieves winning and things like that. It\u2019s not as bad as a few years ago, when all of the Rich Ricci horses were winning. That was particularly bad. If you hear any sob stories from the big firms this time, it\u2019s just good PR. We\u2019ll all have lost but we\u2019re still going.\u201d \u201cYou can get such a run of money in here, it can be scary,\u201d says Andy Geraghty, taking bets behind the stands, by the See You Then bar. Geraghty is the last bookie in the area to be offering 9-5 about the first favourite, Getabird, and mainly Irish punters congregate in front of him to take the offer. He gets that one beaten but it is not enough. \u201cI wanted the second in the mares\u2019 race. That got me the absolute jackpot. And it went odds-on in running,\u201d he groans. Hughes gets a brief moment of encouragement in the next as Footpad plunges through an early fence just as the bookie is reeling off a long list of four-figure bets he has taken on the horse. But soon the commentator is calling the favourite as \u201ccruising up to lead\u201d and the crowd\u2019s answering roar drowns him out. Three Geordie lads are jumping up and down after Coo Star Sivola holds on by a neck, half an hour later. Darren explains why he stuck \u00a3100 on: \u201cI had a couple too many drinks in Birmingham, had a dream about the horse and thought, I best back it big. I\u2019ve never been so shaking in me life.\u201d \u201cHe had an epiphany!\u201d shouts his mate, Jamie. \u201cRight after he was sick \u2026\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
