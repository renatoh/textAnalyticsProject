At the close on Friday, they were trading just above 90p, 20p above the price of the one-for-one rights issue. Some of the hedge funds that had been shorting the stock ahead of the issue appeared to have closed out their positions, helping to reduce the volatility of the shares. Leading investors say that they were impressed by the performance of Andy Haste, who was installed as chief executive six months ago, as he explained the rights issue. However, many investors say that they still have reservations about the prospects for the company. 'We genuinely believe that future bad news is provided for,' said one leading shareholder. Most of the rights issue money will be used to provide against potential claims in its American business, including asbestos-related liabilities, which is now being wound down. He added that the third-quarter results, which are due to be released next month, are likely to be good. This is partly because of increasing rates but also because the group is likely to have held back some of the good news from the interim results, which were accompanied by the fund-raising. Another investor said that the issue was 'terrible', although he then admitted that his funds would probably still take up their entitlement. RSA's shares have fallen sharply over the last month -the day before the rights issue they were more than 150p - as investors realised the full extent of the group's problems. As well as the rights issue, Royal &amp; Sun Alliance has been selling off its businesses. This has included divesting its Australian interests, and it has also closed its life insurance operation to all new business."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
