I know that because I grew up there and worked as a reporter for the local weekly, compiling wedding reports and writing captions to pictures of amusingly shaped marrows. The only noteworthy event I can recall was the day when the newspaper's own offices were accidentally burnt down during the demolition of an ancient printing press. Last Sunday night, soon after England lost to France in the first round of Euro 2004, Boston was ablaze again. Two police cars were overturned and torched, Threshers off-licence was set alight, and a gang of 70 men rampaged through one of the quietest small market towns in England. Store fronts were vandalised, and the contents looted. Not since Anderson of the Fens led the anti-enclosure riots in the 17th century had the rural east of England seen such aggression. 'They even smashed the charity shop windows,' my mother said. Next day, in Albufeira, a more familiar spectacle was taking place: 250 England fans yelled insults at the Germans and taunted black Portuguese bystanders prior to pelting riot police with bottles. So far, so normal, except for the names on the charge sheet. Those accused of involvement in drunken violence included the grandson of a police chief, the son of a catering boss and the child of an Oxford don. England, the Daily Mail reported, has been 'shamed by the middle-class yobs'. Actually, the middle classes are accomplished law-breakers, albeit mainly of the white-collar type. Whipping up hatred, against witches, paedophiles or fellow contestants in the Big Brother house, has never been the sole province of the lowest socio-economic orders. Nor are the two top Aslef executives caught brawling at a barbecue classifiable as social plankton. Even so, the spectre of professors emeritus of Sanskrit legless on Super Bock and trashing seafront bars evokes one of JG Ballard's futuristic nightmares. The mob, it seems, has been democratised. Away from the Portuguese police cells, other barriers of class and sport are breaking down. Wayne Rooney, an authentic working-class hero, replaces the dandified Beckham as the national idol, and Royal Ascot, once a toffs' stronghold, is thick with hats from Accessorize, the scent of frying onions and tanked-up merchant bankers on the pull. A Pimm's proletariat has emerged, while genteel lager-swillers form the new yobbocracy. Eager to dispel such notions, some commentators are shoring up old stereotypes. At least two pundits have argued that soccer hooligans are the product of Britain's Industrial Revolution, when all that sweaty manual work forced labourers to hang around in ale-houses instead of going home for their tea. If such theorists read Emile Zola's Germinal, they might realise that other 19th-century Europeans survived workplaces less fragrant than, say, the offices of Vogue without spawning tribes of tin-bath thickos hot-wired for mayhem. There is another view, advanced by Cliff Stott, a psychologist and police adviser currently observing events in Portugal. He thinks that outside threats, such as officers with truncheons, are perceived as a challenge to English maleness. That, in turn, converts a group of hardcore troublemakers and ordinary drunks into a battleforce. Dr Stott's research is persuasive. It introduces the issue of identity. It allows for the rise of the posh thug in Albufeira. But it does not wholly explain events in Boston, Lincs, where you are as likely to see a riot cop as to clap eyes on Brad Pitt. Other hotspots of UK soccer trouble have their own chronicles. This is Boston's backdrop to a riot. Old industries have died gradually and sink estates grown up. But the climate of unrest solidified quite recently, when immigrant workers arrived to do tough, poorly paid agricultural work, such as potato picking. Though locals do not want their jobs, some bitterly resent their presence. The incomers live and work legitimately, but a core of residents will not, or cannot, distinguish them from the bogus asylum seekers of whom they are always reading. According to a senior professional in the town, the football was just a catalyst for latent violence. Obviously, the proximate cause of soccer fights, and most other brawls, is binge-drinking. Again, that is a symptom. Hand-wringing over how to curb the British disease tends not to address the many complex causes, of which insecurity and nationalism are somewhere in the mix. I imagine that the UK Independence Party has acquired some loyalists in Boston. Overall, Ukip polled 26.05 per cent of the vote in the east Midlands bloc, a whisker behind the Tories. Clearly, not all soccer rioters are anti-European. Not every xenophobe is a beer-bellied pugilist sun-baked to the colour of blancmange. Quite the reverse. Robert Kilroy-Silk, a shrewd operator much feared by many in the major parties, is an impeccably groomed example of the thinking man's bigot. And yet, in a week when everything centres on Europe, it is impossible quite to disentangle the bottle throwing and the political classes. Yobs berating 'fucking foreigners' in Portugal may not quite be Ukip in designer nylon, but they are certainly the provisional wing of the BNP. They are also closer to the national soul than law-abiding England would dare allow. At some never-acknowledged level, the country identifies with its hooligans. The media, eager to whip up hysteria, would feel strangely cheated if yobs all started drinking carrot juice and listening to Carole King CDs, while upright citizens are happy to condone summary justice, aggressive policing and whatever tactics are required to quell those who shame the nation. That stridency disguises the fact that Europhobia binds some hooligans to their critics. The impulse that turns a boozed-up crowd into an army also converts a jumble of racists and malcontents into a 17 per cent vote for Ukip. The genesis of a political party is, in at least one respect, identical to the birth of a riot. Both are about creating critical mass. That is not a defence of soccer hooligans. Euro 2004 has thrown up images awful even beyond the English norm. Especially horrifying are the stories of drunken fathers screaming at policemen, as their small and exhausted children look on. In term time, and way past midnight, tomorrow's rioters are being groomed. Such images may affront the middle classes. They do not entitle them to pin what is happening on alien low-lifers unlinked to decent society. Sport may be a classless activity now, but so is a particular kind of prejudice. Ukip is on a roll. A Janus-faced Prime Minister tries to sound placatory in Europe and tough at home. Violence off the pitch and rows in the debating rooms may be smoothed over. We might beat Croatia tomorrow and fans, from Portugal to Lincolnshire, might celebrate in peace. Tony Blair has endorsed the constitution, and this good. But the conditions that allow protest to fester are barely being addressed. Discontent, uncertainty, boredom and disillusion risk becoming an indelible feature of the English culture. In Euro-soccer, as in Euro-politics, unrest lives on, to fight another day. mary.riddell@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
