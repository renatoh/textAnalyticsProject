West Ham will travel across the capital on Saturday with the England forward available and eager to feature having been restricted by injury to 20 minutes of Premier League football since February. Carroll played briefly under Pardew at Newcastle United, scoring in the manager\u2019s first two games before being sold \u2013 much to the coach\u2019s frustration \u2013 to Liverpool in January 2011. Sam Allardyce has suggested the striker \u201ctreats life too casually\u201d in his autobiography, which has been serialised in the Sun this week, though Pardew offered only praise of his talent. \u201cAndy was playing long before I got to Newcastle and was a good player, but he\u2019s an outstanding No9 and has only really been restricted by the injuries he\u2019s suffered,\u201d he said. \u201cHe gives you a powerful presence at the top of the pitch, and at set plays. His technical ability is underrated in my opinion, and I\u2019ve always found him to be a real winner on the pitch. \u201cWhen you have that kind of determination and aggression, there aren\u2019t many strikers with the same aggression as him on crosses. He will slam into a centre-half to try and score: not in an illegal way, but he gets bumps and bruises and it\u2019s his bravery that gets him into trouble at times. There aren\u2019t many strikers who are completely unplayable, and he\u2019s one of them. He carries a presence up there. \u201cAt Newcastle I never had that problem with him. I thought he worked very hard for the cause. He is from Newcastle so there was no hiding place for him, but he has also suffered injuries at West Ham. Maybe Sam never saw him get up to speed. It always seemed to be one after the other, so I can understand why Sam said that. By the same token, I do think if he can get 15 games under his belt, there\u2019s no problem with his work-rate. I\u2019m pleased he\u2019s back. I hope he gets a free run from injury because he\u2019s a fine player, but he\u2019s got a lot to do to get into the team because [Diafra] Sakho is a very good player.\u201d Pardew spent around \u00a36m to bring Wickham to Palace from Sunderland over the summer. The England Under-21s striker is awaiting a first goal for his new club, having impressed particularly in the victory at Chelsea in September. That remains his last appearance to date after persistent ankle trouble though the former Ipswich forward, along with Joel Ward and Marouane Chamakh, should be fit enough to return for the League Cup tie at Manchester City on 28 October. \u201cI see a lot of similarities between Connor and Andy,\u201d added Pardew. \u201cI don\u2019t think Connor will ever be quite as powerful in the air as Andy \u2013 if the delivery is perfect for him, Andy\u2019s the one you\u2019d want going to attack it \u2013 but he\u2019s got a bit more pace and technical play that can equal Andy. I\u2019m hoping he gets to the same level as Andy when he comes back. He was really good in his last game at Chelsea when we won. \u201cIt had been a long time for him not playing through the middle, and it was always about a process with him. I think he\u2019s done well here. It\u2019s just unfortunate he\u2019s had this injury. We missed him initially, though we\u2019ve got round that now. Dwight Gayle is doing well, so he\u2019s got to earn his right to get back in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
