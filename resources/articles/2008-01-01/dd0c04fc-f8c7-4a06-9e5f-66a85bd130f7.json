Her death from a streptococcal infection was sudden, just two days after giving birth in hospital to her third child. Open and engaged with all who met her, Amy was an enthusiastic mathematician committed to imparting a love of her subject to those she taught. She demanded high standards of herself and of her pupils. She was determined to show the girls in her classes how maths is used in the real world and, in this way, to provoke interest in the more reluctant mathematicians. Brought up in Hemingford Grey, in Cambridgeshire, the youngest of three sisters, she dragged her parents to pony club events and ate a tremendous quantity of apples. She is the only child I know who received a box as a birthday present from her aunt and was delighted. She studied engineering science at Balliol College, Oxford, but concluded that a real engineering career was not for her, prompted perhaps by our lack of success as partners for practical experiments. On completing her degree in 1989, she went to Zimbabwe to teach maths at St James school in Nyamandlovu, near Bulawayo. What started as an opportunity to see more of the world triggered her vocation. The girls' enthusiasm to learn drew out in Amy an enthusiasm and talent for teaching. After returning to the UK in 1991, she qualified as a teacher at the Institute of Education in London and went on to teach at South Hampstead high school, St Paul's girls' school and latterly, as head of maths, at St Swithun's, Winchester. Her commitment to her teaching was out-matched only by her commitment to her family. She met John, her husband, in Africa when he was working as a geologist in Botswana, having driven all the way from London in his beloved Land-Rover. In 1997, they married and children Oliver, Alice and Tessa, the baby born just before Amy's death, followed - a lovely family from whom she has been taken much too soon."}, "isHosted": false}}}
