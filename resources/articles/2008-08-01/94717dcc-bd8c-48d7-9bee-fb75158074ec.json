The burning issues among the club's supporters are, in no particular order, William Gallas' right to wear the captain's armband and Emmanuel Adebayor's right to wear the shirt at all. Adebayor was booed again when he was introduced as a substitute in the 4-0 win over Steve McClaren's FC Twente on Wednesday night, a result that secured 6-0 aggregate progress from the Champions League final qualifying round. Clichy, though, addressed both issues on behalf on the dressing-room with a sureness of touch, not to mention helpings of humility, to suggest that Arsene Wenger has a hitherto unheralded leader in his ranks. The 23-year-old's talent has already been widely lauded. Having been named to the PFA's Team of the Season last time out, the left-back has risen above Arsenal's stuttering start to the new campaign with a series of dynamic performances. He was even called up to the France squad by Raymond Domenech for last Wednesday's friendly against Sweden, although he did not get on to win his first cap. His poise and maturity off the field, though, is a boon for Wenger. \"William showed what a great player he is against FC Twente,\" said Clichy, in the wake of fresh criticism of Gallas's leadership, a subject that first flared when he staged his infamous sit-in protest after the 2-2 Premier League draw at Birmingham City last February. \"Everyone has bad times; last season at Birmingham, I made a big mistake [by conceding the injury-time penalty that led to the equaliser]. That was my thing. \"William is a big player, a more experienced player and he is the captain, so when people look for someone to blame, unfortunately it is him. But the players don't think that is right. We don't blame him for everything, everyone makes mistakes. I made a mistake, like I said [at Birmingham]. Everyone is behind William and it will remain like this.\" The same is true of Adebayor, whose flirtations with Barcelona and Milan over the summer have so incensed sections of the Arsenal support. \"The big thing is to feel that you are wanted by your club, manager, teammates and the fans,\" said Clichy. \"It was a big disappointment for the fans to see what happened during the summer but Ade is a big, big player; last year, he showed he has the quality to be one of the best in Europe, so we just have to be behind him. I am sure if he starts scoring goals and in December, he is on 15-20 goals, everything will be fine.\" Clichy has entered his sixth season at the club \u2014 only Kolo Tour\u00e9 from the current squad has more years of service \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and he is determined to add to his only medal, the 2003-04 Premier League title with the so-called 'Invincibles'. He missed out on the FA Cup final triumph over Manchester United the following season because of a broken metatarsal. \"We have to win things, that is the main objective \u2014 to win something this year,\" said Clichy, whose \u00a3200,000 signing from Cannes ranks alongside the bargains of recent seasons. \"If we can win things the way we play, it would be even better because football is about entertaining people and taking pleasure, and that's what we are doing at Arsenal. I hope that this year will be a good one for us. I am sure we can do it. \"The FC Twente game was about bouncing back from the defeat at Fulham on Saturday. That was not good enough, it was a big blow for us but we learned from it and it won't happen again.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
