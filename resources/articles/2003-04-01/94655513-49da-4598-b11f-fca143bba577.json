Remember Roy Essandoh, the emergency striker signed via a plea on Teletext for a Wycombe Wanderers team in the midst of an injury crisis two years ago? Said striker, who might as well have come from the moon for all manager Lawrie Sanchez or anyone else at Second Division Wycombe knew, promptly turned up and scored the match-winner to slay Leicester City, then of the Premiership. There is something about Michael Chopra's sudden, sensational arrival at Watford, just in time for a mammoth game, that has the whiff of a similarly memorable story. Chopra's footballing pedigree may be considerably more refined than that of Essandoh, but were he to emerge into the spotlight of an FA Cup semi-final to help his temporary team overcome hot favourites Southampton, the achievement would be no less significant. Chopra is 19. On loan from Newcastle United, he helped himself to an astonishing four goals in last weekend's 7-4 victory at Burnley in only his second game for the Hornets. The young striker has had a thrilling impact at Vicarage Road. As manager Ray Lewington said: 'We brought him to be nice and fresh and brighten the place up. I don't think it's a coincidence that we've scored 10 goals in the last three games because he's just livened everyone up.' Although the likes of Sir Bobby Robson and Alan Shearer remain exasperated that Newcastle's own campaign for a trophy they view as the Holy Grail was blown at the first hurdle, a pocket of FA Cup fever burns on in the city. Chopra's parents run a successful chain of corner shops in Newcastle's West End. Everyone is aware of this special talent, who has been talked about in reverential tones since childhood, in a similar vein to the expectancy that preceded Joe Cole's debut for West Ham United in 1999. Chopra, whose mother is a Geordie and whose father is a second-generation Indian, has long dreamt of becoming the Premiership's first Asian player, attempting to beat the Leeds United winger of whom George Graham once raved: 'Who needs Ryan Giggs when we've got Harpal Singh?' Both are still waiting for the honour, although Chopra, who has rewritten Newcastle's youth scoring records and has been capped at every level for England boys, has made two appearances as a substitute in the Champions League this season and one in the Worthington Cup. Biding his time has become a necessity as Newcastle carefully nurture a youngster whose natural footballing gifts are not matched with the athleticism that is a prerequisite in the Premiership. The loan spell at Watford is intended to toughen him up. Shearer, who takes a personal interest in Chopra given that they went to the same school in Gosforth, is optimistic. 'Michael is not physically strong yet, but that will come,' the Newcastle captain said. 'I could see him replacing me in two or three years' time.' Shearer recommended the promising young player to his agents, SFX, who know that they are potentially on to something huge. Chopra's pin-up looks and Asian heritage (he is an active supporter of the Elswick Tigers, a local football club for young black and Asian boys and girls) gives him huge marketing possibilities. It is just a case of waiting for the footballer to take off. Chopra, who has trained with the first team at St James' Park since he was 17, will be 20 in December. Patience, said Robson, is imperative. 'He's different to Wayne Rooney, slighter and older, and both he and we need to be patient, but he's going to be great,' the Newcastle manager insisted. 'He's a young Shearer, that sort of player, and I mean that. He puts his foot in, which we like, he's got great movement, he knows how to time his runs and he can finish.' No won der Watford tried so relentlessly to borrow his services. A lesson about biding time is personified by a player upon whose shoulders a good deal is loaded in the other semi-final, Sheffield United's Michael Brown. The 26-year-old was a teenager destined for greatness at Manchester City, a lad who figured prominently for one season in the Premiership at the tender age of 18, when City were relegated from the top flight under Joe Royle. He went on to play for the England under-21 team. Fostering Brown's reputation as a bad lad in with a dodgy crowd, Royle soon tired of trying to eke out talent that was notoriously enigmatic and slow burning. No one at City seemed bothered when the midfielder left for \u00a3400,000 three years ago. 'Man City were that keen to get rid of him, they let us pay over four years - I don't think we've paid for him yet!' boasts Blades manager Neil Warnock. 'In the past, he has been criticised because he's had his moments on and off the field. But I tend to sign players with a bad reputation or when nobody wants them. You're not always right, but it's nice when you can get something out of nothing.' Something indeed. Having finally blossomed this season, helped along the way by advice from the old train chugging alongside him, Stuart McCall, Brown has been inspirational in midfield, chipping in with 17 goals, marvellous in both number and execution. Assistant manager Kevin Blackwell, who was sceptical when Warnock expressed an interest in Brown, is completely won over. 'The past two years have been about trying to get Browny to believe in himself and work within a team unit,' Blackwell said. 'Right now, on top of his game, there aren't many midfield players in the country who are able to do on a consistent basis what he can do. When you look at the Premiership sides we've played this year [Leeds and Liverpool twice and Sunderland once], Browny has been the outstanding midfield player in most of the games. He can go as far as Michael Brown wants to go. He has got all the armoury, he's got the tackling, he can head and he can score goals and that's what you look for in a midfield player. If Michael does anything better than he's doing now, he'd be worth \u00a315 million.' Expectations, expectations. Brown is mature enough to handle them more wisely these days. For Chopra, the story is about to unfold. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
