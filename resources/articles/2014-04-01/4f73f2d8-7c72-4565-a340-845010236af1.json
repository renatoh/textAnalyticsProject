Yvette Cooper will also propose minimum custodial sentences for wholesale employment of illegal immigrants. The measures are designed to reassure British workers that immigrant labour will not undercut their wages but the specific proposal is legally fraught since employers will be concerned that it could give the state greater control over the setting of wages in the private sector above and beyond the minimum wage. The current law on forced labour requires an element of coercion or deception between the defendant and the victim, such as unwarranted and perhaps unexplained deductions from wages, poor accommodation provided by the employer, the employer not paying the full tax or national insurance contributions for the worker. In a speech Cooper will say: \"We want clearer, stronger laws so businesses know where they stand and responsible employers know they won't be undercut, but so that it is clear that employers who use pressure or force to exploit people and get round employment law are committing a crime. The truth is that for too long exploitation in the labour market \u2013 a cause and effect of low-skilled immigration and illegal immigration \u2013 has gone unchecked.\" She will also commit to introduce proper exit checks as part of UK border policy as well as the taking of fingerprints of illegal immigrants caught at Calais to help further action if they try to re-enter the UK. She will also unveil an independent review by former chief constable and security expert Peter Neyroud into UK border controls. For the past year Cooper has tried to chart a distinctive path on immigration by arguing that part of the pull of overseas workers for employers is cheap wages that undercut the bargaining power of indigenous workers. Labour knows that immigration welfare and the economy are the three issues that are still hitting Labour in the polls . Cooper will also admit that \"the last Labour government got things wrong on immigration. We should have had transitional controls in place for eastern Europe. The figures were wrong, and migration was far greater than we expected. As a result ,the pace and scale of immigration was too great and it is right to bring it down. And we should have recognised more quickly the impact on low skilled jobs, and the worries people had.\" But she will claim the Conservative approach of promising to get net immigration down below100,000 has patently failed, leaving the UK in the \"worst of all worlds\". She will implicitly attack the approach of UKIP, saying simplistic solutions ramp up the rhetoric, raise false promises and expectations, undermine trust and confidence, and create division and hostility. \"It pretends we can build a wall and hide behind it, scared to look out.\" She will promise ahead of the European elections: \" We won't engage in an arms race of rhetoric, and we reject the divisive politics of the right that promotes hostility instead of building consensus .\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
