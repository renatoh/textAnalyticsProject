Life after No 10 can be tough on former prime ministers. Roy Jenkins, who failed to get to the very top, admitted in his memoirs that he would have liked to have done so, but immediately added that he had lived a happier old age than most who succeeded. It is too early to judge Tony Blair's retirement, let alone Brown's, whose declared austerity in pursuit of good causes is modelled more on Jimmy Carter than on Blair's high maintenance lifestyle. The former US president \u2013 now 86 and, like Brown, a better man than a politician \u2013 is still championing peace and the poor 30 years after his defeat by the wily Ronald Reagan. Lady Thatcher's case best makes Jenkins's point. \"Happiness is not doing nothing\" and \"my definition of hell is having a lot of time\", she used to say. A workaholic with no interests outside politics, Thatcher burned with a barely concealed sense of injustice (\"I have never been defeated\"), much like Edward Heath's 25-year public sulk after she ousted him in 1975. Trying to be a backseat driver, she slipped gently into irrelevance, but this weekend she re-emerged in a poll commissioned by the website MyDaily, no longer a hate figure but judged by a third of those surveyed to be the world's most influential woman. As with Blair and the ever-charismatic Bill Clinton, Thatcher the pensioner threw herself into the lucrative global lecture circuit, promoting her foundation: in her case, it was Thatcherite freedoms; for Blair, it was sport, faith and Africa; for Clinton, Aids, poverty, ethnic conflict and much else. Both men were much more clubbable than Thatcher or Brown, although he too has Africa in his portfolio of interests, as well as a place on Tim Berners-Lee's World Wide Web Foundation. Ted Heath had intellectual pursuits, notably music, to augment his continuing activism as a backbench MP \u2013 he stood down in 2001 \u2013 and, like most former PMs, his money-making and self-justificatory memoirs, a 14-year project in his case. Thatcher cashed in quickly. Blair loyally waited until Brown had left office. Brown has already dashed off a book on his finest hour, the banking crisis \u2013 it will be in shops for Christmas. The evidence suggests that the key to a successful No 10 afterlife is to leave day-to-day politics and mean it, or at least accept defeat with good grace. Like AJ Balfour before him, Sir Alec Douglas-Home came back as foreign secretary. John Major disappeared into private banking and cricket, making only rare and well-judged interventions into political controversy. Jim Callaghan, who stayed on as party leader for a year after his defeat to try and steer the succession towards Denis Healey (Clement Attlee had also tried and failed to do the same for Nye Bevan), was realistic about his limited influence. \"When it is all over, there is still family,\" Callaghan once observed, and found contentment in old age with family and his Sussex farm as Thatcher could not and Harold Wilson, gradually slipping towards senility, did not either. It helps to be older in office so that retirement is the next, natural step. Callaghan was 67 when he lost the 1979 election. Churchill retired (very reluctantly) at 80 for an unhappy last decade. Wilson, fearing illness, went at 60. Likewise Harold Macmillan with an incorrect cancer diagnosis at 69. He lived 23 more years, long enough to get a second wind and attack Thatcher's onslaught on his economic hero, Keynes. The taciturn Attlee retired happily with his beloved wife, Vi, and he became garrulous: \"I have arrived at the years of irresponsibility,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter a hoot what I say.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
