The more obvious touchstone, at least on their second album, which reached No 1 in Australia, is the California-dreaming stratum of 1970s rock. The opening trinity of Southern Sun, Old Town Blues and the title track, in fact, are clearly lost out-takes from Fleetwood Mac's eponymous 1975 album \u2013 or may as well be. That's how precisely they've nailed the tequila-sunrise mellowness, which acts as a gateway to an albumful of emollient soft rock. It's seductive stuff, pushing all the right wistfulness/optimism buttons and allowing the songs time to flow to a leisurely conclusion. One song ends in a brave skirl of Kenny G-style sax \u2013 that's how committed they are. Vocalist Dave Hosking is a moving purveyor of precarious emotional states \u2013 his bleakness on Bridges, a dream/nightmare memoir of their first American tour, is genuinely painful. End of the Line, by the way, dips a toe into folky diddlement you could call Mumfordian, but it's easy to skip."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
