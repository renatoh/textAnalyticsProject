Seven severe \u201cdanger to life\u201d flood warnings remain in place in South Yorkshire in areas along the River Don. The Met Office also issued 41 active flood warnings and 94 flood alerts, and said a weather system moving across Europe would bring a \u201cfair amount\u201d of rainfall to England and Wales. Widespread flooding affected towns across the Midlands and northern England on Thursday and Friday. The body of Annie Hall, the former high sheriff of Derbyshire, was found in the River Derwent on Friday morning after she was swept away by flood water in Darley Dale near Matlock. Parts of the village of Fishlake near Doncaster in South Yorkshire were still cut off on Sunday, and under a metre (3ft) of water from the nearby River Don. Only tractors were able to get in by road. The local council called on residents to evacuate their homes. A rest centre was set up on at nearby Stainforth community centre for evacuees. Among visibly shaken arrivals from Fishlake were Chris Davies and Lorraine Healy. The flood waters rose so quickly on Friday evening that they were only able to grab two small plastic bags of clothing, and their three animals, a rabbit and two parrots, they said. \u201cMy whole car was under water. It took 30 minutes for everything to get flooded,\u201d said Davies, 33. His rabbit Amber and parrot Jojo were safe but his other parrot, Ruby, had died of stress, he said.. He thought his house must be under four or five feet of water. He and Healy had borrowed money to stay at a local hotel in Lakeside, he said. Dan Greenslade, also from Fishlake, had been trying to get back to his flooded house after his girlfriend gave birth to their daughter on Friday. \u201cI know it\u2019s under water. A neighbour sent some pictures of the outside of it. But that was yesterday, and they say the waters are rising,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just decorated it and we moved in three weeks ago to get ready for the baby.\u201d They were staying with his girlfriend\u2019s parents in a nearby village, and friends had donated a Moses basket and baby clothes. \u201cSo the baby\u2019s OK. But all of her stuff is at our house.\u201d Nigel and Stephanie Roberts, who moved to Fishlake two months ago had been staying with their son in neighbouring Hatfield since the early hours of Saturday. They were hoping to hitch a ride to their home with a food convoy to rescue their parrot, Del Boy, who was stranded on the top floor. Stephanie said: \u201cThe garage started to flood about an inch and within two hours we had a foot of water. Then it entered the house and the kitchen. It was bubbling up through the floorboards.\u201d About half of Fishlake\u2019s 700 residents had already left, some spending Saturday in the Hare and Hounds pub, and others seeking shelter and company in the church. Others were staying in the upper floors of their homes. Some remaining residents have criticised Doncaster council for leaving them stranded. The council said it was unable to provide \u201con-the-ground support\u201d because the area was covered by a severe flood warning and the advice was for residents to evacuate. Roselyn Jones, Doncaster\u2019s mayor, said the Environment Agency had warned the water level could rise further. \u201cThe recommendation is to evacuate. Our first priority is preserving life,\u201d she said. The Hare and Hounds were supplying food to those stranded in their homes, but the landlords, Angie and Scott Godfrey, tsaid on social media on Sunday that they were \u201cfuming\u201d that Doncaster council had not kept them supplied. \u201cWe have been inundated with calls, messages from people wanting a HOT MEAL. These people have no electricity &amp; are living upstairs. We have the equipment to cook the lunches, we just need the food!!\u201d they wrote on Facebook. South Yorkshire police said it had extra officers working in Doncaster to patrol and protect the evacuated areas. The Environment Agency said water levels on the Don had peaked in most places and were receding, but warned of more wet weather that \u201crivers may respond quickly to\u201d on Monday and asked people to sign up to flood warnings. Sophie Yeomans at the Met Office said it was going to be an \u201cunsettled week in terms of rain\u201d. The forecast was for rain to reach Northern Ireland on Sunday evening, before affecting Wales and north-west England later and then spreading across the rest of the UK into Monday morning. Northern Rail said disruption in South Yorkshire could continue until Tuesday morning in some areas and that a significant amount of work was required before the tracks were cleared. Flood waters continued to subside, but tracks in several locations remained under water and debris and damage were surfacing as they receded, it said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
