The Chelsea manager has received plaudits for introducing a number of academy talents into the first team. But with the club\u2019s transfer ban lifted, and as much as \u00a3150m to spend, Lampard may have to curb the opportunities available to some youngsters. That, however, is a challenge the 41-year-old is happy to take on. \u201cI haven\u2019t banned the talk [about the January window] but I am not going to set out to engage in it,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cIf players want to come and see me and talk then I will happily have a conversation with them individually, but that hasn\u2019t happened. \u201cI think the thing with the young players ... I speak to them regularly. I can be, not hard on them, but I push them because I think they need that. I think they feel the trust I have in them because they know I\u2019m prepared to give them the opportunities if they train well and they come in the team and play well. I think they should naturally feel a little bit of tension all the time so that\u2019s not the worst thing. \u201cThey just need to work and believe in their own talents because their talent is there for all to see. We also have to be patient with that because it may take different periods of time for them to fully blossom as players. They might have a period in and out of the team, have a run of the games and then not. I am prepared to stick with them through that because I really believe in them.\u201d Lampard said he has had \u201cvery open\u201d conversations about transfer priorities with the director, Marina Granovskaia, and before Saturday\u2019s Premier League fixture with Bournemouth, laid out what he believes are the essential qualities in any signing. \u201cI have had very open conversations with Marina which is speaking to the owner as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cI can speak to either of those, but mainly Marina. And the scouting department, and Petr Cech. I sit with my staff daily for hours, we also talk about the team and how we can improve, and at some points you start thinking about the longer term future. The conversations have been very open to this point so I am happy with it. But of course we haven\u2019t bought anyone.\u201d Asked about the qualities any arrivals must have, Lampard said: \u201cWork ethic. A capacity to run and then a desire to do it, because they are not always the same thing. A will to win and to be successful at the club. Of course we want to sign talented players, that\u2019s obvious, but [attitude] is a huge thing for me because if you look at it, and people keep talking about balance and [not to] upset the squad, then we want people to come here with a real intention to be a success.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
