Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed GDP in the second quarter of 2001 (April to June) grew by 0.4% - revised up from the 0.3% previously estimated. The figures compare with 0.6% gross recorded in the first quarter - which was also revised up today, from the previous estimate of 0.5%. Economists had expected this month's figures to show GDP to be unchanged at 0.3% with some pointing to risk of a downward nudge. The figures today continued to show a two-speed economy with the struggling manufacturing sector continuing to suffer but services registering growth. Output from production industries slumped by 1.1% hit by a sharp 2% fall in manufacturing. Manufacturing output was hit by weaker demand for mobile phones, electric products and computer industries. But output from the services industries rose 0.9% with gross in telecoms, real estate, renting and business services. However following the US attacks two weeks ago, the markets will be more concerned with economic growth in the months ahead rather than the previous quarters. Economists are pointing to GDP registering an increase of below 2% for 2001 as a whole with the aftermath of the terror attacks adding more uncertainty to the equation. ONS figures showed the level of GDP in 2000 was 2.9% above 1999."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
