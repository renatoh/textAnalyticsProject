He expects the parliamentary vote on fees to be held in the next three weeks, and hopes that as many as half of Lib Dem backbench MPs will vote against. In a column in the Guardian he says the coalition plan is \"not financial, but ideological\". Meanwhile, Steve Smith, head of Universities UK, the representative body for 133 universities, is to warn the government today that there will be turmoil if no consensus is found on fees. Speaking in a debate, Prof Smith will warn: \"The economic environment has led to an unpalatable choice \u2026 Cutting student numbers would do more harm to social mobility than an increased graduate contribution \u2026 \"UUK has consistently opposed disproportionate cuts to the higher education budget. Our support for the government proposals is therefore only conditional upon a long-term commitment to public investment in higher education.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
