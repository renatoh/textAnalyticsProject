City are two points clear of Manchester United before Blackburn Rovers' visit for the late kick-off match on Saturday as they aim to win a first championship since 1968. The playmaker Silva, a member of Vicente del Bosque's Spain squad, said: \"The Premier League and the World Cup are equally important to me. After winning such an important title as the World Cup, to win the Premier League and to see supporters in Manchester who have waited so long to win it would be important to me. \"Of course the World up came after the European Championship for Spain [in 2008], so people were used to winning. It's fantastic to see how people forget all the bad things in life when they start celebrating a title like that after so many years. I want Manchester people to enjoy this feeling.\" Rovers' visit marks a year since City last dropped a point at home when Fulham drew 1-1 and Joleon Lescott said of the run: \"It's not something we set out at the start of the season or said: 'We've got to win every game at home.' But we go into home matches now really confident because of our record here; we're comfortable here and teams know that. It's not something you can really put your finger on. We set out to win every game whether it's here or away. Our tactics aren't that much different when we play here. Maybe it's the opposition who change because we've done so well here.\" With United playing at Norwich City on Sunday, City know a win over Rovers would stretch their lead to five points. Lescott said: \"Mentally and for confidence it is a big plus for us to continue to be top. It is nice every Monday morning. But Manchester United are a quality team so we cannot rest on our laurels. Spurs play Man United quite soon [next weekend] and that's a massive one. Maybe after that things will be a bit clearer. \"There are no easy games now. It is going to be a tough run-in. There are no poor teams at the bottom. It is consistency that they lack. On any given day Blackburn can pull out a good result. Look at what they did at Old Trafford [winning 3-2 on New Year's Eve]. We can't just think the game is won before we start.\" Regarding the threat of Yakubu Ayegbeni, a former team-mate of Lescott and scorer of 14 goals, the defender said: \"I know big Yak from my Everton days. He is a bubbly character. But if you switch off for a second, he will punish you. He has scored a lot of goals recently. If you look at his record, it is up there with the best. None of us will doubt his ability come the weekend.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
