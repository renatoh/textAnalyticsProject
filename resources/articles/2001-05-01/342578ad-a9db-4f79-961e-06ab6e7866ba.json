But we're not all blessed with supreme confidence. Some of us are actually a wee bit, well... shy. No, really. But shyness need not be a debilitating drag on your career as there are several steps you can take - some less expensive than others - to boost your confidence at work. You might, for example consider enrolling on a course at the Institute of Self-Actualisation (ISA) where over a long weekend you are involved in a variety of group discussions and exercises. As I found when I completed the course earlier this year, these interactions with instructors and other participants actually give you a chance to focus on yourself. I found it to be a challenging and exciting time, with a caring and warm atmosphere. The purpose of the ISA weekend, which costs just a little under \u00a3300, is not to swell your head, but to help you achieve the results that you want from your life. The course can help expand awareness of yourself and your relationships, and also the self-limiting boundaries that you have collected along the way. And over the course of the weekend, the instructors help you push through these boundaries. Not surprisingly ISA has its roots in the US but the Institute is now active in Sweden, Australia and the UK. Courses here take place every two months rotating between Bradford, Leeds and York where between 75 and 200 people of different ages, backgrounds and experiences take part. A separate programme of seminars and meetings is held in London and there is a support network of ISA 'graduates' who meet on a regular basis. If your confidence-boosting budget won't stretch to \u00a3300, hypnotherapy can be a less expensive route to beating shyness. Jenny Edwards, a psychotherapist and consultant in advanced hypnotherapy says that \"confidence is one of the essential parts of our make up that allows us to achieve our potential in life. \"Hypnotherapy is a speedy sub-discipline within psychotherapy which accesses the sub-conscious. With the right assistance you can alter the thought patterns at the root of your negative self-beliefs. People use hypnosis to address all kinds of work-related problems from job interviews, exam nerves and public speaking to chairing meetings, attending conferences, increasing motivation and achieving peak performance.\" Hypnosis is a state of heightened awareness - you are not put to sleep or rendered unconscious. You are supposed to be completely aware of what is happening and able to stop the session at any moment. \"It is generally described as a pleasant, lethargic feeling. Some people say that their limbs feel heavy, and they are reluctant to move. It's like dosing in bed, so nice that you don't want to get up,\" says Jenny. If you need immediate help with a problem then two or three sessions might be enough to crack it. If however you have a more deep-seated problem such as low confidence and self-esteem then you might need half-a-dozen or more sessions. Cost can vary from \u00a330 to \u00a3100 a session depending on where you live. If you can't afford hypnosis or a course then a self-help book is your cheapest option. Brian Roet's book The Confidence To Be Yourself , for example, offers practical techniques to help improve your self-esteem and encourage positive ways of thinking. \"Lack of confidence can prevent people from getting the job they want,\" says Brian. \"If you go into a job interview and you are not confident then it shows. \"When I work with clients I look at feelings, because lack of confidence is a combination of feelings and thought. The feeling that I am not good enough, I should do better. This is a belief system, but a belief system that is not based on reality.\" The book offers exercises at the end of each chapter as practical pointers towards changing your self-beliefs. Being Happy by Andrew Mathews is another useful book exploring confidence and how to achieve it. Illustrated with cartoons, it offers insights into understanding yourself and being able to laugh and forgive yourself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
