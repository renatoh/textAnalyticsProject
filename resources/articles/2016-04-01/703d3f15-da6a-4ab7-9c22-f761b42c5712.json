Families, eh? Where\u2019s Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s conscious uncoupling when you need it? No matter whose side you\u2019re on (and I am taking the Papa Don\u2019t Preach route here: I think they\u2019re all in deep trouble), it\u2019s clear that the 15-year-old has his own ideas about what he\u2019d like to do with his life. The question is: should that count? Madonna is apparently annoyed that her teenage son has been taken out of school to go on holiday and wants to step in to save his education. This is confusing to me because I don\u2019t know any schools that are not actually on holiday at the moment. Unless he is planning to be in the Maldives when his school term restarts. Or unless I am moving in the wrong circles. I mean, I only know people who have taken their kids out of school to go to a really nice Airbnb place in Margate and they felt so bad about it they couldn\u2019t enjoy it. Anyway. What\u2019s interesting about this situation is not so much the ins and outs of an individual family\u2019s situation but instead what this particular case demonstrates about how attitudes have changed towards children\u2019s rights. It\u2019s almost expected now that the opinion of a 15-year-old counts as much, if not more, than the opinion of each of the parents. As Jill Lepore wrote in her brilliant report on child protection in the US in the New Yorker in February, historically speaking we have only really very recently come to regard children as human beings at all. Let alone as human beings who may know better than adults what\u2019s good for them. And suddenly they have an awful lot of agency. Maybe too much agency? In 1973, Hillary Clinton, then a lawyer, was writing in the Harvard Educational Review that children\u2019s rights were \u201ca slogan in need of a definition\u201d. Now even if they\u2019re not clearly defined, they\u2019re assumed. The idea is that children supposedly know what they\u2019re doing and we should let them get on with it. The other underage case study in the news last week was nine-year-old \u201ccrime reporter\u201d Hilde Kate Lysiak from Selinsgrove, Pennysylvania. Her news blog The Orange Street News went viral when she was criticised for reporting on a local murder. \u201cTrolls\u201d and \u201chaters\u201d told her to \u201cgo back and play tea parties with your dollies\u201d. This response was a rude and nasty lesson in what happens when you provide internet content for grown-ups. They frequently respond childishly. Then there was an immediate backlash as Lysiak was hailed a heroine and a proactive role model for young women. She was even described as \u201cthe new Lois Lane\u201d, with people seeming to forget that Lois Lane was a) a fictional character and b) possibly the least skilled investigative reporter ever as she never worked out that Superman was standing right in front of her wearing a \u201ccunning disguise\u201d of glasses. But the main message coming out of The Orange Street News story was that every nine-year-old has a right to go around reporting on murders if they damn well want to. And shame on you for curtailing a child\u2019s freedom of expression if you try to stop her! The same logic would seem to dictate that every teenager has the right to decide which parent they side with in a divorce, regardless of the feelings and opinions of the adults involved. Here\u2019s the message: the child knows best. Leave the child alone. In reality, this is just as toxic a kneejerk reaction as the traditional opposite: \u201cMummy and Daddy know best.\u201d \u201cChildren should be seen and not heard.\u201d \u201cNo one cares what you think.\u201d Thank heavens these dismissive attitudes are seen as old fashioned and wrong, but what they\u2019re being replaced with is no better. Because children don\u2019t know best any more than adults do. And someone needs to be in charge. \u201cBest\u201d usually lies somewhere between the extremes, with adults taking the lead (because they are, er, adults!) and everyone listening to each other. And when agreement becomes impossible, getting expensive lawyers in. Or Gwyneth on speed dial. (I am actually surprised Gwyneth has not been able to sort things out here. At the very least she could have just stung them all with bees to bring them to their senses.) With Gwyneth unavailable, I asked my 12-year-old son how he would feel if his parents got divorced and he was not allowed to choose who to live with. (I did not ask him if he would like to report on a murder as I did not want to give him ideas.) He: \u201cI would be really annoyed if you didn\u2019t let me live with the person I wanted to live with. I\u2019m not saying I have a preference, by the way.\u201d (This child knows on which side his bread is buttered.) Me: \u201cWhat if, though, you wanted to live with your father and I thought that might be wrong for you and I really wanted you to be with me?\u201d A long pause. He: \u201cHmm. I can see it\u2019s complicated. You better not get divorced.\u201d This is the problem: it is complicated. It shouldn\u2019t be that children are never allowed a say. Nor should they necessarily be banned from having a Facebook page under parental supervision where they report on local news if this really is their passion. (Although a murder? Really?) But more than that they have a right to know that adults are looking after them. And rights can only really be protected by boundaries. And where there are no boundaries you end up either in the middle of a crime scene where one of your neighbours is suspected of attacking his wife with a hammer. Or you end up in the Maldives during term time. And in the long run neither of those are good places to be. Yes, even the Maldives."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
