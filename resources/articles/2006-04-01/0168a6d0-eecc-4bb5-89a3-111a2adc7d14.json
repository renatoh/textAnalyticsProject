I am having a baby in a few weeks, and this being the second time, I am only too aware that for the foreseeable future I will be spending rather less time musing on the symbolism of the Lanvinesque exposed zip than I will struggling to focus on Babygro poppers through a fog of sleep deprivation. In the light of this, today seems the right moment at which to share my thoughts on maternity wear, a subject to which I have devoted, naturally, a great deal of thought over the past eight months. In the interest of brevity I have distilled my findings into a five-point precis. One: make sure your clothes meet in the middle. The crop top and bump look is unutterably pass\u00e9, and gives the distinct impression that you are modelling your look on a pregnant All Saint, thereby inadvertently showing your age. Two: avoid shiny fabrics, bows and ribbons, as these will make you look like an Easter egg. Three: you have a choice as to whether to draw your, ahem, \"waist\" above or below the bump. As a rule, an empire line will emphasise the bump; a long top and low-rise trousers will diminish it. Four: rejoice in your freedom from the clutches of body fascism. Shapes that are comfortable but difficult to wear if you are not slender - DvF-style wrap dresses, smock tops - are excellent in pregnancy. Take this opportunity to reclaim them from the guilty-mistake section of your wardrobe. Five: the most important piece of your maternity wear is the element - a good pair of jeans, heels you can still wear, great jewellery - that makes you feel like yourself, rather than The Pregnant Lady. And finally, remember, as I have been telling myself all year: there is always next season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
