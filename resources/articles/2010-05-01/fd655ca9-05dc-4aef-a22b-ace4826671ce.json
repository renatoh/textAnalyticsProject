The various buildings on the 80-acre site depict different periods of life in the Highlands, but the one I was particularly interested in was the township or village. This cluster of buildings relates to life in the 1700s, based on the findings of an excavation of a settlement in the higher Spey Valley above the current hamlet of Lynchat. The largest building, which has a roof thatched of heather with a turf base, is for the tacksman. He had a slightly higher status than others, as he collected the rents and liaised on behalf of the other inhabitants directly to the local laird, their landlord. My interest was because a tacksman called John Fraser, 1772 to 1840, used to occupy a house on the site of our house; his roof would have been thatched and almost certain to have been heather over a turf base. Other houses in the township at Newtonmore included a stockman's house, and his role, as his name suggests, would have been to look after the community's livestock such as goats and cattle. The house has a cobbled stonewalled run where goats for milking may have been kept. The weaver's house is different as it is thatched with reed from the local extensive reedbeds of the Insh marshes. There is no byre attached so perhaps the weaver sold cloth in return for food rather than raise crops and cattle for a living. The weaver's loom inside is a replica of a 1700s model; it could produce a complex weave that, with dyes from wild plants, could have produced the much sought after tartan plaids. A very small window would have thrown light on to the loom. The whole experience of the museum provided a fascinating insight into the past and brought it back to life for us."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
