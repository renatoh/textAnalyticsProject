He\u2019s making a tilt for the prime ministership when the country goes to an election next year. There\u2019s concern he may be uncompetitive with his Labour rival. She\u2019s Jacinda Ardern. People don\u2019t know much about Bridges. Some people might remember that as a minister in John Key\u2019s National government, he signed off on oil and gas exploration in a \u201cpristine and untouched\u201d national conservation area, and then excused himself by announcing he didn\u2019t realise it was there. A rarefied few might remember that he is one of only a few New Zealanders who\u2019s ever had a personal superannuation fund. But everyone does seem to know he\u2019s stratospherically unpopular. How unpopular? He\u2019s polling as preferred prime minister at 9%. Yes. Mind you, Ardern has suffered a recent local 11% \u201ccrash\u201d in popularity \u2013 down to 38.4%. But when your total popularity isn\u2019t as large a margin than that by which your competitor\u2019s has dropped, you have something of an electoral problem. So in the run up to the election, Bridges has been visiting Australia to take election advice from his Tory cousin, Scott Morrison. The NZ papers are reporting that Bridges has been \u201cmeeting with key members of the Liberal party\u2019s team\u201d, hoping to repeat the strategy that returned Australia\u2019s conservative government to power despite years of public and media opinion predicting a Labor win. To date Bridges\u2019 imitation campaign has been on point. Attacks on a Labour government \u201cyou can\u2019t afford\u201d are the precise wording of Morrison\u2019s campaign. Stop me if you heard this one before: Bridges is calling himself a \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d but announcing anti-welfare policies, with rhetoric to target \u201cgangs\u201d. National\u2019s negative attack ads on Ardern have already started. Surely it is only a matter of time before Bridges is sporting a cap and making sure to spill beer on his balls at a sporting event. \u201cHow good\u201d is Bridges feeling? \u201cVery upbeat\u201d, apparently. Watching the polls, New Zealand commentators are right to suggest that Ardern\u2019s government cannot afford to be complacent \u2013 especially with National retaining a lead over Labour in its party-wide vote. But to suggest a repetition of the heavily spruiked Morrison miracle is likely to deliver Bridges victory is to ignore the fundamental truths that underpin trans-Tasman relations: almost identical flag, similar settler-colonial past, some English spoken \u2026 but different cultures. Different countries. New Zealand, for one, has no Clive Palmer, spending $60m on an omnipresent, all-media vanity campaign that turned out not to succeed in getting elected as much it helped keep Labor out of power. The primary vote of the Liberal/National Coalition actually decreased in the last Australian election; the local preferential voting system means it\u2019s not so much that the most popular candidate wins, but the least unpopular prevails. Assistance from billionaires to reinforce conservative messaging while running candidates that deliver the conservatives preferences isn\u2019t so easy in New Zealand. For a start, New Zealand has had a \u201cmixed member proportional\u201d (MMP) representation system since 1996 where preferences do not factor. Second, New Zealand\u2019s is a non-compulsory voteg, where \u201cget out the vote\u201d strategies are needed to actively motivate people into the ballot boxes, as opposed to Australia where compulsory voting \u2013 for all its benefits \u2013 means negative campaigning influences actual voter choice, rather than poll attendance. But crucially, too, New Zealand\u2019s a country that\u2019s wisely imposed election campaign spending caps. A law prevents an election spend by the parties in excess of NZ$3,605m. For a Palmer to exert comparative influence, New Zealand would need to register 20 parties \u2013 which may, indeed, look dodgy. And while New Zealanders may not believe their truth-in-advertising standards are so strictly enforced in political campaigning, unlike Australia, it actually has them. It\u2019s not quite as easy to spread false rumours of a made-up death tax in a place where already National\u2019s attack ads are provoking a flurry of consumer complaints. What seems to be Bridges\u2019 gambit is that the niche social media targeting that the Liberals, Australia\u2019s hard right One Nation party and Palmer used to such effect might assist undercutting the vote of Ardern\u2019s coalition partner, Winston Peters\u2019 populist New Zealand First. If either New Zealand First or Labour\u2019s other coalition partner, the local Greens drop their primary vote beneath 5%, they\u2019re out of parliament. Enough of an effect on the balance of power within that coalition could, perhaps, clinch Bridges victory. Even so, Ardern is a candidate both with the power of incumbency and an empathetic, sunny, personally popular brand that Australian Labor\u2019s Bill Shorten never had. \u201cIt\u2019s the Jacinda New Zealand can\u2019t afford\u201d as a slogan doesn\u2019t make sense \u2013 especially not when Ardern\u2019s government is going into the election with a surplus. In Australia Labor may have consistently polled a higher two-party-preferred vote but Shorten\u2019s polling as preferred prime minister always struggled, although was higher than Bridges. There\u2019s an additional factor that may, indeed, negate the effect of Bridge\u2019s borrowed thinking. While there was a campaign on Facebook about a death tax that didn\u2019t exist, Morrison promised tax cuts to revive a flailing economy. Those cuts were passed, the treasury\u2019s taken a hit, the Australian economy has not revived, retail spending is at its lowest rate since the last recession, wages remain stagnant. New Zealand voters may be wise enough to look across the Tasman, evaluate the National leader\u2019s Morrison fandom, and consider if they really want to vote for what\u2019s befallen Australia since.
