They weren't the most melodious but, at a push, they sounded like carol singers. But when a householder opened the door to the merry band of nine men and women, she was shocked to discover that they were police officers carrying out a drugs raid. Beneath their tail coats and cloaks were stab-proof vests and two women officers hid canisters of CS spray in their muffs. Their friendly-looking hound was a sniffer dog. PC David Harrison, who went on the raid in Weymouth, Dorset, said it was tricky to get close to the house without being spotted. \"So we came up with the idea of dressing up as carol singers as nobody would be suspicious given the time of year.\" They borrowed the costumes from a local amateur dramatics society and spent five minutes rehearsing We Wish You A Merry Christmas, then went into action. PC Harrison said: \"None of us had particularly good voices but we were persistent. It wasn't until the third verse that the door opened. \"The woman who answered said she would give us a pound to go away and that was when we informed her we were the police and went straight in.\" Two people were arrested and released on bail while substances found were examined. Dorset police are imaginative in undercover operations - in the summer male officers donned skimpy trunks to patrol a troublesome stretch of beach."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
