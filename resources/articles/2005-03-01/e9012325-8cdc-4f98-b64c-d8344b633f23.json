The Croatian reached the fourth round here after winning 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 to underline his credentials as the top 20's most improved player and all that after finding the 6ft 3in French Davis Cup player Michael Llodra squeezed into the 3ft by 1ft space where his belongings used to be. \"I was shocked,\" said Ljubicic. \"I mean really shocked. I didn't know what to say. I didn't know whether to laugh or, you know, look at people around me. I mean obviously everybody knew because it takes time to get in.\" The Frenchman explained his bizarre contortion by saying: \"I'm trying to get positive energy from you - you're winning a lot of matches this year.\" Exhibitionism has been a recurring theme with Llodra. He previously flaunted his assets after taking the doubles title in Majorca and then again after winning the Australian Open doubles with Fabrice Santoro when both players stripped down to their pants, hurling articles of clothing into the crowd. \"I mean he's a weird guy,\" said Ljubicic. \"It's not easy to get in that locker, I'm telling you. Now when I'm opening it, I'm opening it really slowly.\" Andy Roddick had an unpleasant surprise, too. The wrist he sprained while losing here on Friday - retiring against the impressive Spaniard Fernando Verdasco - will be in a cast for a week. His situation does not augur well for the arduous clay-court sequence of the season which begins next week. It also underlined the opportunity to take over Roddick's No3 ranking which was missed by Marat Safin after a slipshod defeat to Dominik Hrbaty on Sunday. \"Who cares?\" Safin said with characteristically cavalier disregard. In the women's competition, the Williams sisters' fitness seems to have taken an upturn. Serena retired from her last tournament in Dubai, where Venus looked even more bandaged and broken than her younger sister. But yesterday there were few signs of further arm problems as Serena overcame Shahar Peer, a 17-year-old Israeli, 6-3, 6-3, and no signs of a painful abdomen or strained wrists as Venus zipped down 116mph serves during an encouraging 6-2, 6-0 victory over Colombia's Fabiola Zuluaga. Yet it was hard to believe Serena, the defending champion, was playing in her home state. She took the first five games to a subdued reaction but when Peer, who was raised on the West Bank, won three in a row, pro-Israeli cheers swelled dramatically. Eventually the disparity in support became almost embarrassing, with cheering for Serena errors and once for a lucky net- cord by Peer. \"You know, I'm ignorant to the whole West Bank settlement of Israel - I'm American,\" Serena said before the match. \"I'll have to look more into that.\" A learning curve of sorts has already begun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
