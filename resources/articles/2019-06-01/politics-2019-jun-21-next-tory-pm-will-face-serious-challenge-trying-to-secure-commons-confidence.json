Several MPs told the Guardian they had \u201chuge concerns\u201d about whether Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt would be able to avoid an autumn election, given the Conservatives could lose another MP in an imminent byelection forced by the recall of Chris Davies. The loss would give the Tories a working majority of three, and at least two MPs, Ken Clarke and Dominic Grieve, have said they would vote against their party if necessary in a confidence vote in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit. The Guardian understands that Hunt raised concerns about the Tories\u2019 shrinking majority in a private hustings with Conservative councillors on Friday, suggesting it would make it almost impossible for any prime minister to pursue no deal. Davies was forced out on Friday by a recall petition following a conviction for expenses fraud, triggering a byelection in Brecon and Radnorshire, which he intends to fight as the Tory candidate. The seat, which the Liberal Democrats have high hopes of winning, could be one of the most significant byelection fights in recent history. Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party also intends to contest the seat. A majority of three would put the Conservatives perilously close to losing any majority. One frontbencher said they were particularly concerned because two anonymous Conservative MPs had apparently been so angered by the state of the party that they spoilt their ballot papers in the fourth round of the leadership vote. A new prime minister would also be expected to pass a Queen\u2019s speech, an autumn budget and agree a new confidence-and-supply agreement with the Democratic Unionist party once a new parliament is called. \u201cOf course, there are huge concerns,\u201d one former Tory minister said. \u201cThe DUP will probably want another \u00a31bn and will probably insist on \u201cno backstop\u201d [in the Brexit deal] as a condition of any continuing relationship.\u201d They added that if Johnson won on the back of support from the the European Research Group of hard-Brexit Tories, the party could lose the backing of pro-Europeans MPs, such as Dominic Grieve, Antoinette Sandbach and Philip Lee. However, the former minister said they believed the situation would not apply uniquely to Johnson, and that either candidate would need to face the ballot box imminently. \u201cAny way you look at it, you can\u2019t avoid an election soon. And I fear Jeremy would lose one.\u201d Others in the party who are sceptical of a Johnson premiership believe it would be better for the frontrunner to have the constraints of a small majority. \u201cIn my view, the smaller the better,\u201d one minister said. \u201cAt some point it is clear you will need an election or a referendum to settle it.\u201d The Lib Dem leadership contender Ed Davey has told Johnson he could immediately find himself without a majority as prime minister, even if the DUP continued to prop up the Conservatives. The tense mood in the Conservatives was underlined when Sandbach, a supporter of Rory Stewart\u2019s campaign, tweeted text messages she received from a fellow Tory MP telling her to leave the party. Sandbach told the BBC she had received the message after the MP had been \u201ctrawling\u201d through a defunct WhatsApp group and found messages from her that he deemed objectionable. Julian Smith, the chief whip, has promised to investigate. \u201cI\u2019m certain there were dark ops during the leadership election and you have to wonder why somebody was going through an old group that hadn\u2019t been active for many, many, many months,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the dark ops we have been hearing about don\u2019t cast a good light on politicians and they don\u2019t cast a good light on politics.\u201d Several moderate Tory MPs believe Johnson may struggle to hold together his coalition of supporters, which range from moderates, such as Matt Hancock and Robert Buckland, to the \u201cspartans\u201d of fervent Eurosceptics who have blocked Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. One sceptical MP who saw Johnson in the last days of the campaign for MPs\u2019 votes said he told them he believed the chances of no deal were \u201cvanishingly small\u201d. Yet members of the ERG, including MPs such as Steve Baker and Mark Francois, claimed to have been told Johnson was willing to rip up the entire withdrawal agreement. Hunt\u2019s team believes its chances lie in skewering Johnson on the detail of his plan for exiting by 31 October, with one source saying the campaign team had \u201cenjoyed Mark Carney\u2019s take down of Boris\u2019s no-deal tariffs \u2018plan\u2019 this morning on the Today programme\u201d. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 show, the Bank of England governor rejected claims by Johnson that a rule he had described as \u201cGatt 24\u201d \u2013 article 24 of the World Trade Organisation\u2019s general agreement on tariffs and trade \u2013 would allow existing tariff arrangements to apply between a no-deal Brexit and a new agreement being reached with Brussels. \u201cGatt applies if you have an agreement, not if you have decided not to have an agreement or have been unable to come to an agreement,\u201d Carney said. Both Johnson and Hunt attended the Local Government Association hustings on Friday morning, but left without saying anything. The pair will attend the first official Conservative leadership hustings in Birmingham on Saturday, hosted by the presenter Iain Dale, followed by 15 more events over the next four weeks, after which party members will vote."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
