The pair have already been sniping at one another regarding the amount of money that will be available to strengthen the squad during the close season. O'Leary was also angered after Ellis announced last week that qualifying for the Champions League was the minimum requirement next season. Ellis followed that up by claiming the Uefa Cup was not a lucrative competition and that playing in it could even result in the club losing money. Now the 80-year-old Ellis appears to have had a change of heart and, instead of congratulating O'Leary and his players on climbing 10 places to finish sixth, has totted up the cost of not qualifying for the Uefa Cup. \"With the new format for the Uefa Cup, once you get through the first round it becomes a league with eight groups of five,\" Ellis said. \"You then have home and away matches, and there could have been \u00a37m or \u00a38m in it for us. \"But the fact is though that I only wanted us to be in Europe for the fans - nothing else. We've lost money but my thoughts are with them.\" O'Leary has already spent \u00a33m on Milan's Danish international defender Martin Laursen. The 26-year-old has agreed personal terms and Villa officials travelled to Denmark yesterday to complete the deal. Birmingham City's manager Steve Bruce, meanwhile, has questioned the wisdom of the Republic Of Ireland playing four internationals in 10 days at the end of the season. Bruce, who has a vested interest with Ireland's captain Kenny Cunningham and striker Clinton Morrison part of the squad, said: \"I can't see the point of international friendlies at that time unless you are building up for a European Championship or a World Cup. The players deserve a break.\" Chelsea's hopes of signing Fernando Morientes appear to be receding, with the striker showing more interest in an offer from Juventus. The Spain international is available from Real Madrid after a season on loan at Monaco. Chelsea have made an approach for Morientes, who played a significant role in knocking them out of the Champions League semi-finals. However, the 28-year-old seems to have decided to join Juventus, where the Monaco coach Didier Deschamps is widely expected to move during the summer. Morientes has said a deal with an unnamed club is \"90% done\", adding: \"I really like the idea of joining that club but by the time the contract is sealed and signed it might take a little while and I might have to go back to Real Madrid at the end of the season.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
