In a double blow to the BBC's ambition to re-establish itself as a significant broadcaster of major football events, ITV has retained rights to the Tuesday night games. Sky will show the Wednesday night games live and also broadcast those Tuesday night games which are not being shown on ITV1 or ITV2. Sky and ITV are understood to have agreed jointly to pay around \u00a384meach year to screen live games and highlights from 2003-2006. The price agreed is a significant increase on the \u00a360m paid by ITV for its current contract and will give clubs and players hope that football's lucrative relationship with television is not facing the premature end that many predict. BSkyB, chaired by Rupert Murdoch, now has exclusive rights to the Premiership, the Football League and the Champions League. Executives at Sky believe that by demonstrating their continued commitment to top-flight football they will be able to persuade the Premiership clubs to re-award the rights when the contract comes up for renewal in 2005. The BBC director general Greg Dyke, a former Manchester United director, had been determined to swipe the rights from under the noses of his arch rivals. He wants to re-establish the reputation of the corporation's sports coverage after losing Premiership highlights to ITV and facing criticism for filling Grandstand with minority sports. It is understood that the BBC outbid both BSkyB and ITV by several millions of pounds in an effort to placate sponsors who would not have been able to show their logos on the channel because of its public service commitments. Sources estimate the BBC was ready to pay around \u00a350m, while ITV offered \u00a340m and Sky \u00a344m. A BBC spokesman played down the significance of the loss. \"We made it clear throughout the bidding process that we were interested in the rights but not at any price. We did not feel we could justify the licence fee-payers income by bidding any higher.\" ITV has broadcast the Champions League since the competition was created 10 years ago and lured a record 19m viewers for Manchester United's final victory over Bayern Munich in 1999. Brian Barwick, ITV's controller of sport, said: \"To have exclusive terrestrial rights to the world's premier club competition for another three years underlines ITV's continuing commitment to top-class sport.\" Sky will show 14 matches live from each week of the group stages with viewers able to select their live game - or switch between games - by using Sky digital's interactive service. The final will be shown live on Sky and ITV. Vic Wakeling, managing director of Sky Sports, said: \"As fans ourselves we are excited at the prospect of being involved in this new era of Champions League coverage.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
