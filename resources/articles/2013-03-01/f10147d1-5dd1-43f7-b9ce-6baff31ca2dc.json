Despite beating Saints in four Grand Finals between 2007 and 2011, the Rhinos had not won at their old home of Knowsley Road since 2008 and were humiliated on their only previous visit to Langtree Park last March to provoke a surreal controversy over a team decision to dye their hair red to raise funds for Comic Relief. So this was a hugely satisfying result for the champions in all sorts of ways, as they bounced back from the draining disappointment of last Friday's defeat against Melbourne to tackle Saints out of the contest and then strike clinically at the other end. But shutting out this St Helens team is not the challenge it has been in the past. Astonishingly for such a well-resourced club they appear to have started the season without an established half-back combination and have now taken a single point from three home matches. The locals are not impressed. Ryan Hall scored two tries for Leeds and provided the final pass for the third for Kylie Leuluai, with Kevin Sinfield kicking four goals \u2013 although the captain's inability to convert Hall's first try from the touchline brought to an end a run of 41 consecutive successful kicks stretching back to the play-offs last September. \"We had a fair amount of adversity to overcome,\" said the Leeds coach, Brian McDermott, referring to the picturesque route through Sowerby Bridge that the team were forced to take by the closure of the M62 across the Pennines. They arrived in plenty of time butthe van carrying their kit and tackle shields was stuck on the motorway, and until it arrived five minutes before the kick-off, their big men were struggling to squeeze into shirts normally worn by the under-19 academy players. \"There was a lot of energy went into that Melbourne game, physical as well as emotional, so it was always going to be a question of could we get up again,\" McDermott added. It was obvious from the start that they had, as Sinfield kicked them ahead with a second-minute penalty. Saints did score the first try when Jonny Lomax took Jon Wilkin's pass and backed himself to beat the cover to touch down in the corner. But that was a rare moment of fluency as the new half-back pairing of Wilkin and Gary Wheeler struggled to convince. Sinfield brought Leeds level midway through the half with his second penalty, and the Rhinos then hit the front with the game's first moment of real class, the captain galloping clear from 30 metres out and combining with Danny McGuire for Hall to touch down in the left corner. For the remaining 13 minutes of the first half, and the first 20 of the second, Leeds spent long periods defending their line. B ut they protected their 8-4 lead without many alarms, and counter-attacked to stretch out of sight. Mark Percival, an 18-year-old debutant who was the brightest St Helens spark throughout, laid on two late consolation tries for Francis Meli but they came far too late to threaten the Rhinos.
