Lloyd's is adding up the potential bill from Katrina after receiving returns from the 62 member syndicates by Monday night's deadline. S&amp;P has already put the market on its \"CreditWatch Negative\", which could lead to a downgrade of its A rating. Yesterday it admitted that it was concerned about certain, unnamed syndicates. \"While we do not expect the solvency of the market to be impaired, losses will not be evenly spread,\" said Matthew Day, a credit analyst at S&amp;P. \"As a result, the continuity prospects of some syndicates may be adversely affected.\" S&amp;P believes some syndicates could be exposed to \"severe losses\". The syndicates facing the greatest financial difficulty are those underwriting energy businesses and those which receive their income in US dollars, S&amp;P said. S&amp;P's analysis noted that a \"handful\" of exposed syndicates had made early forecasts of possible losses. But it noted that the agency \"remains sceptical about the reliability of some of these numbers until a more accurate industry loss is calculated\". The agency has put Lloyd's on its ratings watch because of the \"uncertainty of the scale of the impact of Hurricane Katrina on Lloyd's\". The market has not been able to discuss any potential losses with rating agencies because it has not yet produced any estimates for the overall market. S&amp;P is basing its analysis on current estimates for the losses faced by the industry, which range from $25bn (\u00a313bn) to $50bn - a record-breaking figure. The agency noted that the divergence indicated \"that there is still a very high degree of uncertainty as to the quantum of the losses\". The insurer Kiln reiterated yesterday that it expected to incur a loss of \u00a330m-\u00a335m as a result of the hurricane. Kiln joined its rivals in predicting that the cost of insurance would rise as a result."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
