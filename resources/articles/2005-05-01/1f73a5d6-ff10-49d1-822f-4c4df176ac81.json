Across the centre circle at kick-off will stand Clarence Seedorf, an opponent weighed down by medals won over a decade in three countries. \"I have not won a thing, not even played in a cup final,\" admitted Alonso. \"But this would be some way to start.\" Success is long overdue for the 23-year-old Spaniard and, should he emerge as the dominant midfield force tonight, tangible reward beckons. A near-miss with Real Sociedad in La Liga, pipped at the last by Real Madrid, is as close as he has come in his professional career. Retreat into his youth and there was even disappointment as a nine-year-old with his village side Antiguoko in an international tournament in Sweden. Reality suggests his time is drawing close. His pinpoint passing, alongside Steven Gerrard's effervescence at the heart of Liverpool's midfield, has been instrumental in propelling Rafael Ben\u00edtez's side to the final. So unflustered is he in possession that his class puts most to shame. Around him John Arne Riise and Luis Garc\u00eda can buzz with menace, though it is in his partnership with Gerrard that they can dictate. \"Our qualities seem to combine well,\" said Alonso, in whom Ben\u00edtez first expressed an interest when it appeared Liverpool might lose Gerrard to Chelsea last summer. The manager eventually paid \u00a310.7m to bring the two together. \"Stevie is such a strong player and such a quick, powerful runner. When he charges forward I try and hold things together a bit more. My qualities are slightly different but that is what you need in a partnership. \"We are as good as any pair we have encountered in the Champions League. We have not been outshone by anybody. Midfield is a key area for any team and there are some outstanding combinations around, like Andrea Pirlo and Kaka, or Claude Makelele and Frank Lampard. But Stevie and I are up there with the best. I don't know what he will do next season but winning the Champions League might help us keep him. It would surely be easier for him to decide he should stay. I hope it works out, because I like playing with great players and that is how I would describe Stevie.\" Liverpool were denied their pairing in the semi- final second leg, a soft booking at Stamford Bridge for an apparent foul on Eidur Gudjohnsen condemning Alonso to the sidelines. \"It was shattering to be ruled out because I knew how much would be riding on the second game,\" he said. \"There were tears when I sat down in the dressing room afterwards. I couldn't hold them back, but hearing my team-mates, one after another, say, 'Don't worry, Xabi. We will win it for you,' that was special. \"I've never experienced anything like the noise in that second leg. As I sat there, I found myself joining in. I couldn't help it. When the final whistle went I just had to get on to the pitch. I tried to climb over the front of the press box but there was no way through all the fans in the seats below. So I sprinted down the stairs and out through the players' tunnel. I wanted to share the moment with my team-mates, to say thank you because they had promised me a Champions League final. They delivered for me; I owe them for that.\" His team-mates will need his calm presence tonight if they are to suppress Pirlo, Seedorf and Gennaro Gattuso. Plans have been hatched around pace, with the Spain international at their hub, and Liverpool will share their midfielder's belief. \"I knew all about the tradition which surrounds this club when I signed,\" he added. \"To be walking out in a final 20 years on from their last appearance is something to savour. It will be great to be part of Liverpool's history.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
