Addeybb (3.00) tends to be pigeon-holed as a mudlark but it may be worth giving him the chance to prove he has become a top-class competitor in the Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes. It was only a Listed race that he won over this course and distance last summer but there was some top-class form represented by the three that followed him home. The fitting of cheekpieces since that day has helped him and he won nearly \u00a31m in prize money in Australia during the spring. Japan looks like the better horse but this might not be a bad time to take him on, as he makes his reappearance over a trip that might be short of his optimum by now. He was getting the generous three-year-old allowance when he achieved so much last summer. Perhaps William Haggas\u2019s globetrotter can get the better of him at 5-1 or so. 1.15 Jim Crowley made an amazing start to Ascot week with three Tuesday winners and he could be aboard the right one here in Maydanny, impressive on his handicap debut at Yarmouth a fortnight ago. A half-brother to the Group Two winner Elarqam, he should have more to offer. On the limited evidence available, his far-side draw could be a problem but in the past it has not paid to be adamant about such things after a single day\u2019s action. 1.50 After Mogul\u2019s flop on Tuesday, this is a big chance for Russian Emperor to put himself forward as a Derby contender for Aidan O\u2019Brien. A really powerful finisher on rain-softened ground in March, he was caught out by a quicker surface and a modest pace at Leopardstown eight days ago. These conditions will put more emphasis on his stamina and he can run down the pacey Juan Elcano. 2.25 It\u2019s 24 years since Sir Mark Prescott had a Royal Ascot winner but Bodyline gives him a big chance. The colt\u2019s profile is familiar to fans of the trainer, as he is bred for middle-distances but did not actually try them until a reasonable handicap mark had been achieved. His running-on second at Yarmouth a fortnight ago looked close to the ideal prep-run. 3.35 He was flying too high when tried in a Group One at this meeting last year but Bell Rock looked a lot more like the finished article when landing his first handicap at Newmarket 10 days ago. With just a 5lb penalty and Oisin Murphy aboard, another good showing seems on the cards. 4.10 Aidan O\u2019Brien can win the Windsor Castle for just the second time with Chief Little Hawk, who looked a thorough professional when he bounced out of the stalls and made all on his debut last week. The forecast rain could be a problem for Wesley Ward\u2019s runners. 4.40 A full brother to the impressive St Leger winner Logician, Collide also looks like excelling at marathon trips. This race seems made for him and he is well in under a penalty for beating Land Of Oz, who ran well for a long way here on Tuesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
