Returning to Tallahassee after visiting a coronavirus testing site in Miami and issuing a regional stay-at-home order for the state\u2019s four southernmost counties, he was preparing notes for an upcoming press conference and doubtless thinking about the birth of his third child. The beaches below him were not packed, as in the enduring images that will come to epitomize his lethargic response to the pandemic, but there were enough people milling about to alarm the elected leader of the only one of the \u201chotspot\u201d states \u2013 those with Covid-19 cases at that stage in excess of 5,000 \u2013 not to have imposed blanket stay-at-home restrictions. \u201cWere there people out there? Damn right there were,\u201d DeSantis said of his observations at a press briefing on Tuesday afternoon, one day after his Miami visit. \u201cNo matter what you do, you\u2019re going to have a class of folks who just do whatever the hell they want to. Not everyone believes they need to govern themselves accordingly.\u201d The scenes on the beaches had clearly resonated with the governor. On Wednesday, before another 24 hours had passed, DeSantis finally issued the statewide shelter-in-place order for Florida\u2019s population of 21 million \u2013 one in five of whom are older than 65 \u2013 that health officials, scientists and political opponents had been pleading with him to sign for more than two weeks. During that time, as the number of cases and fatalities grew, Florida\u2019s beaches remained open, thousands flocked to church services (in defiance of local rules) and carefree seniors in the country\u2019s fastest-growing retirement hub, The Villages, did what they always do: play golf. Offshore, cruise ships stricken with dead or infected crew and passengers waited, unsure if they would be allowed to dock. \u2018DeSantis took a leaf from the Trump playbook\u2019 Meanwhile, DeSantis appeared to fiddle while Florida burned. He pressed ahead with his patchwork management of the crisis: a partial closure in some areas, interstate roadblocks to deter visitors, asking bars and restaurants to shutter, but mostly allowing cities and counties to set their own rules. Even after issuing Monday\u2019s unified order affecting Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe counties, the governor conceded it contained little that was new. \u201cI just came in and made them all one unit so everyone was on the same page,\u201d he said. To nobody\u2019s surprise, DeSantis was taking a leaf straight from the Trump playbook by prioritizing the economy, and listening to advice from the Florida chamber of commerce, Associated Industries of Florida and the state\u2019s restaurant and lodging association over that of public health officials warning of a coming disease tsunami, according to the Tampa Bay Times. It was all, in the words of Oscar Braynon, a state senator from Miami Gardens, \u201cthe dumbest shit I have heard in a long time\u201d. That Florida\u2019s governor has been in lockstep with the messaging and posturing from the White House at every step of the pandemic, up to and including this week\u2019s abrupt volte-face, was a given, at least to those who have followed the former US congressman\u2019s career in Tallahassee. DeSantis \u2013 hailed from the Rose Garden lectern as \u201ca great governor who knows exactly what he is doing\u201d \u2013 consults with Trump regularly and the two share a similar ideology. As Trump frequently and controversially called Covid-19 the \u201cChinese virus\u201d, DeSantis was also castigating outsiders, blaming New Yorkers for \u201cseeding\u201d the spread in Florida and dispatching the national guard to airports to intercept them. When the president mooted plans to classify counties by risk level, then last weekend floated the idea of a quarantine for New York, DeSantis gave his full support. And as the pressure built this week for a statewide stay-at-home edict, DeSantis admitted he would be taking his orders directly from Washington DC. \u201cWhatever they\u2019re recommending we\u2019ll go ahead and do that,\u201d he said at the Tuesday press briefing. \u201cIf any of those taskforce folks tell me we should do X, Y or Z, then of course we\u2019re going to consider, but nobody has said that to me thus far.\u201d \u2018He put us in a dangerous situation\u2019 The instruction duly came on Wednesday morning, in the form of an appearance on NBC\u2019s Today program by Jerome Adams, the US surgeon general. Asked about DeSantis\u2019s prevarication, Adams responded by quoting Trump\u2019s extension of social distancing measures the night before: \u201cMy advice to America would be that these guidelines are a national stay-at-home order.\u201d The message was unmistakable. Trump and DeSantis spoke again by phone later on Wednesday morning, and by mid-afternoon, with the state\u2019s coronavirus death toll ticking above 100 for the first time, Florida executive order 20-91 was published. DeSantis said on Thursday on Fox News that the U-turn \u201cwas the right thing to do\u201d because of the Trump extension. \u201cWe have a governor who does not believe he serves the people of Florida but rather kowtows to the president of the United States,\u201d Donna Shalala, a congressional representative for Miami who was the US secretary of health during Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, told reporters on Thursday morning. The delay in publishing the order, she added, had been a critical miscalculation. \u201cHe hesitated and hesitated and hesitated. He has put us in a dangerous situation. Numerous people will die because our governor hesitated,\u201d she said. The question now is what consequence the order will have, and whether it has come too late to significantly alter experts\u2019 predictions of a spike in deaths in Florida. On Thursday the University of Washington\u2019s institute for health was still predicting cases in the state would crest in early May, but increased its projected peak daily death toll from 136 to 175, a rate that would lead to about 7,000 deaths by mid-June. \u201cWe are trying to plan for a tsunami on the horizon that everybody is hoping is going to miss our island but is bearing straight down on us,\u201d said Dr Kayser Enneking, professor of anesthesiology at the University of Florida\u2019s department of medicine. \u201cThe response we\u2019ve seen from the state and federal governments has been based not on science but the gut of our leaders. The number of cases in Florida is on the exponential rise, but the lack of testing has impacted our ability to predict where we are in this crisis.\u201d State was \u2018woefully underprepared\u2019 The picture is also muddled over the medical supplies and equipment Florida says it will need. Last Sunday, Trump insisted that the state\u2019s wishlist, including 5,000 ventilators, half a million each of gloves and gowns, and 2m N95 face masks, had been met from federal supplies. \u201cFlorida has been taken care of,\u201d the president promised. \u201cI looked, they\u2019re very aggressive in trying to get things done and they\u2019re doing a very good job.\u201d But by the following afternoon Jared Moskowitz, appointed by DeSantis as Florida\u2019s director of emergency management last year, had resorted to Twitter, frustrated by failed efforts to bring more masks to the state and lamenting a lack of a federal allocation system. \u201cIt feels like a Ponzi scheme,\u201d he wrote, referring to the third-party distribution scheme for equipment manufactured by 3M. \u201cDifferent distributors represented by brokers selling the same lot of masks bidding against each other. I\u2019m chasing ghosts here.\u201d As for testing, Jane Castor, the mayor of Tampa, told Slate she believed the state was \u201cwoefully underprepared\u201d. \u201cIn Hillsborough county, we received just 900 collection kits over a week ago. We went through those in two days. We just received another thousand, and we\u2019ll get through those in two days as well,\u201d she said. She was, however, reluctant to place the blame solely on DeSantis: \u201cIt\u2019s the first time this governor\u2019s been through it. What a hell of a test this is.\u201d George Moraitis, chair of Broward county\u2019s Republican party, was even more generous. \u201cGovernor DeSantis is under the microscope but he\u2019s excelling,\u201d he wrote in a Sun-Sentinel op-ed. \u201cHe is leading Florida through the Covid-19 outbreak with measured, informed and effective actions to protect both the health and the fundamental rights of all Floridians.\u201d Evan Jenne, co-leader elect of Florida\u2019s House Democrats, told the Guardian that further down the line he would call for a legislative select committee to evaluate the actions of DeSantis and his administration throughout the crisis. \u201cWe need to know what went right and what went wrong. I have a feeling that both of those will be long lists,\u201d he said. DeSantis\u2019s decree, however, will appear firmly in the second category, in Jenne\u2019s view, not least because it exempts churches and places of worship. \u201cIt\u2019s an executive order with holes big enough you could drive an 18-wheeler through it. Mass meetings of worshipping folks are perfectly fine, and that\u2019s not going to help,\u201d he said. \u201cAt no point in our nation\u2019s history has human sacrifice ever been an acceptable form of worship and you\u2019re potentially going to kill someone, if not put them through respiratory hell. It\u2019s not strict enough in any way, shape or form.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
