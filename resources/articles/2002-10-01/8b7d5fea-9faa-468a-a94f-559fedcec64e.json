Although the show is officially about the 'Art' and 'Craft' of the late Italian maestro, it's really a tribute to the follies and triumphs of the foppish dresser. Five years after Versace's death, it looks like the dandy is making a comeback. Flicking through the autumn/winter catalogues and fashion magazines, I note that the dominant look is Thin White Duke era David Bowie meets New York pimp. It's not just Hello! magazine regulars who will be flaunting themselves over the coming months: big, bold clothes are back. Personally, I'm not sure if I can carry off the ghetto-fabulous look. For me, autumn means browns, greys, navy blues and the occasional bright scarf. But even if you can't afford to take sartorial risks, you can afford the prices. At the Top Man autumn/winter 2002 launch a couple of months ago, design director Gordon Richardson teamed Harrington jackets and pastel knitwear, ski-jackets and modish trousers. As the models strode down the runway, they showed that affordable youth fashion isn't just about baggy denim and tight T-shirts. By adding a twist to classic looks and fabrics, Top Man offered a collection fit for teenagers and thirtysomethings. Visit Paul Smith, the reliable choice for any gent who wants to look a bit different, if you've got more disposable cash. He has a great brown and beige houndstooth coat (\u00a3300) with matching jacket (\u00a3325), among other good buys. Elsewhere in the shops there are plenty of retro double-breasted jackets, fur-lined collars, even white leather gloves (Budd, \u00a365), and other raffish items. Of course, the high-street-dandy look originated on the catwalks, so if you want (and can afford) the real McCoy, Alexander McQueen could be your man. The glamorous designer is about to launch his bespoke menswear range and will open a Bond Street store next year. Expect fabulous cuts, hand finishing and silk satin linings. It sounds fantastic, but at \u00a36,000 per suit, I'm going to take my chances at Top Man if I fancy adding a dash of colour to my wardrobe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
