The Manchester City midfielder has been charged with improper conduct and/or bringing his sport into disrepute for an incident in which he lowered his shorts after being targeted for verbal abuse in Saturday's drawn game. He has until 6pm today to respond, and an FA disciplinary commission will hear the case on Tuesday. Merseyside police have already confirmed that they will not be taking action. The charge is similar to the one brought against Gary Neville in January, when he ran 40 yards to taunt Liverpool fans following Manchester United's last-minute winner. He was fined \u00a35,000. Stuart Pearce, who sent Barton to anger-management classes after he punched a 15-year-old Everton fan in Bangkok 14 months ago, believes the matter should have been dismissed as much of Saturday's abuse was in reference to Barton's half-brother Michael, who was imprisoned for his part in the racist murder of Anthony Walker, a Liverpool student. Gary Breen will not be suspended for his sending-off at Cardiff after his appeal was upheld by the FA. The central defender was dismissed for appearing to elbow Steve Thompson in Wolves' 4-0 defeat but the FA reviewed footage and received a statement from Thompson, who said the action was accidental."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
