The scramble to buy back stock was triggered by blue chip broker Cazenove, which took the bold step of reiterating its outperform recommendation on the eve of the update. Traders said the short sellers had taken the view that Cazenove would not have issued the note if it thought this morning's announcement would disappoint. Given the fact that the company has recently been buying back stock - something it would not do if a profits warning were on the cards - that seems a fair bet. Moreover, analysts note that the last time Man Group issued a trading update (in July) short sellers were left nursing burnt fingers after a reassuring statement triggered an 8% rally. Man Group ended the day 34p higher at \u00a312.45. In the wider market, leading shares closed higher, lifted by a strong showing from the mining sector. BHP Billiton gained 29p to 584.5p while Rio Tinto climbed 52p to \u00a314.72 and Anglo American advanced 37p to \u00a313.11 as the price of copper, iron ore and coal all pushed higher. The final scores showed the FTSE 100 up 26.1 points at 4567.3. The FTSE 250 index moved up 6.9 points to 6233.7, while the FTSE Small Cap index finished unchanged at 2543.1. Market turnover remained lacklustre with about 2.5bn shares changing hands. In the bond market, gilts edged lower as investors took profits. The benchmark 10-year gilt closed at 101.480, yielding 4.811%. Back among the blue chips Cable &amp; Wireless took the FTSE 100's wooden spoon. Its shares fell 3.25p to 96.5p - a low for the year - unsettled by talk that it is the company responsible for the predatory pricing that has triggered the recent profits warnings from Thus , up 0.75p to 13.75p, and Colt Telecom , off 1.25p to 41p. Given that C&amp;W wrote down the value of its UK network to \u00a3500m, analysts said they would not be surprised if C&amp;W had been the aggressor. Medical devices group Smith &amp; Nephew , 1.5p lighter at 489p, was also under pressure, unsettled by rumours that the company had hinted during briefings in the City last week that it will be a struggle to post earnings of 21p this year. In the media sector, satellite broadcaster BSkyB eased 7.75p to 478p amid further talk that it had managed to sign up only 15,000 subscribers in its first quarter. On a brighter note, cruise ship operator Carnival added 12p to \u00a327.65p after Deutsche Bank raised its target price to an eyecatching \u00a335. The German broker reckons the current share price does not reflect the likelihood that earnings will double in the next two years and that Carnival will hand back a large chunk of cash to its shareholders. Invensys , the troubled controls and automation group, was the FTSE 250's biggest faller. Its shares shed 1.75p, or 13.5%, to 11.25p after German investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein reiterated its reduce recommendation and slapped a 5p target price on the stock. Dresdner believes a bid for the company is unlikely to materialise given its ongoing operating problems and pension fund deficit. On a more fundamental tack, it believes an earnings recovery is unlikely to emerge next year and there is therefore no reason to hold the stock. Elsewhere, bid speculation was once again swirling around construction group Amec . Its shares gained 6p to 305p, excited first by rumours that US rival Fluor Corporation had offered several institutions in excess of 380p a share for their holdings and by talk that a UK peer is also running the slide rule over the company. Among the small caps, Courts , the heavily indebted furniture group which unleashed another profits warn ing last week, firmed 0.5p to 65p. After the market closed, three directors, including executive chairman Leo McKee, announced the purchase of 50,000 shares at an average price of 65p. Catalyst Media Group closed 0.5p higher at 8.5p, excited by the appearance of value investor Paul Curtis on its share register with a 3% holding. Catalyst shares have been under pressure in recent days due to speculation that it is looking to raise cash at 6p a share to fund the acquisition of a 20% stake in Satellite Information Services, provider of live racing to UK bookmakers. Biofuels Corporation which is building Europe's biggest biodiesel plant on Teesside, improved 5.5p to 105p after a large overhang had been cleared. Finally, Trafficmaster , the traffic information specialist, rallied 2.5p to 83p as David Martell, who stepped down as chief executive after last week's interims, said he had no plans to sell any more stock. \"I am looking forward to seeing my baby grow in the future,\" he said, adding that he had the opportunity to sell all of his holding on Friday, such was the demand from institutions. In the end Mr Martell sold 3m shares through Bridgewell Securities at 82.5p. The entrepreneur plans to use the proceeds to fund his next venture. Some Total for sale BP and Shell, which closed 7p higher at 539p and 1.75p lower at 407.5p respectively, may come under pressure this morning as the City digests a huge share placing in French oil group Total. After close of business yesterday, a number of leading investment banks were asked to bid for the right to place 2.3% of Total which, on last night's closing price of \u20ac170, is worth \u20ac2.5bn (\u00a31.7bn). It was not clear last night who the seller was, though speculation centred on the French government. Total is the world's fourth biggest oil company. With the crude price hitting a record high, traders said they were not surprised someone was looking to sell."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
