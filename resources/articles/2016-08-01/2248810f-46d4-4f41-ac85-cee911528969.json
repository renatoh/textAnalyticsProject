The National Union of Students and almost 60 individual student unions are warning that the planned shake-up of universities outlined in the recent higher education white paper will \u201centrench inequality\u201d rather than eradicate it. In a letter, published in the Guardian, they express concern about the planned introduction of the teaching excellence framework (TEF) which they say will use questionable metrics to assess the quality of teaching at each university and enable institutions to raise tuition fees in line with inflation. \u201cThis will have severe ramifications, entrenching inequality between higher education providers and contradicting the government\u2019s ambitions around widening participation,\u201d the letter states. Some universities in England have already begun telling potential students their fees will go up across the board from next year, the first rise since fees were nearly trebled to \u00a39,000 in 2012. Manchester and Durham are among those already listing annual undergraduate fees as rising to \u00a39,250, following an announcement by higher education minister Jo Johnson that universities meeting expectations under the first year of the new TEF would be able to raise them from September 2017. The students\u2019 letter warns however: \u201cDebt aversion disproportionately affects groups already facing barriers to education: the participation rate increase for the poorest students has stagnated and 18-year-olds from the most disadvantaged backgrounds are 2.4 times less likely to apply.\u201d The government\u2019s stated aim to widen participation at university has taken a hit in recent days. Last Monday there was criticism as the maintenance grant for the most disadvantaged students was scrapped in favour of loans. Then on Wednesday new figures from the Department for Education revealed the percentage of state-educated pupils going on to universities and colleges in 2013/14 fell to 62% from 66% in the previous year following the hike in tuition fees to \u00a39,000. Sorana Vieru, NUS vice-president, said: \u201cWith fees trebled just four years ago, it is unacceptable to argue fees now need to be raised further for students to be sure that their education will be of a high quality. Fundamentally the tuition fees system is broken, and it is deeply worrying if further tinkering and fee rises are needed to ensure it is delivering for students. \u201cStudents\u2019 unions and teaching unions across the sector have highlighted that measuring teaching quality is an extremely complicated task. You simply can\u2019t achieve it through the crude measures proposed for the TEF and the unintended consequences it could lead to are very worrying.\u201d One of the measures which will be used to measure teaching quality as part of the TEF is the annual National Student Survey (NSS), which the NUS has dismissed as \u201ca limited measure of satisfaction, not quality\u201d. The NUS annual conference last year voted to either boycott or sabotage the NSS in a direct challenge to the TEF and tactics are still under discussion. The NUS letter coincides with the publication of the results of the most recent NSS on Wednesday (August 10), which shows overall satisfaction levels at 86%, the same as last year, with 7% dissatisfied, and a further 7% neither satisfied or dissatisfied. The response rate to the 2016 survey was 72 per cent, slightly higher than the previous two years, with 312,000 responses from final-year students from universities across the UK. Johnson said universities were working hard to meet the needs of students, adding: \u201cBut there are still big gaps between institutions, too many of which have seen drops in satisfaction in the last year. \u201cWe want all graduates to leave universities with the skills they need to succeed and that is why by judging universities on students\u2019 experiences as well as academic outcomes through the Teaching Excellence Framework we will put students at the heart of how universities and courses are assessed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
