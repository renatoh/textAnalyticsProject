Hans Rott was a slightly older contemporary of Mahler who died in an asylum at the age of 25, but not without completing a symphony that lay dormant until its rediscovery 1989. Hearing a scherzo in isolation is never the best way to judge a symphony \u2013 it's like being a given a punchline without the joke \u2013 but the 10-minute fragment was enough to pique curiosity. There is a Mahlerian tone to it, which opens with a bracing blast of brass before haring off on a visceral journey of hairpin changes of direction. As Mahler wrote of Rott: \"He and I were like two fruits from the same tree. We would have an infinite amount in common\". It set the scene for Vasily Petrenko to prove himself to be a dynamically individual Mahlerian. He does not stand apart from the work, perfecting its overall shape, but gets right inside, conducting in the moment; if not all the corners were negotiated with precision it still made for an exhilarating ride. Mahler's sardonic appropriation of the Fr\u00e8re Jacques melody can seem banal, but Petrenko instilled it with a dark sense of foreboding. And he was responsive to the work's east European influences \u2013 there were several giddy points at which the RLPO sounded like a giant klezmer band. If it continues in the vein, Liverpool's Mahler cycle could be one of the most appealingly idiosyncratic odysseys of this anniversary year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
