Crass because how can anyone presume to speak for every single person from a minority culture? Wrong because, like many Jews of eastern European origin, I probably feel more English than those who've been here for generations. Now some within our faith argue that perhaps we Jews assimilate a bit too much. I got my love of afternoon tea from my Polish-born gran and my love of English football from my soccer-mad mother screaming for Arsenal - thus demolishing yet another stereotype that we Jews are all Spurs fans. But one thing was always made very clear to me as I grew up - it is being English, and British, that matters, since this is where we found freedom of expression and freedom from persecution. Sure there is still a long way to go before every minority feels as welcome, and as British, as many Jews do. But you know, you could do a bit more of the work yourselves and stop expecting your host community to do it all for you. And no, that doesn't mean giving up your religion, your faith or your beliefs. But a little give and take, what could it hurt? Laura Marcus Leek, Staffs How does Afsaneh Mirfendereski explain the fact that with me being Irish and my best friends being Dutch and Tunisian none of us would want to live anywhere else? As for the comment, \"the second I get off the plane here in the US, I feel integrated\": ask any non-US citizen travelling there how integrated they feel queuing for immigration. Rather like a criminal is how I feel, and I'm not Muslim. Integration should not be expected, but rather worked towards. I feel as British as bangers and mash, and that's not down to geography, but to my beliefs and respect for the British people and their way of life. Damien Kelly London Afsaneh Mirfendereski's ludicrous claims about minorities in Britain would be more persuasive if she displayed less ignorance of the US. Prior to 9/11 the worst atrocities, the Oklahoma bombing and the Unabomber campaign, were carried out by homegrown terrorists. And I somehow hadn't thought of the terrifying urban riots of the late 20th century as signalling satisfaction with their lot on the part of the America's largest minority. And I understand that its oldest minority, the original inhabitants, aren't too thrilled about their fate either. Anthony Ching London Unlike Mirfendereski I, an Indian immigrant, am fortunate to feel fully at home in England. I feel greatly privileged to live here and I'm grateful to countless English colleagues, neighbours, friends and complete strangers for innumerable acts of kindness and of love.
