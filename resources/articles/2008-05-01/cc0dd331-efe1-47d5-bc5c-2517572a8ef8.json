Major Alex Blake, 35, of the Royal Logistic Corps, crashed into a tree during a military training exercise at the Cenes de la Vega resort in the Granada region on Wednesday evening. It is believed the accident happened when he attempted a manoeuvre in the lower areas of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Emergency services could do nothing to save his life, said a civil guard spokesman. The Ministry of Defence described the death as \"tragic\", saying its \"thoughts and sympathies are with the officer's next of kin\".

Martin Hodgson Elton John lends pictures for Tuke exhibitions Elton John is lending 11 paintings for what will be the biggest exhibition of paintings by an artist many consider a neglected Edwardian genius, Henry Scott Tuke. The singer is one of the most acquisitive collectors of the artist, who is known for his ability to catch the unusual light of places such as Falmouth harbour, where he based himself from 1883. He was also a regular painter of the fishermen and teenage boys who used to strip off and swim in the harbour. The exhibitions are at the Royal Cornwall Museum in Truro, from May 10, and at Falmouth art gallery, opening tomorrow.

The Guardian revealed last month that schools had requested a second opinion for more than 100,000 English test papers for 14-year-old pupils over the past three years.

Press Association Congestion charge barely affects London air quality The congestion charge has done little to improve air quality in London, researchers said yesterday. Since the toll was introduced in central London in 2003 car numbers have fallen by a fifth, but research by a team at Kings College London showed there had been little or no change in pollutants such as smog, diesel soot and carbon monoxide, and a slight increase in nitrogen oxide, New Scientist reported. Frank Kelly, who led the research, said the rise in nitrogen oxides may be due to the filters on the growing number of buses which trap soot but let gases out into the atmosphere.
