Rest assured, the price is more than matched by the elephantine size: at almost 2ft long, The Circus is less coffee-table book than actual coffee table. It's clearly the fruit of Herculean labours. Editor Noel Daniel scoured the photo albums and archives of a host of former performers and circus historians, selecting 900 images from a hoard of 300,000, most of them previously unpublished.
