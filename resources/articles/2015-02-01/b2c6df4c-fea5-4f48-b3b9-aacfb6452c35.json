The museum in Burnley, Lancashirewas founded just 11 years earlier in a medieval mansion acquired by the local authority, but was already used to crates arriving from the electrical engineer as he trotted the globe, including textiles from Kashmir and ceramics from Mexico. This time he had sent something extraordinary: the mummy of a 12th century Peruvian nobleman, snatched from what his relatives must have hoped would be eternal rest when they buried him deep in a cave in the Andes. He was buried with a selection of beautiful pottery: Taylor took that too. The mummy, which normally lives in a cardboard box at Towneley Hall, is now the strangest object in an exhibition in London of the treasures and oddities Lancashire industrialists and entrepreneurs gave to local museums in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including: Turner watercolours; Millais drawings; a set of coins of English monarchs and Roman emperors unrivalled outside the British Museum; Greek icons; stuffed birds, and beetles. A local paper feared the beetles might terrify lady visitors. The gifts came when the region was booming on cotton, but it now includes some of the areas of greatest deprivation in the country, and as local authority funding is relentlessly squeezed, the museums are suffering. Curator Cynthia Johnston says many of the treasures are rarely on display at their Lancashire homes, which have been hit by repeated cuts in budgets, staff and opening hours. \u201cI really fear for the future of these places, and I hope this exhibition may make more people realise what wonderful things they hold,\u201d she said. Their treasures, from Towneley Hall and from museums in Blackburn and Accrington, are now on display until 19 April in the annual free winter exhibition at Two Temple Place, one of London\u2019s most startling Victorian buildings, a Gothic fantasy originally created as the London headquarters for the American-born millionaire Lord Astor. The fantastic illuminated manuscripts and early printed books in the exhibition, including a Shakespeare third folio, were collected by Robert Edward Hart, who came from a rope-making family. Typically, he once travelled by train to Maggs Bros book dealers in London with \u00a35,000 in pound notes in a carpet bag: if the bookseller had wanted \u00a35,001, Johnston said, Hart would have gone away again. When Maggs\u2019 owners complained that it was going to take its clerk hours to count the cash, Hart explained he had not wanted his bank to know how much he was spending on books. Co\u2013curator Jack Hartnell said the best insight into the mummy snatcher came from Taylor\u2019s diary, on display beside his prize. The diary is visually startling, bound in the shaggy fur of a llama, but singularly un-illuminating, he said. \u201cTaylor clearly thought of himself as an Indiana Jones figure, scrambling down into the darkness, bones everywhere, attacked by bats, his candle repeatedly going out. But I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s really a bit dull. The only change in him by the end of the diary is that he has lost his moustache.\u201d The mummy had a reputation at Towneley for being haunted, and when the curators came to collect it for the London exhibition, one of the volunteers warned them solemnly that every time it was moved, blood was shed. \u201cSure enough, one of the helpers did gash his thumb,\u201d Hartnell said cheerfully, adding: \u201cSo far, nothing more dire.\u201d Cotton to Gold, 2 Temple Place, London WC2, free, until 19 April"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
