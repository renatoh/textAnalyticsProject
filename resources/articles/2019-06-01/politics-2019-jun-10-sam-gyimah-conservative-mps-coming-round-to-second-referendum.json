Gyimah, who is the only candidate campaigning for a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d, said some of his rivals realise that the country is heading for a second referendum when faced with the choice between that outcome and no deal, but they would prefer to have that imposed by parliament. \u201cThere are a number of leadership candidates who recognise this. They don\u2019t want to propose it and they want it done to them rather than say it in the contest,\u201d he said. The former minister said there were \u201csubstantial numbers\u201d of Conservative MPs now ready to accept that returning to the electorate may be the only way to break the impasse. \u201cSupport for a second referendum grows when it is pitted against no deal,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe the stark and unwelcome choice we will face under a new prime minister is no deal or a second referendum, and at that point support of Conservative MPs grows even further. \u201cWe are still at the stage where people are nervous of that option, because it is seen as a Lib Dem option, but the only thing that matters is how we pursue the national interest.\u201d He said all the other candidates were engaged in \u201cwishful thinking\u201d about the potential for getting a variation of Theresa May\u2019s deal through parliament, especially those who think Labour MPs would come to the rescue of a Conservative prime minister. Gymiah also accuses his rivals of \u201cnot being straight with the electorate and the country\u201d by offering solutions that \u201cwe know will not work but are politically convenient\u201d \u2013 from renegotiation of the backstop to the idea that \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d. To those who rule out a second referendum, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not what you want. It\u2019s not what you like. It\u2019s what you can deliver. And there is no other plan out there to break the deadlock in parliament. \u201cWhere this is headed ultimately is going back to the people and letting them back into the process. There is a risk for the Conservative party that Labour get there first. At that point, you have a Conservative party that will struggle politically as it will have set its face against the only path that can bring a resolution via the people.\u201d Gyimah needs to submit the names of at least eight supporters to the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers in order to make it to the next round of the contest, and only about six Tory MPs have publicly campaigned for a second referendum. However, he highlighted the 15 Tories who voted for a confirmatory ballot on a deal and roughly 20 who abstained during the indicative votes process, warning his colleagues that it would be better to lead the country on the issue of a people\u2019s vote than to be forced to accept it by Labour. \u201cThere is a growing number of Conservatives who increasingly recognise this is the reality but don\u2019t want to put their heads above the parapet,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not measuring my success simply by what happens in the leadership contest. It is about where we are headed and trying to move my party along to that position so that we own that solution rather than eventually having to follow the opposition.\u201d Labour has not yet unequivocally moved to campaigning for a second referendum, but Jeremy Corbyn has said he would support a confirmatory ballot on any deal negotiated with Brussels. Gyimah, who resigned from the government last year because he could not support May\u2019s deal, said it was important now for a second referendum not to be seen as a Liberal Democrat or Labour solution, but one that could be supported by everyone across the political divide in order to bring closure. \u201cOne of the unfortunate things is that a second referendum has been tainted by remain, when in actual fact it is a process that will lead to an outcome,\u201d he said, backing a two-stage question of leave versus remain and then deal versus no deal. \u201cThe country can still vote leave very loudly if it wants to. Then remoaners would have to shut up. But we\u2019ve got to get beyond the current divide.\u201d Referring to Donald Trump\u2019s style of politics, Gyimah also hit out at the \u201cTrumpian machismo\u201d of other candidates, who were all competing on \u201chow hard a Brexit can you offer\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve now got to a situation where renegotiating a backstop is what tame people offer. If you really want to be tough, you\u2019ve got to contemplate proroguing parliament to deliver no deal. This is the problem. The debate is moving further and further towards the extremes. Now, if you mention a Norway-style deal, that is seen as a proxy for remain. That is incredibly worrying.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
