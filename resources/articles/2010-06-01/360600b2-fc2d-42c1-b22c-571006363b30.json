But there is something about the claustrophobia of Ingmar Bergman's work, as we know from Scenes From A Marriage, that lends itself to adaptation. And Jenny Worton's version of Bergman's Oscar-winning 1961 movie proves to have a strange, haunting theatrical power. Bergman's story, originally shot on his dwelling place of Faro, shows us four people on an island. \"Everything will be perfect this holiday,\" blithely announces Karin as they arrive. But she appears to be suffering a bipolar disorder which throws the problems of those around into sharp relief. Her doctor husband, Martin, is caring but ineffectual; her younger brother, Max, who aims to be a writer, is full of pubescent anguish; and her father, David, who actually is a novelist, is afflicted by the artist's clinical detachment. The focus, however, is on Karin, who is torn between two worlds and drawn to a derelict room where she is convinced that she will have a direct encounter with God. I don't find it easy to determine what Bergman is saying: it is never wholly clear whether he sees Karin as a victim of religious hysteria, or as someone with privileged access to an ecstasy denied to the well-adjusted. But, as so often with Bergman, what emerges strongly is the pervasive sense of guilt. One suspects he pours a lot of himself into David \u2013 who emerges, like Chekhov's Trigorin, as someone who observes life without experiencing it, and who inhabits his own selfish creative cocoon. At the same time, Bergman empathises with Karin's husband, whose loving kindness to his sick wife only serves as a form of exclusion. I was reminded of Mark Haddon's recent Polar Bears, which also showed the burden of those who attend the mentally ill. The difference is that Bergman, for all his occasional obscurity, offers no lofty conclusions, leaving it to us to decide whether Karin's crisis ultimately forces the family to confront its own failings. The piece is impeccably directed by Michael Attenborough who creates, against Tom Scutt's grey seascapes, a sense of escalating emotional tension. Ruth Wilson, with her pendulous upper lip and deep-set eyes, powerfully conveys Karin's capacity to inhabit two dimensions. And there is fine work from Ian McElhinney, strangely resembling Bergman himself, as Karin's semi-detached father; from Justin Salinger, as her unavailingly devoted husband; and from Dimitri Leonidas as her sexually tormented brother. Running 90 minutes, the play is intense and demanding. But it explains exactly why Bergman endorsed O'Neill's dictum that \"dramatic art that does not impinge on the relationship between man and God does not interest me\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
