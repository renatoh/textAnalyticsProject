More than 3,000 young girls were indecently photographed by Glyn Martin, 53, who used his own unwitting foster daughters to lure young friends to his home, where many were drugged and assaulted. Police have tested DNA from Martin, who kept a secret room full of images, cuttings and other material at his home in Bridlington, North Yorkshire, against material from unsolved child murders because of the violence of some of his images. The court heard he used face paints on his unconscious victims after winning their trust and then drugging them. Martin initially refused to enter a plea, but then started shouting \"I want to plead guilty, I'm sorry for wasting your time,\" after the crown case began. He then admitted 57 counts of indecent assault, child abduction, indecency with children, administering a noxious substance, and taking indecent photographs. Michael Harrison QC, prosecuting, said that in 1997 Martin had been sacked from a face-painting business in Bridlington because of concerns about the way he touched children. But he was able to start up his own rival painting booth unchallenged. Martin avoided most suspicions, the court heard, by taking his foster daughters with him. But his 13 years of secret abuse were uncovered when a joiner found a list of pictures which had slipped behind a cupboard and sent it to police. Detectives subsequently found the locked room with 6,000 photos of some 2,000 girls aged between two and 12, photographed between 1987 and 2003. A further 12,000 pictures were on undeveloped rolls of film, involving a further 1,100 victims. Martin was remanded in custody, with the prosecution statement continuing today and sentencing by Judge Michael Mettyear expected later this week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
