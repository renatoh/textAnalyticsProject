Rajar's comments came hours after Mr MacKenzie, who is the chief executive of TalkSport owner Wireless Group, issued a writ demanding \u00a366m in compensation for advertising revenues he claims to have lost because Rajar undermeasures his audience. After taking advice from lawyers, Rajar today said it was \"highly likely\" that Mr MacKenzie's claim would be thrown out before it reached court. Earlier today, the former Sun editor promised \"shocking revelations\" about the way in which the body collects information about radio services in the UK. He also threatened to take separate action against its main customers, the BBC and the body that represents commercial radio companies including Capital, GWR and Emap. \"Rajar would contest the proceedings vigorously, and refuted claims made in the Wireless Group press release,\" said the Rajar managing director Sally de la Bedoyere, who took the helm last year following the departure of Jane O'Hara. \"Leading counsel advise that it is highly likely the claim will be struck out before it comes to trial. It is not surprising that the ludicrous claims relating to financial losses are for the purposes of a press release, and are not detailed in the proceedings,\" she added. Mr MacKenzie claimed Rajar's research methods were \"fraudulent\" and demanded the courts force it to abandon its current system of measuring listenership. Mr MacKenzie wants Rajar to drop its pen and paper diary system and switch to an electronic measurement system. The organisation tested electronic systems last year, but rejected them claiming there were inconsistencies with the results. The writ also hit out at Rajar's testing process for the two forms of electronic measurement on offer, saying it was unscientific and started from the premise that the existing diary system was 100% accurate. In a statement, Rajar said it was \"confident that the claim that the Rajar tests of electronic measurement are 'fatally flawed' is without merit and, indeed, that it focuses on one small area of testing\". It added: \"Rajar has made it evidently clear that its decision - that it was not yet right to adopt meters without further testing - was taken after exhaustive tests in the studio and the field. It has also made it clear that there were considerable costs and non-disclosure agreements attached to these tests,\" it added. It said the decision to postpone the introduction of electronic measurement was unanimously passed by the members and the advisors of the Rajar board, including the BBC, the Commercial Radio Companies Association, the Radio Advertising Bureau, the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising and the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers. Launching his action today, Mr MacKenzie said he had been forced into legal action after more than three years of attempting to persuade Rajar to change its methods. \"My opponents have tried desperately to kick the issue into the long grass because they are making a hell of a lot of money out of this fraudulent system,\" he said. \"Today signals the end of my attempt to seek straightforward change through negotiation, and the beginning of the final stage in which I will make my case to a judge while they make theirs,\" he added. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
