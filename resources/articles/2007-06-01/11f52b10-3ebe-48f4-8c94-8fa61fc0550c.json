The company has made the appointment as it seeks to limit the damage from the stream of corruption allegations levelled against it. But it has emerged that Lord Woolf will only be allowed to look at BAE's future conduct and nothing from its past. He will not be scrutinising any of the arms deals which BAE is alleged to have won through corrupt means in the last 20 years, nor the \u00a31bn payments to Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia over the past decade. BAE is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over allegations that it paid bribes in Tanzania, the Czech Republic, South Africa, Romania and Chile. This has prompted criticism from anti-corruption campaigners that Lord Woolf's inquiries will amount to a whitewash, a claim denied by associates of the former lord chief justice, who is currently in Qatar. They point out that he can be robustly independent, particularly as he stood up to a series of home secretaries over judicial policy. An associate said: \"It is a preposterous idea to think that the former lord chief justice would sign up to carry out a whitewash. It is highly unlikely.\" He also defended BAE's decision to prevent Lord Woolf scrutinising allegedly corrupt deals from the past: \"It is a nonsense to expect that such a review would investigate deals that are being investigated by the SFO. It is also a nonsense to expect such a review to look back at things which happened 20 years or so.\" His appointment comes less than a week after the Guardian revealed allegations that BAE paid \u00a31bn to Prince Bandar, who played a key role in giving the huge Al-Yamamah arms contract to the company in the 1980s. Sources close to Lord Woolf denied suggestions that news of his appointment was hurriedly leaked to deflect the impact of the allegations made in last night's BBC Panorama programme about BAE. His associates say that Lord Woolf was hired by BAE \"several weeks ago\". They added that the peer would head a committee whose remit and composition is still being finalised. Some of the other members have been appointed. Yesterday BAE would not discuss his appointment. It is not known what powers Lord Woolf will have to examine BAE's internal records or question executives. The salary he will receive has not been disclosed. Nick Hildyard, spokesman for the anti-corruption group the Corner House, said: \"If BAE is prepared to have an investigation, why did it go to such lengths to squash the Serious Fraud Office inquiry? This can only cast doubt on the independence and remit of any BAE-instituted inquiry.\" In recent days the SFO's assistant director, Helen Garlick, has been in Tanzania and South Africa to pursue its inquiries."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
