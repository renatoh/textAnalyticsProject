The airline was struggling even before the coronavirus pandemic, and the closure of Thailand\u2019s borders has been a devastating blow. The company has launched a number of novel initiatives to raise cash in recent months. It has put bags made from life vests and slide rafts on sale, and opened an airline-themed cafe selling in-flight meals in Bangkok and a food stall selling dough fritters. It has also opened its Airbus and Boeing flight simulators to the public. The new flight will not land at any destinations, but will fly over temples in 31 provinces before returning to Bangkok. Passengers will be given a prayer book and special meal, and tickets range in price from 5,999 baht (\u00a3149) to 9,999 baht (\u00a3248). Several other airlines have launched \u201cflights to nowhere\u201d during the pandemic, including the Taiwanese carrier EVA, which has sold journeys from Taipei, and Japan\u2019s ANA, which offered Hawaii-themed flights after its service to Honolulu was suspended. Indonesia\u2019s national airline, Garuda, has sold its in-flight meals as takeaways, and Singapore Airlines has been charging customers up to \u00a3360 a head for dinner on a stationary plane. The pandemic has cost airlines tens of billions of dollars. Thailand, where tourism accounts for up to 20% of GDP, remains mostly shut to foreign travellers. Only small select groups of tourists are allowed to enter the country. Thai Airways is attempting to restructure 245bn baht (\u00a36bn) worth of debt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
