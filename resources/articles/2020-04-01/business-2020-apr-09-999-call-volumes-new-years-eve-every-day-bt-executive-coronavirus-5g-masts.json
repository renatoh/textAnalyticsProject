Marc Allera, who runs BT\u2019s consumer division including mobile operator EE, made the comments while addressing the issue of a spate of attacks on mobile phone masts by conspiracy theorists who believe 5G technology is responsible for, or amplifies, coronavirus. \u201cAt a time when we all need our networks more than ever before we have had quite a large number of cases of vandalism,\u201d he told BBC 5 live on Thursday. \u201cOne was even set on fire. The thing that keeps me awake at night, just imagine if there was a critical 999 call that needed to be made from that mobile mast that couldn\u2019t get through. Right at the moment we are seeing 999 calls at New Year\u2019s Eve volumes pretty much every single day.\u201d BT said that New Year\u2019s Eve is the busiest day of the year for 999 calls. The service receives 33m calls a year, with 93,000 on a typical day. On New Year\u2019s Eve more than half a total day\u2019s calls come in just a six-hour period in the evening, at a rate of about 9,000 per hour. BT said it has increased staff numbers to make sure all 999 calls are being answered quickly, and that call numbers have stabilised. The UK on Wednesday recorded the most daily deaths to date \u2013 938, close to the peaks seen in Italy and Spain \u2013 with the peak expected to be more than a week away. Allera said BT had been working with the Silicon Valley giants to take down conspiracy group pages and sites circulating false claims about 5G. \u201cIt is completely unfounded, there is not a shred of evidence linking 5G or any mobile technology to any illness,\u201d he said. \u2018We have worked hard with Facebook and Google and YouTube to take down these sites that are putting out these messages that are not true.\u201d Earlier this week rival Vodafone revealed the volume of calls to the NHS 111 helpline had surged by 400% since coronavirus became a national health crisis. Vodafone, which provides the lines and handles the call traffic for the NHS 111 call centre, said it had doubled capacity to handle 2,400 calls simultaneously."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
