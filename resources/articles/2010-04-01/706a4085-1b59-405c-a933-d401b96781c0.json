A play-off between the winners of the Heineken Cup and what will by 2012 have become the Super 15 has been mooted many times before. The Guardian, however, understands that all the major unions are now fully behind the proposal and are redoubling their efforts to finalise a firm date for the match, which would be staged in Europe, possibly in early December. Premier Rugby Limited, the body that represent the leading English clubs, has been heavily involved in the negotiations, with the professional club game collectively desperate to sidestep the continuing recession and to bolster revenues. Officials are also concerned that any delay in organising the match will leave the way clear for promoters from outside the sport to take advantage. Mark McCafferty, the PRL chief executive, said: \"Our clubs, as well as those in Europe and the southern hemisphere, have had approaches from Monaco, Abu Dhabi and, most recently, from South Africa. If the stakeholders within rugby don't create this, somebody else will and we'll find an outsider coming in.\" The prospect of the reigning European champions, Leinster, playing the Super 14 holders, the Bulls from South Africa, at a sold-out Aviva Stadium in Dublin would be an attractive one for fans and broadcasters and could generate substantial income for the game. \"It's us who have been pushing it,\" McCafferty said. \"The only issue we're trying to crack is the date. The sticking points at the moment are the dates of the new domestic competitions in the southern hemisphere, but we're still working on it. I think it's got to be around the autumn time, either pre or post the autumn internationals. That's the only time when the southern hemisphere teams are still playing and the majority of their players are in Europe.\" McCafferty, however, is well aware that the calendar is congested. Under Premier Rugby's deal with the Rugby Football Union, the majority of England internationals, for example, would be unavailable from late October until the end of November. The first weekend of December might be feasible if all European clubs are in agreement. \"We can manage it because, at most, only two clubs from an individual league \u2013 whether it be France, England or the Magners League \u2013 would be affected, so you're only having to rearrange one fixture,\" McCafferty said. \"We've developed something that isn't disruptive to existing competitions. Everyone has got an appetite to do it if we can just find a date. Further discussions are continuing with the southern hemisphere to see if we can find one.\" In the short term, he does not feel that taking the fixture to a neutral offshore venue would be beneficial. \"You've got to do it in a rugby heartland. I don't think going to play in an empty stadium somewhere would be beneficial.\" The RFU has indicated privately it is behind the concept and the French Rugby Federation is also believed to be supportive. The Sanzar nations have been concerned for some time about declining attendances and interest, particularly in competitive marketplaces like Australia, and are working hard to raise rugby union's profile. Rugby league already has a World Club Challenge, most recently staged in February when the Melbourne Storm beat the Leeds Rhinos 18-10 at Elland Road."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
