The dysfunctional nature of Capello's England regime was exposed once again after the Italian revealed in a television interview, actually conducted on Monday but broadcast prior to last night's friendly against Hungary, that he considered Beckham too old at 35 to continue a career that has encompassed 115 caps, 17 goals and three World Cups. \"Thank you for helping me during the World Cup, but probably [he is] a little bit old,\" Capello said. \"Thank you.\" Yet the Italian last night admitted that he had, as yet, been unable to communicate as much to the Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder, who is in rehabilitation from an achilles injury, in the 48 hours since the interview was conducted, with Beckham's representative duly reacting in surprise at the news. While there is little shock in Capello's desire to select youthful players such as Theo Walcott and Adam Johnson, who excelled in last night's 2-1 win over Hungary, the clumsy breakdown in communication with Beckham is troubling. The veteran sat on the England bench among the coaching staff at this summer's World Cup, yet his representative was moved to issue a statement last night denying that Beckham would ever consider going voluntarily into international retirement. Asked whether he had telephoned the midfielder to tell him that he would no longer be selected for competitive games, Capello said: \"No. No. But I think I will speak with him. We tried to speak with him. I think David knows that he has no future with the national team because we have to change. Probably someone has rung him now before I called him. We tried to speak with him, but we haven't managed to. \"Someone asked me about Beckham [on Monday] and I said we have to look for new players, young players. You can see this evening the new players who can play on the right and left wings. I think, I hope, that when David is OK he can play here in a friendly at Wembley to say 'goodbye' and 'thank you very much'. \"I won't pick him for any more competitive games. I change it. We need players for the future with Fabio Capello and the managers after me. I have to look for new players. He was a fantastic player but age is important for all people, not only David.\" That friendly is likely to be in November, probably against France, although Beckham was unaware of Capello's decision ahead of last night's game. \"There has been no discussion of retirement,\" the player's spokesman said. \"He will always be available for his country, when fit, and if needed he will be there.\" The current captain Steven Gerrard, whose late brace deflated Hungary, praised his former team-mate's contribution over an England career that began back in 1996. \"He's got legendary status, without a doubt,\" said Gerrard. \"He was a fantastic captain and, if he has played his last game, he'll certainly be missed both on and off the pitch. But you never know with David. I'm sure that, if he hears that news, it'll drive him on and he'll try to prove people wrong.\" The lack of communication follows on from the embarrassing retirements of Paul Robinson and Wes Brown over the weekend following their selection for last night's friendly against Hungary. \"But Paul Robinson knew he was in the 38 players who had been advised [they were to be in the provisional squad] and he didn't telephone us to say 'no' then,\" said Capello. \"It was only when he was in the 23 that he said no.\" The furore rather overshadowed an England performance that was encouraging at times and infuriating at others. The abuse that had been anticipated following the team's failure at the World Cup was directed at a quartet of players \u2013 Wayne Rooney and the contingent of starters from Chelsea \u2013 though there was a chorus of boos at the interval with the game goalless and when Phil Jagielka put through his own net to edge the Hungarians ahead. Rooney was barracked upon his substitution midway through the second half, appearing to applaud all sides of the ground sarcastically as he departed, though others in the 72,024 crowd sought to drown out the catcalls with applause. There were similar shows of petulance in South Africa, particularly after the draw with Algeria in Cape Town, with Rooney having now failed to score for country in 11 months. \"But I'm not worried about a rift (between Rooney and the fans),\" said Capello. \"The supporters love Rooney, I'm sure. He's a really important England player and can make the difference in every game. We have to wait. He's not in a good moment and has to play more. Probably he won't be good for the next game that (Manchester United) play in the Premier League, either. He's a big player, but he needs to play more games. \"There is criticism because the fans want him to make a difference and to play really well. But he couldn't have played better than this evening. He's had 45 minutes in one pre-season game, 45 minutes in another and 65 minutes tonight. It would be impossible to have played better. \"I'm happy because we found new players tonight. There was pressure in this game, and the players can take big confidence from how they did: (Kieran) Gibbs did well, Bobby Zamora too, and Ashley Young and Adam Johnson. I would have played (Jack) Wilshere more but he was in hospital last night with stomach pain and only returned to us at 5am, so he could play only 10 minutes.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
