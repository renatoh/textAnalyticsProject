Tuilagi has not featured in any of this month\u2019s Tests at Twickenham and is described by the head coach as \u201cvery doubtful\u201d to face the Wallabies on Saturday. The 27-year-old has been named in a 28-man squad preparing for England\u2019s final Test of the calendar year, unlike the discarded Danny Care and Alex Lozowski, but Jones is prepared to wait until next summer if necessary to unleash a fully fit Tuilagi. \u201cWe are just being patient,\u201d said Jones. \u201cHe could potentially be something a bit different for us and we want to make sure he\u2019s 100% right. He\u2019s 99.9% \u2026 it\u2019s just that last little bit. We won\u2019t pick him until we get that right. The World Cup starts in September, there\u2019s still plenty of time.\u201d Jones\u2019s desire to include Tuilagi in his World Cup plans is no secret but a tweaked groin on the eve of the South Africa game this month has forced the England management to put his return on hold. Jones has now chosen 11 different centre pairings to start for England since taking over at the start of 2016 and the decision to drop Lozowski before the encounter with the Wallabies suggests he is still seeking the perfect formula. While the versatile Saracens player did not have his best afternoon against Japan and was replaced at half-time, he remains a talented ball-player with plenty to offer if England want a second midfield playmaker. Jones still appears to favour that option, having unexpectedly recalled Northampton\u2019s Piers Francis, but with Chris Ashton requiring a scan on a sore calf it would be no surprise to see Joe Cokanasiga named on the bench against Australia. Care, after 84 caps, is a conspicuous absentee, however, with Richard Wigglesworth\u2019s box-kicking prowess among the possible reasons. \u201cWe weren\u2019t happy with some aspects on Saturday and Danny can go away and work on them,\u201d said the head coach. Nathan Hughes is also back available in the back row following suspension, with the slightly less imposing Zach Mercer missing out. Jones\u2019s belief that international rugby is increasingly a strong-arm contest in many positions was merely strengthened by Saturday\u2019s Ireland-New Zealand Test, where the fleet-footed All Blacks three-quarters struggled to win the gain-line battle. \u201cLook at the Tests at the weekend, how physical and brutal they are,\u201d Jones added. \u201cIt is becoming a real power game. It showed where rugby is going \u2026 the physical demands on the players are getting greater and greater.\u201d At the same time, Jones argues, the mental demands are also intensifying, with Ireland particularly adept at plotting their way past the All Blacks. England, conversely, were conspicuously out-thought in the first half against Japan, before they belatedly got a grip in the second half. \u201cGames are now lasting 100 minutes and for 60 minutes of that the players have to think,\u201d said Jones. \u201cThe ability to think is going to become an even more important part of the game.\u201d It is among the reasons England have recruited Will Carling to their backroom staff as they try to enhance the players\u2019 clarity of thought under pressure. Jones insists, though, that Ireland\u2019s impressive win over the All Blacks will not impact on next year\u2019s World Cup. \u201cIt will have no consequence. None at all. The only thing that counts is when you get to the World Cup. Ireland had a set of tactics, they stuck to them and it worked for them. The ball bounces your way sometimes. Those leprechauns helped the ball bounce in the right direction.\u201d Jones also believes the defeat will do New Zealand no serious harm. \u201cIf I was Steve Hansen I\u2019d be hurting now but they\u2019re going to learn a lot. They\u2019ll come back stronger and better.\u201d For now Jones is more preoccupied with setting a new record in Anglo-Australian Tests by guiding England to a sixth successive win over the Wallabies, coached by his former Randwick team-mate Michael Cheika. \u201cHe is a good guy, passionate about Australian rugby doing well, and I\u2019m sure there will be better days for him,\u201d said Jones. \u201cLet\u2019s just hope it is not Saturday.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
