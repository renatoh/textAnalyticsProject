It was only the second minute of the match when Bardsley hurtled over an onrushing Drew Spence to clear and landed awkwardly on her shoulder. In front of the new England manage,r Phil Neville, England\u2019s number one \u2013 who has not long returned from the leg break she suffered in England\u2019s Euro 2017 quarter-final win against France \u2013 received lengthy treatment on the pitch before being carried off on a stretcher; the 18-year-old Ellie Roebuck replaced her. City\u2019s, and Neville\u2019s, problems were added to late on when their captain, Steph Houghton, limped off. After the early delay Chelsea, with the fresher legs \u2013 Emma Hayes having made five changes to the side that beat Everton 1-0 on Sunday \u2013 started on the front foot. Crystal Dunn combined nicely with Ramona Bachmann on the left but the Swiss international\u2019s shot across goal failed to test Roebuck. The south London side had the creative edge but struggled to break through the resolute Manchester defence. Nick Cushing made one change to the side that put three past Sunderland at the weekend, Claire Emslie making way for Mel Lawley, and it was Lawley who was the league leaders\u2019 brightest outlet, her electric pace down the left troubling Chelsea\u2019s Hannah Blundell and Millie Bright. After the break Chelsea continued to look sharper and as the game moved into the final 15 minutes the home side began to up the pressure. Spence was twice held at bay by Roebuck, first one-on-one, then when a powerful header ended with the keeper landing dangerously close to the line clutching the ball. The Chelsea manager, Emma Hayes, whose side remain two points behind City, said: \u201cWe played better. You could see by the end they were struggling to keep up; you\u2019ve got to take your chances but it\u2019s not the end of the world, it\u2019s a point gained."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
