The \u00a31 costume from Manchester-based online retailer Missguided went on sale nearly a fortnight ago, but hit the headlines last week when it was advertised during Love Island \u2013 a show the retailer has used for its promotions before. Last year Missguided sponsored the show and the few clothes worn by the contestants were all from its ranges. The black bikini did indeed cause the expected internet sensation, but not for its sex appeal. Fast fashion critics took to social media to label it a symbol of a throwaway fashion culture that now sees British shoppers throw away a million tonnes of clothing each year. The outrage was heightened by the government\u2019s decision on Tuesday to reject plans for a 1p fashion tax that had been proposed following an investigation by MPs on the Commons environmental audit committee (EAC). Until then, Missguided\u2019s biggest problem had been keeping up with customer demand: the bikini was selling out in every size \u2013 from 4 to 24 \u2013 within 45 minutes after each restock. Founded a decade ago by Nitin Passi, Missguided is among a small number of internet fashion brands to have enjoyed success at a time when the traditional high street is on its knees. While big names like Marks &amp; Spencer (M&amp;S), Topshop and Monsoon are struggling to hang on to their ageing customer bases, Missguided and online rivals Asos, Boohoo and PrettyLittleThing have cleaned up, selling inexpensive fashion to young women in their teens and twenties who shop online rather than on the high street. Passi told the Observer that despite the furore, the company was not embarrassed about the \u00a31 bikini as it was being sold at a loss as a marketing stunt \u2013 designed to pull in the punters to sell them other items at the same time. \u201cI think we have to careful not to confuse the symbolism of totems with real issues,\u201d says Passi. \u201cThe \u00a31 bikini was priced to generate interest and we\u2019re not embarrassed about it. We\u2019ve always lived close to the edge when it comes to marketing, but we\u2019re comfortable with that because there are never shortcuts when it comes to the product.\u201d The 36-year-old entrepreneur, who started Missguided in 2009, accepts that it was perhaps \u201cinevitable\u201d that the product would be judged in the context of the government\u2019s response to the EAC. But he adds: \u201cOur \u00a31 bikini was sourced no differently to anything else we offer. It was made by one of our audited supplier partners and with the same meticulous attention to detail as every item on our site, whether it\u2019s \u00a320 or \u00a3200.\u201d With the exuberance of a dotcom-era startup, Missguided\u2019s headquarters in Salford Quays \u2013 sandwiched between the Manchester United stadium and the BBC\u2019s Media City \u2013 feature a \u201cselfie tunnel\u201d and a meeting room with swings instead of chairs. In one YouTube video the former Cranleigh schoolboy conducts a tour of the HQ he refers to as a \u201ccrib\u201d while riding a hoverboard. Britons buy more new clothes than any other country in Europe, with high-street clothing chains in thrall to a fast-fashion model that demands new products arrive in store every week \u2013 rather than at the start of each season \u2013 to satisfy shoppers\u2019 insatiable appetite for novelty. Missguided claims that it goes one better than fast fashion by offering \u201crapid\u201d fashion, with 1,000 new products landing on the site every week: dresses start at \u00a38 and you can buy a pair of jeans and a T-shirt for around \u00a320. By last year the business had shifted more than \u00a3200m worth of clothes, although it is still a minnow compared to market leader M&amp;S, which has a clothing business worth more than \u00a33bn. Despite a welter of consumer surveys highlighting the growing ethical and environmental awareness of millennials and Generation Z, the sales of online fashion companies tell a different story. At the last count, Boohoo\u2019s sales were up 27%, while PrettyLittleThing\u2019s had surged by 42%. Asos\u2019s sales last year were \u00a32.4bn. Those huge sales uplifts are coming in a \u00a348bn clothing and footwear market that has been shrinking for several years \u2013 as, despite the shocking picture of waste revealed by the EAC inquiry, Britons are buying fewer clothes and choosing to spend their disposable income on other things. \u201cI would argue that what consumers say and do are in reality two different things,\u201d says Retail Economics\u2019 chief executive, Richard Lim, who points to the huge success story that is Primark, despite its historical connection to the Rana Plaza factory disaster in Bangladesh. \u201cThe consumer surveys paint a different picture, but there is not much evidence of shoppers voting with their wallets and taking their spend away from these [fast-fashion] retailers.\u201d In 2017, when Missguided was exploring bringing in outside investors, the company \u2013 which is 100% owned by Passi \u2013 was judged to be worth as much as \u00a3700m by analysts. However, its wings were clipped spectacularly a year later when the decision to open a handful of stores proved disastrous and the company crashed to a pre-tax loss of \u00a346m in 2018. The Missguided stores failed to cover their costly rent bills and Passi, who had ceded some control to senior management, was forced to retake the reins and lead a turnaround. The business is now in a \u201cmuch better place\u201d, he says. Like Umar Kamani, the larger-than-life 31-year-old boss of PrettyLittleThing, Passi has created a brand that resonates with a new generation of shoppers which marketers say are hard to reach. The Missguided brand is all about \u201cbabe power\u201d: its customer base are all \u201cbabes\u201d and the website featuring a \u201cbabeZine\u201d where they can read about everything from \u201cWTF do I wear for massive boobs?\u201d to working in social media. Passi insists the business is not built on his family connections \u2013 his father is a successful clothing supplier \u2013 since their expertise is in dressing a different demographic: \u201cI borrowed \u00a350,000 from my dad in 2009 and paid him back in 2010,\u201d he says. Missguided is based in Manchester mainly because Passi\u2019s uncle offered him free office space at the back of one of his factories to get started. He attributes its success to a nimble business model that is able to react to what its customers are talking about on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s about the speed of what we offer,\u201d Passi says. \u201cTalking to them where they are through social.\u201d The rise of internet shopping has been a major factor in the current high-street crisis: online marketplaces such as Amazon and Asos have altered the way many Britons shop forever. This shift has contributed to the financial collapse of the Debenhams and House of Fraser department store chains but also smaller brands at all price points, from upmarket kitten-heel seller LK Bennett to inexpensive clothing chain Select. A new report on the UK shopping market by global real estate adviser Colliers International makes the case that the \u201cgolden age\u201d of online retailing could be coming to an end as websites start facing up to the shortcomings of their own business models \u2013 not least the cost of processing their daily mountain of returns. James Watson, Colliers\u2019 head of retail capital markets, says: \u201cThe days when you could order three items of clothing in different sizes, in the knowledge that you could return them free of charge, are coming to an end. Online retailers are making moves to improve their [profit] margins by changing their service to customers.\u201d Recently, online giant Asos changed its returns policy to clamp down on \u201cserial returners\u201d \u2013 shoppers who regularly buy clothes, wear them and then return them for a refund. Its perceived challenges are reflected in a share price that has fallen by nearly 60% over the last year as investors question an investment-hungry business model amid slowing growth and a profit squeeze. \u201cPeople are realising that there\u2019s no such thing as truly \u2018free delivery\u2019,\u201d says Watson, who points to the prospect of suburban roads clogged with delivery vans. \u201cThe upcoming generation of shoppers is questioning the wisdom of items travelling huge distances \u2013 only for them to be returned and rack up more \u2018product miles\u2019.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
