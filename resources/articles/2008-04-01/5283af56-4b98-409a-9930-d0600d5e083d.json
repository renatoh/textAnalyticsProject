But most Somalia experts agree: things have never been this bad. A brutal guerrilla war, three years of drought, hyperinflation and restricted aid agency access that compares only to Iraq have pushed the country to the brink. Philippe Lazzarini, the UN's head of humanitarian affairs for Somalia, this week said that a \"massive, massive crisis\" was brewing, with 2.5 million people needing food or other assistance. \"We are on the eve of what triggered the massive international intervention [the disastrous US-led relief operation] in 1992,\" he said. Asha Haji Elmi, who heads the Mogadishu-based Save Somali Women and Children project, said the humanitarian need and security situation was \"unprecedented\", with a complete culture of impunity among all sides to the conflict. Dennis McNamara, who works at the Swiss-based Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, said a new international approach was needed to help a country that was \"beyond a failed state\". All the warring parties, including the Islamist \"Al Shabab\" movement, recently given terrorist status by the US, need to be engaged. \"Somalia has been in the international community's 'too hard to solve' basket for more than a decade,\" said McNamara. \"Unless we act now it is headed towards the catastrophe basket as well.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
