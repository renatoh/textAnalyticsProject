Don't read on if you haven't seen episode six This was a bit of an underwhelming, mid-series episode for my money, kicked off with a foolish declaration by minister Nicola Murray (Rebecca Front) that the PM is \"the best man for the job\", which of course was gleefully misinterpreted by the media as an audacious leadership bid. Nevertheless, there were a couple of memorable scenes. One was the attempt by press officer Terri (Joanna Scanlan) \u2013 watched through fingertips by everyone else \u2013 to tell spin chief Malcolm Tucker (Peter Capaldi) where exactly his media strategy was going wrong (she was right, by the way). The tension built. But Malcolm's response was a surprise. Instead of exploding, he almost broke down, lamenting the pressure the decay of the government was exacting upon him, and indulging in some baroque self-pity. Malcolm: I used to be the fucking pharoah, but now I am fucking floundering in a fucking Nile of shit. But I am gonna fashion a paddle out of that shit. Terri: (gulps) Good idea. Another great moment came with special adviser Ollie (Chris Addison)'s classic double-take after turning to see Malcolm looming like a silent vampire behind him through a window. Malcolm didn't even blink. Best swearing Malcolm on Terri's trainers. \"You're supposed to be a civil servant, not a fucking playgroup assistant.\" Best insult Malcolm to Nicola: \"Unthink the unthinkable. You can't even cope with thinking the thinkable.\" Best description of Nicola \"She's an idiot. I know she's in the cabinet, but look, that's like being disabled at a football match, yeah? I mean, she's very close to the action but hardly likely to score a goal.\" - Malcolm. Best rebuttal after being accused of being hungover \"If anything I'm hungunder.\" - Ollie. Best nostalgic attempt to cling to the memory of a 70s chocolate bar \"Curly Wurlys should be the size of a small ladder.\" - Malcolm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
