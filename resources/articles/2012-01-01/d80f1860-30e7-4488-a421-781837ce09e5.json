The government was forced to pull the plug on an earlier attempt to sell the Olympic Stadium to West Ham United and Newham Council in the face of a sustained legal challenge from the losing bidder, Tottenham Hotspur, and an anonymous complaint to European regulators. The stadium will instead remain in public hands, with the Olympic Park Legacy Company recently starting a drive to find new long-term tenants with West Ham expected to be among the bidders. Under the new plan the public purse is liable for \u00a395m in conversion costs but should see an increased upside from rent and naming rights. But Robertson told the culture, media and sport select committee that, if a football club was to change ownership and wanted to buy the stadium outright, as happened with Manchester City and the City of Manchester Stadium, that remained a possibility. \"If a football club was one of the legacy users and there should be a change of ownership, that would be built into the process. It's not designed to stay in public ownership indefinitely,\" he said. He added later: \"There is no reason why it would be a public stadium forever and a day.\" The culture secretary Jeremy Hunt, who again defended a recent decision to increase the budget for the opening and closing ceremonies by \u00a341m, told the parliamentary committee that he was \"as confident as we can reasonably be\" that the government would not bust the overall \u00a39.3bn budget for the Games. A recent National Audit Office report said there was a \"real risk\" that it would not prove to be sufficient. Robertson also said that, \"with good luck\", the \u00a3675m diverted from the National Lottery to pay for the Olympics would be returned to the pot in future. \"It is absolutely a commitment of the government to ensure that money is safeguarded. That will be written into the new agreements with the Mayoral Development Corporation. With a fair wind and good luck, that money will be repaid. There is a time lag because it is dependent on land sales. Hunt also announced that sports bodies would receive an extra \u00a3500m in lottery funds over the next five years. According to figures released by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the UK's sports bodies \u2013 including the grass-roots agency Sport England and elite Olympic sport funding body UK Sport \u2013 are expected to access \u00a31.8bn in lottery returns between 2012-13 and 2016-17, up from an estimate of \u00a31.3bn made in September 2010. Changes in the law last year increased sport's share of lottery money from 16% to 20%, while lottery ticket sales have also increased. But while the increased lottery funding is calculated through to 2017, there is no visibility beyond 2015 on what will happen to the share of funding that comes from the Treasury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
