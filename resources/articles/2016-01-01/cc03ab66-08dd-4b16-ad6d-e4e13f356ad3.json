Holding pictures of Tamir and wearing signs declaring \u201cFire McGinty\u201d, about 100 protesters marked New Year\u2019s Day by marching to the home of Cuyahoga County prosecutor Timothy McGinty. Once there, they lay prostrate on the sidewalk for four minutes: the time the boy lay unattended after he was shot on 23 November 2014. The message was clear: McGinty must not be re-elected. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for the community to understand that we are doing a rally cry, and vote McGinty out of office,\u201d said Latonya Goldsby, Tamir\u2019s cousin and the spokesman for his family. Although the latest round of demonstrations in the Tamir Rice case began just hours after a grand jury\u2019s decision was announced on Monday, McGinty had begun to feel the political backlash about a month before. That was when local Democratic ward members blocked his bid for the party\u2019s endorsement in a March primary. Goldsby said the family and activists would not endorse McGinty or his opponent. Instead, they would wait for \u201cthe people\u2019s candidate\u201d to emerge. Friday\u2019s rally was organized by Black Lives Matter Cleveland. McGinty was not at home and his office declined to comment. Tamir Rice has joined Michael Brown and Eric Garner, among others, as a representative of African-American men killed by police violence in cases in which the officers involved were not subsequently charged. Rice was playing with a toy gun in Cudell Park when police officer Timothy Loehmann killed him. Loehmann and his partner, Frank Garmback, were responding to a call about a \u201cguy\u201d brandishing a weapon. Although the original 911 call mentioned the suspect was probably a youngster and the weapon was probably a toy, the police dispatcher omitted those details. The case became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre after surveillance video showed that Loehmann shot Tamir less than two seconds after arriving on the scene. The officers maintained Tamir did not obey instructions to raise his hands, and that he seemed to be going for a weapon. McGinty did not to indict the officers and took almost a year to bring the case to a grand jury. Activists and family lawyers accused him of bias in favour of the officers, and called for a special prosecutor to handle the case. Those calls grew louder when the prosecutor submitted expert reports that called the shooting \u201creasonable\u201d and allowed police officers to read statements to the grand jury without cross-examination. At a press conference to announce the grand jury\u2019s decision, McGinty said \u201cindisputable\u201d evidence supported the officer\u2019s version of the events. After seeing an enhanced version of the surveillance video, he said he could not recommend charging the officers. He told Cleveland.com: \u201cWe knew ethically, there couldn\u2019t be a trial in this case.\u201d Joseph Frolik, a spokesman for McGinty, said in a statement emailed to the Guardian: \u201cEvery citizen has an absolute right to protest, and the death of Tamir Rice was clearly a monumental tragedy. \u201cBut we hope people will respect the decision made another group of citizens\u2014 the members of the grand jury. Grand jurors conduct a thorough investigation. They personally see, hear and question witnesses, and they reach a decision based on their oath. If you don\u2019t trust the grand jury, you don\u2019t trust your neighbors. \u201cPolice use of deadly force cases are critically important and need by reviewed, not just by a prosecutor, but by the citizens on the grand jury. In the past, prosecutors dismissed cases without a grand jury review; do we really want to return to that?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
