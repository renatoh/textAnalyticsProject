Not the call of a stray rodent, but the voice of Jeremy Corbyn. While there may be some virtue in keeping quiet while your opponent is making mistakes, there comes a time, when the country is visibly falling apart, that some people would quite like to hear from the leader of the opposition. But for much of the past week Corbyn has chosen to keep a low profile. Keep things chilled. It\u2019s a busy time of year on the allotment. The lack of vocal practice had taken its toll at prime minister\u2019s questions. The Labour leader could barely rasp out a coherent question and appeared completely unaware of the gravity of the situation. It could have been just one of his normal off-the-shelf rants. Still, even if he had found a killer line on the government\u2019s Brexit clusterfuck, there was no chance of getting a straight answer from Theresa May. For more than two years, the prime minister has spoken Maybot, a very primitive computer language only capable of basic sentences that are more or less grammatical, but still almost totally devoid of meaning. Since she became Leader in Name Only, Lino \u2013 hard to nail down, but easy to walk over \u2013 she can\u2019t even manage that. Her binary messages into deep space are now just a long series of random noughts. She literally has nothing to offer. More worrying still, her already limited random access memory has totally failed. She now has no recollection of anything she said just days earlier. All of which made PMQs yet again one of the more excruciating sessions of the week. Time and again she was asked by MPs \u2013 the Labour old guard of Ed Miliband, Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper were out in force \u2013 how she could possibly reconcile her decision to ask for a short Brexit extension with her and David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, having said that to do so would be reckless in the extreme. And every time, Lino could only look a bit confused and blurt out some random beeps. 000 0 00 00 000000 0. She was heard in almost total silence. Everyone but Lino seems to know her time is up. She has never had any friends, but now she doesn\u2019t even have any moderately supportive colleagues either among the Tory remainers or leavers. Lino is a woman unloved by everyone. Not least herself. What once could be passed off as stubbornness \u2013 or resilience, if you were feeling generous \u2013 has morphed into self-hatred. Her anger at the world expressed through acts of repeated self-harm. She dreams of her legacy, but every day that only becomes more tarnished. Brexit has stripped her of everything. The only person who enjoyed the session was Julian Smith. When the SNP accused Lino of acting in her party\u2019s interest, the chief whip smiled for the first time in months. It was the first time anyone had ever suggested he had been doing a good job. With the government effectively having collapsed in on itself into a black hole, it was left to Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, to effectively take control of the UK. Not quite what was written on the Brexit tin. Or even the bus. As Lino couldn\u2019t even get her letter to the EU in on time, Tusk delivered his own ultimatum. A short extension on condition of the withdrawal passing. After that, all bets were more or less off. Enough was enough. The EU throwing Lino a lifeline \u2013 to make remotely credible her threat that it was her deal or no deal \u2013 was just another humiliation. All of which rendered the emergency Brexit debate more or less pointless. There again, anything featuring Steve Barclay is almost by definition pointless. Everyone had always known he was dim \u2013 that\u2019s why he had been given the job \u2013 but no one suspected he was actually catatonic. A man fuelled by industrial quantities of barbiturates. Let\u2019s hope he\u2019s stockpiled enough, or he\u2019s going to go horrendous cold turkey if there\u2019s a no-deal Brexit. Barclay doesn\u2019t even have the synaptic connection to understand why everyone in the country is laughing at him for voting against a motion for which he spoke in favour. There was still time for Corbyn to have a hissy and stomp out of a meeting with the prime minister because Chuka Umunna had also been invited \u2013 you can rely on the Labour leader to choose the wrong molehill to die on \u2013 before Lino made an unscheduled TV address. Sure enough, she was even late for that. It\u2019s a wonder she can get out of bed by herself. As so often, when she did find her way to the Downing Street lectern, she didn\u2019t have anything new to add. She began by reminding everyone she had triggered article 50 two years ago and that since then she had managed to make a mess of everything. Schools, hospitals, Brexit. She\u2019d buggered up the lot of them. \u201cPeople have had enough,\u201d she said. This at least was the truth. Everyone had had enough. Of her. Of her lies. Of her contempt for parliament. Of her clinically insane belief that everyone but her was to blame. Of her dogged determination to take everyone in the country down with her. Lino concluded by saying she\u2019d see us all on the other side. If there was one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
