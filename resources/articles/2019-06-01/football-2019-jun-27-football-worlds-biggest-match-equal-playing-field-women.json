It is in the name. How it promotes that message is the unique part. Between 27 June and 1 July, with the Women\u2019s World Cup heading towards its climax, it will attempt in Lyon to break the world record for the biggest football match. This will be its third attempt at a world record. The campaigning collective holds the record for the highest altitude football match, on Kilimanjaro, and the lowest, by the Dead Sea in Jordan. This though, is another level entirely. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different challenge, in a way,\u201d says Equal Playing Field\u2019s Maggie Murphy. \u201cAt the top of Kilimanjaro, it was literally difficult to breathe. But in some ways, it was down to our training and our sheer will and teamwork. \u201cWith this one, because we are trying to expand beyond a set of 30 interesting women and we\u2019re trying to now embrace a city, a location, fans from around the world. We\u2019re trying to complement the Women\u2019s World Cup, we\u2019re trying to engage media, we\u2019re trying to work with coaches, referees \u2013 so many more moving parts.\u201d The task is massive. It needs 3,000 people to play and estimates it will take five days, playing non-stop day and night, with no half-time and with roll-on, roll-off substitutions for the duration. \u201cWhen you actually start to break down 3,000-plus players, we\u2019re looking at around 270 individual 30-minute time slots,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cWhen you think about the substitutions, never before has a fourth official worked as hard as they will do during our game. Because literally every half an hour there will be upwards of 15 to 20 substitutions.\u201d People are buying into the cause, with individuals and teams signing up. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for both female and male players,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for men who are also supporters, male allies and champions of the game, and [people who] have completely different skill sets, backgrounds. \u201cWe have some girls aged five that would like to come and play with their parents. And we have a couple of women in their 70s who have signed up as well. So all ages, all skill sets. We have pro players that are coming. We have complete beginners. And we have the UK parliamentarian women\u2019s team that will be playing on Saturday.\u201d Lyon, the biggest-spending women\u2019s football club, pioneers and hosts of the World Cup semi-finals and final, have handed over their training ground to the event and Twitter and Adidas are on board as sponsors. \u201cMaybe one of the challenges that we face is we\u2019re not a big glossy charity event, we\u2019re not a corporation,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a PR exercise. We\u2019re literally asking for people who believe in the project to come join us.\u201d Countries where Equal Playing Field have run football camps \u2013 including Palestine, Jordan, Lesotho, Costa Rica, Vietnam and Greece \u2013 are seeking sponsorship or fundraising to be part of the attempt. Alongside it, they have access to workshops and skills and coaching sessions. Adidas are funding the participation of five teams from five continents and the Association Football Development Programme is supporting the Costa Rican and Jordanian teams taking part. Equal Playing Field, in conjunction with Fifa, is running a five-day training programme for referees wanting to break into international officiating. These will run alongside the world record attempt, as will a series of workshops which will culminate in a summit on 5 July to look at the risks and benefits of the commercialisation and professionalism of women\u2019s football, women in governance, women in coaching and many other aspects, drawing on the lessons of the week. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to break a Guinness world record for the sake of breaking the Guinness world record \u2013 we\u2019re trying to inspire,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cBut also equip those players, coaches and referees with some practical skills so that when they go back home they also feel a little bit more empowered to take action to level the playing field themselves. \u201cSo we hope that will inspire some players to go home and put themselves on referee courses or just to try out for the first team. But we also hope to inspire them to take action for others. So that might be to set up the girls\u2019 team in the local school or help out with coaching at a local club. And just to get more involved and more committed to furthering the game. \u201cWe\u2019ll show that when the World Cup finishes, and the cameras stop running, that thousands of people will still be continuing to push the agenda and make sure women\u2019s football doesn\u2019t slide off it for another four years.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
