Police did not seize Andrew Millard before he killed Julie Harris, 47, because they had \"other commitments\", it was claimed. Bristol crown court heard that after the relationship broke up, Mr Millard, 42, began sending his ex-lover abusive text messages, including one which read: \"You deserve to die.\" Sarah Munro, QC, prosecuting, said that on one occasion, after finding out Ms Harris had a new lover, he made 47 phone calls and texts in one night to her mobile phone. Mrs Munro told the court: \"The contents were extremely unpleasant.\" Mr Millard, a delivery driver, was given a harassment order by Gloucestershire police in October 2004. But this failed to stop him and on October 19 last year the terrified mother of one rang police, begging them to arrest him after he kept phoning her at work. Mrs Munro said: \"She wanted him to be arrested but the police had other commitments so they didn't attend.\" The next day, the court was told, Mr Millard broke into Ms Harris's home and stabbed her seven times with a steak knife. Mrs Munro said: \"This man clearly wanted to kill her. He was obsessed.\" Mr Millard has admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility but denies murder."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
