In a joint op-ed published in German weekly Wirtschaftswoche on the eve of the president\u2019s last European visit in office, the two leaders argue that while the world is at a crossroads, \u201cthe future is already happening and there will not be a return to a world before globalisation\u201d. \u201cGermans and Americans have to seize the opportunity to shape globalisation according to their values and ideas,\u201d the article concludes. \u201cWe owe it to our business and our citizens \u2013 the entire global community, even \u2013 to broaden and deepen our cooperation.\u201d The column provides a sharp contrast to the rhetoric of President-elect Trump, who during his campaign threatened to pull out of existing trade deals and put future agreements on hold, as well as accusing Merkel of \u201cruining Germany\u201d with her refugee policy. \u201cRespect for human dignity obligates us to provide humanitarian aid for many millions of refugees worldwide, because we know the true strength of our values is measured by how we treat the weakest and most vulnerable,\u201d the article says. The Paris climate agreement, the article says, \u201cprovides the world with a framework for the joint protection of our planet\u201d. The article argues that the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) would \u201cwithout a question\u201d benefit American and German employers, employees, consumers as well as farmers. The German chancellor has been one of the key architect behind the trade treaty, which both leaders know will not be concluded before Obama leaves office. One German official told the Guardian ahead of Obama\u2019s Berlin trip that hopes for a revival of the deal under Trump were \u201cnot realistic\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
