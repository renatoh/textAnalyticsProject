An intellectual audience had its suspicion of politicians blown away by the civilised man who took to the stage to chat to The Observer's Mariella Frostrup. Open, relaxed and informed, Brown couldn't have been further from his enemies' caricature of a tax-grabbing sociopath. It was a triumph, apart from two awkward moments. The sniffer dogs that searched the festival site for explosives before the Chancellor arrived terrified the louche literati. ('Don't worry, sir,' a police dog handler told an arts broadcaster with a suspiciously runny nose, 'we're not interested in what you've got.') After Special Branch had done its work, a member of audience asked Brown a question that will nag away until the next election. 'What about the women's vote? You may struggle in that department.' 'Mariella?' said Brown. 'Write to me at The Observer and tell me about your little dilemma,' replied Fleet Street's least anguished agony aunt. Ah yes, the women's vote. Westminster hacks rarely talk about it without condescension. Put bluntly, they believe that the giddy dears can't get beyond David Cameron's good looks and good manners. Instead of admiring serious politicians, such as G Brown, the little ladies plump for the leader they fancy most. If you want evidence of their incurable fluffy-headedness, they say, look no further than the ridiculous finding that women believe the Tories will manage the NHS better than Labour. The Tories? The notion sounds absurd, but perhaps women voters aren't quite the silly creatures their critics assume. A rumbling dispute about the treatment of cervical cancer explains why. It should sober the triumphant Brownites because it may represent the future of health politics. In brief, cancer pressure groups, led by Jo's Trust, a charity for sufferers from cervical cancer, say Britain needs a national vaccination programme. Cervical cancer kills about 1,200 women a year and leaves many more infirm and infertile. The vaccine is ready to go, but to date, the Department of Health's response has been sluggish to the point of indolence. While the US, Canada, Australia and most EU countries are vaccinating girls against human papilloma virus responsible for virtually all cervical cancers, Britain drags its feet. The secretive Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has delayed taking a decision on whether to prescribe vaccinations on the NHS for more than a year. It is meeting again on 20 June, but because it takes months to publish its minutes, we may not know what, if anything, it has decided until the autumn. 'GPs don't know if they can vaccinate or if they will be reimbursed if they do,' Pamela Morton of Jo's Trust told me. 'We have parents asking if they can get their daughters vaccinated before they go to university and we have to tell them there's no sense of urgency from the government, no understanding of what the science now allows.' Since no one doubts the vaccine works - a study in the Lancet reported a 99 per cent success rate for girls who have never had sex - its supporters originally suspected that the Department of Health was worried about religious fundamentalists. But although a couple of fringe Christian groups did say they opposed a vaccine because it would subliminally tell girls that they could engage safely in promiscuous sex, and parts of the Islamic religious right opposes all vaccines on some dotty principle, the argument never took off. Preachers in America's Bible Belt and 'Dr' Ian Paisley in Northern Ireland accept that the vaccine couldn't promote wantonness because, although it stops sexually transmitted cancers, it offers no protection against the HIV. A few doctors imitated John le Carre and warned that the evil tycoons of Big Pharma were behind the demands for vaccination. Undoubtedly, drugs companies would benefit, but as doctors, Department of Heath civil servants and, indeed, ageing thriller writers turn to Big Pharma's products when they need them, the attempt to justify inaction as an anti-corporate pose also got nowhere. No, a Labour government needs a better reason to be outflanked on the feminist left by Paisley and the reason, quite clearly, is that it is running out of money. Lack of funds also explains why access to all other new cancer drugs is lower in Britain than in virtually every other developed country and it will explain every other story you read about new treatments being denied for years to come. Yet New Labour has spent a fortune on the NHS. Observer readers are well aware that far too much of it went on extortionate PFI contracts, a pig-out at the public's expense by management consultants, and unwarranted rises for doctors whose ability to inflate their pay makes Arthur Scargill's National Union of Mineworkers look like the Mothers' Union. After such a binge, women and, indeed, men are not going tolerate rationing. Quite reasonably, people who earn far less than management consultants and hospital consultants will wonder why they can't have the latest treatments when they've paid so much tax. You only have to look at the furious reaction to GPs' demands that the public pay \u00a320 for seeing doctors on six-figure salaries in the evenings to realise that an NHS that has consumed so much can no longer count on deferential patients. The Conservatives lost power in part because they didn't spend enough on health and the sick suffered. We are now in a new world where Labour has spent enough - more than enough - and the sick are still suffering. Brown assured the Hay crowd: 'I have changed. Ten years ago, even a few years ago, I felt you could pull a lever and do things; there was an assumption you could dictate from on high. But I don't think now you can solve problems without involving people.' Fair enough, and maybe he has changed. But he may find that the voters are less interested in his learning curve and more concerned that the levers he pulled flushed vast amounts of their money down the pan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
