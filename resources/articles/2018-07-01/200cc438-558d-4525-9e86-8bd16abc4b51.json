In a research project that is the first of its kind, and funded by Arts Council England, the Centre for Literacy in Primary Education (CLPE) asked UK publishers to submit books featuring BAME characters in 2017. Of the 9,115 children\u2019s books published last year, researchers found that only 391 \u2013 4% - featured BAME characters. Just 1% had a BAME main character, and a quarter of the books submitted only featured diversity in their background casts. This compares to the 32.1% of schoolchildren of minority ethnic origins in England identified by the Department of Education last year. \u201cIt is a stark and shocking figure when you see it in print,\u201d said Farrah Serroukh, who directed the project for the CLPE and presented it to publishers on Monday. The researchers also analysed the quality of the representation, as well as the quantity of BAME characters. They found that more than half the books featuring a BAME character were classed as \u201ccontemporary realism\u201d, and 10% contained \u201csocial justice\u201d issues, such as war and conflict. Only one children\u2019s book featuring a BAME character was defined as comedy. \u201cDo those from minority backgrounds only have a platform when their suffering is being explored? And how does such disproportionate variation of representation skew perspectives of minority groups?\u201d asked the report. \u201cTopics such as conflict and the refugee experience are valid subjects for authors to explore and unpick. Our concern would be if children only encounter ethnic minority representation in that context and no other,\u201d Serroukh told the Guardian. \u201cWe need books like that, but they need to sit within a wider diet of books so readers can appreciate that people from minority backgrounds have as much variety of life as everyone else \u2013 yes, there is struggle, but there is also going to the dentist, going to the supermarket. It\u2019s striking a balance.\u201d The report states that \u201cevery child is entitled to feel safe and valued\u201d, and that \u201cin the current socio-political and economic climate the risk of marginalisation is even greater\u201d. It warns publishers that if children do not see their realities reflected in the world around them or only see problematic representations mirrored back at them, the impact can be tremendously damaging. \u201cTo redress imbalances in representation is not an act of charity but an act of necessity that benefits and enriches all of our realities,\u201d the report adds. Author Nikesh Shukla, who has been a major force behind the push for diversity in UK publishing, sat on a steering committee for CLPE\u2019s report. \u201cI do feel the industry is getting better but a report like this is a reminder of how much work still needs to be done \u2013 and a stark reminder of our readers, and how our readers are not getting what they need,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re figuring out the world, being able to see yourself in books, as well as people who don\u2019t look like you, is really important. It means you see your story as valid, and it can contribute to who you imagine yourself to be \u2013 and a kid should be able to imagine themselves as anyone in the world. These mirrors are so important.\u201d His words echo those of the late American children\u2019s author Walter Dean Myers, who wrote in 2014: \u201cBooks transmit values. They explore our common humanity. What is the message when some children are not represented in those books? \u2026 Where are black children going to get a sense of who they are and what they can be?\u201d Serroukh said that the CLPE had plans to work with publishers to help them improve. Recommendations include increasing investment in authors from a range of backgrounds, looking for stories where main characters are BAME, and ensuring that they are not \u201cpredominantly defined by their struggle, suffering or \u2018otherness\u2019\u201d. \u201cAt the moment, every title out there featuring BAME characters shoulders a heavy weight. It has to fulfil so many expectations,\u201d said Serroukh. \u201cIt comes back to the issue around volume. If there are more books which are representative, then there is more opportunity for wider experiences to be expressed.\u201d Serroukh writes in the report\u2019s foreword: \u201cWe know that those who work in all areas of children\u2019s books and literacy recognise that there is work to be done. We want to channel the momentum to ensure that this isn\u2019t reduced to an awkward footnote or \u2018trend\u2019 in the history of UK children\u2019s publishing because something as integral as a person\u2019s identity and sense of self deserves to be recognised, respected and valued now and always.\u201d Like a long-running equivalent survey in the US from the University of Wisconsin-Madison \u2013 which has charted a slow increase in BAME characters over the last decade and a half \u2013 the CLPE report is intended to be annual. A separate piece of research, by the BookTrust, is also currently under way, examining the number of authors and illustrators of colour working in children\u2019s publishing. The BookTrust findings are due in September. Serroukh said she hoped CLPE\u2019s research would be useful as a starting point to help publishers reflect. \u201cHopefully in 10 years\u2019 time, or however long, it will become redundant,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are really keen for the UK market to develop a more nuanced conversation. We don\u2019t want to be talking about volume in three years\u2019 time, but about quality.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
