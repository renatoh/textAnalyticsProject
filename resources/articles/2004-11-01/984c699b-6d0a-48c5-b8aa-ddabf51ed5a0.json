The visitors are in shaky form and have struggled on their travels in Europe and the French league. Arsenal to beat PSV Eindhoven 1pt at 5/4 (Premierbet) Arsenal may be struggling but this price it too big. PSV have an outstanding record in the Dutch league but that counts for little in Europe. They were unimpressive on their visit to Highbury in September and have looked only marginally better than the other sides in the group. A small wager on the English champions is the best route to profit. CSKA Moscow v FC Porto: sell total goals 1.5pts at 2.2 (generally available) The home side will look to keep it tight as a point may be enough to keep them on track for the second round. Porto have struggled on their travels so far and have managed just one goal in four European games. Werder Bremen v Internazionale: buy total goals 1.5pts at 2.8 (generally available) The German side are favourites to win as Inter have already qualified for the knock-out stage, but Inter are determined to maintain top spot. Attack is the best form of defence for the Italians as their back line is poor, while Werder Bremen need to win to qualify so goals are on the cards. Shakhtar Donetsk to beat AC Milan with a +1.5 goal head-start 1.5pts at 4/5 (Sporting Bet) The Ukrainians, an excellent side, are unlucky to have fallen in the same group as Milan and Barcelona. They destroyed Celtic 3-0 and go to the San Siro looking to maintain third spot in the group. Milan are without their three first-choice strikers, Andrei Shevchenko, Jon Dahl Tomasson and Filippo Inzaghi - so don't expect a huge winning margin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
