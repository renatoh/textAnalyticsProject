The US investment bank, which employs some 5,000 people in London, told its 62,000 staff that it would shed 4% of its workforce. By revealing the scale of its job cuts, which are expected to fall most heavily on Wall Street, Morgan Stanley contrasts with rivals which have refused to be specific about the extent to which they have reduced staff. Neither Merrill Lynch nor Goldman Sachs would give details of their cuts, although the latter is said to have shed 650 jobs from a total workforce of 22,000, including some senior managing directors. Other Wall Street firms to have announced layoffs recently include Charles Schwab, the online brokerage, Citigroup and Bear Stearns. Morgan Stanley was understood to be talking yesterday to employees caught up in its largest retreat since it was formed from the merger of Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter, the retail broker, more than three years ago. Most of the cuts will come from operations in New York and Silicon Valley although some 200 jobs will go in Europe and some in Asia. Anxiety about job cuts follows a rapid recruitment drive last year. However, most investment banks are anxious to avoid the problems Merrill Lynch faced three years ago after it sacked 5% of its staff during the Asian economic crisis but later felt its business had been damaged. Three weeks ago, Morgan Stanley denied reports that it would sack 1,000 retail brokers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
