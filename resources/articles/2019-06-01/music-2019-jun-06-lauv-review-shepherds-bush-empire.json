His three biggest songs have collectively racked up a billion streams and he has been playing stadiums supporting Ed Sheeran. As a jobbing songwriter, he has worked for Charli XCX and Celine Dion. Just before tonight\u2019s show, he takes delivery backstage of a gold disc for his song I Like Me Better (720m streams), and when he lopes on stage \u2013 a young Eminem lookalike encased in XXXL sportswear \u2013 it is to a wail of joy that rattles the balconies. The intensity of his relationship with his fans could perhaps end up militating against household-name stardom. As someone who frequently writes about living with depression, this performer seems best suited to close-quarters bonding. Witness the merch counter where, alongside T-shirts proclaiming this single London date a \u201cUK tour\u201d, there is a box that Lauv explains is for those who want to write a note about \u201cwhatever\u2019s weighing on your mind \u2013 people have been writing about eating disorders, being in love with their best friend \u2026\u201d The song that follows this entreaty, Superhero, is an anthemic bonding moment between the crowd and a singer who personifies youthful unease more vividly than most, through the simple device of unusually candid songs. Tonight\u2019s opener, Drugs &amp; the Internet, is a jaunty bop about the difference medication can make. On Paranoid, he breaks out a crushing falsetto to agonise: \u201cWhat do I feel? Who do I trust?\u201d Love isn\u2019t much cop for him, either. A highlight tonight is the achingly fed-up I\u2019m So Tired, a recent duet with Troye Sivan. Nevertheless, roaming the stage with the ambling gait of a rapper \u2013 \u201cWelcome to a night of really awkward dancing!\u201d \u2013 and at one point popping up to sing in the balcony, Lauv is in a sweet spot. This smallish venue is a good place for an overthinking romantic to commune with a likeminded public, savouring the intimacy while he still can."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
