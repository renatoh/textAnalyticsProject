The Charlton owner Roland Duch\u00e2telet, who is still attempting to sell a loss-making club, had released a remarkable statement via their official website on Monday afternoon suggesting Bowyer would leave upon the expiry of his deal at the end of this month. They claimed Bowyer \u201cfeels he should be paid like many other Championship managers\u201d and added: \u201cThat the average Championship club makes a loss of around \u00a315m per year is not something players should care about. The owners are crazy.\u201d Yet Bowyer is understood to have contacted Duch\u00e2telet immediately after the release of the statement \u2013 which had prompted a furious reaction among the fanbase \u2013 and conducted further talks with the owner overnight, with compromise duly reached. \u201cWe went on a real journey last season,\u201d said the manager, who had originally been appointed on a caretaker basis at the club before taking over permanently last September. \u201cThe club came together \u2013 the players, the staff, the fans and we achieved something special. The journey hasn\u2019t finished yet and I\u2019m delighted this has all been agreed. \u201cThis has been a long process and I never wanted to leave, I love this club. I\u2019d like to thank the owner for giving me the initial opportunity and now for continuing to believe in me. We have a fantastic fanbase here and my focus continues to be getting our squad in the best possible shape for the Championship next season.\u201d Charlton finished third in League One and defeated Sunderland in the play-off final to secure a place in the second tier after a three-year absence. Duch\u00e2telet had cited Bowyer\u2019s desire to use an agent to negotiate a deal as potentially constituting a conflict of interest over transfer policy. \u201cWhat Lee has achieved in his short time at the club is very impressive,\u201d said the owner, who is attempting to sell Charlton to the Cardiff City chairman, Mehmet Dalman. \u201cHe has united the club once again. \u201cI would like to thank Lee for his professionalism during this process. While the negotiations have been ongoing, he has continued to work on building a squad for the club\u2019s Championship campaign. Stability is essential and I am very pleased we now have the best man in place to lead us forward next season.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
