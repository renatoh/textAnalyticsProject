A whopping \u00a336bn is now available for researchers across Europe to carry out studies in areas ranging from information and communication technology to energy and space research. The funding is available through the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7) which, after marathon negotiations, brinkmanship and 11th-hour deals, was launched on time on January 1. FP7 is organised into four programmes: cooperation, ideas, people and capacities. The cooperation programme, which accounts for 64% of the total budget, will support collaborative research projects in 10 key subject areas. The bulk of the money will go to ICT (\u00a36.1bn), followed by health (\u00a34.05bn), transport (\u00a32.8bn), nanotechnology (\u00a32.3bn), energy (\u00a31.5bn), and food, agriculture and biotechnology (\u00a31.27bn). Other subject areas, including environmental science, space, security, and social-economic sciences and humanities, will receive around \u00a31.2bn. The ideas programme will fund blue-skies research through a newly created European Research Council with a budget of around \u00a35bn. The ERC represents a radical change in direction for research funding in Europe. The financing of blue-skies research, which has often produced military applications, has remained the preserve of national governments. Training and career development will be supported through the people programme, with a budget of around \u00a33.18bn, and the capacities programme will fund the coordination and development of research infrastructure, regional clusters, international cooperation, and closer ties between science and society, with a budget of \u00a32.7bn. The first calls for proposals were issued on December 22 2006, with 21 calls in the cooperation programme, one in ideas, five in people, and 14 in capacities. Announcing the agreement, the UK's science minister, Malcolm Wicks, said: \"We have reached agreement on the whole package of the Seventh Framework Programme. This is a great achievement. It ensures that this crucial funding programme for R&amp;D is ready for business. The UK has played a major part in shaping the final programme. Key features include the establishment of a European Research Council, based on the principles of autonomy and excellence, and an allocation of 65% of the budget to industrial, user-driven research. The programme will help Europe raise its innovation and R&amp;D performance, with the UK playing a key part. This agreement is good for Europe and good for UK researchers and businesses.\" \u00b7 Natasha Gilbert is news editor of Research Fortnight. ng@researchresearch.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
