Until Friday's mountaintop-stage finish in Liechtenstein, Ullrich was wearing the leader's jersey that he won nine days ago: he's looking fantastic - as good as he's ever been for the Tour. Ullrich is thin, but doesn't have the transparent look he does when the Tour comes around. You can tell when a guy is in form from the way he rides in the bunch, and Ullrich is just gliding through the other riders. It's awesome: he was putting the best riders here under a lot of pressure when he won the first stage, and his T-Mobile team have been riding strongly too. There have been some tough mountain stages and he's been comfortable at the front. It's going to make for an interesting build-up to the Tour as Lance Armstrong didn't perform as well as people expected last week at the Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 race in France. If Ullrich is on this form, and Armstrong isn't as good as in the past, it could mean we're in for a Tour that is at least as exciting as last year's. Whether I will be there is still up for grabs. In common with the other French teams, my squad, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, won't announce the bulk of their Tour team until next week and they won't finalise it until after the French championship on 27 June. There's a good reason for this: it would be embarrassing to name the team, then have a rider who isn't going to the Tour win the French title. Only two riders in the team are certain to go: Christophe Moreau, who will be looking for a high overall placing, and our sprinter Thor Hushovd, who's been in fine form recently. I'm in a group of nine in contention for the other seven places. Riding the tour is something I have wanted to do since I began cycling and it's been a goal all year, but I can be fairly cool-headed about whether I make the final cut or not because this year my overriding target is a gold medal in the individual pursuit on the track in Athens. Because of that, I've told the team that I can only ride 10 days of the Tour at most. I can't risk any more because it would affect my preparation for the Olympics. The ball is in their court. I can go to the Tour, ride a good prologue time trial. It's flat, six kilometres, so a great result would be top 10; a top five would be fabulous for me. After that I could be handy placing Thor at the front at the end of the flat stages, as he will be going for the green points jersey. Then there's the team time trial, where we will be going all out to put Christophe in a good position. The gamble is whether they want to start knowing that after 10 days they will be a rider short. That's fine, unless they lose another one or two through crashes or illness. There's also the question of whether it's fair to take a rider who's only there for 10 days ahead of a guy who's looking to last the full three weeks. I'd love to ride it, but I won't get depressed if I don't. I've ridden five stage races in the past seven weeks, so I've got a huge base of endurance fitness to take me up to the Olympics. It's vital to do this kind of racing as you just can't replicate in training the efforts you make as a professional. On Thursday, for example, we had a mountain stage with two 30km climbs, each of which took 90 minutes. I was riding at the back, but a day like that is still a huge effort. I've raced 65 days so far this year, since I started in late January. It's the kind of foundation that, assuming I can fine-tune my form over the next nine weeks, should enable me to get down to about 4min 15sec for the 4,000m pursuit in Athens. It's been the most important part of my Olympic build-up and now there's that small question of getting the ticket to the Tour.
