Ruby Princess blame shifting A team of 30 detectives has started investigating the handling of the Ruby Princess coronavirus scandal as the New South Wales and federal governments continue to point the finger at each other over who is to blame for the fiasco. Earlier on Wednesday the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age newspapers reported that an Australian Border Force official ordered the Ruby Princess to dock in Sydney Harbour, despite a Sydney harbour master offering to halt the ship at Bradleys Head. Australian Border Force later issued a statement confirming that it was contacted by the NSW Port Authority in the early hours of 19 March \u201cexpressing concern in relation to the health of passengers on board the Ruby Princess\u201d. But it says it was NSW Health who gave the all-clear for the ship to dock. Meanwhile, officers from the NSW state crime, counter-terrorism and marine area commands are trying to get the bottom of the scandal. Fourteen people who were passengers on board the Ruby Princess have since died. The first briefing into the investigation was held on Wednesday morning, NSW police said.
