A 13-year-old boy was charged by police over the killing of Christopher John Barry, 53, while four other boys aged 13 and 14 have been released on bail. The boy has been remanded in custody to appear at Highbury Corner youth court on Tuesday charged with murder, Scotland Yard said. Barry was trying to enter the Brickland Court flats in Edmonton on Sunday evening when he got involved in an argument with a group of teenagers. Police said a supervised party was under way in the building, and the boys were trying to gain access. Barry, who was accompanied by a woman believed to be his girlfriend, entered the building but was followed by two boys and stabbed. \u201cThe victim and this group were not known to each other \u2013 what started as a minor verbal altercation has escalated into a shocking act of violence,\u201d said the lead investigator, DCI Neale Baldock of the Metropolitan police homicide and major crime command. Police were called to the flats by the London ambulance service just before 8pm, but Barry was pronounced dead at the scene little more than half an hour later. A postmortem examination on Monday gave the cause of death as a stab wound to the chest. On Tuesdaya neighbour described comforting Barry\u2019s girlfriend immediately after the attack, which left the area outside her flat covered in blood. \u201cWe heard noises and we came out and there was blood all over the first floor,\u201d said Petronella Muzengi. \u201cShe came into our flat and said: \u2018They\u2019ve killed him, they\u2019ve killed my boyfriend.\u2019 \u201cWe tried to calm her down but she was in a terrible state. It was terrible, I was trying to comfort her but I was very scared.\u201d Muzengi, 50, has lived in the housing association block since it was built seven years ago and it was the first time she had seen such violence at first hand. \u201cThese little boys, they are just children.\u201d Edmonton is trying to crack down on violent crime: Sunday\u2019s killing was the third in 16 days. In separate incidents on 30 November, Khiry Ford, 23, was fatally stabbed in the chest by a hooded attacker during a street fight, while pPolish national Maciej Godlewski, 52, died after suffering head injuries during a fight. Brickland resident Dolly Mbaya, 32, said he was planning self-defence classes for his 10-year-old son. \u201cI\u2019m scared for my own life and I\u2019m scared for my son,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had been coming through the door at the same time, I know I would have been involved too.\u201d He said it was not uncommon for young people to carry weapons. \u201cI grew up in that sort of environment but I would never have carried a knife, people who did were 20-25. Now they are kids. Whether it\u2019s for protection or because they want to be gangsters.\u201d Resident Loretta Gabriel, 50, said she had cancelled a party for her 16-year-old daughter\u2019s birthday. \u201cShe is very, very scared \u2013 we all are,\u201d she said. She said difficult economic times were contributing to youth violence. \u201cWe are living here with this, but the government don\u2019t care about the poorer class. There is more poverty, more stress and we old people know how to cope with that but young ones don\u2019t.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
