Except for that one drawback, Brunei Darussalam is a fine country - clean, orderly, free of income tax, blessed with pristine jungle, tropical weather and cheap petrol. I had expected a relatively easy task in my clock simultaneous exhibition against the national team. I was surprised to find myself pitted against some very young juniors at the newly inaugurated federation headquarters. Brunei is planning for the future, as the BCF president, Zainal Abidin Ali, proudly told me. The standard was very respectable, with even the youngest having a fair knowledge of openings and good grasp of midgame strategy. Training by their national coach, IM Tahir Vakhidov from Uzbekistan, is starting to have an impact. The final result, 7-0, somewhat flattered your columnist. Five or even three years hence I very much doubt I will be able to repeat such a feat. The leading Brunei player is 22-year-old Ak Hirawan. He attacked me like a homicidal machete-wielding maniac, which gave me a few nervous moments. Nevertheless when I quickly beat off the assault, it was time for him to resign. Perhaps a measured approach would have been more successful. Mind you, extreme violence was the key to victory in the game below. Hirawan, Ak (2299) - Harika, D (2392), 5th Asian Individual Chess Champion-ship, Hyderabad, India, 8/10/05 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 e5 4.Bc4 Be7 5.d3 d6 6.0-0 Nf6 7.Ng5 0-0 8.f4 Nd4 (A rare continuation. More popular are 8...Bg4 and 8...exf4.) 9.fxe5 dxe5 10.Rxf6!? (Caveman chess. This is a dangerous but nevertheless Black should be able to defend without too much sweat.) Bxf6 11.Qh5 Bxg5 12.Bxg5 Qd7! (Black correctly rushes to exchange off queens) 13.h3?! (A logical move for someone bent on all-out attack. However, it would have been wiser to acquiesce to simplification by 13.Rf1 Qg4 [13...b5!? 14.Nd5 bxc4 15.Ne7+ Kh8 16.Ng6+ Kg8 17.Ne7+is just a draw.] 14.Qxg4 Bxg4 15.Be7 Nxc2 16.Bxc5 with equality.) 13...b5?! (Overambitious. After the simple 13...Kh8! 14.Rf1 f6! fortifying the position, White has little to show for his boldness.) 14.Nd5! (Excellent! Not pausing for breath.) Ne6 DIAGRAM (If 14...bxc4? 15.Nf6+ gxf6 16.Bxf6 Ne2+ 17.Kh2 Nf4 18.Qg5+ Ng6 19.Qh6 mate follows on h6) 15.Nf6+! gxf6 16.Bxf6 Qd4+ 17.Kh2 Qe3 18.Rf1! bxc4 19.Rf3 Qxf3 (Black has no choice but to part with her queen.) 20.Qxf3 (20.gxf3! is stronger, planning to advance the pawn to f5 later.) Re8 21.Qg4+ Kf8 22.Qh4 Kg8 23.Bxe5 Nf8 24.Qg5+? (24.Bf6! Re6 25.e5 threatening Qg5+ and Qh6 would have won forthwith. The text is good enough but it entails quite a lot of faffing around) 24...Ng6 25.Bc3 a5 26.h4 cxd3 27.cxd3 c4 28.h5 (Snaring the knight and essentially deciding the outcome. The rooks are no match for the queen here.)
