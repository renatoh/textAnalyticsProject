The Foreign Office said: \"The vast majority of visits to Turkey are trouble-free. Turkey is one of a number of countries where there is a threat from domestic terrorism and an increased risk from international terrorism, which the Turkish authorities are tackling with vigour and so far, in the tourist areas, effectively. \"We advise against any non-essential travel, including holiday travel, to south-eastern Turkey and, if already there, to maintain a high level of vigilance and to consider whether your presence is essential. Developments on Iraq and any further increase in regional tension could affect our travel advice. You should check it daily and follow developments closely.\" The update advice on Turkey comes a day after the Foreign Office posted a series of warnings on its website urging British nationals not to travel to the majority of the Middle East. British nationals are advised against \"non-essential travel including holiday travel\" to Jordan, Bahrain, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Syria and Lebanon, and any visitors already in these countries are recommended to leave at the earliest possible opportunity. Britons have also been advised to leave Kuwait and to avoid travel to Israel. The Foreign Office cites the threat from Iraq and a \"high risk\" of terrorist attacks. It says: \"In view of the risk of hostilities with Iraq, there is an increase in the threat to British nationals in neighbouring countries. \"The threat to British individuals and organisations from terrorism is now high. It will rise further in the event of hostilities with Iraq. Terrorist attacks in the region could involve the use of chemical and biological materials. \"There is also a risk of an attack from Iraq in the event of hostilities. This might involve chemical and biological weapons.\" \u00b7 Full details of the revised Foreign Office travel advice can be found at www.fco.gov.uk/travel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
