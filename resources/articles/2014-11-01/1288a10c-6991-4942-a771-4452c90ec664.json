Bjorn Olsson, the executive director of the Tarrytown Music Hall in New York, released a statement which addressed calls for the venue to cancel Cosby\u2019s date on 6 December. Olsson said that cancellation could prove so costly to the venue that it would have to reduce staff as a result. Writing on the venue\u2019s Facebook page, he stated that even though the show was booked by an outside promoter, the venue would still have to pay Cosby a guarantee fee if they cancelled. He said: \u201cSince he is a very expensive artist, this would be a tremendous blow to the Music Hall, likely to force layoffs and cuts in our community programs. So, in short, cancelling the show or refunding tickets would not hurt Bill Cosby \u2013 only the Music Hall, a non-profit organisation, and the promoter.\u201d The statement follows one from Cosby\u2019s management that was posted on the website of the Maxwell C King Center for the Performing Arts in Florida, which said the show would go on regardless of the accusations against Cosby. \u201cMr Cosby is a well-respected member of the entertainment community and one of America\u2019s most beloved performers,\u201d it stated. \u201cWhile we are aware of the allegations reported in the press, we are only in a position to judge him based on his career as an entertainer and humanitarian.\u201d The two performances are among five gigs Cosby has scheduled before the end of the year, and the first since the accusations have resurfaced. The Centre In The Square and Budweiser Gardens, both venues which are hosting Cosby gigs in early 2015, were not able to comment when the Guardian contacted them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
