By instinct he is a volatile manager, peppering his assessments with quaint imagery and sweeping judgment. Back in his native Bristol, his thoughts wrapped in a torrent of words and West Country vowels, he never raised his voice: \"Boring stuff, wasn't it?\" Rangers, with as much to play for as City - two teams attempting to end recent stutters with an automatic promotion place - rarely suggested they were on the way out. Their first-half display lacked a creative edge and twice they had to lean on the brilliance of their keeper Lee Camp. \"We were too static, tense and nervous and it was a terrible goal we conceded,\" added Holloway. City had more pace and purpose. \"It seems we respond in bigger games like this,\" said their manager Danny Wilson. \"Our discipline was excellent. But let's not start talking about promotion. I can still see a lot of chopping and changing in the next few weeks.\" Wilson caused surprise by not allowing post-match interviews with his players. \"I want them to focus on the football without distractions,\" he said, as if one or two bland sentences for a notebook might have a detrimental effect. Scott Murray was the wanted player. His scoring rate for a winger at Ashton Gate last season was exceptional; then he went off to Reading. It was not a productive move and this was his homecoming, as encouraging as it was sentimental. He took a short time to readjust to the old touchline roots. The fans willed him to score a nostalgic goal but instead he created the winner for Christian Roberts five minutes before half-time. The home keeper Steve Philips had virtually nothing to do. Yet he in turn brought off a crucial save five minutes from the end. By now Holloway had introduced cunningly two Bristol exiles, Jamie Cureton and Tony Thorpe off the bench. Thorpe, a renowned snatcher of late trifles, was thwarted by a superb sprawling save when an equaliser, if hardly deserved, looked a certainty.
