A call for another convention in a year's time was enthusiastically applauded. But will today's event mark the beginning of something new \u2013 a written constitution, a modern bill of rights, or even (as one delegate put it) the kind of civil disobedience that most of the politicians present today could never endorse? If, as Alan Travis suggests, today has exposed Conservative disagreement over the Human Rights Act \u2013 David Cameron wants to replace it with a bill of rights, Dominic Grieve seemed rather less keen \u2013 then it may succeed in entrenching a piece of legislation whose future looked precarious under a Tory government. Chris Huhne made a brief but passionate defence of the Act in today's second plenary, pointing out something not made clear enough: the protection a European declaration of human rights affords to those who are not British, or to those whom we might deem un-British in the future. For some, securing the HRA might be victory enough. Others will want to see the identity card scrapped \u2013 still a Conservative pledge, and repeated again today. Still others want a document that enshrines such things as the right to privacy and which the range of legislation summed up as \"the database state\" can be measured against. (Has the US election inspired greater faith in all things constitutional? Maybe. Yet as Afua Hirsch pointed out, it didn't prevent some of the worst abuses of the Bush administration.) Quite how that document might come about was a moot point. Will Hutton favoured a sort of wiki-constitution, thrashed out online; Brian Eno thought the honours list should be replaced by invitations to join a drafting committee; Chris Huhne took inspiration from Ontario and British Columbia, which asked randomly selected citizens to come up with ideas. But the biggest surprise to emerge from today's convention is the traction that the issue of civil liberties has gained at a moment when the economy, and the environment, might seem more pressing. The Labour parliamentary candidate Chuka Umunna rather misjudged the mood by predicting that the government might well crack down on cold callers \"who disturb you at home\" and junk mailers. Nice try, Chuka, but this was a very meagre bone. The delegates are working up a rather bigger appetite. \u2022 See more on the convention and civil liberties at liberty central"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
