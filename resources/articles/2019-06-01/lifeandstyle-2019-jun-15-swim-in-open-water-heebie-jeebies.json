Be prepared for the heebie-jeebies", "bodyText": "I wanted to see if I could swim a long distance in open water. So I headed to the open sea, ploughing alongside an underpopulated Isle of Wight beach, braving an unseasonal May in a swimsuit, not a wetsuit, guesstimating time and distance to what I thought was around half an hour, and imagined \u2013 fondly, groundlessly \u2013 was about a kilometre. On the first day, I discovered I\u2019d been swimming for 10 minutes. Second day, a bit under 12 minutes. Third day, 10 minutes. Not only was I not getting any stronger, I wasn\u2019t getting any less deluded. But there was something else going on, some combination of my own poor technique and the vast unknowability of the ocean, that was actively throwing me off. Getting nowhere on my own, I needed some input from people who knew stuff. Nathaniel Cole and Peigh Asante run the Swim Dem Crew, a group of social swimmers who do epic open-water adventures (as well as training novices) and recently co-hosted an event with Nike Swim, which is promoting open-water swimming. All their sentences start in exciting ways (\u201cWhen we did the Dart 10k swim\u2026\u201d \u201cWhen we were in Finland\u2026\u201d). It\u2019s all about the arms, Cole tells me. Long-distance running makes sense because you\u2019re using your largest muscles. Endurance swimming makes no sense at all, or not with my arms. It\u2019s a huge amount of body to power along with muscles the size of clementines, and that\u2019s the biceps. My triceps don\u2019t even warrant the name. Cole and Asante train novices with hand paddles, like baseball mitts. The theory is that when you remove them, your body has an ideal efficiency to aim for. \u201cIt\u2019s all about how many arm cycles it takes you per length. You want to have as few as possible,\u201d says Cole. Anything you can do to maximise your stroke, whether it\u2019s technique or brute strength, will be the difference between getting somewhere and getting nowhere. The crew do towing exercises, where you hold on to a partner\u2019s legs while they do arms for a length, and then swap \u2013 like a wheelbarrow race. There\u2019s something else, though: what about the heebie-jeebies? Looking out at the unending space and then longing for land? Even proper swimmers get this: Asante tells me about a swim in Croatia when they went out at 5.30am. \u201cI was swimming along naturally and then the sun came up,\u201d she says. \u201cAs soon as I saw how clear the water was, I noticed how deep it was. I\u2019m a confident swimmer, but usually the water\u2019s murky and I never think about it. Suddenly, I could see fish. It made me realise how small I was, how insignificant, a stranger in someone else\u2019s territory.\u201d I think it\u2019s good for the spirit: you\u2019re meant to break through a fear barrier every day, if you want to feel alive \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to see how you do that without interrupting regular life. It\u2019s also good for the fundamental questions of existence: who am I? A tiny speck. What\u2019s my purpose? Something tiny. But until you\u2019ve got some upper-body strength, it\u2019s easy to become discouraged. I\u2019m going to get some hand paddles. What I learned Eat like a rower for endurance swimming: porridge and bananas. True swimmers pack sweets in their wetsuits."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
