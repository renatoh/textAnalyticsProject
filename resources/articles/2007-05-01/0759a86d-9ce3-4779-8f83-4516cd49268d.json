The 38-year-old defender lifted the trophy for the second time as captain and for the fifth time in his remarkable career after the 2-1 win against Liverpool in Athens on Wednesday night and considers the achievement further evidence that his team are the best on the planet. \"This club has provided me with a lot of amazing emotions and this is another example,\" he said. \"We've been the best team in Italy, Europe and the world over the last 20 years and the cycle hasn't ended yet. We've got something different to other clubs. We've had this special mentality for some time.\" Although Maldini's claims of domestic dominance are questionable, the Rossoneri's all-time European record is second only to the nine-times winners Real Madrid. In the past two decades Milan have won the trophy five times, been runners-up three times and reached the semi-finals nine times. Carlo Ancelotti, himself a four-times winner, twice each as Milan player and coach, claimed this to be his sweetest success, given a trying start to the season in which at one point his side were thrown out of the Champions League as part of their punishment for the Calciopoli match-fixing scandal. \"It is our greatest victory,\" he said. \"We've done something extraordinary. I tried to get the best out of every player but motivating them wasn't difficult. This win was born last November, which was the toughest moment of the season - we could have lost everything but we didn't, and from then on we started something special.\" Ancelotti must now keep a promise he made in the build-up to the final. A prodigious smoker all of his adult life, the 47-year-old has promised to kick his 30-year habit. \"I made a vow before the final that if we won I'd quit smoking,\" he said. \"It won't be easy but I'll have to do it now.\" Another with a pledge to honour is the midfielder Gennaro Gattuso, who will have rather different highlights to reflect upon this summer. \"I said I would go blond,\" he confessed. \"But only after Italy's games in June.\" The World Cup winner now has a second Champions League medal to add to his 2003 success and was relieved to have avenged the 2005 final defeat by Liverpool. \"Two years ago in Istanbul it was us who were in tears,\" he said. \"Now it's their turn to cry.\" The Italian press were universal in their praise of Milan's seventh European crown with La Gazzetta Dello Sport printing their traditionally pink front page in the red and black of the Rossoneri. \"Hooray!!!!!!!\" ran the headline, the exclamation marks making the point in no uncertain terms. The Milan president, Silvio Berlusconi, who has witnessed five Champions League wins during his 21-year ownership of the club, claimed a chunk of the credit. Despite having tried to persuade Ancelotti to start with Alberto Gilardino instead of Filippo Inzaghi, Berlusconi said: \"I told Inzaghi he would score two goals and I was right . . . It is particularly wonderful to win this, as we have gone some way to wiping away the pain of Istanbul, which was still weighing heavily upon us.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
