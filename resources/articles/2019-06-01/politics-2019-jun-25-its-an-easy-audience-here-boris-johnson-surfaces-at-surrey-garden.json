In telephone calls and texts, Johnson\u2019s campaign team gave the Guardian the runaround over his exact location, leading the Guardian on a wild goose chase via Woking and the RHS headquarters in central London, before his team eventually insisted there would be no media access. A taxi driver in Westminster, one of the places the Guardian mistakenly went, said: \u201cI think he\u2019s nothing but a distraction from the reality that Britain is currently facing. He is clearly trying to avoid the public, he doesn\u2019t answer questions at all.\u201d Johnson\u2019s team finally directed the Guardian to Richmond but declined to give specifics. Near the Tory party association headquarters on Upper Richmond Road, on the heels of Johnson\u2019s cadre who had already departed, a painter and decorator who, like all other interviewees, did not want to be named, said: \u201cHe just said hello to us and waved back for about 15 minutes \u2026 I think he\u2019s a good chap, he\u2019s what the world needs, really.\u201d Another bystander, a thirtysomething Tory voter pushing a pram, was less impressed. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has been particularly truthful about his current romantic situation, and if someone does not tell the truth about their personal life then how can they be trusted in office?\u201d Johnson has been increasingly associated with gardens, from the scene of his now infamous photo with Symonds to his doomed Garden Bridge project, so the RHS garden in Surrey was an apt location for the next pitstop. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe he was wasting his time round here,\u201d said a woman who had been having lunch. \u201cHe wanders in with an entourage, security, cars and cameras, instead of being where he should be \u2026 at the debate [against Jeremy Hunt] on Sky which he\u2019s cancelled to come to Wisley.\u201d Her friend, a Tory member who said she would be voting for Johnson, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s the man he used to be. He\u2019s not conducting himself in the right way if he really wants to be PM, which is a shame because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone else.\u201d Stopping to collect her thoughts, she added: \u201cHe has changed, I do wonder if he\u2019s going off the idea a bit.\u201d Despite it being in a constituency with a Tory majority of 17,000, most people to whom the Guardian spoke at Wisley were unaware that Johnson had come and gone. \u201cI\u2019m not a Boris fan but it\u2019s an easy audience here, he\u2019s a clever man \u2013 despite acting like he isn\u2019t, quite often,\u201d a woman said. \u201cIt\u2019s all manufactured.\u201d Waiting to be told the location of the next stop, the trusted photographers following Johnson\u2019s entourage admitted they found the tour sycophantic. \u201cHis first question and only question was: \u2018Are you Tory members?\u2019\u201d one said, describing the team around Boris as \u201cfurtive\u201d. After receiving a tip about the next location, they left and apologised for not being able to take anyone with them. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s all about trust.\u201d That location transpired to be Oxshott, an affluent village five miles away. Johnson bought \u00a34.50 worth of fennel and tarragon sausages from the butchers, had a sip of tea in a cafe and drank a glass of water in a pub. Those present said he refused to discuss the provenance of the Symonds photo and rejected suggestions he had avoided scrutiny. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to hear about it,\u201d Johnson told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond satire.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
