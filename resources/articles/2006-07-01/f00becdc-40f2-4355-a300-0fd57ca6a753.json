But with an exceptional player - like Ornette Coleman with his mid-1960s trio, Joe Lovano in recent times, and in this instance the brilliant former Miles Davis sideman, bandleader and educator Dave Liebman - it can exert a special fascination. Liebman's partners here are bass guitarist Steve Swallow and drummer Adam Nussbaum, with a programme of originals and classics including Monk's Played Twice and Miles Davis's All Blues. Liebman's range is immense - from the funky uptempo tenor barrage of What Time Is It, to the inquisitive Steve Lacy-like soprano on Played Twice, to the mix of Stan Getzian tenderness and almost abstract tonal flexibility on I Only Have Eyes for You or the soft flute mysteries of The Jewish Warrior. Highlights include the rugged, somewhat Rollins-toned tenor break against Swallow's slyly punchy bassline and Nussbaum's fierce drumming on Up and Adam, as well as the serpentine soprano solo on All Blues. This is a much more accessible set than it might seem, with strong tunes and superior delivery all round."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
