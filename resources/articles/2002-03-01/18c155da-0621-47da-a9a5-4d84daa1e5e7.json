As part of a drive to improve work/life balance in the public sector, the Department for Trade and Industry is working closely with all government departments, and in particular the departments for health and education and skills, which have launched studies of their own. In a move designed to make job-sharing a more widely accepted practice, the first ever national guidance for schools and local education authorities about job sharing is to be issued in the next couple of months. That could be followed by a web-based job-share register to match candidates seeking job share \"partners\" in different areas. Speaking to the Unions 21 Conference in London today, Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt will stress the importance of more flexible working arrangements, particularly for women. \"I'm very clear about the importance of working time reform to individuals, to families and to organisations. When women are nearly half the workforce, enabling people to balance work and the rest of their life isn't just a good thing to do, it's essential. \"We all want working hours that suit us individually. We also want working hours that meet our needs as consumers. And if we want to be more demanding as consumers, we need more flexible workplaces too.\" Ms Hewitt will single teaching out as a profession where there is great scope for more flexibility, particularly at a time when recruitment and retention continue to be a major problem in all parts of the country. \"The teaching profession has been unfairly treated in some parts of the press,\" she will say. \"Too often the perception is one of long holidays and a short school day, but we know in reality teachers work longer hours per week than the average for all employees. Teachers and headteachers work more intensive weeks than other comparable managers, and professional and headteachers' own workloads are higher than average - by some 300-400 hours a year. \"As we all know, our teachers do a tremendous job in often difficult circumstances and the long hours culture certainly doesn't help. This is why, working jointly with the DfES, we are committed to promoting flexible working. In the private sector we are promoting flexible working because it helps companies improve their productivity and retain skilled staff. The same is true in the public sector. \"By promoting job sharing and part-time working we are more likely to retain skilled teachers and that will have a knock-on effect on standards.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
