It wasn't easy, and it always hurts, but it seemed much more straightforward.\" Fifteen days ago, on 19 July, Payne won the 10km open-water race at the world championships, and a gold medal for Britain that was eventually matched by her room-mate in Shanghai, Rebecca Adlington, who triumphed in the 800m freestyle. Adlington's victory was riveting but Payne established herself as an emerging star of British swimming by winning an event that can be as brutal as it is raw, as dangerous as it is surreal. Payne coolly details some of her more challenging races over the years, laughing dryly at the memory of stinging sea-creatures, floating animal corpses, menacing shadows lurking in the dark waters below as well as the heavy blows and bloodied noses she has absorbed as a routine part of her lonely trade as a long-distance swimmer. More hysterical observers have compared the gruelling 10km to a form of \"underwater boxing\" \u2013 for roundhouse swings and busted lips occur often as a packed bunch of swimmers fight their way towards the supposed sanctuary of clear water. Bruising physical contact is usually inadvertent \u2013 but open-water swimmers are sometimes accused of deliberately trying to hold each other back either through an intentional swipe or grasp of an ankle. Yet, apart from the seething competition, less human shapes exude a grisly fascination for followers of this strange event, where it is often hard to pick out which capped head belongs to which pain-riddled swimmer as they plough through choppy seas or murky rivers. \"There have been some good stories along the way,\" the 23 year-old Payne says. \"My first world championships were in Melbourne in 2007 \u2013 and it was only my second open-water swim. We'd been out there the previous December and there was nothing suspicious in the water. But a few months later we returned and on the afternoon before the race it was pretty freaky. We looked down into the sea and there were these huge jellyfish.\" On closer inspection it turned out that each jellyfish was around the size of a large dinner plate. \"They were that big,\" Payne says laconically, before admitting that she suffered a mild panic attack. \"It was not good for a while but I had that epiphany. I told myself that if I pulled out, someone stronger would take my place. So I decided there and then to do it. It made me realise that, with the 10k, you are going to be tested. Questions will be asked as to how strong you are and how much you want it. I swam the next day \u2013 but so did everyone else. I was leading for a long way but inexperience kicked in. There were feeding stations and I took on some food at the wrong time. I learned from that.\" A year later, in Hong Kong, Payne was spooked to be swimming on the wrong side of the shark nets. \"I thought we'd be swimming on the safe side, but they said they'd only seen one shark in 10 years. I wouldn't say I've got a phobia of sharks, but I guess it's more the unknown that freaks you out.\" Payne was tested again that year, just before the 2008 Beijing Olympics, when she swam in a race down the Xin Jinhe river in Shantou, China. \"There were dead animals in the river. They were mostly dogs but some were horses. We swam in the middle and they were along the edge. It's a funny story now, but open-water swimming is like that and you have to deal with it.\" A few months later Payne led the Olympics for 9,950m \u2013 before being overtaken in the last 50m by a Russian rival, Larisa Ilchenko. Payne was still justifiably proud of her silver medal. But in a less significant race the following summer she felt less gratified when plunging into the Hudson in New York. The dirty water was so churned up by passing tourist boats that she could barely see anything \u2013 which explained why she was hit so often in the face by rivals. She finally crawled over the finish line, with a bleeding nose and scant vision, as darkness descended. Last year Payne arrived in Quebec as the world champion, after she had won the 2009 race in Rome. \"Quebec was my biggest disappointment,\" she says. \"The lake was freezing and I much prefer warm water. As athletes our tools are our hands. And as soon as I lose the feeling in my hands my stroke is not as good and I don't reach as far because I can't feel the water. That's what happened in Quebec. I couldn't capture the water.\" Shanghai, in contrast, offered water that, at 29 degrees, was only two degrees below a temperature considered unsafe for swimming. \"I'd still take that over cold water every time. But if Quebec is at one extreme and Shanghai at the other, then the water temperature in the Serpentine at 2012 is smack bang in the middle. The Serpentine is going to be perfect.\" Olympic organisers are already conditioning the Serpentine swans to feed in a stretch of water far from the open-water swimmers \u2013 and so Payne is likely to be spared an encounter with an irritable swan to place alongside her outlandish catalogue of open-water companions. She is also thrilled to have become the first name on an expected list of 550 British Olympic competitors next year. \"I don't think there can be a greater honour than representing your country at your home Olympics. It's fantastic just to do that \u2013 but to be the first to qualify makes it all the sweeter.\" Payne explains that the lure of Olympic qualification was always her primary objective in Shanghai: \"I was motivated by my disappointment in Quebec but the main thing was definitely securing that Olympic place. I like taking the lead early and swimming in a straight line, with the pace being dictated by me. Melissa Gorman [the Australian] hung with me for a while in the third lap. \"We were level when we rounded the buoy but she had a bad turn and fell behind. But there was a big gap between the leading three and the rest. It was something like 13 seconds, which is very unusual. So the last 1,000m was actually a relief because I thought there is no way 10 girls are going to pass me. I knew that I had qualified for the Olympics and that spurred me on to win it.\" Payne won in two hours, one minute and 58.1 seconds \u2013 and the race was sufficiently demanding that, despite being ranked at seven in the world in the 1500m, she failed to qualify for that final in the pool. \"I don't want to give any excuses, but fatigue was a factor. It takes a lot out of you \u2013 swimming two hours in the heat of midday \u2013 but next time we need to make the recovery process much better. We're learning every time and I'll be motivated by my not-so-brilliant 1500m when I start training again.\" She is so versatile that, in the British Gas national swimming trials this year, Payne finished third in the 200m freestyle \u2013 proving she is a sprinter as well as a marathon swimmer. Payne was part of the relay team in Shanghai and while the 1500m is not an Olympic discipline, she has the additional options of the 200m, 400m and 800m freestyle in 2012. \"I haven't decided what I might try for in the pool,\" Payne says, \"but the 800m most closely mirrors what I do in the open water. So that could be a brilliant Olympic dress rehearsal before the 10k. But out here [in Shanghai] I was thrilled for Becky when she won the 800m. It's been brilliant sharing with her. We get on really well and we're just as messy as each other. Everybody who comes into our room says: 'Oh, my goodness, how do you survive in this mess?' But we like it that way.\" Payne, like Adlington, is a relentless cheery voice on Twitter and there was no disguising her elation on the day she won in Shanghai as she tweeted: \"OH MY GOODNESS!!! World champion and I qualified for the 2012 Olympics and my sister is in labour right now!! Best day ever! Aaaahhhhhhhhh.\" \"My family had quite a time,\" she says now, \"and I think me and my sister gave my mother a few more grey hairs. My sister went into labour just before my race but she waited for me to win before she told my parents. The first I heard about it was when I got a text from my mum. I called [sister Janine] and we spoke because the baby wasn't born for another six or seven hours. I'm so much a family girl that I was more excited about that than becoming world champion again. \"It's all I've been thinking about the last couple of weeks, my sister having a lovely little baby girl, and when I get home I'm going to spend a night there. I'm not sure how much help I'll be but I'm going to try. After I've seen her I'll feel more settled and I'll be able to think about what I've accomplished, but at the moment it's all about them. \"And, after labour, which is much tougher than a 10k swim, my sister can definitely take the glory of having withstood much more pain than me.\" Keri-Anne Payne is an ambassador for British Gas which is supporting the GB swimming team to win more gold medals, as part of its partnership with the sport at all levels.
