And I'm not alone", "bodyText": "Was anyone else bemused by the findings of the polls after the final leaders' debate? Brown \u2013 third. Brown \u2013 last. Brown \u2013 trailing in behind the other two and quite possibly behind everybody else in the entire world, including serial killers and puppy stranglers. Really? Admittedly, post \"Bigotgate\", Brown looked terrible; gripping on to the podium, blotchy face rippling, he resembled none other than the corpse of Bagpuss. However, I thought he spoke well, certainly better than his opponents. Cameron quivered like a schoolboy who'd forgotten his times tables. As for Clegg \u2013 there may already be student drinking games based on his repetitive remarks (tequila shot for every time he says: \"Old politics\"; vodka chaser for: \"Political point-scoring\"). Did anyone else feel that Brown had been handed the third-place rosette before he even took to the podium? That, even before Brown screwed up with Gillian Duffy, everything he said and did, was to an accompaniment of abuse, insults and gloating \u2013 with Brown, the equivalent of a bull, determinedly trying to keep on its feet, despite a baying media crowd, and a back full of pollsters' spears. A \"Get Gordon\" bloodlust, which, in the end, was so obvious as to be foolish. After all, attack a guy often enough (for everything, for nothing) and it just may backfire and ignite the sympathy vote. I don't know a single person who's been asked their opinion for a poll. However, I do know quite a few people, many of them women, none of them ragingly partisan, who are quietly disgusted by the way Brown has been treated during this election. Sure, I've indulged in gallows humour with journalist friends: \"He's all wounded and donkey rescue centre-like, I can't bear it\"; \"I know, it's like holding the hand of a dying relative\". However, elsewhere, there seems to be an underlying sense of sympathy for Brown that oddly never makes it into the polls. \"Even if it's time for him not to be prime minister, he seems like a decent man, and it's too much,\" said one woman. \"Would Cameron or Clegg have done any better with his hand, I doubt it,\" sniffed another. Indeed, for someone routinely depicted as \"irrelevant\", Brown gets talked about. A lot. Samantha Cameron can be as pregnant as she likes \u2013 women I've spoken to couldn't care less. Label it \"personality politics\" if you like, but it's the relentless baiting of Brown, and his answering stoicism, that is holding the interest right now. Which, of course, is genuinely \"female\". Always, at times such as these, the female vote (\"the Mumsnet factor\") is discussed as if it were a pink, fluffy silly thing \u2013 with women needing to be courted, flattered and directed, or \u2013 bubbleheads that we are \u2013 we may go mad and vote for someone because he is wearing a shiny tie. A reductionist view that is as untrue as it is insulting. In truth, most women are clever and pragmatic creatures, perfectly capable of assessing the core issues and thinking for themselves. As of course are many Britons, male or female, who doubtless haven't been polled. These people don't really care if someone has flawed social skills and a \"smile\" like the opening of an old welly, so long as he seems essentially decent and committed. They don't appreciate being loftily instructed who to vote for. And they definitely don't like to see individuals baited beyond endurance \u2013 not teachers such as Peter Harvey (driven to violence by his pupils) or politicians such as Gordon Brown. That's why in an election full of surprises, I'm wondering whether there might be one more big surprise yet \u2013 if all that extraordinary \"Get Gordon\" abuse, may yet backfire, particularly in terms of the refusenik female vote. If his enemies have inadvertently turned Gordon Brown into Heathcliff, they only have themselves to blame. Who wants to live in John Lewis land? Excuse me if I'm interrupting you blubbing into your cereal bowl at the new 91-second John Lewis advert. With a budget of \u00a36m, it features Fyfe Dangerfield singing Always a Woman over footage of a woman's life, confusingly sprinkled with modern John Lewis products. It's from birth through to old age, though thankfully they don't show John Lewis Woman gasping her last or being dumped in an urn by the Dignitas clinic. Hundreds of thousands have now viewed it on YouTube and many say they've been moved to tears. Others go to the remote control to turn off what must be the ultimate director's cut of Middle England smuggery. Talk about It's a Wonderful (Cath Kidston) Life. Going by other news stories last week, the real-life version of John Lewis Woman would more likely end up depressed, divorced, buying herself saucy lingerie or catching chlamydia from some rotter she met in a wine bar. However, John Lewis doesn't want you thinking about such nastiness or, as the rest of us know it, real life. Everyone in the advert glides about looking well laundered, self-satisfied, respectable and altogether like people whose Le Crueset ramekins you wouldn't mind smashing over their heads. Then again, why shouldn't John Lewis make adverts for its target clientele? No one accused Iceland of working-class smuggery when it hired Kerry Katona to rave it up over the frozen cocktail sausages. Still, isn't it tragic that this sub-1950s wish-fulfilment is still going strong? What are all those nostalgic John Lewis customers hankering after exactly? Drying with mangles? Rickets? So enjoy the ad, but remember \u2013 life was never like that, it isn't like that now and it won't ever be. There, I bet some of you are crying for real now. Is Elba able to play a god? Haven't you seen him in The Wire One notes that black actor Idris Elba (The Wire's \"Stringer\" Bell), is under fire for being cast in the Kenneth Branagh, Marvel comic-inspired film Thor, as Heimdall, the \"whitest of the gods\". Elba has said his Heimdall is \"Norse, by way of Hackney\" and has praised the casting as a positive step. Meanwhile, Marvel comic fans are fuming, saying its political correctness gone mad. What nitpicking ninnies. Anyone who's seen The Wire knows that Elba can do god-like. (You wouldn't chuck him off Mount Olympus for eating crackers.) And hello! Heimdall is a god, a mythical being, all made up and everything, so it's a bit odd to get hung up on what he should look like. Examples of the reverse of racially flexible casting are legion. Could Middle Eastern Jesus Christ really have resembled Robert Powell? Was Cleopatra a dead ringer for Elizabeth Taylor? Not to mention Othello, played by countless blacked-up white guys. The comic purists should stop whingeing. Do they really want Elba to white up or should we all just shut up, sit back and admire the guy's acting ability?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
