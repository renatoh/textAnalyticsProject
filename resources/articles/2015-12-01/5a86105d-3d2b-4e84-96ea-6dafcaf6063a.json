She made Lena Dunham a fangirl. She sang arm in arm with Kate McKinnon. And in her latest attempt to appeal to millennial women, Clinton will appear alongside comedy\u2019s hottest stars Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer on their show, Broad City. Clinton broke the news by posting a photo of herself with the show\u2019s stars and Amy Poehler, an executive director. The show\u2019s Twitter account also released a photo that showed a frame of Clinton on the Broad City set with Jacobson and Glazer. In the frame, Clinton is almost glowing as sun beams through a stained-glass window of her campaign logo. Is she trying to match the show\u2019s Oprah mosaic wall art? \u201cJust three best friends on the set of @BroadCity season 3!\u201d read the caption. Clinton is counting on women and millennials for support, which seems like a natural fit. But her rabble-rousing challenger, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, has been peeling away some of the youth vote. A recent NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll found that young voters between the ages of 18 and 29 favored Clinton\u2019s rival by a margin of 48% to her 33%. As for Clinton\u2019s appearance on the show, there are few details. Will she play herself or take on a new character? Will Poehler impersonate her like old times? Clinton shined as Val the Bartender opposite her doppelg\u00e4nger on SNL. Poehler \u2013 as erstwhile parks administrator Leslie Knope on Parks and Recreation \u2013 once called her \u201cthe strongest, smartest punching bag in the world\u201d. (Knope also kept a framed photo of the former first lady in her office.) The show\u2019s third season debuts on 17 February on Comedy Central."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
