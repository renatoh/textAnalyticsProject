Chariot, which operates the charity-focused lottery Monday as a competitor to the National Lottery, was forced to seek further funds after selling just 1.7m tickets in its first four weeks. The company yesterday said it had raised \u00a32.7m through a placing of 53m shares at 5p, which would ease working capital concerns. Chariot said it would reduce costs and seek greater marketing support from its 70 charity partners."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
