PR STUNTED The Backbencher was intrigued to find that the British army is currently advertising a photographic competition on the front page of its website. The judges will be looking for \"images with PR potential\", indeed the timing couldn't be better. There are a number of categories to choose from - including a \"portfolio of eight mono or colour photographs with an Army theme to show versatility, creativity, composition and visual impact.\" You can even do a Piers Morgan and use Photoshop to achieve the effect you want in the Best Digital Award category. There's no mention of the Geneva convention in the rules - but as the PMOS told journalists today, let's not \"get hypothetical\" about whether the guys are breaching international law. UV BEEN FRAMED Last week's Backbencher scoop on Kilroy's new home was confirmed by the Telegraph on Monday. Now doubts are beginning to creep in. Could the permatan be taking his europhobic friends for a ride? Veritas, after all, is Satire and an upside-down V sign. Still, Kilroy has never been known for his subtlety, and the Backbencher's mole confirms that Vanitas will be launched tomorrow evening at Hinckley golf club near Leicester. The permatan has apparently appointed Dr Jonathan Lockhart, formerly one of the blue men at the New Party, as his chief executive - which may lead to a minor conflict of interest, as the Electoral Commission lists the Doctor as the leader of the Commonwealth Party. Readers may also note the striking resemblance its emblem bears to the insignia of various SS divisions. Still, that needn't be a setback. Plenty of important people are taking an interest in Nazi emblems these days. SPY GEORGE Meanwhile, deep inside the new Labour-Tory frontier - or the Starbucks Victoria Street, as readers might know it - George Osborne, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, was spotted buying a sandwich on Monday. Nothing odd about that, of course, except that George was so excited by Silky's tax cuts that he tried to pay for his lunch in euros. Now, the Backbencher knows how hard it can be for today's political jetsetters to keep track of their small change, especially in an iconic American coffee chain, and the value of the euro has been creeping up to nearly 70p. But given that George was a big player in the now-dormant New Europe campaign (\"europe yes. euro no\"), he really should know better.

FROM WESTMINSTER The Tory leader was quick off the mark in today's PMQs, says the Guardian's political editor, Michael White. \"The real issue today was tax and spending. Mr Howard said that in the 1997 and 2001 general elections, Labour promised not to raise either the standard or lower rate of income tax, and would they repeat that pledge? Surprise, surprise, Mr Blair said no and that we'd have to wait for the manifesto, but he counterattacked claiming the Tories had raised lots of taxes when in government and saying that Labour had actually lowered the standard rate. \"Mr Howard tried the same tactic on national insurance, and said independent economists thought Mr Brown would have to raise taxes after the election. Mr Blair said the experts were wrong. \"Sir Peter Gershon's review for Mr Brown last year found that GBP20bn could be cut out of the system, but that any more would damage frontline services. The Guardian's Whitehall correspondent, David Hencke, reports today that quite a lot of this is smoke and mirrors. Of the 84,000 jobs that Mr Brown has his eye on, many will be relocated elsewhere. A lot of savings would also be made through better procurement. \"Into an already murky picture comes David James' review for the Tories. He says that in fact we can cut up to GBP35bn and still have enough money to protect the health service and to cut taxes. I didn't think today's exchanges shed a great deal of light on the subject, except to underline that the James figures do seem rather fragile.\" UNLUCKY FOR ONE A reader emails about last week's item on ITV's lamentable Vote For Me. \"I know you Guardian types aren't sticklers for getting numbers right,\" she writes, inaccurately, \"but the constituencies that will be fought in 2005 number 646 - but surely even ITV wouldn't be so gauche as put up a candidate against the Speaker, so let's call it 645. Thirteen seats have been lost due to reorganisation in Scotland.\" The Backbencher stands corrected. The winner, Rodney Hylton-Potts - arguably ineligible to serve as an MP because of his stint in Brixton jail - has wasted no time in establishing a website, VoteRodders.org, and has announced his intention to stand against Silky in Folkestone and Hythe. YOUR CROWNING MOMENT MPs who have never quite been able to decide between royalty and republic - in other words, much of the Labour party - really ought to back the Tory MP Jonathan Sayeed's 10-minute rule bill to give the Commons a vote on who should succeed the Queen. Of course, they won't. But if Britons were ever allowed to choose their own monarch from the royalty on offer, who would take the crown? Cast your vote - it's the only chance you'll get, and at the time of writing the Afrika Korps impersonator had taken the lead. KNOW YOUR PLACE Are you feeling in a Daily Mail mood? Need reassurance about your place on the social scale, or confirmation of the size of the tax burden you have to shoulder? Then the Institute for Fiscal Studies has just the thing. \"Here, just by answering a few short questions, you can find out where you lie in the Great Britain income distribution, and how many people are better or worse off than you,\" the IFS promises. Now, doesn't that feel better? LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION Entries for last week's competition poured in from as far afield as Saskatchewan, Sydney and Old Queen Street. The Backbencher asked readers to identify the event described here: \"Typically cold ... and often wet. Expect to be outside for more than three hours, to stand in line, and to walk for long periods of time ... Do not bring any food item larger than a small snack. Thermoses are prohibited.\" \"Is it instructions for following a fox hunt?\" wondered one reader. \"It sounds like a party round Gordon Brown's to me,\" suggested another. \"A canvassing session with the Tories in Folkestone.\" A further reader mentioned the queue for the number 73 bus in Stoke Newington. \" The prize, however, goes to a West Virginian reader who has actually endured several presidential inaugurations. \"The key is either to have a very pleasant companion or a good book, as one muct be in place literally hours before anything begins to happen,\" writes David John. Congratulations - your book will be on its way shortly. THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION It pains the Backbencher to write it, but the winner of Boris' Seventy-Two Virgins has failed to get in touch with their address. That means that she must, at all costs, get rid of the \"effortlessly brilliant page-turner\" (Telegraph) this week. So this week's competition is a pushover. Just identify one of the stars who turned out to perform at the America's Future Rocks inaugural concert yesterday. If you can tell her what they're famous for, then so much the better.
