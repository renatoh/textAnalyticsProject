An unrepentant Reed, reflecting on Friday\u2019s episode when he snapped his lob wedge over his knee after a fluffed chip, is struggling to see what all the fuss is about. \u201cAt the end of the day, I got my anger out; I didn\u2019t do anything to the golf course, I didn\u2019t say obscenities or anything like that,\u201d said the 2018 Masters champion. \u201cIt was a split second, I moved on and did my business, hit my next golf shot.\u201d Within minutes of Reed dismantling the club, adjacent to the 18th green at Pebble Beach, footage had gone viral. There is an assumption Reed will be fined for his fit of pique, although the tournament organisers never publicise the detail of such penalties. Not unreasonably, Reed used the aftermath of his third round on Saturday to point to indiscretions by his fellow professionals. Sergio Garc\u00eda seriously damaged putting surfaces in Saudi Arabia in February, in an episode which did affect other players in the field. \u201cYou have Sergio with what he did on the greens, I have seen multiple guys tear up golf courses and slam clubs,\u201d Reed added. \u201cRory [McIlroy] threw his club in the water on the 9th hole at Doral [in 2015]. Lucas Bjerregaard sent his driver into the water here. It happens. Things like that probably shouldn\u2019t happen but as long as you respect the golf course and aren\u2019t doing anything to damage it or the guys you are playing with\u2026 I\u2019d rather let it out than keep it in. \u201cTo me it is no big deal. It was comical watching it afterwards. It wasn\u2019t comical hitting poor wedge shot after poor wedge shot, especially when I pride myself on my wedge game. To miss the green from 20 yards then advance the ball three inches from 6ft off the green is not normally how my short game is. That\u2019s what a US Open and rough like this will do to you.\u201d For all Reed is in a position where he should be an example to youngsters, he is not at all prone to damaging equipment. He did draw criticism in China, five years ago, after branding himself a \u201cfucking faggot\u201d at the time of a missed putt; for which he was immediately remorseful. Reed at the time admitted he had \u201ctemper issues\u201d before adding: \u201cIt never should have happened. This game of golf, it\u2019s a gentleman\u2019s game.\u201d Handily, Reed carries three versions of the wedge in question to each tournament, meaning he had another one in his bag for a third round of 72. He labels the clubs, which have 61 degrees of loft, \u201c61 and done\u201d. Reed explained: \u201cUsually it gets me out of jail, it kept me in jail on that one. \u201cPlayers, even at this level and whether you are playing well or poorly, any time you hit a bad golf shot or find a really bad spot, you are always upset. You aren\u2019t going to be happy and smiling when you hit a bad golf shot, especially when you hit four in a row after a solid drive.\u201d The double bogey racked up by Reed at the hole in question meant he survived the halfway cut by only one shot. Saturday\u2019s round moved him to an aggregate of plus three, meaning he remains outside the US Open top 50 with 18 holes to play. In his previous four major starts before Pebble Beach, Reed had a best finish of tied 28th and two missed cuts. Frustration about the general state of his game is not difficult to trace. \u201cI knew [what the cut was] but I wasn\u2019t worried about the cut line,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not out here to just make cuts, I\u2019m out here trying to win golf tournaments. It didn\u2019t matter to me whether the cut was one over, two over, seven over. I was more upset about making double bogey on the last than just making a cut.\u201d Reed offered a smile when asked when he last snapped a club. \u201cIt happened three times last year; I got off commercial flights and there was a broken club in my bag,\u201d said the 28-year-old. \u201cI have no clue when I last did it.\u201d That he \u201cdid it\u201d here will linger as one of the abiding memories of the tournament."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
