Little more than a lofted drive down Williamstown Road from the alluring facade of Yarraville Oval, and a few blocks from Charles Street, where Australian cricket bat pioneers RM Crockett &amp; Sons once created their wares, the master bat-maker has been plying his trade for more than 20 years, crafting exquisite bats of Australian and English willow for discerning local batsmen. They could hardly miss Fisher\u2019s shop, clad on one side by a mural depicting the kind of bucolic club cricket scene hoped for each weekend by the clientele who\u2019ve made this pilgrimage across town for the past few decades. But Fisher Cricket Bats &amp; Willow will be a fixture of the Melbourne cricket community no more once its owner finalises the building\u2019s sale in the coming months. After 29 years artfully dragging his trusty draw knife across hand-selected clefts of willow, the bat-maker is shutting up shop and relocating his life and work to Camperdown in country Victoria. The reasons for this are manifold but predictable: Indian imports \u2013 whose makers are often paid as little as $2.50 a bat for their labour \u2013 have flooded the local market; Australian buyers are less discerning than ever but simultaneously more slavishly devoted to the brands promoted by international stars; appreciation for Fisher\u2019s back-breaking craftsmanship and painstaking selection of materials is almost nonexistent; and \u2013 crucially, he says \u2013 participation levels in the ranks of weekend-in, weekend-out club cricketers are thinning to levels unacknowledged in Cricket Australia\u2019s annual figures, bolstered as they are by 45-minute, plastic-bat T20 Blast sessions aimed at primary school children. Fisher is disappointed but philosophical that his decades-old business is no longer viable to the degree it once was. \u201cWages in India are not going to go up much, but [bat manufacturer\u2019s] profits are going to go up a huge amount,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ll shoot themselves in the foot eventually, but I\u2019m out of here. \u201cI\u2019ve had a gutful. It\u2019s a classic example of cheap labour allowing people to just corrupt the market. It\u2019s a manufactured product. It ain\u2019t high tech. They can get away with cheap labour and it becomes a game of attrition \u2013 who you can outlast. \u201cThey don\u2019t give the workers a fair cut, in my view.\u201d Poorer also will be the average club batsman if Fisher\u2019s concerns about the quality of what ends up in the hands of buyers bear out, and he says that his cynicism might soon be shared by the market. \u201cThe bats that come out of India, despite what anyone says \u2013 they bake them,\u201d he says. \u201cThey come in here, some of them are huge but they\u2019re quite dry because they\u2019re baked. \u201cMoisture in willow means weight. One per cent moisture is one ounce of weight. So if you can get 3% of moisture out of a bat in a hot Indian summer, you can have a bat that is very light. But they lose their fibrous integrity.\u201d In Melbourne, moisture content in bats is necessarily far higher. \u201cBat manufacturing has been happening in Melbourne since the 1860s and 1870s,\u201d Fisher says. \u201cBecause it\u2019s 11-14% [moisture content] through the winter, it gives integrity to the willow, but that means weight. \u201cIt\u2019s an arms race. They\u2019re selling on appearance rather than integrity. \u201cA lot of the Indian middle class are waking up to the idea that they\u2019re buying labels but they\u2019re not necessarily getting a good bat,\u201d he says, adding that every time a shipment of willow lands in India the big brands are skimming off the cream for high-profile clientele and sponsored players, whose numbers have now swelled beyond the ranks of top internationals. \u201cIt\u2019s about the professionals getting looked after. Those really high-quality bats don\u2019t hit the shops in India and certainly not in Australia. The Indian bats coming in here have been vetted.\u201d A decade ago Fisher had Test captains asking him to supply custom-made bats on which they\u2019d plaster their high-paying sponsor\u2019s stickers, and dozens of serious customers would walk through the door every day. Fisher sold four bats the day before my visit \u2013 decent enough \u2013 but in the hours I spend with him as the clock winds down on this Melbourne cricket institution of his, there\u2019s only one drop-in. Like most, he asks nothing about the quality of the bats themselves, focusing solely on their price tag. Yet at $500 to $600 for a custom-made bat shaped from the finest raw ingredients he would be paying $200 to $300 less than the retail price on an inferior blade plastered with a big-name brand. It seems that young Melburnians only have a thirst for artisan creations when it comes to raw smoothie bowls covered in chia seeds or double-shot turmeric lattes \u2013 plus Fisher says labels are everything. \u201cThey\u2019re very brand-oriented, yeah. They lose the brand orientation when they\u2019re about 25 or 30. Then they just want a good bat. \u201cThat\u2019s too late for me. I lose sales.\u201d Contrary to some reports, Fisher is not downing tools entirely but nor is he holding out hope of a reversal in his business\u2019s downward trend. Selling off his hybrid of retail store, workshop and home will enable him to simplify his life and get away from the rat race. He will continue to pursue a small but discerning clientele of older, hardcore club cricketers and customers who prize the intimacy of his service, the love and attention given to each bat and the understated beauty of the results. Each Fisher bat is a collaboration between maker and user, and worthy of that much-abused term \u201cbespoke\u201d. \u201cOccasionally you get guys in here in their 30s, 40s and 50s, and they really appreciate it,\u201d Fisher says. \u201cThey just cannot believe that someone is still doing this job. But I can tell you now that 90% of people who walk in the door couldn\u2019t give a stuff.\u201d Aside from a small, high-end custom range by the local industry heavyweight Gray Nicolls \u2013 whose master bat-maker Stuart Kranzbuhler still takes on assignments not limited to David Warner\u2019s infamously thick-edged \u201cKaboom\u201d blades \u2013 the import-heavy nature of the bat industry in Australia means that old-fashioned craftsmanship from the likes of Fisher and former Australian Test player Ian Callen is now heading the way of the eight-ball over. For his current lot Fisher is not bitter as such, but he might have reaped a little more reward for his dedication, skill and forward planning. Since the early 1990s he has been planting his own willow, thus accompanying his cricket bats from the cradle to the grave \u2013 a point brought home when one surveys the row upon row of his and other maker\u2019s bats lined up for repair. It\u2019s with a wry chuckle that he admits covering up the shortcomings of lesser craftsmen has at times kept his business afloat. He speaks with undimmed passion for planting and growing the raw materials he ends up using in his creations. Fisher\u2019s passion for his work is undimmed and he speaks with paternalistic pride of the bats he still creates, smiling as he recalls his unconventional start in the industry in 1988, when he answered a local newspaper advertisement: \u201cMan wanted to work in workshop.\u201d It had been posted by Colin Maddocks, of the famous Melbourne cricket family, who hired the graphic designer on the spot when he walked in to the Richmond workshop and said he \u201cliked the smell of the joint\u201d. By 1992 he was growing his own willow. A 10-week Churchill fellowship trip to the UK in 1996 allowed him to study many of the willow-growing methods he had basically picked up by himself anyway. With cuttings he grew in country Victoria he would approach farmers in carefully selected areas \u2013 often southern New South Wales or Gippsland in country Victoria \u2013 and plant his creations in the dead of winter, wherever there was a high moisture-content in the soil. On average, the buyers of cricket bats are not as sophisticated as they once were. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you,\u201d Fisher says, \u201cit\u2019s all price. \u2018What\u2019s your best price?\u2019 They couldn\u2019t give a fuck, most people. These things are hand made with a lot of love and a lot of craft and a lot of integrity towards the piece of wood you\u2019re being given. \u201cIt\u2019s not a simple matter of just knocking them out like golf clubs. You\u2019ve actually got to appreciate the weight of the willow, the performance of the willow, the style and the profile.\u201d Fisher has never used Facebook or Twitter, and pays no attention to the thriving culture of online reviews of his wares \u2013 a field of opinion as wide as it is shallow. His bats feature generous warranties and the rare customer who finds fault with his work can bring it back for adjustment. \u201cIt\u2019s all one-on-one,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m like a doctor. I don\u2019t jump to conclusions.\u201d Add to all that the physical toll extracted from the artisan. You have to be naturally strong to make cricket bats, and even then you\u2019ll still weather back pain, hip problems and the kind of acute tennis elbow that often demands days of rest. \u201cI used to shear sheep, so you just get used to the hard work,\u201d Fisher says. His best days for making bats are hot ones \u2013 an even 30C or so ideally \u2013 when he can work up a light sweat and loosen his battle-weary joints, thus achieving the mobility and rhythm of a man far younger than his 60 years. Dust masks and ventilation technology have also lessened the health problems experienced by some of his his forebears. At Crockett\u2019s down the road, Fisher says, old-timers like Harry Preston used to risk all sorts of health problems. A non-smoker, Preston eventually died from emphysema that was probably caused by the toxic fumes (\u201cthey had no extractors in those days\u201d) from the cane in the bat handles he made. Proving you\u2019re never too far from being brought full circle by cricket history, Fisher used to grow the cuttings used for his own willow in Daylesford, a former stomping ground of none other than Bob Crockett, the bat-maker and umpire once known as the \u201cchief justice of cricket\u201d, and the man whose pioneering willow plantation produced the first locally made bat to help an Australian to a Test hundred, scored by Warwick Armstrong. In the act of making a bat Fisher is as effortless and efficient in his movements as a world-class batsman but the ease with which he uses that draw knife is deceptive. Each stroke of the blade is precise but results from a sharp jerking motion that draws upon the entire upper body. Left behind on his work bench are thin willow shavings, which curl like the bows on Christmas presents. On a good day, when it\u2019s warm and he can get on a roll, Fisher turns out as many bats as he can stockpile and secretly hopes he\u2019s not interrupted. Today it\u2019s windy and bitterly cold. The vogue now is for thicker bats, so Fisher always hopes for the lightest willow possible, allowing him to \u201cleave them bigger\u201d, but he says the impact of size is overstated. \u201cBig bats don\u2019t necessarily play well. It\u2019s very simple: the moisture content in the bat means that they can shape them so they\u2019re big. Also it\u2019s the selection of the willow. \u201cYou can\u2019t make a light bat out of a heavy piece of willow. Maybe 25% of my willow is very light, so you\u2019d go through my bats and find some absolute monsters that are very light. But not everything can be done that way.\u201d \u201cMaking a monster bat doesn\u2019t mean to say it plays well. Warner and those sorts of guys are given the lightest of the lightest and the best of the best. It\u2019s light willow and good-performing willow. He\u2019s walking out with something that if you touch it, it\u2019s going to fly.\u201d On the contrary, Fisher says, he\u2019ll sometimes hear a shot played on TV and look up when he hears the thud of the ball on a bad piece of willow. This, he suggests, could partly explain the late-career form of Michael Clarke, whose bats Fisher didn\u2019t like the sound of towards the end of the Australian captain\u2019s playing days. \u201cWarner\u2019s bats have this beautiful deep sound but Clarke\u2019s sounded as hard as hell.\u201d Cricket bats simply evolve according to the trends of the day and always have, Fisher says. As well as thick edges, most contemporary bats have flat faces, a change the bat-maker himself has eschewed to the delight of many customers, who claim a better ability to \u201ctarget\u201d their strokes with his traditional, gently-curved faces as per the traditional English method employed for the best part of 200 years. He\u2019s cynical of moves to limit the thickness of bats. \u201cThey say the technology has changed,\u201d he scoffs. \u201cWell I\u2019ll tell you now. The three-spring cane handle was developed in England in the 1840s. The willow is the same tree. There\u2019s no technical changes at all. \u201cHuman beings are bigger. Wickets are probably more batsman-friendly and people train a lot harder. They\u2019re seeing the ball so early.\u201d In a number of respects, both Fisher\u2019s skill as a maker and his integrity as a businessman have left him worse off; owing to his exacting standards of willow selection and the superior skill in their making, his bats perform better but also last longer, so customers often use them for half a decade or more, shrinking their creator\u2019s revenue stream. He refuses to hoodwink unsuspecting buyers into paying top dollar for the lower-grade willow that inevitably crops up in his shipments. Those blocks are turned into half-price \u201cbowling machine bats\u201d, made with just as much skill but by Fisher\u2019s high standards more suitable for use at training. Throughout it all, the symbiotic relationship between craftsman and material is clear. \u201cI can look at a block of wood with a handle in it and say, \u2018I don\u2019t like you at all, I\u2019m not going to enjoy this at all,\u2019\u201d Fisher says, laughing. \u201cAnd then you can look at others and say, \u2018Geez I\u2019m going to enjoy this.\u2019 Some willow you don\u2019t enjoy because you\u2019re not going to sell it, basically.\u201d He point blank doesn\u2019t understand practitioners in any field who don\u2019t prize the tools of their trade. \u201cLook, I cut trees down so I\u2019ve got Husqvarna and Stihl chainsaws,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey never breakdown. They last. I don\u2019t buy cheap stuff. \u201cIf I was a very good batsman I would be sniffing around for a good bat. Pads, gloves and all that gear is not that important. But a cricket bat, you want to know that it\u2019s going to play well and have a warranty, and that it\u2019s going to be made to the balance you want. I don\u2019t want to labour the point, but there\u2019s no appreciation for that.\u201d No bat-maker in the world could claim a more holistic approach to his work, but the end of an era is nigh. \u201cIt is a shame but I\u2019m glad I\u2019m at my age now,\u201d Fisher says of his imminent downsizing. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be more one-on-one, and business and customers I enjoy. They get really well looked after and they\u2019re not paying retail prices like in the shops, they\u2019re paying $200 to $300 less.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no bat-makers in Australia anymore. There\u2019s bat importers, retailers and wholesalers, but there\u2019s just no appreciation at all.\u201d Not long before Lachlan Fisher sends me on my way, past a row of his lovingly created bats, I realise I haven\u2019t asked him an obvious question: what sort of cricketer was he himself? \u201cI was a tennis player,\u201d he says, laughing, before detailing the inevitable second coming as an obdurate opening batsman. \u201cI wasn\u2019t great at it but they couldn\u2019t get me out. \u201cNo bat-makers are good cricketers, I can tell you that now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
