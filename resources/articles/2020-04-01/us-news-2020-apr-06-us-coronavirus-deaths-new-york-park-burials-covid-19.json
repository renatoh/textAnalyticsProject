Confirmed cases in the US were approaching 340,000 as of Monday morning, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The death toll stood at 9,650. Many hospitals across the US were at capacity, and new hotspots or potential hotspots were springing up in every region. Maps of confirmed cases showed clusters from Atlanta to Nashville to Indianapolis \u2013 wherever there was a population center. Trump on Monday morning tweeted \u201cUSA strong!\u201d and \u201cLight at the end of the tunnel!\u201d in all capital letters. But new polling by the Public Opinion Research Lab at the University of North Florida indicated that voters in the key presidential election battleground state have lost trust in the president. A 53% majority of Floridians in the poll disapproved of Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis, and 58% said they did not trust Trump \u201cto provide reliable information about the coronavirus\u201d. Top administration officials issued a coordinated message at the weekend that the US was facing difficult weeks ahead. \u201cThis is probably going to be a very bad week,\u201d Dr Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s foremost infectious diseases expert, said. In New York City, the chair of the city council\u2019s health committee warned the morgues were almost full. \u201cSoon we\u2019ll start \u2018temporary interment\u2019,\u201d the councilman, Mark Levine, tweeted. \u201cThis likely will be done by using a NYC park for burials (yes you read that right). Trenches will be dug for 10 caskets in a line. It will be done in a dignified, orderly \u2013 and temporary \u2013 manner. But it will be tough for NYers to take.\u201d Levine later said the plan had not yet been put into motion. Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters: \u201cWe will have the capacity for temporary burials \u2013 that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say. \u201cI\u2019m not going into details. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great thing to be talking about.\u201d In the state capital, Albany, Andrew Cuomo distanced himself from the idea, saying he would not support such plans. Cuomo, the New York state governor, reported that the coronavirus death toll in the worst-hit US state had risen to 4,758 from around 131,000 cases, but added that the daily total of deaths had been \u201ceffectively flat for two days\u201d, representing a \u201cpossible flattening of the curve\u201d and an apex of the New York outbreak. \u201cIf we are plateauing, it is because social distancing is working,\u201d Cuomo said, announcing an extension of the \u201cNew York pause\u201d social-distancing guidelines to 29 April, which means schools and non-essential businesses must stay closed until that date. The governor also announced an increase in fines for not observing social distancing and spoke insistently about New Yorkers\u2019 duty to each other and to frontline healthcare professionals. Cuomo said the state government was applying to the Trump administration to have the USNS Comfort, a navy medical ship docked in New York, converted to taking Covid-19 patients. The temporary hospital set up by the army at the Javits convention centre in Manhattan has already been switched to coronavirus cases. Cuomo reported \u201canecdotal suggestions\u201d that hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug championed by Trump, was proving effective in clinical trials in the city. But he said definitive answers on the drug\u2019s use in coronavirus cases was \u201cweeks if not months\u201d away. Cuomo also said the New York healthcare system was operating at full stretch but did not for now need any more ventilators, key machines for people badly affected by the respiratory disease. \u201cThe people we lost are the people we couldn\u2019t save,\u201d he said. As states continued their struggle to obtain ventilators and other life-saving medical equipment, the California governor, Gavin Newsom, whose state had some success at fighting off an early wave of the epidemic, said California would loan 500 \u201cstate-ownded ventilators\u201d to other states. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever we are the UNITED States of America,\u201d Newsom tweeted. \u201cI know, if the tables were turned, other states would be there for us.\u201d The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed tentatively in morning trading, but with millions filing for unemployment each week, a former chair of the federal reserve said the economy could sink into depression. \u201cThis is a huge, unprecedented, devastating hit, and my hope is that we will get back to business as quickly as possible,\u201d the former chair of the Federal Reserve Janet Yellen told CNBC. But she said the unemployment rate was probably as high as 13% and gross domestic product was down at least 30%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
