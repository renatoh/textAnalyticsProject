Lynsay Coventry, 54, who worked at the Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow in Essex, died on Thursday, the first publicly confirmed death of a serving NHS midwife in England linked to Covid-19. Liz Glanister, a staff nurse at Aintree University hospital in Liverpool, died on Friday. Coventry\u2019s family paid tribute to her as a \u201cvery well-respected midwife\u201d, adding: \u201cOur hearts are broken at the loss of our loving, wonderful and caring mum, sister, daughter and grandmother. We each know how much she loved and cherished us. Her love for us all was unfailing and her strength in the way she cared and supported us will fill our memories.\u201d Coventry\u2019s family said she had trained as a midwife later in life to \u201cfollow her dream\u201d. She \u201csaw the midwifery team at the Princess Alexandra hospital as her other family\u201d, the family statement said, noting how proud she was of her work. She had worked at the hospital for a decade. Lance McCarthy, the chief executive of the hospital\u2019s NHS trust, said Coventry would be remembered \u201cfor her professionalism and commitment to the women she supported\u201d, adding: \u201cHer loss will be felt by the maternity team and colleagues from across the organisation.\u201d He said Coventry had self-isolated after developing symptoms and had not been at work in the time before her death. Gill Walton, the chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Midwives, said Coventry\u2019s death was \u201cnot only a tragedy for her family, friends and colleagues, but also for all the women and children she touched during her career\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that the NHS frontline doesn\u2019t only apply to those working in intensive care or direct Covid support, but to midwives and others. Today we mourn the loss of Lynsay. Help us honour her life by doing what you can to reduce the impact of this pandemic and stay at home.\u201d Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, the chief midwifery officer for England, said: \u201cI was deeply moved and saddened to hear about the death of Lynsay Coventry. Lynsay was clearly a highly regarded midwife whose dedication to women, babies and their families will be remembered and cherished by her own family and her colleagues.\u201d She said the most fitting way to support NHS staff such as Coventry was to stay at home during the outbreak. Glanister\u2019s death was confirmed by the Liverpool University hospitals NHS foundation trust chief nurse, Dianne Brown. \u201cIt is with great sadness that I can confirm that Liz Glanister, a long-serving staff nurse at Aintree University hospital, sadly passed away at the Royal Liverpool University hospital on Friday after being tested positive for Covid-19,\u201d she said. \u201cAll our thoughts are with Liz\u2019s family at this time and we offer them our sincere condolences. Liz will be sadly missed by all those who knew and worked with her.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
