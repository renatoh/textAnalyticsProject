The Croatia international has made an encouraging start to this campaign in a Liverpool defence that has yet to concede a Premier League goal. A fourth consecutive clean sheet at home to West Ham United on Saturday would equal the club\u2019s record from the start of a league campaign, achieved a decade ago. Lovren struggled for form following his \u00a320m arrival from Southampton last summer and to secure a regular place alongside Martin Skrtel with competition from Mamadou Sakho. However, the 26-year-old has responded well to being told he would be first choice in pre-season and Rodgers admits psychology, plus the team\u2019s defensive structure, is behind Lovren\u2019s improvement. The Liverpool manager said: \u201cLike a lot of players it was always difficult that first year coming in. There was a lack of stability in the group and it was a case of reassuring him that he was still a top-quality player. \u201cWhat has really helped him is how quickly the full-backs close the game down when we lose the ball. In those situations [Nathaniel] Clyne and [Joe] Gomez really help the centre-backs. But for Dejan, he\u2019s much more patient in his game now, he\u2019s got the stability of playing. He\u2019s in the team and he\u2019s in because he had a good pre-season so he\u2019s in good condition. He\u2019s focused but he\u2019s also a bit more relaxed in his position.\u201d Lazar Markovic will become the fourth of nine players who joined Liverpool last summer to leave during this transfer window when he completes a season-long loan to Fenerbahce. But Rodgers says there was never a question of Lovren increasing that damning statistic. \u201cI spoke to him on that last season and told him it would be a great learning year for him,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course your confidence can be affected but he\u2019s continued to work very hard and he listens and learns. He knows he\u2019s still got to improve elements of his game but you\u2019re seeing that confidence and that stature he has and over the course of the season you will see a different player.\u201d Rodgers said Liverpool will not be active on transfer deadline day having signed seven players this summer, although the club still wishes to offload Fabio Borini and Jos\u00e9 Enrique. Liverpool have resisted approaches for Sakho since the \u00a319m defender lost his place to Lovren and Didier Deschamps, the France coach, has said he dropped the centre-half from his squad to face Serbia and Portugal next month due to his predicament at Anfield. Rodgers said: \u201cThat never concerns me. I always have respect for the player and I understand the situation. If you look at Mamadou\u2019s competition for France, you\u2019ve got Varane, Koscielny and Mangala. \u201cIf you want to be playing international football, ideally you want to be playing in your club team but I can\u2019t affect that. All I can say is that for now Mama\u2019s an important part of our squad. At the moment he\u2019s not in the team but he\u2019s working hard in training and hopefully looking to do everything he can to ensure that when the chance does come, because invariably it does, he\u2019s ready to take it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
