You may be surprised how beneficial it can be to see your colleagues in a different light and away from the daily stresses of the office. Socialising with colleagues can be the key to building positive relationships at work. Relaxed social settings are perfect for team building and colleagues from a strong team are likely to be happier at work, have better team-working skills and stay in their jobs for longer. Why not find out if this is actually what your team wants? It may be that so many social events are getting tiresome and the team may have felt obliged to attend nights out in the past. Ask someone in the team to conduct a poll to discover if this level of social activity is required. If your colleagues thrive on the social scene, set up an entertainment committee to give them some control over the type of social events to organise. There is no need for you to attend every time but do try to support these events. And go to one or two, who knows, you might even enjoy yourself! \u00b7 Linda Mortimer is HR director at Intelligent Finance Shaun Tyson says: Your predecessor sounds like Ricky Gervais's character David Brent from the BBC series The Office. As the new boss, the staff may find your more business-like approach refreshing. However, you may wish to capitalise on the informal and presumably friendly atmosphere you have inherited, for example by celebrating successes during office hours, when a target is achieved, or a big order is won. Even quite low key celebrations (eg special tea and cakes at a break time, with a symbolic gift to the high achiever) can have a very positive effect. You could meet with people who report to you directly for a working lunch, say once a week, to munch exotic sandwiches and get to know each other's perspective on common problems, as a part of team building. For anyone who doesn't like this idea, you could, of course, threaten the return of karaoke evenings... \u00b7 Professor Shaun Tyson is director of the human resources research centre at Cranfield University. Olwyn Burgess says: By the very nature of the work, sales and marketing people are usually very extrovert and spontaneous people so you should not be too surprised at their enthusiasm for embracing the work hard, play hard philosophy. This also sounds like a young team which is not tied down to the family commitments that would restrict the impromptu nature of the social events. Your challenge is to find a compromise that suits you as well as the team. If you feel forced to take part in these activities it will be obvious to all that you are not enjoying yourself and that may restrict their enjoyment too. However, I would imagine the social aspect is such an integral part of their work life that it will continue with or without you. You obviously don't want to be seen as a killjoy but your social life outside work is very important to you. Is there another solution? If your predecessor was the life and soul of the party, the team may need some sort of replacement to keep the momentum going. One suggestion I would make is to get a few of the team together - you will instinctively know who to involve - and seek their opinion. Is it possible to form some sort of informal social committee to take the lead in ensuring the social activities continue? Can you secure a small budget to kick-start it? Is there a compromise that would suit you all? You could organise a quarterly team day which would be a mixture of business (reviewing the performance of the company, the team, celebrating individual successes etc), team-building activities (treasure hunts, quizzes, fun competitive events) followed by an evening social event. You would not have to stay for the whole evening, but show willing for part of it. This type of event would show the team you can have fun and the team would feel more involved in the business. By consulting key members of the team you will get a steer as to what would work best for them and you. \u00b7 Olwyn Burgess is associate director at Hudson Human Capital Solutions"}, "isHosted": false}}}
