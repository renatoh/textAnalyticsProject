When Benee swaggers across the stage of Auckland\u2019s Spark Arena, she may as well be the only pop star in the world: live music recently resumed in her native New Zealand. More concert-deprived, homebound fans watch enviously via livestream. \u201cStuff like that, I choose not to overthink,\u201d 20-year-old Stella Bennett says of the magnitude of the event, speaking over Zoom two weeks later. \u201cI\u2019m already a huge fretter.\u201d (In her broad \u201cNu-Zild\u201d accent, it sounds like \u201cfritter\u201d; Benee, meanwhile, is pronounced \u201cBenny\u201d.) Her national tour narrowly missed disruption from a localised lockdown that ended a few weeks earlier. \u201cEveryone is just so amped to be back at gigs,\u201d she says. \u201cIt had this weird kind of new gig energy. I thought people would be really drunk, and some of them were, but a lot of them were just so focused.\u201d An established star at home, Benee\u2019s October homecoming should have been the triumphant cap to smaller jaunts around the US and Europe that were, inevitably, cancelled. The pandemic stalled her progress and forced her to move back into her parents\u2019 Auckland home. Yet it also created the context for her breakout hit. Earlier in the year, her self-deprecating, breezily downbeat single Supalonely had taken off as a TikTok dance challenge. One day in February, three months after release, its newfound virality prompted a 400% increase in streams. After the lyrics \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m a lonely bitch!\u201d \u2013 became newly relevant in lockdown, it continued to climb: Supalonely spent 17 weeks in the UK charts, peaking at No 18 in mid-April. Benee was still \u201cpretty gutted\u201d about her cancelled plans. \u201cWith music, it\u2019s like you\u2019re selling yourself: if people like this, and they like you, then you want to make them think that you\u2019re worth staying for,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat happened to me with TikTok, it is kind of scary because it\u2019s like: Shit, maybe I didn\u2019t want this to happen right now, maybe I\u2019ll get forgotten.\u201d But by forcing almost all performance and press opportunities online, the pandemic brought the world to Benee. She made her US television debut from Auckland, performing for Ellen DeGeneres and Jimmy Fallon, and collaborated remotely with Grimes, Lily Allen and the rapper Flo Milli. \u201cSometimes I feel a little bit guilty,\u201d she says. \u201cThis year has been so hectic, and so horrible for so many people; it feels weird for me because it\u2019s been the biggest year so far of my career. It feels very weird to celebrate anything when the world is literally falling apart.\u201d There is an endearing goofiness and intimacy to Benee that feels like a tonic in this doomed year (and which distinguishes her from the major-label pop stars desperately trying to go viral on TikTok). Advised to follow up Supalonely\u2019s smash with a \u201crelatable\u201d song, she instead wrote one called Snail, sung from the perspective of her favourite animal. She is entertaining company, even at a remove of 12,000 miles and 13 hours\u2019 time difference, speaking in slang (\u201cnext-level shooketh\u201d \u2013 meaning shocked) and revealing her self-doubt in a way that feels true of a new twentysomething. On World Mental Health Day, Benee shared seven photos of herself crying to show her 560,000 Instagram followers that \u201cmost people feel shit sometimes\u201d. It is important to her that her fans get to know her beyond her breakout hits and music videos. \u201cI would rather them know exactly what I\u2019m about, and that I\u2019m actually\u201d \u2013 she searches for the right word \u2013 \u201can idiot, and just normal, and from New Zealand, and don\u2019t take myself too seriously.\u201d In New Zealand, there is less pressure for pop stars to fit a \u201ccertain mould\u201d, Benee says. Naturally, some have made cheap comparisons between Benee and other young, female pop stars. But if she is anything like Billie Eilish, as some headlines have suggested, it\u2019s that she shares that musician\u2019s irreverent approach to presentation: Benee often performs in cat ears, cargo pants and a spacesuit, and was disgusted by the recent social media body-shaming of Eilish. \u201cI\u2019ve never been someone who likes to put her body out there anyways,\u201d she says. And while she was frustrated to be dismissed early on as a \u201cknock-off Lorde\u201d, she envies how her countrywoman has balanced celebrity and anonymity. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t been active on her Instagram for, like, a year, but she\u2019s still relevant.\u201d But being successful in a small country has sometimes left Benee feeling exposed. Early this year, two men tailed her home in their car, she says. \u201cI\u2019m sure it was completely harmless, but at the same time, it was also fucked up.\u201d More recently, she has caught people speculating about her location on Instagram and filming her in public. She was already inclined towards paranoia. For the past four years, says Benee, \u201cI\u2019ve had this feeling that there\u2019s someone outside, watching me; waiting for me to go to sleep so they can, like, take me in the night.\u201d She laughs self-consciously. Her fear of abduction is the subject of Night Garden and Monsta: breezy songs set to unsettling lyrics. On Happen to Me, she frets about the possibility of dying in a plane crash or house fire. Determined to stop having to ask her mum to come and sleep on her bed, she saw a psychologist and pushed pause on horror films and \u201cfreaky stuff\u201d. She now sleeps through the night, with the help of her new lockdown puppy: \u201cAs long as I have her on my bed every night, I\u2019m actually OK.\u201d Although Benee should have spent the year abroad, weathering the pandemic in New Zealand made her feel safe: prime minister Jacinda Ardern\u2019s response to the virus was recently ranked the best in the world. \u201cIt must be so scary having someone like frickin\u2019 Trump or Bolsonaro leading your country,\u201d she says. Benee had her first real brush with controversy before New Zealand\u2019s election last month when a clip of her calling Judith Collins \u2013 the leader of the conservative National party, and Ardern\u2019s political opponent \u2013 a \u201cbitch\u201d on stage in Wellington provoked headlines. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t have called another woman a bitch,\u201d she says, somewhat unconvincingly, \u201cbut in this case, it was me not agreeing with someone\u2019s politics. And when you are a musician, you can say whatever you want.\u201d Election night itself coincided with Benee\u2019s tour finale in Auckland. She paused the show to celebrate a historic win for Ardern and for Chl\u00f6e Swarbrick, the 26-year-old Green party wunderkind who is Benee\u2019s local MP. \u201cGuts [gutted] if you voted different,\u201d she said with a shrug. The crowd gave little indication that they had. She counts on her fans to share her beliefs. \u201cWhat I say is for people in the crowd, it\u2019s not for anyone at home,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s something comforting when I\u2019m at a gig. I feel like I can say anything because these people \u2026 we\u2019re here for each other, you know?\u201d \u2022 Hey u x is released on Island on 13 November"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
