Is it getting harder for artists who are starting out to find small places to tour? Natasha Khan (Bat for Lashes): I started out in Brighton in 2006, and at that time there were still a lot of cool little indie record shops and small underground venues. Almost all those record shops are now gone and the venues \u2026 I feel like now they have to have a cinema or put on other kinds of events. There are fewer of those shows that promoters would put on with your friends, where you\u2019d make posters yourself. Maybe that whole DIY thing has been undermined by the instantaneous social media thing. Joe Talbot (Idles): We played for nine years before we got any recognition, doing those kind of warm-Carlsberg-and-50-quid shows as much as possible. We were pissing into the wind at the start, because guitar music was bloated and cocaine-fuelled and there were lots of rubbish bands around, so people were moving on to more interesting subcultures. We were OK playing to 20 people; we knew the music we wanted to make. But all those venues we played are gone. Because of the triple recession and a government that\u2019s not interested in the arts, there\u2019s no subsidy for culture. I do not envy bands starting out now \u2013 incrementally, it\u2019s got worse and worse. Jayda G: It\u2019s been a huge issue in dance music, too. I\u2019m originally from Vancouver, and Europe seemed like a kind of utopia: \u2018Oh, they have a completely different dance culture.\u2019 And then I got here and I realised it\u2019s the same thing. The arts and culture isn\u2019t properly funded. It\u2019s interesting what Natasha said about putting out flyers. There still needs to be an element of that, because you bring people together in a different way than if it\u2019s just through Facebook or Instagram \u2013 it\u2019s about getting that one person who wouldn\u2019t know about what you\u2019re playing and then thinks: \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll check that out.\u2019 Will Young: Record companies put more power into social media than is actually there as a promotional tool. They\u2019re always getting you to make another video \u2013 \u201cHi! I\u2019m on tour in Torquay!\u201d \u2013 and I think it just gets lost in the white noise. But, with venues, I think with every action there\u2019s a reaction. I\u2019ve seen a lot of London venues close or be threatened \u2013 Fabric, Royal Vauxhall Tavern, other famous LGBTQ+ spaces like the Black Cap. But I think, up north, they\u2019ve found old buildings that are dilapidated, that they can get cheap, and have created amazing spaces for young people. In London, people would just automatically turn them into \u00a3260m-worth of flats. Rebecca Taylor (Self Esteem): There\u2019s a gulf that\u2019s getting bigger, between your Sheerans and your Capaldis doing arenas and someone like me. I\u2019ve got a fanbase, but I\u2019m stuck for somewhere to play. Even in Sheffield, where I\u2019m from, I had to play two nights in a small place, because there\u2019s no middle ground. You\u2019re still playing the places where there\u2019s no mirror and you have to get changed in the bogs. It makes you feel: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not successful.\u2019 JT: It\u2019s fundamental for any government to see the importance of funding the arts. Without getting overly lefty for the sake of it, the point is that governments do not want a congregation of free-thinking people to come in and spend their money how they want; [governments] want you to spend your money how they do. I think there\u2019s a big DIY culture; there\u2019s a lot going on in Bristol, raves being put on in arts centres and cafes and cinemas, people realising that obvious spaces aren\u2019t available, so thinking: \u201cFuck it, we\u2019ll do it here.\u201d That always comes around: cooperation in communities, building something. In February, R Kelly was charged with 10 counts of sexual abuse; further charges followed in May and August. Ryan Adams has also been accused of emotional abuse and sexual misconduct, while the Michael Jackson documentary Leaving Neverland had an explosive effect on his legacy. Has music finally had its #MeToo moment? WY: There\u2019s a musician I\u2019ve worked with who\u2019s been on tour with someone very well-known, and [the well-known person] abused them, verbally and with inappropriate behaviour. The musician didn\u2019t say anything, because they\u2019ve got kids and they don\u2019t want to lose the gig. That gave me an insight into it. The power is still there. It\u2019s about money. No one came to that person and offered them some aid, and I was really saddened by that. RT: It\u2019s an unregulated industry. Even at my level, I\u2019ve still got to smile and nod at shit I don\u2019t want to. Lily Allen spoke out about it [being sexually assaulted] and said she\u2019d lost loads of gigs as a result. I even worry about how much I\u2019ve spoken out. But then I go: \u201cI\u2019m not who I think I am if \u2026\u201d Things that have happened to me are bad, but nothing compared with things that have happened to some people. I did a songwriting thing for young girls, all around 16, and the whole angle was: \u201cI had to do this, but you\u2019re growing up in a brave new world where men won\u2019t pinch your bum.\u201d All their hands went up: most of them had had producers asking them out for drinks, or they\u2019d felt bad because they\u2019d turned someone down and thought if they hadn\u2019t they might have got the gig. I don\u2019t have an answer. Other than equality, true equality. We\u2019re sort of existing on hope that people are listening generally in society. JG: It\u2019s better than it was 10 years ago, but still \u2013 how many times have I played festivals and I\u2019m the only female on that stage? [Dance music] is a very male-heavy industry. I can count on my two hands how many times I\u2019ve done a gig with a girl promoting. How many times have I turned up and someone says something and you sigh and feel uncomfortable and awkward? At least half my gigs I\u2019m by myself. You have to be very aware of how you conduct yourself, how you look at someone, so they don\u2019t get the wrong idea. It\u2019s lame, you know? Like, how many times have promoters said wack things and I say: \u201cYou can\u2019t say that to me,\u201d and then they don\u2019t even know what to do? \u201cErm ... I didn\u2019t mean it!\u201d Well, you did, because you said it. NK: I think talking about it does help, because obviously there\u2019s the Weinsteins, the obvious predators, and then the relationship between men and women in the industry. If you have a conversation about that, I think there is genuinely a desire to get on and be respectful of each other. I think picking people up on things, saying: \u201cThis isn\u2019t how I want to be treated,\u201d having expectations of people to act in their highest self and not just think because we\u2019re doing music you can get away with treating people badly \u2026 JG: I was just going to say, it\u2019s in every industry. RT: But we\u2019ve got no HR department we can go to. Billie Eilish released her debut album in March, then become the youngest artist nominated in all four big Grammy categories. What makes her so compelling? NK: She seems to fit in with that idea of being real, not trying to make her success about her body. She doesn\u2019t suck up to anyone; she\u2019s doing it on her own terms and that\u2019s always been attractive, because kids like anarchy \u2013 they like a \u201cFuck you\u201d attitude. JT: There\u2019s a good narrative behind her, her making these records at home with her brother, which is cool. Also, pop music is respected now in the realms of pseudo-intellectual journalism. The Pitchforks, you know \u2013 pseudo-intellectual titles will champion pop music now. JG: It\u2019s just the cycle of the youthful person who has something to say and has style. At the other extreme, the biggest-selling album and single of the year were by Lewis Capaldi, who has no style, no image and looks like a completely ordinary person. JT: It\u2019s the same thing, though. It\u2019s a narrative. They\u2019ve both got narratives that sell records. WY: I hated Lewis Capaldi, because he held me off from getting to No 1, but I\u2019m over that now [laughs]. His being funny is a big thing. I saw that TV advert he did, where he was saying: \u201cI\u2019m just another singer-songwriter,\u201d and I thought it was really clever. NK: There\u2019s a romance now around really honest people who are telling it like it is, being upfront, letting it all hang out. Both Billie Eilish and Lewis Capaldi have hit on that in different ways, and they\u2019re refreshing, because we\u2019ve had so much false, processed shit. Lizzo released Cuz I Love You in April and became one of the year\u2019s biggest pop cultural phenomenons. She also became one of a number of artists to go to war with music critics, suggesting only people who made music themselves were capable of critiquing her work. Is that fair? Is music criticism a necessary evil, an important part of the process of making and releasing music, or a waste of time? RT: I think there\u2019s been a weird change where, about 10 years ago, you couldn\u2019t be negative about the NME or something because you wanted them onside. Now that\u2019s gone. Journalism is not as frightening a thing. It\u2019s streaming platforms you can\u2019t speak out against. JT: Don\u2019t underestimate journalists. No offence, but they\u2019re dangerous. I\u2019m not a violent man any more, but I wanted to be when our last album came out, because there were so many wild misquotes about my daughter dying and my wife would get very upset about it. It was like, that\u2019s me that\u2019s upsetting her, because it\u2019s me doing the interview, not some prick who doesn\u2019t care about this. NK: I remember reading one of Patti Smith\u2019s biographies and she said she used to write reviews because she loved stuff, she genuinely wanted to champion creativity. I think what has become so sad now is that all these bodies of people who are supposed to be authorities on things have now become \u2026 explicitly corrupt. It\u2019s obvious that lots of people are trying to get clicks. I\u2019m not talking about reviews, necessarily \u2013 my experience has been more with trying to discuss quite heated topics in a nuanced way, and I feel that I\u2019ve been misrepresented. Then it follows you and you have to deal with that for a long time. That\u2019s not fair. In June, Mick Jagger got back on stage three months after heart surgery. Is there too much pressure to tour \u2013 to generate revenue \u2013 at risk to your health? And, given the spate of high-profile suicides in K-pop, is the music industry doing enough to look after artists\u2019 physical and mental wellbeing? RT: I dream of being so successful that someone cares how I am! NK: I think the more successful you are, the less they care, because all the people around you are making money. You\u2019re in the machine \u2013 look at that Amy Winehouse documentary. But, at the beginning, I didn\u2019t know about taking care of my voice, or what was better to eat, how to handle running my own business. Why isn\u2019t there a manual for all managers that says: this is what you have to make sure your artist has, this is how to tour without getting exhausted, this is how not to lose your mind? Will, you had a very different, more extreme experience of fame to the others here: you were on Pop Idol and went from unknown to famous incredibly quickly. Was support given to you? WY: I was lucky; I had a lot of life experience. The management team I was with, they did things the way they\u2019d done with the Spice Girls and I said no. They tried to get me to move to some flat somewhere \u2013 no, I\u2019m quite happy where I am. They were sending Mercedes cars for me \u2013 well, who\u2019s paying for this? I\u2019ve got my own car, thanks. For me, the problems with wellbeing came when I had a breakdown, I had PTSD, and I tried to pull out of a tour. I\u2019d be on the dressing room floor, in a foetal position, couldn\u2019t look at my face in the mirror, didn\u2019t know who I was. JG: If you\u2019re a DJ, you\u2019re technically freelance, so there\u2019s always that fear: what if the gigs don\u2019t come? I\u2019ve had to make choices about how I want to shape my touring schedule so that I\u2019m mentally well: able to get up, get on the plane and go to the show and be kind to people. That\u2019s the biggest bit: when you\u2019re constantly travelling, it gets hard to be around people. The important thing to do is build your community, your team who are going to support you when the shit really hits the fan. JT: Our manager was one of my best friends. I think it\u2019s really important to have someone who can remind you of your self-worth, your cultural worth and your monetary worth. Stormzy\u2019s headline performance at Glastonbury in June was a landmark \u2013 he quoted David Lammy and spoke out against Boris Johnson. Is it tough for such a high-profile musician to take a political stand? JT: Of course. It was a beautiful thing he did, and a brave one. It\u2019s easier for me to be political when I\u2019m not selling all that many records, but the higher the platform you have, the more dangerous it becomes to fall off. Not in terms of record sales \u2013 he probably pissed off a lot of people that I wouldn\u2019t want to piss off if I was in his position. He\u2019s a young black man, and it\u2019s not easy for a young black man to be political without being dismissed as just being aggressive and all those other things. But he did it really well. WY: My dad is 69, a middle-class white guy, and he sent me a message about Stormzy saying: \u201cThat man is a statesman.\u201d He was just astonished by him. He\u2019s so authentic, so powerful. So what should a musician\u2019s role in politics be today? [Everyone, in unison]: Whatever they want it to be. JG: Exactly. That\u2019s what art is. It happens in a social context, it\u2019s commenting on what\u2019s happening around us. JT: It doesn\u2019t have to be overtly political. People assume I won\u2019t like anything that\u2019s not like the Clash, but my favourite album is Van Morrison\u2019s Astral Weeks. It\u2019s full of escapism, but it\u2019s also about Belfast. NK: I don\u2019t write political music, but I am involved in politics in my life. Art can be blatantly political or you can use narratives, archetypes, storytelling, mythology. Artists I admire take the pain, or the idea or the political viewpoint, and they distill it into characters, or colour, or landscape. It subconsciously touches you; it doesn\u2019t have to be blatant. I love Dave; I think what he talks about is really interesting. But that\u2019s not really where my strength is. It doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not commenting on what\u2019s going around me. JT: It\u2019s total dullardry to go: \u201cIt has to be in the lyrics.\u201d Look at jungle \u2013 that was a really empowering movement of communities that got together, built soundsystems, celebrated community through music. It spawned garage and grime. And there are no words in most jungle tracks. Lil Nas X\u2019s Old Town Road spent 19 weeks at No 1 in the US over the summer. Why was it so successful? JG: Because it\u2019s a freaking awesome record. RT: He\u2019s great, he\u2019s authentic, he\u2019s personable. And little kids loved it, didn\u2019t they? JT: It\u2019s like when we were talking about politics in music \u2013 you need a balance between realism and escapism. Lil Nas X is a very real person doing something celebratory. It\u2019s fun, but it\u2019s also important, it\u2019s also political. A country song by a gay black guy! That\u2019s sick. Can you imagine being in America and seeing that? It\u2019s brave. John Legend announced in October that he had rewritten the lyrics of Baby It\u2019s Cold Outside to make them more woke. Is there more pressure to be politically correct these days? NK: \u201cIt\u2019s your body and your choice\u201d [one of Legend\u2019s new lyrics]? It\u2019s a bit phoney. I don\u2019t mind the message, but I do think people are jumping on the bandwagon a bit and it doesn\u2019t feel genuine to me. RT: I agree 100%, but at least it\u2019s still positive. JT: There\u2019s a difference between political correctness that\u2019s valid, like: \u201cWhy are you calling it a chalkboard and not a blackboard\u201d? Well, it\u2019s not because people are offended by the word \u201cblackboard\u201d, you\u2019re just trying to change the cognition of using a word that defines something by its colour. I get that. But if someone\u2019s offended by something that\u2019s 50 or 60 years old [such as Baby It\u2019s Cold Outside] \u2026 it\u2019s a bit lame, it\u2019s a bit sheltered. You don\u2019t have to walk on eggshells; you\u2019re always going to offend someone somehow. Just be honest and true and don\u2019t be an arsehole. That\u2019s it. NK: If you really want to make a statement about something, write an original song. Changing the lyrics of something that\u2019s 50 years old just feels \u2026 RT: \u2026 contrived. In November, Coldplay announced they wouldn\u2019t be touring until they can make their concerts \u201cactively beneficial\u201d to the environment. What should artists be doing to combat the climate crisis? JG: People need to speak out about it, whether it\u2019s through your art, your actions, or just talking about it day to day with your friends and figuring out the things you can do to help out. I have my DJing and music, but I also have a talk series where I interview young scientists and talk about their work in layman\u2019s terms. The biggest thing is not just to talk about all the nerdy science stuff that I\u2019m really into [Jayda G has a master\u2019s degree in resource and environmental management], but to build empathy. That\u2019s why we\u2019re in this predicament in the first place. We forgot that we\u2019re animals, we\u2019re part of this Earth, and whatever we do has an impact on the greater system. I think once we figure out how to get closer to that source of understanding, people will inherently make the right decisions. As a DJ, when you get that one big gig that pays for you to fly all the way to Russia, do you really need to do that and put emissions into the world? NK: Do you think that if everybody made small adjustments like that it would make a difference? We\u2019re all trying desperately to do small things, but big corporations aren\u2019t taking us seriously. JG: I think the biggest decision you can make is to hold governments accountable, choosing to vote for what you believe in. In the end, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to make the big change."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
