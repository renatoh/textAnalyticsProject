The Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Omarosa Manigault Newman, alleging that she failed to file a required financial disclosure report after she was fired in December 2017. Senator Cory Booker weighs in on the image from the US-Mexico Border: Video of a Justice Department lawyer arguing in court that the federal government wasn\u2019t always legally required to provide soap and toothbrushes to detained migrant children went viral. Now, the lawyer, Sarah Fabian, is defending herself to her friends privately on Facebook, according to a post obtained by NBC News. \u201cI will say that I personally believe that we should do our very best to care for kids while they are in our custody, and I try to always represent that value in my work,\u201d Fabian wrote. \u201cA vast majority of the work that I do is not public, but I strive to help people by my participation in the process.\u201d Presidential candidate Julian Castro reacts to the image from the US-Mexico border: A heartbreaking photo of a drowned migrant and his toddler daughter is making the rounds at the moment. Read more below about the image and what it tells us about the reality at the US-Mexico border: The Justice Department filed a lawsuit against former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman for allegedly failing to file a required financial disclosure report after she was fired, the Hill is reporting. Manigault Newman faces fines of up to $50,000. The former Apprentice reality show villain was fired from the Trump White House, where she held the position of director of communications for the office of public liaison, in December 2017. She went on to write a searing tell-all memoir about her time in the White House. Hey all, Vivian Ho taking over for Oliver Laughland. Happy Tuesday. I\u2019m handing over our live coverage of a relatively quiet day in Washington to my colleague Vivian Ho in San Francisco now. Donald Trump has presented Staff Sgt. David Bellavia with the medal of honor, marking the first time a living veteran of the Iraq war has received the American military\u2019s highest award for valour. The award was given to Staff Sgt. Bellavia for actions taken during Operation Iraqi Freedom during combat in November 2004. \u201cDavid often tells young people, Americans don\u2019t want to fight. But if someone picks a fight for us, we\u2019ll win. We fight for love of our country,\u201d the Trump told an audience at the White House. Following the short ceremony the president did not take questions from reporters. Some more comments from Trump\u2019s appearance today have come through from the pool report. They relate in particular to Iran. Q: \u201cDo you have an exit strategy for Iran, if war does break out?\u201d Trump: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to need an exit strategy. I don\u2019t do exit strategies.\u201d And from earlier: Q: \u201cWhat message did you want to send to [Iran]?\u201d Trump: \u201cThere is no message. You know what, I\u2019ll tell you what the message is: When they\u2019re ready ... let isn\u2019t know. When they\u2019re ready, they\u2019ll let us know.\u201d Q: \u201cReady to negotiate?\u201d Trump: \u201cReady to do whatever. Doesn\u2019t make a difference. Whatever they want to do, I\u2019m ready.\u201d President Trump has made his first public appearance of the day at an executive order signing at the White House. Trump was enacting an order related to affordable housing. The pool report is not yielding a huge amount in the way of full quotes, but here\u2019s what we have: The president said he is \u201cvery concerned\u201d about conditions in detention centres near the border, but argued they were in better shape than under President Obama. He says that John Sanders, the CBP commissioner was not asked to resign. He again called on Democrats to back asylum law changes. \u201cWe need the votes of Democrats,\u201d he said. He falsely told reporters that a wall on the southern border is \u201cheavily under construction\u201d. Trump said the US is ready for \u201cwhatever\u201d Iran wants to do. The president commended Stephanie Grishman on her new job as press secretary. Here\u2019s some reaction to reports that acting CBP commissioner John Sanders is set to resign. Amnesty International USA advocacy director Charanya Krishnaswami says: Children should never be held in detention at all, let alone in the appalling conditions that were detailed in reports this weekend from a Texas border patrol station. Today\u2019s announcement that the chief of Customs and Border Protection is resigning is an opportunity for steps to be taken, including Congressional hearings and investigations, to provide accountability for these shocking abuses, and compassionate care to children seeking safety in the United States. Any effort to normalize the warehousing of children is unacceptable. Here\u2019s how things stand at lunch time today: Donald Trump has threatened Iran with \u201coverwhelming force\u201d and \u201cobliteration\u201d if the regime attacks \u201canything American\u201d in a series of Tweets. The comments followed Iran\u2019s admonishment of the president\u2019s latest round of sanctions. Stephanie Grisham, Melania Trump\u2019s communications lead, has been named the new White House press secretary. Her new role is a sweeping one, she will continue in the East Wing and also become White House communications chief. The acting head of Customs and Border Protection, John Sanders, is set to resign amid ongoing outcry against the administration\u2019s treatment of children in detention. Multiple outlets are reporting that acting Customs and Border Protection (CBP) commissioner John Sanders is set to resign amid ongoing outcry over the treatment in immigration detention. Sanders has only been at CBP since July 2018 after joining the department from the private sector. Outlets are reporting he will leave his job as the administration\u2019s top immigration official on 5 July. CNN is reporting that Grisham\u2019s new role will be a vastly expanded job. She will continue as Melania Trump\u2019s communication lead, take over Sanders\u2019 job as White House press secretary and will also be the White House communications director, filling the job vacated by Bill Shine earlier in the year. The news outlet reports that Grisham, who came through the Republican party communication ranks in Arizona, will accompany Donald Trump on his trip to the G20 summit in Japan this week. Stephanie Grisham, currently the communications director for First Lady Melania Trump has been named as the White House press secretary, following the departure of Sarah Huckabee Sanders. It appears she will also continue on as the First Lady\u2019s communications lead as well. Jared Kushner has been speaking in Manama, Bahrain, where his much-touted but much-doubted \u201cpeace to prosperity\u201d plan for Israel and the Palestinian territories, which contains a $50bn development blueprint, is making its first steps in the world. According to wire updates from Reuters transmitted in rather breathless capital letters, the president\u2019s son-in-law and chief adviser said political issues would not be discussed at the two-day \u201ceconomic workshop\u201d in Bahrain, because a political solution to the decades-old conflict is not possible without economic progress for the Palestinians. He also reportedly said the Trump administration \u201chas not given up\u201d on the Palestinians. This will be greeted with skepticism among Palestinians, given the relentlessly pro-Israel slant of US policy under Trump. Before the Manama conference began, prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said: \u201cWe have realised that this economic workshop in Bahrain is going to be really nonsense. It is just simply a theoretical piece of work calling for $50bn.\u201d For further reading, here\u2019s Julian Borger\u2019s preview of the event, published this morning: My colleague Emily Holden has been following a protest action at Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington ahead of the primary debates tomorrow. She sends this note: The Sunrise Movement is calling on the party to allow a climate-focused debate. DNC chair Tom Perez has warned that any candidate who participates in one will be banned from other party debates. Destiney Lee, a 22-year-old from Dallas, Texas, and a fellow with the Sunrise Movement, said she is protesting for the party to consider climate change as more than a single issue, as Perez has referred to the crisis caused by rising temperatures. \u201cWhich side are you on now, which side are you on?\u201d the protestors sang from the steps of the headquarters. They held signs with the words \u201cClimate Debate,\u201d \u201cGreen New Deal Now,\u201d and \u201c11 years.\u201d Scientists have said the world has just over a decade to begin to rapidly shift away from burning fossil fuels and other activities that heat the planet. A pair of congressmen have unveiled a bipartisan measure to block President Trump taking military action against Iran without congressional approval. An amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act being proposed by proposed by Democrat Rohit Khanna and Republican Matt Gaetz, a Trump loyalist, would block funding for military action in Iran without congressional approval. \u201cLast week, we watched President Trump come within minutes of striking Iran and involving the United States in yet another trillion-dollar war in the Middle East,\u201d said a statement from Khanna. \u201cPresident Trump campaigned on ending costly wars overseas, but given the advisors he chose and his recent risky actions, he is not living up to that promise.\u201d \u201cThis amendment affirms what President Trump knows and believes: unfocused, unconstitutional, unending wars in the Middle East make America weaker, not stronger,\u201d said Gaetz, as reported by The Hill. \u201cIran must be prevented from obtaining a nuclear weapon and threatening international peace, but Congress must resolve to ensure that any military action is carried out constitutionally.\u201d Trump has suggested earlier in the week he does not believe he needs congressional approval to launch military action. A bit more context on those incendiary tweets just sent by the president on Iran. Trump threatened \u201coverwhelming force\u201d and \u201cobliteration\u201d should Iran attack \u201canything American\u201d. The tweets are a response to Tehran\u2019s overnight response to the administration\u2019s new round of sanctions following the Iranian military downing an unmanned drone it claimed had entered Iranian airspace last week. The new sanctions directly target Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and were announced at public signing at the White House yesterday. Overnight Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called the new sanctions \u201coutrageous and idiotic\u201d and suggested the administration was \u201cafflicted by mental retardation\u201d for imposing them. \u201cYou sanction the foreign minister simultaneously with a request for talks?\u201d he said according to reports. With the first round of Democratic presidential primary debates set to take place tomorrow, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, currently polling at between 0-1% has tried sharing some of his debate preparation with the public. We\u2019ll leave you to judge: The president has sent another string of combative tweets aimed at the Iranian regime after signing another round of sanctions earlier in the week. It\u2019s more of the same when it comes to thinly veiled threats of military action and criticism of the previous administration\u2019s efforts to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear threat. Donald Trump\u2019s agriculture secretary has acknowledged that farmers are bearing the brunt of the president\u2019s ongoing trade war. Sonny Perdue acknowledged in an interview with CNN that US farmers are \u201cone of the casualties here with trade disruption\u201d. He added: \u201cWe knew going in that when you flew the penalty flag on China, the retaliation, if it came, would be against the farmer.\u201d Agricultural workers have been hurt by the administration\u2019s ongoing trade war with China after Beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs that have particularly effected soybean, corn and wheat growers in the US. The Trump administration has pledged $28 billion in aid to those affected by the tariffs. Here\u2019s a bit of reaction to last night\u2019s CNN interview and Trump\u2019s comments earlier on Monday. As is expected these days, they mostly split along partisan lines. From the president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr: From former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld who is attempting to wrest the Republican presidential nomination from Trump: And an observation from CNN\u2019s media editor that the allegations have attracted little coverage from the Trump favouring Fox News network. Here\u2019s some more of E Jean Carroll\u2019s comments on CNN last night. The advice columnist was appearing on Anderson Cooper\u2019s show after Trump doubled down on his denial of her allegations earlier in the day. In an interview with The Hill, Trump said: \u201cI\u2019ll say it with great respect: Number one, she\u2019s not my type. Number two, it never happened. It never happened, OK?\u201d 16 women have publicly accused the president of sexual misconduct and assault. On Monday evening Carroll told CNN that Trump\u2019s most recent denial followed a pattern. \u201cHe denies, he turns it around, he threatens and he attacks,\u201d she said. She went on to describe the attack in the mid 1990s at a Manhattan department store. She said there were no attendants in the changing room area at the time of the alleged incident and she did not file a report to the police. \u201cI wanted to forget it,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought A, my fault. B, I was stupid. C, I didn\u2019t think of it ... as rape. I thought of it as a violent incident. I thought of it as a fight,\u201d she said. The full interview is here. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of politics today in the US. Here\u2019s what\u2019s coming up. Last night the woman accusing Donald Trump of sexual assaulting her in the 1990s responded to Trump\u2019s denial and suggestion she was \u201cnot my type\u201d. Speaking on CNN the celebrated advice columnist E. Jean Carroll said: \u201cI love that, I am so glad I am not his type. I\u2019m so glad.\u201d Trump is scheduled to host a conference call with 10,000 US veterans to update them on progress since his the Mission Act, legislation that increases private healthcare protection for veterans. The roll out of the legislation had been criticized by a number of veterans\u2019 groups in recent weeks. A number of Democratic candidates for president are out on the road in Florida ahead of the first round of debates tomorrow. My colleague David Smith will be following Beto O\u2019Rourke and Elizabeth Warren in Miami. The president\u2019s son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner will lead the administration in a conference in Bahrian focused on peace in the Middle East. He will discuss the economic chapter of his controversial peace plan. We\u2019ll bring you live updates as they happen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
