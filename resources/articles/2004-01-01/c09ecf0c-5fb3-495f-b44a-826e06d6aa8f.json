Middlesbrough made an inquiry about the possibility of buying Butt but, although Manchester United were apparently happy to do business, the player has decided he wants to remain at the club and fight for a first-team place. \"Nicky Butt is a player I've always admired, no two ways about it,\" McClaren said yesterday. \"But my understanding of the lastest position with Nicky is that he is staying at Old Trafford and that's the end of it.\" One player likely to be signing for Middlesbrough is Danny Mills. The sometime England right-back is on a season-long loan from Leeds and, although McClaren fears his endeavours to obtain the player's registration this month may be doomed, he is confident of securing the transfer in the summer. \"We're trying to have daily dialogue with Leeds about Danny but with their current predicament it is very difficult. We've made it clear we want a permanent deal, though, and while I'm never usually confident about any transfer I am very confident that Danny will become a Boro player.\" McClaren, recently rebuffed by Liverpool's Emile Heskey, also hopes to have a new striker by the close of the transfer window. \"I'd like to strengthen, I need to strengthen and I'm still trying for a striker,\" he said. \"We've made a few inquiries.\" Even so, defence is very much on the manager's mind as he prepares for the visit of an Arsenal side against whom his players have already conceded 12 goals in three of their four previous meetings this season. The most recent encounter was last Saturday's 4-1 FA Cup reverse in north London but the Carling Cup semi-final first leg at Highbury proved the exception, with Boro prevailing 1-0. In order to protect that lead McClaren needs Gareth Southgate and Ugo Ehiogu, his first-choice central defensive pairing, to pass late fitness tests. \"We're sweating on those two,\" he said. \"This is the most important game of our season and one of the biggest games at this club for many years so 1-0 is a slender lead.\" Ars\u00e8ne Wenger effectively fielded a reserve side for the first leg but the impression that Arsenal are not overly bothered about the Carling Cup has been countered by suggestions that their manager will play Patrick Vieira from the start tonight as he warms to the idea of attempting to win a treble. \"I'm under pressure from myself to win trophies because that's what I came here to do but I don't think we want the win more than them,\" said McClaren. \"It's going to be difficult because any Arsenal side always plays with pride. Anyway, look at the team they had on on view last week; Tour\u00e9, Keown, Cygan, Parlour, Silva and Kanu are no mugs and would all grace any Premiership club. Put Vieira in among them and it wouldn't be a bad line-up for any side.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
