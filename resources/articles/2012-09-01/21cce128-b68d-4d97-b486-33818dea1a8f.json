In a possible sign of unease over the recent spending cuts, the number calling for an increase in spending and taxation to strengthen public services rose for the first time in nine years last year. The survey, prepared by the National Centre for Social Research, comes amid a growing feeling in Downing Street that Britain may be embarking on a slow economic recovery. Sir John Major gave voice to this view, only expressed in private by ministers, when he told the BBC on Sunday he hoped Britain had \"passed the darkest moment\". The former prime minister echoed the views of ministers that the recent negative GDP figures may be inaccurate because employment is growing and industrial production is increasing. But George Osborne may have to embark on a harsher than expected strategy in his autumn statement, by accelerating spending cuts or abandoning his debt target, if the Office for Budget Responsibility confirms that a greater proportion of the lost GDP is permanent, or structural. The chancellor is warned in Monday's British Social Attitudes survey that he will have to tread carefully. The survey found that support for higher spending and higher taxes increased from 31% to 36% between 2010 and 2011. Of those questioned, 55% would like spending to remain at the same level. The survey says: \"This is a modest increase, but it could well be the first sign of a reaction against the public spending reductions that the government has begun to implement, and which are set to accumulate between now and 2017.\" The findings show little support for further cuts. But they also show Osborne may have judged the national mood when he warned in the budget that the slower economic growth means an extra \u00a310bn in welfare cuts to avoid much deeper cuts to health and education. The survey found that 59% believe the government should be mainly responsible for ensuring unemployed people have enough to live on against 88% in 2001. The survey found little support (28%) for the view that the \"government should spend more on welfare benefits even if it leads to higher taxes\". This compares with 58% in 1991. There is little support (15%) for an increase in benefits for unemployed people. But there is strong support an increase in benefits for disabled people who cannot work (53%) and overwhelming support (75%) for an increase in benefits for those who care for sick and disabled people. In a chapter on welfare, the survey's co-director Elizabeth Clery writes: \"While attitudes to different aspects of welfare are behaving in a far from uniform way, they are generally moving in line with the current direction of government policy, rather than responding as they have previously to the onset of recession. We see that the public is becoming less supportive of the government taking a leading role in providing welfare to the unemployed, and even to the elderly in retirement. There is less enthusiasm about public spending on all types of benefits and an increasing belief that the welfare system encourages dependence.\" The survey also found a fall in satisfaction with the NHS from an all-time high of 70% in 2010 to 58% in 2011, the first drop in a decade. The NHS budget has been spared most of the cuts because David Cameron has pledged to ensure that it rises at least in line with inflation. But this is tight compared with the last decade when the NHS budget has risen by between 4% to 5% a year in real terms. Of those questioned, 51% would like a large reduction in immigration levels. A further 24% would like to see immigration reduced modestly. The government responded to the findings by insisting that ministers would continue to stabilise the public finances. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: \"There is nothing fair about running huge budget deficits and burdening future generations with our debts. If we don't restore sense to the public finances now, the impact on families and businesses will be worse in the long term, with less money to deliver public services in the future. That has meant tough decisions on spending, but the government has taken action to cut out waste and bring the welfare bill under control so that we can prioritise frontline services, such as the NHS, that people rely on.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
