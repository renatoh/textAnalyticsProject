But not all. One exception may be Playgirl, a title that relaunches this week, featuring a cast of diverse and diversely focused writers and photographers orientated on the lives of women. It\u2019s an unusual moment to launch a magazine, especially a print-only title. Unusual, too, to relaunch a magazine that briefly \u2013 around 1973 \u2013 mirrored its recherch\u00e9 moment under the subheading \u201cEntertainment for women\u201d. The new incarnation comes with the declaration: \u201cWe\u2019ll take it from here\u201d. Playgirl, a notionally feminist title, simply countered Playboy\u2019s Norman Mailer with Maya Angelou, Hunter S Thompson with Margaret Atwood, and matched its male centrefolds \u2013 pose for pose, Speedos (or less) for lingerie (or less) \u2013 with those of Playboy\u2019s women. \u201cThey\u2019re really fabulous in so many ways, but they do look like a man\u2019s idea of what a feminist publication would be,\u201d Playgirl\u2019s editor-in-chief, Skye Parrott, told the Observer. \u201cEverything they did in Playboy, they did in Playgirl. It was interesting for a couple of years, then it was sold and resold, and it became what I thought of as a gay porn magazine.\u201d Indeed, the magazine\u2019s opening essay, by writer T Cole Rachel, talks about the irony of a magazine that was intended for women being co-opted by men \u2013 even if those men were gay. Parrott, a photographer and mother of three, is the former editor of Dossier, a New York-based magazine that in a co-operative and hip fashion championed social and racial diversity, the female gaze, and other aspects of progressive 2020 enlightenment, well ahead of the media industry, and perhaps society at large. Dossier played a part in launching the careers of Cass Bird, Harley Weir, Zo\u00eb Ghertner and Bibi Borthwick, who have come to define the post-male-gaze aesthetic in fashion photography. Women wrote about losing their virginity; Dossier talked to the Iranian artist Shirin Neshat; Parrott, who once ran art photographer Nan Goldin\u2019s studio, went to photograph fashion in Jacmel, on Haiti\u2019s southern coast. Playgirl, almost by definition, is an oddity at this juncture when the publishing business is in a precarious state. It\u2019s best seen as a creative enterprise, hopefully to be repeated, headed by Parrott and executed over two years with the backing of neophyte publisher Jack Lindley Kuhns. It carries a lightness of touch, refreshing without being oblivious, and redolent of a surrendered but not abandoned life as much else teeters. \u201cThe world we all live in was created by men, and so it is centred around male values. I wanted to create a magazine that could offer an alternate point of view \u2013 the feminine,\u201d Parrott says. \u201cWho creates images is important, and the politics of gender has been woven through my work. I thought deeply about what a feminist publication could be, what it could achieve, what stories it should tell and how they\u2019re told. I hope it\u2019s now a woman\u2019s idea of what a feminist publication can be, what feminist values are, and how a magazine can elevate them.\u201d For the relaunch cover, the actress Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, 45 and nine months pregnant, posed naked for her friend Mario Sorrenti, a visitor from the male spectrum. \u201cThe picture is antithetical to the male gaze. Her expression is tentative, the picture\u2019s power comes from her pregnant body. It\u2019s a hyper-feminine thing: not a sexualised body, but a human body,\u201d says Parrott. Elsewhere, the magazine includes the in-demand black writer Carvell Wallace, who writes on the slow fall of the patriarchy and how women and men will be well shot of it; an essay on the relief of surrender (in the spiritual sense); models that are challenging outdated ideals of beauty; and the jewellery designer Pamela Love on the exhaustion and mental health challenges of making the exterior match the interior \u2013 \u201ca darkness brought me to my knees, but it also brought me to a place where I was able to make choices\u201d. And it talks to indigenous female artisans of the organisation Kiptik in Chiapas, Mexico, connecting them to fashion retailers looking to weave sustainability into design and manufacturing. \u201cRather than suggesting that the path for successful women is in the male world, we wanted to show that traditional female crafts can be turned into a viable path for women to sustain themselves,\u201d Parrott says. There are personal essays on the power of desire, the fashion for radical modesty, and a focus on community building, with entries by the teenage climate justice activist Elsa Mengistu and Chanel Miller, the author of Know My Name, a memoir that changed the cultural conversation around consent, assault and rape on college campus, plus the work of music executive turned refugee campaigner Josie Naughton. The writer Alicia Garza, co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2013, writes on her life as a racial justice activist: \u201cI hate the word \u2018woke\u2019. It\u2019s as if there\u2019s some level of enlightenment that you get to, and then your work is over. It becomes a weird clique, like \u2018I know everything\u2019, and then other people are outcasts and pariahs if they don\u2019t use the right lingo.\u201d But Playgirl couldn\u2019t function as Playgirl without addressing nudity. The notion, Parrott says, was to approach it from the perspective of vulnerability. Harley Weir\u2019s centrefold of a sitting black figure without overt muscularity was selected to get that point across. \u201cFor a man, nudity means sex; for a woman, it means you\u2019re exposed,\u201d says Parrott. \u201cIt\u2019s a different lens and, hopefully, a different perspective.\u201d The portrait is adjacent to a double-page spread of two erect penises pointing at each other. \u201cIt\u2019s really funny, but it\u2019s got some subversion to it,\u201d Parrott says. \u201cPictures of naked men are inherently subversive in and of themselves.\u201d Playgirl\u2019s subtle overlap of the personal and the political points a way beyond the present architecture. It owes much to Parrott\u2019s previous work at Dossier and her experience as a photographer and managing editor at Self Service magazine in Paris. Parrott noticed that as she moved along, many women in her field fell away, or gave up something \u2013 a family, for instance \u2013 in order to progress. \u201cIt worried me and it didn\u2019t sit right. Once I had created a space \u2013 a magazine \u2013 for people whose work I believed in, a lot of them turned out to be women.\u201d Dossier, she recalls, was designed as \u201can inclusive space with lots of different points of view and different people, like New York itself. Body-inclusivity and diversity were a given. At the time, the conversation about how women and diverse voices weren\u2019t being afforded the same opportunities wasn\u2019t as loud as it is today.\u201d For Playgirl, there were companion thoughts, one of which was voiced by the writer Ruth Whippman in the New York Times last year under the headline: \u201cEnough leaning in. Let\u2019s tell men to lean out.\u201d The magazine, which hits US newstands this week, arrives as the pandemic has exposed and amplified a range of social fractures and injustices. While women have been disproportionately affected, it\u2019s been a leveller, in certain respects, with men now also stuck at home, on Zoom calls, with children running under their feet. In some ways, Parrott says, the chance for a reset has been a gift. \u201cThe world right now requires a certain vulnerability and flexibility, and I wonder if women have had more practice living in that space because we\u2019ve been required and allowed to. The question is, rather than demanding women lean in and act more like men, is there an opportunity to take more feminine concepts and offer them to the world?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
