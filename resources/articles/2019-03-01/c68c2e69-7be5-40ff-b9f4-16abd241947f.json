The 46-year-old is in interim charge until the summer and is keen to continue beyond that. He is unbeaten in the Premier League going into Saturday\u2019s match at home to Southampton. Asked whether it was strange to do promotional work, Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cIt\u2019ll be stranger to see yourself in the video if you\u2019re not here but no it\u2019s not strange doing it. If my kids see a commercial with me in it and I\u2019m back home in Norway that\u2019ll be strange probably.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r brushed off whether supporters who may be thinking of buying a season ticket deserve clarity regarding who will be the manager next season. \u201cI\u2019ve done a video shoot on season tickets so I\u2019m pleading for them to get their season tickets,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s me as a supporter or manager I don\u2019t know but they should still buy their season tickets because the club is going somewhere.\u201d That journey looks set to be without Antonio Valencia after Solskj\u00e6r hinted that the right-back\u2019s United career would end in the summer after 10 years. The club did not trigger a one-year extension on his contract before Friday\u2019s 5pm deadline. Valencia became club captain last summer but has suffered an injury-blighted campaign, managing only one league start in the past five months. The 33-year-old has made 338 appearances for United since Sir Alex Ferguson signed him from Wigan Athletic in June 2009. If United do not trigger the clause they could still offer a fresh deal to Valencia, whose contract expires this summer, but Solskj\u00e6r suggested it was unlikely. \u201cHe\u2019s still not 100% fit, he is still working to get back fit and he\u2019s had a fantastic career here at Man United and in England,\u201d the interim manager said. \u201cHe is one of the Premier League winners left in the dressing room but at the moment I\u2019m not sure if Man United and Antonio will agree on the next year. \u201cSo it depends if he gets back on the pitch as well in the next few months but he\u2019s the captain, a great servant to the club.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r is intent that he and his players should embrace \u201csqueaky bum time\u201d, as his former manager Sir Alex Ferguson called the closing part of the season, as United enter the final phase in contention for a top-four finish, the Champions League and the FA Cup. \u201cI\u2019m not a nervous guy,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cI need to relax, I need to enjoy it. I think my players see as well that I do enjoy this. This is the best time of their lives playing here. These are the times Man United players step up, when the going gets tough. You sign up for challenges, you sign up to rise to those challenges when you\u2019re at Man United. We\u2019ve got Arsenal [on Sunday week] coming up, PSG away coming up, big games. These are the periods and times that make them stay in the history of the club.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
