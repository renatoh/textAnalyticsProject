On the face of it the increase appears to be a miniscule budget boost of \u00a313m, but ITV say it is a 7% increase because it uses Carlton and Granada's financial year as opposed to the traditional calendar year to tot up budgets. This year the network is spending \u00a3836m over the calendar year, and ITV's director of programmes, Nigel Pickard, had already admitted a huge increase was not on the cards. But in an announcement designed to address questions in the City, ITV announced a new budget of \u00a3849m as \"a 7% increase\". This describes the budget from the 12 months to the end of September 2004 - which coincides with Carlton and Granada's financial years. The broadcaster's annual programming budget for the same period in 2002-2003 was \u00a3792m. Some of the money from the extra \u00a357m made available by Carlton and Granada to Mr Pickard will be channelled into entertainment, comedy and factual shows for the 10pm-10.30pm slot that will be vacated by News at Ten. More money will also being going into sport over a 12 month period, with ITV providing exclusive live coverage of the current rugby union World Cup and sharing coverage of next summer's football European Championships with the BBC. However, the ITV network budget still lags behind the money BBC1 invests in programming, which stood at \u00a3858m for the year to 31 March 2003. ITV's programming budget for the calendar year of 2003 is \u00a3836m, compared to \u00a3775m for 2002. The network could not say what the equivalent budget was for the next year but said Granada and Carlton would probably revert to calendar year for budgets once they merged. Last year ITV's network budget was boosted midway through last year by a \u00a325m injection from the two ITV companies. ITV Network Centre commissioning editors, and in particular drama controller Nick Elliott, have also had extra money this year because \u00a360m from the sport budget that last year went on football World Cup coverage has been redistributed to other programming genres. Carlton and Granada have pledged to plough a significant proportion of the \u00a355m a year savings they are planning through their merger to create ITV plc back into the network programming budget. But with the merger likely to take up to a year to complete, these savings will not filter through to the ITV programming budget until late 2004 at least. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
