Like Mackie's Fresh Winter, who hacked up in his first handicap, Mabel has run promisingly at Doncaster this season, finishing fourth to highly-rated Sentry Duty on her second run over hurdles in February. Even on the form of her latest effort at Huntingdon when around 13 lengths behind subsequent handicap winner Kerriemuir Lass, she has a good chance of winning the 4.10 at Stratford. LORD RYEFORD ran well in the Jewson Novices' Handicap Chase at Cheltenham and should enjoy the drop in class in the 3.40 where recent Newton Abbot winner Down The Stretch looks the biggest threat. At Great Leighs' first meeting, CROSS THE LINE (3.50) tries 10 furlongs for the first time. He has a good turn of foot over a mile and if that can be harnessed over the longer trip he will go well after a warm-up at Kempton that caught the eye. Most of Mick Channon's horses have needed their first runs, so GREEN WADI (4.50) should be fitter for his fourth at Lingfield. The second, third and seventh (twice) have won since to frank the form.
