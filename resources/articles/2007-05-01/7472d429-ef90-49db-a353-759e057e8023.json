There can be no ulterior motives for cameo appearances from Willy Mason or Fat Lip from the Pharcyde at this stage in the game, and even the slightly more modish Midlake and Klaxons are gleefully subordinated to the flow of a record which is probably the most exquisitely integrated single listening experience the Chemical Brothers have yet come up with."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
