And I now realise, partly because I\u2019m not entirely immune to information, that this was wrong.\u201d The pioneering feminist and public intellectual was responding to a question on the ABC panel show Q&amp;A on Monday night from journalist Steph D\u2019Souza, who introduced herself as a former fan. \u201cWhen I was younger I found your work a great source of strength and inspiration,\u201d D\u2019Souza said. \u201cIt helped me resist the limitations that society or even misogynists could place on me but I find really confusing views you\u2019ve expressed that transgender women are not real women. Why do you believe there is such a thing as a real woman? Isn\u2019t that the kind of essentialism that you and I are trying to resist and escape?\u201d But it wasn\u2019t to be. After conceding she had been wrong in the past, Greer offered an observation about the intersex spectrum and declared that a transgender person could not know their real gender identity, because \u201cyou don\u2019t know what the other sex is\u201d. The Female Eunuch author then said it \u201cwasn\u2019t fair\u201d that \u201ca man who has lived for 40 years as a man and had children with a woman and enjoyed the services \u2013 the unpaid services of a wife, which most women will never know ... then decides that the whole time he\u2019s been a woman.\u201d The internet responded by again accusing Greer of transphobia, a word which, last year, she joked did not exist. \u201cAt the beginning of your answer I thought you were digging yourself out of the hole and now I wonder if you\u2019ve just shovelled it back in,\u201d host Tony Jones observed. \u201cI belong in this hole,\u201d Greer replied, shortly before launching into a discussion of intersex gender reassignment surgery and saying people should be allowed to live outside the gender binary \u2013 so long as they did not attempt to become the other gender. \u201cIf you\u2019re a 50-year-old truck driver who\u2019s had four children with a wife and you\u2019ve decided the whole time you\u2019ve been a woman, I think you\u2019re probably wrong,\u201d she said. She has previously rejected claims that her brand of feminism was trans-exclusionary, telling BBC Newsnight last year: \u201cApparently people have decided that because I don\u2019t think that post-operative transgender men are women, I\u2019m not to be allowed to talk. I\u2019m not saying that people should not be allowed to go through that procedure, what I\u2019m saying is it doesn\u2019t make them a woman.\u201d Greer was on the panel with Liberal MP Sharman Stone, Tasmanian Labor senator Lisa Singh, columnist Theodore Dalrymple, and Aria-award winning oud player Joseph Tawadros. Dalrymple sided with Greer on matters of gender identity, but had earlier earned her scorn for offering that, in his extensive clinical experience, domestic violence was rooted in sexual jealousy. \u201cI probably would have thought that actually what drives it is misogyny, is actual dislike of women and not understanding them,\u201d Greer said. The comment was made in response to a question from a woman named Mary McArthur, who suggested efforts to curb domestic violence ought to focus on why women ended up in relationships with abusive men and target the women who had made \u201cpoor relationship choices\u201d. Stone and Singh said victims of domestic violence could not safely walk away from their abusers and should be supported, not blamed for what had happened to them. \u201cIt\u2019s the most dangerous time for the woman and her children when she does choose to leave,\u201d Stone said. \u201cShe is more likely to be killed when she does choose to say, \u2018It\u2019s over. I\u2019m going,\u2019 and on average a woman tries seven times in Australia to pack up and leave.\u201d However she said teaching girls from a young age that abuse was not acceptable and encouraging financial independence could help. \u201cIt\u2019s a range of things we\u2019ve got to do but never blame the victim, the woman, because she hasn\u2019t walked away or she\u2019s chosen a rotten man to be the father of her children and she can\u2019t escape without endangering their lives,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
