As leaders and senior figures of faith communities, we urge our co-religionists and others to think about the implications of a Leave vote for the things about which we are most passionate. The past 70 years have been the longest period of peace in Europe\u2019s history. Institutions that enable us to work together and understand both our differences and what we share in common contribute to our increased security and sense of collective endeavour. What\u2019s more, so many of the challenges we face today can only be addressed in a European, and indeed a global, context: combating poverty in the developing world, confronting climate change and providing the stability that is essential to tackling the migration crisis. We hope that when voting on 23 June, people will reflect on whether undermining the international institutions charged with delivering these goals could conceivably contribute to a fairer, cleaner and safer world.

Despite the fall in the price of oil, 2015 saw a new record for global investment in renewables \u2013 more than double the amount invested in new coal and gas power plants. In Italy, for instance, more than 39% of gross electricity generation came from renewable sources in 2015. In Germany, the figure was 32.5% and the department of energy and climate change recently announced that the UK\u2019s renewables sector won 24.7% of the country\u2019s total generation last year. This month alone, Portugal has managed to run entirely on renewables for more than 100 consecutive hours. Quite suddenly, Europe\u2019s future looks both cleaner and safer. This investment not only ensures lower carbon emissions, but it also has implications for the EU\u2019s energy independence and the knock-on effects of that independence on security. A burgeoning renewables sector is cutting our import bills for energy and helping to keep the price of oil low. Consequently, Russia will be less likely to threaten to stop the flow of its gas to Europe and less able to indulge in military adventures on the EU\u2019s eastern borders. Equally, certain Gulf operators will be less able to afford peddling pernicious versions of Islam around the world. The growth in clean energy promises improved security and a more robust diplomacy. Eurof Thomas Cardiff Gentrification of the Co-op I was pleased to read that the Co-op is to relaunch its food business with not only a revived logo but also, in an attempt to attract a million more members, a reintroduction of the \u201cdivi\u201d and other rewards schemes (\u201cCo-op hopes to leave the past behind with revival of its classic 60s look\u201d, Business, last week). In recent years, the latter have been sadly lacking. However, I am not convinced that these measures will be enough to revive the Co-op\u2019s fortunes. The movement has abandoned its former customers (working people) for the more expensive convenience market that they, for their main shop, cannot afford. It is my view that the Co-op, like the Labour party, no longer serves its historic constituency. The Rochdale Pioneers of 1844 would not have approved of what can only be described as the gentrification of the Co-op, something that also appears to have happened to Labour. The Co-op needs to get back to its core values. I do support its mutuality, its community ambitions and the changes outlined in Angela Monaghan\u2019s excellent article, but these will not be enough to restore the Co-op to its rightful position. Roger Frost Burnley, Lancs For crying out loud Shame on you for omitting Truly, Madly, Deeply, the best British weepie in living memory, from your list of \u201cfilms that made us cry\u201d. Viewing it for the first time, it grabbed me by the throat so viscerally that it took all my might to hold back what threatened to be a wave of uncontrollable sobs, leaving me awash in sweet sadness \u2013 and, like all those around me, silently mopping copious tears from the corners of my eyes. Ms Lee Robinson London N19 Jennifer Lawrence is no starlet Misogyny alert! To quote: \u201cJennifer Lawrence \u2018the Oscar-winning starlet\u2019, who \u2018seems to delight in mocking herself during interviews\u2019\u201d (Palais gossip, New Review, last week). Does Nigel Smith hanker for the 1950s, when \u201cstarlet\u201d was an acceptable term for women actors, featured more for their skimpy clothing than their acting? Jennifer Lawrence has rightly stood up for equal pay for men and women actors. She\u2019s won an Oscar, for heaven\u2019s sake. But Mr Smith seems not to rate her intelligence.
