We weren't given wi-fi access inside the main conference room itself, which prevented me from blogging the announcements in real time, but if you want to see exactly what was put out on stage, take a look at the Apple website The big products, hardware-wise were the MacMini - the monitorless unit that had been codenamed Q88 in pre-show speculation - and the flash-based iPod Shuffle, a dinky little unit that is intended to break the lower end of the market. MacMini: Jobs: \"This is the most affordable Mac ever. In fact it's the cheapest computer Apple has ever offered.\" It's tiny (around 6\"x2\") but comes without any peripherals at all, in a move which Jobs termed \"BYODKM\" (Bring Your Own Desktop Mouse and Keyboard). It was eerily reminiscent of the ill-fated Cube, but perhaps Apple feel that the price point ($499 for the cheapest, 40GB model) was the most important thing. Personally, I'm disappointed that they didn't use this opportunity to move into Media Center territory and are instead focusing on converting existing PC users and getting them into the Mac fold. iPod Shuffle: Steve gave a warning to the rest of the digital music player market when he pointed out iPod's figures. \"A year ago iPod's market share was about 31% and flash players had 62%. We introduced the iPod Mini to go after the high end of the flash market. By January 2005, the iPod's market share has doubled to 65% and flash has halved. But we'd like to go after the remaining mainstream flash market.\" And this little model is what they want to do that. No screen, and wearable (either pendant-style, sport armband etc), it's probably going to be a much more important product to Apple in terms of volume than the MacMini. It comes in sizes of 512MB and 1GB - not 2GB, which disappointed those of us who had thought it might be on the cards, and costs either $99 or $149. Contrary to rumours before the show, it *can* play designated playlists as well as on random, so it's not going to annoy music fanatics too much. Steve also demonstrated the new iLife, iWork and OSX Tiger - all building on existing products really. One big surprise was when he wheeled out the president of Sony, Kunitake Ando, to talk about the dual push from the firms to promote HDTV over the next year. Two rivals getting together to promote a standard was an interesting twist that I hadn't anticipated. But then apparently neither had Jobs - Ando said he'd only got the invite to turn up and speak at the weekend. The crowd were behaving in their usual over-excited manner (people running to get seats, whooping with delight all the way through, laughing at jokes that weren't even funny) but that's the way Apple does things, I suppose. Strange, when you consider they're just a technology firm, but there's a kind of giddy excitement that passes around most of the arena in waves. Anyway, those are the big announcements. I'll write more later - time to go and look around the stands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
