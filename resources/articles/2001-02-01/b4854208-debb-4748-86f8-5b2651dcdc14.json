Just two weeks after police in the Catalan capital arrested a man for planning to kidnap a Bar\u00e7a player, the abductors are at it again. To be fair to Santiago Cant\u00f3n, an escapee from Barcelona\u00b4s Modelo Prison and the man up to no good this time round, at least he knew who he was after: midfield baldy and \"little Buddha\", Iv\u00e1n de la Pe\u00f1a. Cant\u00f3n - and a woman whose name hasn't yet been released but whose initials are AMA - followed de la Pe\u00f1a home from the Camp Nou on Monday. Fortunately, de la Pe\u00f1a was on the ball enough (groan) to take down the registration number of the car that pursued him, and managed to escape when he was approached in the underground car park at his home. The attempted kidnappings have come as a huge psychological blow to one Bar\u00e7a player in particular. Michael Reitzeger was \"horrified\" by recent events and admitted on his website that he is \"very worried, especially as this kind of thing gives people all sorts of crazy ideas. I'm constantly looking in my mirrors to see if I'm being followed these days and I keep double-checking the locks and alarms at my house.\" \"I'm terrified,\" declared the Dutchman. \"It's like something out of the Wild West.\" While Reitzeger was busy hiding out in the Sheriff\u00b4s Office on Saturday night, the rest of the Bar\u00e7a side seemed totally unconcerned, destroying Athletic Bilbao in the Nou Camp. Barcelona boss Lorenzo Serra Ferrer had the cheek to enjoy things a bit too much and, worse still, to demand even more. With Serra Ferrer still cajoling his side at 5-0 up with goals from Abelardo, Cocu and Luis Enrique (3), Athletic manager Txetxu Rojo decided he'd had enough and turned to the Bar\u00e7a dug-out to remonstrate with his bemused opposite number. \"What\u00b4s the matter with you?\" he ever-so politely enquired. \"Do you want some more? Isn't this score enough for you?\" Obviously not - Cocu and Overmars added two more to complete the scoring at 7-0. Bar\u00e7a's win has had the Catalan press purring. Sport declared Serra Ferrer\u00b4s side \"the true dream team\". It also re-establishes the blaugranas's championship credentials. But despite 17 games unbeaten, Bar\u00e7a just can't close the gap on Real Madrid, who survived a tough test from M\u00e1laga on Sunday. Dario Silva and Dely Vald\u00e9s yet again proved their class for M\u00e1laga. It was Ra\u00fal, though, who was the real star, despite recent criticism. His two headed goals helped Real Madrid to a 4-3 victory and took him to the top of the league's goalscoring charts, and at 23 he's already scored more in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n than anyone else currently playing. It's not just Bar\u00e7a chasing Madrid, though. Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a remain a point ahead of the Catalans in second place after beating relegation-bound Racing Santander 2-1, with Roy Makaay grabbing two more goals. Makaay's first caused a bit of a stir - he was miles offside, the linesman's flag went up, Racing's defenders stopped, their keeper Jos\u00e9 Ceballos stopped, even Depor\u00b4s players stopped. But eagle-eyed referee Meg\u00eda D\u00e1vila, aware that the \"pass\" to Makaay was a deflection off Racing striker Mazzoni, didn't, and waved the Dutchman on to score easily. A giggling Makaay waxed lyrical over the assist: \"It was a phenonmenal pass from Racing's striker.\" While Bar\u00e7a, Madrid and Depor kept up their end, Valencia stumbled again, this time in Mallorca, where Alberto Luque scored a late equaliser to secure a 2-2 draw for Luis Aragon\u00e9s's side. Things have gone from bad to worse for H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper's super troops, but with the league's four strongest sides now out of the way and new signing Pablo Aimar set to join the team next week (he was in the stand on Sunday), Valencia fans can perhaps look forward to better times. One slight problem, though - the Italian passport fiasco is about to touch down in Spain, with judge Guariniello set to look into 27 La Liga players of \"italoamerican\" origin. And if reports in today's press are anything to go by, Valencia's Fabian Ayala is first in line - with a possible six-month jail sentence if found guilty. Meanwhile, Mallorca fans seemed less interested Valencia's visit than the arrival of Celta de Vigo for the Cup quarter-final second-leg in midweek. Mallorquinos carried banners on Sunday warning Celta players, and Valeri Karpin in particular, not to come to the Balearics and accusing the Galician club of \"buying referees with drugs\". Why? Well, all the fun centres on a bruising and extremely bad-tempered first-leg, and on two incidents in particular. First, a penalty given to Celta by referee Antonio L\u00f3pez Nieto despite the fact that he couldn't possibly have seen the \"challenge\" in question - he had his back to the incident and only turned round in time to see the final, and less blatant, stages of a shocking dive from Vagner. The second thing that wound up Mallorca fans was the running battle involving Karpin, Finidi George, Samuel Eto\u00f3 and the Bala\u00eddos crowd which boiled over at the final whistle and again at the airport later that night. Eto\u00f3 had fired a parting \"gesture\" at the Celta fans at the end of the game and one of them decided to go to the airport to have it out with the Cameroon striker in person. Luis Aragon\u00e9s tried to calm the fan down, but soon lost his conciliatory mood when he called Eto\u00f3 a \"black shit\". Aragon\u00e9s took off his glasses (a la Clark Kent) and proceeded to grab the man by the throat. Only the intervention of players and club officials kept a seething Aragon\u00e9s at bay. Meanwhile, L\u00f3pez Nieto\u00b4s inept display has opened up the refereeing debate - yet again. This time, one of the solutions being banded about by players is the introduction of foreign refs. Obviously, Mauro Silva, Miguel Soler and the rest have never seen Graham Poll in action. Even though Pablo Aimar stayed in the stand, there were some big name debuts this weekend. Stan Collymore, on as a second-half sub, couldn't stop Oviedo securing a new league record - they've now gone ten away games without a goal following a 1-0 defeat at Las Palmas. Collymore barely saw the ball. What he did see, though, was the weekend's scariest moment - a clash between Oviedo\u00b4s Pablo Su\u00e1rez and Las Palma\u00b4s Josico, resulting in a bizarre fit for the Oviedo man that left him looking terrified and uncontrollably waving his arms and legs about like an upside-down woodlouse. He was rushed to hospital where, fortunately, he's been given the all-clear. The most eagerly awaited debutant was, of course, Mart\u00edn Palermo. The Argentinian may partake of feather boas and evening dresses but he doesn't wear women's knickers - not during games anyway. Palermo was pulled down by the shorts for what should have been a penalty during Villarreal's 2-0 win over Alav\u00e9s on Sunday. Eager to prove that he'd been fouled, \"El Loco\" left his shorts down and brandished his arse in the ref's direction to reveal a pristine pair of white pants. Lovely. Not that Alvarez was impressed, mind you. The weekend's best newcomer award surely goes to one of Las Palmas's subs, though: it's a warm welcome back to Spain, from this column at least, for Mario Turd\u00f3. John Benjamin may be doing things right in San Sebasti\u00e1n, but he's just not getting the luck - Alexander Mostovoi got a late, late goal for Celta in the Anoeta to secure a 2-2 draw, denying his side a much-needed three points. Fumbling for the Spanish for \"it's a funny old game, Saint\", John Benjamin just shrugged and said \"that's football\". At least Real\u00b4s nearest rivals also dropped points. Numancia drew 0-0 against Valladolid while Osasuna were beaten 3-1 by on-form Espanyol, with Toni Velamaz\u00e1n scoring two brilliant goals. The side Espanyol thrashed 5-0 last week, Zaragoza, bounced back with a hammering of their own: 6-1 against Rayo Vallecano. Juan Esnaider has proven a real boost for Zaragoza since his transfer from Juve's reserves, and the Argentinian was on the scoresheet again - a wonderful touch setting himself up for the home side's second. And although it's still a month away, attention is already turning to the next derbi instalment. Real Madrid\u00b4s directors have decided to welcome Bar\u00e7a with 80,000 white balloons and ... silence. In contrast to the \"barbarism\" of the Camp Nou\u00b4s reception for Figo, Madrid\u00b4s president Florentino P\u00e9rez rather conceitedly regards the silent treatment as a symbol of Madrid's \"honour\" and \"gentlemanliness\". But after M\u00e1laga's 3,000 fans outvoiced the 65,000 madridistas in the Bernab\u00e9u on Sunday, cynics might suggest that a call for silence is, in fact, simply more realistic. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
