The Department for Children Schools and Families said the rules were clear - teachers had the legal right to confiscate items if they threatened to disrupt lessons. This kind of persistent disruptive behaviour last year resulted in 2,370 permanent and 72,340 temporary exclusions of children from schools. Brennan said: \"This year, while obviously wanting every child to have a great Christmas break, we would rather that parents ensure their children do not use their gadgets in lessons and ideally don't bring them into school at all. Many Christmas presents in the first weeks of the new term get broken at school or have to be confiscated by teachers because they are misused in class. \"It is rightly down to schools to decide how best to deal with electronic equipment being brought in for use in the playground, but we are absolutely clear that when it comes to lessons, noisy toys are not acceptable,\" he added. Chris Keates, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, said: \"Every year some youngsters arrive back at school with MP3 players, mobile phones and electronic games. This can be a real headache for teachers when they are trying to get everyone settled down to start learning. Teachers would be grateful if pupils just brought a pen.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
