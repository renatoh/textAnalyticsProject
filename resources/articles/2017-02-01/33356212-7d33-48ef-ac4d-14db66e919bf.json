The Liverpool manager said before Spurs\u2019 visit to Anfield that he dreamed of 14 consecutive league victories, despite going into the contest with only one win in 10 matches. Henderson, who convened a team meeting at Melwood last Thursday in response to the poor run, insists Liverpool\u2019s performance against Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team indicated Klopp\u2019s target is not as fanciful as it appears. \u201cThat is the aim,\u201d the Liverpool captain said. \u201cFrom day one we\u2019ve said the aim is to win every game. Sometimes it is not possible but that\u2019s our aim and our aim is to do that from now until the end of the season. As players we take the responsibility as we feel as though we have let ourselves down, the manager down and the fans down. Putting in that performance doesn\u2019t make up for it but it is a start and a step in the right direction. Now we have to build on that and keep going. \u201cWe have fantastic quality in the team, great mentality and great character but it is no good me saying that; it is up to us to show that from now until the end of the season.\u201d Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s two early goals against Spurs set Liverpool on course for their first league win since New Year\u2019s Eve but Henderson drew greater satisfaction from how Klopp\u2019s team closed out the game after half-time. The midfielder said: \u201cThe most pleasing thing was second half we were solid, focused, took the sting out of the game and did a lot of good things without the ball. Overall I felt we defended well as a team and attacked well as a team. They couldn\u2019t live with Sadio\u2019s pace in behind. We had a good week\u2019s training leading in and I thought we put everything we had worked on in training into the game and it worked perfectly.\u201d Liverpool head to La Manga on Wednesday for a five-day training camp and Henderson added: \u201cI felt as though we\u2019ve always had confidence and belief but performances over recent weeks haven\u2019t been up to the standard we\u2019ve set ourselves and we\u2019ve been punished. \u201cI thought everyone showed great character against Tottenham and now we have to make sure we are consistent and do it from now until the end of the season. In the Premier League when you win it is always an important result. To win like we did was very pleasing and it will give everyone a big lift.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
