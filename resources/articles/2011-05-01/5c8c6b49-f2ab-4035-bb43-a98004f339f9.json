The Everton manager has been touted frequently as Villa's desired replacement for Houllier, should the Frenchman decide to retire due to health reasons, but he says he has no wish to leave Goodison Park for the Midlands. \"I know nothing about it and they have a really good manager in place who unfortunately is ill at the moment. The last thing he needs to hear is someone talking about his job,\" said Moyes. \"But I'm not interested anyway, so that answers it.\" Everton end their inconsistent season at home to Chelsea and, despite approaching another transfer window where he has to sell to buy players, Moyes says he does not envy Carlo Ancelotti's position at Stamford Bridge. He said: \"Mountains of cash and instability are not something I have had in my managerial career. Everton is the opposite. It is really well run. We don't have bundles of cash, we try and make the best of what we have but we have got stability. The situation I am in at the moment is a good one. I have a really good chairman and I am at a really good club. \"I can control the club to an extent and, though I don't like quoting him all the time, it is one of Sir Alex's comments that a manager has to be allowed to control a club and in the main I do. I don't have the funds but we have tried to keep a stable club.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
