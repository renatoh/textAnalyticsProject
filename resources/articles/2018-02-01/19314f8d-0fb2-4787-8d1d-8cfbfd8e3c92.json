Sullivan revealed plans to improve West Ham\u2019s recruitment structure in an interview before the 2-0 victory against Watford on Saturday and the club\u2019s co-owner has indicated a willingness to give more control to Moyes after several disappointing efforts in the transfer market. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll find ways of churning it back out and trying to make decisions which are right,\u201d Moyes, West Ham\u2019s manager, said. \u201cThey have signed an awful lot of good players here, a lot of good players \u2013 Manuel Lanzini, Marko Arnautovic \u2013 so there\u2019s no criticism, but we\u2019re going to set up something that hopefully gives us another look. It\u2019s going to come a little bit away from the chairman. The chairman is going to try to stand aside a bit from it.\u201d Sullivan has accepted that he needs to invest more in scouting, video analysis and analytics. While he will delegate roles during the restructuring process, he is ready to take a step back once it is in place and Moyes, whose side are five points above the bottom three, expects to have a big say if he agrees to extend his six-month deal at the end of the season. \u201cWe\u2019ve put together some plans,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cThe chairman will be heavily involved as well. The hardest thing is probably getting things done exactly right now because there may be people in jobs and we won\u2019t be able to take them away, so we might have to do it in-house a little bit now.\u201d Moyes, who saw Tony Henry lose his job as West Ham\u2019s head of recruitment following offensive comments about African footballers last month, will consider whether there is a requirement for a figure to bridge the gap between him and Sullivan. \u201cIt could be a head of football operations, could be a head of recruitment, could be a director of football,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we probably won\u2019t make an appointment like that at this time in the season.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
