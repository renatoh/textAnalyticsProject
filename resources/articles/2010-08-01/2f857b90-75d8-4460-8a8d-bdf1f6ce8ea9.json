As he should know, the Representation of the People Act 2000 allows a homeless person to register on the basis of a declaration of local connection.

Andrew Connell Cardiff \u2022 Your correspondent Richard Brunner (Letters, 6 August) is the latest to misunderstand the budget deficit. The deficit is not \"like a mortgage\"; that is the national debt. The deficit is the annual amount by which the debt is rising each year.

Susan Carr Shipston-on-Stour, Warwickshire \u2022 Now that \"the blasted thing\" has appeared in a crossword (4 August) we shall have to learn how to pronounce vuvuzela properly. Should it rhyme with \"Methuselah\", or with \"Hello Sailor\"? Neil Parrack Cheltenham, Gloucestershire \u2022 My neighbour at a North Carolina dinner party said she was a parter. Thinking this must be a term for a part-time worker, I probed to discover what sort of work she did. \"I make parttery,\" she answered (Letters, 9 August). Beverley Charles Rowe London \u2022 Has anyone else noticed the inverse correlation between the amount of money spent on a wedding and the length of the marriage (Report, 7 August)?
