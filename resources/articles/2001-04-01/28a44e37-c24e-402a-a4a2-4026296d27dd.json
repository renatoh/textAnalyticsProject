Not an obvious dilemma for the secretarial job-seeker. But it should be, according to a fast increasing number of occupational psychologists and designers. \"Different office designs suit different people. Get it wrong and it can have an effect on productivity, job satisfaction and general well-being,\" says Kevin Reader of Northampton-based office designers, KRD. Open-plan offices, not surprisingly, suit the more sociable secretary. And as sociability at work has become a strong incentive to a growing number of administrative staff, employers are glad to comply. \"Employees tell us that the workplace community has influenced their decision to join an organisation, to stay with one, and to commit themselves more to their work,\" explains Sally Davis, director at Sanders &amp; Sydney. According to its study, Friendship Works, more and more companies are consequently using office camaraderie to their own advantage. \"Companies are designing bigger offices with fewer partitions and more 'chatting areas' so that they create more motivated staff and better retention.\" For those PAs and secretaries involved in teamwork, open-plan offices also tend to be the firm favourite. \"This may be for single projects - such as organising large conferences or compiling a particular report - or it may be a permanent way of working,\" explains occupational psychologist Eileen Hill. \"Either way, team-working is on the rise because companies have finally come to realise that a combination of skills, experiences and judgments can be more productive than individual input. By giving these teams an open-plan office, they are able to share ideas regularly.\" Indeed, advocates of open-plan offices often praise their focus on communication. \"Managers here used to have that all-too-familiar policy of saying, 'My door is always open'. Eventually we realised that they didn't really need a door - or even an office,\" says a spokesperson for Xerox. As a result, all new Xerox offices in the UK are open-plan, with both managers and their staff located in \"team space\" areas. Michaelides and Bednash, a London media company, takes the \"open plan\" concept even further. \"Everyone in the company works on one huge shared table. It means consultation is not only face-to-face, but also constant. Staff love it,\" explains co-founder George Michaelides. Hot-desking is the latest extension of the \"open-plan\" style of working, with e-business ICL being the latest company to use the practice, which involves everyone agreeing to sit and work wherever there's a space available that day. But hot-desking does not suit everyone, cautions occupational psychologist Bridget Hogg. \"If it is not the employees' choice to get rid of their desks, they may feel they have no space to call their own and suffer quite a severe loss. Without any territory, many people feel unstable and undervalued. In turn, they may be less productive. I would advise any secretary thinking about taking a job where hot-desking is the norm to carefully consider their suitability to this way of working.\" \"Even open-plan offices where there is no hot-desking can have an adverse effect on some secretaries,\" warns organisational psychologist Dr Terry Kellard. \"Studies show that rather than interacting well, people who are naturally 'private' instinctively put up clear barriers to create their own territory\" The result? Your desk neighbour doesn't have much chance of being chatted to, let alone of becoming your new best friend. Secretaries, he says, should think about their behaviours around space in their home lives. \"If you're fanatical about needing your own space at home, the chances are you'll be the same at work.\" Open-plan offices may cause some workers high levels of stress, adds Gary Evans, an environmental psychologist from Cornell University, New York. He divided a group of 40 female clerical workers between a quiet office and one with low office noise and then monitored their behaviour for three hours. He found that workers in the noisy office had significantly higher stress levels and made 40% fewer attempts to solve an unsolvable puzzle. \"We're unsure as to why there is such a dramatic reduction in work performance, but the lack of motivation is probably due to the uncontrollability of noise which can lead some workers to feel that they cannot control their surroundings,\" he explains. Again, consider your tolerance levels at home. Does it drive you mad when the television is on, the kids are playing and your partner is mumbling away to you? Or do you thrive on it? \"Historically, secretaries have worked in isolation and so those who feel that suits them best need not feel like freaks,\" says Eileen Hill. \"In fact, one of the best things about secretarial work is that - unlike many other jobs - they have the choice of working in all kinds of environments.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
