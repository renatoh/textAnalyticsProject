The secret casualties of Jimmy Savile's predatory sexual behaviour, probably hundreds of young and sometimes vulnerable women, have had 30 or 40 years to carry round the painful and humiliating memory of his assaults. Savile himself is beyond the punishment that might have been some compensation for his victims. But another kind of compensation is possible: an investigation that would require the BBC and the other institutions involved to determine whether they tolerated a culture of exploitation, and made them confront the possibility that it might still persist. They need to interrogate their own attitudes. The BBC is, belatedly, now committed to an inquiry. It has promised that it will be chaired by an outsider. That person should be a woman, preferably someone with experience of the impact of sexual abuse on its victims and the reluctance that is commonly felt in reporting it. It should be conducted in such a way that women feel able to describe their experiences. That will mean private sessions and a guarantee of confidentiality. The priority must be to uncover the full extent of the damage. But it must go further. The decision by the Newsnight editor, Peter Rippon, not to broadcast his team's investigation into allegations that Savile had abused girls on BBC premises was defended on the grounds there was no institutional failure to explore. To outsiders, the BBC's own failure to protect the girls from Savile would itself seem an important story of institutional failure. The inquiry needs to examine not just the allegations against the entertainer but the culture of the BBC itself. Toppling Jimmy Savile from his status as national treasure is shattering for millions of people who admired his work. It may be that his good works left the victims of his abusive activities feeling unable to complain. But they are far from alone. The reality is that sexual violence is still not taken seriously enough, and that too often its victims are treated as willing participants. That was how the Rochdale sex grooming gang went uninterrupted for so long. It is why the Metropolitan police's Sapphire sex crimes unit is \u2013 as we have reported \u2013 only now to crack down on pubs and clubs with high levels of sex assaults, despite being in existence for more than 10 years. It may also explain why one of its officers is awaiting sentence for failing to investigate rape allegations properly, while the reporting of rape has fallen sharply, and an Independent Police Complaints Commission report into the unit's conduct is expected next month. Conventional expressions of intent are no longer enough. If anything good can come of the shock of discovery, it must be that a new standard of acceptable behaviour is embedded in the popular imagination."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
