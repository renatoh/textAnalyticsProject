Attempts by previous governments to streamline procurement have had limited success, but the government's head of procurement, John Collington, is confident that centralising government procurement for goods and services ranging from paper clips to consultants can save more than \u00a33bn a year by 2015. Plans to centralise buying were announced in June 2010. The Cabinet Office minister, Francis Maude, said a government procurement team will agree standard contracts, stipulating prices and specifications for nine types of common goods and services, on behalf of all government departments. The Cabinet Office says centralised procurement will hopefully end poor-value contracts, such as those, for example, where government departments and agencies paid between \u00a3350 and \u00a32,000 for the same laptop and between \u00a385 and \u00a3240 for the same printer cartridge from the same supplier. Full details of the scheme have yet to be revealed, but Whitehall officials will be able to buy basic goods and services from an online procurement catalogue. Government departments will retain their own heads of procurement. A review of government spending published last October and carried out by Sir Philip Green, the owner of Topshop and Dorothy Perkins, concluded that much government procurement was inefficient, with departments paying too much for basic commodities and failing to make best use of its buying power. Much of the government's plan to shake up procurement is not new. It will rely on procedures established by the last Labour government in its own efficiency drive. For instance, the government procurement team managing centralised procurement will rely on Buying Solutions, the government buying agency set up in 2001, as well as departmental buying teams. The coalition government's plans to improve procurement were first announced last August, when Collington was appointed head of procurement in the Cabinet Office's Efficiency and Reform Group. So what has been achieved so far \u2013 and how have Whitehall managers and suppliers reacted to tighter controls on government procurement? Collington is upbeat about the progress. In June, the government said it was on track to save more than \u00a31bn over the past year due to tighter spending on discretionary goods and services. Most of the savings were from spending less on consultants, but also through renegotiating contracts with some of its biggest suppliers. The government says it has saved \u00a3800m in IT costs over the past financial year by persuading its biggest suppliers to cut their charges. Collington, who worked for consultancy Accenture before joining the Home Office in 2007 to review its procurement, says plans for centralised procurement are getting \"buy in\" from government departments. Whitehall heads of procurement now meet monthly to discuss buying strategies and share information. This collegiate approach, says Collington, has already improved the co-ordination of government procurement and helped to change a professional culture where departments used to work largely in isolation, focusing on their own budgets and sharing little information. Collective accountability \"The theme of collective accountability has undoubtedly been the biggest change,\" Collington says. \"Previously in government there was always competition between government departments to see who could be the best procurement department [but little co-operation].\" Some of the savings made in procurement will be reinvested in training for civil servants who buy goods and services. As well as making government procurement cheaper, Collington also wants to make it faster. He wants to cut the time it takes to agree a contract with a supplier from the current average of 77 weeks to 40 weeks \u2013 the average time for procurement by the German government. The cabinet has appointed Unipart, a supply chain consultancy, to review its procurement process and suggest ways it can be done quicker, while still complying with European Union regulations on procurement procedures. Faster procurement could save suppliers money by reducing their bidding costs \u2013 partly compensating for any cuts in prices the government persuades suppliers to accept. While some suppliers have been reluctant to comment on the process, others are looking at the potential impact of the changes. Jan Gower, vice-president in IBM's public sector division, says: \"Suppliers spend a lot of time and money dealing with multiple government bodies. If the government saves money in procurement it could be very beneficial to suppliers.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
