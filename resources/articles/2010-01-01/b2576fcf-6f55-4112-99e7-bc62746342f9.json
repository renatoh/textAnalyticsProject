The government has asked councils and highways chiefs to cut salt usage on roads by at least a quarter, amid indications that Britain faces a serious shortage by the end of next week. According to one estimate in Whitehall, local authorities and the Highways Agency are getting through 60,000 tonnes of salt a day \u2013 double the rate for a serious cold snap. Production cannot keep up, running at 15,000 tonnes a day with a stockpile of 320,000 tonnes of salt left until supplies arrive from Spain on 22 January, and the US on 28 January. Under that scenario, and with more heavy snow expected over the weekend, salt stocks would reach a critical level by Friday without a 25% cut in grit distribution. The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils in England and Wales, said the major roads would be gritted. \"Communications within local authorities and regions will be maintained, you will still be able to get around,\" David Sparks, chairman of the LGA's regeneration and transport board, said today. \"At the moment we have done everything we can do and we are in partnership with the government. We are dealing with this problem,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The LGA said councils would take \"prudent measures\" to reduce salt usage while protecting safety and vital services. Measures could include restricting gritting to priority road networks, or to an even smaller network of vital routes if necessary, reducing the amount of salt in treatments and only using grit where snow has already settled to break up snow and ice. A spokesman said: \"As a result of the recommendations by government, councils will increasingly focus gritting on priority one routes and their strategic road network. \"Councils urge drivers to take extreme care on the roads and for information about gritting in their area, people should visit their council's website or contact the council directly.\" The AA said that it had written to the Department for Transport (DfT) and the LGA two months ago to warn that salt supplies could not cope with a repeat of last February's big freeze, when the response of local authorities was heavily criticised. \"This cold snap is longer than forecast but we did have warnings last February,\" said Edmund King, president of the AA. A DfT spokesman said the figures were \"purely speculative.\" He added: \"The overall picture is constantly fluctuating owing to the fact that each local authority across the country has varying supplies of salt and different rates of usage.\" According to one Whitehall source, a key concern is replenishing stocks if there is another deep freeze over the next month. The request to use less grit came as Britain's chill factor was set to drop further, with icy winds sweeping across the country this weekend. The agency, meanwhile, announced it would no longer be gritting motorway hard shoulders to preserve supplies for other areas. England's two main salt mines, in Cheshire and north-east Yorkshire, are working at full capacity, but cannot keep up with the huge demand. Councils have been asked to focus on key routes for emergency services and essential supplies, while sharing their stocks with those authorities which are suffering the most serious shortages. The transport secretary, Lord Adonis, said the current supplies to local authorities were sufficient to last until Tuesday when the government's \"salt cell\" committee next meets to direct the distribution of new supplies. The announcement was seen as \"an admission of failure\" by the Conservatives. The shadow communities secretary, Caroline Spelman, said: \"The government appears to be rapidly losing control of the situation. This is an admission of utter failure. The lessons of last February's extreme weather have not been learned.\" Her comments were rejected by the transport secretary, who held a meeting yesterday with Gordon Brown as well as representatives of the Highways Agency, Network Rail, the Association of Train Operating Companies and National Grid. In the South Wales valleys, Rhondda Cynon Taf council said levels of salt supplies were \"critically low\" and it had taken the decision to prioritise treatment of the highways from today. \"As a result, 40% fewer roads that have so far been treated on a daily basis until today will be salted from now on and resources devoted to what is described as the 'critical network',\" said a spokesman. Train passengers experienced delays and cancellations on some routes, although more operators planned to run a normal weekend service. But Eurostar has cancelled all early morning and late night services between London and Paris this weekend because of freezing temperatures in the Channel tunnel. British Airways cancelled 54 flights at Heathrow yesterday. Flights were diverted and delayed at Belfast's George Best airport, nine easyJet flights were cancelled to and from airports including Gatwick and Luton, while all inward and outbound flights at Dublin airport were suspended yesterday following heavy snow. On Friday night temperatures plunged to as low as -14.5C (6F) in Tulloch Bridge in the Scottish Highlands. At least 25 people are now thought to have died as a result of cold weather-related incidents."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
