Her family, she claims, have \u201ctaken the brunt\u201d of the negative impact of her sudden fame due to her failure to protect them from outside guesswork about the inspiration for her hit BBC Two show, which portrays the misadventures of a young woman known as Fleabag. The character\u2019s strained relationships with an elder sister, Claire, played by Sian Clifford, and her godmother, played by Olivia Colman, are pivotal to the story, as is suppressed grief over a mother\u2019s death and the loss of a close friend. \u201cBecause it\u2019s about family and everything, my family suddenly experienced this really intense focus from people in their lives, and people asking about the show and asking about me, and one of my regrets is I wish I\u2019d seen that coming,\u201d she explains. Waller-Bridge may appear to be riding high, especially after writing half of the first series of the comic thriller Killing Eve, playing a robot in a Star Wars film, working on the script for the next Bond movie, and performing her sellout live show in New York, but she is candid about her continued personal failings. She will reveal on a podcast out this week that she should have taken more responsibility and \u201cmanaged to fortify\u201d her extended family in anticipation of the reactions of the media and the show\u2019s many fans. \u201cThey were actually taking the brunt of the profile of the show getting bigger,\u201d Waller-Bridge says. \u201cThey were being asked all the questions about the show \u2026 Basically, there was just a communication breakdown with my family.\u201d A year ago, Waller-Bridge was the first guest on the popular podcast How to Fail with Elizabeth Day and she has returned to mark the anniversary. Guests on the confessional series are required to admit to failures and, after a series of very public triumphs, Day asked Waller-Bridge to recall errors made during this period in the limelight. The star says her main failure was not shielding her family, although she explains that she had little idea of the amount of attention the show would receive and that, as she was performing in New York when it was being broadcast in Britain, communication was difficult. \u201cI\u2019d underestimated, as we all had, what impact it was going to have and that people were going to want to talk about it so much and like it so much,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I was essentially just so far away from everybody and in a different timezone doing the play \u2026 I hadn\u2019t really connected with my close friends and family when it went out, so they then had this strange explosion of this show happening.\u201d Waller-Bridge, who celebrates her 34th birthday in a fortnight, has an elder sister, Isobel, who is the acclaimed composer behind the music for ITV\u2019s Vanity Fair and BBC One\u2019s The Split, as well as for Fleabag. Her younger brother, Jasper, is a music manager. Her mother, Teresa, is divorced from her father, Michael, who is now married to the artist and designer Rosemary Goodenough. Waller-Bridge concedes that Fleabag invited viewers to engage with her character in an unusually intimate way, but she is clear that she \u201ccontrolled and created\u201d that effect. \u201cThe people closest to me didn\u2019t invite that and there\u2019s so much over-familiarity that comes with that: people assuming that Iso is like Claire. \u201cAnd also people just assuming that so much of it is true. That bleeds into my family\u2019s life when the show\u2019s going out because, weirdly, they are having to defend our family,\u201d she tells Day. Speculation that a female screenwriter could only have drawn such lifelike characters from real life is another irritation. \u201cWomen can make things up too! It\u2019s not all our diaries!\u201d she says. Her inspiration actually came from mining her deepest worries. \u201cOf course I\u2019m drawing on really personal things and things that echo in real life, but I write about my biggest fears. I write about losing my best friend or losing my mum, or not communicating with my dad, or not getting on with his new partner, and all those things are my worst fears: whereas actually my mum\u2019s alive and well, my best friend is alive and well and we have an unbelievable relationship, my relationship with both my siblings is incredible, I get on really well with my stepmother and my dad; but it\u2019s the \u2018what if?\u2019.\u201d The solution, Waller-Bridge suspects, would have been to sit down with her family and explain that \u201cit\u2019s not about you guys, but there\u2019s a few degrees of separation in other people\u2019s minds because it\u2019s so personal and it\u2019s about family, and because there are strange links, like I did have an ex-boyfriend with a motorbike or my stepmother is actually an artist - all those sort of things\u201d. Yet male screenwriters who write about families are not often expected to account for their inspiration and so Waller-Bridge claims she was surprised by the ferocity of speculation about Fleabag. \u201cIt might be to do with the fact I\u2019m a woman, but it also might not be. That autobiographical assumption is something I\u2019m asked about a lot. It is either because the show feels so raw and real that people think it\u2019s real, or it\u2019s because people assume there\u2019s a limit to a woman\u2019s imagination. I\u2019d always rather believe the former.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 2 July 2019 to clarify that Phoebe Waller-Bridge wrote four of the eight episodes of the first series of Killing Eve. The other writers were George Kay, Vicky Jones and Rob Williams."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
