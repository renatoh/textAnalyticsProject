The names of the characters that she played, often a maid or housekeeper, give a flavour of the era and of her style: Ivy McTweed in The McFlannels, Tattie Macintosh in It's That Man Again (ITMA) and, most notably, Aggie McDonald in Life With The Lyons. A tiny - 4ft 10in - but extraordinarily energetic woman, Weir started out in Scottish radio in 1939 and was still acting on television in the late 1990s. She was a regular contributor to radio's Woman's Hour and the old Children's Hour, which was a programme that she particularly loved. She was also a prolific author: her published memoirs ran to five volumes of showbusiness anecdotes, and she wrote an acclaimed and bestselling trilogy about childhood in a Glasgow tenement, Shoes Were For Sunday, Best Foot Forward and A Toe On The Ladder, the last appearing in 1973. Molly Weir was born in the city's Springburn area, and was brought up by her mother and grandmother after the death of her father during the first world war. (Her brother was the broadcaster and naturalist Tom Weir.) She worked as a typist, and through her drive and energy she became the British shorthand and typing champion. After experience in ama teur dramatics, she landed the role of Ivy in The McFlannels and turned professional. In the 1940s she moved to London and joined the cast of Tommy Handley's ITMA, the most popular comedy show of its day, as Tattie. In 1950 she was offered the part that brought her national fame, Aggie the housekeeper in Life With The Lyons, a successful sitcom starring the Hollywood double act Ben Lyon and Bebe Daniels, who had decided to settle in London in the 1930s. Daniels was known for stage musicals such as Rio Rita, and Lyon, who had appeared in the movie Hell's Angels with Jean Harlow, was also an executive for 20th Century Fox when he lived in Britain. In spite of these credentials, the programme, mostly written by Daniels, was a homespun affair based on the tribulations of an American family living in London. It also featured the couple's real-life children, Richard and Barbara. Weir's Aggie was a vital element, and she was one of the few Scottish voices to be heard on radio at the time: warm but down-to-earth, yet bossy and unimpressed by the fame of her employers, who were comically scared of her. Weir, a consummate professional from an early age, tried out various voices when she auditioned for the part, with Lyon and Daniels rejecting each until she reproduced the high, shrill accent of an old lady who had amused Weir and her husband, Sandy Hamilton, when on holiday in Jersey. \"Sandy had advised me to keep it tucked away for future use, because I could imitate it so well,\" she recalled later. \"Now was the moment. 'Och, well, Mrs Lyon, maybe you'd rather I did it like this,' and I screeched in a high falsetto, ending with a laugh like the skirl of the bagpipes. 'That's it. That's the one,' said a delighted Ben.\" Life With The Lyons ran to a remarkable 11 series, eventually ending in 1961, and there were two films, Life With The Lyons and The Lyons In Paris (both 1954). Weir also appeared in five series of a television version of the show that ran from 1955 to 1960, and later established a small-screen presence of her own in the 1970s with her commercials for the household cleaner Flash. Weir's success on radio and television was not matched by theatre or cinema work, although she was effective in small roles in many films, including The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie (1969), Scrooge (1970) and Hands Of The Ripper (1971). Though she and Sandy, who predeceased her, had no children, she loved performing for them. She reached a fresh young audience when she joined the cast of the popular children's television sitcom Rentaghost in 1980. She played the role of Hazel the McWitch for four years. After suffering a bad fall, she spent her final year in a nursing home in Middlesex. \u00b7 Molly Weir, actor and writer, born 1910; died November 28 2004"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
