The Nobel peace prize laureate underwent surgery at the Australian military base after the pre-dawn attack, but the seriousness of his condition was not known. A rebel soldier, Major Alfred Reinado, was killed in the attack that claimed the life of one of the president's bodyguards, who returned fire when the renegade troops struck. In a separate attack, renegade troops also fired shots at the home of the prime minister, Xanana Gusmao, Timorese television said, though there were no reports of any injuries and details were sketchy. During the attack two cars were reported to have driven past the president's house on the outskirts of the capital Dili at about 4.30am and begun shooting. The assaults underlined just how fragile the situation remains in East Timor, the tiny impoverished country that became Asia's newest nation when it gained independence in 2002. A peacekeeping force of Australian troops and international police has helped to stabilise the country, though it was rocked by an outbreak of violence in 2006 when factional violence left 37 people dead and drove another 150,000 from their homes. Reinado had been on the run in the jungle and was wanted for murder charges in connection with the 2006 spasm of violence, but had defied the efforts of Australian troops to capture him. Last November Reinado had threatened to use force against the government. Ramos-Horta, 58, was awarded the Nobel peace prize jointly with Bishop Carlos Belo in 1996. He was one of the leaders of the efforts to win East Timor's independence from Indonesia after it annexed the country in 1975 after the Portuguese withdrew from their former colony. More than 100,000 people were killed in the struggle as Indonesian troops under the brutal regime of the late Indonesian dictator President Suharto, sought to assert their control. Ramos-Horta won a resounding victory in presidential elections last May. The outgoing president and former resistance hero Gusmao then became prime minister after parliamentary elections in July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
