His victory had echoes of the great story of the 1930s, recently made into a Russell Crowe film of that name, when the journeyman James J Braddock became world champion. And it means that all four versions of the world heavyweight title are now held by East European-born fighters, with Vladimir Klitschko the IBF champion, Nicolai Valuev No1 with the WBA and Sergei Liakhovich the WBO belt holder. Already there is talk of Klitschko fighting Maskaev in a title unification match at Madison Square Garden in November. Maskaev, 37, who is from Kazakhstan but was given American nationality two years ago, went into the fight the 13-8 underdog despite knocking out Rahman seven years ago. But he had insisted before the fight that he was sure of victory, that despite his age he would beat Rahman for a second time. As in their first meeting, Maskaev was stronger the longer the fight went on and he eventually sent Rahman to the canvas in the 12th round with a right hand. Referee Jay Nady stopped the contest after 2min 17sec of the round as Maskaev rained punches on his now defenceless opponent. \"This was like I said before, it will be a war,\" said Maskaev after the fight. \"But I believed to the last minute, I knew I was going to win.\" Rahman, 33, admitted afterwards: \"I'm disappointed. I definitely didn't think he'd be walking out of Las Vegas with the title. I think American heavyweights may be a little spoiled. They make too much money too quick. They lose sight of the grand prize.\" Maskaev, whose first win over Rahman was dismissed as a fluke and was conveniently forgotten when the American went on to knock out Lennox Lewis two years later, got his title chance after upsetting the odds to defeat the former European champion Sinan Samil Sam in Germany this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
