The 20-year-old winger, who has shot to prominence in the final months of the campaign, sat out his club's semi-final victory over Sale last weekend after suffering an ankle injury in his sparkling performance for England against the Barbarians the previous week. Scans have revealed there is no break but it appears Simpson-Daniel has severe bruising to his bone and could be out of action for up to six weeks. \"James certainly won't make it this Saturday,\" said the Gloucester coach Nigel Melville. \"We are resting him and giving him treatment but at this stage it looks unlikely he will make the tour. If the injury is what I have been told he will be out for about six weeks.\" South Africa will face Wales in Bloemfontein on Saturday with only five of the side that appeared in their last Test against England seven months ago as their new coach Rudi Straeuli focuses on next year's World Cup. Straeuli has chosen five uncapped players - the full-back Ricardo Loubscher, the half-backs Johannes Conradie and Andre Pretorius, the prop Daan Human and the flanker Warren Britz - and the hooker James Dalton returns after four years in the international. Eight Springboks have retired from international rugby this year. The No8 Bobby Skinstad will captain the side, though Straeuli has said he will appoint the skipper on a match-to-match basis, reversing the policy of his predecessor Harry Viljoen, who told Skinstad he would lead the Springboks to the World Cup. Wales, who announce their side today, have kept a low profile since arriving in Cape Town, where they have been training this week even though the first Test will be played at altitude. \"We have had scouts watching Wales who it appears do not rate our front five or our midfield very highly,\" said Straeuli's assistant Tim Lane, who spent a couple of weeks with Saracens this year. \"Publicly, they have been trying to stoke up our egos but the ploy will not work.\" Ireland open their New Zealand tour against a Divisional XV at Timaru on Saturday with the Sale centre Mel Deane the only uncapped player in their side. South Africa (to play Wlaes on Saturday) : Loubscher; Terblanche, Joubert, Snyman, Paulse; Pretorius, Conradie; Human, Dalton, Meyer, Labuschagne, Matfield, Britz, AJ Venter, Skinstad. Replacements: O le Roux, Rautenbach, Davids, Van Niekerk, Davidson, Jacobs, Russell."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
