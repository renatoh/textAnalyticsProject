These figures are now revisited, 40 years on. They look heartbreakingly young from the original footage, although with a lifetime's agony in their eyes: men prematurely old in spirit. Now we see how age has caught up with two of them; the other has died, and Grigsby talks to his family about the anger and depression they had to live with. This is a sobering film, conveying a sense that time and space stood still for these veterans. It seems that they were frozen emotionally by the war's impact and this film is a rebuke to anyone who assumes that the pain gradually lessens. Perhaps the reverse is true: the pain gets worse, the world moves on and there are fewer people who will understand or want to know. This sad, unhurriedfilm is like a short story by Larry McMurtry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
