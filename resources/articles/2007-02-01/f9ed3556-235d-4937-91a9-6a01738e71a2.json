The Mail on Sunday revealed yesterday that it had seen emails from the show's producer Cactus TV apparently showing that people had still been encouraged to enter the quiz even though contestants had already been picked to take part. Channel 4 confirmed today that the You Say, We Pay quiz had been suspended while it investigates the allegations, which it said were first brought to its attention on Friday. \"We are still investigating the claims made about the competition and don't yet know the extent of any problem,\" a spokesman said. \"But we are absolutely clear that if it's found that viewers have been encouraged to enter the competition after the cut-off point has passed for selecting a potential winner then the channel will offer a full refund to anyone affected. \"You Say, We Pay will not be broadcast as part of Richard and Judy tonight and will not resume until the channel has completed its investigation into how the competition is being run. \"We recognise that some of our viewers will feel they have been misled by the competition and we very much regret that.\" On tonight's show, Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan told viewers of the quiz's suspension, expressing their \"shock\" and \"anger\" over the allegations. Finnigan said: \"Richard and I knew nothing about this until late on Friday afternoon - we were very shocked and also angry on your behalf. We're very sorry.\" Madeley added: \"A huge sorry this has happened. We promise you we will sort it out ASAP and then we can get things back to normal.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
