He was much derided at the time, though in fact his classical pedigree was impeccable. Born in the Ukraine, he studied composition with Glazunov in St Petersburg and established himself as a pianist, specialising in Scriabin, before the US beckoned. His music remained rooted in Russian late Romanticism. Borodin is never far away from his score for The Alamo, while the famous title theme for the TV series Rawhide gravitates, more than once, towards Glazunov. Elsewhere, Rimsky collides with Wagner in The Fall of the Roman Empire, while clotted, Scriabinesque harmonies accompany Ray Milland's terrorisation of Grace Kelly in Dial M for Murder. This fine selection was recorded at the Barbican last year, and is played with terrific panache by the London Symphony Orchestra under Richard Kaufman. Andrew Playfoot, meanwhile, sings Do Not Forsake Me from High Noon as one born to it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
