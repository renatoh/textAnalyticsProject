For one thing, ministers would not have put a well-meaning amateur like Lord Michael (House of Cards) Dobbs in charge of the bill. He was just there to do TV soundbites. For another, government chief whip Lady Anelay (please don't say \"Lady Anal-y\", she told Labour's Lord Lipsey) could have brought the bill back this week, after Labour and Lib Dem peers amended it and it ran out of time last Friday. She didn't because Dave and Tory chairboy Grant Shapps want to print \"THEY denied you a vote on Europe\" posters for 7 May 2015. \u2022 In any case, forcing a bill through using the override powers of the Parliament Acts would require Speaker Bercow to certify that it had been rejected by peers. It hasn't. But hope springs eternal. Cynics noted that Sarah Vine, aka Mrs Gove, wrote a (rightly) sympathetic column in the Daily Mail today about boisterous Sally Bercow's latest tabloid siege. All political wives long \"to throw off the shackles of respectability\", she confessed. Watch out, Michael. \u2022 In the 19th century anthropologists shared an enthusiasm with missionaries to find lost tribes. Nowadays anthropologists like LSE man Matthew Engelke turn their attention on missionaries. In his new book, God's Agents \u2013 a study of the Wilberforce-inspired Bible Society \u2013 he reports precious insights into this Swindon-based tribe. They included unexpected tolerance: for several years the staff included a practising pagan. \u2022 In last week's Edinburgh lecture Mark Carney may have dimmed Alex Salmond's hopes of keeping the English pound after independence. But the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has struck a more brutal blow than the Canadian governor of the Bank of England. Doubts about its \"illegal additives\" have just led exports of Irn-Bru, Scotland's second favourite tipple, to be banned in the chilly dominion. Did they take its \"Made from girders\" slogan literally? \u2022 Jolly convenient when British Sikhs are such conscientious voters in marginal seats that a huge number of documents were shredded in 2009 as unimportant. They might otherwise have shed light on military advice given by Margaret Thatcher's government to Indian forces poised to recapture the Golden Temple at Amritsar in 1984. The shredding allowed Downing Street's Poirot, Jeremy Heywood, to report \"no evidence\" to support wilder theories. But why keep stuff for 25 years, then junk it just five years before the 30-year rule frees it to public inspection? \u2022 The Health Department's \"transparency tsar\" tasked with persuading voters they can safely share their GP records with corporate \"researchers\" is one Tim Kelsey. In less reputable days he was a fearless Sunday Times hack, both loathed and admired. In pursuit of a story that may now haunt him, he once proved he could buy his own medical records. Lurid details of their contents were gleefully passed round the office. \u2022 Permanent campaigner and natural blond, Mayor Boris Johnson, is picking more fights than usual this week. As non-Londoners enjoy the spectacle of pampered metropolitans suffering a Tube strike (they may learn what rotten public transport feels like) Mr Mayor has been goading David Cameron to get tough with the RMT's Bob \"Brazilian\" Crow while taunting Bob to surrender. Not to be outdone, the equally shy ex-MEP Stanley Johnson attacks one of son Boris's transport projects \u2013 HS2. Engineers have just told Stanley the high-speed train's tunnel will pass six metres from his lovely \u00a34m (must be a small one) home in bijou Primrose Hill. \"They said, 'Don't worry, we are going to have ground anchors under your houses and gardens to hold the whole thing up,'\" Stan confided to a protest meeting. The anchors were tested in the sea wall at Fukushima. \"My house shudders if I walk upstairs,\" he wails.
