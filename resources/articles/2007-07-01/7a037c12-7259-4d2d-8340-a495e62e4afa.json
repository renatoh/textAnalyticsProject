For a year now Andrew Strauss has been a batsman in torment, a high achiever for whom success had come readily at first only to find it increasingly elusive as bowlers began to understand his game, and he was required to find countermeasures that took him away from his cut-and-carve comfort zone. Yesterday, though, with five deliveries of the morning session remaining, fate took its eye off the ball. Strauss, diligent at the crease but never comfortable to the off side, drove at Sri Sreesanth, angling across him and down the slope, but failed to get his weight forward into the shot. The ball skewed gently and head-high towards Dinesh Karthik at point, who made to celebrate but instead allowed it to burst through his hands and knock his hat off as if this was a stall at the village fete. In a game that appears destined by impending doom-laden weather forecasts to be severely restricted, that, for Strauss, might have been game over as others, led by Owais Shah, try to knock the door down. If Strauss - 43 then and in a sort of no-man's-land - failed, ultimately, to capitalise by going on to a century, then he got mighty close. He had reached 96 when he opted to advance to Anil Kumble's wrist spin, found himself beaten by the line and, in the desperation of trying to get some wood on it to avoid the inevitable stumping, edged to slip. But it was enough, workmanlike as it had been, to justify the faith shown in him. Shah and the rest will have to wait their turn. Strauss had batted for almost four and a half hours, including initially a heady 60 minutes in which he and Alastair Cook added 76 against bowling that left as much to be desired as had that of West Indies here earlier in the summer, and then, as India began to get a bit more of a grip on things, through a second-wicket partnership of 142 with Michael Vaughan. The England captain, elegant from the off and without undue hindrance, went on to reach 79 before he drove outside off stump at RP Singh, left-arm round the wicket, and was caught behind. Paul Collingwood followed lbw to give Kumble a second wicket and record his first Test-match duck before bad light intervened for the third and final time. England, at 268 for four with a new ball imminent, lost some ground towards the end, but Kevin Pietersen is bedded in on 34, and a formidable total remains achievable. India hauled themselves back but overall theirs was not an inspired performance. England's batting was patchy but still not tested sufficiently until later on. Presumably Sreesanth, Zaheer Khan and RP Singh have played little enough cricket at Lord's to fully understand the intricacies of bowling at Lord's. But the ball swung throughout the day once Vaughan had won the toss, offering the sort of assistance that more attuned performers would have relished. The manner in which all three seamers persisted in bowling on to the pads of the two left-handers Cook and Strauss, only to be flicked and clipped through the on side -runs at a knock-down price - would have been frustrating for Dravid, who set fields to encourage an off-stump attack and was made to look foolish by the inadequacy of his attack. By contrast, each of the off-side boundaries that came in the heady morning session were streaky, edged involuntarily down between wide slip and backward point. Clearly Kumble is going to carry a heavy burden. On days such as this, damage limitation can come in the form of inspirational fielding but sadly that of India yesterday can best be described as quaint: leaden-footed and cumbersome, the domain of portly amateurs with a club tie holding up the Daks. In this regard, oddly, they do have a coach in Robin Singh and on yesterday's evidence he will have a hard time convincing his troops that fielding is not just the bloke who wrote Tom Jones. Against this, both Cook and then Strauss were able to flourish, Cook clipping his first delivery off his hips to the boundary and then being fed such a leg-side diet that he might have suspected subterfuge such was the lack of guile involved. Not to be outdone, Strauss, too, began to cash in off his legs. It was all too easy, so much so that another Cook hundred looked an inevitability until Dravid turned, probably in a measure of desperation rather than inspiration, to Sourav Ganguly's jolly medium pace and gained immediate reward when the batsman played all round a straight one and was lbw on the back leg for 36. The day had begun with a surprise when it was announced that Stuart Broad, who had seemed destined to play ever since Steve Harmison was ruled out, was not picked after all, with Chris Tremlett, excluded from the original squad, put in to make his debut instead. As bolts from the blue, this one was azure. Tremlett has played one-day internationals but none since a particularly tepid display against Australia in Perth last winter. Certainly his height, if not his pace, and his natural length, goes some way towards replicating Harmison's modus operandi, and there is a suspicion that India's batting may be susceptible to shorter bowling. Perhaps he gave Vaughan a working over in the nets. But it all appeared very odd."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
