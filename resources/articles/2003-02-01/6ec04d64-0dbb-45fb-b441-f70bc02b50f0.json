The official decision comes as no surprise after the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, told MPs last month he was \"minded\" to give the US request the go-ahead. However, Mr Hoon did not appear in person in the Commons today to announce his formal confirmation, instead announcing the move in a written answer. In it he said he was \"satisfied that we have been able to take fully into account the views of all interested parties in coming to a decision\". He added: \"I am therefore today replying to the United States secretary of defence, Donald Rumsfeld, conveying the government's agreement to the US request.\" Mr Hoon had told the Commons on January 15 that the government's preliminary conclusion was to allow the upgrade of the North York Moors base for the so-called \"son of star wars\" system. Campaigners and some Labour backbenchers have argued that its use would make Britain a target for any rogue states whose missile attacks on the US it is designed to help foil. The commons defence select committee also criticised the Ministry of Defence for not consulting properly with local people. Mr Hoon today insisted there had been consultation both locally and through parliament, with him giving evidence to the defence committee and replying to a defence debate in the Commons on January 22. He said he had been able now to clarify that the upgrade of the base - once famous for its golfball-style radar domes - would consist of changing computer software and hardware and would involve no new development. He added the changes would not involve any \"change to the external appearance or power output of the radar\". Mr Hoon went on: \"The radar will continue to fulfil its long-established ballistic missile early warning system role, it will continue to be operated and staffed by the Royal Air Force and we will continue to enjoy full access to its data. \"The upgrade does not of itself commit the UK government to any greater participation in the US missile defence programme. It does, however, keep open the prospect of acquiring missile defence capabilities for the UK, should we desire such protection at some point in the future. \"We will continue discussions with the local planning authorities on the detail of the upgrade work.\" The defence secretary said a memorandum of understanding would be negotiated with the US \"to give British industry the best possible opportunities to win work on the US programme\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
