Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, together with organisations including the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) and the National Bereavement Partnership, want the government to use the comprehensive spending review to fund measures addressing particularly traumatic forms of grief. They say unexpected deaths plus lockdown measures have limited the ability to grieve and seek comfort from others, increasing the risk of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) and threatening a mental health crisis. Kathryn de Prudhoe, a psychotherapist and representative of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, who co-wrote the submission to the Treasury, lost her 60-year-old father, Tony Clay, in April. She said: \u201cIt was absolutely terrible, the feeling of being completely helpless and powerless to do anything. I couldn\u2019t go to see him in the hospital. We just had to sit at home and wait for a call once a day. I barely slept for those days\u2026 \u201cWhen my mother came out and told me that they were going to withdraw the life support, we couldn\u2019t hug each other or anything, we just had to sit two metres apart on these two camping chairs outside where all the world could see.\u201d She joined Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice after experiencing difficulty accessing counselling, despite her own professional expertise, eventually paying for a private service. \u201cThe majority of people are floundering and don\u2019t really know where to go or what to access,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is the constant reminder of the virus, the anxiety that people have that they\u2019re going to fall ill, or that another family member is going to die. If we don\u2019t act now, in six months\u2019 time we\u2019re going to have a mental health crisis on our hands as well as well as a viral one.\u201d The submission urges the Treasury to fund helplines, professionally facilitated peer-support and therapy groups, counselling and, for those most in need, trauma-informed psychotherapy. The signatories stress that such services should be \u201cculturally specific\u201d. They also ask for investment in Covid-19 trauma and bereavement training for professionals and volunteers, such as HR professionals, teachers and medical professionals, who, it says, are \u201ckey to our country\u2019s effort to support people bereaved by Covid-19\u201d. Studies suggest an average of five loved ones grieve for every person, leading the submission authors to estimate 260,000 are in mourning across the UK. Assuming half of them may experience PGD and need support at an average cost of \u00a3500, the campaigners are calling for \u00a365m in funding. They say the extra money would relieve pressure on already stretched GPs, while NHS mental health services do not currently accept referrals for PGD. Hadyn Williams, BACP\u2019s chief executive officer, said: \u201cProviding everyone who needs mental health support with access to it also has economic benefits. Unless the government acts now, hundreds of thousands of people will be less productive at work, or may have prolonged absences. This country can afford to support people bereaved by the pandemic. It\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interests that we do so.\u201d Doubts surround when the comprehensive spending review will take place after the Treasury scrapped the autumn budget. The Treasury has been contacted for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
