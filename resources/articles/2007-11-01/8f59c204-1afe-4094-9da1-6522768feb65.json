Worse, another survey suggests that the average length of time spent making lunch is just 11 minutes. Little wonder that most of us revert to buttering bread and adding whatever's in the fridge to make yet another sandwich. But there is an easy way of breaking the monotony: chutney. Make a batch of it at the weekend; it can be stored for months and just one spoonful will give your daily bread that something extra. \"People ask what makes me get out of bed in the morning and the answer is chutney,\" says Guy Tullberg from chutney-makers extraordinaire Tracklements. \"A good chutney certainly brings a bit of light to the day. Chutneys might not change the world but life is certainly a little bit nicer because of them.\" Late autumn is the perfect time to make chutneys. Traditionally, chutneys and pickles were a way of preserving the produce of the harvest beyond its normal shelf life. But while you may not be looking to use up the last of the windfall apples from your orchard, if you want to preserve some of the flavours from warmer seasons to get you through the winter then chutneys are the way to do it. The warm taste of caramelised onions and tomatoes is all the sweeter when it's cold outside. Most chutneys are made by simply sweating veg or fruit in oil (classic autumn chutneys include carrots, chilli and garlic, and beetroot and apple, then adding either malt or cider vinegar, sugar and spices and then simmering it all down and storing in sterilised jars. For a very basic tomato and onion chutney, put 1.5kg peeled tomatoes, 500g of onions and 2 cloves of garlic in a heavy saucepan with a little water and seasoning, bring to the boil, cover with a lid and then simmer for 30 minutes. Add 10g salt, 250g sugar, 200ml of cider vinegar, a teaspoon of paprika, cinnammon and one or two small dried chillies. Bring to the boil, then simmer uncovered and stir frequently until a thick consistency is achieved. Add in a handful of raisins and transfer to sterilised jars and cover. How to make yours taste as though you're an old hand? \"The main ingredient we add to our chutneys is time,\" says Tullberg. \"Some recipes will tell you to take 20 minutes to caramelise onions, but we're looking at doing that over an hour - that way you get the reduction in flavours.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
