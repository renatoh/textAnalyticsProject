The strangest thing about the aftermath of this tumultuous 4-2 defeat at Manchester City was that while his press officer played a blinder, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger began to look unusually gauche. As Arsenal flew back to London and Robin van Persie \"composed\" that icily professional, carefully controlled and utterly ruthless statement expressing such grave disappointment at Emmanuel Adebayor's \"malicious\" stamp on his face, their manager must have rued a lack of similar nous on the field. Wenger's tactics were worryingly naive. Considering that Arsenal could conceivably have won the game and that they played the better passing football that may seem harsh, but time after time they were caught on the counter attack. With better finishing \u2013 from Nigel de Jong and Shaun Wright-Phillips in particular \u2013 City might have scored six or seven. Like almost all the top teams these days, Wenger's men are marvellous at the sort of breathtaking interchanging which sees players swapping positions in a whirl of passing and movement. Yet unlike Chelsea, for instance, they do not rotate roles within the disciplined confines of a midfield diamond. Instead they often attempt something much closer to total football. It is wonderful to watch and it will surely result in several victims \u2013 see Everton on the opening day \u2013 receiving thrashings this season. Even so, to insist on playing like a home team when you are visiting a side boasting the counter-attacking pace of Craig Bellamy and Wright-Phillips is to positively invite a mugging. Arsenal need to recalibrate their timing and learn when to indulge and when to rein in those glorious attacking impulses. While Bacary Sagna and Ga\u00ebl Clichy offered fantastically creative interpretations of the full-back roles, the excellent Bellamy and Wright-Phillips duly took advantage of the resultant gaps as they dribbled down the flanks, thereby segueing City's comparatively rigid formation from a protective 4-5-1 to a formidable 4-3-3. When, midway through the second half, Mark Hughes replaced Stephen Ireland with the further width afforded by Martin Petrov, an Arsenal back line who were already missing Kolo Tour\u00e9 more than they might have imagined they would became badly over-stretched. Even if this summer was the right time to bid Adebayor and Tour\u00e9 farewell it was perhaps not overly clever of Arsenal's powers that be to sell a centre-forward and a centre-half with seemingly burning points to prove to a City side who are pursuing the Gunners' place at the top-four table. On Saturday, Adebayor commanded centre stage \u2013 but Tour\u00e9 was the best defender on view. Then there is the matter of central-midfield enforcement. Alex Song played reasonably in patches here but he is no Patrick Vieira. For long periods, the Cameroonian was thoroughly upstaged by City's anchor, De Jong, who proved responsible for several menacing counter attacks after leaving Cesc F\u00e1bregas looking almost affronted by some of his interceptions. Which rather prompts the question of whether the arrogance clearly visible as Van Persie, F\u00e1bregas and Nicklas Bendtner strut their stuff sometimes translates into Arsenal assuming a collective and dangerously patronising sniffiness about opponents they arguably regard as footballing carthorses. With the odd, F\u00e1bregas-esque exception, Wenger \u2013 who should surely have taken the threat posed by Bellamy far more seriously \u2013 almost invariably goes for sleekly muscular, 6ft-plus thoroughbreds. This near obsession with physique perhaps explains why he did not listen to those who repeatedly told him to sign Shay Given while he could. The former Newcastle goalkeeper lacks the imposing stature which is normally mandatory in his trade, but ample compensation is afforded by his sheer brilliance. Hughes knew what he was doing when he snapped the Irishman up last January. Certainly Given would never have been caught in as poor a position as that which Manuel Almunia occupied when Micah Richards's header ended up dropping into the net via the back of the Spaniard's head. In short, Arsenal could do with a new and reinforced spine. Without one, their manager must devise a strategy capable of insulating them against outrageous hijackings on the counter attack. This is almost a moral imperative. After all, without Wenger's side, the Champions League would be an infinitely poorer place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
