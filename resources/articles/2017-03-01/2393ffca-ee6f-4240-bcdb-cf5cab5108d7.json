In a brief statement on Thursday, federal court justice Robin Camp submitted his resignation over his behaviour while presiding over a 2014 trial into allegations of sexual assault. \u201cI would like to express my sincere apology to everyone who was hurt by my comments,\u201d he added. The Calgary trial made headlines around the world after it emerged that Camp had repeatedly asked the 19-year-old complainant why she had not done more to prevent the alleged rape. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you just keep your knees together?\u201d Camp asked her. Later he told her that \u201csex and pain sometimes go together\u201d. Camp\u2019s resignation came shortly after after the Canadian Judicial Council announced it had wrapped up its 15-month review into the judge\u2019s conduct. The judicial watchdog concluded that Camp had relied on discredited myths, stereotypes about women and victim-blaming during the trial and noted in its report that Camp had at times addressed the complainant \u2013 a young indigenous woman who was homeless at the time of the alleged assault \u2013 in a manner that was \u201ccondescending, humiliating and disrespectful\u201d. Throughout the trial, Camp repeatedly referred to the complainant as \u201cthe accused\u201d. After she told the court that the alleged assault took place in a bathroom sink, Camp asked her why she hadn\u2019t sunk her \u201cbottom down into the basin so he couldn\u2019t penetrate you\u201d. Camp went on to acquit the man accused in the case. The Alberta court of appeal later ordered a new trial in which the 29-year-old accused was subsequently acquitted. In September, an inquiry began looking into whether Camp \u2013 a provincial judge who had been recently promoted to the federal court \u2013 should be removed from the bench. The inquiry heard a remorseful Camp apologise for his remarks. \u201cI was not the good judge I thought I was,\u201d said the 64-year-old. Camp, who was born in South Africa and moved to Calgary in 1998, said he had not understood the changes made to Canadian laws aimed at sheltering sexual assault complainants from discriminatory attitudes. He went to great lengths to demonstrate to the panel that he should keep his job, citing a series of one-on-one counselling and education sessions he had undertaken with feminist scholars to educate himself on sensitivity and sexual assault laws. The inquiry also heard from the female complainant, who said Camp\u2019s remarks had left her fending off suicidal thoughts. \u201cWhat did he get from asking that?\u201d she asked. \u201cHe made me hate myself and he made me feel like I should have done something \u2026 that I was some kind of slut.\u201d On Thursday, 19 of the 23 judges who make up the Canadian Judicial Council recommended that the country\u2019s justice minister remove Camp from the bench. \u201cHe showed obvious disdain for some of the characteristics of the regime enacted by parliament in respect of sexual assault issues,\u201d the council noted in its report. The judge\u2019s conduct, it added, \u201cwas so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role that public confidence is sufficiently undermined to render the judge incapable of executing the judicial office\u201d. Since its creation in 1971, the judicial watchdog has only recommended the removal of two other judges from the bench. Both resigned before being ousted. Recent days have seen mounting calls for another judge to be removed from the bench \u2013 this time a provincial court judge in the east coast province of Nova Scotia \u2013 after he told a courtroom that \u201cclearly, a drunk can consent\u201d, before acquitting a taxi driver accused of sexually assaulting a female passenger who was found half-naked and unconscious in his cab."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
