Spielberg was apparently visiting Cruise on the set of the film in New York when the film's director Cameron Crowe asked him if he would sit in on a scene. The Oscar-winning director agreed and can be observed in the background of a restaurant scene involving Cruise and his Spanish co-star Penelope Cruz. \u0095 British comedian Lee Evans is rumoured to be joining Bill Murray and John Cusack in the black comedy Bump And Run. The \u00a330m movie focuses on a casino host who inherits an American football team from his father. The 35-year-old former stand-up won praise for his performance in the 1995 film Funny Bones and has also won parts in The Fifth Element and There's Something About Mary. \u0095 The Aardman animation team behind hit movie Chicken Run have let slip some details about their next project, The Tortoise And The Hare. Although at least two years away from being released, Peter Lord and Nick Park have described the film as being: \"A sort of Spinal Tap meets Aesop's Fables!\" Michael Caine and comedian Paul Whitehouse are rumoured to be providing some of the voices for the film, which Lord describes as: \"A modern take on the tale with a documentary element to it.\" \u0095 Nightmare On Elm Street director Wes Craven has agreed to direct a new film version of Dr Jekyll And Mr Hyde, according to reports this afternoon. Craven will apparently update the classic horror story and turn it into more of a thriller, giving it a completely different title."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
