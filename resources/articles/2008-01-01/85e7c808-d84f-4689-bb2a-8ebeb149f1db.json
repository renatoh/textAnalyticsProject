As the prospect of utilising the unwanted position in a \u00a34.5bn property disposal or demerger recedes, the company is believed to have turned its attention to assessing the most appropriate strategy for closing out the hedges in a way that will minimise losses. Chairman Roger Carr, who until this episode enjoyed a reputation as one of Britain's most respected businessmen, is expected to face tough questions from furious investors at the annual meeting on Thursday. Investors want to know the exact circumstances in which the hedges were taken out last summer and why associated paper losses have been allowed to spiral out of control for six months. Shareholders were last updated on the hedges (against long-term interest rate rises and long-term deflation) two months ago when M&amp;B reported its full-year figures. The company, which runs more than 2,000 pubs, including the O'Neills, All Bar One and Toby Carvery brands, was forced to book a \u00a3221m non-cash provision against possible losses from the hedge, leaving it reporting a \u00a348m loss for the 12 months to the end of September. A month into the current financial year, the company said paper losses on the hedge had widened to \u00a3260m. And since then, all indicators suggest the markets have again moved against M&amp;B's controversial hedge. With inflation and interest rate expectations both moving against the M&amp;B position, Carr could tell investors on Thursday that the hedges are now showing potential losses in excess of \u00a3300m. M&amp;B was saddled with the unwanted positions last July when the credit crunch derailed its plans to sell most of its freehold properties to a highly debt-financed joint venture to be co-owned by property entrepreneur Robert Tchenguiz and an M&amp;B subsidiary. The board has explained that hedging positions were taken out in the final stages of deal negotiations in order to secure the best terms in the debt-raising process. When the credit crunch arrived all the potential debt investors working on the deal withdrew, leaving the pub company with the unwanted hedge. Since then M&amp;B chief executive Tim Clarke and finance director Karim Naffah have repeatedly said they continued to give \"serious consideration\" to alternative proposals from Tchenguiz concerning a demerger of the group's \u00a35bn property estate into a real estate investment trust (Reit). The hedges, therefore, have been held open in the hope that they can be utilised in an alternative property disposal or demerger. Most analysts now believe the prospect of resurrecting a property deal must be discounted. They note that property yields have risen above M&amp;B's fixed cost of debt and point to substantial falls in the net asset value of many Reits. The pub industry is also facing possibly its most uncertain trading period in memory. One analyst said M&amp;B as an operating company without property assets would be \"among the most financially distressed\" in the current trading environment. Last month, M&amp;B revealed that management pay bonuses had been deferred until the outcome of the hedges had been resolved. Some analysts have suggested this could colour board decision-making on whether or not to press ahead with a property divestment. The group's largest shareholder may also have a conflict of interest. Tchenguiz took out a parallel hedge before the aborted deal last summer, which may leave him with a very different agenda to that of other M&amp;B shareholders if he has not already closed out his position. He holds almost 19% of M&amp;B's shares. A formal decision to abandon a property deal and close the hedge may infuriate Tchenguiz and his many hedge fund supporters on the share register. It is also likely to lead to a rush of sellers. At the very least, it will also mean management lose out on last year's bonuses and, in all likelihood, bonuses for 2008 as well. Despite their otherwise strong reputations, there will also be some calls for Clarke, Naffah and Carr to go."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
