If confronting Willie with mother-from-hell Kathy Bates was one smart creative decision, nothing else \u2013 not the jokes about Cox\u2019s size, not charity supervisor Christina Hendricks\u2019 susceptibility to Willie\u2019s dubious charms, nor the ensuing alleyway pumping \u2013 catches us by surprise this time. Likable Mean Girls pro Mark Waters wrings occasional snickers from a patchy script, but the whole feels tamely conventional: misanthropy passed through the usual Hollywood motions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
