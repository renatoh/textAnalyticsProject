None has a clear plan", "bodyText": "Last night I asked the five candidates vying to be our next prime minister whether they would commit to taking the radical and drastic action necessary to tackle climate change. You may have realised from my reaction to the answers they gave that I was not impressed. As I listened to them fail to answer my question, I kept thinking, \u201cone of these men is going to be our prime minister, the leader of this country in just a few weeks\u201d. And I reflected on what I have been taught about leadership. Aren\u2019t real leaders meant to make decisions to protect the most vulnerable people in our communities? Aren\u2019t real leaders supposed to be brave and courageous? Aren\u2019t real leaders ultimately supposed tell us the truth? But instead we hear them say time and time again that climate change is \u201cimportant\u201d to them, that they will make it \u201ccentral to their programme\u201d if they are in government. At the same time they continue talking about their intentions to expand airports, cut support for renewable technology and set targets that are way too far away to make a meaningful difference. What they fail to realise, as I pointed out on the debate programme, is that climate change is not an issue for tomorrow, it\u2019s an issue of today. Today, there are people all over the world who are already suffering from the devastating consequences of our inaction: droughts, heatwaves, cyclones and wildfires. Today, we\u2019re seeing how countries are treating immigrants and those seeking asylum with intolerance and hatred. Today, we\u2019re seeing the loss of thousands of species of plants and animals, yet those in positions of power continue to absolve their responsibilities. Over the past few months, the YouthStrike4Climate movement has drastically shifted the narrative around the climate crisis, and we\u2019re not going to stop striking until they all commit to taking the necessary action. The UK Student Climate Network has been very clear; declaring a climate emergency is just the first step. We want to totally decarbonise the economy of the UK through a government-led, 10-year mobilisation for a just and prosperous transition which must include the infrastructure needed to benefit all communities and workers. We want to see millions of new well-paid, meaningful and secure jobs created across the UK, in communities like mine, in Glasgow, where we vitally need them. We want a Green New Deal that can protect vital natural habitats. My message is clear, this isn\u2019t a problem for the future, it\u2019s one for today. We need commitments now, otherwise we will continue to hurt countries across the world that are already suffering the worst consequences of climate breakdown. Last night demonstrated that none of the candidates on offer have a clear plan for how to address the climate crisis. Away from the headlines and jibes on social media, this is the opportunity for any one of them to step up and distinguish themselves as a climate leader. I would suggest they listen to the youngest in our society who are not only leading the way but channelling the energy many have for climate action into something tangible. We have the technology and we have the resources, we now need the right leader and some political will. With the UK looking likely to be the host of the next UN climate change conference (COP26) in 2020, it\u2019s the perfect platform. Which of the five candidates to be our next prime minister will lead the UK into those climate negotiations? And which of them has the courage to do the right thing? It\u2019s no understatement to suggest this could literally be our last chance. So, to whoever our next prime minister is, I won\u2019t be impressed until I see more than just words. \u2022 Erin Curtis is a youth striker from Glasgow and part of the UK Student Climate Network \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.
