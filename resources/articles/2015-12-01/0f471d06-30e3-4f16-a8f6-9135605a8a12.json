Preet Bharara, US attorney for the southern district of New York, along with homeland security and immigration officials, had filed a civil forfeiture complaint. The current owner of the fossil consented to returning the skull to Mongolia when informed that it had entered the US illegally. The skull belongs to a Tyrannosaurus bataar, which are indigenous to the Nemegt Basin in the Gobi Desert, in modern day Mongolia. Mongolian law states that all dinosaur fossils found in the country must be surrendered to the government. The law also prohibits exporting artifacts out of Mongolia without permission. \u201cCultural artifacts such as this Bataar Skull represent a part of Mongolian national cultural heritage. It belongs to the people of Mongolia,\u201d Glenn Sorge, acting special agent-in-charge of the New York office of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in a statement. \u201cThese priceless antiquities are not souvenirs to be sold to private collectors or hobbyists.\u201d According to the civil complaint, the skull was shipped into the US in June 2006, and was described as \u201cfossil stone pieces\u201d in US customs documents. It was put up for sale in a California auction house in March 2007 and described on their website as \u201can extremely rare tyrannosaurid skull\u201d which was \u201cthe closest dinosaur relative to the North American King of Dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus rex \u2013 though it thrived on the Eurasian continent approximately two million years earlier\u201d. The skull was sold to an anonymous buyer, who participated in the auction via telephone, for $230,000. When a buyer\u2019s premium was added, the total reached $276,000. Homeland Security Investigations examined the skull in September 2015 and confirmed that it \u201crightfully belongs to the government of Mongolia and had been illegally imported into the United States\u201d. The bataar skull is just the latest fossil the US has worked to return to the Mongolian government. Since 2012, the US has returned many fossils including: \u201cThree full Tyrannosaurus bataar skeletons, a full Saurolophus angustirostris skeleton and another partial Saurolophus, six Oviraptor skeletons, four Gallimimus skeletons, a partial Ankylosaurus skeleton, a Protoceratops skeleton, a composite nest containing miscellaneous dinosaur eggs, and numerous small, unidentified prehistoric lizards and turtles\u201d. \u201cWe are gratified to add the skull of another Tyrannosaurus bataar to the roster of fossils returned to Mongolia,\u201d Bharara said in a statement. \u201cEach of these fossils represents a culturally and scientifically important artifact looted from its rightful owner.\u201d He added: \u201cTogether with our law enforcement partners, we will continue to pursue opportunities to right the wrongs committed when priceless artifacts are stolen.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
