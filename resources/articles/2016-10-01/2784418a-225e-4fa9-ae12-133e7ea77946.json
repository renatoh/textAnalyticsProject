Last week, the New England Patriots\u2019 head coach, Bill Belichick, went on a five-and-a-half minute rant about the Surface Pro, saying he was going back to using pen and paper. He said: \u201cAs you probably noticed, I\u2019m done with the tablets. I\u2019ve given them as much time as I can give them. They\u2019re just too undependable for me.\u201d This week, both 49ers coach Chip Kelly and quarterback Colin Kaepernick weighed in on the iPad competitor, which is used on the sidelines as part of the sponsorship deal. \u201cThere have been times when there are some glitches in them,\u201d Kelly told Mercury News, adding that screen didn\u2019t perform well under the glare of the sun. \u201cSometimes it doesn\u2019t work perfect and you have to shake it a little bit.\u201d Kaepernick added, seemingly in jest, that he has sometimes tapped the device on the side to get the screen to unfreeze. \u201cThat happens every once in a while and they have to reboot it,\u201d he said. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Microsoft and the NFL entered into a five-year, $400m deal in May 2013, making the Redmond-headquartered company \u201cthe official sideline technology sponsor of the NFL\u201d. This means that it\u2019s the official device used by players and coaches to analyze gameplay. The first challenge Microsoft faced was announcers continually referring to the devices as iPads during broadcasts. Then, in October 2014, Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler described the Surfaces as \u201cknockoff iPads\u201d. Crisis management expert Jonathan Bernstein described the situation as a \u201cclassic case of crisis fomented by breakdown between marketing and operations.\u201d \u201cMarketing is going for the quick money and not even asking if the sponsoring system will work well for teams and coaches,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Microsoft, it doesn\u2019t look good to have teams that are unhappy with the device. It\u2019s a much bigger contradiction in terms than to have the average consumer unhappy.\u201d Bernstein believes the situation could have been avoided through better planning, education and training \u2013 of players, coaches and broadcasters. \u201cIf I was Microsoft, I\u2019d be sending very well-coached training teams into each NFL team to get them completely comfortable with the system as quickly as possible,\u201d he said. Despite the criticism, the NFL issued a statement defending Microsoft: \u201cMicrosoft is an integral, strategic partner of the NFL and implementing their technology on our sidelines has increased the efficiency and speed of collaboration between coaches and players to an all-time high. Within our complex environment, many factors can affect the performance of a particular technology either related to or outside of our partner\u2019s solutions,\u201d it said. Meanwhile, Microsoft reported strong sales of the Surface in its most recent earnings call. Revenue reached $926m in the last quarter, up 38% from the previous year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
