The big shadow over Twickenham in recent times has been a shortage of major silverware \u2013 one title since 2003 \u2013 and Stuart Lancaster\u2019s players finally have a chance to earn their rare place in the sun. The Six Nations denouement is not a World Cup final but there is still a defining glint to it. No one understands this better than those awaiting an afternoon that will also test the big-match nerve of Wales and Ireland, as well as the quixotic French. \u201cTiming-wise, this team needs to win something before the World Cup and we\u2019ve put that pressure on ourselves,\u201d said Dylan Hartley, England\u2019s hooker, before his side\u2019s final competitive match before this autumn\u2019s World Cup. \u201cFrom the outset we said we wanted to win it. This will be the biggest [day in an England shirt] for me and I\u2019m sure for the team as well.\u201d Hartley is well qualified to judge, having been involved in England\u2019s anticlimactic title success in 2011. On that occasion they were well beaten in Dublin and, for many, memories of receiving the trophy in their hotel lobby that evening remain hazy. \u201cWhen you ask me if I have won the Six Nations I don\u2019t feel like I have,\u201d said Hartley. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t even come away saying: \u2018Look, we played well.\u2019 Maybe it won\u2019t feel the same until we do the grand slam either.\u201d Hence the desire, after three subsequent runners-up efforts, to get the job done this time. It is impossible to be certain but England may yet require at least a 10-point win should events in Rome and Edinburgh pan out as Wales and Ireland hope. Given that France have conceded two tries in four games \u2013 and could also be champions if they, Italy and Scotland win \u2013 it is not the mathematical formality it might have been had Lancaster\u2019s side been more clinical against Scotland. Nor is it as simple as throwing the ball to Jonathan Joseph and inviting the tournament\u2019s top scorer to add to his four tries in four games. As Hartley rightly insists, getting a forward grip will be fundamental given France\u2019s traditional strength in that area. \u201cWhen people talk about scoring lots of points they confuse that with people like Jonathan Joseph having lots of the ball and doing loads of sidesteps, breaks and no-look passes,\u201d the Northampton captain said. \u201cIn reality it\u2019s about playing the ball in the right parts of the field and applying pressure. If I was the French coming to this game I\u2019d be thinking about how England want to score all these points. I\u2019d make it a set-piece game and slow it down. \u201cAs forwards we\u2019ve said this is the biggest challenge of the tournament, not because of the game but because of their pack.\u201d Graham Rowntree, England\u2019s forwards coach, played against the wily Nicolas Mas and suspects the low-scrummaging French front-row will be a handful, even without the injured Eddy Ben Arous. The visiting bench also contains two tightheads and, while Rabah Slimani has never featured internationally at loosehead, Rowntree has considerable respect for a pack who put the squeeze on Italy last Sunday: \u201cThe DNA of a French forward pack is their set piece. In big games they will go back to that.\u201d In England\u2019s favour, at least, is the venue. The hosts have won their past eight Six Nations matches at Twickenham and, almost 600 years on from the Battle of Agincourt, Rowntree expects the crowd to help shape the latest version of \u201cLe Crunch\u201d. \u201cI want the French to come here and feel they are playing against a nation, not just 15 guys on the field. I am sure the crowd will do that for us. They are going to be very important.\u201d Ultimately, it will depend, contrary to Gallic cliche, on which England team turns up: the composed bunch who won in Cardiff or last week\u2019s wasteful finishers. It is Hartley\u2019s firm belief that he and his team-mates will keep calm: \u201cGone are the days of head-banging and punching holes in walls, although James Haskell does a bit of shadow boxing in the corner. I saw him crush a paper cup once as well.\u201d It will be no joking matter, though, should his team fall short again. A personal hunch, as it was pre-tournament, is that England will narrowly prevail but imagine if three more points are required entering the last minute? Spare a thought, if so, for the referee, Nigel Owens \u2013 returning to Twickenham for the first time since being abused by some idiots during the New Zealand game in November \u2013 and the man contemplating a decisive drop goal. Might it be Danny Cipriani? Fairytale finish or not, brace yourself for an emotional end-game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
