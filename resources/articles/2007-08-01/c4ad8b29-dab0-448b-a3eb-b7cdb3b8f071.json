Officials from the east London club were in Milan last night to discuss with their counterparts the possibility of a loan deal, which Inter are known to favour. Adriano is under contract to the Serie A club until 2010 and they are not yet ready to give up on their investment. The player has struggled for the past two seasons, partly because of injuries, and Inter believe that regular football elsewhere would be beneficial in returning him to top form. They are well stocked with strikers, having signed David Suazo from Cagliari to supplement options that already included Hern\u00e1n Crespo, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Julio Cruz. Eggert Magnusson, the West Ham chairman, has been plotting a spectacular signing throughout the summer and believes that Adriano, who has World Cup experience and a prolific international goalscoring record, would set the pulses racing. Speed is of the essence for West Ham and not only because the transfer window closes on Friday night. Manchester City and Lazio are also interested but not Arsenal, whose manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, revealed yesterday that he had turned down the opportunity to take Adriano on loan. The sticking point for Inter and any interested party concerns the player's reluctance to go on a temporary transfer. \"When I could have left the club, I didn't do it,\" said the 25-year-old, referring to the moves he turned down, to Chelsea, Real Madrid and Barcelona, when he was in top form three years ago. \"Now, if I have to leave, I would only do it on a permanent transfer. But my wish is to remain at Inter. I don't want to go on loan again. I already went once to Parma when it was right for my career. Now, if I must really leave, I'll go and that's it.\" West Ham are casting the net for new players and are one of four English clubs to have declared an interest in Nicolas Anelka, the Bolton striker, who is rated at \u00a310m. Portsmouth, Birmingham and Manchester United are the others. Anelka, who is coveted by Lyon, too, wants to stay in England and is tempted by West Ham, and a return to London, where he played for Arsenal. West Ham have seen an initial bid of \u00a35m for Nicky Shorey rejected by Reading, though Reading have indicated that they would consider selling the left-back, albeit reluctantly, should the Londoners increase their offer by a further \u00a31m. Shorey has under two years to run on his contract and has informed Reading that he will not be committing to a new deal. Despite the formal \u00a35m offer representing a huge profit for a player who joined for \u00a325,000 from Leyton Orient six years ago, Reading will hold out for an improved offer - understood to be imminent - before Friday's closure of the transfer window. Meanwhile Reading are attempting to swap the Korean midfielder Seol Ki-hyeon for the Fulham defender Liam Rosenior, more naturally a right-back but a player who will be capable of filling in for Shorey should he depart this week. Rosenior has been made available for transfer by Fulham's manager, Lawrie Sanchez, and is expected to complete a move to Reading in the next 48 hours.
