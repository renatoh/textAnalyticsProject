Since launching in the UK in spring 2014, we have been busy building a diverse online panel of finance providers. As of January 2016, we have 82 SME lenders and more are in the pipeline. They range from big banks and alternative funders to crowdfunding platforms. Each lender has to go through due diligence with us first. These checks ensure that the necessary permissions are in place, and assess the lender\u2019s interest in working with SMEs. This background effort is paying off: every finance application on our system generates interest from between three to eight lenders. It gives SMEs choice, without having to jump through the usual hoops of waiting for a meeting at a bank, waiting for in-principle decisions, etc. In September 2015, we secured an important partnership with The Leeds City Region Enterprise Partnership (LEP) and professional services firm PwC, providing better access to finance to local businesses. We had some important press coverage, including featuring in the Yorkshire Post and Leeds Living. We are backed by one of the leading investors in the rapidly emerging alternative finance sector, GLI Finance. Establishing strategic partnerships has been our major focus so far. We have a small team of five people; CEO, managing director, head of product and a marketing manager. We are also planning on bringing on board an operational specialist to improve the user experience on our platform. All entries which meet the competition criteria are published and our judging panel select a shortlist of the top three for each category. Winners are announced at an awards ceremony in summer 2016."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
