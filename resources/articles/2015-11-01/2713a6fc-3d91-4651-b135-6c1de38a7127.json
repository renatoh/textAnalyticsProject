The International Association of Athletics Federations was left with little choice but to provisionally suspend Russia on Friday night if it were to retain any credibility at all, but by simultaneously appearing to prepare the ground for the country to come back before the Rio Games, it risks creating the impression an implicit deal has already been sealed. At times this week, it has felt like a complicated dance is already in motion with the IAAF, the International Olympic Committee and the Russian state setting a course where miscreants promise to clean house, are declared compliant with Wada\u2019s code sometime next spring and ushered back into the fold in time for the Olympics. With mixed messages coming out of Moscow \u2013 some immediate cries of a political hit job and bias giving way to a more measured acceptance there are issues that need to be dealt with while ensuring innocent athletes are not punished \u2013 it feels increasingly likely a compromise will be reached. It is one that could involve Russia clearing out a layer of coaches and administrators (a process it began by removing its rotten-to-the-core race walking team from the Beijing world championships), installing a respected overseas figure to run its anti-doping lab and eventually being declared compliant. Dick Pound, the author of the report into Russia\u2019s doping, said this week such an outcome would ensure the rogue operation was brought to heel and effectively gave Russia one last chance to clean up. If it then erred again, he argued, the consequences would be profound. \u201cFool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point you get the stick out and say: \u2018I\u2019m sorry. We identified this. You undertook to fix it. You said you\u2019d fixed it. We found out you haven\u2019t fixed it. You\u2019re out.\u2019 That might apply across more sports than track and field.\u201d Many others, not least those cheated out of medals, would feel a profound sense of injustice that larceny and corruption on such a grand scale did not merit a harsher sanction. While such an outcome may ensure superficial compliance it would contain little punishment beyond global embarrassment. Whether it would be remotely satisfactory to an outside world that may inevitably recoil at the sight of Russian athletes with medals around their necks in Rio or help athletics rehabilitate its tattered image is rather more open to question. Nor would it necessarily guard against us finding ourselves back here in a few years time. Sport cannot be expected to change the political weather in Russia, depose Vladamir Putin or even displace his powerful sports minister, Vitaly Mutko. Given that he was labelled complicit in the revelations by Pound it seems absurd Mutko, who revels in goading the west and is also in charge of the 2018 World Cup organising committee, should be the man to lead the clean-up. Putin aggressively targeted world sport as a means to project soft power and world sport has swooned in return, handing him the 2013 world athletics championships, the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and the 2018 World Cup. Looking at the medal tables in Moscow and Sochi it is clear he had no intention of being embarrassed at his own party. When Thomas Bach, the IOC president, spoke of his belief that Russia could be back in the Olympic fold before Rio if it got its house in order, it was impossible not to recall him lavishly praising the \u201cextraordinary success\u201d of the $51bn Sochi Winter Games in 2014 alongside Putin. Or, in 2013, accepting Putin\u2019s congratulations on his mobile phone almost as soon as he had been elected president. Or at the opening ceremony of the European Games in Baku in June, held against the backdrop of a crackdown on free speech and human rights, where he was sandwiched in pride of place at the opening ceremony between Putin and the Azerbaijan president, Ilham Aliyev. That Bach sees no conflict between brutal suppression of free speech and a culture that allows cheating to flourish is just one of many ironies of the situation. Pound, who revealed a state-sponsored doping system that was jaw-dropping in its scale and complexity, specifically made the point that the current system militates against whistleblowers who want to do the right thing. There has been much talk, from the Russians and the global sporting establishment, of not wanting to punish clean athletes, but, as Pound\u2019s report makes clear, clean athletes in Russia have been excluded from the system. Pound also, wisely, tried to make the point that this is not just about Russia. Already, the risk is this issue becomes refracted through the lens of global geopolitics and turned into a battle a defensive Russia feels it cannot afford to lose. The second part of Pound\u2019s report is likely to turn the spotlight on other nations with deep-rooted issues, such as Turkey and Kenya. Coe will be aware he is creating a precedent in suspending Russia. When I asked him, on the BBC\u2019s Sportsweek programme, the day before Pound\u2019s report was published, whether he would throw Russia out of the sport, Coe said while he would never say never he was minded to rehabilitate from within. Within 24 hours, the weight of Pound\u2019s report had forced him to change his tune and if Coe\u2019s instinct, minted through half a lifetime spent in the corridors and hotel lobbies of this curious class of self-appointed masters of the sporting universe, is towards inclusion over isolationism then Bach takes that credo to its extreme. Bach and Coe first bonded at an IOC Congress in Baden Baden in 1981, when they were members of the first delegation of athletes asked to speak by the president at the time, Juan Antonio Samaranch. Both believe, above all, in maintaining the sanctity and self-determinism of the Olympic movement and that, ultimately, is why pragmatism and the need to keep the show on the road will win out over any wider sense of justice. Whether you feel that stance is correct depends on whether you believe Russia deserves to be punished for cheating or merely forced to comply. If athletes are caught with a banned substance in their systems, however it got there, they will be banned for up to four years. Russia looks likely to get away with a few months. No one should underestimate the scale of the challenge Coe faces in tackling endemic cheating and corruption, while also taking the rest of the world (many of whom backed his rival, Sergey Bubka, in August\u2019s election) with him. He knows there is worse to come once the full details emerge of cover-up allegations against his predecessor, Lamine Diack, the man he said would forever be his spiritual president. For all that he has made a series of missteps in his opening months in charge (refusing to drop his Nike association, his ill-advised tributes to his predecessor), Coe\u2019s position is unenviable. A full disciplinary process will follow the provisional suspension. Coe is understandably keen to ensure due process is followed and Russia given a fair chance to state its case, but if there is any sense a return to international competition is already a done deal before they have even begun to address properly the deep-seated issues uncovered by Pound\u2019s report, the rehabilitation of his sport will seem further away than ever."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
