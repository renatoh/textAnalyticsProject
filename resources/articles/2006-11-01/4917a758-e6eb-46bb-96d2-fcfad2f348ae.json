Is this the white knight that ITV so desperately needs? Or, as Emily Bell, director of digital content at the Guardian, puts it, is it more like seeking protection from the Krays? Does it mean that Stephen Carter, former chief executive of NTL and more recently head of the media regulator Ofcom, is even more a shoo-in for CEO than he was before? Listen to find out. Plenty of other things going on too. We preview the pending launch of al-Jazeera International with Sue Phillips, the network's London bureau chief, who denies that the launch delays were due to anything other than technical difficulties. We hear from Andrew Neil, speaking at the Society of Editors conference in Glasgow, who rails against the general uselessness of the Scottish media - remember, he doesn't run any of it any more. Our press columnist Kim Fletcher is on hand to analyse the concern among some regional newspaper editors about the BBC's incursions on to their patches. Gareth McLean rounds things off with, among other things, a preview of I'm a TV Channel, Get Me A Chief Executive. At least, I think that's what it's called. \u00b7 Details of how to listen to Media Talk, and the Guardian's other podcasts, can be found at theguardian.com/podcasts"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
