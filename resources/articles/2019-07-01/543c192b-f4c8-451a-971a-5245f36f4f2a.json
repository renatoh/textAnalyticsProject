The complaint filed in Los Angeles on Friday, alleges that Disney routinely compensates women less than men, denies women promotions, and classifies female employees in lower job titles that don\u2019t match their responsibilities. The claims have widened a class-action suit filed in April, intensifying pressure on the media and entertainment industry in California to confront longstanding pay disparities. The four plaintiffs who filed on Friday allege discrimination at Disney\u2019s music label, which has signed pop singers such as Demi Lovato, Zendaya and Miley Cyrus; Walt Disney Imagineering, a division that does projects for the company\u2019s theme parks, resorts, cruises and venues; Disney Music Publishing, a recording arm of the company; and a business division responsible for ESPN and Hulu streaming services. The allegations expand a class-action suit filed in April to the corporation\u2019s Hollywood Records music label, its world-famous theme parks and other divisions. \u201cThe unequal pay infects the entirety of Disney,\u201d attorney Lori Andrus told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s not just an isolated incident \u2026 The gap is pretty dramatic.\u201d Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment , but previously said the corporation has \u201crobust pay equity practices and policies\u201d supported by a \u201cspecialized team of compensation professionals and lawyers\u201d. Enny Joo, one of the new plaintiffs, has worked for Disney since 1998 and was promoted to a creative director role in 2000. She has not received a formal promotion since then, the complaint said, even though she was asked to oversee the marketing department\u2019s creative campaigns for the entire roster of Hollywood Records\u2019 artists in 2017. Disney has refused to promote her to vice-president \u2013 the job classification of the man previously in Joo\u2019s role, the suit says. And yet Joo has received \u201cexemplary performance reviews\u201d, in which Joo was described as a \u201creal leader\u201d who is \u201cworking at the top of her game\u201d and manages to \u201cjuggle a very heavy, often very taxing workload with grace and intelligence\u201d. Ginia Eady-Marshall, another plaintiff, is a senior manager for Disney Music Publishing and has been at the company for 15 years. In 2013, she was promoted to a manager role, responsible for overseeing music research, and although the man who previously had the job was classified as a director, Eady-Marshall was not given that title or salary, the suit says. She also later learned that she was earning $25,000 less than some men with her same title, according to the complaint. Becky Train, a media producer in the theme parks division, said she recently learned of at least one other male media producer earning more than $10,000 more than her, despite them doing the same job. The fourth plaintiff, Amy Hutchins, has worked for Disney\u2019s direct-to-consumer business division for 14 years, and as a production supervisor for more than 10 years. Although her boss acknowledged she was doing manager-level work, she has been unfairly passed over for promotions, the complaint alleges. \u201cIt is totally crazy that someone who has been with the company for 15 years can be making tens of thousands of dollars less than her male counterparts,\u201d said Andrus. Some of the women only learned of their unequal salaries because they had male friends at the company who disclosed their wages, the attorney said. \u201cMen are more frequently judged on their potential and not on their performance,\u201d Andrus added. \u201cThe woman is told, \u2018Well you just need to prove yourself,\u2019 even though she\u2019s already been there for 20-something years.\u201d Four of the six named plaintiffs in the case are women of color, though the attorneys have not alleged racial discrimination. The lawyers have now proposed a class-action case that would cover all women employed full-time by the company in California since April 2015. \u201cI love my job,\u201d Eady-Marshall said in a statement. \u201cBut when Disney refuses to reward the hard work of its female employees, and when Disney allows unconscious bias to hold us back, I cannot stand by and do nothing.\u201d The complaint follows high-profile pay gap litigation at Silicon Valley corporations such as Google and Oracle and comes as the Time\u2019s Up movement has increased scrutiny of discrimination in Hollywood. In the UK, Disney revealed earlier this year that it has paid men 22% more on average than women. Disney has also faced growing pressure over its pay of low-wage workers at its Disneyland resort. Earlier this year, Abigail Disney, the great-niece of Walt Disney, publicly criticized the company\u2019s chief executive, Bob Iger, for his $65.6m salary, saying it \u201cdeepened wealth inequality\u201d and was \u201cinsane\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
