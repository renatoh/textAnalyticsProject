It came, by seven wickets, against a scratch side but winning is winning for all that. Faced with the task of making 148 in their second innings \u2013 and, with one exception, largely dodging the rain showers that had been forecast \u2013 they lost Alastair Cook, Michael Carberry (after an excellent half-century) and Kevin Pietersen before reaching three figures. There was some turn for the young leg-spinner James Muirhead to the extent that had they been batting against Shane Warne or Stuart MacGill, life would have been uncomfortable. Muirhead did find something extravagant out of the rough to clatter Cook's leg stump as the England captain shaped to cut, but his is the most difficult of bowling arts and he has yet to add consistency to the promise. Although he had Trott missed at slip as the batsman slashed out at a wide ball (and shortly after Pietersen \u2013 it had to be \u2013 had left him stranded midpitch as he attempted a leg bye, only for the keeper, who had chased and collected, to miss with his shy at the stumps) there were short balls dragged down and the occasional full toss.With the seamers able to offer little in the way of incisiveness once the new ball had softened up, England's task became relatively simple. As the rain clouds gathered Ian Bell decided enough was enough, leathered the seamer Chris Tremain for six over extra cover with the shot of the match and then delicately dabbed him to third man for the winning boundary. It was timed as immaculately as anything he has played all year: seconds later the rain started. The 50 stand between Bell and Trott took 40 minutes. Earlier the England bowlers had finally managed to polish off the Invitational side's second innings for 261, with Steve Finn and Boyd Rankin finishing with three wickets apiece and Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann two each. Quite what England have gained of positive benefit from this match is hard to gauge. Carberry looked in very good order on the final day. His 50, with eight boundaries, can be added to a half-century in the first game and a large technically unbeaten hundred in Hobart (he retired \"out\" after he and Cook had batted through the first day together) and he was dismissed here only as he looked to force the pace, trying to pull a leg-spinner dragged down but not quite sufficiently short, with a high top-edge the result. There was significance in the keeping of Jonny Bairstow. Seven catches in the match, and 48 first-innings runs, for which he worked very hard during his century partnership with Joe Root, are not to be sniffed at. It may yet be that Bairstow has to keep in the first Test should Matt Prior not recover sufficiently from his calf injury. It should not be forgotten that in the English Ashes series Bairstow averaged 29 to Prior's 19. The seam bowling remains more of an issue. Some perspective can be placed on the figures of Finn and Rankin, both of whom would have come into the match with the ambition of making an irresistible case for Test match inclusion, by comparison with those of Stuart Broad \u2013 40-18-69-6. Finn managed most wickets but a current inability to bowl successive deliveries in roughly the same place is hindering him: 49.1 overs brought him eight for 191. He needs to reproduce the bowling that made him formidable in one-day series in India and New Zealand. Rankin appears more economical and did bowl better in the second innings but the relative economy of the first innings was a function of a short length added to width rather than a challenge to batsmen. Produced in the proper way, economical bowling creates pressure (ask Glenn McGrath) but this kind simply reduces it. It means that Chris Tremlett comes strongly into the reckoning despite \u2013 or because of \u2013 not playing, which is not a healthy situation either. England will be hoping that the progress being made by Tim Bresnan towards full fitness is maintained in time for the tour match at Alice Springs which precedes the second Test in Adelaide, or even the three-day match being played, immediately after the first Test, by the Performance Squad now in Brisbane."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
