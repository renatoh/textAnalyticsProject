In keeping with previous Who albums, Tommy featured some crackling electric powerpop (Pinball Wizard, I'm Free), and a few comedy moments for Keith Moon and John Entwistle to let fly (Tommy's Holiday Camp, Fiddle About), but was stretched to double album length to accommodate the album's overriding concept (deaf, dumb and blind kid finds deliverance in amusement arcades). As a pop record it is patchy; as an opera it is badly executed. But it wasn't received that way in a world hungry to move forward. Eighteen months before Tommy was released, the Moody Blues had been asked by their label, Deram, to record an album to showcase the company's latest studio equipment. Days of Future Past was loaded with mellotrons, snatches of poetry and minor key whimsy, wrapped up neatly as a suite to give it added gravitas. It, not Tommy, was the first concept album, but a tad too early \u2013 Tommy shouted louder and got the critical respect."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
