Biden, the former vice-president and an early frontrunner for the Democratic party presidential nomination, abandoned the position he has held for decades amid fierce criticism from his top primary rivals, lawmakers and liberal activists who said the provision disproportionately affected poor women and women of color. \u201cIf I believe healthcare is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone\u2019s zip code,\u201d he told an audience at the Democratic National Committee\u2019s African American Leadership Council Summit in Atlanta on Thursday. At a time when some Republican-led states are passing restrictions that severely curtail access to abortion, Biden said there were too many barriers to women getting care and he could no longer support a policy that restricts funding. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen state after state including Georgia passing extreme laws. It\u2019s clear that these folks are going to stop at nothing to get rid of Roe,\u201d Biden said, referring to the 1973 supreme court decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. \u201cI can\u2019t justify leaving millions of women without the access [and] care they need, and the ability to exercise their constitutionally protected right,\u201d he said. Biden, a devout Catholic, has grappled publicly with his stance on abortion for decades. On Thursday he said he \u201cmakes no apologies\u201d for his previous position, but acknowledged that \u201ccircumstances have changed\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve been working through the final details of my healthcare plan like others in this race and I\u2019ve been struggling with the problems that Hyde now presents,\u201d he said. After his announcement, his campaign said Biden \u201csupports Roe and the right to choose\u201d and that he will \u201ccontinue to fight to protect a woman\u2019s right to make her own personal decisions about her healthcare\u201d. The Hyde amendment is a 40-year-old provision that bans the federal government from paying for abortion care through Medicaid, the government program that provides health insurance to millions of US women of reproductive age. Support for the measure \u2013 which carves out exceptions for rape, incest and instances in which the mother\u2019s life is at risk \u2013 was until recently a noncontroversial position for the Democratic party. In 2016, Hillary Clinton called for its repeal, and, for the first time, that commitment was enshrined in the party platform. Despite Biden\u2019s strong lead in national polls, he has faced skepticism from liberals who believe the 76-year-old is out of step with today\u2019s Democratic party. His previous position on the Hyde amendment also put him at odds with the party platform, which calls for a repeal of the amendment. Reacting to Biden\u2019s reversal on MSNBC, the presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar said she was \u201cnot surprised\u201d. Supporting the Hyde amendment \u201cwould\u2019ve been a big problem for him\u201d, she said. Another Democratic hopeful, Jay Inslee, took aim on Twitter, though did not refer to Biden by name. \u201cI opposed the Hyde Amendment in 1993. I oppose it today. I will never back down,\u201d he wrote. Leaders of major women\u2019s reproductive rights organizations applauded Biden\u2019s shift. \u201cWe\u2019re glad that Joe Biden listened to the voices of millions of women and further clarified his position on the Hyde amendment,\u201d Ilyse Hogue, president of the abortion rights organization Naral Pro-Choice America, said in a statement following Biden\u2019s announcement. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, the Hyde Amendment discriminates against all women but particularly poor women and women of color.\u201d The debate over Biden\u2019s position erupted when a video emerged of an exchange with a volunteer for the American Civil Liberties Union in which Biden appeared to say that he supported repealing the Hyde amendment. The group later posted the video on Twitter. \u201cOur volunteer Nina asked Joe Biden whether, as president, he would lift the Hyde amendment, which bans federal insurance coverage of abortion,\u201d the tweet said. \u201cHe said yes.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign later issued a statement that said the candidate had \u201cmisheard the woman\u201d and thought she was referring to the Mexico City rule, which bans federal aid money from being sent to organizations overseas that perform abortions. Several of Biden\u2019s primary opponents seized on the moment to attack him. \u201cUnder the Hyde amendment, under every one of these efforts to try to chip away or push back or get rid of Roe v Wade, understand this: women of means will still have access to abortions,\u201d the presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren said during a televised town hall on Wednesday, referring to the landmark US supreme court decision which legalized abortion across America. \u201cWho won\u2019t will be poor women, working women, will be women who can\u2019t afford to take off three days from work, will be very young women, will be women who\u2019ve been raped, will be women who\u2019ve been molested by someone in their own family,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do not pass laws that take away that freedom from the women who are most vulnerable.\u201d The presidential candidate Cory Booker, speaking at the summit in Atlanta earlier on Thursday, called the Hyde amendment \u201can assault on African American women\u201d.
