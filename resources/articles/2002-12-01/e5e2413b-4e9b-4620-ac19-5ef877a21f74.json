That was a time when local authorities still had decent architects' departments and it was fashionable, rather than soul-destroying, to work for them. The block is a brilliant piece of compact design for inner-city living. It uses a really ingenious cross section to provide a mix of different sizes of apartments all with their own external front doors, large private balconies and access to communal gardens. This is just the sort of building we should be looking at now, as we work out how to try and provide enough housing in our towns, without destroying the countryside. I first visited it when I was an architecture student. Even then, in the late 1980s, it seemed a world away from what was currently going up - a remnant of a time when postwar architecture still held true to its socialist ambitions. It is not listed and, with current government policy, seems unlikely to get this protection. My blunder is a commercial office building on Lower Thames Street in London - you can see it from the South Bank if you walk along from Waterloo to Tate Modern. Most of the buildings I really dislike are lazy ones, those put up with little thought about anything beyond the bottom line. But that is not the problem here - this was an expensive project. Although, for speed, the fa\u00e7ade was constructed of stone-clad concrete panels, Roman craftsmen were brought over to install lavish marble in the public areas. Yet it is incredibly clumsy, the columns appear out of proportion and it gives no public access to the river. It is an arrogant and vulgar building that does not deserve its fantastic site. \u00b7 Catherine Croft is director of the 20th Century Society."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
