The indie group's frontman is calling his band's fourth full-length a \"world music album\" \u2013 which may be accurate if he's referring to a world that has a west London townhouse filled with smoke clouds and Persian rugs as its epicentre. Still, it's a fun listen, with shades of Ram-era Paul McCartney, the Stones and Shuggie Otis, full of eccentric funk and boogie captured on vintage instruments. It's not just sonically that it seems retro, but in attitude, too: surely no other band in 2014 could deadpan the lyrics to Down (\"down down-diggy-da-da-down-d-down-diggy\") or Dreams (\"I was playing the flute/ In front of the Eiffel Tower/ To a man in a starlight suit\") with such assurance \u2013 not without the help of a great big stash of 60s potions, anyway."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
