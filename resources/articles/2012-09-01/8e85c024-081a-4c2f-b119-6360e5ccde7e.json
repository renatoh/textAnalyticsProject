Crawley, financially stronger than many clubs in League One, are bidding for their third promotion in succession after a swift ascension from the Conference while Michael Appleton's side are looking to avoid a third relegation in four seasons. Ahead of the first competitive fixture between the two clubs, the Crawley manager, Richie Barker, said: \"Portsmouth, a few years ago, were in the Premier League and Crawley were in the Conference. Now we're facing each other on a level playing field.\" It was not level on the pitch after 90 minutes, however, with the home side reduced to nine men and imploding in spectacular fashion as Pompey won 3-0, their first three points of the campaign. It is unlikely Appleton would concur that the two managers are working in similar circumstances. Portsmouth signed 10 players just two days before the start of the campaign, six of whom started Sunday's encounter under the beating West Sussex sun. \"We're in a position where we can only have 20 players,\" he said after the final whistle. \"Every week I find myself looking for defenders, players on loans, constantly. I can't remember how many central defenders have played so far this season and, trust me, it's not through choice.\" Barker may only have been appointed at Crawley in August, but he inherited a squad that is high on confidence and riding the crest of a wave. What Appleton would give for such stability. An error in the matchday programme stated that Portsmouth's record fee for Peter Crouch in 2008 stood at \u00a311bn. That would indeed be quite something but financial turmoil is no stranger to these parts \u2013 the Red Devils have twice been in administration in recent years and were within an hour of extinction in 2006. Now, thanks to the late Bruce Winfield's work, Crawley are on solid ground. There was more than a touch of irony, then, when the home supporters partook in a rendition of: 'Where's your money gone?' Schadenfreude can be a dangerous thing and for a club with such a turbulent past, those Crawley fans would be better served to remember their own troubled history before aiming such jibes at others. This result ended their 100% home record this season, which has included two league wins and an impressive League Cup victory over Bolton Wanderers. Hope Akpan was their standout performer in the middle of the park but he was handed his second yellow card with 20 minutes remaining. The 21-year-old former Everton trainee followed Josh Simpson for an early bath, Simpson having also seen red for two bookable offences shortly before half-time. Crawley's former manager Steve Evans would have turned redder than the Broadfield seats at both decisions. Barker was not as raging in defeat as his predecessor may have been but was unhappy nonetheless. He said: \"We spend hours and hours planning and trying to be as good as we can be, and an inept performance, as far as I'm concerned, has ruined the day for everybody. I thought we were the better side all along. He [the referee, Darren Deadman] has got a previous record of waving yellow cards about and unfortunately he's ruined our day.\" Portsmouth unsurprisingly turned the tide in the second half and the deadlock was broken with a quarter of an hour remaining when the substitute Ashley Harris, a homegrown youngster who had been on the pitch for only four minutes, headed home at the far post following a fine cross from another homegrown talent, Adam Webster. It was an inspired change from Appleton and 11 minutes later Portsmouth led 3-0. Luke Rodgers curled in a delightful free-kick before Izale McLeod scored a third. Appleton added: \"People realise that in the past if you got a move to Portsmouth you'd come and it was a little bit of a pay day, you got a few quid in your pocket. Those days are well gone. I said to the players: 'We're all playing for our careers, we're all playing for our futures' \u2013 everyone, me included. We've been put together under circumstances that shouldn't happen at this level of football. But they've got an opportunity and they understand that.\" For the vociferous 1,634 travelling fans it was a rare afternoon to savour. Portsmouth could feel the sun on their backs and pretend, just for one day, that they were millionaires again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
