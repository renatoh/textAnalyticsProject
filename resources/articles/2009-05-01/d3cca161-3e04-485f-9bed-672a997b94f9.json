But now, following David James's withdrawal from next month's World Cup qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Andorra, the West Ham United goalkeeper is in prime position to show Fabio Capello that he can and should dislodge the Portsmouth man as England's first choice. Green certainly believes that he can be England No1, even when James is fit. \"Oh yeah, of course, you have belief in your own ability,\" he says. \"And it's always been the aim to be the best, to improve to the level of the pinnacle and [playing for England is] certainly it. Whether I get the chance in the next couple of [games] is another matter. If I do then hopefully I'll be ready to take those chances.\" English football is at a curious juncture \u2013 the country hosts the world's most watched domestic league but the Premier League's dominant four clubs do not have an English first-choice goalkeeper between them. Ben Foster is Edwin van der Sar's deputy at Manchester United, but he is injured, and no English keeper is regularly playing Champions League football. This makes Capello's task \u2013 filling what has become England's problem position \u2013 even trickier. Even when James, who is due to have shoulder surgery, is fit, he can make high-profile mistakes. Such problems have affected his international career in the way that they have recently blighted the fortunes of Paul Robinson and Scott Carson. \"It's changed,\" says Green. \"It's not like the old days. In previous times, you'd say: 'Well, who's the keeper for the best team?' And at the time [it'd be] Liverpool, Nottingham Forest when Peter Shilton was there, and teams like that. It's very much different when you can look at it and say, 'He's won a league medal and European Cup, so Shilton deserves to be the England keeper.' \"It doesn't work like that at the moment. Nowadays you say: 'Well, who's the best team in the country? Manchester United. But Van der Sar's not English. So who's the second-best team? Liverpool. [Pepe] Reina's not English. Who's third best? Chelsea. Well Petr Cech's not [English].'\" Green's international experience is limited to a half against Colombia in 2005 and 45 minutes against Spain this season. Both matches were friendlies. In between he \"ruptured a groin which everyone had a good laugh at apart from me\" against Belarus during an England B international in May 2006. That caused him to miss that summer's World Cup and he has been ignored to such an extent since then that he wore gloves inscribed self-depreciatingly with \"England's No6\". \"Not playing is frustrating, you want to play in every game,\" he says. \"But it's the life of a keeper, you'd rather be on the pitch than off. But going away with England, no matter how much going away and not playing is frustrating, it can be taken with a dose of salt as it's at such a high level.\" Capello obviously likes James; until his withdrawal he was the only player to start all 13 of the Italian's games as the head coach. Green, for his part, plays the diplomatic pro when speaking of the 38-year-old, peppering the conversation with references to how \"tremendously well Jamo has done since he came back in\" following Carson's demise during the 3-2 defeat against Croatia in late 2007, which denied England a place at Euro 2008. James has performed well enough, adds Green, for it to be \"not really a question as to who plays. There's no begrudging that but also in the same respect he's pushing 39 and that shows how long you have got as an opportunity to wait\". If Green, at 29, were to be handed his chance in June and takes it, he could realistically be contemplating five to 10 years in the England team. \"Yeah. As I say all you can do is be ready. If someone were to get a chance against Kazakhstan and Andorra then all you can do is give everything you can and if Jamo comes back and plays then so be it. But that person will be wanting to make their mark.\" Green, surely, deserves that chance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
