The Currowan bushfire near Batemans Bay on the state\u2019s south coast has already destroyed at least one home. The fire was downgraded overnight but remained out of control on Wednesday morning and has burned through more than 47,400 hectares. On Tuesday evening the NSW Rural Fire Service said the blaze was spreading quickly towards coastal areas around Pebbly Beach, Depot Beach and Pretty Beach. \u201cThe fire has reached the coast in some areas,\u201d the RFS said. \u201cFirefighters and aircraft are working to protect homes where possible.\u201d Residents in the Kioloa, Pretty Beach, Pebbly Beach, Depot Beach and Durras North areas were told to seek shelter as it was too late to leave. The Princes Highway between Dolphin Point and Batemans Bay was closed in both directions. Some 111 bush and grass fires were burning across NSW on Tuesday evening with more than 54 uncontained. One property west of the town of Kioloa has been confirmed destroyed by the Currowan fire, but it was too dangerous for authorities to carry out further damage assessments. \u201cWe do have some early indications of property being lost or impacted to the west of the area of Kioloa, largely where the fire crossed the Clyde river there yesterday,\u201d RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told the Seven Network earlier on Tuesday. \u201cUnfortunately there\u2019s still a lot of very active fire edge on this fire. \u201cConditions could certainly change if we see the winds influence fire behaviour on that again.\u201d Hunter region An emergency warning for a 200-hectare bushfire at Pelaw Main east of Cessnock in the Hunter region was downgraded to watch and act on Tuesday evening. Residents living on Avery Lane in the suburb of Stanford Merthyr were earlier told to seek shelter from the fire and it was too late to leave. \u201cThe fire has escalated quite quickly,\u201d an RFS spokesman said at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s moving in an easterly direction towards Avery Lane.\u201d The greater Hunter region was under severe fire danger warnings on Wednesday, with very high fire danger for much of the coastal and northern regions. Western Australia An emergency notice was issued for an out-of-control bushfire in Forrestdale, south-east of Perth in Western Australia on Tuesday evening, threatening lives and homes, before being downgraded overnight. Residents were urged to leave for a safer place if the way was clear, or prepare to shelter in their homes in a room with two exits and water such as a kitchen or laundry. The fire was contained and under control by Wednesday morning, but Forrestdale primary school was closed. Help from Canada A group of 21 Canadian firefighters were preparing to travel to Australia to help with the fires over the Christmas period for an expected 38-day deployment. Australian officials submitted an official request to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, based in Winnipeg, on Friday and at the weekend dozens of experienced firefighters from provinces across Canada volunteered to give up Christmas with their families and fly to Australia. \u201cWe are pleased to help the people of Australia as they face these devastating fires, especially since Manitoba has been on the receiving end of help from friends and neighbours when wildfires and other natural disasters hit our province,\u201d the premier of the Canadian province of Manitoba, Brian Pallister, said. Sydney Smoke haze was again forecast for several regions on Wednesday, including metropolitan Sydney, where temperatures were predicted to reach 33C in the west. A fire at Three Mile, in the Hawkesbury region north-west of Sydney, remained out of control and at a watch and act warning level on Wednesday morning. A fire near Cranebrook in western Sydney was also downgraded to \u201cadvice\u201d level after an emergency alert was issued briefly on Tuesday afternoon. Sydney was ringed by bushfires on Tuesday with thick smoke settling in the city\u2019s basin, blown from large bushfires in the Blue Mountains, near Warragamba Dam and in the Hawkesbury area. Air quality was \u201chazardous\u201d in Sydney\u2019s east and south-west on Tuesday afternoon but \u201cgood\u201d in the city\u2019s north-west. Conditions improved slightly on Wednesday morning. Fitzsimmons said a \u201ctemperature inversion\u201d had trapped the smoke in the Sydney basin and the haze was unlikely to lift in the short term. \u201cAll those fires and some a little further afield are all impacting on the smoke inundation around the Sydney basin,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a general westerly pattern to a lot of these winds that\u2019s going to continue to bring smoke right across the Sydney basin, and if we get another inversion effect like we saw this morning, some of that will get trapped.\u201d On Monday NSW police expressed concerns about the number of people deliberately lighting fires amid increased risk. Lake Illawarra Insp Brian Pedersen said it was distressing to see people ignoring the warnings of emergency services. Police spoke to three 12-year-old boys after two fires were deliberately lit in the Lake Illawarra region at the weekend. \u201cWe are urging the whole community to be vigilant and report any suspicious behaviour,\u201d Pedersen said. Two million hectares of NSW land have burned since July in more than 7,000 fires, with authorities calling it the \u201cmost challenging bushfire season ever\u201d. Six people have died and 673 homes have been destroyed. NSW Health said children, older adults and people with heart and lung conditions were the most susceptible to smoke and air pollution. \u201cIf you have asthma or a lung condition, reduce outdoor activities if smoke levels are high and if shortness of breath or coughing develops, take your reliever medicine or seek medical advice,\u201d it said.
