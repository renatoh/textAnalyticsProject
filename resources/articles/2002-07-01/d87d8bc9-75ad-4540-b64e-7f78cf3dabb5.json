Even if your employer has a totally honourable approach to appraisals, treating them as an honest investigation of how your career can be developed for mutual benefit, discretion is advisable. On a properly-designed form all the skills included should be relevant to your work so it's unlikely you would have been offered the job if you did not have some basic competence. That automatically gives you at least a '2'. Base your responses on the understanding that, if you were worse than this, something would have been done about it before now. It's more likely you're too self critical which can come across as a negative trait, hinting at perfectionism or lack of confidence. Take equal care about overstating abilities as that could mean missing out on valuable training. Remember this is a basis for discussion. Where there's something you're uncertain about, put a question mark instead of choosing a level, but to avoid looking indecisive use this sparingly. In many organisations your boss will undertake a similar exercise and part of your appraisal should examine any mismatch in perceptions. The perfect scenario is where your scores largely coincide but with a few areas where he rates you more highly than you do. Competent, self aware but with a touch of humility is most managers' idea of perfection. irenek@lycos.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
