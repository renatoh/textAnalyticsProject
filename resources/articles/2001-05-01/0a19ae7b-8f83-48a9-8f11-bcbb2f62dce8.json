Green is a homespun visionary, the Stanley Spencer of the Pop generation, who decided in the 1960s that since he did not dream in rectangles, he should not paint in them either. Green's highly keyed images have a peculiar intensity, the kind of second sight that comes from contemplating your cabbage patch for too long. He paints his cottage in Little Eversden, Cambridgeshire, and domestic life with his wife Mary with an obsessiveness that makes Spencer's relationship with Cookham look like a passing interest. But it is neither this, nor the Pre-Raphaelite palette, that makes his work so distinctive; rather it is his hallucinatory tendency to twist the very outlines of the paintings askew. At first Green's iconic oils-on-board acquired the spiky gothic profiles of medieval polyptychs, but from the 1970s onwards everything began to fragment. You can witness this happening as four decades of paintings march across the walls of the North Light Gallery, Huddersfield's handsome new contemporary art space. Green's jagged paintings look like the missing pieces of some vast cosmic jigsaw, or broken shards of the world perceived through a distorting mirror. Green overloads these compositions with so many conflicting perspectives that they appear to have buckled under the strain of their own internal energy. In the final room, containing the most recent work, they have sprung off the wall altogether. The chaos of Green's current picture planes has become so uncontrollable that they are totally free-standing. These are extraordinary extensions of Cubist ideas, curious examples of the paradox involved in pressing three-dimensional perception against a two-dimensional plane. Both vibrantly alive and flat as a pancake, Green's recent semi-sculptures are a fitting monument to a singular vision. \u0095 Until July 28.
