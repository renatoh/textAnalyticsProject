Your commendable sentiments about the importance of regional theatre would ring rather more true if the Guardian published more reviews of the existing regional arts performances. Your reviews are heavily weighted towards London theatres and exhibitions. If you really want to encourage audiences and the funding bodies to do more outside the metropolis it would help if you yourself publicised them more. Michael Meadowcroft Leeds \u2022 Your piece by Gina Miller (7 December) was a truly inspiring read from a very impressive woman. I kept asking myself why someone of this calibre is not running for parliament. Hopefully next time. Ivor Mitchell Wellington, Somerset \u2022 Mince pies for pets (Report, 7 December) are fine, but what about some pet food we humans can eat? Stefan Badham Portsmouth, Hampshire \u2022 Me too (Tories fail to face up to the climate crisis, Letters, 7 December). Craig Whittaker failed to turn up to the climate hustings in Calder Valley. Alison Leonard Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire \u2022 One of RH Tawney\u2019s favourite questions was: \u201cDo the English really prefer to be governed by Old Etonians?\u201d Please, on Thursday, can the answer be a resounding \u201cNo!\u201d Mark Walford London \u2022 I don\u2019t know about apostrophes (Letters, 9 December) but there are far more than three potential errors in the two words \u201cVote Johnson\u201d. Malcolm Shifrin Leatherhead, Surrey \u2022 Surely the best modern Christmas song, too little heard, is Bob Dylan\u2019s Must Be Santa (Letters, 9 December)? It contains the line \u201cspecial night, beard that\u2019s white\u201d. Guaranteed to entertain a section of Guardian readers of a certain age, and also has an excellent video to accompany it.
