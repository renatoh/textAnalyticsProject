At the board meeting on 31 March, the FA chairman, Lord Triesman, was challenged by Manchester United's chief executive, David Gill, over where the FA was placed in its preparations for a formal stakeholder consultation. The seven questions \u2013 over issues ranging from debt to club ownership and insolvency \u2013 were posed by the culture secretary, Andy Burnham, last October. But, although the government had expected responses from the FA, the Football League and the Premier League in the new year, there was no document available for the board's consideration at its March meeting. The apparent lack of urgency angered Premier League club representatives, since Triesman had delivered a broadside last year over levels of debt their clubs carry. Triesman's speech to the Leaders In Football conference in 2008 effectively fired the starting gun on the debate on football governance. The government had expected the Premier League's consideration of its questions to be stalled by the billion-pound auction for its television rights. Yet it is the only one of the three major football organisations to have submitted its draft replies to Burnham's department. \"Our response is under ongoing consideration and we hope to be in a position to reply to the secretary of state shortly,\" said an FA spokesman. Yesterday a parliamentary group released its report on governance but it is just a sideshow to Burnham's process. League's board faces own relegation issues The Football League is braced for the outcomes of this season's promotion and relegation battles as it faces an exodus of up to half of its eight board members. The Ipswich Town chairman, David Sheepshanks, will lose his Championship and Football Association board positions if his club contract is not renewed in May. Norwich City's chief executive, Neil Doncaster, will similarly be removed from the FA and League boards if they go down and Sheffield United's Terry Robinson will also quit the League board if they are promoted to the Premier League. Lorraine Rogers, below, the long-serving Tranmere Rovers chairman, will quit the League One club she represents at Gloucester Place at the end of the season after growing disillusioned with the game. Final chance for Setanta Setanta's impressive 1.275m audience for Saturday's FA Cup semi-final between Chelsea and Arsenal came just at the right time for the network as it hopes to persuade its finance-house owners not to pull the plug. The company is in the midst of an internal review about how best to present the rights it holds and to exploit the Freeview platform where it is under-represented. There are also discussions with rights holders such as the FA about how to alter payment schedules, but most crucial will be discussions with its shareholders over refinancing. Strong hopes remain that Balderton Capital, Doughty Hansen and Goldman Sachs will maintain their commitment to a business they have already backed with hundreds of millions of pounds in venture capital. But if they do choose to keep up the expensive battle with Sky for audience share there will be a personal cost to the channel's affable founders, Mickey O'Rourke and Leonard Ryan. They retain a 20% shareholding but should the company survive the capital-raising process that is certain to be slashed. Unfair trade-off for fans The Office of Fair Trading has ignored Manchester United fans' claims that the controversial Automatic Cup Scheme introduced by the Glazer regime at Old Trafford is effectively an abuse of a dominant market position. Manchester United fans are obliged to buy a ticket for every home cup and Champions League match and may opt out only of Carling Cup matches, prompting the original OFT complaint. United insist they have done nothing wrong and the OFT said in its ruling yesterday that in offering a formal appeals procedure if season tickets are terminated for non-payment of cup matches then United are discharging their duties. The OFT added it has finite resources and an expensive courtroom battle over the issue was not a viable option. But that leaves football fans out of pocket \u2013 again. matt.scott@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
