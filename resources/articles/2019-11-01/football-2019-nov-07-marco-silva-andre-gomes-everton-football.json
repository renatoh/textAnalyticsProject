Gomes underwent a successful operation on Monday to repair a fracture dislocation to his right ankle that resulted from Son Heung-min\u2019s foul at Goodison Park. The Portugal midfielder has returned home for a few weeks as he begins a long rehabilitation process but Silva, while reluctant to put an exact time on the recovery, is optimistic Gomes could feature before the campaign is over. The Everton manager said: \u201cWhat\u2019s in our mind, and the feedback I have from our medical staff, is that it\u2019s possible we will see Andr\u00e9 playing again this season. \u201cAfter the surgery and after all the examinations they did, everything went really well and we hope we can see again Andr\u00e9 playing this season. It\u2019s not something we are 100% sure about, but we have good possibilities to do that.\u201d Silva is likely to be without three central midfielders at Southampton on Saturday after Fabian Delph sustained a hamstring injury in the 1-1 draw with Spurs on Sunday. Jean-Philippe Gbamin, purchased for \u00a322.5m in the summer with a view to forming a new first-choice midfield alongside Gomes, is sidelined until the new year after surgery on a damaged thigh muscle. The manager said Richarlison\u2019s disciplinary record proves the forward is no diver but admitted the player needs to \u201cstand more\u201d against physical contact. The Brazil international has been refused penalties against Spurs and Brighton recently but Silva rejects the idea that a reputation for theatrics has counted against Richarlison. \u201cWe are working on him to stand more and to be stronger but Richarlison is not a diver at all,\u201d said Silva. \u201cRicharlison has zero yellow cards for diving. See how many other attacking players in the Premier League have zero yellow cards for diving. There have been two penalties on him in two games but zero penalties. We are working with him to be more strong on contacts but in two seasons he has zero yellow cards for diving.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
