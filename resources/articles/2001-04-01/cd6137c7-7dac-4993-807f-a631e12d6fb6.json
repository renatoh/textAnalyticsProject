Holland play Cyprus in a World Cup qualifier at Eindhoven's Philips stadium but the \u00a319m 24-year-old is expected to start on the bench. It is 13 months since he last represented the Dutch; he will have to make do with a possible late walk-on appearance, and then only if dominance on paper translates into early goals against the Cypriots. Even so, after his injury-wrecked year that represents progress. \"When you get injured and you know you will be out for up to a year, the time ahead looks so long,\" he said. \"Yet sitting here it feels as if it was yesterday. I was determined this wasn't going to be the end of my career. I saw a lot of examples of people who came back from all sorts of injuries and that gave me confidence. Most players did recover.\" It is exactly a year since Van Nistelrooy failed his medical in Cheadle, the legacy of a medial ligament injury sustained in a friendly against Silkeborg that month. Two days later he collapsed in pain at PSV's training ground having ruptured the cruciate ligament in the same (right) knee. \"I rushed things and it cost me a year,\" he says. \"I just wanted to show everybody that I was fit after failing the medical, in particular the Dutch coach Frank Rijkaard. But United wanted to open my knee and that would have put me out of Euro 2000. I really wanted to play in front of the Dutch fans. Maybe I should have gone ahead with the operation; I won't make the same mistake again.\" With his knee clamped in a support brace and the memory of his \u00a318.5m transfer fading fast, he was encouraged by words of inspiration from heady sources. \"Ronaldo offered me great support, which was fantastic,\" Van Nistelrooy recalled. The Brazilian, another former PSV player, has spent the best part of two years injured. \"As soon as he heard what happened he was on the phone to me. I also spoke with Marc Overmars. They told me what to expect with this injury and how to handle it. Mr Ferguson reminded me about Roy Keane and Lothar Matth\u00e4us, who both had injuries like this. Their determination showed me how it was possible to come back with the knee as strong as before.\" Then there was Sir Alex Ferguson. \"I rang to tell him about the injury and he was sympathetic. He told me not to worry. Whatever was wrong, it would be fine. He was a big help. \"A few days after it happened he came over to see me personally. It was incredible that someone who had won so much at such a big club should show me so much warmth. The feeling that the whole club gave me - not just Mr Ferguson - swung my decision. I am just delighted to be able to work with him at all, even if it is for just one year.\" Van Nistelrooy remains a PSV player for now - he will complete his move to Manchester United on July 1 - and the champions will not be obliged to sign him should he suffer a relapse. But Premiership opponents are already fretting over how to nullify the considerable threat that has brought him 60 goals in two injury-free seasons. \"Everyone will see what a quality player Ruud is,\" said the Holland and Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld. \"If you were looking for a centre-forward and you made a list of the qualities required and then took everything together, you would come up with Ruud van Nistelrooy. He is the total striker.\" Despite all the plaudits, the striker is by no means certain of making an appearance tonight. \"He doesn't have the match fitness yet but I picked him in my squad just to stimulate him as a player,\" said the Dutch coach Louis van Gaal. Not that Van Nistelrooy needs further incentive. \"I feel I am back to my best and nobody should worry about my fitness,\" he added. \"I can be the player I was, if not a better one.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
