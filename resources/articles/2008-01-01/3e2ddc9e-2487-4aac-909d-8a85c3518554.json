But you'd need to have that pre-existing love for Serge and David Bielanko's music to draw anything much from their unremittingly competent seventh album proper. The lyrics are never quite specific enough to become universal, instead falling into the trap of Americana solipsism, while the music flirts with blue-collar ramalama rock without ever quite having the courage of its convictions. Of course, this sort of thing is arousing public interest these days - Springsteen is hipper than ever - but the acts whose meaning crosses the Atlantic undamaged by the voyage tend to have something more substantial to offer than this. Disney's theme parks have a Main Street USA attraction; Marah give you a theme park Back Street USA."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
