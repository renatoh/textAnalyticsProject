Speaking to ABC\u2019s Good Morning America on Tuesday to promote a book she wrote with her daughter, Chelsea, The Book of Gutsy Women, the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate was asked about the gutsiest thing she had ever done. \u201cPersonally, make the decision to stay in my marriage,\u201d she said, without elaborating. \u201cPublicly, politically, run for president. And keep going. Just get up every day and keep going.\u201d Chelsea Clinton said she was \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by her mother\u2019s answer. Bill Clinton survived impeachment in the late 1990s over his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Hillary Clinton, then first lady, stood by her husband. She lost the presidency to Donald Trump in 2016 despite winning the popular vote. Hillary Clinton has been on the media circuit for the last few days promoting the book, and has been vocal about the impeachment inquiry into Trump. She said that she supports Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision to start an impeachment inquiry. On the Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Tuesday, Clinton said an impeachment inquiry is now \u201cexactly what should be done\u201d. The Ukraine scandal has had \u201csuch a huge impact because we\u2019ve known for a long time that he was a corrupt businessman who cheated people,\u201d Clinton told Colbert. \u201cTo see him in the office of the president putting his personal and political interests ahead of the national security of our country just pierced through whatever confusion and denial people had.\u201d Clinton repeated her stance on Good Morning America, saying she does not have any concerns about the inquiry because the evidence concerning the Ukraine scandal is so \u201cdramatic and irrefutable\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
