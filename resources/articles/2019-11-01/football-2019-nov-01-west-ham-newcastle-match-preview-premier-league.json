Steve Bruce\u2019s side are capable of defending well but they have struggled in front of goal and need to provide better service for Joelinton, who has only scored once since his \u00a340m move from Hoffenheim. A more ambitious attacking approach is required if Newcastle are to inconvenience West Ham, who are winless since beating Manchester United on 22 September.
