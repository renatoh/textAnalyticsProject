There can be no begrudging the Spaniards their progress on the balance of play in this quarter-final, but Wolves\u2019 pain was deepened by the knowledge that things might have panned out very differently if Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez had not had a penalty saved early on \u2013 or if the referee, or VAR, had spotted encroachment by Sevilla\u2019s Diego Carlos and ordered a retake. Sevilla, the definitive specialists in this tournament, took charge after that let-off but Wolves survived their best efforts and clung to the hope of landing a decisive blow on the counterattack until Ocampos finally exploded their resistance, glancing in a header following a sumptuous inswinging cross from \u00c9ver Banega. It was a shattering way for Wolves to end their 59th match of an exceptionally challenging season and their first European quarter-final since 1972. But when time smooths the rawness of this defeat, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo and his squad can reflect with pride on the feats that took them this far. This Europa League campaign began in July 2019 but, in a deeper sense, it started with the appointment of Nuno in May 2017. Wolves had just finished 15th in the Championship before the Portuguese manager\u2019s arrival, squashed glumly between Barnsley and Ipswich Town. Nuno built an identity that has earned promotion, two top-half finishes in the Premier League and rousing victories on the continent before this honourable defeat to the Europa League\u2019s most decorated club. Although tinged with controversy owing to the failure to punish Carlos for entering the box before Jim\u00e9nez took his penalty, this was a convincing victory for Sevilla, who are likely make Manchester United\u2019s defence strain at least as hard as Wolves\u2019 had to here. Yet things started brightly for Nuno\u2019s side \u2013 or, in one sense, not quite as brightly as feared, since the clouds covering Duisburg meant the temperature was much cooler than forecast. Before kick-off Conor Coady\u2019s rallying call could be heard loud and clear in the almost empty arena. \u201cLet\u2019s do what we do!\u201d hollered the Wolves captain. Thirty-seven seconds later Adama Traor\u00e9 and Jim\u00e9nez did exactly that, combining with charmingly familiar menace, except that the striker\u2019s header from Traor\u00e9\u2019s cross was close enough to the goalkeeper to permit a save. Nuno\u2019s tactics gave Traor\u00e9 the freedom to roam where he pleased as a part of a front two. In the 11th minute Traor\u00e9 gave an awesome demonstration of his threat, collecting the ball inside his own half before turning and sprinting into the opposing box, where Carlos chopped him down in desperation. The defender escaped with a yellow card and his crime paid off when Yassine Bounou read Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s weak penalty and made a comfortable save. The sense of injustice deepened when replays suggested Carlos strayed into the area illegally, although apparently that is not how the Italian official on VAR duty saw it. Three minutes later Rui Patr\u00edcio had to intervene for the first time to deny Suso. It would turn out to be a very busy night for the Wolves goalkeeper as Sevilla started to enjoy the lion\u2019s share of possession. Wolves scrambled hard to keep them at bay. Wolves were grateful to see Youssef En-Nesyri pull a shot wide from 15 yards after Suso opened them up in the 27th minute. As Sevilla found an ominous groove \u2013 all zippy passing and nifty movement -Ocampos went close to opening the scoring, curling just wide. Wolves battened down the hatches and hoped to eke out at least one more chance for Traor\u00e9 to storm forward on the counter. None came and Traor\u00e9 was eventually replaced. Wolves tend to be stronger in the second half but Sevilla never relented enough here to allow Nuno\u2019s side to fight back. Romain Sa\u00efss\u2019s booking on 48 minutes for clunking into Suso seemed a symptom of Wolves\u2019 growing discomfort. Sa\u00efss found himself in more difficulty when Ocampos made a run into the box on his blind side to collect a canny pass and pull the ball back to Jordan, forcing Leander Dendoncker to make a critical block. Two minutes later Patr\u00edcio had to stop En-Nesyri after the striker bounded past three defenders through willpower as much as skill. Then Wolves were reprieved by Jules Kound\u00e9, who headed wide from close range after a cross by Suso. With 20 minutes to go Nuno tried to turn the tables. He introduced Pedro Neto for Jo\u00e3o Moutinho and switched to a three-pronged attack. But Sevilla kept coming and would have scored through a free-kick by Ocampos if not for another save by Patr\u00edcio. Still Wolves hung on, with Coady bawling reminders that just one more chance might be enough for them to prevail. Instead, Sevilla finally converted one of their opportunities, Ocampos breaking the deadlock and Wolves\u2019 hearts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
