Britain's second royal family, the Beckhams, will be moving there later this year. But while Becks is working his magic at Santiago Bernabeu stadium, Real Madrid's home ground, I do worry how Posh is going to keep the kids occupied. So I packed my best designer T-shirts and John Rocha jeans, and took my own small son River to the Spanish capital, for a taste of what it'll be like for four-year-old Brooklyn. This wasn't a trip where we simply went out to the giant theme park on the edge of town; an attraction like that could be absolutely anywhere. We were determined to be true Madrilenos, just like the Beckhams surely will want to be. The only difference between them and us is the size of River's pocket money. But then, many of Madrid's best spectacles turned out to be free. The fan department at El Corte Ingles - Spain's major department store - was a real theatrical show. Gaggles of women of all ages gathered around the huge selection of fans, testing them out in a huge flutter of wrist-waving activity, until the whole department felt as if there were a breeze running through it. Then they tapped the fans firmly against the counter and flicked them open in one quick movement, to see how smoothly they ran. River was entranced and, like Becks, being unafraid of expressing his feminine side, revelled in choosing his very own fan. It was not tasteful (it had a picture of dancing gnomes painted on it), but for less than two euros it brought endless delight for the rest of our stay. River never mastered the fan-fluttering technique, which would have been useful in the city's unrelenting heat. Pursued by the sun, we continually looked for cool places to which we could retreat. Madrid's major attractions - the Prado and Thyssen-Bornemisza museums - may be marble-floored but they aren't child-friendly; at the Prado we were pursued by a warden who told me River could only come in if he remained in his pushchair. But the Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, the city's first contemporary art centre, was a treat. Inspired by the Pompidou Centre in Paris, it's a wonderful blend of old and new - a converted 18th-century hospital with glass lifts perched on the outside. River would have been content travelling up and down in them all afternoon, looking over the sandy rooftops and watching boys play football in the square below. He also really enjoyed the art, particularly Antonio Lopez Garcia's Hombre y Mujer - two life-size, life-like terracotta figures - and playing \"spot the animals\" in Picasso's Guernica. And there is a beautiful shaded courtyard in the centre of the building, with water fountains and a cafe, used as much by local people as gallery visitors, where children are free to run around. Outside the gates of the awesome Palacio Real, River revelled in the municipal children's playground, complete with swings and slides and shaded by an avenue of chestnut trees. So even if your child has suffered being dragged around the royal apartments, they get their chance to play. Every major institution should be complemented by such a facility. Behind the playground, we rested at one of the wrought iron tables of the Caf\u00e9 de Oriente - the perfect place for a beer for me and a batido (a milkshake) for River, the imposing columns of the palace walls acting as an impressive backdrop. Madrid seems to specialise in providing simple children's activities against magnificent historic buildings; River spent over an hour chasing pigeons over the cobbles in 17th-century Plaza Mayor, while I rested at a nearby cafe and sampled more cold cerveza. Drinking and eating is a major cultural activity in which children can indulge in the Spanish capital. River liked to order calamari and patatas bravas, which he called \"big fat chips\", or the little child-sized plates of serrano ham. However, the hours at which such delicacies are eaten are a challenge to a British child: I couldn't find a restaurant that opened for supper before nine o'clock at night. River fell asleep at the table before I could ask him if he wanted any chocolate mousse for dessert. Everything in Madrid runs late. No shops or museums open before 10am, so as children tend to rise early, there is always a couple of hours to kill before the business of sightseeing begins. Before the day became too hot, we headed to the beautiful Retiro park, where we were entertained by early-morning buskers. The fountains were decorated with gargoyles spurting water from their nostrils like an endless stream of snot - guaranteed to entrance any young boy. Then we'd go for a breakfast of churros - a long thin deep-fried stick of plain pastry, like a snake-shaped doughnut, which you dip in thick chocolate. This is the sort of food which children devour, as it's as much about performance as taste. Lunch doesn't start until two, so another mid-morning snack was often necessary. The dried fruit and patatas fritas stalls were the perfect solution; in Madrid, patatas are not chips, but freshly made crisps sold loose in an open bag. I wouldn't have thought of Madrid as a place to take my young boy. But River was content in the city, what with his fan, his batido, and his patatas fritas. Within a weekend, we were proper Madrilenos. So Posh needn't worry. Her kids will feel at home before you can say half-time.
