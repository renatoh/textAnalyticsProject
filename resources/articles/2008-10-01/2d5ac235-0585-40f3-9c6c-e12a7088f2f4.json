Celtic come to Old Trafford tonight with the \u00a34m Scott Brown as their most expensive signing. Manchester United have 11 players who cost as much or more, up to the \u00a330.75m Dimitar Berbatov. This is no sob story since many renowned clubs have less money than Celtic. From manager's office to boardroom, the Scottish champions are run by smart people. With turnover at \u00a375m, the debt of \u00a33.5m is modest. The trouble is that revenue can only stay at those levels if Celtic go on featuring in the Champions League. They have been pulling off that feat under Gordon Strachan. Having never before reached the knockout phase of the tournament in its modern form, the manager has guided them there in each of the last two years. The odds are against a continuation of the sequence, considering Celtic's agonised away form and a 0-0 draw with Aalborg in Glasgow at the start of Group E. Nonetheless, Strachan has achieved much, including three league titles, and part of that success has come through imaginative moves. As with any manager, there were signings that failed, but occasional disappointments can always be overshadowed by a single brilliant coup. Unable to compete with many English clubs, Strachan has excelled by identifying people who would have been ruled out as potential signings for the Premier League. In the case of Shunsuke Nakamura Celtic turned to a well-known individual who had been written off many times. Indeed, Martin Greig's revealing book The Zen of Naka (Mainstream, \u00a316.99) is a chronicle of rejections surmounted. The author, digging deep into the Japanese background, shows us Nakamura in his early teens, crying not because he had been left out of his team but because he had failed to contribute to its success. Soon after, Yokohama Marinos edged him out of their youth system but the midfielder then made his name in schools football instead. When he had ultimately become established with Yokohama in the J League, Philippe Troussier nonetheless overlooked the midfielder for the 2002 World Cup because he reasoned that Nakamura lacked the stamina essential in a Japan line-up designed for defence. The player's reaction was to attempt to improve himself with a move to Italy. His delicate skills made him a misfit in a glum Reggina line-up that survived in Serie A despite scoring a mere 36 goals in the 2004-05 season. Even relegated Brescia were more prolific. That summer, though, Strachan was fascinated by what he saw on television of Nakamura's influence for Japan at the Confederations Cup. His focus, crucially, was on all that Nakamura could do, rather than his limitations. Celtic, in any case, lack the budget to deal in perfection. He cost around \u00a31m, but Celtic were wise enough to pay at least as much again for his image rights. The Champions League stage has made him such a star in his homeland that four Japanese journalists are based in Glasgow simply to report on his every deed. That band of reporters has to be patient because it is Nakamura's habit to go to the gym for up to an hour after home games. He is obsessive on the training ground too, grooving his free-kicks, with his interpreter between the posts, after everyone else has gone. The Celtic manager has written that in terms of sheer ability Nakamura is the best footballer he has ever worked with. There are, of course, additional qualities lacking in him that someone such as Strachan's former Scotland team-mate Kenny Dalglish had in spades. Strachan does not feel that Nakamura would have been suited to the relentlessness of the Premier League and calculates that La Liga might have been the right setting. As it is, the 30-year-old, with his family in mind, may well have his wish granted to return to Yokohama in January should Celtic's interest in the Champions League be over. Two years ago he sent Celtic to the last 16 of the tournament with a free-kick winner against United that an expert such as Matt Le Tissier ranks as being among the five greatest set-piece goals he has seen, if not the best of all. It is unlikely that the visitors will savour tonight's game. Perhaps the action will stay far out of Nakamura's reach. Nevertheless, exploits such as his acquisition and that of the maverick goalkeeper Artur Boruc have kept Celtic to the fore. Strachan's stiff challenge is to go on identifying undervalued assets that are beneath the notice of more affluent clubs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
