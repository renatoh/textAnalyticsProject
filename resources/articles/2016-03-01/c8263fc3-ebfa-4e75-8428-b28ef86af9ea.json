He strikes only rarely in between Games, which explained why going into Saturday night\u2019s session here he had only two world senior titles to his name: the match sprint in 2011 and the keirin in 2013, but he has now taken his world title tally to parity with his Olympic palmar\u00e8s thanks to a victory over Australia\u2019s Matthew Glaetzer which he described as the hardest world title he had ever won. After a seamless passage through to the final, a tactical miscalculation handed the first match to the 23-year-old Australian, one of the trio who won the team sprint world title in 2012. Kenny kept him high up the banking in the second match, held him off going into the penultimate banking, then eased clear up the finish straight to take it to the decider. There, he had to come from behind, holding off \u2013 \u201criding the gap\u201d as the jargon puts it \u2013 before producing a surge of pace up the back straight to clinch the title by over a bike length. It was emphatic, and it puts Kenny\u2019s defence of his Olympic title firmly back on track after it was thrown very much into question by his below-par performance last year, when he failed to make it past the first round; not far behind him in qualifying was his team-mate Callum Skinner who made it as far as the final eight, as if to underline that this is an entire team that looks transformed. \u201cTwelve months ago I remember sitting in the stands [in Paris], watching the semi-final and the final, and it just seemed like a world away,\u201d said Kenny. \u201cI\u2019d been first-round fodder and we\u2019d all gone home early. Now for me to be in the final and for Callum to make the fifth to eighth, we\u2019ve turned it around. We need to make sure we make the most of the next five months. \u201cI think I\u2019m there or thereabouts [compared to] the best I\u2019ve ever been. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever feel like I\u2019m ready for Rio. You always feel like you need to have more time. The key thing is between now and the Games \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter whether we\u2019ve won here or lost \u2013 it\u2019s about making the most of every day. To win in Rio we know we\u2019ll have to go better again.\u201d The flying 200m time trial qualifying round is Kenny\u2019s achilles heel when he is anywhere off his very best, because his relatively small stature means top end power is so hard to find. History suggests that when he starts on the front foot he improves through a tournament, so when he sped in 0.001sec behind Glaetzer on Friday morning, it was probable he would kick on strongly, and so it proved. Incredible as it may sound, this was the first world sprint title in which Kenny had crossed the line first as victor. He was awarded the 2011 gold in January 2012 when the Frenchman Gr\u00e9gory Baug\u00e9 was disqualified for missing out-of-competition drugs tests; he received the rainbow jersey in this velodrome in February that year in a low-key ceremony where the maillot arc en ciel was a junior one dredged up by the UCI. Those who are bemused by the Lancastrian\u2019s inter-Olympic absence should perhaps bear in mind that the margins between gold medals and the minor final for riders placed fifth to eighth are small, and consequently any slight loss of form carries a heavy penalty. Another factor was that, through 2011 and into 2012 he was involved in a constant battle with Sir Chris Hoy for the single GB sprint slot in London; with that incentive gone, it was understandable he might go off the boil. Whatever the reason, Kenny has looked like a man revitalised this week. On Sunday he has a further chance for a medal in the keirin, although he said he was \u201cshattered\u201d after Saturday\u2019s epic; the other British medal chance could well come in the Madison where Mark Cavendish teams up with Sir Bradley Wiggins. Kenny\u2019s fiancee, Laura Trott, has a strong chance of taking her second world title in the omnium after a run of three silver medals. Trott finished third in the opening scratch race, second in the individual pursuit and came second to Sarah Hammer of the USA in the elimination to top the overnight leaderboard, level on points with the American."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
