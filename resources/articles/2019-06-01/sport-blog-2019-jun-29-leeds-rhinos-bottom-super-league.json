Folk from Leeds and Manchester are not too fond of being compared but 45 years on, across the other side of the Pennines, another sporting dynasty is likewise in grave danger of enduring the unthinkable. Leeds Rhinos, Super League champions eight times in 14 seasons between 2004 and 2017, are bottom of the table with 10 games remaining and at serious risk of relegation. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a 10\u2011game shootout with a number of other teams,\u201d admits their interim coach, Richard Agar. How has it come to this for the most successful club of the game\u2019s summer era? The similarities between the Rhinos of today and that relegated United side are startling, and they begin at the top. After Matt Busby\u2019s 24-year reign as manager ended in 1969, United went through four managers in the years leading to relegation. Leeds, coached by only three men throughout their golden era, have had more head coaches than that in the past year alone, culminating in Agar\u2019s appointment following the dismissal of Dave Furner earlier this year. A high turnover of players, coupled with below-par recruitment, has also contributed to Leeds\u2019 decline. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been good enough since Kevin Sinfield and Jamie Peacock left after the treble success of 2015,\u201d says Peter Smith, the Yorkshire Evening Post\u2019s rugby league correspondent for almost two decades. \u201cWhile their rivals have strengthened, Leeds have relied on project signings and youngsters with limited success. The 2017 Grand Final papered over the cracks.\u201d Sinfield now heads up Leeds\u2019s rugby operation, having returned last year, but it is the players who have left Leeds, as well as the ones who have arrived, that make their predicament all the more painful. The Rhinos dropped to the bottom of the table after Hull KR\u2019s victory against Hull FC. That winning Rovers team included three players who won the Grand Final with Leeds two years ago, including Matt Parcell, the hooker who scored the winning try on Thursday having been allowed to leave Leeds on loan 48 hours earlier. The Parcell move is part of a desperate attempt by Leeds to yet again refresh their squad. A cash\u2011plus-player deal has led to the arrival of Robert Lui from Salford, while Shaun Lunt, a Grand Final winner with Leeds in 2012, has swapped clubs with Parcell. Both will make their debuts on Sunday against Catalans. That Lui will wear the No 40 shirt underlines the lack of consistency at a once-dominant club. \u201cI\u2019ve got a job to do but I can\u2019t do it by myself: it\u2019s going to take the whole team,\u201d says Lui. Fortunately for Leeds, perhaps, the bottom seven teams are split by only six points, making any sort of upturn in form in the final 10 weeks enough to secure survival. Leeds\u2019 problems are, however, far more deep-rooted. The England coach, Wayne Bennett, an RFL employee, inexplicably turned up at a Rhinos training session last week to offer guidance. That has caused friction among the sides in the relegation dog fight. Of course, it was said in 1974 that relegation was the best thing to happen to United, a catalyst for brighter times. Nonetheless Rhinos supporters will certainly hope they are not wishing for the same outcome in 10 games\u2019 time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
