The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, threw down the gauntlet to Tory cabinet ministers including Amber Rudd and Philip Hammond, saying they should back Labour\u2019s attempts if they were serious about preventing no deal. If passed, the motion would give MPs control of the parliamentary agenda on 25 June. The same motion could then potentially be used to begin legislation to prevent the UK from leaving the EU without a deal. The motion, which Labour will table during the opposition day debate on Wednesday, has the backing of the former Conservative minister Oliver Letwin and the leaders of the Scottish National party, Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. Unlike typical opposition day debates, the motion, if passed, will be binding, but it will need to secure the support of more Conservative MPs. The plan, which has been a closely guarded secret, comes as several Tory leadership contenders, including Boris Johnson \u2013 who will launch his campaign on Wednesday \u2013 emphasised their willingness to accept a no-deal Brexit. Those who have worked on the plan include leading former and current Conservatives including Nick Boles and Dominic Grieve. A similar move in April by Letwin and the Labour MP Yvette Cooper passed by one vote after 14 Tory MPs rebelled. Conservative sources who have worked behind the scenes on the proposal believe it may be difficult to convince some party colleagues to back a plan based on a Labour opposition day motion, even if they broadly support its objective. \u201cWe have to persuade them that it is currently the only hook available,\u201d one Tory source said. Jonathan Djanogly, one of the Tories who backed Theresa May\u2019s deal but also supported previous efforts by Letwin to stop no deal, said he would support the motion. \u201cAs far as I know the last time that prorogation was used to stymie political debate was just before the civil war. If we have a chance to stop it tomorrow that chance should be taken,\u201d he told the Guardian. Johnson, as well as Andrea Leadsom, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey, have vowed that if they win the Tory leadership, they will take the UK out of the EU on 31 October, regardless of whether or not a deal is in place. Raab has also refused to rule out the option of proroguing parliament in order to force through a no-deal Brexit, something other candidates have said they would not countenance. Starmer said the debate over a no-deal Brexit in the Tory leadership contest had \u201cdescended into the disturbing, the ludicrous and the reckless\u201d, and had forced MPs to act. \u201cMPs cannot be bystanders while the next Tory prime minister tries to crash the UK out of the European Union without a deal and without the consent of the British people,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are taking this latest measure to end the uncertainty and protect communities across the country. My challenge to MPs who disagree either with a no-deal Brexit or proroguing parliament is to back this motion and act in the national interest.\u201d The motion has been signed by Corbyn and the Labour chief whip, Nick Brown, as well as Letwin, the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford, the Lib Dems\u2019 Vince Cable, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Liz Saville Roberts and the Green MP, Caroline Lucas. It is unclear what form those measures to prevent a no-deal departure, which remains the legal default, could take. Some MPs, including the Lib Dem leadership candidate Ed Davey, have suggested making it the legal default that a prime minister must revoke article 50, rather than leave without an agreement. It is unlikely, however, that such a radical move could garner the necessary cross-party backing. Letwin, who has backed Michael Gove in the Tory leadership contest, is likely to face criticism from party colleagues for supporting the move. A Gove campaign source said: \u201cAll leadership candidates will need to win support of colleagues across the party. Michael has always been clear that no deal must remain on the table.\u201d Steve Baker, the deputy chair of the hard-Brexit European Research Group, said Tories including Letwin were risking the chance of a general election that could result in the Conservatives being wiped out by the Brexit party. Baker, who has backed Johnson, said: \u201cOliver Letwin brings closer a general election which could leave Conservatives holding as few as 26 seats. Colluding with this Labour leadership to deny government control of the Commons business is unconscionable for being firmly against the national interest.\u201d Corbyn had hinted his party would restart efforts in earnest to prevent a no-deal Brexit in a speech to Labour MPs on Monday night, a meeting that descended into bitter criticism of the party\u2019s Brexit strategy. He said the party would \u201cnever accept no deal \u2026 nor will MPs from across parliament. We will work on a cross-party basis to block a no-deal outcome.\u201d MPs criticised Labour\u2019s equivocation on another referendum ahead of the European elections last month, which many blamed for the party\u2019s poor performance. Several MPs who spoke out in the tense meeting had not publicly criticised the Labour leader previously, including Marie Rimmer, who told the meeting she had found it difficult to vote Labour, and Lloyd Russell-Moyle, who argued for a members\u2019 ballot on a change of policy and said senior staff determining Labour\u2019s strategy should not be exempt from criticism. The Labour MP Anna Turley said the meeting was \u201cmessy and difficult\u201d. \u201cThe cleaners are probably still mopping up the blood on the carpet,\u201d she said. Turley, who backs a second referendum, told the BBC: \u201cOur results have not been going how we want and we have to be honest about that. It\u2019s no good pretending everything\u2019s fine while the Tories implode. W we are not in the position that we should be and we\u2019ve got to do better.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
