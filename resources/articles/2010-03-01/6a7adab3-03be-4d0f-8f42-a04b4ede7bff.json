I'm not surprised it comes from the HBO stable, which gave us The Sopranos, in which Tony also attends therapy. Paul, played by Gabriel Byrne (pictured), appears to be working from a psychodynamic or psychoanalytical perspective. You get a real sense of him of trying to make his patients think about their feelings. He is keenly interested in how they interpret their experiences, while trying to work out with them what hidden conflicts might be influencing them. What they discover is a surprise to themselves, Paul and the viewer. One thing that might seem out of place is Paul offering his patients tea or coffee. This is not usually done because of the importance of trying to help patients express their feelings, rather than simply responding to an expressed need. In one session, Paul asks his wife to help a teenage patient who arrives drenched from the rain. He goes on to explore the emotional significance of her initial request that he undress her: he thinks someone in her life \"broke the rules\" before, and that she is testing him to see whether he would do the same. Byrne's performance is exceptional: when listening to patients, he gives the sense of struggling to make sense of where they are coming from. The patients are equally credible: they don't simply accept what he has to say; they are three-dimensional characters, who challenge him and argue. I'm not sure you would watch this to see how therapy works; it's the stories themselves that are compelling. But if you are interested in the experiences of others, what contributes to how they feel, and what might alleviate their distress, this is superb. I will be following keenly as the series unfolds \u2013 a version of taking my work home with me."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
