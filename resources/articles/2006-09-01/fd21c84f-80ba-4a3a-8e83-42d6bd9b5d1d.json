But that would be a shame, because you'd be missing out on some pretty decent business advice. Clark began her business, in which kids make their own teddy bears, with a single outlet in 1997 and it now operates in 200 countries. The idea is simple and popular, but even the best ideas won't work unless they're backed by some pretty good marketing and communications nous. Bits of advice dotted around this volume include: don't concentrate on selling but instead focus on connecting with the customer; show a willingness to do any job - that way employees won't feel left out and you'll discover first-hand which processes work and which ones don't; and pay attention to the packaging as well as the core products you offer. Business owners should pay particular attention the part that advises against sitting around waiting for your first break, encouraging would-be entrepreneurs to instead make their own luck. There will be a lot for the beginner as well as the seasoned entrepreneur - and it's structured so that people can easily dip in and out. Worth reading whatever your line of business. Legislation Changes to hit small firms The Forum for Private Business (FPB) is making its members aware of some of the forthcoming maternity legislation that it believes will increase the burden on the smaller organisation. The changes will in effect mean that companies with fewer than five employees will cease to be exempt from maternity obligations; employees won't have to serve a minimum term before being entitled to full rights and employers will be obliged to offer the same or similar work when they return. Nick Goulding, chief executive of the FPB, believes this will hit smaller firms quite badly: \"There is a danger that firms will be left with the costly and difficult task of replacing staff who have entered into the job knowing they will be taking extended leave very early in their employment.\" He welcomed some of the changes, however, including the increase in notice period a worker will have to give if she changes her plans to return or leave after giving birth. The same organisation is warning that the increase in the minimum wage will have the effect of putting prices up. It polled 100 of its small business members and found that 40% thought they would have to put prices up to counter the effect of the change on their overheads. The adult rate will rise from \u00a35.05 to \u00a35.35 per hour from Sunday. Of the companies contacted, 70% said they would not be employing any further staff, and that this was a direct result of the minimum wage increasing. \"The problem with increasing the national minimum wage at a rate greater than the increase in average earnings is there is greater pressure on small employers to give higher pay rises to their higher earners,\" says FPB campaigns manager Victoria Carson. \"If they don't, they are left with disgruntled workers who feel that their skills deserve a greater financial reward than those colleagues who perhaps have fewer skills, but are earning much closer to their pay bracket than ever before.\" Communications Human element still vital In spite of all of the hype, it seems people still aren't buying into the great dream of the \"virtual organisation\". Working on behalf of Cisco, occupational psychologists Pearn Kandola found that trust issues persist when dealing with people who aren't actually in front of you. An over-reliance on email, failure to respond to those emails and the use of inappropriate means of communications have contributed to the breakdown of business relationships, the Psychology of Effective Business Communications study concludes. It suggests a number of strategies and protocols to overcome the difficulties it identifies. These include agreeing to protocols on response times and establishing rules for how often you communicate and through which medium. In spite of claims made about how efficient electronic communications can be, the report finds that an electronic exchange can take up to four times as long as a standard one. It also points out that non-verbal cues can account for 63% of the content of a conversation, and that all of the nuances will be lost using text-only media. Hardware Desktop delights Gadget of the month is the new set of keyboards from Kensington Micro. Comprising one basic model at \u00a318 called the PilorBoard Multimedia Desktop, a wireless version at \u00a332 and a laser desktop set for \u00a348, the range aims to save space while looking modern and stylish. The high-end set is probably the most interesting because it is the first wireless set on the market to offer a laser mouse that is more accurate than the standard sort. The company will be aiming the products squarely at the home business user, and all three keyboards are compatible with both PCs and Macs. As well as the extra features and programmability of the more advanced keyboard, a lot of people are likely to end up choosing it because of the battery life. Kensington claims the mouse will go on for an impressive nine months without the need for new batteries and the keyboard will last even longer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
