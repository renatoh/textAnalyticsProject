The University of London (UoL) spent more than \u00a31.3m on additional security officers, receptionists and other security measures from March 2018 until November last year, amid student demonstrations and over a dozen workers\u2019 strike days. The total until now is likely to be much higher for what protesters say has been the increasingly heavy policing of demonstrations in support of demands for the mainly migrant workers to be brought in-house under equal terms. Video footage has emerged from the second and final day of the occupation last week showing private security guards \u2013 whose company badges were concealed \u2013 removing protesters from Senate House. Asked upon what legal grounds they were being removed, a security guard is heard saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t need powers.\u201d He later said the protesters were trespassing, adding: \u201cThe university have asked us to remove you from the premises.\u201d Ross Tayler, a master\u2019s student at University College London, said: \u201cWe were dragged down the fire escape stairs. It was brutal and intimidating.\u201d After some protesters were removed, another security guard said: \u201cI\u2019ve just spoken with them, they\u2019re saying the meeting is still on the table ... with the vice-chancellor.\u201d Before the eviction, Senate House management were criticised for preventing fellow students from bringing food to the occupiers. In a statement, Justice for UoL Workers said the occupation was a method of \u201cpeaceful escalation\u201d in the campaign\u2019s pursuit of \u201cbasic fairness and workers\u2019 rights\u201d. \u201cApproximately 15 bailiffs with riot shields, stab vests, bolt cutters and concealed equipment broke into the occupation by force,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThey had covered the insignia on their shirts \u2026 and refused to answer any questions including [those about] their legal grounds for eviction. All occupiers received varying forms of injury and were deeply distressed.\u201d It added: \u201cUoL management peered through the window and watched, refusing requests to communicate as their students were violently manhandled on their orders.\u201d However, the video shows a bailiff stating they had permission from the university to be there and does not show any violence by them towards the protesters. Academic staff from across UoL criticised the treatment of the protesters, and that of the outsourced staff. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening at the UoL is part of a broader recognition that cleaners at universities should be treated with dignity and respect,\u201d said Dr Jamie Woodcock, a visiting academic at Goldsmiths\u2019 Institute of Management Studies. \u201cI\u2019ve been completely astonished by the university\u2019s response to the protests, putting up barriers around entrances and hiring private security. It looks like something out of an oppressive regime that the university would condemn. Why are publicly funded universities spending money attacking non-violent protesters?\u201d He added that evidence suggested that bringing cleaners in-house was cost-effective and outsourcing to an external company might not save money. \u201cThe cost of paying cleaners more is being dwarfed by the huge amount spent on policing protests,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shows this is a question of the university not wanting to bow to pressure from students and staff. They are making a political choice.\u201d Leo Zeilig, a senior research fellow at the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, said events at UoL were part of a global movement to kick back against outsourcing. \u201cI have witnessed private security guards hired specifically for their muscle who have used heavy-handed aggression and physical intimidation at legitimate, peaceful protests with workers and students at the university,\u201d he said. \u201cI have colleagues in Sydney who know about the situation at the UoL. I\u2019m ashamed of how the university has been treating its outsourced workers, while claiming they have no responsibility for them. It is a fig leaf of justification and it can\u2019t go on.\u201d Ashok Kumar, a lecturer in political economy at Birkbeck, said other colleges within UoL had brought maintenance staff in-house and that \u201cincreasingly militaristic\u201d tactics were being employed, such as the use of private security to evict student occupiers without an injunction. \u201cIt\u2019s fairly unprecedented,\u201d he said. Last month, the University and College Union voted to boycott Senate House, the administrative centre of UoL, because of its treatment of cleaning, catering and security staff and others not directly employed by the university. UoL was contacted for comment. After publication, a spokesperson said: \u201cThe university firmly rejects allegations of a violent removal of a small group of students who occupied a room in Senate House last week. \u201cThe students were removed without any violence or harm as they were potentially endangering themselves by sitting on exterior balconies, blocking fire exits and smoking on university premises. They had blocked all exits to the Chancellor\u2019s Hall, ignored a genuine fire alarm and were in breach of our visitor regulations. \u201cThe university was in very regular contact with the student group throughout the occupation. The students were offered a meeting with the vice-chancellor to discuss their demands but did not take up this opportunity.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
