Saad Hariri, who leads the ruling party alliance, has lived abroad in fear of his life since a wave of political assassinations blamed on the Syrian regime. He said tomorrow's rally should be a sign of \"national unity\" and repeated his calls for the resignation of Lebanon's pro-Syrian president, Emile Lahoud. Lebanon has been through a dramatic upheaval in the year since February 14, when Hariri and 20 others were killed in a car bomb in Beirut. His death triggered a popular uprising that unseated the government and eventually forced Syria to withdraw its troops from Lebanon after 29 years. A few weeks later an anti-Syrian alliance led by Mr Hariri won the largest number of seats in the general election. An ongoing UN investigation into the assassination has already put four Lebanese security chiefs in jail and a number of senior Syrian officials are also listed as suspects. But despite these advances, the country still struggles to reconcile its sensitive sectarian differences, which have been worsened by the assassinations and bombings of the past year. \"The Lebanese have achieved their freedom and sovereignty,\" Mr Hariri said yesterday. \"Now we're trying to preserve this freedom and this sovereignty. We have a lot of challenges because there is a lot of interference in Lebanese politics. Now we are trying to build a nation.\" Jihad Zein, of the An Nahar newspaper, said the past year had brought tremendous change. \"It is an historic achievement,\" he said. \"But unfortunately we are not taking this historic opportunity to rebuild our country.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
