Those images may have once been intended to portray a strong White House, impervious to the virus \u2013 we have always known that the president has a keen eye for optics, after all (remember that doctored photo from his inauguration?). But now the president has been diagnosed with Covid-19, and as we learn just how far his team may have spread the virus, these photos betray a different image: of Donald Trump the super-spreader; of all the moments his team potentially put others in acute danger. Here are those moments, in pictures. Supreme court nomination at the White House Rose Garden On 26 September, five days before the resident was diagnosed with the coronavirus, Trump held an event to announce his nomination for Judge Amy Coney Barrett, to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s spot on the supreme court. The ceremony is now thought to have been a super-spreader event, with 200 people in attendance, at least eight of whom have now tested positive for the virus. Here, the former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who has now tested positive for Covid-19, hugs a guest close, while neither of them wear masks. People were packed in tightly, sitting shoulder to shoulder. Later the reception continued inside the White House. In this photo, Melania, Senator Thom Thillis of North Carolina and President Trump \u2013 who would later test positive for the virus \u2013 all mingle without masks. Pennsylvania rally As if one event wasn\u2019t enough that day, Trump and his colleagues later attended a Make America Great Again campaign rally in Middletown, Pennsylvania. His political counsel Hope Hicks was in attendance at the rally, cheering without a mask on. Four days later, Hicks began showing symptoms of the virus and went into self-isolation. Supporters showed their love for the president at the rally, with fists in the air and very few masks to be seen. Remembrance candle lighting inside the White House The next day, Trump attended a candle lighting inside the White House East Room with families of those who died during service. People sat knee-to-knee, many of them elderly, with not one mask visible in the crowd. The presidential debates On Tuesday, before the presidential debates, Trump, Christie and lawyer Rudy Giuliani sit inside without masks during a news conference. Here, two photos show Melania wearing a mask in one instant and in the next without it. The family reportedly waved away masks when offered to them that night. \u201cWhen needed, I wear masks,\u201d Trump later said in the debate. Two days later, he tested positive for the virus. Another rally in Minnesota On Wednesday, the president went to Minnesota for a fundraiser alongside his aide Hope Hicks \u2013 who later began feeling unwell and reportedly had to self-isolate on the plane ride back. And social distancing wasn\u2019t exactly commonplace in the crowd. Hicks tested positive for the virus the following morning. Later that night, Trump would announce (erroneously) that the \u201cend of the pandemic is in sight\u201d. The walk of shame Here, Trump heads towards the White House on Thursday evening after his positive test, looking a little worse for wear. Ever aware of optics, Trump flew to hospital on Friday, but made sure he was photographed walking to the helicopter by himself. This was reportedly an attempt to escape another unsavory image, of having to be assisted out of the White House if he got sicker. A drive-by greeting But he couldn\u2019t stay away from the crowds for long. On Sunday, Trump jumped into his armoured SUV for a drive-by greeting with supporters. Here, they wave him on. \u201cEvery single person in the vehicle during that completely unnecessary Presidential \u2018drive-by\u2019 just now has to be quarantined for 14 days,\u201d tweeted James Phillips, an attendant physician at Walter Reed, where Trump is being treated. \u201cThey might get sick. They may die. For political theater. Commanded by Trump to put their lives at risk for theater. This is insanity.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
