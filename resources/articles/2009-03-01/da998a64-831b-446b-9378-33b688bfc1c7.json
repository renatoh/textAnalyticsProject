The Italian made the decision after Carlton Cole was ruled out with a thigh injury picked up in this evening's 4-0 win over Slovakia. Capello also has a major doubt over Emile Heskey, who will undergo a scan tomorrow after lasting just 14 minutes before limping off with what the England coach described as cramp. Capello previously ruled out the possibility of drafting in Michael Owen. Bent won the last of his four caps in November, when he was part of the team that registered an historic win over Germany in Berlin. Previously, the 24-year-old was a substitute when England suffered their catastrophic home defeat to Croatia that cost them a place at Euro 2008. With Owen and Kevin Davies ruled out as potential replacements for Cole, the only other possibility was Gabriel Agbonlahor, but he pulled out of the Under-21 defeat in Norway last night with a hamstring strain. Capello will wait for the results of the scan on Heskey, who prodded England in front after just eight minutes to break an international scoring drought that dates back almost six years, before deciding whether he needs further reinforcements. \"Michael Owen played 20 minutes in his last game, it is not enough,\" declared Capello. \"And it would not be Kevin Davies either.\" With the uncertainty surrounding his strikeforce, Capello was enthusiastic about Wayne Rooney performance, the Manchester United striker scoring two second-half goals to seal a well deserved man-of-the-match award. \"I am very happy for him,\" he said. \"He played very well, scored two goals and is a very important player for us. His movement with Steven Gerrard was very good, both when we were attacking and defending and I was delighted.\" Although he is loathe to use him in such a role, Capello has not entirely dismissed the thought of playing Rooney as the main striker in midweek. \"Rooney can play anywhere,\" said the Italian. \"If our team were a pack of cards, he would be our joker.\" Capello also offered Aaron Lennon a decent pat on the back after an encouraging first-half display from the Tottenham man. Lennon's departure heralded the entrance of David Beckham for his record 109th cap, with the signs that he will earn many more after he supplied the pinpoint cross for Rooney's first after earlier setting up Crouch. Crouch's header would have brought a goal had an offside John Terry not needlessly prodded the ball over the line. \"David played like I know David can,\" said Capello. \"It was a good cross for Wayne's goal. His movement was good and he held the ball really well.\" With Frank Lampard adding a third before Rooney's chip completed the scoring in stoppage time, injuries not withstanding Capello can look forward to the Ukraine encounter with confidence, although he accepts the win that would put England well on the way to South Africa 2010 is not a foregone conclusion. \"Ukraine are a good team,\" he said. \"When they drew against Croatia they defended very well. It will not be any easier for us.\" Wayne Rooney admitted the injuries to his fellow strikers removed some of the sheen from England's comfortable win. \"We played very well today,\" he said. \"The first half hour was excellent, and we should have scored a few more goals. Overall, it was a good performance and a well-deserved win. It's a bit sad we got the injuries early on, but it was a good build-up for us. I'm delighted I'm scoring goals for England, the team is working really hard in training - and the set-up seems to suit me very well.\" There was also praise from Vladimir Weiss, whose side were supposed to supply a tough test having risen to the top of Group Three before they were usurped by Northern Ireland's fine win over Poland today. \"The English team is one of the best in the world,\" he said. \"I could not understand why they failed to reach Euro 2008. \"Fabio Capello has made them much braver. They are disciplined and full of energy. \"They have some fantastic players and gave us a slap behind the ear, which, bearing in mind we must face the Czech Republic on Wednesday, we probably needed.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
