But you can sign up to our mailing list to be the first to hear when we announce new classes. Most of us are guilty of being harder on ourselves than we are on others \u2013 and in a crisis, this self-critical talk can multiply. It is too easy to compare our productivity levels and lifestyle choices to those of others, particularly when we now have more time for social media than ever before. The uncertainty, rapid change and isolation we experience are fertile ground for our anxieties. So how can you stay focused on fulfilling your potential and break the cycle of self-doubt? Is it possible to grow with purpose rather than merely surviving? How can you recognise and tackle stress as and when it arises while isolated at home? In this evening masterclass with leading life coach Fiona Buckland, you will learn the practical techniques for improving your confidence, effectiveness and positive sense of self \u2013 no matter the challenges you are confronted with. You will come away with a newfound confidence in your abilities to reduce the power of your inner critic, and this is an essential class for anyone with a desire to connect with those critical inner resources that energise you into action, even in difficult times. Please note that this course will be hosted online. Places are extremely limited and will be allocated on a first come, first served basis.
