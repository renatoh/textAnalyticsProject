Blackburn have the pick of five strikers and they possess arguably the best midfield in the division but still they could not score. However, they are currently enjoying a 12-match unbeaten run and are sure to be major contenders in this season's promotion race. But Souness knows his team may need more cunning to fulfil their dreams of a Premiership return. And Berkovic could be just the man to provide it. Souness and the Barnsley manager Nigel Spackman are graduates of the Anfield academy and it showed in the way they approached a contest between teams separated by 25 points in the table but sharing the same willingness to play the Liverpool way. Barnsley, in the first half, produced the sort of football more suited to success than survival. But in the final 30 minutes Blackburn had enough chances to win the game as Matt Jansen, David Dunn and Marcus Bent all hit the woodwork. Afterwards Jansen said: \"On another day I could have had a hat-trick. It is very disappointing.\" Resolute defending, off-key finishing and sheer bad luck left the home side lamenting the loss of valuable points against a side that had lost their previous five matches. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
