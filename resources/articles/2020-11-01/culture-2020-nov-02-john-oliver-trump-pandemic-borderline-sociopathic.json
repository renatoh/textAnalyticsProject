With just two days before the US presidential election, \u201cI would love nothing more than to not talk about Covid and instead return to subjects we\u2019d normally cover on this show,\u201d said John Oliver on Sunday night, \u201cbut unfortunately I can\u2019t do that when so many Americans are still dying of Covid every day.\u201d Despite a third surge of US coronavirus cases this month and a response that ineffectively lagged behind other countries \u2013 the US has 4% of the world\u2019s population, but 20% of its Covid cases \u2013 many Americans still believe that Trump has handled the pandemic well. Or, as several Ohio voters put it to reporters, Trump is \u201cdoing the best he can\u201d. \u201cDo you mean that he\u2019s doing the best that any president can, or the best that he can?\u201d Oliver wondered. \u201cBecause if it\u2019s the second one, you may actually be right. We should probably all be grateful that he hasn\u2019t started bottling his urine and selling it as Trump Immunity Juice.\u201d The coronavirus pandemic is Trump\u2019s defining presidential crisis, Oliver continued. \u201cBut his response has been such a disaster that there are massive fuck-ups you may have already forgotten,\u201d such as the time Trump suggested American passengers should stay on the Covid-addled Diamond Princess cruise ship to keep down the official US case numbers. But Oliver identified three categories of egregious Trump pandemic mismanagement: preparation, coordination and communication. Previous administrations had braced for a potential viral pandemic: George W Bush demanded a pandemic response plan in 2005, while Obama created a pandemic preparedness team. Trump, in contrast, acted \u201cunforgivably slowly\u201d once the US knew about the disease in China; the first case of coronavirus was reported in the Chinese province of Wuhan on 31 December 2019, but the health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, couldn\u2019t schedule a meeting with Trump until 18 January. It wasn\u2019t until 2 February, two weeks after the first confirmed Covid case in the US, that Trump imposed a leaky travel ban on China that exempted another 40,000 US citizens, residents and family members. It took another six weeks for Trump to announce a haphazard set of travel bans on Europe, where most of New York\u2019s Covid cases actually originated. All the while, Trump did not take calls for ramping up production of personal protective equipment (PPE) seriously; Oliver returned to a clip from the White House in which Sophia Thomas, president of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, told Trump that PPE had been sporadic. Trump interrupted \u201csporadic for you but not sporadic for a lot of other people \u2026 initially we had nothing, we had empty cupboards\u201d left by the Obama administration. \u201cFirst, \u2018sporadic for you, not sporadic for other people\u2019 is the literal definition of sporadic,\u201d Oliver retorted, \u201cand second, his complaint that he had empty cupboards and shelves is slightly undercut by the fact that he\u2019d been president for slightly more than three years when that conversation took place. If you move into an apartment and three years later there is still nothing in the cupboards, you don\u2019t get to blame the previous tenant when you\u2019re hungry. Go buy some fucking food.\u201d Trump also \u201crepeatedly undermined public health messaging from the very start\u201d, Oliver said, \u201cdespite the fact that, as we now know, he knew extremely early on just how bad things could get\u201d. In an interview for the book Rage, Trump privately told journalist Bob Woodward on 7 February that he understood the coronavirus to be much deadlier than the seasonal flu. Later that month, in public, he downplayed the severity of Covid as just \u201clike a flu\u201d. \u201cYeah, Trump just lied,\u201d said Oliver, \u201cwhich I know at this point isn\u2019t something that I should have to say; it seems like the kinda thing we all already know, like \u2018puppies are good.\u2019\u201d Still, it\u2019s worth remembering that Trump\u2019s leadership during the pandemic has been \u201cborderline sociopathic\u201d, said Oliver, \u201cbecause just think of what medical professionals have had to go through this year\u201d. In the height of New York\u2019s crisis, refrigerated trucks served as morgues, while numerous health workers tearfully pleaded on social media for help with supplies and burnout. In another clip, Ernest J Grant, president of the American Nurses Association, voiced concern about PTSD within hospital staff ranks in the Oval Office, before Trump cut him off to hand out souvenir pens. \u201cLook, if Biden is elected, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to magically end this pandemic, but he\u2019ll at least take it seriously,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s pretty bleak that that alone sounds good, but it really does. Because at this point, Trump is clearly bored of hearing about Covid, and I am sorry about that, but you know what\u2019s been completely exhausting for the rest of us? Worrying about it all the time.\u201d That worrying continues, as several southern and midwestern states set single-day records last week. \u201cThis virus has taken so much from us: our peace of mind, our routines, and nearly a quarter of a million Americans,\u201d Oliver concluded. \u201cAnd it\u2019s frankly pathetic that in response, the only thing Trump has offered people in this country over the past eight months are damaging lies, staggering incompetence, and occasionally, when he\u2019s feeling generous, some shitty fucking pens.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
