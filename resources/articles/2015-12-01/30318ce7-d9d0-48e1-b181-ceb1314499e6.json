The flowers, more usually associated with Easter than Christmas, have been seen around the country in a week when daytime temperatures were as much as 10C above the seasonal average. Greg Dewhurst, a forecaster from the Met Office, said: \u201cThe weather pattern has brought low pressure after low pressure, with mild conditions from the south. We would normally expect a variation in the wind direction at this time of year, with wind from the north bringing high pressure and leading to overnight frosts and fog. But because it has been so mild, windy and cloudy it has not allowed for colder weather to settle in.\u201d Guy Barter, the chief horticultural adviser at the Royal Horticultural Society, told the Telegraph that it was the earliest he can recall seeing daffodils in bloom. \u201cI have always scoffed at the idea of flowers before Christmas but I will have to eat my words,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in unknown territory in many ways. What consequence it will have, we don\u2019t know.\u201d He explained: \u201cDaffodils have a mechanism to sense temperature and after a defined period of cold (generally about 2-10C) they are triggered to flower, and they will then flower according to ambient temperature.\u201d Bookmakers have shortened the odds on Christmas being the warmest in history in the light of recent forecasts. Coral has slashed the odds from 5/1 to 2/1 on over the past 24 hours, and also believe the chance of a white Christmas is now a long shot. Spokesman John Hill said: \u201cWe have pushed the odds out to evens from 1/2 in light of the recent forecasts. However, we will be sweating on Christmas Day because if there is now snow in the UK, we will be forced to pay out our biggest liability to date on a white Christmas.\u201d Helen Rossington, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, said: \u201cYesterday we got up to 14C or 15C across the south-west, but today just about everywhere is in double figures. In south-east England, East Anglia and the London area highs are going to be around 16C. The average is around 9C at this time of year for that part of England.\u201d The hottest 16 December in the UK was recorded in 1972 at Aber in Gwynedd, north-west Wales, when it reached 17C, and Rossington suggested that the records for December 17 and 18, at 17.8C and 18C respectively, could be under threat. Rossington said: \u201cAt this stage I would say it is fairly unlikely. There is a chance that maybe Scotland might get some colder air, and a slight chance in the north they might get some snow, but in the south it is more likely to be unsettled. But it is very early days yet.\u201d Wirral Bird Club posted a photograph of daffodils flowering in Chester on Twitter, saying: \u201cThe weather has gone mad,\u201d while another user showed a picture of daffodils in full bloom in Downpatrick, County Down. Another Twitter user posted a photograph of a field of daffodils in London\u2019s Olympic Park, with the hashtag #climatechange. Even in Cumbria, which suffered the brunt of recent flooding, daffodils have been spotted, with Kendal Gardening tweeting: \u201cAfter floods have come the Daffodils! In the Lyth Valley in mid December! Madness!\u201d However, a dust cloud from the Sahara is expected to settle over parts of the UK on Thursday, prompting health experts to issue warnings to the elderly and those who suffer from breathing problems. High levels of pollution are expected over southern and central England, with Lincolnshire worst affected. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has issued alerts for most of England and Wales, warning that the elderly, asthma sufferers and those with breathing difficulties are most at risk. Defra said: \u201cAdults and children with lung problems, and adults with heart problems, should reduce strenuous physical exertion, particularly outdoors, and particularly if they experience symptoms. People with asthma may find they need to use their reliever inhaler more often. Older people should also reduce physical exertion.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
