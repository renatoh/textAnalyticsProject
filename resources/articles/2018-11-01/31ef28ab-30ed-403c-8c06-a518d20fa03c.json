Details of the payment to Sir Greg Martin, the former head of the Durand Academy in Stockwell, south London, emerged on Monday during a hearing of the Commons public accounts committee, which is investigating academy accounts and performance. It is the latest development in a long-running saga involving Martin, who was knighted for services to education and was once a favourite of Tory ministers, before falling out of favour as concerns grew about financial management and governance at the school. Durand Academy has since been transferred to a new sponsor and has been renamed the Van Gogh primary school, but the Durand Education Trust (DET) retained ownership of the private leisure centre developed on the site, as well as two accommodation blocks, which originally generated additional income for the school. John Wentworth, a DET trustee, told MPs the assets \u2013 the leisure centre and accommodation \u2013 were still generating \u00a3400,000 a year but \u201cmost\u201d of the money was going towards Martin\u2019s severance pay rather than going towards\u2019 children\u2019s education. \u201cAt the moment, we have a considerable liability to the previous executive headteacher of Durand Academy,\u201d Wentworth told MPs, adding that the severance figure had been \u201cconsiderably higher\u201d but had been reduced after negotiations between Martin and the Charity Commission. Wentworth told MPs there were ongoing discussions between the DET and the Education and Skills Funding Agency about what would happen to the leisure centre and accommodation blocks. He said if the DET retained control they would be used in line with its charitable objectives \u201cto support the wider education objectives of children in Lambeth and to support the children at the Van Gogh primary school\u201d. The hearing offered some fascinating insights into the complexities of transferring schools from one trust to another. The Dunraven Educational Trust, which finally took over Durand, was given just 48 hours to make a decision after the Harris Federation pulled out, though Harris helpfully shared all the information gathered during its investigations. Nevertheless, committee chair Meg Hillier described it as \u201ca 48-hour fire sale\u201d. The hearing was also told about troubles at Bright Tribe, which ran 10 schools in the north and east of England which are now being rebrokered. The academies troubleshooter, Angela Barry, who was brought as interim chief executive, refused to give details about ongoing investigations but apologised for past failings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
