I had a similar experience earlier this year, getting off the King\u2019s Lynn train at Cambridge and leaving my Northumbrian small pipes behind. I despaired, having experienced the deficiencies of the giant lost property office at the Thameslink station. However, I received a phone call from Mandy at King\u2019s Lynn station, who had found the pipes and noticed my mobile number on the case. It seems she maintains a kind of lost property cupboard, out of commitment to an ethos of customer service that I had assumed was all but lost. Better still, she gave the pipes to Tom, her train driver friend, who brought them back to Cambridge on the next train. I met him on platform 7, exchanged my pipes for a bottle of champagne for Mandy, and played him a tune, which he appreciated: he turned out by an extraordinary coincidence to be the nephew of a Northumbrian piper from Newcastle. Both stories are testaments to human decency, as well as timely warnings to absent-minded musicians. Prof Andrew Burn Cambridge"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
