When he's done that, we have to hope he runs a different kind of administration from the one we've lived under so far. The Hammond inquiry is only the most recent piece of evidence that he needs to. What his government lacks is specific gravity. It's the most disturbing of its weaknesses. In the least vulnerable government for 20 years, it is a perverse omission. The second term should start by recognising that the commodity Mr Blair most needs is ballast that measures up to his power. The evidence of the coming victory isn't only in the opinion polls. We see it more tellingly in the ease with which scandal, or the rumour of scandal, is reduced to hoo-hah. Sir Anthony Hammond may have decided that every minister touched by the Hinduja imbroglio deserved the benefit of the doubt. But the British people got there before him. That's the way it almost always is with intimations of impropriety. A government needs to be already rotten, or palpably at the end of its natural life, for such stories to disturb popular acquiescence in the belief that most politicians are pretty dodgy anyway. It is doubtful whether Profumo could have unhinged Macmillan, or Aitken helped destroy John Major, had the revelations occurred when these leaders were in their prime. Labour is fortunate to be so untouchable. Hammond's forensics, although benign, still reveal a shocking mess. In a different national mood, they would have produced a conviction not an acquittal. Especially fortunate is Jack Straw, who not only mis-assessed the available evidence before he called one of his colleagues a liar, but urged his own officials to work \"helpfully\" on the passport request from Prakash Hinduja, and then deployed a fake grammarian's casuistry to pretend that this didn't mean his officials were meant to be helpful. Peter Mandelson's own lack of transparency would also have counted against him rather than, conveniently, in his favour. But not a blow was struck. We shrug our shoulders. Not even the Tory press can gain much traction when their own man is plainly on the floor. Only when there's a chance of drawing blood does the pack seriously show its teeth. There have been several mini-scandals and mendacities involving Labour politicians, often aggravated by the brazen willingness of the Commons Labour-run standards committee to override the ethical adjudications of the parliamentary commissioner, Elizabeth Filkin, with their own partisanship: or, as has now happened with Keith Vaz, to allow an MP's persistent obstruction of her inquiry to justify a verdict of innocence, however unconvincing. Such episodes count for nothing. The time is not ripe. Tory attempts to keep new scandal going until election day, putting Robin Cook or Wafic Said in the dock, seem desperate measures. When a huge majority is expected to remain impregnable for an other five years, some of the life goes out of the normal rules of accountability. This systemic frailty, however, is paralleled by a worse one. While sheltering behind its unchallengeable strength, the government acts at other times from weakness. It is intensely neurotic. It has not used the institutions at its disposal in ways that befit its power. Instead it has marginalised them, as if in terror of anything that does not emanate from the tiny power-centre, 10 Downing Street, where all must be decided. It lacks, in short, ballast. The most obviously sidelined body is the House of Commons. A deep paradox is at work there. The size of the majority turns out to be in inverse ratio to the scale of creative relevance which is permitted to it. The parliamentary majority matters less than the media minority. The majority is seldom consulted. Instead of deploying it to overwhelm the transient passions of the press, Blairism has all too often allowed the media to dictate the final shaping of its legislative programme. There have been times when no difference was discernible between the dithering uncertainty of this government with a majority of 179, and its predecessor whose leader often had to spend the day calculating whether he would survive the vote at 10 o'clock that night. A similar distrust for the old pillars is to be found in New Labour's attitude to the civil service, and to Whitehall's more valuable mores. The Mandelson/Hinduja affair offers a good example. A month ago, I wrote disparagingly about the role in this of Sir Richard Wilson, the cabinet secretary. I owe him an apology. I knew he had been present at the impromptu court that decided Mandelson should go, but not that his own advice, as we learn from Hammond, said there wasn't \"a shred of evidence that anything improper took place\". Sir Richard wasn't a spineless accomplice, as I implied. On the other hand, he was impotent. He was cited to me as sealing, with Lord Irvine, Mandelson's fate, when in fact, apart from asking the prime minister whether he still had confidence in the minister, he didn't. If anything, he went the other way, urging Mr Blair to deflect the issue from himself. But Downing Street couldn't let that happen. The weight of the cabinet secretary's word isn't what it used to be. Blair had no time for the rules of natural justice, nor for the patience that some were counselling. He took a decision that was the acme of what's most oddly wrong with this mighty administration: panic-stricken, overwrought, hysterical about the next election. There are other symptoms of the kind of weakness New Labour is prone to. This could be called corruption. But it is not personal corruption. There's been quite a catalogue of charges of impropriety, shading the edges of old-fashioned standards but not descending into personal venality. These men aren't on the take for themselves, though they may be for their party. More to the point is this Labour government's capacity for institutional seduction by rich men, its mesmerisation with the wealth and power of people whom all Mr Blair's predecessors as party leader, with the partial exception of Harold Wilson, regarded in essence as their enemies. The corruption is institutional. It's a corruption of outlook more than conduct, and was born of insecurity. Apart from the attraction of the rich as party donors, there was the guarantee they could offer that Labour is no longer just a party of the poor and underprivileged but one with credibility at all levels of society. Even for a prime minister, it seems, sitting down with the Hindujas shored up his status as the friend of every mover and shaker in the land. In the second term, there will be no dome, one assurance of better times ahead. No more supplication at the trough where public folly fed off private wealth. But Labour needs a new equilibrium. After a second victory it must no longer fawn or truckle. Its arrogance will need constant watching. But let's hope it also stops, at last, behaving as if its nervous-system will implode at any moment. hugoyoung@compuserve.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
