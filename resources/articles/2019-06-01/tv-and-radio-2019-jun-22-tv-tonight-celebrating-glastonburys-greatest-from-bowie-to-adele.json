Plus, interviews with Damon Albarn, Liam Gallagher and the Chemical Brothers. None of whom have ever shimmied round the stage like a slinky while honking the theme from The Benny Hill Show into a rhinestone-studded saxophone. Only Dolly Parton did that. So she wins. Ali Catterall BBC Cardiff Singer of the World Final 7.30pm, BBC Four Which of the finalists will walk away with the title of BBC Cardiff Singer of the World and a prize of \u00a320,000?

In any case, episode three may prove a turning point for viewers and critics alike, with Eve and Villanelle in deliciously close proximity. Hannah J Davies Piers Morgan\u2019s Life Stories 9.35pm, ITV Real-life mates Morgan and Alan Sugar have done well out of their pantomime feud. You might consider this bonhomie-filled chat \u2013 the last in the current series \u2013 to be a curtain call. Certainly don\u2019t expect any tough questions to interrupt Lord Sugar\u2019s flow, as he reminiscences on Amstrad, Spurs and Trump. Ellen E Jones 1919-39: A Mere Truce? 10.10pm, France 24 A timely film from the English-language arm of the French news channel examines the legacy of the Paris peace conference of 1919, which led to the controversial treaty of Versailles.
