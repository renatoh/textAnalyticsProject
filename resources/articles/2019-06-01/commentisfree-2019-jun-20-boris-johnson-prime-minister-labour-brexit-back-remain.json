Is Labour ready to take him on?", "bodyText": "The nation watches this strange array of men deranged enough to aspire to run a country in an insoluble crisis of their own making. As a despairing and departing chancellor spells out today at Mansion House, they all lie through their teeth: there will be no new EU deal, they will be stopped from leaving with no deal, they will not keep their wild tax-cutting promises \u2013 and they know it. Yesterday they ejected the only one who tiptoed closer to these truths, but Rory Stewart also swore blind he would Brexit, come what may. We watch aghast at the grisly choice, outraged again at being excluded from electing our own prime minister. Our fate is left to a rabble of extreme rightwing revolutionary Tory members who will tear up everything in pursuit of an abstract ideological phantasm. They may look like deceptively normal Rotarians and golf-club members, pillars of their communities, but YouGov finds them eager to wreck the union: 63% glad to see Scotland go, 59% waving goodbye to Northern Ireland in order to see Brexit take place. But most astoundingly, nearly two-thirds of this erstwhile \u201cnatural party of government\u201d are quite sanguine if their Brexit does \u201csignificant damage to the UK economy\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell feature strongly in these Tory debates as mortal hazards facing the nation \u2013 looming Marxists ready to turn us into Venezuela. But in this world turned upside down, nothing ever proposed, planned, desired or dreamed by Labour\u2019s left, nothing in its natonalising manifesto, ever matched these Tory Maoists-on-speed\u2019s willingness to wreak \u201csignificant damage\u201d on us all. There never was a more open goal for Labour, as day after day the effects of a decade of malevolent maladministration tumble out. On Wednesday, on just one ordinary news day, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported UK teachers have the heaviest workloads, bar Japan. The head of NHS England found the 10% cut in hospital beds has been too many (who knew?). The number of rough sleepers in London reached a record high. The Resolution Foundation found 18- to 29-year-olds\u2019 spending money has fallen 7% since 2001 while the over-65s\u2019 has risen 37% over the same period. Labour should be stratospherically ahead in the polls. Instead, its 14% showing in the EU elections, behind the Lib Dems and only just beating the Greens, shows Brexit blows away everything else, trumping old party loyalties. Pointing to austerity\u2019s devastations doesn\u2019t summon back those lost Labour votes. Fence-sitting has been calamitous: YouGov shows Labour has lost half its 2017 general election votes \u2013 a third to remain parties and 11% to Brexit parties. As the YouGov founder Peter Kellner points out, an average of the last year\u2019s polls shows a national swing \u2013 with 44% backing leave and 56% remain. This is partly demographic (older, mainly leave, voters are dying while pro-remain teenagers reach voting age) but crucially the swing to remain is bolstered by Labour voters in the north and Midlands changing their minds. The shadow cabinet meeting on Wednesday responded slower than a slug, while Labour members agitate frantically for a rapid response U-turn. A report presented, purporting to show backing remain would lose more seats than fence-straddling, has been forensically dismantled by Kellner and by the psephologist Lewis Baston. In virtually all leave constituencies, most Labour supporters voted remain: non-Labour supporters created leave majorities. Those at the meeting say the report cut no ice \u2013 and there was marked shift in attitudes: only Ian Lavery, the party chair who ignores party members, and Jon Trickett stayed adamant Brexiters with a new softening of opposition from the likes of Richard Burgon and Andrew Gwynne. The rest moved with Corbyn\u2019s confirmed position, to support a referendum. But that\u2019s only halfway. At next Tuesday\u2019s meeting, they will have to move to backing remain. Nothing else will do. Said one, \u201cHow do you back a referendum but when asked what Labour supports, reply \u2018We don\u2019t know\u2019. Ridiculous!\u201d Despite references to Harold Wilson in 1975 letting his divided party take opposite sides, that can\u2019t and won\u2019t happen this time. (Though Brexiters may be recused in a campaign.) The party is not deeply divided, but very strongly remain in parliament and constituencies. Powerful voices \u2013 Keir Starmer, Tom Watson, Emily Thornberry, Diane Abbott, Andy McDonald and more \u2013 show why remain is the only credible Labour policy. Despite 26 of Labour\u2019s MPs writing a letter pleading against a referendum and remain, here\u2019s the question for them: will they really vote for any Boris Johnson deal (possibly a joint Nigel Farage/Johnson deal), and trust this most treacherous man with the crucial next stage of EU negotiations? To back it will be to sabotage the Northern Ireland border and the Good Friday agreement. Surely, come that day, they won\u2019t, they can\u2019t. Optimists in the shadow cabinet hope that as soon as next Tuesday Jeremy Corbyn will shift to remain. But will he sell it, argue for it, make the pro-European case, or skirt around it again, leaving it to half a mumbled phrase tucked into speeches on austerity? Rachael Maskell, a strong Corbyn-supporting MP, but co-founder of Love Socialism Hate Brexit, talks to him often. She has urged Corbyn \u201cto lead the charge. He\u2019s a visionary, but he\u2019s being choked off by the push-and-pull and by his inner office. We should be leading a big, bold reform in Europe, on climate, on globalisation, not a little England at the mercy of a Trump trade deal.\u201d Maskell wants those in leave seats to campaign as she did nonstop in her poorest working-class estates, successfully swinging them with proof that Brexit would be terrible for them. The time is short. Johnson will likely be prime minister in a month, and by then Labour needs to be his most powerful, coherent, unequivocal opposition \u2013 or others will. Labour\u2019s flannelling half-assent to Brexit gives daily aid to enemies of everything Labour stands for. Every day that passes, the less forgiven Labour will ever be by those who have already deserted it and may never come back. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
