As one former employee, born in 1920, put it: \"You was overwhelmed at the roar of noise, and for about three days all you could hear was the roar in your ears. But after that you became part and parcel of it and you could talk quite normally. Although you didn't realise it, you were doing a lot of lip reading.\" One by one, the machines fell silent as the woollen worsted industry was undercut by cheap imports from a lot further east than Leeds, with some 45,000 people losing their jobs in the 1960s and 70s. The exodus continued apace in the 80s - a time when more than 200 former mill workers were given the chance, in the peace and quiet of their own homes, to talk about their work experiences. The late Olive Howarth, of the Bradford Heritage Recording Unit, transferred their memories from tape to printed page, and all 2,000 copies of Textile Voices: A Century of Mill Life sold out within 18 months. The book has now been updated and re-issued, with new interviews and more than 100 new photographs. The editor is Tim Smith, a freelance photographer whose own documentary work in what was left of the mills started in the mid-1980s. \"They were pictures of contemporary life when I took them,\" he says. \"Now they're part of history.\" Christopher Pratt's photographs belong to a more distant past. He used his camera as what Smith calls \"a campaigning tool\" to show conditions in the streets around the thriving mills of Edwardian Bradford. Another photographer is CH Wood, who bequeathed more than 200,000 glass negatives to Bradford Museums and Galleries. \"It's an amazing resource to tap into,\" says collections officer Michael Callaghan. Pratt and Wood would hardly recognise those dark, satanic mills today. Developers Urban Splash have transformed part of Lister's Manningham Mills, once the world's biggest silk factory, into 131 flats - still leaving space to accommodate a theatre company and the Manningham Mills Community Association. Members can talk without having to resort to lip reading. \u00b7 Textile Voices: A Century of Mill Life is published by the Bradford Heritage Recording Unit at \u00a312.95."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
