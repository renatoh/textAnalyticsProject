Now he has turned attention to an arena where the competition is as fierce but the issues more profound. American lawyer Clarence Darrow's reputation as World's Greatest Trial Lawyer (Cicero and Erskine only have claims to parity) rests on a trilogy of cases tried in the autumn of his career in the 1920s: the murder trial of Leopold and Loeb, who coldly killed for thrills a 14-year-old boy arbitrarily chosen from a cruising car; the Scopes monkey trial, in which a schoolmaster was accused of teaching evolution in fundamentalist Tennessee; and the Sweet trial, in which 11 black people were charged with murder after shots were fired by one of them and a white man was killed when a lynch mob tried to hound a black doctor and his pregnant wife out of an all-white neighbourhood in Detroit. It is a curious book because it reads like a novel in attributing acts, words and emotions to its characters. It seems the stuff of imagination rather than of record. It is only in the 40 pages of notes and sources at the end of the book that the reader can appreciate the depth of the author's research. Another oddity is the peculiar perspective that McRae has chosen. Prompted by his adventitious discovery of material about a revived romance with Darrow's sporadic lover, Mary Field Parton, who herself wished but never managed to write his biography, he describes the high point of Darrow's forensic career from her viewpoint. No advocate can flourish without cases worthy of their talent and Darrow rose to the occasions to capture his triple crown. Leopold and Loeb had no defence. Darrow's triumph was to save them from the death sentence (it was the noose and the electric chair which thrust advocates into the public limelight in a way which, certainly on this side of the Atlantic, has since been denied them). He persuaded the court to admit psychiatric evidence for the purposes of mitigation rather than support for a plea of insanity. In the Scopes trial, Darrow was pitted against the elderly William Jennings Bryan, three times unsuccessful candidate for the US presidency and, in his prime, a rhetorician as formidable as Darrow. Darrow exposed the inconsistencies in a literalist interpretation of the book of Genesis by calling Bryan into the witness box. This tactic was as successful as TH Huxley's defence of Darwin in his famous debate with Archbishop Wilberforce at Oxford in 1860, when he ended his speech with: \"I'd rather be the offspring of two apes than be a man and afraid to face the truth.\" In many ways, the last of three great trials, the defence of the Sweets and their friends, is the least known but most striking. Darrow had to persuade an all-white male jury of the innocence of his clients in the face of perjured police evidence. He did so by skilful cross-examination of the less prepared witnesses as well as a moving peroration which invited the jury to rise above parochial and temporary prejudice and to consider the perennial rights of man. All three cases were rooted in causes of the utmost significance \u2013 the death penalty, the tension between religion and reason and race discrimination. McRae quotes many of the finest passages in Darrow's speeches. By modern standards, they were of excessive lengths but of a simple majesty. Darrow was a true master of advocacy and the golden age of English advocacy \u2013 the Edwardian era of FE Smith, Edward Carson and Rufus Isaacs \u2013 had already passed when he enjoyed his Indian summer. Darrow has been the subject of a number of biographies, of which this will certainly not be the last. For those who wish to understand the man (warts and all, for he was as faithless to his mistress as to his wife) and the arena in which he plied his profession, this book will provide a vivid introduction. \u2022 Michael Beloff is a Queen's counsel and former president of Trinity College, Oxford."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
