Billed as the Carters, the couple premiered Everything is Love through Tidal, the streaming service co-owned by Jay-Z. Its arrival was announced on stage at their On the Run II tour at the London Stadium in the UK on Saturday, where screens projected the message \u201calbum out now\u201d. The appearance of the nine-track album confirms the rumours that the Carters were pursuing a joint project. In November 2017, Jay-Z told the New York Times that he and Beyonc\u00e9 had started working on something as they produced their respective albums 4:44 and Lemonade. \u201cWe were using our art almost like a therapy session,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we started making music together.\u201d Jay-Z\u2019s 4:44 was widely interpreted as his response to Lemonade, in which Beyonc\u00e9 appeared to reference his marital infidelity. Everything is Love depicts the couple in a state of romantic happiness, but confirms that they almost split up. \u201cWe broke up and got back together,\u201d Jay-Z raps on Lovehappy. \u201cWe came and we conquered/ Now we\u2019re happy in love,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 adds. The Carters also released a video for Apeshit, directed by Ricky Saiz and shot at the Louvre in Paris in May. Everything is Love is not streaming on Spotify or Apple Music. Spotify does not offer any of Jay-Z\u2019s major albums, and offers Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s catalogue up to and including Lemonade, which was initially a Tidal exclusive. Beyonc\u00e9 makes reference to her relationship with streaming platforms on Nice from the new album: \u201cMy success can\u2019t be quantified/ If I gave two fucks \u2013 two fucks \u2013 about streaming numbers/ Would have put Lemonade up on Spotify.\u201d The album was initially expected to arrive around Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s headline performance at this year\u2019s Coachella festival in April. On Friday night, the couple dedicated a rendition of Forever Young, the Alphaville song sampled on Jay-Z\u2019s 2009 single Young Forever, to the friends and families of the victims of the Grenfell tower fire. Both Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z wore green heart pin badges in support of the Justice4Grenfell campaign. Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z married on 4 April 2008. The couple have three children: Blue Ivy, age six, and twins Sir and Rumi, one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
