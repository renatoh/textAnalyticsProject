You have to run a label, or present a radio programme, or make other kinds of music. The BBC jazz awards held last week were full of such people: Colin Towns, Humphrey Lyttelton, Courtney Pine, and of course Jools Holland, Rolf Harris of boogie-woogie. The likable Holland, with his Rhythm and Blues Orchestra, was the main draw for the packed-out Later Prom, which applied the principles behind his TV show: simple presentation, faith in the unifying spirit of the blues, and mutual respect between musicians of differing abilities and genres. The Prom was a clever bit of programming, with half an hour's music from each of the three bands led by Holland, Joseph (who presents shows on Radio 3), and Nitin Sawhney, and a jam near the end. It wasn't always easy to hear the nuances of Joseph's amplified trio, exploring a repertoire that included Prelude to a Kiss and Donna Lee as well as his own Candlelit Supper, Moonlight Affair. And despite much jumping and jiving from Holland's team, the Albert Hall was not the ideal joint for a Friday night fish-fry. Sawhney's crew made the best use of this difficult acoustic space with a sharp, clear mix. After the opening Prophecy, for acoustic guitar, tablas (Aref Durvesh) and vocals (Jayanta Bose), they added another guitar and drums, but didn't move into full-on fusion until the third song, where Sawhney moved from guitar to keyboards and Eric Appapoulay played bass. Rapper JC001 (aka Jonathan Pandy) and Bose launched into a fiery duet over Sawhney's repetitive vamp, and the audience, pleased that the Proms could incorporate Indo-jazz rap, applauded wildly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
