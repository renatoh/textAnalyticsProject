Overall, they offered a probing examination of the goodness and evil of humanity. As a mirror to the continuing abuse of human rights across the world, it was salutary and a corrective to any assumption that opera is an easy, undemanding form. Lester Lynch\u2019s portrayal of Dallapiccola\u2019s unnamed prisoner, deceived into hoping for freedom, was gripping. Sustained by faith and the cajoling endearment of Peter Hoare\u2019s jailer calling him Fratello (little brother), only with the jailer\u2019s reappearance as the Grand Inquisitor condemning him to death does the prisoner realise hope was the ultimate form of torture. While the archetypal lamenting mother, Sara Fulgoni \u2013 vividly reflecting extremes of anguish \u2013 was a presence almost throughout, the chorus sang offstage, unseen, rather than entwined in the action. Pountney\u2019s minimal approach created an atmosphere whose rising tension was deeply disquieting. In a different league from Heggie and Menotti, the psychological acuity of Dallapiccola\u2019s score and the beauty of his instrumentation \u2013 realised with great sensitivity by Lothar Koenigs and the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, onstage and to one side \u2013 made this an intense experience. Using the expanse of the Millennium Centre stage with one set for all these operas \u2013 a railed gallery sweeping across the back \u2013 Spanish jails of the 16th and 18th centuries were translated here to contemporary bleakness. Thus solitary confinement in the same central cage was also the fate of Beethoven\u2019s political prisoner, Florestan, the impassioned Gwyn Hughes Jones. Emma Bell was in radiant form as his wife Leonora who, disguised as Fidelio, saves him from execution. The WNO chorus and community chorus, combining gloriously in the jubilant finale, wore T-shirts emblazoned with letters that should have spelled out Freiheit \u2013 Freedom \u2013 but instead were jumbled. The point was clear: even in the 21st century, freedom cannot be taken as read."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
