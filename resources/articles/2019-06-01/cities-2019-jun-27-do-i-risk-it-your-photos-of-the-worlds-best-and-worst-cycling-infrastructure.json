Your photos of the world's best and worst cycling infrastructure", "bodyText": "Bike lanes blocked by bollards, potholes, contradictory signs and \u201cthe world\u2019s shortest bike lane\u201d: when we asked for examples of the best and worst cycle infrastructure in cities the submissions came in thick and fast. Readers around the world shared photos of bikes lanes that were impossibly narrow, that led nowhere or were blocked by parked cars, even police cars. On the upside there were also cycle networks and paths that were a joy for people on bikes. Here are some of the best (and worst). Cambridge: signed pothole This photo of a bike sign, and an arrow pointing at a pothole, was sent in by Brian Hart. \u201cTaken in Thoday Street Cambridge, part of the new Cambridge infrastructure.\u201d Cape Town: \u2018Even the police park on the bike lane\u2019 Jared took this picture in the city centre in Cape Town: \u201cThis green lane is one of the only bike lanes in Cape Town. It\u2019s a glorified parking and taxi overtaking lane. And even the police park on it.\u201d Berlin: \u2018More of this please\u2019 This photo of a new bike lane at Hasenheide, in Neuk\u00f6lln, Berlin, was sent in by a reader who said: \u201cBeautiful safe bike lane. More of that, please. Dankesch\u00f6n.\u201d Hong Kong: \u2018Contradictory signs\u2019 Is cycling allowed? This photo was sent in by James Tagg, who said: \u201cContradictory cycle path signs abound in Hong Kong ...\u201d Bucharest: A tree blocks a bike path A reader let us know about this bicycle lane in Bucharest where a huge tree blocks the entire path. Seoul: \u2018One of the finest networks of long distance cycling routes\u2019 Brian Grover said: \u201cThis picture shows a repurposed highway bridge and a purpose-built bypass along a steeper section of the Nakdong River. It was taken on the Seoul to Busan mainline of the 4 Rivers Cycling network in South Korea. South Korea may have one of the finest networks of long distance cycling routes in the world.\u201d Bristol: \u2018It\u2019s incredibly dangerous\u2019 A reader sent in this photo of Jacob\u2019s Wells Road roundabout in Bristol, and said: \u201cThis short cycle lane goes nowhere! It sits between two lanes \u2013 look at the lines separating the lanes either side of it. Incredibly dangerous.\u201d London: \u2018Shameful\u2019 Michael, from London, said: \u201cThis is the shameful cycle lane on Parkway going into the Regent\u2019s Park at Gloucester Gate. My daughter, in the picture, is on her school journey.\u201d Leeds: \u2018The shortest bike lane ever?\u2019 Paul Bunton in Leeds said: \u201cA great local example in Leeds which is nine paces long. This was taken at the junction of King Lane and Nursery Lane in Leeds on 19 June. One of the shortest bike lanes I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d Dublin: \u2018It\u2019s not even possible to open the gate\u2019 Joan Sugrue in Dublin: \u201cThis is the cycle lane coming out from Deaf Village onto the Navan Road in Dublin. It is not even possible to open this gate as there are no movable hinges on it. It is a totally fixed structure.\u201d Bhubaneswar: Rubbish-strewn route This photo was taken in Bhubaneswar in eastern India where part of a street was recently painted for cycling but garbage has been dumped on it. Cardiff: \u2018A great cycling resource\u2019 Duncan in Cardiff says: \u201cCardiff barrage is a great cycling resource with virtually no cars bar a few dock workers. It is just a shame that Cardiff council obstructs or blocks cycling across it during the summer for events in the bay.\u201d Birmingham: \u2018A new cycle path\u2019 Tom from Birmingham said: \u201cA tasteful shade of blue tarmac marks the new cycle path down the central reservation in Bristol Road, three miles south of Birmingham city centre. It is part of a new cycle path from the city centre to Birmingham University and Selly Oak. The photo is looking north on the Bristol Road (A38) a short distance north of the intersection with Edgbaston Park Road. There were no cyclists in sight at this time, but already some cyclists are using it to commute and it will probably become much busier when the new academic year starts next September and hordes of students flood into this part of Birmingham.\u201d Edinburgh: \u2018Do I risk it?... Mmm, not today\u2019 Istvan sent in this photo taken in Queen Street, Edinburgh and says: \u201cDo I risk it? ... Mmm, not today ... Each traffic light on Queen Street has this very narrow bike lane to lead you to a bike zone in front of the traffic (usually used by cars, taxis and buses). There are many of these useless lanes everywhere in Edinburgh, and many many used for parking (when they don\u2019t have a double yellow line above the bicycle sign).\u201d Vienna: \u2018Many people use bikes\u2019 Laurence says: \u201cThis is just one of the ramps in Vienna, leading from the bridges over the Danube, to the bike track along each side of the river. There is a network of bike routes criss-crossing the city, with their own traffic lights at many junctions. Not surprisingly many people use bikes to get around the city.\u201d And here are a few that were shared on Twitter\u2026 Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
