Freestyle Cyclists, an organisation that opposes the mandatory wearing of bicycle helmets, has organised \u201chelmet optional\u201d group rides in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Wellington. The group\u2019s president, Alan Todd, said the safety benefits of helmets were outweighed by the effect they had on discouraging cycling. \u201cWe find that the mandatory helmet law is the single greatest barrier to the uptake of bicycle use in Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has created an image of cycling as a high-risk activity, and practically killed off the casual everyday use of the bike.\u201d He acknowledged helmets reduced the risk of injury during an accident, but said the introduction of helmet laws had not seen any drop in injury rates at a general population level. \u201cWe accept that a helmet might help in the event of an accident \u2026 [but] you must distinguish between crash data and population data. It hasn\u2019t had any measured safety benefit at the population level. Across population, the reduction in injuries was no more than the drop in cycling. \u201cIt beggars belief that in the 21st century we take something as benign and beneficial as bike riding and we punish people.\u201d It is an offence in every state and territory to cycle without a helmet. Laws were introduced in the early 1990s after a campaign from the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. In 1994 adults were granted an exception in the Northern Territory, but children are still required to wear helmets. Todd said he had organised a helmet-free ride in Melbourne last year without fines. A NSW police spokesman would not confirm attendees in Sydney would not be fined. Edward Hore, the president of the Australian Cycle Alliance, said he supported the protest. \u201cWe think helmets should be a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about banning helmets, we\u2019re talking about making them optional. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a peleton down a beach road, and you\u2019re not wearing a helmet, you\u2019re a bloody idiot, let\u2019s be frank. But we\u2019re talking about the rider in the park with a family, the local commuter, the gentle ride down the street. Once you\u2019ve measured your risk you can decide whether or not you want to don a helmet.\u201d Dr Andrea Christoff, a specialist in emergency care at the Children\u2019s hospital at Westmead, disagreed. She said Todd\u2019s focus on general population injury rates overlooked the safety benefits of helmets, especially for children. \u201cIf you look at injury rates per million in the population, you can\u2019t apply that to just one factor,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take all injuries. It\u2019s the percentage of all head injuries we need to look at. You need to look at the mechanism. People who have a head injury with a helmet and those who don\u2019t \u2013 those are the numbers.\u201d She said her experience of children\u2019s emergency care proved helmets were crucial, and she supported mandatory laws for both children and adults. \u201cI\u2019m an intensive care specialist and I\u2019ve seen the worst spectrum. I\u2019ve seen adults and children die after traumatic brain injuries. I never want to see that happen. \u201cThe impact of a head injury can be longstanding and result in significant brain injury and it can be life threatening. In paediatrics we know that helmets make a difference.\u201d Todd said that he expected children to be present at Saturday\u2019s protest rides, and it was up to parents whether they should wear helmets. \u201cWe expect parents will bring children on this ride. It\u2019s a protest ride and we are calling it helmet-optional. We are not giving instructions to parents about what they do with their children. He said Freecycle Australia was not pushing to repeal mandatory helmet laws for children \u201cat this stage\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t think the Australian public is ready for the conversation on children yet.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
