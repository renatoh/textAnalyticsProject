First up is the Premier League with coverage of Everton\u2019s first game after the sacking of Marco Silva, against Chelsea, kicking off at 12.30pm GMT. Our clockwatch follows covering the 3pm kick-offs, including Bournemouth v Liverpool and Tottenham v Burnley. Then it\u2019s off to the Etihad Stadium for the Manchester derby at 5.30pm. On Sunday, there\u2019s a top-of-the-table Women\u2019s Super League clash between Chelsea and Manchester City at noon. This is followed by the Premier League match between Aston Villa and Leicester at 2pm, then at 3pm the first Scottish domestic honour of the season is up for grabs when Rangers face Celtic in the Scottish League Cup final. Finally it\u2019s back to the Premier League, with coverage of Brighton v Wolves at 4.30pm. I\u2019ll leave you with our sports quiz of the week, plus best wishes and goodwill to all caretaker managers. Thanks for reading today. Bye! Gah. It was there. It was right there \u2026 Peter Oh emails: \u201cRe: Sofiane Boufal\u2019s stubbed toe among Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s woes. It\u2019s unfortunate that an incident with the bottom of a table has kept the Southampton attacker from helping his club move further away from the bottom of the table.\u201d Sunday sees the first Old Firm meeting in a Scottish League Cup final in eight years. And oh, the beef. This from PA Media: Rangers\u2019 captain James Tavernier lashed out at the former Celtic striker Chris Sutton, who called him a \u201cserial loser\u201d over his failure to win any major trophy since moving to Glasgow in 2015. Tavernier said: \u201cComments from pundits are irrelevant. I am here to do a job, I\u2019m here to win trophies. Previously we\u2019ve not done that but I fully believe in this squad and what we\u2019re capable of doing. We have to win games, we have to win trophies. All the boys who have signed here have come to win trophies. We\u2019re not here to be second best.\u201d Celtic\u2019s Neil Lennon believes there is a \u201cvery good chance\u201d that striker Odsonne Edouard will be fit after missing the past fortnight. Lennon said: \u201cThey all trained today. With Odsonne in particular it\u2019s a day-by-day thing so we\u2019ll see how he reacted to today\u2019s training tomorrow. He trained, did the full session today and looks like he\u2019s come through it no problem. I\u2019m always encouraged to see a player of that calibre on the training ground.\u201d Rangers\u2019 manager Steven Gerrard told left-back Borna Barisic to prove he his fit enough to claim a place in Rangers\u2019 lineup: \u201cBorna did a light session today. He did three-quarters of that. We\u2019re very hopeful. We\u2019ve still got to do one more session tomorrow so Borna and a few more who were carrying knocks from Aberdeen will be given as late as possible to give themselves the best chance to make themselves available.\u201d Garry Monk is waving two lighted sticks towards things on the Hillsborough pitch, aircraft marshal-style. Matters off the pitch are threatening to take the limelight, as PA Media report: Monk says Sheffield Wednesday must not be distracted by off-field issues before they host in-form Brentford tomorrow. The South Yorkshire club have denied all charges after the EFL opened after an investigation into the Owls\u2019 profitability and sustainability submission for 2017-18 concerning the sale of Hillsborough stadium. Wednesday, who begin the weekend two points off the play-off places, could face a hefty points deduction should they been found guilty. Monk said: \u201cOur job is to be focused on what we are doing here and that\u2019s the football. That\u2019s what we can control.\u201d Marco Silva has done the statement-through-the-League-Managers-Association thing: It has been a real honour to have managed Everton for the past 18 months and I would like to thank Farhad Moshiri, Bill Kenwright, Denise Barrett-Baxendale, Keith Harris, Marcel Brands and the entire board for giving me the opportunity to be part of this special club. Thank you to all of the Evertonian fans who always live and breathe the club and show such great passion. A special thank you to all of the players, for their professionalism and the commitment they put into their work every day and to the club staff who welcomed me to Finch Farm training ground and made me feel at home.\u201d Aww. The Fiver has landed. Check your inboxes. Or click below. Or sign up to save yourself having to come into one of these blogs looking for a link \u2026 Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl enters the weekend with his Southampton side out of the bottom three. He said: I knew what I would do when I was coming here, I knew that we have our limits and we tried to push these limits as high as possible. We were not competitive in every period of the last season and this season, it was was the same and is not easier. We always have periods where we are really struggling and to keep minimising these periods, I think, must be the goal for the future. The Premier League is getting better and better again and the other clubs have big opportunities. We must follow them, but go our own way. We do it with a special way and I think everybody knows that philosophy from this club.\u201d Meanwhile, he spoke of the dangers of rushing back too quickly from stubbed toes, as winger Sofiane Boufal continues his battle back following a tragic big toe/kitchen table interface. Hasenh\u00fcttl said: \u201cWe must pay attention because such an injury can take a long time if you are not careful.\u201d Here\u2019s RB Leipzig\u2019s Ademola Lookman, formerly of Everton and recently converted to Denzel Washington fandom, in conversation with Nick Ames \u2026 Steve Bruce is a happy bunny at Newcastle. His side host Southampton on Sunday on the back of last night\u2019s controversial victory over Sheffield United. We have had a really decent month and I have always said that a few results along the way helps everybody, so we\u2019ve given ourselves a nice platform going into the busy Christmas period \u2013 which is decisive for me. But the spirit among the players and their attitude and the way they are playing has delighted me and they carried it on after running a million miles against Manchester City on Saturday. They have showed some resilience again and I am very pleased, it stands us in good stead.\u201d Meanwhile, Andy Carroll, whose flick set Jonjo Shelvey running through unchallenged amid flag confusion, may be back on the bench for the weekend\u2019s game out after making his first start of the season on Thursday \u2013 Joelinton looks in line to replace a player whose capacity to start more than once a week was in question when the Magpies brought him back to the club. Sean Dyche\u2019s Burnley visit Spurs tomorrow. The Clarets\u2019 manager saw his side beaten 4-1 at home to Burnley on Tuesday, and he lamented that the Premier League \u201cis not a level playing field\u201d: You can put your wits against Pep Guardiola but I haven\u2019t got a team worth half-a-billion pounds or whatever it is. It is not a level playing field, everyone knows that. We look forward to what is a good opportunity to recover good form because we\u2019ve had a couple of slips this week, although one was against Man City. There are some games coming we think we can definitely compete in.\u201d Ashley Barnes could return after missing the midweek defeat following a groin injury, and Dyche gave some encouragement to on-loan midfielder Danny Drinkwater, who finally made his league debut for the club against City: There is no measure on that performance (against City). We know he needs true Premier League fitness, as in game time. It is difficult to shortcut true Premier League fitness, it does take time and he knows that. He has been around the game long enough, he knows Burnley Football Club is not a walk in the park, we don\u2019t stroll through the Premier League.\u201d A little more from Guardiola about Mikel Arteta\u2019s managerial credentials. He told Sky Sports News: He is ready. I\u2019m not a guy that puts a gun to the heads of my staff or players and says what they have to do. We are human beings and everyone has dreams and desires. Hopefully he can stay this season and the next one \u2013 as long as possible in this club. That would be my dream, but Mikel has his own life and I will never say what he has to do. I arrived here and we were in touch about working together and the time we have spent together has been magnificent. I tried to help him and he has helped me a lot. He knows what I want and what the club wants.\u201d The Manchester City manager said the club have not received any approaches for Arteta\u2019s services. Of potentially replacing him at City in the long-term, Guardiola added: \u201cHe is able to do that, but it depends on him, the club \u2013 many things that I cannot decide.\u201d Cheers Gregg, and hello again. Who wants to ruin football? Florentino P\u00e9rez, so says the Uefa president. This just in from the Associated Press: Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin criticised Real Madrid\u2019s president for reportedly planning a \u201cselfish and egotistical scheme\u201d to create world leagues, saying it would ruin soccer. Financial Times report, P\u00e9rez has approached financiers about backing the creation of two world leagues, each with 20 teams. It would rival Fifa\u2019s planned expansion of the Club World Cup from an annual seven-team competition to a 24-team event held every four years from 2021. While Fifa declined to say if its leadership had discussed the plan with P\u00e9rez, European soccer\u2019s governing body expressed public displeasure. \u201cI have read about this insane plan,\u201d Ceferin said in a statement. \u201cIf reports are to be believed, it comes from a single club president (not the owner) and a lone football administrator. It would be hard to think of a more selfish and egotistical scheme. It would clearly ruin football around the world; for the players, for the fans and for everyone connected with the game all for the benefit of a tiny number of people.\u201d It\u2019s a no from Ceferin, then. Stuart Goodwin is going to guide you through the afternoon\u2019s news now. While he jumps into the seat, read our story on the possible return of Nigel Pearson to the Premier League. Have a good weekend. Bye. It\u2019s a sorry state of affairs at Moss Rose, where Macclesfield\u2019s game against Crewe on Saturday has been \u201csuspended\u201d after Town informed the EFL they would be unable to fulfil the fixture. The announcement had been anticipated after Macclesfield\u2019s players released a statement saying they would refuse to play the League Two match due to non-payment of wages. The EFL has just released a statement that reads: Macclesfield Town has informed the EFL that they will not be in a position to fulfil Saturday\u2019s League Two fixture against Crewe Alexandra. As a result of this formal notification, the League has been forced to suspend the game and under EFL Regulations, the club is now deemed to be guilty of misconduct and will be referred to an Independent Disciplinary Commission. The EFL will now consider the matter of determining when the fixture will be played. Earlier this week the club\u2019s former manager Sol Campbell revealed that he was owed money by the club and backed the winding-up petition. Zinedine Zidane has confirmed that Gareth Bale will miss the next two games for Real Madrid (Espanyol and Club Brugge) as he continues his recovery from injury. Bale was able to do some light training, though, and by the looks of it he was fit enough to troll Spanish media with some golf swings. Aston Villa manager Dean Smith reckons Jack Grealish loves being kicked. The midfielder is the most fouled player in the Premier League, on average, getting hoofed up in the air almost five times a game ahead of Sunday\u2019s visit of Leicester. It\u2019ll frustrate him if they continually do it and not get cautioned but he takes pleasure in the fact they want to kick him. He gets up and gets on with it. Thanks Stuart. So, what do we make of the Nigel Pearson news, then? The Premier League\u2019s bottom club are in discussions with Nigel Pearson over their managerial vacancy. Any appointment would potentially be to the summer, when both parties would then reassess the situation. The former Leicester, Derby, Southampton and Hull manager was most recently in charge of Belgian side OH Leuven. One for the returning Gregg, armed with brew, to unpick. Thanks for reading, folks! One from overnight, in case you missed it: Southend manager Sol Campbell in conversation with Jonathan Liew \u2026 Guardiola adds that his assistant Mikel Arteta, linked to the vacancy at Arsenal, \u201cis ready\u201d for a managerial position. After saying he wants and expects him to remain in post for the rest of the season, he backed his credentials to step up. He will be here to the end of the season. I think so. He is ready \u2026 The time we have spent together here is magnificent. Shreeves asks if Arteta would make a good successor at the Etihad. \u201cYeah, definitely,\u201d Guardiola chortles. Manchester City\u2019s Pep Guardiola is braving the interrogation of Andrew Neil Geoff Shreeves on Sky Sports News \u2026 We are playing good. The way we play lately is not bad, I\u2019m satisfied. We judge results and one team is in incredible form \u2026 the way they are playing. The gap is what it is. We have to accept it. When you have this distance [to Liverpool], 11 points, is too far away. The best idea is how to chase Leicester \u2026 try to play good, try to maintain. On the Manchester derby \u2026 Tactically it\u2019s the same approach. Of course we can lose, play bad, our fans boo \u2013 it can happen! But I trust a lot in my players. Duncan Ferguson has been making his debut appearance as caretaker manager at Everton. He quite likes the idea of the word \u201ccaretaker\u201d being dropped from his title \u2026 I never hesitated. I\u2019m a coach at the moment so I don\u2019t think that is something I am considering at this time. It is a dream to be Everton manager but I am also realistic. Who wouldn\u2019t want to be manager of Everton? There will be many top managers who want this job.\u201d On Marco Silva \u2026 It is always not nice when a manager loses his job, we all felt for him. Everyone at the club supported him as best we could. It\u2019s unfortunate he lost his job but results determine that, don\u2019t they? It was a sad time. We\u2019ve got to pick the players up now.\u201d Mourinho also warned that Chelsea\u2019s transfer ban being lifted won\u2019t necessarily lead to insta-success for his former club \u2026 It\u2019s not easy to get better players than they have, they have very good players. I don\u2019t think even with a ban or even with a hypothetical multimillion budget to spend, I\u2019m not very, very sure they can get much better players than they have.\u201d Oh, but such impediment to work, Jos\u00e9 laments, giving himself a nice new nickname in the process \u2026 We have no time to work. After the United game yesterday was a day of complete recovery, today was the second recovery day \u2026 so the conditions to work on the pitch are not the best. So less work, more analyse, more meetings, more talk. I\u2019m not a meetings coach \u2013 I am a pitch coach, that\u2019s where I really like to coach. That\u2019s the way you can really accelerate all the process. He added, with his side already through in the Champions League, that he plans to rest several players against Bayern Munich on Wednesday. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was back in the purple puffa-puffa for the assembled press at Spurs. His side host Burnley tomorrow \u2026 We have to sort out the defence without losing what we have in attack. We concede two goals in each one of my four matches [to date] but we scored in all of them. We are conceding too much and we are conceding some, what I used to call \u2018cheap goals\u2019 \u2013 we have to try and stop it. The best way to do it is to work. Chelsea visit Big Dunc\u2019s Everton in Saturday\u2019s lunchtime kick-off. Frank Lampard has been smiling heartily at the prospect of signing players older than 11 or 12, thanks to 11.03\u2019s news re: the club\u2019s transfer ban being halved \u2026 Obviously the club was working towards that and it\u2019s a positive outcome for us. Now there\u2019s the potential to look at the market going forward, so I\u2019m pleased. [The January window] wasn\u2019t something to discuss at length until we knew the decision. The club have been working away putting forward our case, I\u2019ve been working away trying to get us doing OK on the pitch, and now it\u2019s a discussion we can start taking up. I\u2019m happy with the squad we have here, we\u2019re doing OK.\u201d Remember kids, swig your Vimto every time a football club links up with a brand you\u2019ve never heard of. Youku and Tmall are certainly new ones on me. This from Reuters, for those who buzz off this kind of thing \u2026 Premier League club Manchester United have agreed a partnership with e-commerce giant Alibaba in an effort to extend the club\u2019s engagement with fans in China. The deal will see Alibaba provide club content on its online video platform Youku and develop a future club store on the company\u2019s business-to-consumer platform Tmall.com. While existing Premier League broadcast deals restrict United from broadcasting live league matches on Youku, a leading online video service in China, United will have a dedicated club channel on the platform which will show a range of content. Full story on Brendan Rodgers\u2019s new contract now live \u2026 New on the site: Louise Taylor on Leeds\u2019 hopes of getting back up to the Premier League. They visit Huddersfield in tomorrow\u2019s West Yorkshire derby. What do Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela and Don Revie\u2019s famously formidable Leeds United team of the 1960s and 1970s have in common? The answer, potentially a fiendish pub quiz contender, is that all three have been recipients of the freedom of the city, with surviving members of Revie\u2019s squad receiving this rare civic honour as recently as Wednesday \u2026 Read it here \u2026 West Ham host Arsenal in the Monday night Premier League game. Manuel Pellegrini, whose side won at Chelsea and lost at Wolves in their last two matches, has been talking, with his side in 15th, two points above the relegation places \u2026 I said before those two games if we drew both of them it would be a good result. I worry more about the points we lost at home against Newcastle, Palace and Sheffield United \u2013 games that we deserved to win. With four or five points more we\u2019d be in eighth position in the table at this moment. That has passed and now we must try to be focused on the next game. We continue with [Lukas] Fabianski\u2019s recovery, also [Manuel] Lanzini \u2013 they will not be ready until the end of the month. Michail Antonio we must continue seeing \u2013 we\u2019ll see tomorrow if he\u2019s fit for the game. [Jack] Wilshere is working \u2013 also Winston Reid \u2013 with the squad.\u201d Leicester City chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha added lots of things about qualities, philosophies and visions: Brendan\u2019s qualities as a coach are well-known and evident in the way he has sought to unlock the potential in every member of our exciting young squad. But just as important to us is the suitability of Brendan\u2019s wider philosophy to the club\u2019s established culture and values. He and his staff immersed themselves immediately, building an understanding for the club and the city and an appreciation for what makes them special. That has been a valuable combination over the last nine months \u2013 strengthening the bond between our players, staff and supporters \u2013 and I\u2019m excited to see how it can continue to enhance our long-term vision for the club.\u201d THIS JUST IN, which may be of interest to Arsenal fans \u2013 one manager linked to their vacancy has signed a new five-and-a-half year deal at Leicester \u2026 Leicester City are delighted to announce that Brendan Rodgers has committed to a new contract with the Club to June 2025. Brendan Rodgers said: \u201cWhen I made the decision to come to Leicester City, it was because I was excited about the direction the club was taking and how I could apply my experience to the journey. I came here with a purpose to add something to that and to help the club build for the future. \u201cThe support I have had from the chairman, Khun Top; from the chief executive, Susan Whelan; from the director of football, Jon Rudkin; and from everyone at the club has been amazing. I\u2019ve inherited an outstanding team of staff that are dedicated to progress and improvement and we have a group of players that are a joy to work with every day. \u201cAnd to the club\u2019s supporters, I can only say thank you for welcoming me and my staff into your club and for putting your faith in our work. We\u2019ll continue to work together to bring success to Leicester City for many years to come.\u201d Seventh-placed Crystal Palace [SUBS PLS CHECK] visit manager-bereft basement club Watford tomorrow. Roy Hodgson has injury worries, but thinks he has enough square pegs to go around. PA Media report that: \u201cThe Palace manager will make a late call on the fitness of Scott Dann and Gary Cahill, with Mamadou Sakho suspended and Joel Ward, Patrick Van Aanholt and midfielder Max Meyer also ruled out.\u201d Hodgson said: You\u2019ve got to cope. I\u2019m more concerned in some ways about the injuries to [Joel] Ward and to Patrick van Aanholt because that does involve an awful lot of shifting around of players. At centre-back if we lose so many as we had on Tuesday night [the 1-0 win over Bournemouth], there was still Cheikhou Kouyate to go back there and do an excellent job that he so does so often for Senegal. He\u2019s capable of playing both positions. Because we have so many centre-backs, we use him in midfield but that doesn\u2019t mean to say he\u2019s not a very competent centre-back.\u201d Jamie Jackson assesses the fortunes (or otherwise) of both sides before tomorrow\u2019s Manchester derby \u2026 Chris Wilder has also been saying his piece on \u201cconsistently inconsistent\u201d VAR, after his Sheffield United side\u2019s defeat was sealed by Jonjo Shelvey\u2019s breakaway goal for Newcastle last night. The Blades\u2019 defence stopped after assistant referee Derek Eaton raised his flag, assuming an offside was about to be given against Andy Carroll, who had flicked the ball on. Play continued and replays showed that Carroll was fractionally onside. Wilder said \u2026 He\u2019s an unbelievably good actor is Jonjo, if he\u2019s telling me he knew \u2026 he strolled up to that ball and thought: \u2018I\u2019ll take a little bit of a chance and just roll it in, and see what happens. That\u2019s what he did. Don\u2019t kid yourself that he\u2019s through and he knew he was going to be in. Daniel Farke has been a-chattin\u2019, before Norwich host Sheffield United on Sunday. The two promoted sides have had differing fortunes this season, with the Blades in ninth while Norwich are second-bottom after Wednesday\u2019s 2-1 defeat to Southampton. We are still a newly-promoted side who have not spent any money, so in each and every second at this level we must be at our best. We told everyone before the season this would be a difficult challenge. It is important not to criticise them too much. It would be a better lesson if we had managed to come back [for a draw], but we also give them credit for the second half. We now have a home game and if we carry on in the way we finished this game then we have every chance of a win. It is not like Southampton played us out of the park, we were just bullied.\u201d Benjamin McIntyre mails with thoughts on Chelsea\u2019s new-found transfer freedom: \u201cI think Chelsea will be aware that they shouldn\u2019t rush out and sign anyone just because they can,\u201d he says. \u201cThe midfield is stacked with talent, with Loftus-Cheek still to come back, and the youngsters leading the line are ripping it up. I don\u2019t see why Lampard would want to tinker with that. \u201cThe only eventual targets they might have are at left-back as neither Alonso or Emerson have been performing consistency or a back-up striker as Chelsea are much less potent when Abraham can\u2019t lead the line. \u201cI\u2019d be very surprised to see those Zaha/Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 rumours get any real traction.\u201d In his first league start since January, Xherdan Shaqiri put in a superb performance against Everton, including a goal, and seemingly while wearing Philippe Coutinho\u2019s hair. More from Klopp \u2026 Shaq was injured twice with the same injury and it took time. The team was winning pretty much all the games, which was difficult. When you come on the pitch I expect the desire to show you are good enough. They all did that, Shaq did that especially. He was in a really good mood and really good shape and that\u2019s the situation where you can deliver a really good performance. Two of his side\u2019s standout performers on Wednesday were Sadio Man\u00e9 and Divock Origi. On Man\u00e9, Klopp said \u2026 Sadio\u2019s incredible. Since his first days he was an incredibly important player for us. I can still remember his first goal for us. He made big steps each year. Sadio, especially in the game against Barcelona here at home \u2026 it was like there were three of him. I\u2019m really happy for him. On two-goal Origi \u2026 Divock\u2019s unbelievably important for us. I was really happy that Mr [Belgium manager Roberto] Martinez was in the stadium. It was good he saw that. He needs to be in a confident mood and then everybody knows what he\u2019s able to do. The first was a brilliant pass from Sadio but the second was just a world-class goal. Afternoon all, bon appetit Gregg. And no sooner do I arrive, than Big J\u00fcrg\u2019s up, talking before Liverpool play Bournemouth tomorrow \u2026 On Marco Silva, whose time at Goodison Park ended after Everton were on the receiving end of a 5-2 shoeing \u2026 I feel for him. Since I\u2019m in England, Everton, how we all know, are an ambitious club with a big history. Marco is 100% an outstanding coach and manager. For sure it is not his fault but they thought they needed a change and that\u2019s the position of a manager. We all accept that.\u201d On Liverpool\u2019s December fixture crush \u2026 There are a lot of people who worry still and a lot of people who hope you fail. We know we are in a really, really difficult situation with the games coming up. We have to deal with it \u2026 we need to be lucky with the players, that they can stay fit and healthy. What that means for Christmas I never thought about. You need a smart squad, people with half a brain at least. It\u2019s not Fifa or PlayStation where they don\u2019t need a rest.\u201d Right, I\u2019m going to hand over to Stuart Goodwin for a bit. He\u2019ll guide you through the lunchtime press conferences. I may be back a little later on. Bye for now. Watford\u2019s caretaker manager Hayden Mullins wants to be a Bez-like vibes man while he is in charge. The Hornets played well in defeat at Leicester and they host his former club, Crystal Palace, tomorrow. Mullins wants there to be a feelgood atmosphere at Vicarage Road when Roy Hodgson\u2019s high-flyers visit. Palace are a side in form, but we are going to try to start with a high temp. We know we need to start fast. If we give the fans something to cheer about then they will be with us and we need them. We know it is a game we need to attack and get the fans going and loud with the team. We have to try to get positivity throughout the whole stadium. Sam Allardyce, Chris Hughton, Paul Clement and Quique Setien have all been linked with the vacant job but there has also been talk of Mullins being given the role until the end of the season if he impresses as a coach. He\u2019s currently the Under-23s manager and a positive result against Palace would strengthen his case for sticking around for a while longer. \u201cThe halving of the transfer ban is the worst possible outcome for Chelsea and Frank Lampard should now be very afraid,\u201d writes Karl Gibbons. \u201cNames like Zaha and Dembele should strike fear into not just Hudson-Odoi and Mount but all Chelsea fans. Going out and splashing the cash now will be a step backwards and I hope that the club\u2019s hierarchy realise this and approach with caution. Certainly, buy players but do not forget the joy that has arisen this season in seeing the club\u2019s \u2018youngsters\u2019 and perpetual loanees finally being given the room and opportunity to shine, and shine they have!\u201d As I type Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is managing Manchester United, Duncan Ferguson is manager of Everton and Frederick Ljungberg is Arsenal\u2019s boss. What\u2019s the perfect late-90s song to soundtrack that managerial trio? Chasing Rainbows? Who will Chelsea target in the transfer window? Two players are mentioned in today\u2019s edition of the Rumour Mill: Wilfried Zaha and Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. Ben Chilwell has been mentioned as a potential option, too. There\u2019s a huge match in the Bundesliga tomorrow, where league leaders M\u00f6nchengladbach host Bayern, who are languishing in fourth, a place above Dortmund. It\u2019s a big match anyway but for Bayern\u2019s interim manager Hans-Dieter Flick it\u2019s a family affair, too: Since my childhood Gladbach against Bayern was always a classic. In the house of Flick it was a classic as well, my brother was a Gladbach fan and I\u2019m a Bayern fan. We\u2019re on the right track and we will travel there with confidence. We showed good things against Leverkusen despite the defeat. We created many chances. Off the ball, some things were not good but we worked on them in training this week. The top of the Bundesliga table makes for interesting viewing: Here\u2019s our story on Chelsea\u2019s transfer ban being lifted in January: Breaking news! Chelsea can buy players in the January transfer window after the court of arbitration for sport announced that the two-window transfer ban has been halved. Here\u2019s an extract from Cas\u2019s statement. \u201cThe sole arbitrator found that CFC did violate Articles 19.1 (related to the international transfer of minors) and 19.3 (related to the first registration of minors), but for a significantly smaller number of players (about one third of the violations found by Fifa). In addition, the violations of other RSTP rules were found to be less serious than those attributed to Chelsea FC by FIFA. Accordingly, the Sole Arbitrator reduced the sanction to one single transfer ban (which Chelsea FC already served during the 2019 summer registration period), and halved the monetary sanction. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r couldn\u2019t help himself from opening a can of b@ntz and showering Manchester City with it when he was asked for his thoughts on the Manchester derby. Here\u2019s Jamie Jackson\u2019s hot take on the press conference: A view on Everton target Vitor Pereira from below the line. It\u2019s a slightly baffled one: Amazon has been heartily slapping itself on the back after declaring its first foray into broadcasting Premier League matches a success. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted that millions of football fans enjoyed watching Amazon\u2019s first ever round of Premier League matches on Prime Video,\u201d said Alex Green, managing director of Prime Video Sport Europe. \u201cWe are excited to be the first ever broadcaster to bring fans all 10 games live in a fixture round. We are thrilled and humbled by the positive response from Prime members not only to the production and streaming experience, but also the innovations we have introduced, such as integrated live match stats and highlights through X-Ray plus the ability to experience commentary-free stadium atmosphere.\u201d The coverage was fine but, personally, I find streaming a horrible way to watch football, which should be communal. Having to watch on a delay on your laptop isn\u2019t ideal, is it? Everyone knows a goal\u2019s been scored before you actually get to view it. Pubs that had Sky Sports on one TV and Amazon through their box on the other were effectively screening live spoilers. What next for Marco Silva, then? As ever, Barney Ronay gets to the essence of his subject in this brilliant piece: Aged 42 Silva is pretty much done in England, destined for China or Qatar, a one-man mystery story for future football historians. He does, though, still have a very good coat. There\u2019s some more from Eddie Howe here. He dismissed links with the Everton job and said his focus is on improving his Bournemouth team, who have dropped to 14th in the league after a sorry run of four straight defeats. Here\u2019s what he had to say about the Liverpool match: I\u2019m invigorated and energised to get results here. I have no problems with my energy levels, my enthusiasm, anything. This is a tough, tough league and we\u2019re in a tough moment. But these challenges are what inspires me. There\u2019s no bigger challenge than when I first took the job here in my first ever managerial appointment and we found a way out of a situation so we can find our way out of anything. We all need to collectively come together and show that unity and fight and challenge and that\u2019s what I\u2019m asking my players to do. A big blow for Howe tomorrow is that Harry Wilson is not available due to the loan agreement with Liverpool. He\u2019s scored six goals from midfield for the Cherries this season. Howe has defensive problems too. He\u2019ll be without Steve Cook (broken wrist) and Adam Smith (ankle) while the centre-forward Josh King (hamstring) is also missing. Duncan Ferguson is taking Everton training this morning and he\u2019s being assisted by John Ebbrell, Franny Jeffers and Alan Kelly. It\u2019s so very old school. I wonder if he\u2019s coaching this kind of approach to stopping Chelsea? On the Manchester derby itself, Solskj\u00e6r is hoping to have Anthony Martial fit and available but Paul Pogba is still out with an ankle injury. Martial was a doubt to face Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium after picking up a knock last weekend against Aston Villa that for Solskjaer expected to see him out \u201cfor a little while\u201d. But the France forward looks set to return. \u201cWe hope to have Anthony definitely for part of the game - I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s able to start,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cPaul probably won\u2019t be, no.\u201d Asked when he is expecting Pogba back, he said: \u201cAs soon as possible, as quickly as possible. He\u2019s out on the grass training. I said in 2019 so hopefully we\u2019ll see him before the New Year definitely.\u201d Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has arrived at Carrington to preview the Manchester derby but he has taken little time in laying into the Corriere dello Sport \u201cBlack Friday\u201d headline, which featured images of Chris Smalling and Romelu Lukaku alongside it. The paper has defended the headline despite widespread condemnation and accusations of racism but Solskj\u00e6r has a withering view of the Italian paper\u2019s editorial judgment. He has offered his support to his former player Lukaku and Smalling, who is on loan at Roma from Manchester United. See the paper? Wow. Really. Is that possible. It is the worst front page I have ever seen. It has to be. Of course we have been in touch with Chris, just so he knows that we\u2019ll back him and we support him. And with Romelu as well. I don\u2019t work in your line of business but, wow, that\u2019s incredible - and at least we don\u2019t see that here. We can see lots of different things but we don\u2019t see that, so that has to be stamped down [on]. Right, so who is going to inherit the sorry mess at Watford Arsenal Everton, then? Sky are reporting that the Toffees are set for talks with Vitor Pereira, the 51-year-old Portuguese manager of Shanghai SIPG. Why him, you ask? Apparently he was a contender to succeed David Moyes in 2013 before the club opted for Roberto Mart\u00ednez instead. And Eddie Howe, who is always first out of bed on a Friday for his Bournemouth press conference, has dismissed stories linking him with the job at Goodison. First of all, I am very disappointed for Marco. Secondly, I am 100% committed to this club and I am a little bit embarrassed with the speculation if I am honest after our recent run of results. It\u2019s come at a bad time because people will then question whether your work has been affected by what\u2019s being said outside. He\u2019s referring to a run of four defeats in a row in the Premier League \u2013 and they face Liverpool at the Vitality Stadium at 3pm tomorrow. Yikes! Do you want to know who the Guardian\u2019s best female footballer of 2019 is? Have a look at our complete top 100 list, then. It will certainly please Chelsea fans. It\u2019s that time of year when football just doesn\u2019t stop. With the fading boos at Arsenal signalling that the midweek Premier League matches having only just finished we\u2019re already on to previewing this weekend\u2019s fixtures, the pick of which is Saturday evening\u2019s Manchester derby. Duncan Ferguson\u2019s temporary managerial bow when Everton take on Chelsea in Saturday\u2019s early kick-off will be worth keeping an eye on, too, mind. Given his hands-on approach to dealing with troubling situations in the past, there will certainly be a reaction from his Toffees after their midweek Merseyside derby mauling. He\u2019s also going to have to speak to journalists today. That could be a lot of fun. Here is the list of Premier League fixtures: Saturday Everton v Chelsea 12.30pm Bournemouth v Liverpool 3pm Spurs v Burnley 3pm Watford v Crystal Palace 3pm Manchester City v Manchester United 5.30pm Sunday Aston Villa v Leicester 2pm Newcastle v Southampton 2pm Norwich v Sheffield United 2pm Brighton v Wolves 4.30pm Monday West Ham v Arsenal 8pm Take a look at the latest Premier League table here and if you\u2019re wondering what you should be looking out for this weekend, this might help:"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
