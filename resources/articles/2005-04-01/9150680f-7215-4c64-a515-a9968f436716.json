On the May 5 ballot paper there will be only the simplest of choices: Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat, others. Yet those stark, bald words hardly hint at the options voters actually want. Take those people who usually put a cross by the word \"Labour\". This time many of them would like to vote for an option marked \"Return a Labour government, but with a sharply reduced majority so that Tony Blair learns the lesson of the Iraq war\". Or they might be drawn to one that read \"Allow Labour to keep going on domestic policy, but administer a bloody-nose for its antics abroad\". Others, perhaps for similar reasons, might yearn to place their pencil mark alongside the concise words, \"Labour without Blair\". Trouble is, none of these options will be on the ballot paper. There will be some ultra-calculating types wondering how best to achieve a more specific outcome: Labour led by Gordon Brown. They might think a small majority would be best for that, weakening Blair so badly that he rapidly made way for his rival. Mind you, that would see Brown handed a much-reduced inheritance, an administration that existed on parliamentary life support. Perhaps a large majority would be better? But that might give Blair the confidence to eject his neighbour from No 11, offering him the lesser post of foreign secretary. What's a Brown-supporting Labourite to do? The ballot paper is dumb, offering no help. Conservatives have dilemmas of their own. For those who want to remove Blair and install Michael Howard in Downing Street, it's easy: they just have to put their X on the spot. But what of the modernising strain of Tory? Plenty of them privately fear a large Conservative surge on election day. If the party wins a respectable haul of seats, then not only will Howard remain as leader but Tories will delude themselves that they need not undergo drastic change in order to win back power. Instead they will conclude that just \"one more heave\" is required in 2009. For the modernisers, who reckon the Tories need the kind of wholesale transformation endured by Labour in the 1990s, this would be the worst possible outcome. If they cannot win outright on May 5, they would rather lose badly. Now how do you express that on a ballot paper in just two strokes of the pencil? If Liberal Democrats are honest, they know they are not voting for a prime minister when they plump for Charles Kennedy. Their truthful ideal would be a hung parliament, where they could extract from Labour the promise that has tantalised them for generations: electoral reform for the House of Commons. But effecting a hung parliament is a complex business. Tactical voting required computer technology when it was a mere matter of defeating Tories. It would take Nasa-style hardware to work out how to produce a hung parliament - and few voters carry that kind of kit. So voters may want to send all sorts of messages and deliver a whole range of finely calibrated judgments next month - but we cannot. Our choices are of the yes/no, black/white variety. They don't call it a simple majority for nothing. How the parties handle this fact is revealing. Tories and Lib Dems try to pretend it's not true. For Labour, it's a secret weapon. Start with the Conservatives. In their opening event yesterday, they launched what was almost a slogan: wipe the smile from Tony Blair's face. Howard said his party offered an alternative to the \"smirking politics of Mr Blair\" and warned that the prime minister was \"already secretly grinning at the prospect of his third victory\". This sounded less like a case for forming the next government than an appeal to the widespread urge not to remove Blair from power - but to take him down a peg or two. As if that could be achieved by a vote for the Conservatives. The reality is that, if everyone made that same move, the Tories would win an outright victory. But it suits Howard to pretend that's not true: that Blair would still be there, only his smirk would have vanished. When the Lib Dems go hunting for protest votes they are playing the same game. Labour has two responses. The first is to blunt the appeal of its rivals' approach. Accordingly, Tony Blair, in his first statement of the new campaign, spoke almost exclusively yesterday of those matters where he hopes the electorate still back him, despite everything. It was all economic stability, education and the NHS. His reference to the international affairs which have dominated, if not devoured, Labour's second term was confined to a single sentence fragment: \"A country that protects itself against the terrorist threat that we face.\" With that, he signalled that the British election of 2005 will be utterly unlike the US contest of 2004, which was largely fought on George Bush's favourite terrain of \"security\". Blair has clearly reasoned that the issue won't play for him the same way. Far from being a vote winner, it will simply stir up unhappy memories for the very people Blair needs most: disaffected Labour supporters. But Labour's second line of attack is no less crucial. It will ceaselessly repeat that May 5 is not a referendum on the government, nor on the personality of the prime minister, nor on the morality of the Iraq war. If those were the questions, it fears the answer would be a vigorous thumbs-down. Instead, it will say that May 5 is a simple, straightforward choice: who do you want to govern the country for the next four or five years, Labour or the Conservatives? There is a political purpose behind this, of course: if they ask the right question, they hope the electorate will give the right answer. They surely know that there are countless, maybe millions of Labour voters who loathed the Iraq invasion - but who nevertheless like what the government has done for schools, hospitals and the overall quality of life in Britain. What they need to tell this group, over and over, is that if they voice their indignation over the former, either with an abstention or a non-Labour vote, they risk the latter - by inadvertently letting in a Tory government. Labour's problem until now has been making people believe it: their dominance has been so secure for so long that, party bigwigs fear, it is now taken for granted. Voters reckon they can do what they like - backing all kinds of alternatives on May 5 - and Labour will still get in. Shaking this complacency has become a Labour obsession. Which is why the only people happier than the Tories at yesterday's clutch of polls showing the Conservatives gaining ground were Labour. They need their natural supporters to rediscover their fear of the Tories - to believe that a gesture on May 5 could lead to Prime Minister Howard on May 6. On this point, crude though it may be, Labour is right. There is no way of voting for a chastened Labour government, its wings clipped. If everyone who wanted that outcome withheld their vote, the result would be a Tory victory. For the vote is a blunt instrument. Collectively we can use it to deliver a subtle, nuanced verdict. On our own, we can only make one decision: who do we want to govern the country? \u00b7 freedland@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
