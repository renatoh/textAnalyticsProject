Woody Johnson used an interview with Bloomberg on Friday to attempt to calm the diplomatic storm created by Trump\u2019s retweets of videos from the far-right group Britain First, which prompted Britain\u2019s ambassador to Washington complain to the White House. \u201cThe president and the prime minister have a very, very good relationship. I know the president admires and respects the prime minister greatly,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI know that the prime minister was one of the first, the first visitor to the White House after the inauguration.\u201d He added: \u201cMy job and the president\u2019s job is to protect Americans. He\u2019s doing the best that he can. You\u2019re going to have little stumbles along the road. Absolutely. You\u2019re going to have things that happen. But the intent is there and it\u2019s genuine, and it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d May criticised Trump\u2019s sharing of the extremist material, saying it had been \u201cwrong\u201d. But the president followed up his initial retweets with a riposte to the prime minister in which told her to concentrate on fighting terrorism in the UK. Politicians from across Britain\u2019s main parties lined up to criticise Trump\u2019s behaviour on Thursday, with many calling for the offer of a state visit to be formally withdrawn. May passed on an invitation from the Queen for a full state visit when she visited Trump at the White House days after his inauguration. The invitation was accepted \u2013 but privately few in government expect it to take place in the foreseeable future. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, condemned Trump\u2019s retweets on Thursday, but urged MPs to focus on the \u201cbigger picture\u201d of Britain\u2019s relationship with the US over the long term. \u201cAs home secretary I can tell the house that the importance of the relationship between our countries, the unparalleled sharing of intelligence between our countries, it has undoubtedly saved British lives. That is the bigger picture here and I would urge people to remember that,\u201d she said. Johnson took a similar stance in his conciliatory interview on Friday, saying: \u201cOur special relationship with the UK is centuries old and it\u2019s been well tested through thick and thin, but it\u2019s based on trust. \u201cAnd trust is something that you earn over a long period of time. And I think trust is 100% there and so we will get past all these things and get on with our main job and leadership in the world, which needs leadership.\u201d Johnson, a billionaire Republican donor and owner of the New York Jets NFL team, also claimed he liked the weather in the UK, finding it to be better than he had expected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
