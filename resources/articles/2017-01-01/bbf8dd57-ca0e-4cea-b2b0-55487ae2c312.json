The 19-year-old forward made a sensational debut against Manchester City last Sunday, coming on for the last four minutes of the game and managing to score the final goal in a 4-0 victory, and Koeman explained he was happy to give him his chance so early because he already liked what he had seen in training. \u201cI think we will be keeping him fairly close to the first team,\u201d the Everton manager said. \u201cI am really impressed by the young boy and what he is showing us. Not just in the last couple of minutes against Man City, although that was a big moment for the boy and everybody else because it made the result that bit more special, but you can tell from his attitude and his quality in the training sessions that he can be a really top player.\u201d Lookman only joined the club a few days before making his debut but at no time, according to Koeman, did he appear nervous or overawed by the prospect of stepping up to Premier League level. \u201cHe came from a lower league team, and with all due respect, you think he might take a bit of time to get used to working at a higher intensity,\u201d Koeman said. \u201cBut even with his age and without any experience of the Premier League he showed his quality straight away. You could tell by the reaction of the rest of the players. Footballers only take a day or two to work out whether a new signing is any good or not, they know almost straight away, and they saw a player working at their own intensity. \u201cI am not saying that Ademola doesn\u2019t have anything to learn, but he is starting from a good position. It was already a big compliment to him that he was part of the squad last weekend, ahead of several other players with more experience, and based on what we have already seen I would not be afraid to give him a start.\u201d That might not come at Crystal Palace on Saturday \u2013 after last weekend\u2019s performance there are no extra injuries and no obvious need for Koeman to change his team \u2013 though the manager is keen to stress Everton need to keep their feet on the ground and not get carried away by one impressive victory. \u201cIf you win 4-0 it is a big result, and the players enjoy training that little bit more in the week that follows, but we can\u2019t keep celebrating one game because in football you always have to prepare for the next one,\u201d he said. \u201cThat applies to the young players especially.\u201d In addition to Lookman, the 18-year-old midfielder Tom Davies also scored his first goal last week, and being a home-grown product, not to mention a nephew of the 1969-70 title winner Alan Whittle, the player has found himself the centre of attention. \u201cTom needs to learn to deal with that attention but we will help him,\u201d Koeman said. \u201cHe is a young player who took his chance in the first team, he is entitled to be happy about that, but if he starts to think he is the big man at Everton we will do something to help him keep his two feet on the ground. Just this week we have been showing him clips of some of the things he could have done better against City, just so he knows it wasn\u2019t quite a perfect performance, but he is a good boy and a really hard working player. We are not expecting him to lose focus or start to get sloppy.\u201d Everton still have a lot of ground to make up if they are to finish any higher than seventh, and few imagine Koeman will be able to crack the top six in his first season, though the manager has a simple philosophy. \u201cDon\u2019t look ahead of yourself, just concentrate on winning your games and see where you end up,\u201d he said. \u201cI was impressed by the whole team last weekend, we did a good job. Now we must prepare ourselves for Palace. They might be struggling a little but they still have good players and they are strong at home.\u201d Meanwhile, Gerard Deulofeu is heading to Milan after Everton reached agreement on his loan move until the end of the season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
