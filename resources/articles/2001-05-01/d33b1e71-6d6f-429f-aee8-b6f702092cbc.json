There usually is. Emotional incontinence is not part of his make-up, and it was that quality of inherent calmness that enabled him bring the FA Cup to Liverpool on Saturday. An hour after the final whistle he was putting his remarkable achievement behind him and talking soberly of the two \"massive\" games to come this week, against Alaves in Dortmund on Wednesday and away to Charlton in the Premiership on Saturday. And, tellingly, of the necessity \"not to sit back and sulk\" when the manager tells him he will be spending the afternoon on the bench, as had happened to him in the final of the Worthington Cup 11 weeks earlier. In this respect Owen is wiser than some of his admirers, who would see him start every game of the season on the grounds that a striker is dependent on others working to sustain his self-confidence. Not Owen. The 21-year-old does not require psychological inflation because he does not doubt his own ability in the first place. He knows that injury or circumstance can conspire to give him bad days, but nothing can erode his belief in his own skills, a belief that is hardly likely to be damaged by missing the odd game in the cause of maintaining his own freshness and the morale of the squad. This inbuilt sense of clarity explains why, in the maelstrom of the Arsenal penalty area in the 83rd minute, he could find the space and time to slant his body in a way which allowed him, even as his standing foot was sliding from under him, to volley the ball at an angle and an elevation that eluded the goalline blockers. That was why, five minutes later, he could control Patrik Berger's long pass with a single touch of his right foot and hit a cross shot with his left that eluded David Seaman's hand and gave Liverpool the match. And that is why we can now add Cardiff to the lengthening list of places in which Owen has scored magnificent goals in matches at the highest level - although, as he pointed out, Saturday's goals meant more even than the career-defining slalom through the Argentine defence, since they secured the winning of a trophy. Jimmy Greaves had the same quality of cold-blooded precision within an environment of high emotion. Romario had the same instant decisiveness. They, too, were still boys when it became apparent that they were in possession of a priceless gift that practice can sharpen but nothing can implant. And Owen, it seems, is lucky enough to have a similar temperament off the field. By contrast, look at Thierry Henry, a resplendent talent who should have won Saturday's match for Arsenal. Time and again he picked up the ball with a glorious touch and swayed away from one or two opponents in a burst of vivid acceleration that set the whole Liverpool defence off balance. But instead of tightening his mental focus on the end product, Henry wanted to hit his cross or his shot with the same casual elegance he had used to start the move. If he was unlucky when his exquisite shot inside the near post hit St\u00e9phane Henchoz's elbow, then he had plenty of opportunities to redeem the disappointment and spurned them all. Liverpool, a dejected but unfailingly courteous Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said on Saturday night, will probably win the Premiership next season. \"Oh, he's just trying to put pressure on us,\" G\u00e9rard Houllier responded with a grin. But as his players returned to training yesterday in the wake of their second cup win of the season, Anfield's French manager knew that ahead of them lies a week in which they can solidify their claim to be Manchester United's principal rivals for honours next year. \"I personally think that Manchester United are far above us at the moment,\" Houllier said, repeating one of his mantras. \"This team did not really start until 1999, when Westerveld and Henchoz and Hyypia and Hamann came. So it's still young and it's still developing. Today I was disappointed with the passing from the back, which was a bit erratic. We're not used to that. But you have to understand it. It takes time. \"The difference between us and Manchester United is that they can go to Bradford and it's 0-0 after 70 minutes and they score and it's finished. That clinical aspect, we don't have it yet. We have other assets. We're strong. We're solid. But we need to have that, too.\" Owen's eight goals in four games over a 10-day period at the very height of the season speak volumes for the effectiveness of Houllier's stewardship of his large squad. \"Football is difficult enough,\" he said, \"but if people start to think only about themselves - 'I should play, he shouldn't play' - first of all it shows a lack of respect for their team-mates, and second you're on the way down to defeat. You're not certain to win if you're together, but you've no chance to win if you're not together. That's what I know.\" His concern for maintaining a powerful team spirit is never achieved at the expense of providing his players with an honest assessment of their task, and before the final he had been typically realistic. \"I said to the boys that I think Arsenal are probably a bit better than us, probably more experienced and mature when you look at some of their players, probably with more ability in some areas, but what's going to make the difference between the two teams today is the mental strength, the capacity to deal with negative events in a game. I said if you've got the moral courage not to let your head go down for more than one minute, you'll be strong. And on some occasions the will to win is more important than the skill to win.\" For 80 minutes Arsenal's performance had frightened him - \"Keown and Adams ... outstanding!\" - but when Owen scored his first goal he saw the balance of the game tilt in a way that reminded him of France's victory over Italy in the European championship final last year. \"Suddenly the confidence switches to the other camp. They're affected, they become a bit unsettled, and you keep going.\" On the field, one player had a particular understanding of the phenomenon. Two years ago Markus Babbel was in the Bayern Munich side that took a 1-0 lead into injury-time against Manchester United in the European Cup final in the Nou Camp. Now he was part of the team clawing its way back from the brink of defeat. \"After Barcelona I'm ready to believe anything,\" Liverpool's German full-back said on Saturday evening. \"When we equalised I looked at the clock and I thought, OK, everything is possible. We had a lot of luck but next time we have to play better. We won't always get away with this.\" But as long as Michael Owen is around, they will always have a chance. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
