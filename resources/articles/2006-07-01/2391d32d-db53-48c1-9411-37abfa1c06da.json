Bringing together those works with the better known Carnaval makes perfect sense, not only because all three explore ideas of dance and masked celebrations, but because as a sequence they show how Schumann's concept of the piano cycle evolved, from the brightly lit succession of miniatures that make up Papillons through the more expressively varied sequence of Carnaval to the much more structured and musically complex plan of Faschingsschwank. Stefan Vladar seems more comfortable with the later pieces; his performances of Papillons and Carnaval are sometimes a little too insistent, too overbearing, and risk losing their simple charm, though his rhythmic shaping is always intelligent. But he projects the stronger outlines of Faschingsschwank with real authority, and exactly the kind of elan that Schumann's piano writing always needs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
