By summer he may no longer be in east Lancashire; the Burnley president has promised he will see out the last year of his contract, though he is a free agent at the end of the season and has already been linked with several clubs. But Ings is keeping a single-minded focus on the present. \u201cAge-wise I am eligible for the summer tournament if selected and obviously I would love to go,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee selection, of course, but it is nice to know I am in the manager\u2019s plans and my own plan is to give myself the best possible chance by doing as well as I can for the rest of the season. I would then hope the Under-21s could be a springboard into the senior squad because that\u2019s the dream, to play for the seniors regularly. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve always wanted to do, an ambition I will never give up on. At the moment I am only just starting to get noticed but I\u2019m still young, still developing and hopefully, if I ever get the opportunity, I will be able to take it.\u201d While Ings is a relative veteran next to some of the teenage talents who go straight into the full England side with hardly any involvement in the Under-21s, a player released as a schoolboy by Southampton knows how precarious football development can be. He had to sign on as an apprentice at Bournemouth\u2019s centre of excellence before Eddie Howe gave him his first professional contract in 2010. After a couple of years at Dean Court and a few months on loan at Dorchester Town he followed his first manager north to Turf Moor. Reaching the Championship at 18 represented swift progress for Ings yet his reunion with Howe proved short-lived. Once the manager returned south for personal reasons his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was left with a four-year contract at the sort of northern outpost, albeit a friendly one, where he could never have imagined his career might blossom. \u201cI haven\u2019t caught the northern accent yet even though I have been here quite a while,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce at Burnley I only played a handful of games under Eddie Howe but by the time he went back I had a few friends around me. I owe Eddie a lot. He gave me my first contract, he was my mentor in the early stages of my career. He put me in the right direction and did a lot for my development. You could say I\u2019m only here because he believed in me.\u201d That was after Burnley\u2019s first promotion to the Premier League with Owen Coyle, but in no time the club were on the rise again under Sean Dyche. Ings was very much a part of the push for promotion, weighing in with 21 Championship goals after Charlie Austin\u2019s departure in late pre-season left him as the club\u2019s main striker. \u201cCharlie was a goalscorer and a massive loss for us but it did give me the opportunity to play more as a striker,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore that I was being played in different positions which was good for my development but not quite what I wanted. \u201cMy preferred position has always been striker and I think I managed to show what I could do. I scored enough goals to help us to where we are today. But last season was all about the lads being in it together \u2013 it wasn\u2019t about individuals, it was about building a team ethic. \u201cThe new gaffer is fantastic. Since he has come in he has brought the best out of everyone and laid down his own philosophy. He\u2019s got us as fit as we can possibly be, everybody knows we are a pressing team and he makes us believe in our own ability. \u201cNow we are in the Premier League he tells us to show that we deserve to be here and look as if we are enjoying it. He wants us to play with smiles on our faces which is exactly the right approach, I think. We are lucky to be doing this, not everyone gets the chance.\u201d Playing with a smile on his face comes quite naturally to Ings in any case. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely enjoying the Premier League, as you can imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew it was going to be tough. It\u2019s the best league in the world and you are up against players who have been in it for years so they know it inside out. It\u2019s a new experience for me, coming up from the lower leagues, but I\u2019m starting to grow into it. I think I\u2019m building a reputation week by week. Now I\u2019ve started scoring a few goals I believe I can be a threat to other teams but I\u2019m not settling for what I have achieved already. \u201cThe plan is to improve even more, to try and be the best I can be. I know what I have to do whether it\u2019s in the gym, out on the grass \u2013 or all the tactics behind it. I\u2019m working hard on putting all those things together.\u201d Not the biggest or most imposing centre-forward at 5ft 10in, Ings believes he is seeing results from gym work aimed at building up his core strength. \u201cI\u2019ve had a strict gym plan for a few years now to try and improve my power and my speed,\u201d he says. \u201cThis year I\u2019m really feeling the benefits from it. Being outside on the grass is the easy, enjoyable part of being a footballer. I feel it is the stuff in the gym that has really helped me improve. I\u2019m going to carry on with that because I can feel it has made a difference.\u201d If Ings can look after himself on the pitch so, he feels, can Burnley. There were a few initial worries when the newly promoted side took so long to register a win but once the first goals and points arrived there was recognition that they would be a competitive force in the bottom third of the table. \u201cThere was a lot of outside noise about us not winning a game for so long but we never stopped believing in ourselves,\u201d Ings says. \u201cOur performances were going extremely well but results weren\u2019t happening at first. As soon as we turned that round you could suddenly see the belief in the squad. We had had it all along but now we could play with confidence. We feel we are capable of putting a mark on the league. You are in your own mini-league at the bottom but we know we can cause other teams problems and I think we have every chance of staying up. \u201cNo one turns up at Turf Moor thinking we are a soft touch. Teams coming here are more likely to think \u2018These boys go hard; they don\u2019t give up\u2019, and we don\u2019t. That\u2019s the mentality we have. We developed it last season. I remember going two down at Millwall and showing the resilience to fight back and that\u2019s not something you see from every team. We give our all. We make it as hard as we possibly can for opponents. I don\u2019t think anyone is taking us for granted.\u201d Last year Ings was inspired to start a charity project for disabled sports fans after being moved by the reaction of a young Burnley supporter in a wheelchair, Joseph Skinner, who was presented with the striker\u2019s boots at the end of a game. \u201cI just handed the little lad my boots, I didn\u2019t even realise a photograph was being taken but before I reached the dressing room the picture had gone viral,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I studied the photograph I could see what it meant to the lad and it made me realise I could make a difference to other people\u2019s lives.\u201d In conjunction with the club\u2019s community programme, the Danny Ings Disability Sport Project has just launched in several local schools \u2013 there were too many Championship games for it to commence last season \u2013 and the player insists the initiative will follow his football career around. \u201cWherever I am in the future it will still be running in Burnley and the bigger I can become in football the more projects I\u2019ll open,\u201d he says. \u201cThis one is the first of many.\u201d Ings will be free to talk to potential clubs in the new year but wherever he finds himself playing in future \u2013 Ajax are reportedly among his admirers \u2013 a homely Lancashire town put him on the map. \u201cNo matter what happens in my career Burnley will always have a place in my heart because I have been here for four years and this club has turned me from a boy into a man,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as we came up the job was to keep Burnley in the Premier League and it still is. Hopefully I can score some more goals to help because keeping the club in the Premier League would really mean the world to me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
