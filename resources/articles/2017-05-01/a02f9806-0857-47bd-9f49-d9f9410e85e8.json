Having already selected the Sale wing Denny Solomona in his squad for the tour to Argentina, Jones cast an eye over the full-back Jason Woodward at last week\u2019s training camp and raised a few eyebrows when announcing the 30-year-old Gloucester scrum-half Willi Heinz for the three-day get together on the south coast. \u201cI don\u2019t control who qualifies and who doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s not my job. You\u2019re talking to the wrong person. My job is to pick players who qualify to play for England,\u201d said Jones, who has also picked the Worcester and former South Africa Under-20s prop Nick Schonert for the Brighton training camp. \u201cIf you have a problem with how they qualify, speak to the people who make those rules because I don\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t care how they qualify, I\u2019ll pick them. That\u2019s the rules we play under. I obey them like a good schoolteacher does. [Heinz] has got a good feel for the game, but you\u2019ve got to remember we\u2019re bringing him in for this training camp only. And I wouldn\u2019t be making a big song and dance about it.\u201d Heinz and Woodward have entirely legitimate claims \u2013 they both have English grandparents \u2013 and, while they may face the Barbarians on 29 May in an uncapped fixture, neither is in the touring party for Argentina. Jones played down their inclusion in the camp, claiming he was working with players \u201cseventh or eighth choice in their position\u201d with those from the four Premiership semi-finalists Wasps, Exeter, Saracens and Leicester \u2013 as well as Northampton, who have a Champions Cup play-off on Saturday, and 15 British &amp; Irish Lions \u2013 all unavailable. The timing of their selection is not aided however by the fact that last week the World Rugby council voted to extend the residency rule from three to five years from 2020 \u2013 Solomona being the most recent player to qualify for England within the 36-month time frame. It is also hardly a glowing endorsement of the English age-grade system, despite the under-20 side claiming the Six Nations grand slam this year. However, asked if he was overlooking young English players, Jones added: \u201cTell me. Who is there? I look at everything. You don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done my homework? You\u2019re suggesting I haven\u2019t done my homework. I\u2019m picking the best players available to play for England. \u201cEvery player who is qualified to play for England has an opportunity to play for England. I select them and if they don\u2019t want to play they say no. Everyone has a choice. They either want to play for England or they don\u2019t and they show that by the way they train and the way they behave. That\u2019s the greatest indication of whether they want to play for England.\u201d If Northampton beat Connacht on Saturday they will have a play-off final for the last place in the Champions Cup the same weekend of the Barbarians match, meaning Jones would not have his captain, Dylan Hartley, available. The vice-captains Billy Vunipola and Owen Farrell are also unavailable though his third, Mike Brown, is. Senior players overlooked for the Lions squad such as Chris Robshaw, James Haskell, Joe Launchbury and George Ford would also come into contention. \u201cI want to see how the guys come into camp,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe are dealing with some blokes who are disappointed about the Lions. So we will see how they come into camp and how they perform will give me an indication of who I push forward as a leader.\u201d England will begin the defence of their Six Nations title away to Italy next year and conclude the 2018 campaign at home to Ireland on St Patrick\u2019s Day. The organisers yesterday announced the fixtures for 2018 and 2019 with both championships featuring two rest weeks, as was the case this year. Wales, who will have Warren Gatland back at the helm, host the first match of next year\u2019s championship at home to Scotland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
