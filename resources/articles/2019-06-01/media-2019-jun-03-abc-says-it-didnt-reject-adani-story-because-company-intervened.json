Guardian Australia asked the ABC why a story by radio current affairs reporter Isobel Roe had not been broadcast and if it had anything to do with a direct call made by Adani spokeswoman Kate Campbell to Morris. \u201cThere was no complaint,\u201d an ABC spokeswoman told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe only communication we received from Adani was a request for more time to respond to our questions. In light of the need to provide parties with a fair opportunity to respond and the strength of the other stories in the mix for Saturday AM, the decision was taken at an editorial level to not proceed with the story.\u201d ABC sources said Roe was preparing a report for Saturday AM on Friday 24 May which looked at the economics of Adani\u2019s Carmichael mine. But after calling Campbell for a response, the spokeswoman called Morris directly. Roe was later told by her managers not to proceed with her report. The story Roe was following up was by Bloomberg reporter David Fickling, who argued in a series of tweets that the economics of the Carmichael mine \u201cdon\u2019t stack up\u201d. Fickling later had a piece published in the Australian Financial Review on the subject. \u201cAdjusting that for the cost of transporting the coal to port on third-party networks comes to about $US50 a ton of operating costs, or $US500 million for the whole project, enough to leave $US160m of gross profit,\u201d Fickling wrote. The heavy-handed tactics by Adani follow revelations in Guardian Australia the company lodged several Freedom of Information requests about ABC reporters who had covered Adani projects. ABC investigative reporters Mark Willacy and Michael Slezak were asked for documents relating to news reports on allegations Adani was illegally drilling bore holes. These requests were made by Adani lawyers AJ &amp; Co, and follow revelations they planned to confront Adani critics including activists and journalists by acting like \u201ca well-trained police dog\u201d. Most of the FOI requests were denied and the only documents that were released were Willacy and Slezak\u2019s travel and accomodation costs and some heavily redacted phone logs. The ABC\u2019s Media Watch also investigated the spiking of Roe\u2019s story and spoke to staff who overheard conversations about it in the ABC\u2019s Sydney newsroom. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s nothing to do with you, but we\u2019re not going to be able to run this,\u201d was one conversation reported by Media Watch on Monday night. \u201cIt\u2019s not my decision, it\u2019s come from on high,\u201d was a second conversation reported by the program. Despite the ABC\u2019s claim there was \u201cno complaint\u201d Media Watch says Adani told them they did complain about Roe\u2019s story before it was broadcast. \u201c\u2026 we raised concerns with ABC management when approached to comment on a story that contained inaccuracies and was potentially biased,\u201d an Adani spokesperson told the ABC. Media Watch host Paul Barry said the spiking of the story \u201csends a terrible message to ABC journalists trying to do their job and also to ABC viewers who trust the ABC to give frank and fearless coverage of matters of public importance\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
