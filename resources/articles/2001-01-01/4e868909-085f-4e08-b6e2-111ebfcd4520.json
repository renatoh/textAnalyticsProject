It was set up in a rush in 1975 to coincide with the establishment of the Equal Pay and Sex Discrimination Acts, legislation intended to expedite a new world for women and ethnic minorities. Initially a sickly child, the EOC, under its chair of two years Julie Mellor, has begun to show teeth - but what of the state of women? A quarter of a century ago, the 42nd attempt to get equal pay on to the statute books was finally successfully guided by Barbara Castle, then minister of employment. Companies were given five years to adjust. Not untypically, one company issued a list of \"discrimination factors\", among them the willingness to work overtime. The lads were kept ahead of the girls who were instantly handicapped because of the kids at home. And now? These are contradictory times. Some say the battle is over, others are too exhausted to know, while if polemicists are to be believed, men have cause to be mad about women. With the collapse of heavy industry and the high divorce rate, some men argue that they are emasculated and excluded from home and work, forced into what was once the woman's role: second-class citizen. The EOC is using its celebrations to challenge some of this thinking. Aware that equality for women has always required that men, too, should be liberated from the straitjacket of gender stereotyping, it has commissioned research which analyses how far women and men have actually come. Does the traditional breadwinner rest in peace? An increasing number of men under 35 look after their children - it's just that they don't call it childcare. According to one study, 80% of 18-24-year-olds disagree that \"a man's job is to earn the money; a woman's . . . to look after the home and family\". The EOC is calling for a national debate on how to forge a social contract for the 21st century between men and women, employers and employees, government and the electorate. One that draws on notions of modern citizenship and builds on Labour's recognition that childcare and the work-life issue is no longer a private affair but a central part of its economic strategy and a matter of social justice. More persuasive than rhetoric, however, is the clout carried by profit and loss. Put bluntly, the present jalopy of a system - in which the average male works a 47-hour week and the family remains invisible - costs a packet. For instance, days lost to stress alone are estimated to cost British industry\u00a33.8bn per year. At the same time, the rewards of those (few) businesses who are pro-active are obvious. One recent survey of the FTSE-100 companies showed that the quarter who have a 21st-century agenda on discrimination and flexibility had shares which, on average, over a five-year period from 1993, had risen by 141%, compared with the FTSE average of 78%. In spite of this, the pay gap has shifted little since the 80s. It stands at 18% for full-time female employees but a whopping 39% for 5m part-timers. Much attention is paid to the half a million working women (out of 12m) who pay tax at the top whack but, on average, a full-time man earns \u00a321,877, a woman \u00a315,438. \"As a society,\" Mellor says, \"we've accepted equality as part of the wallpaper. But in truth we've stagnated.\" Class, race and qualifications divide women but they have discrimination in common. The middle skilled childless woman has a lifetime earnings gap of \u00a3241,000 compared with her male colleague. A mother of two pays an extra penalty of \u00a3140,000. If a woman takes a year out to have a family, she returns to a job paying 16% less. Research published by the EOC last week revealed that many employers are complacent about pay. Only one in five has adopted the EOC's voluntary code of practice; only 35% have taken a pay audit. Secrecy hides the crime. Gail Cartmail is equality officer for MSF, a union with 400,000 members, a third of them female. It has just launched an equal pay strategy and what it has already learned about pay scales, Cartmail says, has \"proved a bit of a shock\". Among underwriters and brokers, for instance, full-time women earn 56p for every \u00a31 earned by a man. \"Confidentiality is a requirement of some jobs but we want everybody talking about pay,\" she says. Unequal pay is about cash, job segregation, the low value attached to caring, the part-time penalty, the attitudes of managers and a female tendency to undersell ourselves. As part of its Valuing Women campaign, the EOC demonstrated how prejudice remains alive and well among line managers. Some still see women as less ambitious and committed, so they deny them bonus-related pay. The problem is not helped by the weakness in the Sex Discrimination and Equal Pay Acts - it took 14 years for speech therapists to win \u00a312m in back pay. Next month, the EOC's Equal Pay Task Force will publish its report. It might advise stronger legislation; compulsory pay audits and contract compliance. What is also required is class action and the clout to demand profound structural change. Mellor would like a duty placed on the public sector to eradicate discrimination. Heather Wakefield of Unison says local government faces \"a massive equal pay problem\", exacerbated by the consequences of privatisation. The average salary is \u00a315,000, the average age 43; seven out of 10 employees are women and they are expressing their frustration with their feet. Equality and flexibility must be part of the solution. Local authorities say they are unable to fund the the pay gap and Wakefield says the government must. \"If it eliminated discrimination, it would reduce the national pay gap and set the private sector an example.\" Unison's aim at branch level is Educate, Negotiate, Litigate. Of course, in the long term, a critical mass of women entering the workforce is bound to have an impact. In 1970, they represented a third, now they represent half. In 1975, only 35% of higher education students were female; now that figure is 55%. In December, employment minister Tessa Jowell gave a thoughtful speech in which she emphasised the need to tackle gender stereotyping in schools, to offer retraining, to use citizenship lessons to tackle boys' attitudes to caring and to listen to equal pay recommendations. The government also intends to extend parental rights. Much more is needed. Twenty-five years ago, equality and space for commitments outside paid work were considered the business of bolshie women. Now, at least, they are recognised as the concern of both sexes and issues at the heart of society."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
