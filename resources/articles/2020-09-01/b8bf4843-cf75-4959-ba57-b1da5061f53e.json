I have been mentioned in connection with England before but to actually speak to the manager was something I wasn\u2019t expecting right at that time. I didn\u2019t know what to say at first, but it was a massive moment for me to join up with the England camp. I feel very honoured to be here. I\u2019m still being surprised by the tempo of the training, I can\u2019t believe how fast it is, but I\u2019ll get used to it. I\u2019m always up for a challenge.\u201d Phillips has already proved that at club level by successfully converting into a specialist defensive midfielder at Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s request. \u201cI was a bit shocked when he first asked me to do that, because I saw myself as a box-to-box midfielder who scored a few goals,\u201d he explains. Bielsa wanted him as a one-man defensive screen, the deepest lying midfielder in a 4-1-4-1 formation. It took him a while, but Phillips has adapted to his new role and is now frequently described as his club\u2019s stand-out performer. While his billing as the Yorkshire Pirlo may be a tad tongue in cheek it does emphasise his passing ability and the effectiveness of the switch Bielsa suggested. \u201cI was never going to say no to a manager like ours, but it was six or seven months before I properly understood where to stand on the pitch and how to read situations,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was difficult at first, but we both stuck with it and it seems to have worked.\u201d Since Phillips has received his international call-up playing in that position, Bielsa deserves some credit for giving Southgate and England another defensive midfield option, though the player, an unused sub against Iceland, is not sure internationals are the first thing on his manager\u2019s mind right now. \u201cI think he will be pulling his hair out because a few of the lads have joined up with national teams and he wants to prepare for the game against Liverpool,\u201d Phillips says of next Saturday\u2019s Premier League opener. \u201cHe puts a lot into his preparation, as you have probably heard, but it\u2019s mostly the trainers we work with. We don\u2019t really see him that much, and when he does have something to say or explain, he still uses an interpreter to get his message across. It sounds complicated but we are all used to it now and it seems to work. I\u2019m not convinced he still needs an interpreter, I\u2019m fairly sure his English is better than he lets on, but that\u2019s the way he likes to work and no one at Leeds is complaining.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
