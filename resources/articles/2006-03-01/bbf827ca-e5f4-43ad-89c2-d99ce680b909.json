Reputations can save you from ignominy, but the timing and tone of his now infamous memo was surely a little misguided. In the memo, leaked at the weekend, Pluthero said C&amp;W, which wants to halve its workforce, needed to stop being the Top Shop of its industry and become the Armani. The problem is that memos can be misconstrued, and this can have devastating effects on a business - especially if it appears to be taking an aggressive, one-sided stance. This appears like a wild swing from a second-row forward that would warrant a 10-minute sin-binning. There is no clarity over Pluthero's impending changes, which dominated this morning's headlines, and no clear reference to why the business has been struggling. When it comes down to it, there is little wrong with Pluthero's vision: C&amp;W needs a good kick up the backside and a clear indication of where it needs to go. But how it is going to get there is unclear. Swingeing job cuts implemented on the back of a succession of chief executives and amid strategic muddle hardly instil confidence. Clearly, there are challenges ahead. Pluthero has a good track record at Freeserve and Energis, but C&amp;W is a different animal. Its problems are more entrenched and have already beaten his predecessors, such as Graham Wallace. The integration with Energis, bought last year, has been slow and uncertain, perhaps hindered by C&amp;W's own lack of direction. The key for Pluthero and his team is in understanding what C&amp;W really wants to be. He talks of improving customer service, an area in which he thinks C&amp;W can take on BT. But there are other areas where C&amp;W can compete with BT and win (though this can only be done if Pluthero can pull everyone in the right direction). There is a huge opportunity for C&amp;W to beat an already struggling BT at delivering high bandwidth to businesses and homes - a target worth pursuing vigorously. There has also been a lot of speculation about whether the C&amp;W should ditch the ISP Bulldog as part of the reshuffle, but this would be crazy: Bulldog is crucial to any C&amp;W plan to own the channels that will deliver the content that is set to bombard us on every front. Microsoft and Apple, for example, have talked extensively about their plans for the home and for business. And if C&amp;W owns the network, it will have more lucrative revenue streams. Pluthero has an opportunity here to take the telecoms industry into a new era with C&amp;W at the helm, but he won't do this on his reputation and bullying tactics alone. Management has to be honest about its past failings, as well as clear in its vision. More importantly, it has to be clear about how it will deliver. No amount of memos can substitute for action. \u00b7 Paul MacGregor is managing director of PIPC UK, a project management consultancy working with Bulldog."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
