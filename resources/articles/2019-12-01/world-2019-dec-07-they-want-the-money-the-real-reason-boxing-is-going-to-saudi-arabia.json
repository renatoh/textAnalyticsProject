But Anthony Joshua\u2019s heavyweight fight against Andy Ruiz Jr is also rapidly becoming the most controversial. Joshua will earn a career-high fee of about \u00a360m when he faces Ruiz in the ancient Saudi Arabian city of Diriyah, on the outskirts of Riyadh, on Saturday. He insisted this week that the country was \u201ctrying to do a good job politically\u201d. However, human rights groups have reacted with horror and warned the British boxer he is being duped by a regime trying to \u201csportswash\u201d its international image. Felix Jakens, Amnesty International UK\u2019s head of campaigns, said that while they never expected Joshua to be an overnight expert, \u201cif you\u2019re fighting for big money in a country with a human rights record as bad as Saudi Arabia, then you\u2019d be well advised to counter criticism by speaking out about human rights issues\u201d. \u201cThe fight is pure sportswashing and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to challenge the Saudi propaganda machine and its increased use of sport to gloss over its abysmal human rights record.\u201d Jakens added: \u201cJoshua has a record of supporting charities here in Britain and we\u2019d hope he\u2019d be prepared to voice concern for people like the jailed Saudi women\u2019s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul.\u201d Hathloul was among at least a dozen women arrested last year as Saudi Arabia ended a ban on women driving cars, for which many of the detainees had long campaigned. The Saudi Arabian government says that hosting the \u201cClash on the Dunes\u201d \u2013 the first heavyweight title fight to be staged in the Middle East \u2013 is part of an initiative to get more people active, boost living standards, and open up the kingdom to tourists. Its sports minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki al-Saud, said \u201cno country is perfect\u201d but Saudi Arabia had made drastic reforms in the past two years, such as allowing women to drive and attend sporting events unaccompanied, as part of its \u201cVision 2030\u201d plans. Those plans include bringing sport worth billions of pounds to the kingdom, including Formula E motor racing, European Tour golf and the Spanish Super Cup football. \u201cWe want to host as many events as we can, to feed our strategy and promote diverse sports in the kingdom,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re showcasing that, hopefully, if we do bid for them one day, we can host an Olympics or a football World Cup. \u201cAround 70% of the population is between 15 and 40 years old. They see what is happening around the world through social media and they want to see it happening in the kingdom.\u201d But Jakens said the prince\u2019s remarks completely ignored \u201cthe ongoing human rights crackdown, with the jailing of peaceful activists and the near-total crushing of Saudi civil society\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s all well and good the Saudi sports minister smiling for the cameras ahead of a glitzy, multimillion-pound boxing match, but he must know that people are being arrested on a regular basis in Saudi Arabia simply for daring to voice criticism of his government.\u201d Joshua\u2019s promoter, Eddie Hearn, said the fight was just the start of things to come. \u201cThey want to make Saudi the home of boxing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis really feels like a really big moment where everything could change. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to be investing this kind of money in the sport, we\u2019ve got to be realists. Everyone\u2019s coming and they\u2019re all coming for one reason \u2013 they want the money.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
