Polish surgeons used nerve-supporting cells from the nose of Darek Fidyka, a Bulgarian man who was injured four years ago, to provide pathways along which the broken tissue was able to grow. The 38-year-old, who is believed to be the first person in the world to recover from complete severing of the spinal nerves, can now walk with a frame and has been able to resume an independent life, even to the extent of driving a car, while sensation has returned to his lower limbs. Professor Geoffrey Raisman, whose team at University College London\u2019s institute of neurology discovered the technique, said: \u201cWe believe that this procedure is the breakthrough which, as it is further developed, will result in a historic change in the currently hopeless outlook for people disabled by spinal cord injury.\u201d The surgery was performed by a Polish team led by one of the world\u2019s top spinal repair experts, Dr Pawel Tabakow, from Wroclaw Medical University, and involved transplanting olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) from the nose to the spinal cord. OECs assist the repair of damaged nerves that transmit smell messages by opening up pathways for them to the olfactory bulbs in the forebrain. Relocated to the spinal cord, they appear to enable the ends of severed nerve fibres to grow and join together \u2013 something that was previously thought to be impossible. While some patients with partial spinal injury have made remarkable recoveries, a complete break is generally assumed to be unrepairable. The research, funded by the Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation (NSIF) and the UK Stem Cell Foundation, features in a BBC Panorama programme on Tuesday night. Raisman, who hopes to see at least three more patients treated in Poland over the next three to five years if the funding can be raised, said: \u201cThe patient is now able to move around the hips and on the left side he\u2019s experienced considerable recovery of the leg muscles. \u201cHe can get around with a walker and he\u2019s been able to resume much of his original life, including driving a car. He\u2019s not dancing, but he\u2019s absolutely delighted,\u201d said Raisman. The NSIF\u2019s founder, David Nicholls, whose son Daniel was paralysed in 2003, said information relating to the breakthrough will be made available to other researchers around the world to help cure paralysis. He said: \u201cParalysis is something that most of us don\u2019t know very much about, because we are not affected by it. One of the most devastating moments a parent will ever experience is the sight of their son or daughter lying motionless in bed and facing the reality that they may never walk again. \u201cThe scientific information relating to this significant advancement will be made available to other researchers around the world so that together we can fight to finally find a cure for this condition which robs people of their lives.\u201d Raisman said he had never believed the \u201cobserved wisdom\u201d that the central nervous system cannot regenerate damaged connections. He added: \u201cNerve fibres are trying to regenerate all the time. But there are two problems \u2013 crash barriers, which are scars, and a great big hole in the road. \u201cIn order for the nerve fibres to express that ability they\u2019ve always had to repair themselves, first the scar has to be opened up, and then you have to provide a channel that will lead them where they need to go.\u201d He stressed that what had been achieved was a leap forward beyond promoting \u201cplasticity\u201d \u2013 the rewiring of remaining connections. The professor added: \u201cThe number of patients who are completely paralysed is enormous. There are millions of them in the world. \u201cIf we can convince the global neurosurgeon community that this works then it will develop very rapidly indeed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
