It's all very civilised at the moment - all that's missing is the sherry. Chelsea are in their usual blue strip with white trim, while Monaco sport red and white shirts halved into triangle shapes, with white shorts and socks. Chelsea's players are wearing blue socks. Game on. 1 min: Fernando Morientes is the first to get clattered, by Marcel Desailly in midfield. The Spaniard still has two thirds of his weekly wages paid by Real Madrid, the team that loaned him to Monaco only to be dumped out of the Champions League by them ... starring him. 3 mins: Not too much of interest going on early doors, but Monaco appeared to have settled better. Morientes has recovered, and a rash challenge on Hugo Ibarra by Wayne Bridge results in a free for Monaco on the halfway line. Not much comes of it. 5 mins: Some slick passing by Chelsea in midfield releases Frank Lampard down the left wing. He attempts to go around Hugo Ibarra but the Monaco right-back relieves him of the ball and hoofs clear. 6 mins: \"Based on your comments about the men in Royal Blue, Everton, I must ask the following: Are you a red sh**e?\" enquires Hakan Hansson, apropos my description of Everton as rubbish in the now-expunged pre-match team news. No Hakan - there's three bad teams in Liverpool and I don't follow any of them. Yourself? 8 mins: Throw-in for Monaco deep in Chelsea territory. It's crossed in to the edge of the Chelsea box and only a dubious offside decision prevents Dado Prso being put clean through with only Marco Ambrosio to beat. 9 mins: Claude Makelele makes an awful hash of trying to clear a Lucas Bernardi cross from the left. Ludovic Giuly pounces on it and shoots, but John Terry clears. Chelsea are in all sorts of bother at the moment. 12 mins: Given acres of room to manoeuvre on the right hand side of the Chelsea box, Dado Prso attempts to take the ball around Marcel Desailly. Instead of picking out Ludovic Giuly, who was free on the edge of the CHelsea box and screaming for the ball, the striker goes it alone. His feeble effort doesn't bother Marco Ambrosio one jot. 15 mins: \"I thought the game kicked off at 7.30 UK time? Nothing happened yet?\" writes Phil Newton, who should learn to read and/or tell the time before he tries to dazzle us with what passes for his wit. 16 mins: Monaco 1 - 0 Chelsea Dado Prso opens the scoring for Monaco. He reacted quickest to a bouncing free-kick in the Chelsea box, beating Hernan Crespo to it and heading it into the top left hand corner from about eight yards. Great reactions - Ambrosio had no chance in Chelsea's goal. 19 mins: Dado Prso crosses from the left wing, but Fernando Morientes free header is dire. The way things are unfolding here, Chelsea could get a hiding. 21 mins: Monaco 1 - 1 Chelsea Shows what I know, eh? Hernan Crespo equalises for Chelsea, giving them a big fat juicy away goal. Frank Lampard pulled it back from the right byline and found Eidur Gudjohnsen on the edge of the six-yard box. The Icelandic one promptly fell over, but skilfully contrived to poke the ball through a defender's legs to Crespo, unmarked about six feet away. He looked up, adjusted his feet and buried it. 25 mins: Fat Frank Lampard shoots from distance, but he shanks his daisy-cutter a couple of feet wide of Roma's left-hand post. 26 mins: Another brilliant chest-high cross from Frank Lampard pleads with Hernan Crespo to score his second with a diving header. Instead, the lank-haired chicken tries to shoe it in and puts it over the bar. 28 mins: It's all Chelsea at the moment and has been since I said they were going to get tonked. With Crespo lurking at the far post, Eidur Gudjohnsen balloons a dreadful cross over his head. A waste. Miss A.G. writes in to tell me she's working in an office where \"swearing or making jokes or being mysogynist or watching the match\" is frowned upon. I'd tell her to get a job here instead but (a) we're certainly not like that either and (b) em, she used to have a job here. 31 mins: \"Why do you feel the need to inform us of the the colour of both teams strips? Do you think it will help readers to follow your commentary? Why not go all the way and tell us which team is playing from right to left,\" asks Jason Murphy. Because Jason, that would be stupid. Which direction a team is playing depends entirely on your view of the match. 35 mins: A mistake by Desailly, who is not having one of his better games, lets in Ludovic Giuly. Despite last-ditch lunges from both Wayne Bridge and John Terry, he gets a shot in. His feeble effort from the edge of the six-yard box is smothered by Ambrosio in Chelsea's goal. 37 mins: Jerome Rothen crosses for Dado Prso on the edge of the Chelsea six-yard box. It's way too high and he gets a bollocking from his team-mate for his troubles. 38 mins: Chelsea win a free-kick on the edge of the Monaco box to the left of the D, after Lucas Bernardi handles. Eidur Gudjohnsen shoots straight into the Monaco wall. 41 mins: \"Well if you don't support Everton (as I do) or their ilk, where did you get that unsightly chip on your shoulder?\" writes Declan Keane. What unsightly chip would that be, Declan? I can assure you that you could hook me up to all sorts of heart moitors and machines, show me a picture of David Moyes or Goodison Park and nothing would happen. All I did was imply that they're rubbish, which they are. 45 mins: Half-time, with Chelsea finishing the better of the two sides after a very shaky start. Their defence is looking rather unstable, but Frank Lampard, Eidur Gudjohnsen and Hernan Crespo are noticably up for it tonight. Half-time entertainment: \"I suppose this will be another min by min epic without a single mention of the harrowing plight of the Ministermen,\" grumbles Rolf from Sweden, incorrectly, before going on (and on and on and on and on and on and on) to explain for the benefit of our American friends that the Ministermen are York City. 46 mins: Potentially great news for Monaco - Juan Seba Veron replaces Jesper Gronkjaer in the Chelsea line-up for the second half. He starts wide on the left for Chelsea and attempts to put Crespo through on goal with a good first touch. Offside. 47 mins: Jerome Rothen hoists a long ball up in the air and it comes back down to earth somewhere in the region of Fernando Morientes in the Chelsea box. Mario Melchiot misjudges the flight of the ball and has to work hard to retrieve possession. Moments later, Veron gets caught showboating for the first time and loses possession to Prso. 49 mins: After a spot of grappling in the Chelsea box, Fernando Morientes goes down after getting an elbow in the face from Marcel Desailly. The referee didn't see it. In the ensuing minutes, Chelsea almost concede two: Ambrosio saves brilliantly from a Dado Prso header, before Chelsea are forced to clear off the line from a Morientes scissors kick. 52 mins: After being antagonised by Claude Makelele, Andreas Zikos gently scuffs the back of his tormentor's head and gets a red card after the Chelsea midfielder went to ground as if he'd been shot. Makelele gets a yellow card for his part in the scuffle. Rather unjustly, Monaco are down to 10 men and Chelsea are not. The referee was conned by Makelele's histrionics. 56 mins: Eidur Gudjohnson misses an excellent scoring opportunity shortly after Monaco sacrifice striker Dado Prso and bring on Cisse to cover for Zikos in midfield. 60 mins: Things that happened while I was faffing around on the news wires trying to find out who had come on for Monaco, even though nobody really cares that it's Eduardo Cisse who used to play for West Ham: A big scramble in the Monaco six-yard box which saw no end of pushing, shoving and tripping go unnoticed by the referee, while Gael Givet almost poked the ball into his own goal. 62 mins: Chelsea substitution: Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink replaces Mario Mechiot. Chelsea are playing 4-3-3 now, with the new arrvial slotting in wide on the right. Isn't that where he ended up embarrassing himself when Ireland beat the Dutch in Lansdowne Road during the qualifiers for the last World Cup? 64 mins: \"Thank you for your 'reply' to my earlier question re the relevance of informing readers of the colours of both teams strips,\" writes Jason Murphy, who is like an irritating monkey chattering on a rock. \"The only problem is that it didnt address the question at all. Can I take if from this that you are unable to think of a reason?\" Hum, lets see Jason: The footballers are wearing coloured shirts. I'm here to tell you what the footballers are doing. Ergo, I tell you that the footballers are wearing coloured shirts. QED. 67 mins: Frank Lampard does well to win a corner off Hugo Ibarra down the left hand side. I'd elaborate, but Jason Murphy might consider my comments frivolous and we wouldn't want that. Then there's the Evertonians who might take offence ... you just can't be too careful. 69 mins: Robert Huth comes on in place of Scott Parker and goes in at the right-back berth vacated by Mario Melchiot earlier. The game has died something of a death since Andreas Zikos got sent off. Huth sends in a cross from the right, but Crespo can't get much of his head to it and his effort is feeble. 71 mins: John Terry gets booked for what looked like a nothing foul on Ludovic Giuly. The referee has made some strange decisions tonight. Chelsea are looking very scrappy at the moment - Claudio Ranieri has made too many changes and now they've lost their shape. 73 mins: Ludovic Giuly beats John Terry for pace and tries to latch on to a long ball played from the back. Marco Ambrosio hesitates before thundering off his line and just beats the zippy forward to the ball. 75 mins: Again, Ludovic Giuly almost scores. His cheeky attempt at chipping Ambrosio from close range goes over the bar. 77 mins Monaco 2 - 1 Chelsea Monaco attacked on the break immediately after Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink missed an easy chance to score with a header. From the halfway line, Fernando Morientes was sent on his way by Rothen with the ball at his feet. He galloped towards the goal, shook off the challenge of John Terry and shot high and right past Ambrosio. A great goal - 10-man Monaco lead. 81 mins: Monaco appear to have the scent of blood. Despite being down to 10 men, their opponants Chelsea are the ones who are in disarray. The tinkering for which Sky Sports news claim his name is a by-word could yet be their undoing. 83 mins: Monaco 3 - 1 Chelsea Unbelievable stuff. Shabani Nonda replaces Ludovic Giuly and scores with his very first touch of the ball. At the near post, he beat Terry to the bounce of a cross from the left-hand side and poked it past Ambrosio - who should have done better - from close range. 86 mins: Chelsea are an absolute mess. Half their players are making no effort whatsoever - Juan Veron keeps giving the ball away and John Terry is clearly crocked, but can't come off because Claudio Ranieri has used all his substitutes. It's remarkable - Chelsea looked home and hosed, now they're being hammered by 10 men. 90 mins: Monaco substitution: the excellent Jermoe Rothen makes way for Plasil. Monaco's players are just stroking the ball around for fun now, with the Chelsea players reduced to chasing shadows. This result is no more than Monaco deserve - their players have worked harder and looked hungrier all night. Full time: The referee blows for full time and Chelsea troop off with lots to do in the return leg at Stamford Bridge. If ever a match was lost on the sideline, it was this was one. It wasn't broke, but Claudio Ranieri decided to fix it anyway. Thanks for your time and emails.
