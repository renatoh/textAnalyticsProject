Because a wretched tackle in the opening minutes by the Leicester striker \u2013 too keen to impress would be the generous interpretation \u2013 risked inflicting serious damage on a player who has become quietly vital to the London club. As Vardy hurled himself studs-first into a challenge in the fifth minute and connected first with the ball but then with the left shin and right ankle of C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, the Spaniard screamed with pain and Chelsea fans watched with dismay. Vardy was lucky to not to be booked; Azpilicueta was fortunate not be injured. Everyone at Chelsea was just grateful that Azpilicueta was able to finish the match and return to Stamford Bridge fit and ready to continue playing a key role in the transformation of Antonio Conte\u2019s team, who go to Middlesbrough on Sunday in search of a sixth Premier League win in a row. In the past five league matches Azpilicueta has excelled in a new role for Chelsea. He spent most of the last two seasons as a left-back, performing with real elan there without quite reaching the heights of peak Ashley Cole. The signing of Marcos Alonso for \u00a323m in the summer was intended to provide a longer-term solution on that flank and allow Azpilicueta to resume playing as a right-back, which was the role Chelsea envisaged for him when signing him from Marseille in 2012 for \u00a36.5m, a fee that has since proved to be a bargain. Azpilicueta did fine at right-back in the early matches of this season but Chelsea, as a whole, were defective. The manager recognised the need to change the team\u2019s set-up, and one of the alterations involved assigning a new role to Azpilicueta. Since the game against Hull on 1 October he has been playing on the right-hand side of a three-man central defence. Chelsea\u2019s record since then reads: played five, won five, scored 16, conceded zero. Conte believes he has found Azpilicueta\u2019s best position. \u201cAzpi is a fantastic player because he can play different roles but I think the role that he\u2019s playing now is perfect for him,\u201d says the manager. \u201cHe\u2019s playing very well because he\u2019s fast, has good technique and he\u2019s a clever player. He can play in different roles but this role I think is perfect for him.\u201d Azpilicueta is quicker than the other two centre-backs, Gary Cahill and David Luiz, and has a defensive instinct that can only have been enhanced by having played all across the backline. And despite a mostly mellow demeanour he plays with an iron will. Azpiliceuta\u2019s excellence has been one of the reasons why Conte has not felt the need to try to wring more service out of John Terry in recent weeks nor rush Kurt Zouma back. Instead the 22-year-old Frenchman will continue his comeback from knee ligament damage by playing for Chelsea\u2019s Under-23s on Monday. No wonder Conte sees no reason to test Azpilicueta\u2019s versatility anew, especially with Victor Moses thriving at right wing-back. Conte admits he has been pleasantly surprised by how quickly his players have adapted to the new system, which he felt compelled to introduce after the 3-0 drubbing at Arsenal at the end of September. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same to play with four defenders and to play with three defenders,\u201d said the Italian. \u201cBut the first two weeks we worked a lot, above all the first week because we changed it after Arsenal, before Hull City. Then there was the international break. Then we started to work very hard to find the right line of passes with the ball and to find the right situation defensively. But yes, I\u2019m surprised at the speed to understand this new change.\u201d If Azpilicueta\u2019s role in Chelsea\u2019s improvement has been relatively unheralded outside Stamford Bridge, there has been no overlooking the thrilling performances of several players farther forward, such as Diego Costa, Pedro and, in particular, Eden Hazard. The system change seems to have unlocked something within the Belgian, who in recent weeks has regained the form that made him the Premier League player of the year in 2015. \u201cI like to see my players always involved in the project, in the idea of football, when we are playing,\u201d said Conte. \u201cYou can see Eden is always involved in the game, not calm and off during the game. No, he always stays in the game and he\u2019s always a point of reference for his team-mates. \u201cWe have many players that can be decisive. It\u2019s important to put these players in the best condition for their talent and for me it\u2019s important to see that they put themselves, their talent, into the team.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
