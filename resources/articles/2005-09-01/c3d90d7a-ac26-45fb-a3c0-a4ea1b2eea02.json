The publisher of the Yorkshire Post has agreed to buy the Local Press Group, owner of the Belfast News Letter, for \u00a365m, and the Leinster Leader company, whose titles include the Offaly Express, for \u20ac138.6m (\u00a395m). Johnston Press turned its attention to Ireland this year after exhausting takeover possibilities in Britain. It made its first entry into the market in August with the \u00a3155m takeover of Scottish Radio Holdings' 35 titles. Tim Bowdler, chief executive of Johnston Press, said the Leinster Leader deal, at 17 times earnings, \"looks like a full price\" compared with valuations attached to British regional newspapers. He said the acquisition increased exposure to a newspaper advertising market in the Republic of Ireland that grew 15% in the year to August. By contrast, ad revenues at Johnston Press's British titles declined 0.8% in the first half and the slump is expected to continue for the rest of the year. Both deals are subject to regulatory clearance but Mr Bowdler said the group would be interested in more acquisitions in a market that is expected to consolidate further. \"We are an acquisitive firm and we will look at things as they come along. Expect us to be an active player,\" he said. The Local Press deal saw David Montgomery, former chief executive of the Mirror Group, earn \u00a33.3m from the sale of his 5% stake. Mr Montgomery and the company's largest shareholder, private equity group 3i, made a profit on a business they bought for \u00a346m in 2003. Local Press's leading title is the Belfast News Letter, a paper that caused controversy following its acquisition by 3i when it launched a \"proud to be Protestant\" campaign. Mr Bowdler said he was aware of the political sensibilities surrounding the deal: \"We are conscious of the importance of newspapers to local communities.\" The Local Press owns 12 titles published in Northern Ireland and the Republic with a total weekly circulation of 343,000. Last year it reported revenues of \u00a318.5m and an operating profit excluding exceptionals of \u00a34.9m, a rise of 54% over the previous year. The Leinster Leader, owned by 27 separate shareholders, reported revenues of \u20ac21.1m from its six weekly titles and one evening paper in the year to August, a rise of 15% on the same period last year. Crevan O'Grady, head of media at 3i, said consolidation could be a more drawn-out process than it has been in mainland Britain, where public companies such as Emap have offloaded regional portfolios and there are fewer private, family-owned businesses. He said 3i was pleased to get a significant return on a business it acquired in 2003 but was frustrated in attempts to use it as a springboard for further deals. \"We struggled to deliver in consolidating the small newspaper businesses,\" he said. \"People like to own a newspaper, they like to have that local influence and often the newspaper has been in the family for more than 100 years. The titles have more of a political role in Ireland and that makes it more difficult to sell them off.\" Explainer: Papers and politics The Northern Ireland newspaper market became even more competitive this year with a number of format changes and new launches. The largest nationalist title is the moderate-leaning Irish News, which has around 48,400 readers and relaunched itself this year as a tabloid - abandoning the mid-size \"Berliner\" format. This year also saw the launch of a pro-Sinn F\u00e9in title, the Daily Ireland, which sells an average of 10,000 copies. The Unionist community is represented by the Belfast News Letter, which has a circulation of 28,000 and is historically affiliated with the Democratic Unionist Party, now the largest Unionist political bloc in Northern Ireland. The Belfast Telegraph, owned by Dublin-based Independent News &amp; Media and a sister paper to the Independent, is the biggest seller and takes a moderate Unionist line, with a circulation of around 94,000. The political allegiances of titles can lead to rows that extend far beyond cover price or format battles. The Daily Ireland issued a libel writ against Irish government minister Michael McDowell this year after he alleged that the newspaper was funded by the IRA. The newspaper, whose managing director is a former Sinn F\u00e9in councillor, denied the allegations and accused the Irish government of attempting to \"criminalise\" supporters of Sinn F\u00e9in. Unionist politicians in the House of Commons also led protests against the Daily Ireland's application for government funding, which was rejected this year. The privately owned Irish News threatened legal action if the rival title received state aid. The sale of the Belfast Telegraph to a business domiciled in the Irish Republic aroused concern among Unionists when it was announced five years ago. Stephen Byers, then the trade secretary, waved the deal through after receiving assurances that the newspaper's editorial integrity would not be compromised."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
