The statement called for \u201cprotections for the rights of animals\u201d. The Stein campaign did not immediately reply to a request for elaboration on Sunday\u2019s tweet. Harambe, a 17-year-old silverback gorilla, was shot dead after grabbing a three-year-old boy who had climbed into its enclosure and dragging him through a moat. The episode has inspired a circus of online activity \u2013 Harambe is a meme \u2013 that grew so intense last week that the Cincinnati zoo asked people to stop talking about the incident. \u201cWe are not amused by the memes, petitions and signs about Harambe,\u201d director Thane Maynard said. \u201cOur zoo family is still healing and the constant mention of Harambe makes moving forward more difficult for us.\u201d This week, the zoo deactivated its social media accounts. Maynard\u2019s own Twitter account was previously hacked and filled with messages about Harambe. Stein and Harambe attracted an equal share of support, 2%, from likely Texas voters surveyed on their opinions of the presidential contest between 12 and 14 August by Public Policy Polling. A RealClearPolitics polling average has Stein\u2019s national support at 3.3%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
