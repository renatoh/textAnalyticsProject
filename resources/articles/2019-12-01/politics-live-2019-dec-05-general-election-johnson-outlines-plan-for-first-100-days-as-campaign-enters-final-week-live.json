Andrew Neil has urged Boris Johnson to commit to a BBC interview with him to face questions on why people have \u201cdeemed him to be untrustworthy\u201d. At the end of an interview with the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, Neil \u2013 who was Johnson\u2019s former boss at the Spectator \u2013 said: \u201cIt is not too late. We have an interview prepared. Oven-ready, as Mr Johnson likes to say. Johnson has also shunned a sit-down interview with ITV\u2019s Julie Etchingham. Four Brexit party MEPs have held a news conference to explain why they are leaving the party and urging people to vote Conservative. They are Annunziata Rees-Mogg (whose brother Jacob is a Conservative cabinet minister), Lance Forman, Lucy Harris and John Longworth. Johnson has insisted he will get a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year - but refused to give a \u201ccast-iron guarantee\u201d to that effect. In an interview this morning Sajid Javid, the chancellor, refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit happening at the end of 2020, although he said the prospect was \u201cextremely remote\u201d. Johnson has apologised \u201cfor any offence caused\u201d by his article describing Muslim women who wear a face-covering veil as looking like \u201cletterboxes\u201d and \u201cbank robbers\u201d. Scores of serving and former Labour officials have given sworn statements about antisemitism in the party as part of evidence submitted to the Equality and Human Rights Commission\u2019s investigation into the issue. Labour\u2019s Jon Ashworth pulled out of the final pre-election episode of BBC Question Time, after the programme was criticised for featuring an all-male panel. John McDonnell has disclosed that Labour will not negotiate with smaller parties in the event of a hung parliament next week. The shadow chancellor told The Financial Times: \u201cWe will implement our manifesto...no negotiation, no deal, no coalitions. \u201cWe\u2019ll roll out our programme and let\u2019s see if the Lib Dems vote against the real living wage at 10 an hour, let\u2019s see if the SNP vote against the proposals we brought forward for ending austerity.\u201d Business leaders are calling for a number of commitments from the next government to help firms deal with Brexit. The Institute of Directors said details on international trade must be a priority in the coming months. The group said companies should be given an \u201cadjustment period\u201d before any new relationship with the EU comes into effect. Meanwhile, analysis suggests that none of the main political parties have a properly evidence-based strategy to meet their ambitions on education policy. The Education Policy Institute (EPI), funded by the Nuffield Foundation, carried out an analysis of the manifesto education plans of the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens and the Brexit Party, assessing how their policies would affect England. Researchers found that although all parties have made bold pledges about reducing opportunity gaps and raising educational attainment, the policies in their manifestos are unlikely to deliver on these aspirations.

Conservative chairman James Cleverly speaking about the UK\u2019s EU membership on Question Time. More than 100 pro-EU groups have sent a letter to Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson asking her to back Labour in the Prime Minister\u2019s constituency. The letter promises that if the Lib Dems step back in Boris Johnson\u2019s constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in London, the grass roots groups will pile pressure on Labour to pull back in Esher and Walton in Surrey where Lib Dem candidate Monica Harding is up against Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. The 134 groups that have signed the \u201cBoot Out Boris\u201d letter \u201cwant to change the dynamics of the election\u201d. The letter to Swinson says: \u201cWe know we are asking you a lot to help Labour without any reason to think Jeremy Corbyn will return the favour. But if Johnson wins a majority, he\u2019ll drag us out of the EU. So we implore you to look to the national interest. \u201cWe also know you are already only running a paper candidate in Uxbridge. But we want you to go further and support Labour there. \u201cA similar letter is being sent to Corbyn asking Labour to support the Lib Dems in Esher and Walton, where you can bring down Dominic Raab. \u201cBut to be clear, we don\u2019t want you to wait for him to say yes. Time is terribly short, so we want you to take unilateral action.\u201d Boris Johnson has written to Jeremy Corbyn accusing him of a \u201csly\u201d plan to \u201cfiddle\u201d a second Brexit referendum. The prime minister has urged the Labour leader to reconsider his Brexit policy and his plan to give full voting rights to all UK residents with Johnson saying it would give two million EU nationals the vote in another referendum. Johnson said Corbyn\u2019s approach has \u201calready done serious harm to trust\u201d in politics, adding that cancelling the result of the 2016 referendum before it has been implemented would do more damage. Labour has said it will \u201cgive the people the final say\u201d on Brexit, that within three months of coming to power a Labour government would secure a \u201csensible deal\u201d, and within six months they will put that deal to a public vote alongside the option to remain. Cat Smith, Labour\u2019s shadow minister for voter engagement, said: \u201cThe Labour Party believes in democracy. We welcome securing a new and better Brexit deal, and putting it back to the people to have the final say. \u201cIf Boris Johnson had any confidence in his own deal, he would have let it be scrutinised by Parliament, and then put it back before the people for their verdict.\u201d Friday\u2019s Financial Times front page Nationalising UK energy companies would delay the UK\u2019s move towards a zero carbon future, according to the chief executive of Scottish Power. Keith Anderson said investment by the private sector had seen the cost of renewable energy fall over the last decade and that debates about nationalisation would only serve as a distraction from preventing a climate emergency. A Labour spokesman told the BBC Anderson\u2019s comments are \u201chardly surprising\u201d as they represent \u201cvested interests\u201d. A Labour government would set up a network of advisers based in Post Offices to support small businesses if the party wins the General Election. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said the new Business Development Agency would act as a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d offering advice, finance and large-scale government contracts, and is part of a \u201c20-point plan\u201d to support small businesses. Another Labour policy is to set up a Post Office bank, and a network of business advisers would operate out of larger Post Bank branches to give advice and guidance for local businesses on how to access support and finance. Labour is also planning a 250 billion UK national investment bank, and network of regional and national development banks, to give small businesses and the industries of the future the funding they need. The party also wants to give free full-fibre broadband to every business premises, scrap quarterly reporting for businesses with a turnover of under 85,000, and reform business rates. On the Labour proposals to support small businesses, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said: \u201cDespite what they claim, Labour are not on the side of small businesses. \u201cTheir plans to raise corporation tax and introduce a four-day week will hit businesses hard. \u201cSMEs don\u2019t need a new quango, they need certainty. All Corbyn\u2019s Labour will bring is higher taxes and uncertainty with no plan for Brexit and the chaos of two more referendums next year. \u201cOnly a majority Conservative government can provide the certainty businesses need, get Brexit done and bring costs down for SMEs by cutting business rates so that they can realise their potential.\u201d Liberal Democrat business spokesman Sam Gyimah said: \u201cSMEs up and down the country have made it abundantly clear that any form of Brexit - be it red or blue - will harm their ability to hire staff, make it more difficult to export to our closest partners and ratchet up the cost of doing business. \u201cSo while Labour wants to claim that it is on the side of small businesses, its support for Brexit means that ultimately these plans ring hollow. The simple fact is that you cannot be both pro-Brexit and pro-business. \u201cIt is only the Liberal Democrats who will stop Brexit and bring forward a bold vision to support small businesses in the UK, including by scrapping the outdated business rates regime.\u201d The Liberal Democrats have pledged funding for disadvantaged pre-school children will be tripled if they triumph in the General Election. The party said funding would be boosted for children aged three and four attending nurseries and other childcare providers. Introduced by the Lib Dems in 2015, the Early Years Pupil Premium (EYPP) gives childcare providers up to 302 extra a year for all disadvantaged children aged three and four they look after, the party said, adding that around 99,000 children a year benefitted from the extra funding. The Lib Dems said they would triple the EYPP to 1,000 per child, costing between 65 million and 70 million in 2024/25. It has also pledged to support families on low incomes by investing one billion a year in children\u2019s centres, improving the quality of staff in early years settings by requiring all providers to have a staff training programme, and providing 35 hours of free childcare from the day parents go back to work to the day their child starts school. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said: \u201cThe achievement gap between richer and poorer children can best be closed in the early years. \u201cBut under the Conservatives, it\u2019s widening. We cannot allow disadvantaged children to be left behind before they have even started school. \u201cLiberal Democrats will transform the lives of families with a massive expansion of free, high-quality childcare. \u201cAt the same time, we\u2019ll give nurseries more money dedicated to supporting children from the poorest families and children in care. \u201cBy investing in the early years, we can give every child a great start in life.\u201d Friday\u2019s Metro front page focusing on Andrew Neil\u2019s challenge to the prime minister Tomorrow\u2019s Telegraph splash Friday\u2019s Times front page focusing on the Brexit party Labour has complained to the BBC\u2019s director general, Tony Hall, accusing the broadcaster of \u201cslanted and biased\u201d election coverage. The party claims to have examples of where Labour\u2019s leadership and policies have faced \u201cmore negative treatment\u201d and \u201charsher scrutiny\u201d by the BBC compared to those of the Conservative Party. Labour\u2019s co-campaign coordinator Andrew Gwynne also raised concern about Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to be interviewed by BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil. A BBC spokesman said: \u201cThe BBC will continue to make its own independent editorial decisions, and is committed to reporting the election campaign fairly, impartially and without fear or favour.\u201d Here is the letter in full from Gwynne: \u201cI am writing to raise the Labour Party\u2019s serious concerns over the BBC\u2019s coverage of the General Election campaign, which we believe has repeatedly shown bias in its reporting of the Labour Party and its leadership, and demonstrated a worrying failure to meet the BBC\u2019s obligations to fairness and impartiality. \u201cThat bias has been reflected in the framing, content and balance of BBC reporting during the campaign. We have recorded numerous examples of more negative treatment, harsher scrutiny and slanted editorial comment about Labour\u2019s leadership, policies and record, as compared with those of the Conservative Party, and submitted them to the BBC. \u201cUp to this point, there has been no substantive response, even though the time to address the evidence of bias is fast running out. \u201cIn terms of balance and fairness, we have particular concerns over the Andrew Neil interviews. \u201cIt now appears that the BBC has accepted the Conservative breach of the debates programmes package, agreed with both parties, and allowed the Conservative leader to choose an alternative interviewer. \u201cDespite our concerns about Andrew Neil\u2019s well-known conservative political leanings, we agreed to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s participation on the clear understanding that Boris Johnson had agreed the same terms: namely, a four-programme debates package, including a Neil interview, designed with legal oversight to ensure fairness, balance and impartiality across the campaign period. \u201cInstead, the BBC allowed the Conservative leader to pick and choose a platform through which he believed he could present himself more favourably and without the same degree of accountability. \u201cThis clearly broke the agreement the Labour Party made with the BBC in good faith. \u201cBut despite raising this repeatedly with BBC editorial management, no proposal has been made to redress the imbalance that has been created. \u201cThis imbalance is compounded almost daily by the fact that a significant amount of BBC content, on TV, radio and online, including bulletins, commentary and newspaper reviews, draws on the content and political agenda of the Conservative Party-supporting press. \u201cThe BBC does not have a role as a protagonist in the General Election. \u201cIf the Conservatives are allowed to \u2018play\u2019 or manipulate the BBC, and this behaviour goes unchecked, then the corporation will have effectively been complicit in giving the Conservative Party an unfair electoral advantage. \u201cI would therefore urge you to ensure that this unfairness is urgently corrected, and that the Labour Party is treated fairly and even-handedly, in relation to the governing Conservative Party in particular, in what is left of this campaign. \u201cI attach our previous letter to your colleague Fran Unsworth, and an updated set of examples of your slanted and biased coverage of the campaign.\u201d Friday\u2019s Guardian front page Addressing a rally of party faithful in Birmingham about Labour\u2019s manifesto pledges, Jeremy Corbyn appeared to mimic a line of questioning he received on Andrew Neil\u2019s BBC show. Speaking to a room of 800-1,000 people, the Labour leader said: \u201cSo when people say to me, \u2018how are you going to pay for all this, Mr Corbyn?\u2019 \u201c\u2019How are you going to pay for it, Mr Corbyn? Come on, answer it, answer it, answer it!\u2019 he added, drawing laughs from the crowd. \u201c\u2019You\u2019ve got no answer for it, have you?\u201d\u2019 He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got our grey book and every single line of our manifesto has been read through, carefully, and fully costed.\u201d Corbyn also insisted there was \u201cno place whatsoever\u201d for anti-Semitism within Labour. He said: \u201cI remember when Enoch Powell was in the West Midlands, I remember the viciousness of that whole period. \u201cI simply say this: in our society, in our moment, there is no place whatsoever for anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or racism. \u201cSo in the last weeks of this election campaign, when everything will be thrown at us by those that are rich and powerful, we\u2019re going to be out there on every street, every town, every city, with our message. \u201cA message of hope, a message of inclusion, a message of a society that is based on the needs of all of us and of social justice for all.\u201d Donald Tusk, the former European Council president, told The Guardian the Brexit campaign is an example of \u201cthe unprecedented readiness to lie\u201d in modern politics. He said Brexit has been \u201cone of the most spectacular mistakes\u201d in the history of the EU and \u201cthe most painful and saddest experience\u201d of his time in office. Labour has complained to the BBC\u2019s director general, Tony Hall, accusing the broadcaster of \u201cslanted and biased\u201d election coverage. The party claims to have examples of where Labour\u2019s leadership and policies have faced \u201cmore negative treatment\u201d and \u201charsher scrutiny\u201d by the BBC compared to those of the Conservative Party. Labour\u2019s co-campaign coordinator Andrew Gwynne also raised concern about Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to be interviewed by BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil. Gwynne said the party agreed to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s interview with Neil based on the \u201cclear understanding\u201d that Johnson had agreed the same terms. \u201cInstead, the BBC allowed the Conservative leader to pick and choose a platform through which he believed he could present himself more favourably and without the same degree of accountability,\u201d Gwynne said in the letter. A BBC spokesman said: \u201cThe BBC will continue to make its own independent editorial decisions, and is committed to reporting the election campaign fairly, impartially and without fear or favour.\u201d At The Custard Factory, Jeremy Corbyn said he is \u201cinspired\u201d by the ambitions of the children he\u2019s met - but also saddened by the difficulties they and their \u201cstressed-out\u201d teachers have faced as they struggle with a \u201clack of funds\u201d. \u201cNone of this is necessary, none of this is right,\u201d he added. All of this is part of Labour\u2019s promotion of education proposals which include capping class sizes by recruiting 20,000 extra teachers. Nigel Farage has criticised the three MEPs who abandoned his Brexit party today seven days before polling day in an interview with Andrew Neil. Annunziata Rees-Mogg \u2013 sister of the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg \u2013 Lance Forman and Lucy Harris all resigned the whip to back Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. Ahead of Jeremy Corbyn taking the stage at the Labour rally in Birmingham, the singer Jamelia spoke about how her daughter almost died as a newborn but because of the NHS, she is alive. The television presenter said her daughter is nearly two and \u201call she wants for her birthday is a Labour government\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn is due to speak shortly at The Custard Factory in Birmingham. Andrew Neil said the prime minister tells us he has always been an opponent of austerity but we would ask him for evidence of that. In the final part of his monologue, he said: \u201cAnd we would want to know why an opponent of austerity would bake so much of it into their future spending plans. \u201cWe would ask why, as with the proposed increase in police numbers, so many of his promises only take us back to the future, back to where we were before austerity began. \u201cSocial care is an issue of growing concern. On the steps of Downing Street in July he said he\u2019d prepared a plan for social care. We\u2019d ask him why that plan is not in his manifesto. \u201cQuestions of trust. Questions we\u2019d like to put to Mr Johnson so you can hear his replies. But we can\u2019t, because he won\u2019t sit down with us. \u201cThere is no law, no supreme court ruling, that can force Mr Johnson to participate in a BBC leaders\u2019 interview. But the prime minister of our nation will, at times, have to stand up to President Trump, President Putin, President Xi of China. \u201cSo it was surely not expecting too much that he spend half an hour standing up to me.\u201d More from Andrew Neil on his intervention which came after his interview with Nigel Farage. He said: \u201cCan he be believed when he claims another 34 [hospitals] will be built in the five years after that? \u201cCan he be trusted to fund the NHS properly, when he used a cash figure of an extra \u00a334bn? \u201cAfter inflation, the additional money promised amounts to \u00a320bn. \u201cHe vows that the NHS will not be on the table with any trade talks with America. But he vowed to the DUP, his unionist allies in Northern Ireland, that there would never be a border down the Irish Sea. \u201cThat is as important to the DUP as the NHS is to the rest of us. It is a vow his Brexit deal would seem to break.\u201d Here is the full transcript of Andrew Neil\u2019s challenge to Boris Johnson to commit to an interview with him with just one week before polling day. Talking about his leader interviews, the veteran broadcaster said: \u201cThere is of course still one to be done - Boris Johnson, the prime minister. \u201cWe have been asking him for weeks now to give us a date, a time, a venue. As of now, none has been forthcoming. \u201cNo broadcaster can compel a politician to be interviewed. But leaders\u2019 interviews have been a key part of the BBC\u2019s prime-time election coverage for decades. \u201cWe do them on your behalf to scrutinise and hold to account those who would govern us. That is democracy.\u201d Neil added: \u201cWe\u2019ve always proceeded in good faith that the leaders would participate. And in every election they have. All of them. Until this one. \u201cIt is not too late. We have interview prepared. Oven-ready, as Mr Johnson likes to say. \u201cThe theme running through our questions is trust, and why at so many times in his career, in politics and journalism, critics and sometimes even those close to him have deemed him to be untrustworthy. \u201cIt is of course relevant to what he is promising us all now. \u201cCan he be trusted to deliver 50,000 more nurses? When almost 20,000 in his numbers are already working for the NHS. \u201cHe promises 40 new hospitals. But only six are scheduled to be built by 2025.\u201d Reaction to Andrew Neil issuing a direct challenge to Boris Johnson to face him one-on-one, and the prime minister yet to agree a date for the BBC interview. Jeremy Corbyn did not directly respond to the question over whether he would resign if Labour does not win next week\u2019s election. It comes after Lord Falconer called for him to resign if Labour are unsuccessful while Len McCluskey, from the Unite union, said Corbyn should remain. Corbyn told ITV: \u201cI am leading the party to win the election, I am utterly determined to win the election.\u201d At a Liberal Democrat campaign rally in Edinburgh, which featured a \u201ctopple Boris\u201d coconut shy, a \u201cSwinzone\u201d selfie area and rather unseasonal free ice cream, Jo Swinson told activists she was glad to be back in Scotland and attacked the government still sitting just down the road at the Holyrood parliament. \u201cThe SNP try to pretend that if you\u2019re against independence, you\u2019re somehow against Scotland. They are wrong,\u201d she told the audience, before taking the SNP government to task for their record on health, education and policing. \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough week for the SNP headline-wise, with the ongoing infections crisis at Glasgow\u2019s flagship hospital, poor results in the Pisa schools study, and the resignation of the chair of the Scottish Police Authority, Susan Deacon, as she criticised police accountability and governance as \u2018fundamentally flawed\u2019.\u201d To laughter, she added: \u201cBoris Johnson says he is committed to our family of nations. But we all know that he\u2019s never been much of a family man.\u201d Corbyn was asked by ITV what his stance on Brexit was. He responded: \u201cA credible leave option maintains credible trading relations with Europe, the sale and manufacture of goods, a customs agreement that protects the Good Friday agreement. \u201cWe would support either remain or leave with the economic relationship with Europe intact.\u201d The Labour leader added he would not support Scotland having a second referendum on independence. Corbyn has reiterated his apology over the antisemitism allegations that have engulfed his party. He told ITV: \u201cAntisemitism is a vile evil. I have spent my life campaigning against racism. \u201cWhere there has been a delay in processing [cases], I apologise to the people who suffered as a result of it.\u201d On safety and security following the London Bridge attack last week, Jeremy Corbyn told ITV \u201cwhat concerns me is automatic release\u201d for people convicted of serious offences. He added his priority is a \u201cproperly funded prison service and probation service\u201d which is able to intervene. In an interview with ITV\u2019s Tonight programme, Jeremy Corbyn responded to his standing in the opinion polls. He said: \u201cI never comment on opinion polls. \u201cI behave as leader of the party. Yes, I have had a lot of attacks from the media. \u201cI don\u2019t indulge in personal abuse.\u201d Andrew Neil has urged Boris Johnson to commit to a BBC interview with him to face questions on why people have \u201cdeemed him to be untrustworthy\u201d. At the end of an interview with the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, Neil \u2013 who was Johnson\u2019s former boss at the Spectator \u2013 said: \u201cIt is not too late. We have an interview prepared. Oven-ready, as Mr Johnson likes to say.\u201d Neil said Johnson was the only party leader who had not agreed to be interviewed, adding: \u201cWe have been asking him for weeks now to give us a date, time ... as of now none have been forthcoming. \u201cNo broadcaster can compel a politician to be interviewed but leaders\u2019 interviews have been a key part of the BBC\u2019s primetime election coverage for decades \u2026 to hold to account, on your behalf, those who would govern us. That is democracy. \u201cWe\u2019ve always proceeded in good faith that the leaders would participate and in every election they have - until this one.\u201d Talks between trade unions and the Department of Health to prevent industrial action have ended without agreement. Health workers in Northern Ireland have been taking part in action over pay and staffing levels. There has been strike action as well as work-to-rule across the week, causing thousands of operations and appointments to be cancelled. Negotiators from four trade unions which represent health workers and nurses held a three-hour meeting with the Department of Health in Belfast on Thursday. The Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, who met the unions before their talks with the department, welcomed its fresh offer. But speaking on behalf of the unions, Anne Speed from Unison said it was \u201cinsufficient\u201d. \u201cDespite the tweet from the secretary of state earlier this evening in the middle of discussions before the meeting concluded, our position is as follows: The department has presented a new position, trade unions have jointly agreed this remains insufficient and falls short of our members\u2019 requirements and mandate that they have given us,\u201d she said. \u201cIndustrial action continues and joint planned trade union action remains in place for December 18.\u201d Nigel Farage has criticised the MEPs who left the party today to campaign for Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. Farage said Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister to the Commons leader, Jacob, and one of those to walk out, was \u201cwrong\u201d to suggest the Brexit party could put Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union \u201cat risk\u201d by contesting Labour-held seats. He countered by arguing it was the Tories that were guilty of potentially splitting the leave vote, by contesting constituencies such as Doncaster, Barnsley and Hartlepool where voters were \u201cunlikely\u201d to go blue. Lance Forman and Lucy Harris also left the party while John Longworth lost the whip on Wednesday for criticising the party\u2019s election strategy. One of the big developments of the day has been three MEPs leaving the Brexit party and urging voters to back the Conservatives . One of them, Lucy Harris, said her decision was based on her belief that only Labour and the Tories could win next week\u2019s election. She told the BBC that Labour\u2019s policy to deliver a second EU referendum would mean making a decision between a \u201cbotched-up Brexit deal\u201d and remaining in the EU and that it was therefore \u201ctoo risky\u201d to do anything other than vote for Boris Johnson. Earlier, the Brexit Party leader, Nigel Farage, pointed to links between the three MEPs and the Conservatives. Boris Johnson has refused to accept that the overall tax burden would rise under Conservative manifesto plans - despite the fact that the party says so quite openly in its costings documents. He was confronted on the issue by reporters because overnight the Conservative party released a briefing saying that, if it won the election, a budget in February would \u201ccut taxes for hard-working families\u201d. When reporters put it to him that the overall tax burden is set to rise in the first Tory budget, according to CCHQ\u2019s own figures (mostly because a corporation tax cut has been abandoned, and that counts as a tax rise), Johnson claimed not to be aware of this. For example, he told the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg: We\u2019re cutting taxes on national insurance contributions and on business rates, and I\u2019m certainly not aware of the data you describe. We\u2019re cutting taxes. And in our first budget we propose to do more to cut taxes. It would have been reasonable to say there is a difference between personal taxes going down and the overall taxes going up. But he didn\u2019t, and instead he just implied the journalists were wrong. Later, the Conservative party had to issue what amounted to a clarification \u2013 always a sign that a media appearance has not gone smoothly. Johnson has refused to commit to doing an interview with Andrew Neil. Asked about this at his Q&amp;A, he did not say he would refuse to do the interview, but he gave the strong impression that it is never going to happen. This evening it has emerged that he definitely won\u2019t be doing a sit-down interview with ITV\u2019s Julie Etchingham either. Jeremy Corbyn has given interviews to both Neil and Etchingham \u2013 although both generated multiple negative headlines, which of course explains why Johnson is evading this level of scrutiny. Four Brexit party MEPs have held a news conference to explain why they are leaving the party and urging people to vote Conservative. They are Annunziata Rees-Mogg (whose brother Jacob is a Conservative cabinet minister), Lance Forman, Lucy Harris and John Longworth. They worry that by continuing to stand in Tory target seats, Nigel Farage\u2019s party could be helping Labour. Last month Farage said he would not put up candidates in 317 Tory-won seats because he was worried about a minority Labour government eventually cancelling Brexit, and the rebel \u201cgang of four\u201d argued that backing the Tories everywhere was the logical extension. Farage has rejected this, claiming there are seats where the Brexit party is actually helping the Tories by standing. Students of Farage\u2019s career will recall that the last party he led, Ukip, also ended up riven by splits. Johnson has insisted he will get a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year - but refused to give a \u201ccast-iron guarantee\u201d to that effect. In an interview this morning Sajid Javid, the chancellor, refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit happening at the end of 2020, although he said the prospect was \u201cextremely remote\u201d. Johnson has apologised \u201cfor any offence caused\u201d by his article describing Muslim women who wear a face-covering veil as looking like \u201cletterboxes\u201d and \u201cbank robbers\u201d. Scores of serving and former Labour officials have given sworn statements about antisemitism in the party as part of evidence submitted to the Equality and Human Rights Commission\u2019s investigation into the issue. Labour\u2019s Jon Ashworth has pulled out of the final pre-election episode of BBC Question Time, after the programme was criticised for featuring an all-male panel. That\u2019s all from me this evening. My colleague Nadeem Badshah is in charge of the blog now. There is a Jeremy Corbyn rally at 7pm. The Andrew Neil interview with Nigel Farage is going out at 7pm too. And Julie Etchingham\u2019s interview with Jeremy Corbyn is being broadcast at 7.30pm. My colleague Hilary Osborne has written a Factcheck piece on who is responsible for the increase in homelessness, following comments made by the chancellor, Sajid Javid. On Boris Johnson not appearing on the Tonight programme, a spokesman for ITV said: \u201cThe ITV News team making the Boris Johnson Tonight film made the original bid for the prime minister when the election was called. \u201cThey have contacted his press team on repeated occasions with times and dates offered to film an interview. \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s team have today confirmed he will not be taking part. \u201cThe programme will instead feature a profile of the prime minister using fresh interviews with other contributors and archive footage.\u201d My colleague Jim Waterson\u2019s reaction to the news that Boris Johnson will not be following suit and taking part in an interview with ITV News. ITV said: \u201cEvery other leader of Great Britain\u2019s main political parties that has been approached has done an interview for Tonight.\u201d The prime minister has faced mounting criticism of his refusal to be interviewed by Andrew Neil on the BBC. Nicola Sturgeon has said she believes tactical voting could be key to stopping Boris Johnson getting a majority and that \u201cpeople are thinking very carefully\u201d about how to vote. Scotland\u2019s first minister said she felt there may be more tactical voting at this general election than ever before as she urged voters to oust Conservative MPs in Scotland by voting for the Scottish National party. She said: \u201cThe way to escape that mess and to focus on building a better Scotland is to make sure that the Tories and Boris Johnson don\u2019t get that majority they\u2019re looking for. \u201cIn this election people are thinking very carefully, I think there will be potentially more tactical voting than we\u2019ve seen in previous general elections, and in Scotland if you want to vote tactically to stop the Tories, then the way to do that is to vote SNP - we\u2019re the challenger in all the Tory-held seats.\u201d More on the controversy over Boris Johnson taking a selfie with This Morning presenters Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby using a Huawei smartphone, despite security concerns around the Chinese company. Schofield has waded in on Twitter in response to criticism. Responding to fans who asked whether he had challenged Johnson over comments which some claim are Islamophobic, the host replied: \u201cYES!!\u201d Ofcom said it had received 31 complaints about the interview as of this afternoon. Earlier in the comments bagillt was asking for some more detail of what Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, said in his LBC phone-in this morning. Ever keen to oblige, here are some more quotes. Khan criticised Boris Johnson\u2019s response to the London Bridge terror attack, saying it was not the Tories\u2019 finest hour. There were two possible explanations for the Conservative response, he said: One is, is just shameless politicking? But two is, Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are going on the offensive because of some of the things they\u2019ve done in last nine years? Let me give you just a couple of examples. One, it was a Conservative government that removed the powers that judges had, for example, when there\u2019s a violent and serious offender, to give them an indeterminate sentence to protect the public. The government did this to reduce prison numbers, to save money. Secondly, it is the case that there is far less rehabilitation in prisons and far less supervision because of massive cuts made by a Conservative government. So, you can understand why a Tory standing to be the prime minister again wants to turn a defensive posture to an offensive one. But just pause and reflect how [the victims\u2019 families] are feeling. Just pause and reflect how the three people so seriously injured last week are feeling, to see people in positions of power and influence trying to seek political advantage out of this. On reflection, Boris Johnson and his team will think it wasn\u2019t their finest hour. He said Labour should have the \u201chumility\u201d to accept that Jewish people felt there was a genuine problem with antisemitism in the party. He said: I\u2019m meeting friends who are Jewish Londoners on a daily basis who feel we are a racist party and we\u2019ve got to accept that. We can\u2019t project an anti-Jeremy Corbyn or an anti-London animus towards somebody who feels we\u2019re antisemitic. They feel we\u2019re antisemitic and I accept that and I think we\u2019ve got to have the humility to realise that a small community in London \u2013 and the Jewish community is relatively small \u2013 feels really upset, feels really scared and feels really anxious. I think it\u2019s really important that we address that. He said Jeremy Corbyn had campaigned against racism all his life and had never been racist in the way Boris Johnson had. He said: I can point to things on the record that Boris Johnson has said about people of colour and people with different faiths: on the record, overtly, proudly, being paid for it. [Can] you point to examples where Jeremy Corbyn has said things on the record, in articles, in speeches, for a cheap joke, about people of colour or people of different faiths? The Conservatives received donations of more than \u00a33m in the third week of the general election campaign - far outstripping the other parties, PA Media reports. The Electoral Commission said the Tories reported donations of more than \u00a37,500 totalling \u00a33.59m in the week from 20-26 November. In contrast, Labour received \u00a3521,909, the Liberal Democrats \u00a3509,998 and the Brexit party received no donations over 7,500 at all. The Green party reported donations of \u00a3100,000, and the Alliance party of Northern Ireland \u00a315,000. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has criticised Boris Johnson for \u201cevading scrutiny\u201d in the general election campaign. At an event in South Queensferry she said: Boris Johnson has ducked and dived, evading scrutiny throughout this whole campaign and no wonder because everybody knows that if he gets his way he drags Scotland out of the EU against our will, out of the single market and the customs union, plunging us into the next round of Brexit chaos that could cost every person in our country \u00a31,600 and a process that could end with a no-deal Brexit later next year. She has also unveiled the Scottish National party battlebus. Given that \u201cStop Brexit\u201d is also a Lib Dem slogan, this is probably the design the Lib Dems should have chosen for their battlebus. (Instead the Lib Dems opted for an enormous picture of Jo Swinson, which was probably a mistake because she has turned out to be less of an asset than the party expected.) The Conservative party has put out a statement clarifying its position on taxes - ie, saying what Boris Johnson would have said in his Q&amp;A earlier if he had been more honest about the party\u2019s plans. (See 3.57pm.) A spokesman said: Our manifesto does not propose increasing taxes on UK resident companies and would not put up personal taxes for hard-working Brits. We have been very clear that we are pausing future corporation tax cuts, and will invest this money into our NHS. We will also introduce a surcharge on those buying UK property from abroad, increase the immigration health surcharge so everyone contributes to our NHS and put up taxes on plastic bags to help our environment. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s Q&amp;A in Matlock. Johnson refused to accept that the Conservative party\u2019s own costings show the overall tax burden will increase under their plans. (See 3.57pm.) He rejected claims that his pledge to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by 31 January was misleading because 2020 would be consumed by Brexit negotiations with the EU. This point was put to Johnson twice, but he refused to accept it. He said the situation would be different after January because the \u201cparliamentary wrangling and bitterness and feuding\u201d would be over. For a good explanation of why Johnson may be wrong, and why 2020 could end up being dominated again by news about a possible no-deal Brexit, do read this Twitter thread from the Economist\u2019s John Peet. It starts here. Johnson insisted he would get a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year, but refused to say he was giving a \u201ccast-iron guarantee\u201d to that effect. Asked if he would \u201cabsolutely promise\u201d to get a trade deal with the EU by the end of the transition period, Johnson said he thought he could. We already have a deal. And we can come out on January 31 in a state of perfect equilibrium and grace with the rest of the EU because we have a zero-tariff, zero-quota position now, and I\u2019ve absolutely no doubt at all that we\u2019ll be able to make sure that the EU protects its own interests and has a deal with us that ensures that continues for the future. If you say, \u2018can I absolutely guarantee that we\u2019ll get a deal\u2019, I think I can and I\u2019ll tell you why \u2013 look at what we achieved ... in three months with the new deal that I did. We did it and it\u2019s a great deal and it will take this country forward and I\u2019m very proud of it. But when he was asked if that was a \u201ccast-iron guarantee\u201d, Johnson said: \u201cThe possibility you allude to simply will not happen.\u201d Johnson refused to commit to doing an interview with Andrew Neil for the BBC. Asked about this, he said: I\u2019m the first prime minister to have done two, or about to do two one-on-one leadership debates, several hours\u2019 worth of phone-ins, endless press conferences and interviews with all sorts of BBC people called Andrew. And I will continue to submit to the interrogation of the media. He also said that his communications director, Lee Cain, was the person to speak to for details of his media appearances, but the tone of his answer implied that he did not want, or expect, to do the Neil interview. Johnson defended plans in the Conservative manifesto to pass a law restricting strikes on public transport. He said: I do think it\u2019s absurd that critical transport mass-transit systems should be capable of being put out of actions by strikes, and other countries around the world have minimum service requirements for public transport - and that\u2019s what I want to see. He said people would be \u201coutraged\u201d if Labour were to allow EU nationals to vote in a second Brexit referendum. He said: I think the whole proposal from the Labour party is bizarre. I think people will be outraged by the whole thing and ... to think that it is going to be rigged in some way by getting in millions more voters who\u2019d be very likely to vote one way rather than another, I think that would cause a great deal of public disquiet and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right way forward. Earlier I posted some Press Association copy about Boris Johnson taking a selfie with Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby after his appearance on ITV\u2019s This Morning. (See 1.56pm.) The Press Association has subsequently filed this addition. A Conservative spokesman subsequently denied the phone was the prime minister\u2019s. But on the show Willoughby said Johnson reappeared after his interview and \u201che whipped his phone out and he took a selfie\u201d to which Schofield replied: \u201cBut he didn\u2019t know he had to press the button \u2026\u201d The most awkward questions for Boris Johnson today came on the subject of tax. Overnight, the Conservatives briefed out a story about how they would hold a budget in February \u201cwhich will cut taxes for hard-working families\u201d and this morning the Daily Telegraph and the Times both splashed on stories about the Tories offering tax cuts. But the Tories have already published details of their tax plans, and they show that, although personal taxes would go down in their first budget, the overall tax burden would rise because they have cancelled a planned cut in corporation tax. (In budget terms, that counts as a tax rise.) Overall, the cuts and the increases for 2020-21 effectively balance out, but the tax increase total (\u00a33,320m) is bigger than the tax cut total (\u00a33,195m), making a net increase in the tax burden of \u00a35m. This is perfectly defensible. You can argue that the personal tax burden is not the same as the overall tax burden. You could also argue that a tax cut forgone is not the same as a tax rise (although economists will tell you that it is). But Johnson did not do either of these things. Instead, when asked about these figures, he claimed not to know what they were, and refused to accept that the overall tax burden would rise. The BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, first raised this point. She put it to Johnson that he was saying he would cut taxes in February, when overall his manifesto said taxes would go up. Johnson did not accept this. He said: I don\u2019t know what you are talking about ... We\u2019re cutting taxes on business rates, we\u2019re cutting national insurance contributions for everybody in the country, everybody paying NICs. When Kuenssberg pushed him on this again, saying that overall taxes would go up, he claimed not to recognise the data. He told her: We\u2019re cutting taxes on national insurance contributions and on business rates, and I\u2019m certainly not aware of the data you describe. We\u2019re cutting taxes. And in our first budget we propose to do more to cut taxes. Later Liz Bates from Channel 4 News made the same point, and asked Johnson why he was not willing to admit that taxes would go up when it said so in black and white in his manifesto. He replied: Because it\u2019s absolutely not right. We have got a manifesto that commits us to cutting national insurance contributions for everybody in the country. Here is the chart from the Tory manifesto costing document (pdf) showing the party\u2019s proposed tax cuts. And here is the chart from the same documents showing the proposed tax increases. In an article with the Sun about his daily routine during the campaign Johnson joked that, when he needed to relax at night, he resorted to \u201ca few quadratic equations\u201d. But you don\u2019t need to be able to do quadratic equations to know that \u00a33,320m is more than \u00a33,195m. Q: What will you say to a voter next year who says, \u2018You said Brexit would be over, but I keep hearing about it on the news.\u2019 Johnson says he does not accept that will happen. Q: Why won\u2019t you admit that taxes will go up under your plans? Johnson says his priority in his first budget will be cutting taxes, not raising them. That\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: If there were a second referendum next year, would it be right to give EU nationals the vote? Johnson says the Labour plan is bizarre. He says Jeremy Corbyn cannot find anyone in his shadow cabinet who would vote for the deal he will negotiate. And he says that trying to rig the referendum would be wrong. Q: Will you do an interview with Andrew Neil? Johnson says he would be \u201cvery happy do interviews with all manner of people\u201d. He says he has submitted himself to lots of interviews. He says he is the first PM to do two one-on-one debates. As for questions about the Neil interview, he says the questioner should ask his communications director, Lee Cain. Johnson refuses to commit to doing an interview with Andrew Neil. Q: We have not heard anything from Jacob Rees-Mogg during the campaign. Will he be in your cabinet? Johnson says questions like that come under the category of measuring up the curtains. He wants to focus on winning the election. Q: Do you want to ban strikes on public transport and the tube? Johnson says it is absurd that critical, mass transport systems can be put out of action by strikes. He wants to have minimum standards for them. That happens in other countries, he says. He says that idea is in the Tory manifesto. Q: Did the previous Tory governments cut too much? Johnson says he was running London at the time. He says the Tory government had a mess to sort out. He wants to invest. Q: So did it cut too much? Johnson says that is idle speculation. He says Labour would start with an economic crisis, not end with one. Q: Can you give a cast-iron guarantee that you will negotiate a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year? Johnson says the prospect of not having a deal won\u2019t arise, but he refuses to give a cast-iron guarantee. Q: You say today that you will present a budget in February that will cut tax. But overall your plans will raise tax. And you say you will get Brexit done. But the talks will still go on. How can people trust what you say? Johnson says he does not understand the first point. He is going to cut taxes, he says. And he says taking the UK out of the EU on 31 January will end the parliamentary wrangling. When pressed on the point about taxes, Johnson says he does not know what Laura Kuenssberg, who asked the question, was referring to. Johnson obviously missed these tweets from the Financial Times\u2019 economics editor, Chris Giles. Johnson gets presented with a scarf saying get Brexit done. Q: Can you guarantee that the NHS will not be vulnerable to other countries or outside bodies? Yes, says Johnson. He says his charge often comes up. But the NHS is a fantastic thing. He says he is building 40 new hospitals. They will be there in 10 years\u2019 time, as a result of the decisions he is taking. And he wants to have 50,000 more GP appointments. A healthier population will make for a happier, richer country, he says. Johnson is now taking questions, from workers first. He says he will take media questions later. A woman says she sent Johnson an email some time ago. She lives at the top of Matlock, where people want to build 400 homes on a flood plain. There have been floods there, she says. Why is this going ahead? Johnson says he has met a huge amount of people who suffered during the recent floods. \u201cWe have got to stop building on flood plains,\u201d she says. The government is investing in brownfield sites, he says. He says he will pass this on to Sarah Dines, the Tory candidate for Derbyshire Dales, so she can take this up with the planners. Q: When Brexit is over, are you going to pull the country back together? Yes, says Johnson. He says the wrangling in the country has got worse. But in the Conservative party people are coming together. If Brexit is delivered, people will come together, he says. He now tells an anecdote from his visit to the Red Bull Racing centre yesterday. He says he was told they had managed to reduce the engine size from 2.6 litres to something smaller. But the engines were more powerful. That leads him on to claiming that this parliament has been holding Britain back like a punctured tyre. Johnson is now doing his familiar riff about how remarkable exports are. But there is a new, or newish, joke. Britain is the only country to export music to the United States, he says. That\u2019s why they call it One Direction, he says. Boris Johnson says he is at the John Smedley factory. He says he has some John Smedley garments himself. He starts by explaining why he is having an election. Parliament is \u201cbroken down, jacknifed\u201d, he says. It is the standard stump speech ... Boris Johnson is holding a campaign event in Derbyshire. He is at a factory where he is due to take questions from workers. The former chancellor George Osborne and his former opposite number Ed Balls will reunite for ITV\u2019s election night coverage, the Press Association reports. Since leaving frontline politics Osborne is, among other things, now the editor of the London Evening Standard, while Balls transformed his public image as a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing in 2016. ITV has confirmed that the pair will join the former Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson, as well as the former Labour home secretary Alan Johnson. Andrew Neil has already recorded his interview with Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader. It will be shown on BBC One tonight. In a clip released in advance, Farage said the three MEPs who announced they were quitting today were all linked to the Tories. He said: One of them is a sister of a cabinet minister, another one has a boyfriend working for that cabinet minister \u2013 fact, and another one is a personal friend of Boris Johnson\u2019s. Farage was referring to Annunziata Rees-Mogg, Lucy Harris and Lance Forman respectively. Farage also claimed that Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal was unacceptable. He said: And I\u2019ll tell you something, Boris Johnson\u2019s deal unamended is unacceptable and I certainly stand by that. That is not what Farage implied when he announced last month that he would not be standing candidates in Tory-held seats. In its submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission inquiry into antisemitism in the Labour party (see 7.35am and 9.20am) the Jewish Labour Movement claims Jeremy Corbyn has made the party \u201ca welcoming refuge for antisemites\u201d. Corbyn was asked about this claim on a campaign visit to Peterborough earlier. He rejected it firmly. Asked about the allegation, he replied: I completely reject that. When I became leader of the party there were no processes in place to deal with antisemitism. We introduced an appeals procedure to deal with it and we introduced an education process, so that party members understood the hurt that can be caused by antisemitic remarks or antisemitic behaviour. I think we\u2019ve got processes in place that have improved it a great deal. I\u2019ve posted it already, but I will post it again because it is the most arresting picture of the day, and you could write an entire treatise about celebrity culture, daytime TV and the impartiality of the media on the basis of its implications: Boris Johnson posing for a selfie with Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby after his appearance on their programme, ITV\u2019s This Morning. But there is another issue thrown up by the picture too; Johnson is using a Huawei phone. This is from the Press Association. Boris Johnson has appeared on television using a Huawei smartphone, despite ongoing security concerns around the Chinese company. Following an interview on ITV\u2019s This Morning, the prime minister used what appeared to be a Huawei P20 \u2013 understood to be his own \u2013 to take a selfie with presenters Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby. Willoughby said Johnson reappeared after his interview on the programme and \u201che whipped his phone out\u201d in order to take the picture. The incident comes in the midst of a heated debate around the company and allegations of its close links to the Chinese state - critics have argued that Huawei\u2019s telecoms equipment could be used to spy on people in the west - something the company has always denied. It insists it abides by the laws of each country in which it operates. The US, which has placed trade restrictions on the firm, has previously suggested that future co-operation with other members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing partnership \u2013 the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand \u2013 could be jeopardised if the Chinese company was given a role in the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure. On Wednesday, Johnson said he would not compromise Britain\u2019s national security over whether to give the telecoms firm a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G network. The Conservative party refused to comment on the incident. Boris Johnson is due to hold a campaign event shortly. But, as the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg reports, there\u2019s been a problem. The academic Simon Usherwood has an interesting Twitter thread on the Brexit party resignations. It starts here. And here are some of his posts. Q: What would you say to Nigel Farage if he were here? Forman says he would invite Farage to join them, and to stand down his candidates. Q: In all but about 20 seats? Forman suggests it would be better to stand down everywhere. Sometimes you have to swallow your pride, he says. He says Farage could be seen as a great statesman if he were to do that. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Q: Do you feel Brexit party supporters are now lions led by donkeys? Longworth says he hates personal attacks. For him, this is all about Brexit. He says it is wrong that the Brexit party is now putting the party ahead of Brexit. Q: Do you think Nigel Farage\u2019s tactical decisions have jeopardised Brexit? Rees-Mogg says all four MEPs on the panel have raised concerns about Farage\u2019s strategy. She thinks he wants an independent UK. But she thinks he is going about it the wrong way, and risking the election of a remainer government. Q: The Brexit party response to your move has been vicious. (See 10.06am.) Have they always had their suspicions about the four of you? Longworth says he does not think so. He says the problem only started when Nigel Farage decided the party would oppose Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. It would have been better to work with Johnson on improving it, he says. He says he does not think a formal alliance with the Tories would have worked. But at this point he says he thinks, if you support Brexit, backing the Tories is the only option. Q: Will you stand down as MEPs? And will you work together as a group? Harris says they won\u2019t stand down. She says they want to be in the European parliament to vote for Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. The Brexit party will vote against it, she says. Q: [To Longworth] Did the Brexit party strip you of the whip yesterday because they knew you were going to do this? Longworth says he does not know. He says the Brexit party refused to tell him directly why the whip was being withdrawn. But he says he was in Brussels yesterday for an internal committee vote. He said he was not allowed to tell the Brexit party about what happened, and he thinks that may have been why he was disciplined. Q: You said you have not discussed this with the Tories. But have the Tories discussed this with you in the past? Longworth says he has never had any approach from the Conservative party. He says Nigel Farage keeps alleging this, but it is not true. Annunziata Rees-Mogg says she has had no offers from the Conservative party at all. She says she gets annoyed when people suggest she is acting on behalf of her brother. She isn\u2019t. I have had no approaches from the Conservative party in any description and I am, frankly, finding it really quite disturbingly old-fashioned that people are suggesting that my brother gets to tell me what to do with my political views \u2013 he doesn\u2019t. We have completely independent views from each other and I am only concerned about Brexit. I haven\u2019t spoken to anyone about it - they wouldn\u2019t be able to bribe me. This is purely, purely about Brexit. Harris and Lance Forman both say they have never had offers from the Tories either. The panel are now taking questions. Q: Have any of you been offered jobs or honours by the Tories? John Longworth says they have not even discussed this move with the Tories. Q: Are you planning to join the Conservatives? Lucy Harris says this is what they are saying for the moment. But, if invited to campaign for a Conservative candidate, she would. Annunziata Rees-Mogg MEP is speaking now. (This is one Rees-Mogg that CCHQ will be happy to see on the news. Her brother, Jacob, the leader of the Commons, has been invisible during the campaign since he suggested that the Grenfell Tower residents lacked the common sense to ignore the advice to stay put.) Rees-Mogg says she joined the Brexit party earlier this year, when it looked as if Theresa May was going to deny the country a proper Brexit. But the party\u2019s success ensured a Brexiter became Tory leader. When Boris Johnson unveiled his Brexit plan, the Brexit party immediately decided it was unacceptable. Rees-Mogg says that was a mistake. And she says the fact that the party is standing now in Tory target seats means it could split the Brexit vote, and let in Labour candidates. The Brexit party are now \u201cthe very party risking Brexit\u201d, she claims. John Longworth MEP is speaking at the press conference now. He says he was always a Eurosceptic. He recalls sitting on a government taskforce on deregulation when Margaret Thatcher was PM, and realising how resistant some government departments were to deregulation. He says he publicly came out in favour of Brexit during the referendum campaign. At the time he was the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. He says he was infuriated by the scaremongering coming from the remain campaign about the consequences of Brexit. He says he joined the Brexit party to ensure Brexit happened. He says if the Brexit party had not been formed, and won seats in the European elections, Theresa May and Philip Hammond would have pushed through a watered-down version of Brexit. He says, since then, the Brexit party has morphed into something else. It has non-Brexit goals. But Longworth says he is only interested in Brexit. He says Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal has \u201cthe potential to be a great deal\u201d. I would say it equates to being a little bit better than the Norway deal - but it has the potential to be a great deal. It is also \u201cthe only game in town\u201d, he says. All the alternatives would lead to article 50 being revoked. That is why he thinks people should vote Conservative in the election, even if they have to \u201chold their nose\u201d. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, was on LBC this morning. As LBC\u2019s Theo Usherwood reports, Khan said that Boris Johnson\u2019s record on racism was far worse than Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s on antisemitism - not least because Johnson has been paid for what he had said in his journalism. Lance Forman, the London MEP, is speaking at the press conference. He says, if it is acceptable for the Brexit party to stand down in 317 Tory-held seats, it makes sense for the Brexit party to back the Conservative party everywhere. He says his decision is not prompted by opposition to Nigel Farage. He pays tribute to Farage, saying he has achieved a huge amount. He also says he is worried about antisemitism in the Labour party. The four Brexit party MEPs who have left to back the Conservatives are now holding a press conference in Westminster. There is a live feed here. And this is from the Brexit party MEP Michael Heaver. These are from the Brexit party MEP Alexandra Phillips on the four defectors. Here is the video message from the Brexit party\u2019s \u201cgang of four\u201d explaining why they are now backing the Conservatives. This is from Lucy Harris, one of the four Brexit party MEPs who has left the party to support the Conservatives. One measure of the dismal state of our politics is the way political interviewing at this election seems to consist mostly of demanding apologies. With Jeremy Corbyn, it\u2019s for antisemitism. With Jo Swinson, it\u2019s for her record in coalition. And with Boris Johnson - well, there is quite a choice, but racist, homophobic or otherwise offensive comments made by him in newspaper columns tend to come at the top of the list. (Note to younger readers: election campaigns didn\u2019t always used to be like this.) Johnson was on ITV\u2019s This Morning a few minutes ago. Two days ago the presenter Phillip Schofield managed to get an apology out of Corbyn. Today he managed the same with Johnson. Here are the main points. Johnson apologised for describing women wearing burqas as looking like letterboxes. Unlike many of the other comments in previous newspaper articles for which he is being criticised, Johnson wrote this relatively recently, in the summer last year. Asked whether he would say sorry for the offence caused, he replied: I have already said sorry for any offence that I\u2019ve caused, and I say it again. Johnson has not always been willing to apologise for these comments. When Fiona Bruce asked him to apologise for these comments in the BBC Question Time leaders\u2019 special two weeks ago, he refused. But on Friday last week, in a phone-in on LBC, Johnson did issued a generalised apology. Asked about Islamophobia in the Conservative party, he said: I apologise ... Many people who will point out I have said things that have caused offence. Well, I\u2019m deeply sorry for the offence that I caused. Johnson said claims that the NHS would be on the table in trade talks with the US was as implausible as stories about UFOs. When it was put to him that there was a dossier showing the NHS had been discussed in talks, he replied: And there are photographs that purport to prove there are UFOs. But it is complete nonsense. Asked to give a \u201crock-solid guarantee\u201d that no part of the NHS would be sold off, Johnson said he could, repeating the words \u201crock-solid guarantee\u201d. Johnson said he could promise that Brexit would happen on 31 January if he won a majority. On ITV\u2019s This Morning Holly Willoughby asks about crime and safety. A lot of people feel unsafe, she says. Boris Johnson says he massively reduced crime when he was mayor of London. He says that Usman Khan, the London Bridge attacker, had to be released. It is always worth trying to rehabilitate people, he says. But there are some people incapable of changing, and Khan was probably one of them, he says. Q: Does it help for a PM to use terms like bank robber and letterbox to describe women who wear the burqa? Johnson says he has already said sorry for any offence caused, and he says it again. Johnson apologises for any offence caused by his article comparing women wearing burqas to letterboxes. He says it is worth looking at what the article using those words said. He is proud of his Muslim ancestry, he says. He says he will have an inquiry into prejudice and xenophobia of all kinds. Q: You also branded single mothers as irresponsible, and working-class men as feckless, in an article in 1995? Johnson says this is not the time to talk about any offence given by an article written a long time ago. Boris Johnson is giving an interview to ITV\u2019s This Morning. He says he loves the NHS. He can give an absolute guarantee that no part of the NHS will be sold off, he says. Phillip Schofield puts it to him that companies part-owned by Americans already play a big role in providing NHS services. Johnson says this was a process that happened under Labour, when contracts were outsourced. According to the Press Association, the other two Brexit MEPs who are resigning are Lance Forman and Lucy Harris. Forman is an MEP for London and runs a smoked salmon business. And Harris is an MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber, and an opera singer. And Press Association also quotes the MEP Annunziata Rees-Mogg explaining her decision to leave the Brexit party. She said: We need a strong leave-supporting government to deliver the Brexit 17.4m voted for. The Conservatives are the only option for Brexit supporters and democrats alike. The defection of four Brexit party MEPs (see 9.47am) still has not been formally announced, but the Brexit party itself has issued a response. It says three of its MEPs are resigning the whip. It says John Longworth already had the whip removed yesterday. In a statement Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, said: Whilst we are disappointed that four of our MEPs don\u2019t seem to understand that we both saved the Conservative party from large-scale losses to the Liberal Democrats in the south and south-west of England but we are also hammering the Labour leave vote in its traditional heartlands, making it much easier for the Conservatives to win many of those seats. The only vote on the leave side that is currently being split is in areas such as Barnsley, the South Wales Valleys, Doncaster and Hartlepool, where there is a risk that the Tories will split our vote. As proof of his claim that the Brexit party will make it easier for the Tories to win Labour seats in leave-voting areas, Farage cited the Survation poll for the Economist two weeks ago, which shows the Tories on course to win the previously safe Labour seat of Great Grimsby ostensibly because the Labour vote has collapsed by 18 points, which is almost exactly what the Brexit party is polling in the constituency. In the statement, a Brexit party spokesman added: We also note that one of the MEPs is the sister of a cabinet minister, another has a partner who works in the office of the same cabinet minister and yet another is a personal friend of both Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. In the case of John Longworth, who was for years the firmest advocate of WTO withdrawal that we have ever met, he underwent a metamorphosis into being a supporter of the new EU treaty following two days of meetings in London. We hope that Mr Longworth is well rewarded for his actions. That means Annunziata Rees-Mogg is expected to defect; her brother Jacob is the leader of the Commons. According to a report by David Wooding for the Sun, four Brexit party MEPs will today announce that they are quitting their party and urging people to vote Conservative instead. One of them is John Longworth, the former director general of the British Chambers of Commerce and former Leave Means Leave chairman who yesterday had the whip removed because he had publicly criticised the election strategy being pursued by Nigel Farage, the party leader. In his report, which Brexit party sources are not denying, Wooding says Longworth and his colleagues fear that the Farage strategy could be putting Brexit at risk. He writes: Mr Longworth was unavailable for comment last night but an insider said: \u2018We can\u2019t support a party that jeopardises Brexit. \u2018Too many people are concerned about their own egos rather than the cause we have all been campaigning for: to leave the EU. \u2018It has become increasingly clear that unless the Tories win next week, Brexit is doomed. But some of our team are so wrapped up in their own self-interest they can\u2019t see that.\u2019 Wooding says the split follows weeks of infighting among the Brexit party\u2019s MEPs. The walkout follows weeks of vicious infighting among the Brexit party group in the European parliament. It was described by one as \u2018a toxic battle between the old Ukippers and the old Tories\u2019. Tempers became even more frayed in October when the party hierarchy decided to oppose Boris Johnson\u2019s deal \u2013 within minutes of it being announced. The Brexit party, which was only properly launched this year, won 29 seats in the European election, making it the biggest single party represented in the European parliament. It triumphed because Theresa May\u2019s failure to pass a Brexit deal, and her decision to accept a Brexit extension, made it hard for Brexiters to vote for the Tories. But at this election the Brexit vote has swung back to the Conservatives, a process that has been encourage by Farage effectively endorsing Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal and refusing to stand candidates in Tory-held seats. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. Here is a link to the Jewish Labour Movement submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission inquiry into antisemitism in the Labour party mentioned earlier. (See 7.35am.) A member of the Scottish National party\u2019s conduct committee, who was due to rule on antisemitism allegations against its former candidate in Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, has herself resigned from the party after being challenged over alleged antisemitism. Denise Findlay, an SNP activist who tweets as @GraceBrodie, said she had resigned yesterday after SNP officials confronted her over her stance on Israel, shortly before a Channel 4 News report on her tweets. In a tweet saying she had resigned, she said: \u201cThere are tweets where I\u2019m arguing that Israel=Nazi should not be part of the definition of anti-semitism.\u201d That tweet no longer appears in her timeline but she later confirmed on Twitter that was the topic. Findlay was a prominent supporter of Neale Hanvey, a former leader of the SNP group on Fife council who was sacked as the party\u2019s candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath late last month after two allegedly antisemitic posts came to light. Hanvey\u2019s membership was also suspended; Findlay had been elected to join the conduct committee which would rule on his membership in October. Hanvey is still contesting the seat, running as an independent, with many local members ignoring Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s demand that they campaign for the SNP in other seats. Findlay has been backing his decision to continue campaigning, and donated to his election crowdfunding appeal. The controversy, which has divided the party in Fife, increases the chances of Labour retaining the seat. It is being defended by Lesley Laird, a Corbyn ally who is Labour\u2019s shadow Scottish secretary. Labour is averaging 18% in the polls in Scotland and, until this split, Hanvey was widely tipped to win the seat. In a statement on Wednesday night, the SNP said: There is no place for antisemitism in Scotland or in the SNP. All political parties have a duty to show leadership, and we will always take tough action in order to reassure the Jewish community that these matters are taken seriously. When challenged on her actions, Denise Findlay resigned from the SNP. The views she expressed are entirely at odds with the ethos of this party. Findlay apologised in a statement to the Courier newspaper in Dundee: When I tweeted about Israel and compared them to Nazis, I did not know that was antisemitic. I am profusely sorry and I now fully understand that what I said was hurtful to the Jewish community. I still believe you should be able to criticise the Israeli government for their actions in Palestine. I am not a politician and was not aware of the IHRA definition. I do know now and realise I made a mistake. I am really sorry. Here\u2019s some reaction to Javid\u2019s remarks on the prospects of a free trade deal by the end of next year. The chancellor has also refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit at the end of next year. Javid was repeatedly asked on the Today programme whether there was a chance of the UK leaving the EU with no deal at the end of 2020. He said the chances of the that were \u201cextremely remote\u201d but dodged several opportunities to rule it out. He claimed that outline of a free trade agreement had already been worked out. He said: By the end of 2020, we will have agreed and finalised the trade deal, a very ambitious, deep, comprehensive free trade agreement. And we will get that done also by the end of 2020. In the time that we\u2019ve been negotiating over the last 100 days or so, it wasn\u2019t just the exit agreement ... we are also negotiated and worked and agreed the outline of the ambitious free trade agreement. There is no a single doubt in my mind that it can be agreed within months, and we can get it through parliament by 2020. Asked what tariffs the car industry would pay under such a deal, Javid said: Because it\u2019s a deep, comprehensive free trade agreement, it\u2019s zero tariffs, zero quotas, not just for the car industry, an agreement on services, having equivalents on financial services. We\u2019ve set all this out. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, claims that Boris Johnson could still do that interview with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil. Speaking in a round of broadcast interviews on his 50th birthday, Javid told Sky News that \u201cnegotiations are still ongoing\u201d. Neil\u2019s head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn created days of negative headlines for Labour over antisemitism and funding for Labour\u2019s spending plans. Corbyn\u2019s team are furious that Johnson appears to be trying to avoid being put under similar scrutiny, insisting they were assured the prime minister had signed up for a similar interview before agreeing to put up their candidate. A lawyer representing the Jewish Labour Movement has accused Labour of not fully investigating all cases of antisemitism within the party. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, James Libson, a partner at the Mishcon de Reya law firm, said he had prepared 70 sworn testimonies from Labour party staffers past and present as part of evidence submitted to the Equality and Human Rights Commission\u2019s investigation into allegations of antisemitism in the party. Libson, when asked whether the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s assertion that every case of antisemitism had been dealt with was incorrect, said: \u201cVery much so.\u201d He added: There are many, many outstanding complaints, many examples of interference and many examples of double-standards in the way in which complaints are processed. Asked whether there was evidence that the Labour leader\u2019s office was \u201cinterfering\u201d in the investigations process, Libson said: There has been interference and that interference has unfortunately become institutional. Institutional in the sense that people affiliated with the leader\u2019s office \u2013 and now in the actual unit that are investigating \u2013 and that at a more basic level, information is passing between the leader\u2019s office and investigating unit. He added: \u201cPassed by USB sticks, by WhatsApp groups, secret WhatsApp groups.\u201d The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, said Labour had \u201ctoughened up\u201d its approach to tackling antisemitism. He told Today: Having been too slow and too weak at the start, the action being taken now has been toughened up. An in-house lawyer, special appeal panels to deal with complaints, new fast-track expulsion powers that are being used. I\u2019m confident that cases coming in are being dealt with and if they are coming in they will be dealt with.\u201d Healey apologised to the Jewish community who he said \u201cfeel let down\u201d by the way Labour has handled cases of antisemitism in the party. The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, has tried to get Jeremy Corbyn out of a hole with royalists, by suggesting he may watch the Queen\u2019s speech on catchup. Corbyn appeared to be caught out by ITV\u2019s Julie Etchingham when asked whether he watched the Queen\u2019s Christmas broadcast. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s on in the morning, usually we have it on some of the time.\u201d The speech is broadcast at 3pm. Challenged about the apparent gaffe, which made the front page of the Daily Express (see below), Rayner told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean to say he watches it on Christmas Day. He said he watched it in the morning. He said he also visits a homeless shelter.\u201d Asked whether Corbyn meant he watched the speech on Boxing Day, Rayner said: I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not with Jeremy Corbyn on Christmas Day. What I\u2019m saying is from my own experience sometimes I watch programmes on catchup, sometimes on the time it\u2019s at. Most kids, including my kids, watch [programmes] on YouTube. So it can be confusing about which times people watch something. You don\u2019t have to watch it at the time that is specified in the TV guide. Asked whether she would be watching the Queen\u2019s speech, Rayner said: \u201cI always do. My kids are named after kings and so I\u2019ve got James and Charles.\u201d What the papers said Joe Biden\u2019s team clearly loved the footage that appeared to show world leaders laughing at Trump. The day ahead Boris Johnson will head to the Midlands, where he will have a tour of a mill shop and inspect some knitwear. Jeremy Corbyn will also be in the Midlands, where he will visit several schools before hosting a rally in the evening. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, will visit a care home in Edinburgh before appearing at a rally alongside colleagues from the Scottish section of the party. It\u2019s Nigel Farage\u2019s turn to face off against Andrew Neil. The interview will be broadcast at 7.30pm. Good morning everyone, it\u2019s a week until election day. After the brief but amusing distraction that was Nato, all attention is back on to the vote and Boris Johnson will resume campaigning today. Johnson survived the summit relatively unscathed. There had been concerns in the Conservative camp that Johnson\u2019s proximity to the US president might be damaging, stoking voter fears that the NHS might be on the table in US-UK trade deals. But the prime minister managed to avoid almost any public meetings with Trump, though he was caught on camera apparently joking about Trump with other world leaders, something Johnson astonishingly has no memory of. After the video of the interaction did the rounds, Trump called Justin Trudeau \u201ctwo-faced\u201d and then announced he was leaving early and would not be giving a press conference. Don\u2019t miss Marina Hyde\u2019s or John Crace\u2019s take on yesterday\u2019s events. Now that all the Nato shenanigans are out of the way, normal programming can resume. Johnson has launched his plans for the first 100 days after he takes office if he wins on 12 December. He says his main focus would be passing the withdrawal agreement to ensure Brexit happens on 31 January. Other priorities include bringing in legislation to end the automatic release of serious violent and sexual offenders at the halfway point of their sentence \u2013 which the family of murdered student Jack Merritt have condemned as a kneejerk politicisation of the London Bridge terror attack \u2013 and increasing the amount that new immigrants pay to use the NHS. Labour will be talking about education today as Jeremy Corbyn visits schools, and the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, will pledge to recruit 20,000 more teachers, cap secondary class sizes at 30, and spend \u00a37bn on repairs and upgrades to England\u2019s crumbling school buildings. They will also promise free, healthy breakfasts for all primary-age children as part of a multibillion pound plan to \u201cpoverty-proof\u201d England\u2019s schools. OK, thanks for reading along, we\u2019ll be with you all day, so keep hitting that refresh button."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
