How did that work? Where did the money come from? And why didn't the relationship between our jobs and houses work in the same way? But telly producers often seem to overlook the bit we're really interested in - namely if I had the same job as Peggy Mitchell/Kirstie Alsopp/Jack Bauer, how much would I earn? And therefore, is it really worth organising that job swap pronto? Luckily we've done the salary homework for you - and provided the essential know-how for organising your career change. Name: Jo Portman (Miranda Raison) Role: MI5 Intelligence officer Programme: Spooks Jo was recruited as an intelligence officer after MI5 officer Adam Carter popped round to read her gas meter. After following him to a MI5 safe house and surviving a shoot-out, he offered her a job. How do you become Jo Portman? Well, hang around at home waiting for Adam Carter to call obviously. But if that fails? MI5 says you should be expecting a 2:1 honours degree or equivalent, or that you should have substantial relevant work experience to apply. They also ask you to take the self-selection questionnaire on the MI5 website before you apply to see if the job is right for you. Additionally, you will need to meet residency criteria: essentially you must be a born or naturalised British citizen, and one of your parents must be a British citizen or have \"substantial ties\" to the UK. Oh. And whatever you do, don't discuss your application with anyone who isn't immediate family. What does the job involve when you're not on the telly? According to MI5, the decisions you make at work \"will play a major part in our efforts to counter terrorism, espionage, the spread of weapons of mass destruction and in protecting the UK's Critical National Infrastructure\". Which sounds, frankly, like an extremely wide job description. But you'll probably begin by assessing intelligence and investigating threats. What does an MI5 intelligence officer earn? Starting salaries for intelligence officers in MI5 are about pounds 23,500 plus benefits and then follow a typical civil service pay structure. You'll also get a decent pension - and presumably all the spy gadgets you can handle. Name: Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley) Role: Ward Sister, Cardiothoracic Ward Programme: Holby City Chrissie Williams is by no means a popular character among the Holby City doctors and nurses - no doubt helped by a series of disastrous love affairs with an entire wardful of obstetricians, registrars and surgeons. Add in no end of trouble with her mother, crossbows and deranged ex-lovers, and it's little surprise she has turned her back on Holby City and headed off. How do you become Chrissie Williams? You will have to first become a nurse and then get promoted to the position of sister, where you will be responsible for overseeing the work of a number of nurses on your ward. Becoming a nurse requires studying for a diploma or degree in nursing. If you already have a degree in various related subjects (including human biology, social work, physiology) then you may qualify for a reduced training period. What does the job involve when you're not on the telly? Non-televisual nurses work in consultation with other healthcare professionals such as doctors and surgeons to assess and implement the appropriate treatment a patient may require. Typical duties include giving injections, checking a patient's statistics such as blood pressure or temperature. There are various nursing specialisms which include A&amp;E, operating theatres or working in the community. What does a ward sister earn? The entry point for graduating nurses in the National Health Service would be at band 5 level, which equates to pounds 19,166 rising to pounds 24,803. As Chrissie has accumulated several years of experience and has line management responsibility, her salary would have risen to Band 7 - which lands anywhere between pounds 24,803 and pounds 36,416 (plus salary weighting for London and overtime payments for anything over 37.5 hours). There's also a final-salary pension scheme. Name: Maurice Moss (Richard Ayoade) Role: IT Support Programme: The IT Crowd As one half of the inept IT department at Reynholm Industries, where the mantra of the support team is \"Have you tried turning it off and then on again?\", Moss has extensive knowledge of engineering, and very little knowledge of anything that can't be coded. Lives with his mum. How do you become Maurice Moss? The obvious answer would be to dress badly and display social traits that would indicate a very limited social repertoire. In fact you'll need some level of computer-related qualification to get into the industry - there are vocational qualifications such as the City &amp; Guilds IT Practitioners Diploma, computer-related further and higher education qualifications, or specialised product qualifications such as the MCDST (Microsoft Certified Desktop Support Technician). You can also enter the profession through an apprenticeship route. What does the job involve when you're not on the telly? A large proportion of time is spent advising workers on how to resolve their software and hardware difficulties, with help also provided by telephone or computer support sites. You might also need to set up hardware systems, maintaining and upgrading the hardware. What does an IT support worker earn? IT support workers start on salaries of about pounds 17,000 to pounds 21,000. As your career progresses and you begin to gain experience and take on management responsibilities, salaries can rise to between pounds 44,000 and pounds 47,000. Name: Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) Role: Pub Landlady Programme: EastEnders The Mitchells have long been involved in the running of The Queen Vic, Walford's premier destination for fizzy lager and a ringside seat for tiffs, fights and arguments. How do you become Peggy Mitchell? There are few formal qualifications, although many skills learned in other jobs will be transferable into the pub trade. These include business skills such as accountancy, customer service and marketing, as well as more specific skills such as catering and hotel trade work. The main qualification needed is to hold a personal licence. The qualification is currently offered by The British Institute of Innkeepers Awarding Body and consists of a short course and a multiple-choice exam. Some pub companies run graduate training schemes. What does the job involve when you're not on the telly? Running a pub involves many different tasks ranging from cleaning the premises before and after opening hours, serving customers, planning and delivering events, and perhaps the preparation and service of food. The management side of the role includes planning the accounts for the business, managing staff and - if you are managing the business on behalf of a company-delivering agreed profits, or meeting other targets for your pub. What does a pub landlady earn? Salaries are low during training with trainee pub managers earning about pounds 13,000. This can increase up to pounds 25,000 once qualified. As you progress and become more experienced in the role then the salaries increase - recent adverts from the British Institute of Innkeeping show salaries at about pounds 35,000 for couples or pounds 25,000 for single people.
