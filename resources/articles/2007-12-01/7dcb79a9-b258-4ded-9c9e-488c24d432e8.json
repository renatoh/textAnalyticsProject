Estranged couple Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are divers encountering aliens while searching for a sunken sub; the domestic business sits uneasily with the multi-million dollar special effects. Smokin' Aces 10.20pm, Sky Movies Premiere (Joe Carnahan, 2006) Down among the casinos of Lake Tahoe, Nevada, Sinatra-ish singer Buddy \"Aces\" Israel (Jeremy Piven) is about to spill the beans on his mob connections. So in no time there's a $1m price on his head and the town's thick with contract killers (including Alicia Keys) and feds (including Andy Garcia and Ray Liotta), setting up a series of stunning action scenes, but precious little else. 24 Hour Party People 11.25pm, Film4 (Michael Winterbottom, 2002) Winterbottom's mockumentary of the 70s and 80s Manchester music scene, shot on funky digital video, is a drunken romp of a movie. Master of ceremonies is Steve Coogan as Granada TV presenter-cum-Factory records boss, the late Tony Wilson. It staggers from primal punk days to the Ha\u00e7ienda raves, in a funny, zippy, resolutely superficial tribute to those wild times."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
