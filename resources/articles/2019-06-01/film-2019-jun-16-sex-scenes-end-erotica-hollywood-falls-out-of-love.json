How Hollywood fell out of love with sex", "bodyText": "For decades, no big-box-office, adult-oriented Hollywood movie was apparently complete without a sex scene, from Don\u2019t Look Now to Basic Instinct. Yet it appears that erotica is now dying out in mainstream cinema. A critical analysis published in the Washington Post last week noted: \u201cSex is disappearing from the big screen, and it\u2019s making movies less pleasurable.\u201d It said that a new summer pattern has emerged: the release of several European-produced festival and arthouse films \u2013 often, like this year\u2019s French drama Mektoub, My Love: Intermezzo, heavy with action \u2013 followed by a season of sexless Hollywood action and family films. Lost between those two options is the classic sex scene. So no more Don\u2019t Look Now with Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland; no 9\u00bd Weeks with Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke; no Dangerous Liaisons, The Postman Always Rings Twice or Mulholland Drive ... the list goes on. \u201cOnce a staple of high-gloss, adult-oriented, mainstream movies,\u201d the Washington Post wrote, the sex scene \u201chas been largely forgotten and ignored, recommitted to the very esoteric margins it sprang from generations ago\u201d. But why? According to academics and close observers of Hollywood culture, the reasons are multifarious, and suggest that the movie business is going through a profound realignment of priorities backed by broad cultural, political and legislative changes. According to Stephen Galloway, a columnist at the Hollywood Reporter, the changes are primarily economic: Hollywood is simply no longer in the business of making mid-budget character dramas that might or might not include physical bonding. Instead, movies must appeal to the \u201cfour quadrants\u201d \u2013 male and female, over and under the age of 25. \u201cWeirdly, it\u2019s not a new puritanism \u2013 Hollywood has always been puritanical. Its about economics,\u201d says Galloway. \u201cInclude sex and you\u2019ll get an \u2018R\u2019 rating, and that means no kids: that\u2019s not going to bring in a four-quadrant audience.\u201d The current exceptions, or at least aberrations, seem to be musical dramas involving homosexual love: witness the success of the Elton John coming-out-and-getting-famous drama Rocketman, or the Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, which has reportedly produced a billion dollars in business for its producers, the group\u2019s drummer and guitar player. But no discussion of sex in the cinema in 2019 can take place without reference to #MeToo \u2013 the movement that has brought profound changes to what women can insist on in their contracts. \u201cWomen feel far less compelled to agree to nudity, and it\u2019s empowered them to say no,\u201d says Galloway. In the current environment, lawyers for actors are demanding more specific, iron-clad protections in \u201cnudity riders\u201d, including the ability to sue for leaked footage. Part of the change, again is economic. Female actors, if they\u2019re lucky, can pick up lucrative fashion and beauty endorsements, both of which demand careful image preparation and maintenance. Having your latest sex scene blasted across the internet is hardly an endorsement of sophistication. The changes, Galloway says, apply equally to television, where despite the greater freedom of content provided by Netflix and HBO, the classic sex scene is still something of a rarity. Where there are exceptions, they can be startling. The new drugs-and-sex teen drama Euphoria starring the former Disney star Zendaya is a case in point. According to reports last week, Euphoria includes graphic nudity (including 30 male exposures in one episode), violence (a statutory rape involving a 17-year-old trans girl) and sex scenes involving choking and drug use, including Zendaya\u2019s character herself overdosing. \u201cThere are going to be parents who are going to be totally fucking freaked out,\u201d Euphoria\u2019s creator, Sam Levinson, son of director Barry Levinson, told Variety last week. But, again, liberating 22-year-old Zendaya from her Disney-princess prison with a shocking coming-of-age series is not quite equivalent to the behaviour that female actors are now taking a harder stance against. From producers demanding unnecessary nudity to the allegations of routine \u201ccasting couch\u201d sexual abuse that are likely to be heard by a Manhattan jury when the producer Harvey Weinstein goes on trial in September, the mood in the movie business has shifted. Professor Linda Hirshman, author of Reckoning \u2013 a major new study of sexual abuse and harassment that traces the origins of the #MeToo movement to the death of Mary Jo Kopechne in Ted Kennedy\u2019s car at Chappaquiddick in 1969 \u2013 argues that the roots of the current anti-sex mood go back to the restoration of the British monarchy in 1660. It was then that women were first allowed to take the stage and treated almost by definition as being sexually available. Fast-forward 300 years, and Hollywood, Hirshman writes, \u201cwas like Restoration English theater on steroids\u201d. Or, as Marilyn Monroe once noted, the men she knew saw Hollywood as \u201can overcrowded brothel, a merry-go-round with beds for horses\u201d. But returning to the days before 1660 may not be what today\u2019s actresses have in mind. In her research for Reckoning, Hirshman says several actresses told her that, although they objected to being pressurised to appear nude, the fact of nudity itself was not the problem. \u201cThey complained bitterly about being abused by their male co-stars when they appeared in sex scenes prior to the #MeToo movement,\u201d Hirshman says. \u201cIn some cases, male co-stars took advantage during sex scenes, touching them where it wasn\u2019t necessary for the scene.\u201d Hirshman believes actresses could have sued years ago under America\u2019s 1964 Civil Rights Act on the grounds of being made to work in a hostile environment. \u201cOf course, it would have been the end of their careers, and of course they didn\u2019t want to sacrifice their ambitions.\u201d She believes the turning point came in 2016 with the Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson\u2019s sexual harassment lawsuit against the head of her network, Roger Ailes \u2013 a landmark case that helped dispel the stigma of bringing a lawsuit. The floodgates opened. But the political and legislative environment matters too: Hirshman points out that California has very advanced employment-equality laws. Female stars such as Reese Witherspoon and Meryl Streep have joined the effort for sexual-equality education, helping to turn the tide against harassment in an industry where career success and failure for aspiring actresses seems to turn on the unknowable machinations of producers, directors and agents, most of whom are male. Just maybe, then, the death of the contemporary sex scene has deeper roots for women in the acting profession than are readily obvious, Hirshman says. \u201cWe can speculate they might be exercising a scintilla of the new power that they now have and putting limits on their exposure to abuse.\u201d X-rated scenes Secretary (2002) Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader portray BDSM roleplay 9\u00bd Weeks (1986) Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger explore a brief but graphic and obsessive affair The Piano Teacher (2001) Michael Haneke directs Isabelle Huppert and Beno\u00eet Magimel in an exploration of sado-masochism Last Tango in Paris (1972) Marlon Brando\u2019s obsession with Maria Schneider becomes a test of sexual disassociation.
