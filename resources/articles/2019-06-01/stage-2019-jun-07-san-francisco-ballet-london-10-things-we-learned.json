The second week of their London run has brought six UK premieres, added to the four last week. Director Helgi Tomasson\u2019s commissions made this tour a genuinely exciting event. 2) Brits are held in high esteem on the West Coast. Five out of the 10 choreographers across the season are British, four American, one Russian. 3) Only one of those 10 choreographers is a woman \u2013 Cathy Marston. 4) Nobody is crazily reinventing ballet, technically or conceptually. It\u2019s more about pulling at its edges, loosening its strings, or putting it in casual wear. In Bespoke, Stanton Welch plays it straight in a work that feels as if it\u2019s made up of the dancers\u2019 favourite steps, letting them show off their best bits with zinging smiles. David Dawson\u2019s Anima Animus goes for bodies presenting themselves as lean, lithe and knowingly beautiful (a little thin on depth and spirit, though). In Bound To, Christopher Wheeldon excels, as ever, in meaningful pas de deux. Trey McIntyre\u2019s Your Flesh Shall Be a Great Poem is the most unclassical of the lot, with pedestrian touches, gleeful scampering, and a soulful solo that feels like movement drawn from inside dancer Benjamin Freemantle\u2019s body. 5) Narrative ballet is still in the minority. The most common approach is loosely thematic, unspecific feels, emotion without always obvious motivation. 6) Platonic male duets are now totally normalised. Whether that\u2019s one cheeky lift among the usual male-female mix in Bespoke, or tender interactions in McIntyre or Wheeldon\u2019s work. 7) Cinematic minimalism is a favourite soundtrack. Philip Glass must currently be the most overused composer in dance (having knocked Arvo P\u00e4rt off the top spot) and his Tirol Concerto propels the supple flurry of Liam Scarlett\u2019s steps in Hummingbird. But the heavy string repetitions of Ezio Bosso\u2019s score for Anima Animus drive down the energy on stage rather than revving it up. 8) Modern life gets a look-in. See: Wheeldon\u2019s dancers with faces glued to phone screens; pop music from Bj\u00f6rk to Keaton Henson, American singer Chris Garneau and electronic outfit M83, which leads to... 9) Justin Peck pretty much lives up to the hype. The New York City Ballet sensation\u2019s Hurry Up, We\u2019re Dreaming is very balletic, but feels fresh, with a youthful authenticity (and not just because the dancers are wearing metallic leggings and plimsolls). It\u2019s set to M83\u2019s music, which sounds like the sun going down at a festival, when the cold has just started to seep in, but the buzz keeps you warm. Peck mirrors the simplicity of pop in clear melodic lines, repetitive hooks and builds \u2013 Dores Andr\u00e9 flying in a series of turns and lifts, again and again. Like its music, Peck gives the viewer clear direction in clever but never convoluted choreography. 10) The dancers are brilliant. Shout-outs for Sasha De Sola, who transformed from the prim perfection of a pageant queen in Bespoke to earnest, lyrical dancer of Hummingbird in the time it took to change costumes; to Angelo Greco, who landed a double tour with such flawless style it made me laugh out loud; and the infectiously joyful jumping of Wei Wang. San Francisco Ballet are at Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, until 8 June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
