Randle El, 36, told the Pittburgh Post-Gazette in story published Tuesday that he struggles to walk down the stairs and has contended with memory loss since announcing his retirement in 2012. \u201cIf I could go back, I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d the former Indiana University quarterback said of the sport that brought him roughly $40m in career earnings. \u201cI would play baseball. I got drafted by the Cubs in the 14th round, but I didn\u2019t play baseball because of my parents. They made me go to school. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love the game of football. But right now, I could still be playing baseball.\u201d An outspoken critic of the NFL and plaintiff in a 2013 lawsuit claiming the league \u201chas done everything in its power to hide the issue and mislead players concerning the risks associated with concussions\u201d, Randle El believes the sport is inherently dangerous and beyond fixing. \u201cThe kids are getting bigger and faster, so the concussions, the severe spinal cord injuries, are only going to get worse,\u201d Randle El said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough pill to swallow because I love the game of football. But I tell parents, you can have the right helmet, the perfect pads on, and still end up with a paraplegic kid. \u201cThere\u2019s no correcting it. There\u2019s no helmet that\u2019s going to correct it. There\u2019s no teaching that\u2019s going to correct it. It just comes down to it\u2019s a physically violent game. Football players are in a car wreck every week.\u201d He added: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if football isn\u2019t around in 20, 25 years.\u201d A star quarterback at Indiana University, Randle El was converted to wide receiver after being drafted by the Steelers in the second round of the 2002 NFL draft and finished his nine-year career with 370 receptions for 4,467 yards and 15 touchdowns. He also made an impact on special teams, averaging 22.3 yards on 79 kickoff returns with one touchdown, and 8.2 yards on 311 punt returns with five touchdowns. Randle El\u2019s most famous moment came in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl XL against the Seattle Seahawks. With the Steelers nursing a 14-10 lead with nine minutes remaining, his 43-yard touchdown strike to Hines Ward on a reverse option would prove the game\u2019s decisive play. Still, he insists the glory was not worth the personal cost. \u201cI ask my wife things over and over again, and she\u2019s like, \u2018I just told you that,\u2019\u201d Randle El told the Post-Gazette. \u201cI\u2019ll ask her three times the night before and get up in the morning and forget. Stuff like that. I try to chalk it up as I\u2019m busy, I\u2019m doing a lot, but I have to be on my knees praying about it, asking God to allow me to not have these issues and live a long life. \u201cI want to see my kids raised up. I want to see my grandkids.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
