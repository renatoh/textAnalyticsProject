Lizzie Gomersall, the Doncaster defender, had gone down with what appeared to be a serious injury and the Belles' bench were calling to Leeds to put the ball out of play. As they were doing so, according to the Leeds manager Mark Hodgson, and with 19 players and the referee united in concern around Gomersall, \"one of their girls nicked the ball, kicked it upfield and scored\". The goal stood. It was always going to be a competitive game. These sides have squared up to each other off the pitch more than once this season over sugges tions of attempted player poaching. For Leeds, said one Doncaster official, as though dismissing the upstarts, \"this was their cup final\". This was poaching of another order, by Jody Handley, and it was as well that Leeds equalised, through Lucy Ward. But there was further controversy when the Doncaster forward Karen Walker was sent off after allegedly saying something untoward to a linesman. While serial postponements have made a mockery of the league table - Leeds stay three points ahead of the Belles having played five games more - yesterday's result was about more than sharing the points. \"When I came to Leeds six years ago we were way down the leagues and Belles were the big local club,\" said Hodgson last week. \"Anyone who was anyone played for them.\" But, while their website claims they are \"consistently ahead of the rest\", the Belles have won nothing since 1994. The Premiership's only independent side, they have withstood approaches from men's clubs. When the professional league launches, so the thinking has gone, what sensible investor could resist the charisma of a uniquely independent women's club? Now, however, the Belles \"are in talks with Doncaster Rovers\", says their general manager Mick Abrahams. They would retain their name but, while the women's game has viewed such an affiliation as a path paved with gold, it is harder to see in this case which might benefit more. Last season top-of-the-table clashes did not carry much meaning. Arsenal beat everyone in sight; the Belles and Charlton were rarely undone by lesser sides. Results tended to obey a discernible hierarchy. But last season there was no Leeds United. When Hodgson's side entered the Premiership in August with the stated aim of a top-five finish, older hands exchanged smiles in private: traditionally, promoted sides have found it hard to survive. So it says as much about the growth of the league as Leeds's individual progress that they hold second place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
