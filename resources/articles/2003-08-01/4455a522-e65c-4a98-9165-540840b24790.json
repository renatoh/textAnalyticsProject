But feelings can be deceptive. The pitch here is not what it once was, which explains why Somerset were 150 for one at lunch and 296 all out. It is difficult to feel in on such an inconsistent surface. Somerset started rapidly against the Second Division leaders and had 56 on the board after 10 overs with most of the strokes coming from their left-handed opener Neil Edwards. An England Under-19 player, Edwards scored nine and 10 on his championship debut against Northamptonshire this month. But he is better than that. He stands tall and plays pace well. He faced only 39 balls here and struck nine fours in his 45, scored out of 63. So it was disappointing when he was out, caught at slip by Hick. It was one of two catches for the former England player. But he also dropped two, both chances offered by Michael Burns. The Somerset captain top-scored and hit 15 boundaries but he was out for 89 when Hick made amends. Nantie Hayward had bowled five overs for 33 and not taken a wicket at lunch. But he came back to finish with three for 53 from 11. There were three wickets too for Matt Mason. When Worcestershire batted Anurag Singh was soon caught behind and Hick, after a flurry, was bowled, both falling to Aaron Laraman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
