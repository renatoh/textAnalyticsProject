Australian barrister Jay Williams was seeking to appear in court to represent Rod Henshaw, an Australian who lived on Nauru and who was deported in controversial circumstances by the Nauruan government. He also represents more than 1,000 asylum seekers on the island in an ongoing legal case surrounding their detention in the Australian centre on the island. The Nauruan government is now seeking to strike out Henshaw\u2019s claim as well as those on behalf of the asylum seekers who alleged their human rights are being violated in the detention centre. In an email from the Nauru immigration office, Williams\u2019s application for a business visa is refused with only the words \u201cThis is denied\u201d provided to explain the decision. The visa refusal is now facing an appeal in the Nauruan district court, while the government is continuing with its own motion to strike out both major court cases. The application for judicial review by Henshaw, obtained by Guardian Australia, said the decision to deny Williams\u2019s visa is a breach of natural justice and procedural fairness, and names the secretary of justice, Lionel Aingimea, as the respondent. \u201cThere was no evidence or other material to justify the making of [the] decision to deny the legal representative of the plaintiff a visa,\u201d it said. It said Aingimea \u201cexercised power for an improper purpose, to deny the plaintiff his constitutional and common law right to legal representation\u201d and was an attempt to \u201cpervert the course of justice\u201d. A series of other court documents also reveal that the Nauruan secretary of justice personally intervened to prevent Williams being admitted to the Nauruan supreme court. Williams applied for admission as a barrister of the Nauruan supreme court on 10 October 2014. But two weeks later, on 28 October 2014, he was issued with a summons by the district court of Nauru, facing charges of accessing a restricted area dating back to events in January. Aingimea\u2019s objection came a day after Williams was charged with the offence. While on a previous visit to Nauru in February 2014, Williams had been a passenger in a car with a Salvation Army employee, Adam Savage, who dropped Williams off at the airport. On his way to the airport, Savage turned off onto the airstrip entrance \u2013 a restricted area \u2013 and performed a number of \u201cdonuts\u201d on the airport runway. Savage said in a statement that Williams urged him not to take the action, and Williams was not charged at the time. In a letter to the Nauru DPP, Williams\u2019s counsel said the charges were \u201cbaseless\u201d and a way to block the proceedings. \u201cA baseless charge is brought against Mr Williams, in an attempt to block his admission and to further obstruct the Henshaw matter and the asylum seeker case,\u201d the letter said. It continued: \u201cIf at any stage, the Office of Public Prosecutions has received undue interference or pressure from members of the executive, to prosecute the charge against Mr Williams, without foundation and without evidence, then the Office of Public Prosecutions has a duty to the court and to the administration of justice to vigorously resist such interference and pressure, no matter what the professional or personal cost may be and ventilate such interference and pressure with the court at the first opportunity.\u201d The charges were later dropped by the DPP and Williams succeeded in being admitted. But in May 2015 his business visa was denied without reason, despite the imminent proceedings. A legal challenge to the visa decision is now under way. The maze of dynamic legal proceedings on the island have emerged as part of an ongoing dispute that first began when Henshaw \u2013 a former resident of Nauru \u2013 received a deportation order from the government. His deportation was temporarily halted by former magistrate Peter Law. But Law himself was then deported from the country and prevented from re-entering, in the first of a series of blows to the integrity of the judiciary on the island nation. Henshaw, whose wife died on the island in 2013, said the long-running case was a serious denial of natural justice and had placed immense pressure on him. \u201cPsychologically it\u2019s just devastated me, quite frankly. Whatever way this case goes, I would have liked this to have been over, quite frankly, a lot sooner.\u201d \u201cNot being able to get back to the island to visit my wife\u2019s grave has been difficult enough, but being bashed around the head with these proceedings has been incredible hard. \u201cThere are serious consequences here for these proceedings. You\u2019ve got to wonder how the Australian government and the New Zealand government feel about these kind of decisions.\u201d Henshaw and Law\u2019s deportation was followed by the resignation of the former chief justice, Geoffrey Eames, as well as the solicitor general Stephen Bliim. While his legal case is a civil claim relating to seeking damages, his claim was later amended to include the contempt of court charges against the Nauruan president, Baron Waqa and the justice minister, David Adeang, following the deportations. Further concerns continue to be raised about Nauru, with the blocking of several websites including Facebook and the recent deportation of the general manager of telecommunications provider Digicell. The Nauruan government and Adeang have not responded to requests for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
