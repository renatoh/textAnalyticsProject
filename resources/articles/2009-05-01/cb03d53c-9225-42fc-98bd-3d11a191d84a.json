That was in 1695; there was to be no such drama this time. Michael Martin bowed to the inevitable yesterday, informing the house he would next month relinquish his office for the sake of unity, in a terse three-sentence statement. One day earlier, even as his authority visibly drained, he had continued to signal he would try and cling on. In the hours in between, he had been paid a prime ministerial visit, had heard David Cameron sound intensely relaxed about his unseating and had seen a no-confidence motion pop up on the order paper. A day is a long time in politics. Dodgy dealings and absurd expense claims have shattered parliament's reputation, and Speaker Martin had to go because of his role in trying to keep these things under wraps. His departure is a precondition for repairing the damage, but it is no guarantee that the restoration work will even begin. That will happen only if the Commons picks the right successor \u2013 and then empowers them to get on with the job of real reform. Gordon Brown yesterday trailed a second statement from the Speaker, which set out detailed cross-party agreements for tightening up on expenses, ahead of Sir Christopher Kelly's report on the allowance system. Significantly, all parties have finally committed to accept that in full. So the house got there in the end, albeit at the cost of a Speaker not to mention untold damage to its reputation. After the disastrous attempt to refashion parliament on YouTube, the prime minister at least gave a competent performance, defending the sensible move to outsource pay and rations. There is a pressing need for this change, but passing new powers to unelected technocrats will never achieve the wider aim of reconnecting parliament with the people, and Mr Brown spoke in mere hints when it came to this democratic agenda. After expectations had been stoked, this felt disappointing, though it may prove no bad thing in the end. It will be far better if impetus for change comes from the house itself, and especially from the new Speaker. The Commons has long been a low-flying aircraft, vulnerable to hitting the rocky peaks of public contempt. Weird customs, odd hours and a narrow demographic mix all distance it from the country it claims to represent. But what sets it apart more than anything is the fact that much of its work amounts to bad theatre. Synthetic indignation, pantomime comedy and predictable votes \u2013 all marshalled by parties that few voters now identify with, and all controlled by the government's whips. True, the Commons has shown a little more independence of late, as over the Gurkhas. But such rare government defeats are hardly enough to tame an overmighty executive. For the first time, MPs will now have a secret ballot to choose their next Speaker. Each will thus have a chance to use their independent judgment to choose the man or woman best placed to give the house an independent voice, instead of being pressed into making a choice that is amenable to the whips. Pathetic talk of a pre-election stop-gap candidate must be swept aside: this is no time for a caretaker. After two successive Labour Speakers, the house might best be served by a Liberal Democrat or a reforming Conservative, although character counts far more than party. The right person will be a parliamentarian who commands universal respect for fairness and independence of mind. Vince Cable, Dominic Grieve and Richard Shepherd would all be strong candidates, though others may emerge. Whoever is in the chair, however, parliament will lack the power it needs without a more thorough recasting of the constitution. The prime minister's modest new suggestions in that direction, though, render that a discussion for another day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
