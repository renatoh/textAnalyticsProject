Wednesday's Old Firm encounter, earlier viewed in many quarters as solely Rangers' opportunity to all-but secure the Scottish Premier League title, now also represents a genuine chance for Celtic to reignite hopes of a race worthy of the name to the finishing line. Their showing at Fir Park, perhaps borne out of desperation after a miserable run of only a single victory in seven outings, was as dominant as Gordon Strachan's team have been all season. Now four points behind Rangers, two remaining SPL Glasgow derbies offer Celtic hope that they can, after all, claim a third league crown in a row. Strachan, publicly berated by supporters eight days earlier, was backed with equal voracity by his players here. \"That makes everybody, especially the strikers, feel better about themselves,\" admitted the Celtic manager, who maintains a failure to be ruthless in front of goal has been their sole recent failing. \"Our football was nothing like as good as in the last five games but there was total commitment. It just shows you that goals can turn total commitment into a great performance. Goals are the most important statistic, that's football.\" Troubled times had called for back-to-basics team selection. Already without the suspended Scott Brown, Strachan opted to jettison the strikingly out-of-touch Massimo Donati and restore the industry of Paul Hartley and Barry Robson to his central midfield. Both justified their manager's faith, although on a surface which more closely resembled a Spanish beach than a Lanarkshire football pitch, it was the creative brilliance of Shunsuke Nakamura which shone through. It seemed, in fact, entirely fitting that Motherwell spent a week building up to this match on a training break in Malaga. \"I think we had as many chances to deliver balls from wide areas as Celtic did today,\" said the home side's manager, Mark McGhee. \"But the quality of our delivery was nowhere near as good as that of Robson and Nakamura.\" Crosses from the mercurial Nakamura were responsible for Celtic's first two goals, Stephen McManus bundling the ball home with his shoulder after 17 minutes while Scott McDonald volleyed his 27th goal of the campaign beyond Graeme Smith, with the aid of a deflection from Mark Reynolds, on the half-hour mark. In between times, McManus had scored into his own net when attempting to clear Ross McCormack's angled drive; the shot was going wide at the time of the Celtic captain's intervention. While the visitors' defence appeared more ragged at times than Strachan would doubtless appreciate, their attacking prowess could not be open to question. Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink notched his opening goal of the afternoon, two minutes before the interval, with a free header from Robson's corner. Celtic's Dutch striker soon put matters out of the sight, sending a fierce drive into the top corner of Smith's net after a routine Lee Naylor throw-in prompted chaos in the hosts' backline. Motherwell remain in a close battle alongside Hibernian and Dundee United for a Uefa Cup place next season and rallied slightly in the closing stages - Artur Boruc saved brilliantly from Stephen Hughes - but to no avail. Strachan, who last weekend listened to fans urging him to exit Parkhead permanently, was now treated to exuberant verse from those who are suddenly and eagerly anticipating Rangers' two visits in the space of 11 days. Celtic's manager resisted the opportunity to add further intrigue to the upcoming derbies, but in the words of McGhee: \"If Celtic win on Wednesday, I think a lot of people will think differently about the title race. It is just a question of whether they can re-produce that performance against Rangers.\" Man of the match Shunsuke Nakamura (Celtic)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
