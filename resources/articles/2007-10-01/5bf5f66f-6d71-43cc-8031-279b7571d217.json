After two days of tortuous negotiations the union released the briefest of statements. 'The agreed terms covering all the issues in the dispute will be considered by the union's executive on Monday. Both parties will make a further statement thereafter.' The two-sentence statement was signed by Adam Crozier, the chief executive of Royal Mail, and Billy Hayes, secretary general of the Communication Workers Union, and his deputy Dave Ward. Neither side would reveal what the agreed terms were. Tomorrow, at 2pm, the 15 members of the CWU executive will vote on whether to recommend the terms. If, as expected, a majority does, all further strike action will be suspended while CWU's members are balloted on whether to accept the settlement. The result of the postal ballot should be known in a month, the union says. But even if workers accept the terms, the wounds will take some time to heal. The dispute between Royal Mail and postal workers has been reminiscent of old-fashioned industrial struggles. Once again, unions and management appeared more entrenched the longer the dispute went on. Until this weekend's breakthrough, the only thing that Royal Mail and the CWU had been able to agree on is that the strikes have not been about pay, but about how the state-owned enterprise was run. This was a fight over the future of Royal Mail. If it turns out that the unions have got everything they wanted by holding Royal Mail to ransom, it could be a pyrrhic victory and the organisation may not have much of a future. Industrial action took place intermittently over the summer, escalating in recent weeks. Last week, a two-day strike again prevented the vast majority of mail being delivered across the country and caused a backlog that staff are still struggling to clear. Workers were offered a 2.5 per cent pay rise earlier this year, which the CWU rejected. But what was really unacceptable for the CWU - and, judging by the strikers' enthusiasm, for its members - was Royal Mail's insistence that changes to working practices were also agreed. Specifically, Crozier wanted an end to 'Spanish practices'. He said there are 92, which he claimed made the business 40 per cent less efficient than its non-unionised private sector competitors. Ward, who joined Royal Mail 35 years ago as a postman, had likened the proposed changes to 'slavery'. So who was in the wrong - the workshy posties or the slave-driving management? The working practices at the heart of the dispute centred on how much - and what kind of - work postmen and women, drivers and sorters have to do. Excluding breaks, the typical working week is 37 hours and 20 minutes. But workers often finish their delivery round or daily allocated tasks up to two hours before their shift finishes. Under current working practices, staff can go home or claim overtime for the extra work they do during their shift. Management was also unhappy about the commonly accepted practice of workers refusing to do different types of work at the same office. (So, for example, sorters will not deliver mail and vice versa.) The CWU does not dispute the existence of most of these working practices (though it says some claims are exaggerated). But the union's head of communications, Kevin Slocombe, says staff should not be penalised for finishing their round early by being made to do additional work. The reason staff finish ahead of time is because they carry more mail than health and safety guidelines recommend, use their own cars and don't take their allotted breaks, he says, adding: 'Postal workers are already flexible.' He points to staff in Watford, Southend and Streatham in south London, who recently decided not to save time in these ways to show management they were not underworked. Not surprisingly, they found they could not deliver all the mail on time. He also disputes the claim that Royal Mail staff are paid a quarter more than counterparts at privatised firms, but says that since other companies' pay scales are not available, he cannot substantiate this. And he blames Royal Mail for being less efficient than competitors by delaying the spending of a \u00a31.2bn government loan to introduce more sorting machines (about half of all post is still sorted by hand). Both sides have a point. It's true that staff are not well paid - the average basic weekly wage is \u00a3323 - but Royal Mail insists they are better paid than workers at rival firms - and, it says, they have to do less work. And it's human nature for staff to try to squeeze the best deal out of management by exploiting their monopoly position. Royal Mail makes 89 per cent of its revenues from business contracts, such as delivering direct mail for companies. It will not release figures on how much business it has lost as a result of the strike, but online retailer Amazon has already cancelled a contract. No doubt many others have followed suit; rival DX has reported a 25 per cent increase in orders this month as banks, holiday companies and ticket agencies in particular defect. Howard Webber, chief executive of consumer group Postwatch, says: 'The damage is very, very severe and will take a huge amount of clawing back.' The regulated part of Royal Mail, which accounts for the vast majority of its business, is already operating at a loss. Last year, losses rose on the back of higher pension contributions and as rival companies delivered more mail. The government indicated that it wouldn't intervene in the strike, and that it was up to the unions and management to come up with an agreement that allowed Royal Mail to compete with private sector rivals. If unions declare total victory over this weekend's agreed terms, they may not be celebrating for long."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
