It involved a hamburger, a popular fast-food chain, and a photograph that became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. One November evening in 2012, the CSKA Moscow manager was taking his wife to a show in the city when the man who hopes to plot Manchester City\u2019s downfall in Tuesday evening\u2019s crucial Champions League encounter felt peckish. As time pressed Slutsky, who is sometimes lampooned in his homeland for his weight, decided to pop into a McDonald\u2019s for a snack. On doing so the man whose CSKA side are Russian champions, ordered a burger and was photographed tucking into the patty in a picture that became widely circulated. Slutsky began as a goalkeeper before a fall from a tree ended any playing hopes. A self-educated, bookish character at ease discussing science and Russian literature, his decision to visit the golden arches made him the unwanted lead in \u201cthe night of the hamburger\u201d, being incessantly teased and being forced to fend off endless questions about his diet and the example he might be setting. A comic episode for media and fans proved the opposite for Slutsky, who can be choleric. \u201cHow should I react to this?\u201d he said. \u201cWe had plans with my wife to go to some show. I had 10 minutes left. It was six o\u2019clock in the evening. I was starving and stopped by McDonald\u2019s. I had no time to go to some place nice. I didn\u2019t do any commercials for junk food. Millions of people go there to eat. \u201cPeople used to take an interest in football, goals scored. Now they are interested in some insignificant things around football. The fact that Slutsky gorged on a sandwich [hamburger] is suddenly interesting, not how CSKA plays or what methods of training we use.\u201d The Slutsky persona can be the focus of other cruel humour. CSKA host City on Group E\u2019s third matchday in an empty Arena Khimki due to Uefa\u2019s stadium ban for the repeated racist behaviour of fans. In last season\u2019s Champions League CSKA were forced to relocate to Zenit St Petersburg\u2019s home to take on Viktoria Plzen for similar reasons. As a coach who can appear close to a heart attack during matches, Slutsky\u2019s penchant for pulsating with worry in his seat was picked up on when Zenit next played at their ground as Luciano Spalletti, the coach, joked his chair had become unstable. Yet beyond the tongue-in cheek stuff Slutsky, now rated Russia\u2019s finest coach, has also proved a controversial figure. During the 2008-09 season when in charge of Krylia Sovetov Samara, he was engulfed in a match-fixing scandal that, although he emerged innocent, bruised his reputation and caused wounds that forced resignation. This was an episode far darker than burger-gate. Sovetov were accused of purposely losing a game at Terek Grozny in an encounter replayed later on national television for those who may have missed the live broadcast. In a surreal moment for Russian football, for the first time a match was shown on TV without any commentary \u2013 only the noise from the crowd was allowed \u2013 in the hope of allowing a forensic examination of the case. This all duly increased pressure on Sovetov and Slutsky and though nothing was proven and there were no sanctions from the authorities, controversy lingered. An upset Slutsky left at the end of that term to accept an offer from Yevgeny Giner, the CSKA president and owner. Apart from Valery Gazzaev, a Russian who won several titles and the Uefa Cup for the club, CSKA had recently employed only foreign coaches \u2013 Artur Jorge, Zico and Juande Ramos \u2013 so Slutsky\u2019s appointment was a surprise. It has proved prescient. There have been two championships, two Russian cups, and two Russian super cups, with Giner always backing his man \u2013 as he did particularly following bad results at the start of Slutsky\u2019s tenure. The rise of Slutsky, who is expected to become national team coach one day, has been stellar. Although a goalkeeper when in Volgograd, where he was born, his main focus was coaching and even before the accident it was debatable if he was good enough to have sustained a professional career. The fall from a tree when helping a girl rescue her cat ruled any hope out. Yet Slutsky\u2019s true calling was illustrated when managing a first team, Olympia Volgograd \u2013 who, despite being the city\u2019s second club behind Rotor Volgograd, had a renowned academy. Slutsky embraced working with the club\u2019s younger players and is considered a key factor in many careers, including that of striker Roman Adamov and Denis Kolodin, a defender who represented Russia at Euro 2008. After three years at Olympia a short stint at Uralan Elista, a former top-tier club that collapsed when Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the Kalmykia Republic governor, lost interest, ended in 2004. Slutsky joined FC Moscow as the second team coach, before taking the No1 position in 2005. Working with limited funds, he proved a success. In 2007, there was a Russian Cup final lost in extra-time to Lokomotiv Moscow and a serious title challenge that ended with the club fourth and claiming Uefa Cup qualification. Yet despite overseeing FC Moscow\u2019s finest ever campaign he was fired and moved to Sovetov for that unhappy spell before arriving at CSKA. There, Slutsky has already made history, taking the club to the Champions League quarter-finals in the 2009-10 campaign before Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s Internazionale, the eventual winners, knocked them out. That was the best performance by any Russian club in the Champions League. Now, Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side arrive at the Arena Khimki with only a point from two matches. As Slutksy\u2019s side have a zero return from their two outings he knows CSKA must beat City to have any chance of catching Bayern Munich and Roma. Do so and City are staring at an early exit from the competition, and the weakness Slutsky once showed for a burger on a cold Moscow night should recede further into the consciousness."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
