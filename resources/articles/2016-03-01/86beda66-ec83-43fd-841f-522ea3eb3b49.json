Labour backbencher Paula Sherriff, who has waged a campaign against the 5% VAT charged on sanitary products, has laid an amendment to the budget resolution enacting the chancellor\u2019s tax plans. If implemented, it would allow MPs to strike down the tampon tax when the finance bill is debated later this month. Sherriff has won the support of Eurosceptic Conservative backbenchers, who resent the fact that Brussels rules prevent Britain from altering the scope of VAT. Conservative Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who is campaigning for Britain to leave the EU after the referendum on 23 June, said: \u201cThe people we elect should be responsible for setting the taxes in this country \u2013 not unelected EU judges and bureaucrats. It is a fundamental principle of democracy that there should be no taxation without representation, which is what we now have.\u201d \u201cOur chancellor is unable to take this decision that will benefit women because VAT is controlled by the EU. The only way to get this change is to Vote Leave on 23 June.\u201d Sherriff, the MP for Dewsbury since last year\u2019s general election, said: \u201cI genuinely feel really passionate about this. It\u2019s a tax on women. The fact that tampons are taxed at 5% suggests they\u2019re a luxury item. I can\u2019t think of anything less luxurious.\u201d Osborne sought to assuage backbenchers\u2019 anger over the tax in his autumn statement in November by allocating the \u00a315m of revenue raised to a series of charities that benefit women. In his budget speech he said \u00a312m had already been set aside to causes including Breast Cancer Care. But Eurosceptic backbenchers, of whom there are more than 100, could decide to make trouble for the chancellor by supporting the amendment. The scale of unrest on Conservative backbenchers was underlined last week when the government suffered an embarrassing defeat over plans to liberalise Sunday trading rules, which had been spearheaded by the chancellor. Sherriff insisted she would not rest until sanitary products are zero-rated for VAT. The speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, will decide whether to accept the amendment, which could be the subject of a vote on 22 March. Labour\u2019s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Seema Malhotra, has pointed to leaked documents suggesting the European commission is considering proposals that would hand back powers to the chancellor, allowing him to abolish the tax. Sherriff called on him to prioritise the issue in negotiations with Brussels. Alison Thewliss, the SNP MP for Glasgow Central and another member of the 2015 intake, is another supporter of the amendment. Leave campaigners have sought to win over feminists to their cause, with Eurosceptic employment minister Priti Patel even comparing those urging a no vote in June\u2019s referendum with the suffragettes who fought for women to be given the vote."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
