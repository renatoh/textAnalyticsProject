While researching the care needs of frail elderly religious people, I have become aware of the very serious financial plight that many communities of nuns now find themselves in because they are denied pension credits. I was approached time and again by nuns asking for my support. I have tried, unsuccessfully, to bring this matter to the attention of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) but each time I am just directed to their official guidelines, under \"special rules for special people\"; \"if you are a member of a religious order, and are fully maintained by a religious order, you are not entitled to pension credits.\" Other \"special groups\" are people in prison and in hospital - who, unlike nuns, are maintained by the state. I have copies of letters that various enclosed communities have written to their MPs and to the DWP and in every case they were given the same set answer without any possibility that anyone would take the time to investigate whether there is a case to be made for changes to this archaic law. Currently many nuns are denied the pension credits because they are deemed to be \"fully maintained\" by a religious order - without even a superficial enquiry into the individual's source of maintenance. This seems to be based on total ignorance of the economics of religious orders. The DWP acts as if these institutions provide funds for the support of their members from an external source of benevolence, idealised as \"the Order\", or \"the Diocese\", or - even more vaguely - as \"the Church\" and visualised as receiving regular financial aid from \"Rome\". This is pure fiction. Nuns have traditionally been required to give the monastery a dowry, if they could afford it, at the time of solemn profession. This would be used to provide for the community and returned (without interest) if the nun left. It was never the practice to receive any money from \"the Church.\" By the middle of the last century the whole notion of \"dowry\" had fallen into abeyance. Women who wished to embrace the monastic life brought their education, skills, and strength to promote whatever form of home industry the previous generations of nuns had set up to make income - such as baking and selling communion wafers, doing church needlework, printing cards or doing translation. Some still rely on the investments brought in during the days of dowries, although these suffer all the vicissitudes of \"fixed incomes\" and the uncertainties of the investment markets that other elderly people experience. Many of the women have had some experience of work before entering the monastery, and are entitled to a work pension. They paid National Insurance contributions and on entering the monastery their contributions are kept up, at the voluntary rate, out of the common bank account. They therefore expect to receive a state sension at the appropriate age; if their pension is minimal then, along with other recipients of below-average pensions, they are invited to apply for the pension credit. These applications are usually favourably received until someone notices from the postal address that the applicant is \"a member of a religious order\". In many cases the application is then automatically refused with no further enquiry into how the applicant is maintained. The lack of any systematic attempt to understand the real economic situation results, in my opinion, in blatant discrimination. I am trying to raise awareness of this issue because not only do I feel it is a matter of justice but also because it is difficult for nuns to make their needs public. This is partly because a few elderly nuns have been awarded pension credits because they filled in the forms omitting the title of sister but had the credits withdrawn and had to pay the money back as soon as it was known they were member of religious orders. Yet the information regarding savings, income, etc had been given on the forms and that information had not changed following the discovery that the woman was also a nun. One nun wrote to me: \"The tribunal judge said the pension credit could be paid to the eligible sisters if they could prove the community is autonomous and not supported by others.Our autonomy is real enough, but it is difficult to know how to 'prove' it to people who can't/won't see the obvious. If only they stopped trying to make a special case out of our being nuns, and just look at us as a group of women who run a small business (of whatever kind) as a joint project, earning their own keep, and having a joint bank account; divide the total assets among the number of people in that household, and judge the financial status accordingly.\" There is an appalling inconsistency in the way pension credits are awarded even within the same group of nuns living in the same house. It seems to be the luck of the draw as to whether the forms get past the first hurdle or rejected out of hand. \u00b7 Diane Frewin is a research associate at Anglia Ruskin University.
