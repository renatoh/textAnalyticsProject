No tweets from the Bird Cage. And not even a protest at the gates of Flemington. It might be the race that stops the nation, but how will the cup stop a city that only just started up again? \u201cI\u2019m still going to get dressed up,\u201d Melbourne milliner Natalie Bikicki told Guardian Australia. \u201cI\u2019ll put a hat on my son, get dressed up and head down to the local park for a picnic and some champagne. \u201cI\u2019ll watch the race. I really like the energy of it, so I\u2019ll have to watch it live.\u201d Normally Bikicki is off her feet this time of year. She would attend cup day as a guest in a salubrious marquee, and is usually called upon to judge fashion awards on one of the other major race days. But in March, with Covid-19 sweeping through Europe, she predicted it would not be the usual spring racing carnival. Sales are down, but interstate clients have ordered many more hats than previously, and Bikicki is grateful that the Melbourne Cup carnival still held millinery awards, despite the lack of crowds. She is one of 10 finalists in the awards, with her creation symbolising an antidote to the pandemic: a heart exploding with joy. \u201cI\u2019d normally be so stacked, I wouldn\u2019t have answered the phone,\u201d Bikicki says. \u201cI kind of had a disconcerting feeling this would be a long haul. I was just looking at the global situation and seeing that we\u2019d been trickling behind. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to [still] be part of it. I\u2019m so glad they\u2019re having the millinery awards. It was a lovely distraction and challenge.\u201d The possibility of crowds at the cup was dashed late last month after the public backlash to the Andrews government\u2019s plan to allow owners on track for the Cox Plate \u2013 the government reneged on the plan as a result. There will be events to mark the day across the nation, from the Sydney Opera House to the Darwin turf club. But you\u2019d be hard-pressed to get a beer or watch the race in the three pubs closest to the finishing post, with Melbourne\u2019s lockdown only lifting last week and retailers subject to strict opening conditions. Two of the pubs on Racecourse Road, Flemington, will be closed when the race is run. The third, The Newmarket, isn\u2019t taking bookings and can only have a maximum of 10 people in each of its indoor areas. The furthest pub from the track on Racecourse Road, The Quiet Man, has been fully booked for 70 people since last Monday. But it doesn\u2019t open until 4pm \u2013 an hour after the race starts. \u201cThat\u2019s just our normal opening hours on a Tuesday,\u201d a spokesman for the pub said. The Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses has cancelled its usual protest on the morning of the race in favour of a virtual event and is selling \u201cNup to the Cup\u201d face masks. It protested at the Flemington gates on Monday with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and will hold a small meeting at a nearby park. \u201cWe may not be able to host our usual \u2018in real life\u2019 picnic and protest this year, but we can still protest the cruel Melbourne Cup from wherever else we may be on this day,\u201d the group posted online. \u201cAs a statement against animal abuse, please take a photo of yourself wearing your ... \u2018Nup to the Cup\u2019 face mask, or if you prefer, simply hold a sign stating \u2018Say Nup to the Cup\u2019 and post it on all of your social media pages at, or as close to 9am as possible on the morning of the Melbourne Cup. \u201cLet\u2019s ensure social media is flooded with messages of kindness for horses, not cruelty.\u201d Kristin Leigh, a spokeswoman for the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses, said she was hoping the pause in crowds could mean the cup becomes less relevant this year. The group is also planning to hijack social media posts relating to \u201cfashions on the front lawn\u201d, which have replaced \u201cfashions on the field\u201d this year and drawn entries from across Australia. But perhaps the biggest impediment to Melbourne engaging with the cup will be the forecast of spring sunshine, coming only a week after the end of more than three months in lockdown. Melbourne is forecast to nudge 30C on Tuesday afternoon, meaning it could be the warmest day since March \u2013 weather more conducive to the beach or the park, rather than perched in front of a television watching a horse race. Police are expected to patrol public areas to ensure no breaches of the chief health officer\u2019s restrictions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
