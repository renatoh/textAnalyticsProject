The FO was heavily criticised after the Bali bombing for failing to pass on intelligence warnings. The Commons intelligence committee criticised the way information was distributed. The British government has also offended some countries by issuing advice against travel after bombings. The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, said: \"We have extensively reviewed and improved our travel advice since Bali. But I have asked officials to look again at some of the underlying issues. What is the right balance between information, warning, and advice?\" Advice should be the most detailed and factual possible. But in responding to a terrorist attack, \"can we ensure prudent precaution does not become overreaction, which risks playing into the hands of terrorists?\" The review is scheduled for completion by the end of next month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
