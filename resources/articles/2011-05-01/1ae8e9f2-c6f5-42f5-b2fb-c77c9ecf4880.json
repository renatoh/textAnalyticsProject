After triumphing only once in his previous five play-off campaigns, the Scot has come to the conclusion that they are nothing more than a \"lottery\". It feels like an apt description in more ways than one. After all, Deloitte estimates the play-off winners will be guaranteed to pick up a \u00a390m bonanza, a figure that includes \u00a348m in parachute payments spread over four years should they be relegated. Reading and Cardiff City, who will meet at the Madejski Stadium on Friday night in the first leg of their semi-final, are the other two clubs hoping to get their hands on that windfall. The bookmakers have installed Swansea as slight favourites to win promotion at Wembley on 30 May in what could yet be an all-Welsh final. There appears little to choose between the four clubs, although Cardiff have a psychological battle to overcome. Swansea, Reading and Forest all had their eyes on automatic promotion at one stage or another, but Cardiff mounted the most sustained challenge for second place before losing their way when it mattered most. Norwich sealed promotion in their place in the penultimate match of the season, leaving Dave Jones, the Cardiff manager, with the difficult task of trying to rouse his deflated players, many of whom have another reason for dreading the play-offs after losing to Blackpool in the final last year. \"Everyone just has to get over this disappointment about being in the play-offs because it's crazy,\" said Jones. \"Even the dressing room was talking like that, but to be in the play-offs again is a fantastic achievement. Look back over three or four years: [FA] Cup final, play-offs again. If that's poor, ask the rest of the teams that aren't in the play-offs. It's still a good achievement to get there so I wish people would stop knocking us because we haven't got automatic promotion.\" Although Cardiff's attacking options make them formidable opponents at this level, Jay Bothroyd's form has tailed off since he made his England debut against France in November and Michael Chopra has struggled with injuries. Craig Bellamy, who has been outstanding in the last couple of months in particular, has proved far more reliable, yet the erratic nature of Cardiff's performances and their defensive fragility \u2013 they conceded more goals than any of the other play-off contenders \u2013 will give Reading cause for optimism. Not that Brian McDermott's side need much encouragement after a remarkable final three months of the season. \"If you'd said to me on the 12th of February 'you'll make the play-offs' I'd have taken it,\" said McDermott, whose side were 12th at the time. \"We are top of the Championship's form table over the last 17 games, so go into the play-offs in high spirits. The players have done fantastically and our form is as good as anybody's.\" Swansea are not short of confidence themselves. Brendan Rodgers has produced the best footballing team in the division and would have been celebrating automatic promotion if he had found a remedy for their poor away form. Swansea can be exhilarating to watch, especially on the flanks, where Nathan Dyer's creativity and Scott Sinclair's penetration \u2013 the former Chelsea winger has scored 24 goals in 47 league and cup games this term \u2013 have complemented one another and wreaked havoc. \"I can see where [the bookies] are coming from,\" said Rodgers, reflecting on Swansea's odds. \"I think if you have watched us for the majority of the season, you will see our qualities and know we can hurt any team. And in the big games, nine times out of 10, the players have performed. So I suppose we've got the ingredients to do it. I've always said I believed in the team. Whether we do it or not is a different matter.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
