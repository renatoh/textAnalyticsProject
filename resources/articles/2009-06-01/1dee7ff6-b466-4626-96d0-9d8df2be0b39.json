It started in late April when I went down to watch Horden play in the Durham Senior League. I'd gone to Horden because they'd signed an 18-year-old West Indian named Kelbert Walters as their professional. The Anguillan was in the last (in more ways than one) Stanford Superstars squad and was reputed to be quick. The Durham coast in April is not the ideal place for a Caribbean cricketer, however. In Horden the sky was the colour of a smoker's lung and showered down icy rain the texture of sputum. \"I'm not saying it's cold,\" one of the locals cracked down his mobile, \"but they've brought the roller on with huskies.\" Walters struggled with the conditions. Trying to extract bounce from the wicket was like pouring water on lard. Back in the 1980s another promising West Indian teenager, Ian Bishop, had been the pro at Tynedale. A friend of mine played against him. I asked him how fast the Trinidadian was. \"Not as quick as I thought he'd be,\" my friend said. \"Mind, he could barely turn his arm over with all the jumpers he was wearing. Looked as if he'd got the local plumber to lag him like a boiler.\" I took shelter in the clubhouse and found myself looking at a framed photo of a successful Horden team of the early 1970s. Standing in the back row was a middle-aged West Indian wearing wire-framed spectacles and a benign expression. I read the caption and made a note of his pleasingly poetic name, Clairmonte Depeiza. A couple of weeks later I was at the Fountains Garth Ground to watch Guisborough play Blackhall in the North Yorkshire and South Durham League. It was a fixture I'd seen quite a lot as a teenager, because Blackhall's team had included Desmond Haynes, while Guisborough fielded a South African with what I considered the highly entertaining moniker of Ivor Foulkes. Apart from getting to see a West Indian Test player smack a ball from some bloke who'd bullied you at school over the bus station for less than a quid, a visit to Guisborough in the early 1980s had a bonus attraction. For an additional couple of pounds you could have tea, which you got to eat in the same room as the players. This is not something that happens at Lord's. Many among you may have seen DL Haynes bat, but I think there will be few who have watched the great man eating a cheese savoury bap and a slice of sand cake. During another rain break I wandered into the Guisborough members' lounge and the first photo I looked at was of the team that had won the 1970 Kerridge Cup, and who should be there amongst them but Clairmonte Depeiza. Last week I went to Haslingden in Lancashire, which, aside from boasting a cricket club that down the years has employed players of the calibre of George Headley, Dennis Lillee, Andy Roberts and Phil Simmons, boasts one of Britain's best pie shops. Looking down the list of professionals who had turned out at Bent Gate I found, sandwiched somewhere between Vinoo Mankad and Clive Lloyd, CC Depeiza. When I got home I looked through the cricket books on my shelf. The only pre-1970s Wisden I own is the 1955 edition inherited from a colleague of my father's. I flicked through it and sure enough there on page 874 was Clairmonte Depeiza scoring 122 against Australia in the fourth Test at Bridgetown. \"Another Australian victory appeared in prospect when six West Indies batsmen were dismissed for 146,\" read the report, \"but Atkinson and Depeiza came to the rescue, defying the attack for more than a day.\" He played in five Tests in total, that record\u2011breaking stand with Denis Atkinson against Lindwall, Miller and Benaud a memorable high point. CC Depeiza was one of a host of West Indians who have to come to play league cricket in the north of England. Many of them, like Bishop and Walters, were pace bowlers of a type you wouldn't ordinarily expect to face on a Saturday afternoon. The ferocious Roy Gilchrist took 37 hat-tricks during his 21-year spell in the Lancashire leagues; in a single season at Burnley Charlie Griffith picked up 144 wickets at 5.20 apiece and hospitalised his West Indies team-mate Conrad Hunte (playing for Enfield at the time) into the bargain. When he was at Littleborough in the mid-1970s Joel Garner so terrorised opposition batsmen that one of them came in to face him wearing a fireman's helmet. Depeiza wasn't quite so dramatic, but he was highly skilled, popular and did his job well enough to find his way into the reckoning whenever veteran cricket fans in what were once the cotton towns start to discuss an all\u2011time Lancashire League West Indian XI. He settled eventually in Manchester and died in 1996. As well as Horden, Guisborough and Haslingden, Depeiza also did his job for Heywood and Crompton in the Central Lancashire League and at Strathmore in the east of Scotland. I can't say I've so far planned to go to Forfar but the way things are working out I'll likely end up there at some point in the next couple of months."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
