Mario Mandzukic\u2019s goal in extra time ensured Croatia will face France in the final on Sunday, with England now having to face Belgium in the third\u2011place play\u2011off 24 hours earlier. But Kane, who is in pole position to become the first England player since Lineker in 1986 to win the Golden Boot, insisted he was proud of his team\u2019s performance. \u201cIt hurts a lot,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cIt will hurt for a while. We can be proud and we\u2019ll be back. Thanks for all your support. #ThreeLions.\u201d Jesse Lingard was among the first players to express his sadness at the result and the Manchester United midfielder was full of praise for his teammates. \u201cWas an honour to represent my country at the World Cup. The squad we have is a great bunch of lads who are willing to learn and give everything and we can hold our heads high. Thank you to everyone who supported our journey. We don\u2019t stop here!\u201d Lineker scored in England\u2019s last World Cup semi-final against Germany 28 years ago and he also praised Southgate\u2019s side for their performances in Russia. \u201cUtterly choked, but this young side gave absolutely everything,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge step forward and they\u2019ll only get better in the future. They can hold their heads high, they did our country proud. Congratulations to Croatia.\u201d The former Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright added: \u201cHappiness in the journey! We can\u2019t only be happy if we win. Proud of this team. Proud of our country. That was beautiful.\u201d England\u2019s Under-17 and Under-20 teams have both been crowned world champions in the past 12 months and the success of the senior side in reaching a semi-final for only the third time in their history was welcomed by Jadon Sancho, who now plays for the German side Borussia Dortmund having featured in the Under-17 victory in India last October. \u201cBeen really inspired watching @England. Unfortunate not to make it to the final. The boys have done the country proud.\u201d The four-times Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton added: \u201cI\u2019m so proud of our Boys &amp; to be honest, the whole country. I\u2019ve been inspired by the spirit of our people all coming together during this time. It\u2019s what makes me so proud to be British. Let\u2019s hold on to that fighting spirit &amp; stand tall &amp; United. It will come home one day!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
