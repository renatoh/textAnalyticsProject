After the Treasury denounced the forthcoming book - written by former No 10 economics adviser Derek Scott - as \"peddling lies\", Downing Street today joined the chorus of disapproval, saying the book was intended to \"make money and cause trouble and division\". The potentially damaging book comes after an apparent thawing of relations between the prime minister and his chancellor, with well placed insiders saying the often tempestuous relationship is on its most even keel in years. However, following last night's denouncement by the Treasury after an inflammatory Sunday Telegraph article, which said the book would detail \"stand-up rows\" between Mr Blair and Mr Brown, No 10 today stressed the book was \"totally unauthorised\". Mr Scott was economics adviser at No 10 from 1997 until December last year, and will be the first of Mr Blair's close advisers to publish a memoir. It is likely to be ready in time for this autumn's Labour conference. However, Downing Street dampened expectations on publication, saying the autobiography, entitled Off Whitehall, was currently being vetted by the cabinet secretary, Sir Andrew Turnbull, to see if it breached the Official Secrets Act. The spokeswoman said Downing Street had been unaware of it until it was submitted for clearance by the Sir Andrew. She said that books of this nature were written \"to make money and to cause trouble and division\". She added: \"As far as we are concerned, the book will not cause any division and I would caution you about believing everything you read.\" Asked if the government would take steps to prevent its publication, she said: \"The book is being looked at by Sir Andrew Turnbull at the moment.\" Last night a Treasury spokesman issued a rare rebuttal, saying: \"This deliberate peddling of lies and distortions about Europe, tax and public spending and the management of public finances is deliberately designed and orchestrated to put the Treasury in a bad light and will not be tolerated.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
