Newcastle and West Brom are going through bad patches at the moment and I was interested to see that Graeme Souness cancelled his players' Christmas party and Bryan Robson talked about working his squad even harder. There's no miracle cure for a loss of form but I think there a few things to bear in mind. The most important thing is not to panic or do anything drastic. The best manager I had in those situations was Alex Ferguson. He just demanded and you knew if you didn't deliver you'd be dropped. That was a scary thing when you were on \u00a3200 a week and needed to be in the team to get appearance money. But with the money players are on now, you can't scare them that way. That doesn't mean it's wrong to be tough and that Graeme was wasting his time cancelling his players' day out to Edinburgh or Robbo shouldn't be getting his boys to train more. I'm all in favour of stopping those Christmas parties. A party with the wives and staff is OK, but a boys' night out is not needed. It's got nothing to do with Christmas anyway, and it's manna from heaven for the tabloids. As for extra training, that can be a good thing as long as the players realise it's for a reason and not a punishment. You have to tell them it's because no one can just wait for things to get better. You need to show them you're leaving nothing to chance and be seen by the public to be reacting. You cannot sit back and hope things change. People can talk about bad luck or missing chances but you need to do something. Maybe you work on the same things as usual but put more hours in, or do more studying with the players, watching videos to see where things are going right and wrong. It's important not to do anything drastic, though, because you have to stick to what you decided was needed when you first came. It's no good changing the way you play or switching players the whole time. The lads can think you don't know what you're doing and you can confuse them. When you get to a club, after two or three weeks you usually have a sense of what's needed and draw up a plan. At Southampton I decided after a couple of games that the players needed to be fitter and we had to get balls into the box for James Beattie. Things didn't start too well because we drew the first game and lost the next three, but I knew my plan and kept to it. It doesn't mean you can't change little things. When I first got to Coventry, Dion Dublin was playing up front but wasn't scoring so we stuck him at centre-half and stopped losing goals at set pieces. Then he scored a few goals as a defender, we put him back up front and we were on a run. But it's not just things on the pitch that matter. What you do off it is important as well. Media-wise I think it's best to keep quiet otherwise you can add to the chaos. In terms of dealing with the players, you can't plan whether to go hard or soft on them. Your emotions determine it after a game and anyway different players need different treatment. You can be harsh on the ones you think can respond to that but you have to watch for the ones you think you might lose. You might need players for only six or seven months but you need to keep them onside before you move them on. The next month will be so important for Graeme and Robbo because for the first time they can sign players. You need one or two who are used to your methods. Brian Clough would take John McGovern and John O'Hare with him everywhere he went. At Southampton I got Paul Telfer and Paul Williams from Coventry almost right away. It was before the transfer window existed and I knew them and knew they understood what I was about. When I said to the lads: 'That's what I want', they would reaffirm it in the dressing room and that helps. Graeme's been unfortunate in that he's had to chop and change because of injuries but I think he knew things were going to get worse at Newcastle before they got better. Everyone told him it was a club in turmoil and some of the discipline was poor and he needs time to tackle that. I spoke to him recently and he's good. Bryan has obviously been hurt by some of the West Brom fans' chants and that's the problem you can get when you go back. The way you want to play might take five, six, seven weeks to get through to people, but you get no time now. Both of them are under big pressure but they're not just waiting for things to get better. And when you're struggling, that's vital."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
