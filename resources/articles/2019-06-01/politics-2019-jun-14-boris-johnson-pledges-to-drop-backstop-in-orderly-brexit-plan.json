The former foreign secretary declined an invitation to participate in the Channel 4 leadership debate, saying he feared it would be \u201ccacophonous\u201d. But under growing pressure to submit to greater public scrutiny after Jeremy Hunt accused him of \u201chiding away\u201d, Johnson said he would take part in a similar event, hosted by the BBC, next Tuesday. Channel 4 confirmed its debate would go ahead at 6.30pm on Sunday night and a lectern would be on stage, with Johnson invited to turn up at any point and face a live studio audience of potential Tory voters. One source working on the programme dismissed Johnson\u2019s suggestion that negotiations had broken down, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s classic deflection; all the negotiations were very cordial. The reason he didn\u2019t want to do it is because the format meant he would have to debate with the others.\u201d The BBC was delighted that it has the first major public debate involving Johnson on Tuesday night. Its format, hosted by Emily Maitlis, does not involve a studio audience and will instead see the remaining candidates take pre-submitted questions from viewers around the UK. After Hunt invoked Winston Churchill, asking what the wartime leader would say, \u201cif someone who wants to be prime minister of the United Kingdom is hiding away from the media\u201d, Johnson on Friday submitted to his first broadcast interview since the campaigns kicked off. He was at pains to soothe some of his colleagues\u2019 fears that handing him the keys to 10 Downing Street will make a no-deal Brexit on 31 October all but inevitable. Johnson said he would achieve an \u201corderly, managed Brexit\u201d on deadline, by ditching the Northern Irish backstop in favour of \u201calternative arrangements\u201d. \u201cI think that we can get to a situation in which we are able to leave smoothly with an orderly, managed Brexit, and that\u2019s what we should be aiming for,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s World at One. \u201cBut the only way to make sure that we convince our partners that we\u2019re determined to get that outcome is to prepare for no deal \u2013 and I think people do understand that.\u201d Asked what he would do about the backstop, which he described as \u201cthat prison, that Hobson\u2019s choice\u201d, Johnson pointed to the Brady amendment. Passed by parliament in January, with the support of the government, the amendment called for the backstop to be replaced with unspecified \u201calternative arrangements\u201d \u2013 although the government then tried to renegotiate this with Brussels and failed. Johnson suggested the solution could be the \u201cmaximum facilitation\u201d approach he advocated while in Theresa May\u2019s cabinet, from which he resigned over her Chequers deal last summer. He added that the full details should be left to be worked out as part of the next phase of negotiations over Britain\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU. \u201cThe facilitations that need to be provided to enable that to take place \u2013 those should not be preordained by the backstop. They should be remitted into the implementation period for discussion after we have left,\u201d he said. The EU27 have repeatedly insisted on the backstop as the legal underpinning of both sides\u2019 commitment to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. \u201cOur friends and partners over the channel will say we can\u2019t do this, this is a unicorn,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut I think there is a solution to be arrived at in this area, and we should work hard for it.\u201d Opposition politicians have now raised concerns that the high number of televised debates between pro-Brexit Conservative politicians will dominate the airwaves over the summer. Ed Davey has written to BBC director general Tony Hall to ask for a televised Liberal Democrat leadership debate, arguing that his party outperformed the Conservatives at the EU elections. He said only showing debates between Tory candidates pushing \u201cwall-to-wall pro-Brexit propaganda\u201d could result in the broadcaster \u201caiding and abetting a monstrous pro-Brexit bias which future generations might find hard to forgive\u201d. Hunt came second on Thursday, but with 43 votes, trailed far behind Johnson. He sought to up the ante against the frontrunner on Friday, asking, \u201cwhat would Churchill say if someone who wants to be prime minister of the United Kingdom is hiding away from the media, not taking part in these big occasions?\u201d A source in Hunt\u2019s campaign said afterwards, \u201cthe underdog is getting hungrier\u201d. Johnson said, \u201cI think it is important that we have a sensible grown-up debate. My own observation is that in the past when you\u2019ve had loads of candidates, it can be slightly cacophonous and I think the public have had quite a lot of blue on blue action frankly over the last three years\u201d. As well as setting out more details of his Brexit plan, the former foreign secretary sought to burnish his liberal credentials by promising early legislation to enshrine the rights of EU citizens in law. \u201cThere is a clear way that the now effectively defunct withdrawal agreement can be disaggregated: the good bits of it can be taken out,\u201d he said. Hunt\u2019s challenge to Johnson has been hampered by the fact that moderate Tories have failed to unite behind a single \u201cstop Boris\u201d candidate. The former health secretary Matt Hancock dropped out of the race on Friday. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, had hoped the pair could strike up an alliance of \u201cchange candidates\u201d; but when they met on Thursday after the votes were counted, neither man was able to convince the other to withdraw. Hancock will now spend the weekend weighing up whether to support Michael Gove, or simply throw his weight behind Johnson. Johnson denied having used cocaine since a \u201csingle inconclusive event\u201d more than 30 years ago. The former foreign secretary, who has repeatedly appeared to dodge questions about previous drug use throughout his campaign, said he had only used the class A substance once. Johnson described the incident as \u201ca single inconclusive event that took place when I was a teenager and which I have extensively described\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
