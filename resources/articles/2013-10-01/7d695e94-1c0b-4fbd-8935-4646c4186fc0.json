The capacity crowd was represented by all sides of the community. All political emblems and colours were discarded as the crowd united in giving the fighter the deafening reception that he relishes when he boxes at home in Belfast. Before the fight, Frampton asked Parodi to not run, and to stand toe to toe to give the public a brawl that they would enjoy. Parodi, a skilful fighter from Toulon who has been defeated only once in 37 contests, duly ignored Frampton and fought on the outside throughout. The Frenchman's reluctance to engage in any sort of aggression counted against him as Frampton stalked him across the ring and hit at will with speedy combinations. Frampton's chosen nickname of \"The Jackal\" was apt, as he seized upon the defensive frailties of his opponent with ruthless efficiency. He found success with strong right hooks to the body in the early rounds that sapped Parodi's spirit and left him weak. The crowd stamped their feet and yelled at any offensive inroad from Frampton that left the result looking inevitable, even after the third round. Parodi's limited offensive repertoire consisted of a rather feathery jab that rarely brushed Frampton's face. In the fourth round, a swift upper cut snapped Parodi's head back and Frampton chased after him, sensing an early stoppage. By the fifth round, Frampton was finding success with both hands and leaving the Frenchman almost defenceless. The end came in the sixth round. Frampton caught Parodi with a ruthless sharp left hook to the midriff, leaving his opponent on his knee, unable to breathe or continue to fight. After this victory, the Belfast crowd will be hungry for a proposed IBF title fight after Christmas, and Frampton's desperate wish to get world recognition will surely become a reality."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
