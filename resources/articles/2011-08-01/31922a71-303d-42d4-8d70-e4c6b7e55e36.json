Bowes, 68, died in hospital last night after he was set upon in Springbridge Road during Monday's disorder. The Metropolitan police said a murder investigation had been launched. Detective Chief Inspector John McFarlane, of the Met's Homicide and Serious Crime Command, said: \"This was a brutal incident that resulted in the senseless killing of an innocent man. I still need the assistance of the community who may have witnessed the attack on Richard to come forward and provide information or images they may have recorded on mobile devices. This information could be crucial in catching his killer.\" McFarlane had earlier appealed for any members of his family to contact them. Police later said that next of kin had been informed and a postmortem examination would be held in due course. ITV news reported that Bowes' sister was on her way to London from Derbyshire. The 73-year-old said her brother had given her away at her wedding but they had been out of touch for 30 years. Bowes, originally from Bournemouth, lived in a house on Haven Green, minutes away from where he was knocked to the ground on Monday night. It is believed he lived there alone. He was attacked after remonstrating with youths trying to set fire to two industrial bins on Springbridge Road, near the Arcadia shopping centre, which was being looted. Visiting the area, the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: \"There are many villains in this story, but also many heroes, and I want to pay particular tribute to Mr Bowes. But he has paid a terrible price. I am desperately sorry for him and his family.\" Josh, manager of local pub the Haven Arms, was full of admiration for Bowes: \"Personally, I would've done exactly the same. He was doing what he thought was right. Fair play to him.\" A police officer saw Bowes being knocked over by a \"mob\" of youths at about 10.45pm on Monday. Officers later gave first aid and took Bowes to hospital. Footage of a suspect \u2013 described as black, in his early 20s and wearing a white T-shirt with writing on the front \u2013 has been released by police. In one video, he is seen outside a nearby McDonald's with sunglasses on his head. McFarlane appealed for the man to \"do the decent thing and give yourself up\". Speaking about the attack before his death, Bowes's sister, Anne Wilderspin, told ITV News: \"It was sort of unreal because you don't think anything like that happens to a relative of yours. \"I mean we've been horrified by the reports of the riots and what's been going on.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
