North America's western resorts continue to have ideal ski conditions. In Canada, Sunshine Village has enjoyed a dusting of snow and last week's metre of snowfall at Whistler/Blackcomb has paved the way for glorious, sunny spring skiing, with 320cm of the white stuff packed down on the upper slopes. Snow coverage of 200-225cm remains excellent in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and more is expected. Resorts including Aspen (135/147cm) and Snowbird (180/185cm) in Colorado and Utah have received some new snow, with good skiing at all levels. In Europe, the lower slopes are getting a little slushy. Low-level rain has fallen at Courchevel, M\u00e9ribel and Tignes in France although the upper areas are still good, with 170cm of snow. Conditions in Andorra are very favourable for this time of year and 135cm of snow on the upper slopes bodes well for Mayrhofen in Austria which hosts the Brit Games from 30 March to 6 April. Deal of the week Snowboard fanatics can enjoy the Brit Games festivities in Mayrhofen with Thomson Ski and Snowboarding (0870 606 1470). Departures on 30 March include return flights from Gatwick, transfers, and seven nights' bed-and-breakfast accommodation at the Obermaier Hotel.

Snowboarders can show off their skills in the freestyle competition, or check out the latest equipment and enjoy a demonstration of new winter sports craze snowskating (a bit like skateboarding). With British DJs spinning tunes in the Fun Park and at clubs Speak Easy and Arena, there will be no shortage of partying after a day on the slopes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
