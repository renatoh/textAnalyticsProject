But the \"public catharsis\" of which you speak in the wake of the HBOS collapse ought to include much more than a bar on him and his fellow reckless directors being company directors for what they inflicted on their shareholders and, above all, the British taxpayer. They ought to be made answerable in damages, as they could be if the government sued them for the tort of misfeasance or breach of fiduciary duty, to seek to recover what it can of the \u00a320bn we paid to prop up the bank. Even if the claim failed, there would be considerable publicity for such an action and pressure for legislative change to ensure bankers don't get off in future. And Crosby might just permit his conscience to stretch to contribute to the reimbursement of those who have lost out, mimicked also by Andy Hornby and Lord Stevenson. Benedict Birnberg London SE3 Rights and wrongs of welfare In the current debate about the contributory principle in welfare, one side seems to say that you should only get out what you put in. What would be the point of that, except to support a totally private system? In his admirable letter (The Big Issue), Michael Somerton highlights his good fortune in not needing unemployment or disability benefit, notwithstanding his contributions. What you take out depends on circumstances, not on what you've put in, assuming only that you've put something in. I've paid out more in car insurance than I've ever got back, because I've been lucky enough not to damage either a vehicle or, worse, a person seriously. Others have paid in less and got out more. Isn't this what insurance is supposed to be like, and national insurance no less so? John Filby Ashover Derbyshire Media role in measles cases Catherine Bennett appears to blame the medical profession in general and the NHS in particular for not giving her clearer advice on the MMR inoculations (\"We've seen sense on measles, but we're not yet rid of quacks\", Comment). This was not the case. In 2000, when Dr Wakefield's research cast doubt in many people's minds, the NHS was very clear in its advice. The MMR jabs are perfectly safe and any link with the development of autism is totally spurious. The reason that Catherine may have had any doubts over the safety of the MMR jabs was probably due to the wide publicity given to Wakefield's research by newspapers. More than 3,000 articles appeared in the British press around the period, most of which cast doubt on the safety of MMR. The regional and local press in South Wales was especially active on the issue, which is why we have the current outbreak of measles in that area. Dr Jeremy Swinson Liverpool The fallacies of GM crops The food experts cited in John Vidal's piece (\"Millions face starvation as world warms, say scientists\", News) confirm the conclusions of the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) in 2008. The IAASTD's recommendations, based on the work of 400 scientists from all over the world, have been largely ignored and the shift towards an agro-ecological approach based on smallholder structures and more localised food systems is still not being seriously considered. The promises of GM crops have long been shown to be empty. Today, we are producing around 4,600 calories per head a day globally \u2013 enough to nourish the nine billion expected to inhabit our planet by 2050. But production and consumption patterns and distribution systems have to change and the food system should no longer be open to speculation and patent rights that enrich the few while almost one billion people are starving. Instead, we should invest much more money in researching and disseminating knowledge of the much more promising agro-ecological approach to meet the challenges ahead. Hans R Herren Laureate of the World Food Prize and co-chair of IAASTD, president of Biovision Foundation, Zurich Move over, Darwin One of the key aims of the 2014 national curriculum proposals is for our children to learn historical facts in chronological order. Topics such as \"Victorians\" will no longer be taught in primary schools and children in key stage 2 will not be taught history beyond the end of the reign of the Stuarts. Unfortunately, no one appears to have communicated this information to the authors of the primary science curriculum. The science consultation document suggests that children should learn about paleontologists such as Mary Anning (1799-1847) and the work of Charles Darwin (1809-1882). Perhaps Mr Gove should drop his concerns about issues such as joined-up handwriting and focus on the failings in joined-up thinking within the Department for Education.
