Walk first through age-old dunes, generously dusted with tufts of pale green grasses, then down to the soft terrain of the Bann estuary, where the path follows the river's edge and returns to the wide, golden beach. Sand dunes, being sand dunes, can be quite heavy going while you're on them. Good boots and strong legs will help, but buggies and wheelchairs are impossible. Why it's special The 6,000-year-old dune ecosystem is teeming with wildlife, certain to delight any child with a keen eye and a gentle step. There are rabbits to be spotted nibbling at the marram grass, and a multicoloured carpet of bird's-foot trefoil, wild pansy and thyme to explore, aflutter with butterflies and bees. In the estuary there are wintering waders and wildfowl feeding on the mudflats, as well as a host of migratory species passing through in the spring and autumn. Keep your eyes peeled for Rare wild orchids can be spotted here during the summer months. Look out for pyramidal orchids with their slender, unbranched stems crowned with a tall stack of petals like mini Marge Simpsons dressed in pink, and bee orchids that sport large, pale pink or white sepals on either side of the velvety labellum in the centre, brownish red with yellow markings \u2013 hence the name. Recover afterwards The Portstewart Strand visitor centre offers ice-cream and soft drinks, hot drinks and sweets aplenty, while Morelli's , slightly further afield on the promenade in Portstewart, offers a taste of old-fashioned seaside fun. This gelato parlour has been serving sundaes since 1927. If it's tipping down The many galleries and cultural venues in Portstewart will provide for beauty of a different kind \u2013 head to Flowerfields Art Centre for exhibitions by local artists, gigs and art classes.
