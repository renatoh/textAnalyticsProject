He is not a man who believes sitting back and relaxing, having a pleasant time, is the way to get the most of the world. Given the season that West Ham are enduring, that might be just as well. Saturday\u2019s game against Swansea City was a sliding-doors moment for West Ham and their manager. Lose and not only would they be in serious peril of relegation but the board would have been left with a ticklish decision to make over Bilic\u2019s future. Win and they would realistically be safe from the drop and the prospect of playing Championship games in the echoey surroundings of the London Stadium. The 1-0 victory ensured the latter: with six games remaining they are eight points clear of the bottom three and, while Bilic maintains: \u201cWe\u2019re nowhere near to doing the job,\u201d only a remarkable turnaround would see them drop from here. The instinct is to think this has been a lost season. In their new home, a year after finishing seventh and flirting with Champions League qualification, to be in any danger of relegation appears a huge step backwards. But Bilic seems to be in the \u201cwhat doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger\u201d camp; he believes their struggles might be beneficial in the long run. \u201cThis season could be one of the most valuable for the club and the team,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to do the job [ensure survival] first but this experience makes you really motivated not to be in it again, and it makes you stronger. That\u2019s why these kind of situations are much more valuable \u2013 afterwards \u2013 than a steady season, which is just OK\u2019. But it\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s not enjoyable to be there.\u201d It certainly did not look enjoyable on Saturday. A game devoid of quality from two very jittery teams was tough to watch from a neutral perspective but the added tension must have made it unbearable for those involved. Bilic, bad hip and all, hobbled around the technical area, looking like a man waiting in a hospital for bad news. In the end the worst was not delivered but for 90 minutes he seemed in existential agony. At the end he did not so much celebrate as half sink to his knees in the most blessed relief. No wonder. Mark Noble, making his 400th appearance for the club, called it \u201cour biggest win for a few years\u201d and Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9, the man who fired home the winner from outside the area, said it was his most important goal for the club. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been good enough for a couple of months,\u201d said Noble, \u201cbut this should release the pressure.\u201d Could the release of that pressure mean that more than simple survival is realistic? So tight is the lower-mid part of the Premier League that Saturday\u2019s victory took West Ham from relegation possibles to within touching distance of 10th place. \u201cWe can still finish in the top half,\u201d said Bilic, when asked what success would look like this season. \u201cThis is possible but let\u2019s do the minimum job first.\u201d For Swansea life looks bleak: they are only two points shy of the last safe spot but Paul Clement admitted his team looked far too anxious for such a big game. That anxiety will only get worse as time ticks by, so he will have to fix what has gone wrong in the last five games pretty quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t fret about what the result might be or what\u2019s happening at other stadiums or what might happen if we don\u2019t win,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just have to focus on playing a game of football. That\u2019s it.\u201d While Swansea are left to worry about the remainder of their season, Bilic was free to kick back and think about other things. \u201cI have four kids, I have two dogs, I have a young wife, my brother is here, my friends are here, so probably we will stay in,\u201d he said when asked how he would celebrate. \u201cBut we ain\u2019t going to watch football.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
