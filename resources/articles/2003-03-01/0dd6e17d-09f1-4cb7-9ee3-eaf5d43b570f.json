The Secondary Heads Association said it had received eight times more calls to its hotline in the last fortnight from deputy and assistant headteachers worried about being made redundant as schools battle to balance the books, compared with the same period a year ago. Asked how many redundancies were likely, the union's general secretary, John Dunford, replied: \"I wouldn't like to put a figure on it but I would point to the word 'unprecedented'. \"When budgets are decided on the first of April we shall communicate to the secretary of state the reality of budgets across the country,\" he said. \"If the situation is as grave as we believe it to be, we shall be looking to him to go to the Treasury for more money.\" Heads were in \"shock mode,\" Mr Dunford added. Delegates at the SHA's annual conference in Birmingham said today the situation would make it difficult to implement the \u00a31bn agreement to cut teachers' workloads, which depends on schools having the means to hire more classroom assistants, not lay them off. A shortfall of 5% has been mentioned frequently at the conference. Problems were mainly due to higher salaries and pension costs, as well as the 1% rise in national insurance and reduction in the number of different streams of money coming from the standards fund, the SHA said. Schools were facing an average 10.5% jump in costs and were getting an extra 11.6%, amounting to \u00a32.6bn more in 2003/04 for the whole of England. But the way money is allocated to local authorities has changed and some schools were receiving less than a 10.5% increase in their budgets, it explained. The education secretary, Charles Clarke, faced tough questioning when he addressed delegates at the conference this afternoon. They demanded to know why so many schools were facing deficits of hundreds of thousands of pounds at a time when education spending was going up. Heads from across the country queued up to tell him of their problems and demand action. Michael Chapman, from Driffield school in east Yorkshire, said it was \"by far and away the worst budget settlement we have had to manage in east Yorkshire in 12 years\". Jane Mann, head of The King Edward VI school in Morpeth, Northumberland, said the county's 15 high schools were facing average deficits of \u00a3100,000. Linda Austin, head of Swanleigh school in Tower Hamlets, east London, warned the strain on funds \"may well lead to a reduction in staff\". Mr Clarke acknowledged there were \"major pressures on schools and LEA budgets\", which were uneven across the country. He also admitted the rise in national insurance and pension contributions, and the shifting of cash from the standards fund to mainstream budgets, had caused \"turbulence\". However, he said he was \"genuinely shocked\" to hear this was the worst settlement in 12 years. \"If we go back to 1991, say, and look at spending per pupil, I just don't understand how this could be worse.\" Mr Clarke had been bullish in his dismissal of complaints about finances on Thursday, telling a conference of local authority education chiefs in London that he didn't \"feel positive\" about people who complain about money \"because normally it is an excuse for people not doing what they should\". Mr Dunford said the education secretary had struck \"an altogether different tone\" this afternoon. \"He was clearly recognising the financial problems most headteachers are facing, and wanted more information on the difficulties of the situation.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
