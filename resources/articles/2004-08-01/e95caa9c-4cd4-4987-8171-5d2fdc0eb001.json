Kop said he pulled a male sampling officer out of the toilet in Turkey where his wife was providing a recent sample and locked a female official inside the testing room. The officials had allegedly seen Ayhan holding two samples during one test and asked her to hand them both over. She reportedly refused and poured one of the samples down a toilet. It has been claimed Ayhan, who will miss the games because of injury, may have tried to pass off another woman as herself and that signatures on testing documents did not match. Kop has denied in a written defence that the runner had cheated. No one was available at the Turkish Athletics Federation for comment. Meanwhile the Irish 10,000m record holder, Cathal Lombard, yesterday admitted he had taken the blood-boosting agent EPO. The 28-year-old Cork solicitor, who had improved his personal best by more than three minutes since 2003, said: \"I didn't set out to try and win medals or to make money. I just wanted to be as competitive as I could and have an equal chance with everyone else. I am not trying to justify what I did in any way; I am just saying this was the case, this is what I did and, hands up, I did it. I don't want doping in sport but it has certainly reached epidemic proportions.\" Torri Edwards, the world 100m champion plans to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against her two-year doping ban in a final attempt to be allowed to run in Athens. The Guardian revealed last week that the American had been found guilty by the IAAF after testing positive for a banned stimulant at a meeting in Martinique in April."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
