The FA announced that \"no action will be taken\" against the French striker \"following an alleged use of the elbow during the Charlton v Arsenal game on Saturday\". The incident involving Henry and Charlton's midfielder John Robinson was not seen by the referee Steve Dunn but captured by television. The FA then announced it would \"investigate the incident further\", despite simultaneously announcing David Beckham would not face any action for his apparent use of the elbow on Leeds' Lee Bowyer on the same day. However the FA, having considered the Henry incident, said: \"The matter has not been referred to the video advisory panel and the investigation is now closed.\" \u00b7 Manchester City have decided not to sack Richard Dunne after the Republic of Ireland defender agreed to carry out a \"specialist training programme\". Dunne's future at the club was on the line after he turned up for training in a dishevelled state on Friday. City have imposed the maximum fine of two weeks' wages on the 22-year-old but, after a meeting yesterday morning between the manager Kevin Keegan, Dunne, the directors John Wardle and Dennis Tueart and the chief executive of the players' union (PFA) Gordon Taylor, the club said, \"a decision has been taken not to terminate Richard Dunne's contract\". City added: \"Richard Dunne has accepted the seriousness of his situation having had similar disciplinary problems in the past.\" \u00b7 Tottenham's midfielder Tim Sherwood will complete his \u00a3250,000 move to Portsmouth by the end of next week. The 33-year-old has agreed a two-year, \u00a310,000-a-week deal with Harry Redknapp after Spurs agreed to pay off the final nine months of his contract. The former England international will become Redknapp's 11th signing in his six months as manager of Pompey, who are top of the First Division."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
