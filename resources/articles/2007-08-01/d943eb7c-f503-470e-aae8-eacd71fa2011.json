Every day I'm out there with the cast of my show, Stonewall, set during the gay riots in New York in the 1960s, and told from the point of view of a young drag queen with glitter in his eyes. We get glittered up and chat and flirt with other actors. Some of them even tell passers-by to come and see Stonewall: the ultimate compliment. The set is a pair of glittery curtains. We arrived in Edinburgh to find that they had got so tangled they resembled a singed afro. So we had to cancel a preview to wait for another pair from London. I was gutted, but audiences since have made up for it. Ten per cent of the audience is gay; one group of teenage girls has come five times, perhaps because the actors have abs to die for. This year is great because my brother, Gary Beadle, is in The Pornographer Diaries. Often we hang out in the C Venues bar, surrounded by student actors, feeling like teachers at the school disco. The best stuff I've seen is by students. One Night Stand at the Pleasance Dome is a musical improvised every night by a group of young Americans. And a student production of Road blew me away. I'm also seeing as much dance as I can. The Korean dance piece Ballerina Who Loves B-Boyz was unbelievable. It made me put my iPod on and dance home. \u00b7 Stonewall is at the Pleasance Courtyard (0131-556 6550) until August 27."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
