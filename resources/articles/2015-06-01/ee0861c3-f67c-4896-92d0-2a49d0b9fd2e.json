This month, it was in the headlines again after Talha Asmal, a 17 year old from its Savile Town area, killed himself in an Isis suicide attack on a refinery in Iraq. The two deaths bookended a decade of unfortunate publicity for the town. In the wake of the latest one, David Cameron has called on Muslim communities to do more to stamp out radicalisation. In Deswbury, his speech was met with frustration and disappointment by the people who say they feel marginalised, starved of funds and abandoned by officials who are far quicker to condemn than to reach out to Muslims. They feel these same people are oblivious to the wider problems that fuel radicalisation. \u201cWe are a community under siege,\u201d said Fakhera Rehman, after breaking the Ramadan fast at a community centre and mosque that welcomes both men and women. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know who they can talk to, what they can say, how they can say it, how they can ask for help.\u201d Rehman should be a natural leader in the fight against extremism. Devout, smart and articulate, she is manager of an interfaith forum and a concerned mother of a teenage boy, but in a few weeks funding cuts will close her group. \u201cI totally agree with some parts of what David Cameron was saying, by saying we shouldn\u2019t do finger-pointing. But that\u2019s exactly what they are doing \u2026 putting the burden of responsibility on the Muslim community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are multiple communities: I have a school community, I have a work community, I have a neighbourhood community, and we need to all be working together. It needs to be different faiths, different backgrounds, male, female, young, old.\u201d Tai says Dewsbury is being unfairly tarred by the coincidence that it was home to one man radicalised before he arrived in the town and the largely online grooming of a vulnerable teenager 10 years later. London bomber Khan only moved to the area a few months before his death, and is thought to have been radicalised mostly in a bookstore in his former home in the Beeston district of Leeds. Asmal\u2019s family appear to have been oblivious to their son\u2019s hardening views. \u201cThere is no way [his father] would have let his son go. What parent would?\u201d said Hanif Patel, a local businessman who knew the family. He was so shocked by Asmal\u2019s radicalisation that he has not been able to face even paying a condolence visit. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019ve not been to see them, because I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d It is a revulsion everyone in Dewsbury says they share. \u201cI have never seen this \u2018silent condoning\u2019. We are all horrified,\u201d said retired parole officer Mohammad Razaq. \u201cWhich mosque is not condemning them?\u201d Mixed in horror at the attack is sadness that a home they love is once more linked with death and destruction. More than once, people announced proudly they are Dewsbury \u201cborn and bred\u201d or launch into a tribute to its quiet streets. \u201cI\u2019ve travelled the world, I can tell you, and there\u2019s no place like Dewsbury,\u201d said Patel, with an enthusiasm undiminished by the gloomy chill of a late June evening. Still, they admit it is struggling with the problems that many of Britain\u2019s non-Muslim towns share, from a weak economy to the blight of drug abuse. A reputation for extremism may only further isolate young people who might be vulnerable to radicalisation. \u201cIf people feel no hope, they may be going,\u201d said another Hanif who did not want to give his last name. An IT specialist who is also an enthusiastic guide to the attractions and history of Dewsbury, from a countryside ice-cream parlour to a seventh-century Christian saint. \u201cParenting is much harder than it ever was before. I think people are losing their connection with their kids and it\u2019s about reconnecting and having that love and time.\u201d Isolation and a lack of opportunities are one of the biggest risk factors for radicalisation, according to Deeyah Khan, a film-maker who was herself a target of extremists. She recently explored what draws young British Muslims to radical groups, in the documentary Jihad \u2013 A British Story. \u201cAttacking racism and discrimination is a very important way to work against radicalisation,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cWe need a broader perspective on what counter-radicalisation means. \u201cSurveillance is an attempt to locate people once they have already become radicalised. We need to enable a societal change that means people don\u2019t feel this sense of emptiness, this lack of hope and dreams. \u201cWe need people to feel at home, to be included, that they are being heard and understood, and that they are part of this society.\u201d Mehrun Mohamed is another Dewsbury mother worried for her children and frustrated by a society apparently unable to see the woman below the headscarf or the men behind the beard. She is part of an inter-faith book club, learned to cycle in Savile Town with no more opposition than an occasional raised eyebrow from more conservative neighbours, and is a valued teacher at a primary school in a mostly white area. She and her husband moved to the United Kingdom from South Africa more than a decade ago, because they were worried about the poisonous legacy of apartheid and wanted to bring their children up in a multicultural, multiracial environment. They chose the UK over the US, where they also had job offers, because they thought it was a more tolerant country, but for the first time are wondering if they have made the right choice. Today they have to contend with a cocktail of fears for their sons about physical attacks in Dewsbury, grooming online and more nebulous but very real concerns that they are internalising the relentless drumbeat of negative reporting about Islam. \u201cMy boys now, if there is an incident anywhere and we don\u2019t know the identity of the perpetrators, the first thing they will say is \u2018just wait a couple of hours and it\u2019s going to turn out that the person is a Muslim\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say we know Muslims are not supposed to do all these things, Islam does not condone these actions, but still they say, wait and see.\u201d For all the fears that Dewsbury has become self-segregated, the senior positions in the local Kirklees council are all still held by non-Muslims, and there are not many senior Muslims in other important local organisations, like the police and National Health Service. \u201cFor the past six years I\u2019ve been working here, I\u2019ve been trying to say \u2018we need role models, they need people in there who look like them, so they can say \u2013 this is where I can be,\u201d said Rehman. \u201cYou have to raise the aspiration of kids. If they believe they are different, that they [as Muslims] are responsible for anything bad that happens, how are we ever going to get them out of this?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
