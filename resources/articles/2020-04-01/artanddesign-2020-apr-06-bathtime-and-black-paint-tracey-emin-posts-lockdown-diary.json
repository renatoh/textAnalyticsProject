The artist has been sharing her life on Instagram with a daily diary of written thoughts, images and short film from her bathroom and studio. The diary was commissioned by White Cube gallery and will be followed by week-long Instagram diaries from other artists including Antony Gormley and Sarah Morris. Susan May, the gallery\u2019s artistic director, said it was a way of staying connected with voices \u201cwho often help us to look at the world in a different way\u201d. \u201cCollective experience is something artists are able to communicate so effectively, and at a time when so many of us are confined in ways beyond our control, art and artists can in some way help us try to make sense of the situation.\u201d Emin\u2019s diary is, typically, rawly autobiographical. On day one there was film of her in the bath with a tray of coffee and hot cross buns and the sound of water pouring in from the taps. She wrote: \u201cToday I would be happy.. today I would celebrate my solitude.. if I were not filled with an over powering sense of fear.. A darkness.. that has made me want to live more than ever.\u201d On day three she wrote: \u201cI\u2019m angry.. but I don\u2019t have the energy to show it.. it\u2019s living inside me, festering, moving around, doing a takeover of my soul.\u201d She shouted at a stranger: \u201cGet between the lines, you fucking idiot.\u201d On other days there was short footage from her studio, where she talked about a painting she had been working on for six months. \u201cIt\u2019s not finished \u2026 it\u2019s never finished.\u201d Day six and Emin was filming her studio at 4.45am, pointing out the sofa on which she sleeps, \u201cif I sleep\u201d. By day seven, \u201cthe last day for now\u201d, she had painted \u201cI wanted you to fuck me so much I couldn\u2019t paint any more\u201d on the artwork. The Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones said the diary was \u201cnot just a trenchant response to these frightening times but a subtle meditation on how art can rise to them\u201d. He added: \u201cIt starts out as an apparently random account of her self-isolation at her Spitalfields home, but becomes a short story about the life of an artist. It\u2019s actually rather optimistic because it shows how to exist in solitude \u2013 inside your feelings, your perceptions, your creativity.\u201d Jones noted that the epic canvas Emin was working on kept getting blacker. \u201cShe can\u2019t stop herself slapping on more black. In a plague year, is there any other colour to paint?\u201d Emin is one of a number of contemporary artists using Instagram during the lockdown. Damien Hirst\u2019s posts are cheerful insights from the studio about the way he works. On Wednesday he wrote \u201cI love paint\u201d and posted a short film from his studio on progress with new enormous cherry blossom paintings. The trunks and branches of the trees he painted were too thick, he said. The solution? Painting blue lines of sky showing through the middle of them. \u201cIt\u2019s building up layers,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t like these until now.\u201d Other artists are giving practical advice. Kara Walker, the American artist whose giant fountain filled Tate Modern\u2019s Turbine Hall until its closure, has been posting #confinementbookclub tips, the latest being Wade Davis\u2019s The Serpent and the Rainbow. The artist Bob and Roberta Smith has been posting regular #StayAtHome art tasks such as, on Friday morning, painting clouds and a statement to a loved one. He said: \u201cI think artists, writers, poets, musicians, composers have a responsibility to keep working and keep doing things. Other people are continuing to work, NHS workers, the corner shop, refuse workers \u2026 so we should. It\u2019s important because it is now that people really understand what culture is all about.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
