John Suffolk, the telecoms firm\u2019s global cybersecurity and privacy officer, said its understanding was that China\u2019s 2017 requirement on companies to cooperate with its intelligence agencies when requested did not apply in its case. \u201cI\u2019m saying the interpretation of what that means, according to our legal advice, doesn\u2019t require Huawei to undertake anything that weakens Huawei\u2019s position in terms of security,\u201d Suffolk told the Commons science and technology committee. The executive fielded a series of hostile questions from the Conservative MP Julian Lewis, who made it clear he did not accept the answers. \u201cI think that\u2019s entirely unbelievable,\u201d Lewis said. Critics of Huawei who say it should not be allowed to supply 5G technology to the UK often cite the 2017 intelligence law, saying it demonstrates China could require the company to spy on British citizens in the future. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and now a Conservative leadership contender, cited the existence of the law in April as an argument to justify \u201ca degree of caution\u201d in using next-generation mobile phone technology supplied by Huawei. Suffolk said the company had sought to clarify its interpretation of the law because \u201cthere was doubt in our minds, the law was unclear [and] there was doubt also in our customers\u2019 minds.\u201d He said Huawei had sought clarification from the Chinese to justify its position, which he suggested applied globally. It was validated by its lawyers and \u201crevalidated\u201d by the international law firm Clifford Chance, he said. Lewis asked Suffolk: \u201cIs it possible to have an independent company the size of Huawei in a one-party, communist, totalitarian state?\u201d Suffolk replied: \u201cI believe we are an independent company.\u201d Huawei, founded by Ren Zhengfei in 1987, is a private company 99% owned by a trade union representing its Chinese employees. The company has repeatedly said the Chinese government has never asked it to spy on its customers. Theresa May was prepared to allow Huawei to supply technology to \u201cnon core\u201d parts of the UK\u2019s 5G network, but concerns elsewhere in cabinet have delayed a final decision until a new Conservative leader is elected. Washington had been conducting a lobbying campaign against Huawei, asking western governments not to use its technology at all in 5G networks and warning the UK that intelligence-sharing could be compromised. But on Monday Donald Trump appeared to contradict some of that argument. Asked on CNBC if Huawei was simply a \u201cchess piece\u201d to be used in wider US-China trade negotiations, the US president said he believed the row could be resolved \u201cas a part of trade negotiations\u201d. Suffolk repeatedly told the MPs that the company aimed to \u201ccomply with the law\u201d \u2013 including surveillance law \u2013 in each of the 170 countries in which it operated. That prompted one MP, Labour\u2019s Graham Stringer, to ask whether Huawei should be compared with IG Farben, a German chemicals giant that manufactured poison gas used in by the Nazis to kill Jews and others in the Holocaust. The Huawei executive said he was not able to respond to that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
