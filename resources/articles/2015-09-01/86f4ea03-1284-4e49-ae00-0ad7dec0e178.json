The traditional depictions of comedy drag characters or transvestite psychopaths are no longer acceptable to writers or audiences. But, repeatedly, the biggest of these transgender roles have gone to non-trans male or female actors, who are then rewarded for their efforts with Oscar nominations and Baftas. But times are changing. This weekend, transgender students enrolled on a groundbreaking acting course that could revolutionise the representation of trans experiences on stage and screen. The course is the first of its kind and is being run by London\u2019s prestigious Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, the training ground for many of Britain\u2019s best known stars, including Sir Laurence Olivier, Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Vanessa Redgrave, Dame Judi Dench and, more recently, Andrew Garfield. \u201cI do think there is a need, even a demand, for it to be more authentically portrayed,\u201d said student Ed Zephyr, 28, a performer from Cambridge. \u201cAnd then the next question for the entertainment industry is: \u2018Where are all the trans actors?\u2019\u201d A few sessions into the new subsidised acting course at Central, the students are enthused. \u201cI have really enjoyed the things that used to terrify me: voice and movement,\u201d said Jason Barker on Saturday. The 44-year-old standup comedian from Bath is enjoying the realisation that his old reasons for hiding his ambitions have disappeared. \u201cI have been interested in drama since school, but always felt uncomfortable. Now I have no excuse to leave, telling myself it was because I am trans \u2013 because here we all are. That makes it a risk, but it is a chance to see if those barriers are really there, or just in my mind.\u201d The course is led by Dr Catherine McNamara, pro-dean at the school and a reader in applied theatre who also runs Gendered Intelligence, a group that advises professional and government bodies on transgender issues. McNamara, who founded the course with Fox Fisher of the trans documentary project My Genderation, believes it will become a beacon for enlightened casting directors and producers. \u201cThere is already a tension around who should play a trans role,\u201d said McNamara, referring to the controversial casting of American actor Jared Leto as Rayon in Dallas Buyers Club, for which he won an Oscar last year. \u201cIt got everyone\u2019s backs up. I have a problem, too, with the actors who come along and ask to spend research time with trans people. Of course, I know many of them want to take challenging work, but there is a discomfort for me about it.\u201d For Zephyr, who has his first fully professional acting role this winter, the course has proved \u201cincredibly useful\u201d. \u201cI didn\u2019t get any training at university, as that was my transitional period,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople tend to need a stable handle on their own identity before they try out others. \u201cIn theory, any actor should be able to play any role, but that assumes an equality that does not exist yet. There is a lot of prejudice,\u201d he added. For Monica Jones, 30, a former model from London, the acting classes have allowed her to cope with a personal history that has taken her deep into depression. \u201cI am very determined and I want to be a standup. The course has given me that fire back again. Performing is not a glamorous business; it is about being self-aware and the course touches on lots of different elements of acting.\u201d One of the students, 20-year-old Harrison Williams from Birmingham, called on casting directors to allow trans talent to take on trans roles. \u201cThis course gives us the chance to learn acting on a level playing field. It is also a good way of making us more visible. \u201cEddie Redmayne came to meet us just before his film came out and he spoke a lot about whether he should be playing the part. He argued at least he was making it a public issue. I understand, but I still think it is exactly like when they used to black up white people for roles 50 years ago.\u201d Zephyr points out that, while an interest in portraying the trans experience is new, the phenomenon is not: it is present in much of Shakespeare. \u201cUsing trans actors gives audiences a new way to look at those works without being contrived, given that no one will ever have the true lens of that era,\u201d he said. Barker calls for the dawn of a time when George Clooney will consider turning a lead male part into a trans role, just as he transformed a male role into a female one for Sandra Bullock this year in his film Our Brand Is Crisis. \u201cRedmayne is an amazing actor and he can basically play any part he wants, but we can\u2019t yet,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
