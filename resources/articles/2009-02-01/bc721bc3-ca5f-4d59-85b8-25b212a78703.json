For batsmen, the ball becomes a balloon and movement automatic. The bowling is as if suspended in time so that Einstein would have had an explanation for it. For almost a month now, since the third umpire offered him a reprieve at Sabina Park when he had made just five runs, he has been in that state, in which runs do not just become a possibility, but rather an inevitability. In Jamaica, he took advantage with 107, a response to a desperate tour of New Zealand where three innings brought him only 20 runs. Then came Antigua's bowling graveyard. Once more he responded with 94, the century discarded with an arrogantly careless flick to midwicket, but then came back second time around with 106 before Stuart Broad and the new ball uprooted his stumps. Yesterday he went better still and, after his sublime 40-run cameo the previous evening, there was a certainty that here was a man not so much driven to score more runs but for whom it was a given, as if all he needed to do was turn up and let his subconscious do the rest. An hour after lunch, a single clipped to mid-on and sprinted skittishly took him to three figures once more and a theatrical, melodramatic celebration in the direction of his team-mates before drinking the applause of the crowd, who were able to abandon partisan feelings and salute batsmanship of the highest class. Shortly afterwards, ears still ringing perhaps, he flashed at Ryan Sidebottom and edged only fractionally wide of the crackerjack Paul Collingwood in the gulley and on to the boundary. As the bowler kicked the ground in frustration and stomped his way back to his mark, Sarwan was summoned for mid-pitch parley with his Guyanese compatriot Shivnarine Chanderpaul. \"Look at the board, my friend,\" he seemed to say. \"The job is not yet half done. There is more batting to do. Don't throw this one away.\" It would have been sound advice, for Sarwan has long been seen as a talented underachiever. Yesterday's was his 14th Test century, but only once, when he filled his boots and made 261 against Bangladesh, had he progressed beyond 139. It is as if the century has been the end itself rather than a means to an end, a milestone to be passed on a longer journey elsewhere. Next ball from Sidebottom, similar in line and length to the previous, was flagged by with exaggerated disdain. The lesson had been absorbed: he was relentless, unflagging until the close. The small blemish in an innings otherwise free of them had a resonance in the assessment of Duncan Fletcher earlier in the week. Sarwan, he noted, tends to play around his front pad early in an innings, but consequently can be prolific through midwicket. Thus, set a field accordingly, with short midwickets, and challenge this stroke, depriving him at the same time of what Fletcher calls his \"release\" shot, the rapier cut that he waits for and executes so wickedly. There were plans in place but the ball did not swing for Sidebottom, nor Anderson, the two who might have been able to bowl to such a strategy. And the pitch is sublime, with pace and good, even bounce to encourage strokes. Against this, Andrew Strauss, even with a lead of around 500, felt compelled to abandon thoughts of setting orthodox fields, and instead fiddled about like Wicked Uncle Ernie. Fletcher's other dictum, Plan B, is to begin a game of patience outside off stump, while trying to drag him forward, thus, at one and the same time starving him of his most prolific cut shot. Still, that single Sidebottom moment apart, it disturbed not Sarwan, who threaded his drives precisely and continued to cut anyway when given a quarter chance, the shot flayed from a solid base that is neither front nor back foot, in the manner that the great Kiwi batsman Glenn Turner once employed. On the second new ball, due and taken shortly after tea, perhaps rested the outcome of the match and England's chances of winning the series. It required a duff decision by Russell Tiffin, reinforced by the television overlord Daryl Harper, to get rid of Chanderpaul and an equally duff double up with Aleem Dar to send Brendan Nash packing on appealing the appeal. It is like refried chips. The West Indies coach John Dyson promptly disappeared for discussions with the match referee Alan Hurst. The price of mahi-mahi would not have come into it. Frankly, either the appeal system is an ass or Harper is. The smart money would be on both."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
