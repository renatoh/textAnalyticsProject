Those teams include Saha's current employer Everton, who entertain United in the early kick-off on Saturday and, before that, the League Two club Aldershot Town, who host them in the Carling Cup on Tuesday night after winning 5-2 at Dagenham &amp; Redbridge on Saturday. Saha scored Everton's second goal in their 3-1 win at Fulham on Sunday but the events in Manchester, where City's 6-1 mauling of their neighbours served as a statement of title-winning intent, providing as much of a talking point. Everton's immediate focus is on their Carling Cup tie against Chelsea at Goodison on Wednesday, in which both teams will be aiming to reach the quarter-finals. United's visit comes at the end of what is looking like it might be a tough week for the Merseyside club. Saha, meanwhile, has reflected on whether it may be a good time to face Ferguson's team. \"Not really, no,\" he said. \"It's may be a bad time. I know the manager and he will surely push them to do well and ask a lot of them. And so will the fans. When you are losing that many goals against your rival, it is not good.\" The Frenchman joined United from Fulham in January 2004 and in his four and a half seasons there averaged a goal in every three appearances. He was undermined, though, by a succession of injuries which frustrated him and the supporters. Saha also witnessed the manager's methods at close quarters and it is fair to say that he did not enjoy one particular aspect of the Scot's repertoire. \"No, I don't miss the hairdryer,\" he said with a smile. However Jack Rodwell, who scored Everton's third goal at Craven Cottage, believes that they can exploit the shock that United have suffered to their system. \"It's never a good time to play United but they've come off a bad defeat so hopefully their confidence isn't too great and ours will be higher after a win against Chelsea,\" the midfielder said. Everton lost 3-1 at Chelsea in the Premier League on the Saturday before last but Rodwell claimed that the home game under lights will be a different proposition. \"In night games at Goodison the fans are amazing, the atmosphere is brilliant and it's a very hostile place to come to,\" he said. \"I'm sure it will be a different game. \"We've had a really hard run and now we've got Chelsea and Manchester United, but you have to play these teams at some point. Hopefully we can drag something out of them. We've been to Chelsea and Man City away and we haven't managed to get the results, so hopefully we can turn it round on Wednesday. With both games being at home now, that could make a difference.\" United, meanwhile, have confirmed on Monday that Javier Hern\u00e1ndez has signed a new five-year contract."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
