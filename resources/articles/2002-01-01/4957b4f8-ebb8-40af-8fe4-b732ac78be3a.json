Family visits are not holidays; it's hard work remembering everyone's name, eating everyone's food, and giving them money. Although I have all the Jamaican souvenirs I need, I still wanted to taste Jamaica as a tourist. 'You must go to Port Antonio,' the Air Jamaica stewardess said as I left the plane. I head for Jake's on the south coast. It doesn't pretend to be a five-star hotel, it doesn't cut you off from the world outside, and the staff are very helpful indeed. Every time I sit down to eat, the chef promptly arrives to discuss the vegan possibilities. It's like a small village - a creative space where filmmakers, painters and musicians hang out, quietly considering future projects. They put on plays and poetry readings here, and you can get the sun without feeling that you're in a posing competition. 'I want to meet Jake,' I tell the receptionist who reminds me of an angel I once met in Milton Keynes. 'Jake flew away,' she says quite heavenly. 'He needed to explore, he had to diversify, he had to go lose his virginity. We think he's gone to Port Antonio.' It turns out that Jake's a parrot and the real owners are the filmmaker Perry Henzell and Sally Henzell, a local historian. I got spiritual at Jake's. The Grand Lido in Negril is inclusive, exclusive and big. Set in 22 acres, it has its own beach, its own jungle and a 200-year-old cotton tree; even the mosquitoes live at the top of the food chain. I can't swim, I don't do water sports and I hate beaches, so I spend a lot of time in the restaurants testing vegan dishes. One restaurant insists on formal dress so I don't make it there; the last time I wore a jacket was in court. At a beach party, I see a limbo dancer for the first time in my life. I've never seen limbo dancing in Kingston; I've not heard of great limbo dancers fighting against slavery; my mother never limbo danced, she went to church. I'm approached by a large American man with a small American woman. 'Are you with the band?' he asks. 'I love your dreadlocks,' she says. 'No,' I say, 'and I love my dreadlocks too.' They praise my cute English accent and tell me that Port Antonio's awesome. Later that evening, a woman who reminds me of Miss Sweden 1996 asks if she can see my arts and crafts. Watching happy couples going about their loving I wander lonely as a shroud. To compensate, I dine with mem bers of staff, but I do actually find a couple from Tennessee with whom I become quite friendly. As other American couples receive 'reggae dancing lesson', Rick and Vera assure me that not all Americans are like that. A friend in a high place arranges for my safe passage into Hedonism 2, Grand Lido's outrageous sister next door. I watch astonished as women of all shapes strip and tease the piano player. The dance floor is even more way out, reminding me of all the rap videos I have ever seen rolled into one. I try to picture these people at work; are they teachers, bankers, computer programmers and flower arrangers? I feel even lonelier here. And don't believe the rumours: I did n't dance with a naked 60-year-old; it was a bloke from Tottenham who looks like me. One day, I visit friends in Negril town. There, a Rasta woman who reminds me that there is a god gives me the best vegan stew I've encountered for decades. Negril has changed quite a bit since the last time I was there; it knows that tourism is the hand that feeds it. Craft shops have become email caf\u00e9s, Yardies deal in some heavy mosquito repellents. I come across Rasta artisans who I met when I was there 13 years ago, most of whom congratulate me on my (so-called) fame and ask me if they can join my band. In Mandeville, I check into the Astra Country Inn Hotel. Among other things, the manager, Diana McIntyre-Pike, is president of the Caribbean Chapter of Peace Through Tourism, chairwoman of the Rural and Community-based Tourism network, spokeswoman for the Returned Residents' Association, and an important mover in the Sustainable Communities Foundation. Mandeville has no formal museum but it does have many 'home museums' where you see the town's history through the history of its residents. Diana keeps talking about 'community tourism'. She can set you up with a family, on a farm, get you married in a sustainable forest, or simply send you to another hotel. Hotels work together here, tourists blend in and workers in the tourist industry don't put on strange American accents. At dinner with Diana and her friends, who include hotel managers, an ex-military man, a journalist and a structural engineer who reminded me of my Uncle Astley, we talk about the state of Jamaican roads, US military action in Afghanistan, Hedonism 2, Jesus Christ, Diana, Princess of Wales, the Lebanese war, Queen Beatrix of the Nether lands and the versatility of the cassava plant. But the big topic is tourism in Jamaica. 'So how do you and your British friends see Jamaica?' I am asked. I give them a piece of my mind. 'It's very nice,' I say, smiling at the ex-military man. We agree that the British media's portrayal of Jamaica gives the impression that Jamaicans have more guns than sense, and that the country has problems but that it has many faces. 'The foreign media should make more of an effort to show this,' I'm told, then I am given the job of reminding the world media of their responsibilities. The big event is the annual dinner of the Returned Residents' Association. There are hundreds of returnees, all dressed as if they're going to church. 'You will perform soon,' I am told by Diana as she leaves to sit between the mayor and the superintendent of police. These are the people who helped to build Britain but could not get Jamaica off their minds; now back in their place of birth, they cannot get Britain off their minds. Diana introduces me with great pride. She calls me Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, referring to my honorary degrees, and tells the crowd that I will save the planet and that I'm the best poet in the world. I move towards the stage wondering what happened to my holiday. They shout encouraging noises at me and I feel like a boxer who has returned home as world heavyweight champion. I tell them how impressed I am with the work they've done, I thank them for paving the way for us in Britain, and then I perform. It feels like Handsworth, but we all know that as we travel home we won't encounter the BNP, no one will call us niggers or demand our passports. Questions about culture and identity are still relevant, though. I'm on television and Diana's apologising for working me so hard, but she still has one more trip for me. At her house, I meet her extended family and tell them my life story in 15 minutes. I'm told to perform again and reminded that in the Caribbean a poet should be prepared to perform anywhere. They clap for me and then I'm given a history lesson I will never forget. This is a home museum, a collection of family memorabilia, paintings and photographs that go back generations, even to their distant Scottish relatives. Where there are no photos or paintings, I'm given the oral history. I leave uplifted, saying 'community tourism' and 'organic family farming' every time I speak. But these are not new-age hippies. The people behind this movement are, on average, 60 years old, they are Christians and they want me to tell the world that tourism doesn't have to mean beaches and large hotels; it can mean villages, farms and staying with someone who reminds me of my mother. I just can't resist visiting my family. My cousin Verna hugs me so tight I think I won't make it home. My contemporaries all look much older than me; they congratulate me on my young looks and caress my dreadlocks. My grandmother has died, my grandfather now has trouble seeing and hearing. 'Look,' he says pointing over my shoulder, 'your grandmother's over there.' I shiver, knowing that Jamaican ghosts do turn up in the middle of the day expecting lunch. I turn around slowly, and there, next to the kitchen where she had spent most of her life, is my grandmother's grave. It's spooky. The neighbours all look like me, and I wonder what kind of person I would have been if my mother did not get on that ship. My relatives still want to follow me back to London. 'London is not heaven,' I tell them. 'It's polluted, crowded, expensive and nobody talks to you because they're too busy talking to others on their mobile phones.' My cousin Iva pulls out a phone from his pocket. 'Me have one here,' he says, 'but me can't afford de cards.' My grandfather whispers in my ear: 'The girls in Port Antonio taste nice, boy' as he casually empties my wallet. 'Goodbye,' I shout in his ear. 'Keep sending money,' he replies. As I leave, I look back like they do in films and smile as my grandfather waves in the wrong direction, and I wonder if I'll ever see him alive again. It's my last night and I'm back at Jake's checking a heavy-duty play about rape, bribery and prostitution. The actors haven't watered down their accents so I translate for a dentist from North Carolina, but in the interval there it is again, bloody limbo dancing and, I wonder, do they limbo dance in Port Antonio?
