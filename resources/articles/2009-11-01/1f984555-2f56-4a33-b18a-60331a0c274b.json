She was also in marvellous voice, her rich blend of colours matching the emotional restraint of Pleurez, Pleurez Mes Yeux from Massenet's Le Cid perfectly. Her other major solo, Morro from Verdi's A Masked Ball, was a little heavy for her lyric soprano but imaginatively shaped and addressed with dramatic conviction. She chose her vocal partner for the evening astutely. The Romanian Marius Manea has a perfectly pleasant tenor and a reasonable technique, but nothing about him was ever going to outclass Gheorghiu on form. After a decent Salut! Demeure from Faust, including a healthy \u2013 though scarcely show-stopping \u2013 top C, he sang the doleful tenor romance from Verdi's Luisa Miller almost consistently flat. The pair's duets in the first half went well. Gheorghiu's revisiting of Traviata and L'Elisir \u2013 operas she has performed umpteen times \u2013 gave her the opportunity for some concert acting, and her personality shone through. She lost her place, though, in the Cherry Duet from Mascagni's L'Amico Fritz, her recording of which \u2013 partnering her soon-to-be ex-husband Roberto Alagna \u2013 has just been released. Conductor Ion Marin restarted it after a tiny pause, though without telling the orchestra exactly from where, which meant they filtered gradually back in rather than relaunching together. His conducting of the evening's orchestral fillers \u2013 the usual hackneyed assortment trotted out on such occasions \u2013 was at best tepid. But Gheorghiu's finesse and sense of style triumphed in her finest items, including a spellbinding O Mio Babbino Caro as her first encore."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
