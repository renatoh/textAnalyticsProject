The bill, put forward by Liberal-National backbencher Warren Entsch and co-sponsored by Labor\u2019s Terri Butler, is expected to be introduced on Monday morning. But the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, has acknowledged the bill will never see the light of day. \u201cI don\u2019t think the vote will come on for this bill,\u201d Dutton told Channel Nine on Sunday. \u201cThere\u2019s a process that needs to be gone through in relation to private member\u2019s bills and the government\u2019s made its position clear and that is we don\u2019t want to deal with this bill now.\u201d Labor criticised the move. \u201cThe reason that Warren Entsch\u2019s bill won\u2019t come on is because the prime minister [Tony Abbott] is stopping it coming on,\u201d the deputy opposition leader, Tanya Plibersek, told Channel Nine. A number of Liberal backbenchers have threatened to cross the floor if the matter does come to a vote. Abbott said that while they are entitled to do so, he \u201cwould be disappointed if they went against the party position\u201d. The issue of same-sex marriage has dominated headlines since the Coalition decided to reject a free vote on the matter on Tuesday. More than 90 MPs spoke on the subject, with the vast majority rejecting a free vote. Abbott has pledged to let voters decide on the issue through a public vote, but on Sunday would not be drawn on whether he preferred a plebiscite or a referendum on the matter. \u201cThe important thing is that it will be a people\u2019s decision \u2013 that\u2019s the point,\u201d he told reporters in Brisbane. The prime minister ruled out holding a public vote on the same day as the next federal election. \u201cI think the people should be able to consider this in its own right,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cMillions of people in our community have strong views one way or another on this and why shouldn\u2019t we be able to debate this and decide this in its own right without being distracted by the sorts of arguments which you inevitably get during an election campaign?\u201d Shortly after Abbott\u2019s press conference, the communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, tweeted a link to his blog. In it, he set out why he thought a plebiscite should be held before the next election. \u201cMy own view for what it is worth is that it would be better if same-sex marriage were not a contentious issue at the next election \u2013 there are sincere, conscientious differences of opinion throughout the community and on both sides of the political divide and issues like this are better dealt with outside of the frenzied hurly burly of an election campaign,\u201d Turnbull wrote. \u201cImportant though the matter is, every day talking about same-sex marriage will distract from the Coalition\u2019s core messages.\u201d The debate about whether to hold a referendum or a non-binding plebiscite on same-sex marriage has revealed bitter divisions within the Liberal party, with the attorney general, George Brandis, being the latest to throw a salvo in the very public spat. On Sunday Brandis told Sky News the government needed to settle on a model once and for all. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it will happen at the cabinet meeting scheduled for tomorrow, but I do agree and expect that this is a decision that the government should make very soon,\u201d he said. Opponents of same-sex marriage are pushing for a referendum, which requires a higher threshold to pass. Brandis has shot down suggestions of a referendum, saying it is unnecessary because the constitution does not define marriage and therefore does not require a referendum to be changed, but he is not opposed to taking the matter to the people. \u201cI\u2019m satisfied with what we\u2019ve achieved as long as there is a plebiscite,\u201d he said. \u201cI am perfectly happy with that outcome.\u201d He wants a plebiscite to be compulsory, acknowledging that voters will not appreciate having to go to the polls straight after a federal election. \u201cI can see the desirability of having the matter out of the way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe public will be a little weary, I think, of being taken to the ballot box twice in 12 months.\u201d But the attorney general said he was \u201cdisinclined\u201d to pair the same-sex marriage vote with a referendum on recognising Indigenous Australians in the constitution, which he said had an \u201cemotional significance\u201d for society. The justice minister, Michael Keenan, would not be drawn on what model he would prefer but said last week\u2019s joint party meeting meeting signalled the end of the matter. \u201cSame-sex marriage has taken up a lot of oxygen,\u201d he told the conservative commentator, Andrew Bolt, on Sunday. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find when we return to parliament tomorrow that the government will continue to focus on the things that we think are important for the future of Australia.\u201d The debate about same-sex marriage has seen cabinet ministers openly attack each other and has once again put the spotlight on Abbott\u2019s leadership. Leaks of the prime minister\u2019s text messages, as reported by News Corp on Sunday, show Abbott knew the backbencher and same-sex marriage advocate Warren Entsch would raise the matter on Tuesday morning. Abbott reportedly told the party room that he did not know that the question of a free vote on same-sex marriage would be brought up. \u201cAll I am going to say is there was nothing I did he didn\u2019t know about,\u2019\u2019 Entsch told News Corp. Moderates in the Liberal party have warned that same-sex marriage will overshadow the government\u2019s policy messages and could result in voter backlash. The leader of the Victorian branch of the Liberal party, Matthew Guy, criticised the federal branch\u2019s decision to reject a free vote, warning that it is \u201cpoisoning the well of good will for all other elected politicians in the country\u201d. The Victorian Liberal powerbroker, Michael Kroger, has denied there is a rift between him and Abbott\u2019s chief of staff, Peta Credlin, after reports he had slapped down questions on why Guy had made such scathing comments. Kroger rejected suggestions the text message interchange with Credlin showed that party members were openly contemptuous of the prime minister\u2019s office. \u201cIs there an argument with Peta? No,\u201d Kroger told Bolt. \u201cI\u2019m good friends with her. She sent me texts asking why the state leaders are getting involved in a national issue. I said Matthew has a very strong view about it.\u201d Brandis also denied that Abbott\u2019s leadership had been weakened by the bruising internal debate about same-sex marriage being played out in the public arena. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a leadership question. We resolved that in February and I don\u2019t expect it to re-emerge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a boisterous week, there\u2019s no doubt about that, but the suggestion of disarray is, with all due respect, nonsense.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
