That\u2019s probably why the term \u201cto Meghan Markle\u201d was created this week: \u201cMeghan Markle, a verb, past tense - Meghan Markled: to value yourself and your mental health enough to up and leave a room/ situation/ environment in which your authentic self is not welcomed or wanted.\u201d Why shouldn\u2019t a word be made for a person who not only realizes when love is not returned, but when to get the hell out? If you aspire to Meghan Markle it in 2020, here\u2019s how. Meghan Markling when going out To \u201cMeghan Markle it\u201d is an ode to self-respect, a sermon to owning one\u2019s own boundaries, especially when it involves alcohol. Do say: \u201cMan, when I go out tonight, I am so going to Meghan Markle it,\u201d before going home early, getting eight hours sleep and not texting your ex. Don\u2019t say: \u201cI don\u2019t care about Meghan Markling it, I am going to dance on a table before texting my ex with some Beyonc\u00e9 lyrics.\u201d Meghan Markling in relationships On the matter of exes: the next time you get sent a text saying \u201cU up?\u201d at 3am from a deadbeat who has ignored you for weeks, you need to Meghan Markle it. Obviously most people can\u2019t just move to Canada to become an uber-influencer. But you could consider whether said love interest really respects you, and if not, how to leave them behind. Do say: \u201cI totally Meghan Markled my ex last night and never returned his texts.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cI\u2019m not going to Meghan Markle this time: they didn\u2019t get back to my last 30 calls, but I think they have been really busy, to be fair?\u201d Meghan Markling it at work This one is slightly counterintuitive, because part of Harry and Meghan\u2019s problem with royalty was that they didn\u2019t have to work. But for the rest of us, Meghan Markling it at work looks like understanding what an asset you are, and leaving a company when that is not appreciated. Do say: \u201cI\u2019m considering Meghan Markling: they haven\u2019t given me a raise in two years, and I\u2019d have better options working as an Instagram influencer than staying in this loveless work marriage.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cI\u2019ll Meghan Markle it when I finally have time to update my LinkedIn, which is never.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
