The midfielder had just completed Wolves\u2019 first contact training session in more than two months on Thursday when news broke that his team could return to match action on the weekend starting 19 June. Neves can already envisage repeating his pre-match routine. \u201cColdplay are my favourite band and that\u2019s the kind of music I always listen to before a game,\u201d the 23-year-old said. \u201cNormally the last song I listen to before I take off my headphones is Fix You. I like the words and it helps me to get concentrated for the match.\u201d That seems a rather plaintive tune to use as stimulus for a Premier League showdown, but the lyrics are about resisting despair, carrying on despite heartache. So maybe it will sound particularly fitting when the season resumes in a country still tormented by Covid-19. Safety permitting, Neves believes the return of football will help to provide a dose of light relief. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to have back the sensations of football, the emotions, the goals, everything. It\u2019s really important for football to come back.\u201d On Thursday Neves and his teammates took a major step towards that return. \u201cWe are really excited \u2013 even more so after that training session because we could finally play proper football. So far we had only trained individually or in small groups without contact.\u201d The manager, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, had to be vigilant to ensure a combination of rustiness and enthusiasm did not lead to clumsy tackles. \u201cThe gaffer made sure everything would go right in the first training session,\u201d Neves said. \u201cPeople were excited but he made sure they just focused on playing football. We still have time to compete and get back that [competitive] feeling. For now the most important thing is to get back the sensations of the team, the lines of play and the tactics.\u201d Wolves have a lot to play for when the season resumes. They were sixth in the table when play was suspended and were also looking good in the Europa League, having scored an away goal while drawing the first leg of their last-16 tie at Olympiakos. Owing to coronavirus that match was played behind closed doors, offering Wolves an experience of what the atmosphere will be like when the Premier League returns in empty stadiums. \u201cIt is really strange, you don\u2019t have the adrenaline of the fans,\u201d Neves said. \u201cWe are used to playing in loud places, but unfortunately the situation is bad and we don\u2019t know when things will get back to normal so we just have to get used to it. \u201cThe warmup is the most important part for getting used to the [empty] stadium because it is quiet and you need to put your head in the game. We used the warmup to motivate us so that when the game started we didn\u2019t think about [the silence].\u201d Other thoughts Neves says he and his fellow players are good at banishing are the ones about a thrilling Wolves team being picked apart whenever transfer activity is reignited. The one downside of their success as far as their fans are concerned is that many of their players have attracted the attention of more established powers. Neves is said to be coveted by Manchester City and many others. \u201cThere has always been speculation since I\u2019ve got here about our team,\u201d says the player whose arrival at Molineux in 2017 was a big factor in the club\u2019s triumphant drive for promotion from the Championship. \u201cBut we don\u2019t think about it. We want to be together for as much time as we can but it\u2019s football, the speculation will always be there. Our job is to play and leave this for the people who need to take care of it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
