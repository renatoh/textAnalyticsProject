But Bremer, who looks reborn now having made just six league appearances across the previous two seasons thanks to a nasty leg break, punished the visiting team. \u201cI don\u2019t think any time would be right to go, whether the club\u2019s decision or my decision, whether it was in season or out of season,\u201d said Cushing. \u201cI think I\u2019d always be heartbroken to leave this team. It\u2019s been such a huge part of my life. It\u2019s the right time now for some reasons, it\u2019s not the perfect time but I trust this club and the people around it. \u201cI won the Continental Cup on the day my daughter was born and didn\u2019t go to the birth because this team means so much to me. My son was born in the car in 2014 two days before we started pre-season with this team and my wife went off with the baby and I did pre-season and went to La Manga and didn\u2019t take paternity. I\u2019m so close to the team, it\u2019s been such a huge part of my life but I don\u2019t define this team.\u201d City, though, did not take long to get an assured footing in the game with England\u2019s Georgia Stanway full of energy up front alongside a resurgent Bremer. In the sweeping rain the momentum was with City and on 18 minutes they had the breakthrough. Janine Beckie sent a crossfield pass to Lauren Hemp who squared to Caroline Weir. Tina Korpela got her body in front of the ball but Bremer was able to poke it over the line, much to the frustration of the goalkeeper, who screamed in vain at the referee, Amy Fearn, for handball. With City in the ascendancy Everton\u2019s Gabby George helped keep their deficit to one. First she blocked from Bremer after the German danced into the box with stepovers aplenty, then she threw herself in front of Stanway after Weir had slid her clean through. Everton, in their salmon-coloured shirts, were swimming upstream. In the second half and amid chants of \u201cThere\u2019s only one Nick Cushing\u201d, Bremer grabbed her second, and ninth league goal of the season. Hemp nicked the ball on the left and played it to the German forward who, in acres of space, took a touch and powered her strike into the top corner. Bonner extended the home team\u2019s lead. With Bremer missing Walsh\u2019s free-kick Bonner met it at the far post and scrambled it past Ellie Roebuck. A late Stanway own goal did so little to dampen the mood that the stadium announcer did not even see fit to mention it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
