After nearly two decades as a professional footballer the midfielder has just swapped Newcastle for Bolton, a club that could be straight out of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Like all Sam Allardyce's recruits Speed has already been assessed by the club's psychological profiler - there is a story doing the rounds at the Reebok that one potential summer signing was vetoed because his psychological profile did not fit the Bolton blueprint - sat through hours of motivational videos and had his every physiological function monitored by Allardyce's army of sports scientists. Bolton's doctor of oriental medicine may have been dispensed with but laptops remain de rigueur coaching accessories for Allardyce's staff and Speed is still blinking in amazement. \"It's all a bit different from Newcastle and all very thorough,\" said the Wales captain, who is approaching his 35th birthday and has played a record 414 Premiership games - for Leeds, Everton and Newcastle. \"I've never even worked with a psychologist before but I'm not too old to open my eyes and take new things on board. Training is extremely intense here and we work most afternoons as well as mornings. \"But doing things like Tai Chi is brilliant and, if everything Sam tries makes us just half a per cent better on the pitch, it will be fully worthwhile. Bolton finished eighth in the Premiership last season and reached the League Cup final, so getting eighth again is the minimum we are looking to achieve this time.\" Until a few weeks ago Speed's aim had been to help Newcastle finish a minimum of fourth but then came the bombshell that Leeds wanted to sign Speed and Sir Bobby Robson was happy for him to talk to his old club. Speed, who has signed a two-year contract with Bolton, did not want to drop out of the Premiership and rebuffed Leeds but he knew his six-year Tyneside sojourn was effectively over. \"I didn't want to leave but I knew my time was up, that I had no future there,\" explained a man who, like the similarly departed Rob Lee and Nolberto Solano, was once hailed by Robson as \"part of my blue-chip brigade\". The initial hurt was tinged with puzzlement. \"The strange thing was I just hadn't seen it coming,\" admitted Speed, who still speaks to Alan Shearer, one of his closest friends, several times a week. \"I'd played every game last season, more than any other Newcastle player, and I never imagined I wouldn't be staying. But towards the end the manager and the chairman were totally straight up front with me and we parted on good terms.\" Even so, did Speed concur with the Tyneside conspiracy theorists who suspect his sale was part of a wider plan to weaken Shearer's dressing-room power base? \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" he said, stone-walling before allowing himself a mischievous giggle. \"There's no hard-luck stories in the Premiership and I don't know where Newcastle will finish this season; I don't want to comment on that but I do know their supporters deserve some success. I've so many friends up there and no one would be more delighted than me if they won something.\" A source of delight for the new Boltonian has been the realisation that he is far from the senior citizen among Allardyce's squad. \"It makes a nice change not to be the oldest; there's three or four older than me here.\" They include his fellow newcomers Les Ferdinand, 37, and Fernando Hierro, 36, who spent last season in Qatar after being moved on by Real Madrid. Evidently swayed by the Welshman's comparative youth Allardyce is planning to turn back the clock and reinvent Speed as the attacking midfielder he was before Robson asked him to sit in front of Newcastle's defence. \"We've got Iv\u00e1n Campo sitting in that deep position I had in the latter years at Newcastle so, with the manager also preferring to play 4-3-3, he's asked me if I'd play a new role, get forward a lot more and hopefully score a few goals,\" said Speed. \"I don't want to put too much pressure on myself but it's something I used to do a lot earlier in my career and I still feel fit enough to get myself into the box and try and score my share.\" Remarkably the longest Speed has been sidelined with injuries during his near 20-year career is two six-week stints, one after suffering a broken cheekbone and the other following a double-hernia operation. \"I do go out and enjoy myself but I've also always looked after myself. Luck plays a part but, as I've got older, I've done absolutely everything I can to avoid getting muscular injuries which, in your 30s, take time to recover from,\" explained a man who regularly supplemented Newcastle's official training regime with runs and cycle rides through the Northumberland countryside. Small wonder Speed's psychological profile apparently made such pleasant reading for his new manager. Or, as Allardyce translated it into layman's terms: \"Gary is one of those rare players you know you can hang your hat on.\" New Age Trotters: analysing the Allardyce system Psychological profiler Assesses all potential new recruits before signing and compiles a profile enabling Allardyce to know how best to man-manage individuals and how they are likely to react to differing situations. Tai Chi Bolton's doctor of Oriental medicine has been dispensed with for this season but eastern influences remain. Players seem to particularly enjoy Tai Chi, claiming it helps them control anger, channel energy in a positive fashion and is a good way of relaxing while performing beneficial muscle stretches. Motorised toilet seat racing By way of team bonding Allardyce has been known to take his squad to the Lake District for mini-breaks where racing down a fell side on specially motorised toilet seats is de rigueur . Fitness training Allardyce insists the Premiership \"is the most physically demanding league in the world\" and fitness experts supplement training with a tough regimen that incorporates separate assessments and tailor-made programmes for individual players. Prozone You cannot cheat the computerised information that, with detailed analysis of a filmed match, tells Bolton's staff exactly how far each player has run during a game, how many positive passes they have made, how many tackles they have shirked etc. Players love it or loathe it, but it is regarded as an invaluable aid as many will not admit to their faults until confronted with them on the Prozone screen. Helps Allardyce shape his tactics and select personnel. Laptops Obligatory tools for Bolton staff. Allardyce spends hours surfing the internet looking for new sports science innovations and takes a keen interest in training developments in other sports. All data on Bolton players is logged on computer so coaches can call up information at touch of a button. Staff regularly communicate my email. Motivational videos Bolton players probably spend more time watching these than sitting through The Tweenies with their toddlers. Nutritionist Devises specific diets for individuals and advises Allardyce on how players should best ensure they benefit from maximum energy during a match. Chinese meals A more old-fashioned aid; Allardyce is not averse to bolstering harmony during a night out with his squad who are, as a special treat, permitted to rehydrate with lager."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
