Andy Bull, in his Spin column, has put this in proper perspective quite beautifully, to which I would merely like to add that on the back of a turnaround to match that which England managed after their Headingley debacle last year, Salman Butt \u2013 the impressive, dignified and young Pakistan captain \u2013 should now be given long-term backing as worthy efforts are made to reintegrate his side into the global scheme of things. The response to England losing appears to have been typically over-reactive. But then we tend not to do things in half measures and it is generally easier, not to say more parochial, to criticise and find fault with your own team than to heap praise on the opposition (no matter that England, while a good and steadily improving side, are nonetheless far from the standards of the great Australia or West Indies sides of the modern era). Our expectation reflects a distorted sense of entitlement. In sports journalism, though, there tends to be no middle ground, no grey area. Always we have to have heroes or zeroes. That way, at least, lies debate. Yet already the match is being seen not in the context of a four-Test series which stands at 2\u20131 with one to play, but as a pointer to the forthcoming Ashes. Suddenly, on the back of some sleight\u2013of\u2013hand bowling from Pakistan, brilliant in these English conditions, comes the extrapolation that much the same fate awaits England in Australia this winter. This is nonsense. Andrew Strauss has been dismissed by the left arm Mohammad Amir on a continual basis, therefore, goes the simplistic assessment, he has a weakness against left-arm pace bowling and as such, should he come up against Mitchell Johnson and Doug Bollinger, is toast. Actually though, he has proved fallible against a new Duke ball, propelled by a bowler who has swung the ball away considerably in the prevailing conditions this summer. Johnson and Bollinger might provide a challenge but on their pitches, with a different ball, it is not going to be this one. And if it was, and the ball somehow hooped around, then it would be England who were much the better suited to exploit it. England will set off for Australia at the start of November with a strong chance not just of retaining the Ashes, but also of winning the series. The collapses, in the most bowler-friendly conditions seen in this country for years, do not look clever, but no batsman can truly have felt in command all summer. Let us not forget that at Headingley, Australia collapsed even more ignominiously, against a weaker attack than Pakistan's at The Oval, yet there is no suggestion that they will be equally vulnerable in a few months' time. Ricky Ponting may be talking a good game, but then he has to, and always in response to press conference questions that are so leading they would make a high court judge apoplectic. He knows that, as with last summer, these are two good but by no means exceptional sides, well matched, and competitive. Four years ago it would not have made a difference who was captain of England, or whether their strategy was different, the outcome would have been much the same. The reality is that Strauss has a resilient group of players, well managed and led, if a little less resourcefully on the field than they might be at times. In batting terms they have between them a total of 74 Test centuries, fairly evenly spread with the exception of the relatively new batsmen in Jonathan Trott and Eoin Morgan, while Matt Prior is now a wicketkeeper-batsman of pedigree, a dangerous batsman at No7 (which, quite rightly, is where he will bat in the first Test, although the strategy will be according to venue and conditions, rather than set in stone). The pace bowling will need to adjust but Jimmy Anderson is capable of considerably more now than when he was last in Australia, at a time when his game was in crisis, while Stuart Broad and Steve Finn have the physical attributes for conditions abroad. England like tall bowlers: it is why Chris Tremlett may gain a place over Tim Bresnan. And in Ajmal Shahzad they have a fast, skiddy reverse-swing bowler in the mould of Simon Jones. Graeme Swann, we need no reminding, is the world's leading spin bowler and in the bowling coach David Saker they have someone whose knowledge of Australian conditions, in particular the lengths to bowl, is second to none. No England side has had the capability to field as well as these players. These qualities do not disappear overnight simply because the opposition enjoy their well deserved time in the sun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
