Other senior figures, including Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, were criticized for hedging their responses, condemning the president without mentioning Omar\u2019s name. Some declared or likely 2020 contenders, including former Vice-President Joe Biden and New Jersey senator Cory Booker, did not tweet any comment in the 24 hours that followed Trump\u2019s tweet on Friday evening of a video which spliced footage from the September 11 terror attacks with edited remarks by Omar, accusing the politician of dismissing the seriousness of the attacks. Trump was himself following Fox News commentators and Republican politicians who have repeatedly suggested that Omar, a black Muslim women who wears a hijab, is un-American and un-patriotic, and even that her religious beliefs are \u201cantithetical to the United States constitution\u201d. Here\u2019s a look at how Democratic presidential candidates responded on Friday and Saturday: First few hours The first public responses to Trump\u2019s attack came from Michigan congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, the other Muslim woman in Congress, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the freshman congresswoman from New York, a rising progressive star. Both called on other Democrats to speak out. Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, a frontrunner in the 2020 race, released a statement within three hours, praising Omar\u2019s leadership and calling attacks against her \u201cdangerous\u201d. Minutes later, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren tweeted an even more strongly worded response, accusing the president of \u201cinciting violence against at sitting congresswoman\u201d and arguing that \u201cany elected leader who refuses to condemn it\u201d shares responsibility for the incitement. Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington State who is focusing his presidential campaign on the risk of climate change, also responded quickly: Friday night California congressman Eric Swalwell, who has entered the 2020 race with a focus on ending gun violence, responded to Trump by writing \u201cWe WILL forget you\u201d and talking about how many buildings would be named after Trump in the future. Former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke shared a general condemnation of Trump\u2019s Islamophobia, without mentioning Omar\u2019s name. On Saturday, he did so. South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg tweeted a thread of comments criticizing Trump\u2019s remarks, talking about the danger of Islamophobia and referencing his own military service in Afghanistan. Criticized for not mentioning Omar\u2019s name in his first tweet, he referenced her directly later in the thread, in a tweet that posted about 20 minutes after his first one. \u201cI stand with her,\u201d Juli\u00e1n Castro, a former San Antonio mayor who later served in the Obama administration, wrote. Former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper called Trump\u2019s attack \u201cvile and shameful\u201d as well as \u201cdangerous\u201d. Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar condemned Trump and the threats against Omar while distancing herself from the congresswoman from her home state, writing: \u201cYou can disagree with her words \u2013 as I have done before \u2013 but this video is wrong. Enough.\u201d Saturday The author Marianne Williamson chimed in, connecting Trump\u2019s attack on Omar to his \u201cmenacing\u201d treatment of Hillary Clinton on the debate stage in 2016. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang talked about Islamophobia but did not directly mention Omar: The Ohio congressman Tim Ryan condemned \u201cinvoking 9/11 for political gain\u201d and wrote: \u201cWhen the president attacks a sitting member of Congress by stoking the flames of racism &amp; Islamophobia, it\u2019s dangerous because it encourages hatred and violence.\u201d He did not mention Omar by name. On Saturday afternoon, O\u2019Rourke shared a clip of a campaign-trail speech in which he discussed Trump\u2019s attack on Omar directly: California senator Kamala Harris, who is often criticized for a political record that does not match her progressive rhetoric, commented on Saturday afternoon, saying Trump was \u201cputting the safety of a sitting member of Congress at risk\u201d and \u201cvilifying a whole religion\u201d: New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand criticized Trump\u2019s \u201cdangerous rhetoric\u201d but also suggested Omar\u2019s comments were \u201cminimizing\u201d the pain of 9/11: Like O\u2019Rourke, Swalwell revisited Trump\u2019s attack with a response that mentioned Omar: The former Alaska senator Mike Gravel, a quixotic 88-year-old candidate seeking to make the debates and challenge party orthodoxy, tied attacks on Omar to his view of the bankruptcy of US foreign policy: From outside the race, the highly regarded Georgia politician Stacey Abrams, a potential contender, praised Omar\u2019s leadership and offered prayers for her safety: And finally\u2026 Omar also responded on Twitter on Saturday afternoon. \u201cI did not run for Congress to be silent,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cNo one person \u2013 no matter how corrupt, inept, or vicious \u2013 can threaten my unwavering love for America. I stand undeterred to continue fighting for equal opportunity in our pursuit of happiness for all Americans.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
