A recent Ofcom report regarding such consumption has discovered generational shifts across different news media: with young people often abandoning traditional TV news entirely in contrast to their older counterparts. Social media apps such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat have also been noted as important sites from which people get their news. Further, private groups within such apps are often a key point of news consumption for many individuals. The often ever-present smartphone has created a channel of constant access to an infinite number of news sources and we want to know which of these sources you use the most. How to contribute We are interested in hearing about all the different areas from where you find your news stories. Where do you get your news from? We would like to know where key conversations are happening, both within and away from the traditional media. Where on the internet do you find your main sources of news? Do you listen to podcasts? Do you use social media applications such as Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat? If so, are you part of any private groups in which important discussions are happening and what sort of things are being shared? Do such conversations have an impact on your overall attitudes? Do you notice changing habits in your parents or among your children in the last few years? Alternatively, perhaps you prefer to use a specific independent journalism organisation for your news? If this is the case, then which one do you use? Finally, where do your family members of varying ages access their news - are there cross-generational differences?
