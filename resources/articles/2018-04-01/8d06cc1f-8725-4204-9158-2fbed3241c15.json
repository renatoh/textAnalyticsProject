Caster Semenya has done nothing wrong, unlike many of her contemporaries both male and female she has never failed a drug test and has never even had the spectre of such allegations hanging over her head. Instead of attempting to rid the sport of drug cheats, with many current competitors having served multiple suspensions, the IAAF has instead decided to go after an athlete who has simply committed the crime of being different. Semenya has hyperandrogenism, a condition where the body produces more testosterone than would be usual. The IAAF argues that her elevated testosterone levels provide her an unfair advantage over other female athletes, however this argument when looked at in the wider picture of elite sport is ridiculous. Should we now do away with 7-foot basketball players as well? Make no mistake, the IAAF\u2019s new policy, stating that a woman must have a testosterone level of 5.0 nanomols per litre of blood will almost certainly be ruled illegal the minute it is put before any form of human rights commission; although with the IAAF based in Monaco it\u2019s hard to know what the process for that to happen is. It\u2019s fair to say though that if Athletics Australia tried to enforce such a rule to domestic competition it would be highly illegal once challenged federally. Complicating matters further would be different state laws, in the ACT it is illegal to exclude trans or intersex athletes based on such grounds, while in Victoria the current laws would likely provide enough wriggle room to be enforced. To her credit Semenya has taken it on the chin and has flagged a shift to the longer 5000m and 10,000m events to continue her career. She refuses to suppress her testosterone, and so she should. This is an attack on her and her alone from those who simply don\u2019t like that she doesn\u2019t fit into their neat box of what a woman is. The fact that these new limitations only apply to the events she has dominated for so long means that the IAAF\u2019s attack on her isn\u2019t even subtle, such is the arrogance with which the organisation operates. Despite not competing in athletics, as a trans athlete these new rules wouldn\u2019t actually affect me in the slightest if I was - this is something which largely effects intersex athletes alone. My personal testosterone levels are far below the IAAF\u2019s new requirements, as are most trans athletes. However what the IAAF has done is back itself into a corner in any future debates when it comes to transgender athletes - a topic they are yet to adequately face - while exposing the absurd hypocrisy society as a whole has demonstrated when dealing with those who are transgender. The IAAF has clearly decided that a drop in testosterone significantly effects performance, and so it only stands to reason that when a trans athlete whose testosterone is suppressed finally reaches the top level of the sport they will allow them to compete without question. Or so you would think, however I very much doubt it would be the case. For while society seems to understand the effects of what would happen if you reduced an intersex athlete like Semenya\u2019s testosterone by only a fraction, people still seem to think a trans athlete who produces no testosterone would somehow maintain their previous abilities. But paradoxes like that aside, this exposes the prejudice which still exists in what has typically been a very exclusive and elite sport in the way it is run. I can\u2019t for a second imagine the IAAF taking such action against a male runner with naturally occurring elevated testosterone. Nor can I imagine them doing it to a white runner for that matter. Even if on an unconscious level, racism and more so in this instance, sexism, is clearly very much still a factor in how certain athletes are treated. If the specific targeting of Semenya couldn\u2019t be clearer, the fact that the IAAF ignored research that showed other events were more likely to benefit from elevated testosterone than the 400, 800 and 1500m can only seal the deal. Hammer throw was one such event, however the IAAF chose to not impose any restrictions on those athletes for reasons only known to them. Semenya has known this has been coming for a while though, and I\u2019m sure her legal team would be well prepared. I remember being told a year ago now the IAAF was going to introduce this change, and it\u2019s hard to imagine this information wouldn\u2019t have reached her then either. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is the real unknown in this, and it will be over to them to show some sort of leadership where it is clearly lacking in athletics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
