The prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, said the strikes in multiple locations \u201ccompletely destroyed rockets and other heavy weapons\u201d belonging to the well-armed regional government and made it impossible for a retaliatory attack. There was no mention of casualties in what Abiy called the \u201cfirst round of operation\u201d against the region\u2019s government, the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front. He said the air force destroyed heavy weapons in Tigray\u2019s capital, Mekele, and surrounding areas. The operation in the northernmost of the nine regions of Ethiopia will continue \u201cuntil the junta is made accountable by law\u201d, Abiy said. He asserted that the \u201clarge-scale law enforcement operation\u201d has \u201cclear, limited and achievable objectives: to restore the rule of law and the constitutional order\u201d. The TPLF dominated Ethiopia\u2019s government before Abiy took office in 2018, but its power has since waned. Abiy\u2019s government launched military operations in Tigray on Wednesday, after he accused the TPLF of attacking a military camp in the region and attempting to loot military assets. The TPLF denies the attack and has accused Abiy of concocting the story to justify deploying the military. There was no immediate response from the government in Tigray to the announcement of airstrikes. The region is being increasingly boxed in by movement restrictions and a six-month state of emergency imposed by the federal government. Earlier in the day Abiy had threatened Tigray\u2019s leaders, warning that there was \u201cno place for criminal elements\u201d in Ethiopia. \u201cThe proud Ethiopian people of Tigray [and] other citizens cannot be taken hostage by fugitives from justice forever. We shall extract these criminal elements [from Tigray and] relaunch our country on a path to sustainable prosperity for all,\u201d last year\u2019s Nobel peace prize winner said in a statement on social media. \u201cWhat has been initiated against us is clearly a war, an invasion \u2026 This is a war we\u2019re conducting to preserve our existence,\u201d Debretsion Gebremichael, chair of the TPLF and president of the Tigray region, said at a press conference. Debretsion said fighting persisted in western Tigray and that federal troops were gathering on the border in the neighbouring Amhara and Afar regions. Diplomats in Addis Ababa said there have been casualties on both sides, but with internet and phone connections in Tigray cut there was no confirmation or details of the reports. The fighting in Tigray has drawn expressions of concern from the UN, US and EU. \u201cThe stability of Ethiopia is important for the entire Horn of Africa region. I call for an immediate de-escalation of tensions and a peaceful resolution to the dispute,\u201d the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, wrote on Twitter. Experts fear a protracted and disastrous conflict that could \u201cseriously strain an Ethiopian state already buffeted by multiple grave political challenges, and send shockwaves into the Horn of Africa region and beyond\u201d. \u201cA war that many Ethiopians feared was possible but hoped would never happen appears to be under way \u2026 Unless urgently halted [it] will be devastating not just for the country but for the entire Horn of Africa,\u201d the International Crisis Group said in a briefing on Thursday. Tigray\u2019s people make up 5% of Ethiopia\u2019s 109 million population, but the region is wealthier and more influential than many other, larger, regions. Under Abiy, Tigrayan leaders have complained of being unfairly targeted in corruption prosecutions, removed from top positions, and blamed for the country\u2019s problems. One factor in the latest crisis is the postponement of national elections due to the Covid-19 pandemic. National polls were due to take place in August, but electoral officials ruled in March that all voting would be delayed until the threat from the virus had eased. When parliamentarians voted to extend officials\u2019 mandates \u2013 which would have expired in early October \u2013 Tigrayan leaders went ahead with regional elections in September that Abiy\u2019s government deemed illegal. Now each side sees the other as illegitimate, and federal lawmakers have ruled that Abiy\u2019s government should cut off contact with, and funding to, Tigray\u2019s leadership. The Tigray region is home to a large portion of the federal military personnel and the location of much of its equipment, a legacy of Ethiopia\u2019s 1998-2000 border war with Eritrea, its northern neighbour. Some analysts estimate that Tigray could muster more than half of the armed forces\u2019 total personnel and mechanised divisions, meaning that neither side could be confident of a swift victory. There are widespread fears that open conflict will inspire further secessionist sentiment in other parts of Ethiopia. \u201cWe\u2019re working to ensure the war won\u2019t come to the centre of the country. It will end there in Tigray,\u201d said general Berhanu."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
