The Panorama programme, broadcast on Monday night, uncovered a raft of safety issues on the site in Cumbria which stores almost all of the country\u2019s nuclear waste. The investigation was prompted by a whistleblower, once a senior manager in Sellafield, who revealed a litany of safety concerns including degraded infrastructure, improper storage of highly radioactive materials and chronic under staffing across the site. Speaking anonymously, he told the programme he worried about the safety of the site \u201cevery day\u201d. Panorama revealed how radioactive chemicals are stored in plastic bottles on the site that should only ever have been used as short-term storage. Despite the efforts of scientists at Sellafield to try to eradicate the problem, the probe found more than 2,000 bottles with the toxic materials still on site. Dr Rex Strong, head of nuclear safety at Sellafield, said: \u201cThe organisation is now focusing on putting right some underinvestments of the past in order to support the hazard and waste reduction mission that the site has.\u201d Sellafield later said in a statement that plutonium and uranium samples were \u201ckept securely\u201d and that \u201cto imply that such material is inappropriately managed is simply not true\u201d. The whistleblower said that his biggest fear for the site was for one of the nuclear waste silos to go up in flames \u2013 the consequences of which would be dire. He said: \u201cIf there is a fire there it could generate a plume of radiological waste that will go across western Europe.\u201d It was also revealed that swaths of the plant often do not have enough staff to meet basic safety levels. Investigators for the programme found that in the space of 12 months between July 2012 and July 2013, minimum levels of safe manning levels were routinely breached. However Strong insisted that low staffing levels did not mean safety was compromised. He said: \u201cYou make alternative arrangements, so the things that have to be done, get done, and facilities are shut down if in fact we\u2019re not able to operate them in the way that we want to \u2013 it\u2019s not a level that\u2019s dangerous.\u201d One report on the site\u2019s infrastructure from 2013 featured on the programme said \u201cyears of neglect\u201d had lead to \u201cintolerable conditions\u201d in Sellafield. The programme makers linked an incident in the plant in 2013 to the crumbling infrastructure when an electricity substation exploded, leading to radioactive dust spreading into parts of the building. Sellafield\u2019s press office did not respond to repeated attempts to contact it on Monday night. However, a statement given to the programme the Nuclear Management Partners, who ran Sellafield until earlier this year, said the safety and security of the site have always been their \u201coverriding priorities\u201d and that over the past eight years the site achieved \u201cthe best overall safety \u2026 in its history.\u201d Strong added: \u201cThere\u2019s been huge and sustained investment in infrastructure at Sellafield over recent years. Safety is our priority and we are managing a very complex site which has got a great deal of hazardous radioactive materials on it.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 September 2016. An earlier version said Nuclear Management Partners ran Sellafield. The contract to own and operate Sellafield was transferred back to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority in March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
