Colonel F\u00e1bio Almeida de Souza was replaced as head of the Choque Battalion of paramilitary police after Veja magazine published inflammatory messages that he is said to have posted to fellow officers using the WhatsApp chat service. The text conversations are reportedly taken from an internal investigation into an assassination attempt on a rival officer, whose home was peppered with bullets in January 2014. Although De Souza was cleared of that wrongdoing, the messages appear to suggest he and other members of the battalion plotted to create what they called a \u201cReich\u201d inside the organisation. Referred to by his fellows as a \u201cFuhrer\u201d, De Souza described his group as \u201cpure race and flawless\u201d. In one chat, De Souza predicted he would take leadership of the paramilitary police in Rio and then said he would inflict a \u201cnuclear winter\u201d on his enemies: \u201cYou will see what revenge is.\u201d When his colleagues outlined plans for a coup, De Souza responded by writing \u201cGermany 1930 standard\u201d. During the street protests that racked Rio in June 2013, De Souza was asked about baton techniques for restraining protesters. He responded: \u201cKill them. That will immobilise them permanently.\u201d Nobody was fatally shot during the demonstrations, but De Souza boasted to his fellow officers when he hit a protester with a teargas pellet from a pump-action rifle. \u201cWhat pride!\u201d he exclaimed. The messages call into question the judgment of Rio state\u2019s top security official, Jos\u00e9 Mariano Beltrame, who promoted de Souza in November. Beltrame has denied reports that he had been previously warned about the messages. He said he was \u201chorrified\u201d by the chat between officers and is seeking a police investigation into De Souza."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
