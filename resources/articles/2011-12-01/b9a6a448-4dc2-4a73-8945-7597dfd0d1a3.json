A lady in Croydon is a racist, Jeremy Clarkson is a chump? Really? And on television, so much to catch up on \u2013 Ricky Gervais's dwarves; Sarah Lund in the rain again, pointing her torch at another murky murder that's all inextricably and inexplicably intertwined with Danish politics; Charlie Brooker's festive hog roast. The TV hard drive is clogged up with goodies. But this isn't a brilliant day to come back to. In The Big Bread Experiment (BBC2) a bunch of women in the Yorkshire town of Bedale learn to bake bread. And that's it really. Over three episodes. It's not a competition, no one's voted off. There are no charismatic master bakers, unless you count Patrick and Duncan, from Bristol, and you probably shouldn't. Or witty presenters. It's not a nationwide campaign, to get Britain on multigrain; I wouldn't even call it a Big Bread Experiment, more of a Small Bread Experiment. Honest certainly, but just a little bit dull. The women themselves \u2013 led by Cath Vickers, the vicar, who is the Vicar of Dibley \u2013 are very nice. They get a bit tipsy and fall about in fits of giggles. They make mistakes for the cameras \u2013 like melting the plastic bowl, or getting the consistency of the dough wrong \u2013 and they hoot some more. Well, at least they're enjoying it. But there isn't really enough \u2013 not even with the excitement of the Leyburn food festival or the food hygiene exam (especially terrifying for Valerie, who's never done well in exams) \u2013 for one hour of television, let alone three. Very nice isn't enough. For something like this to work as TV you need characters who are extraordinary, or hilarious, or inspirational. Or monsters. I think I know how it came about. There appears to be a craze right now for anything to do with crafts \u2013 you know, old-fashioned artisan skills that have nothing to do with computers. Baking is clearly at the heart of it. It's a backlash against technology. And if you can couple one of these crafts with the word \"community\", then you're on to a winner. \"Bringing a community together through blah\", that's even better. Honestly, if you don't believe me, give it a go \u2013 call the BBC, tell them you want to make a documentary about bringing a community together through whittling, or fletching, or mangelwurzeling, and you'll get the go-ahead, promise. A series most probably, hours of television to fill. To be fair, this one isn't just about making bread: there's also an old watermill up the road that's being restored. Which will hopefully mill the corn to make the flour for Rev Cath and Valerie etc to make the bread. And it's ringing a bell, quite a loud one: wasn't there ...? Yes, just a few months ago, Village SOS with Sarah Beeny on BBC1! Somewhere a bit like Yorkshire \u2013 that's right, Wales, where an old watermill was restored, by the village. And when it was up and running, they milled corn into flour, and then the women of the village opened a bakery and made delicious bread. And it totally brought the community together, obviously. Right, I'm now going to close the curtains, in case the neighbours look in, not that I know them. And I'm going to go on Twitter, that's my community. And when I get hungry, I'll stick a couple of slices of Mother's Pride in the toaster. Mmmm. How can Harry M \u2013 the blond one, little Boris Johnson \u2013 possibly still be in Young Apprentice (BBC1)? Oh, not now he's not. Bye. But James is. He's in the final. That's ridiculous \u2013 and a problem with the elimination system. It should be Harry H, or Lizzie, but as members of the losing team, they're out with Harry M. Anyway, I think we all know who's going to win, and she's not James. You see, there's nothing nice about any of these people, and they couldn't be less community spirited. They're evil little monsters, out to kill each other. And Lord Sugar is out to kill the English language. There are some good Sugarisms in this one, but my favourite is one of his comments to Zara (Young Apprentice winner 2011 or I'll eat my hat): \"I think I find you, and how can I put this nicely, somewhat aloof of dirtying one's hands,\" he tells her. And also, why is he so down on La Popcorn as a brand name? I like it \u2013 it's like Le Big Mac. Much better than Amstrad, anyway. Anyway, they're awful, all of them, including Lord Sugar. But it's brilliant television, a hell of a lot more entertaining than the community bread."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
