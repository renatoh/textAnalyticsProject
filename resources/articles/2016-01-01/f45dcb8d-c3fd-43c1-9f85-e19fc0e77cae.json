Ashton was found guilty of making contact with the eyes of the Ulster centre Luke Marshall and, barring a judicial reprieve, will be sidelined until 28 March. Ashton, who had been pushing hard for an England recall, has until Saturday lunchtime to lodge an appeal against the outcome of an independent disciplinary hearing in London. He was cited by the match citing commissioner, France\u2019s Yves Thieffine, after grabbing Marshall\u2019s head and dragging him to the ground in the 16th minute of Saracens\u2019 European Champions\u2019 Cup pool game at Allianz Park on Saturday. The suspension could not have come at a worse moment for Ashton with England\u2019s opening Six Nations game against Scotland at Murrayfield just over a fortnight away. Jones, had recalled him to his squad and the 28-year-old was expected to start his first international game since the summer of 2014. Asked on Wednesday if the onus was on Ashton not to put himself in that position Jones said: \u201c100%, but I am disappointed for him. He was a player in our squad; I am disappointed for him. He\u2019s got to take responsibility for it. \u201cIs the suspension too hard? No. That\u2019s the suspension he\u2019s got. So he\u2019s got to sit it out or appeal. Obviously he\u2019s going to miss the Six Nations unless he appeals and wins the appeal. It\u2019s terrible luck for Chris, but he\u2019s been punished.\u201d The Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, whose side beat Ulster 33-17, had indicated earlier this week he expected the charge to be dismissed. At the time the referee J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garc\u00e8s said he could not see anything \u201cclear and obvious\u201d after reviewing the footage but awarded a penalty for a dangerously high tackle. Ashton pleaded not guilty but was found to have committed the equivalent of a red card offence. Under World Rugby\u2019s disciplinary code, making contact with an opponent\u2019s eyes carries a lower-end entry point of 12 weeks and the winger was also given an extra week as a deterrent to others. Three weeks were then deducted for his good character and conduct at the hearing. Ashton, who has 39 caps, theoretically remains free to train with the England squad next week pending a potential appeal. Jones, however, will now have to consider picking a replacement wing, with Bath\u2019s Semesa Rokoduguni the leading contender. Jonny May and Christian Wade are already sidelined because of injury, leaving Anthony Watson and either Jack Nowell or Marland Yarde as the leading wing options to face Scotland. Jones, whose 33-man squad are due to meet in Bagshot on Sunday night to start their Six Nations preparations, is likely to hold fire, however, and await any developments over the next couple of days."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
