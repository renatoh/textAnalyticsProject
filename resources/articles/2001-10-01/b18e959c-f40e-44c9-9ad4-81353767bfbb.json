After The Homecoming and Afore Night Come we now have a revival of Peter Nichols' breakthrough play from 1967: one that took the taboo subject of a disabled child to examine a frayed marriage and societal confusion with a fervent comic brio. It was precisely Nichols' deployment of vaudevillian comedy to tackle a subject that would one expect to find approached with hushed naturalism that made the play so startling. But, watching the first half of Laurence Boswell's production, I felt much of the old shock had gone. Clive Owen's secondary modern teacher, Bri, failed to raise many laughs in his buttonholing address to the audience. And even the ritual games he played with Victoria Hamilton's Sheila, in which he poses as a hearty GP, Viennese paediatrician and trendy cleric, lacked the right fizz. Was it, I wondered, because we have grown more nervous about suffering? Or was it that the music-hall tradition Nichols evokes is now a matter of history? I needn't have worried. This is a play of such tensile strength that the second half takes off. And it is partly because Nichols broadens the canvas to deal not just with Bri and Sheila's defensively comic games with the disabled Joe Egg but with everyone's inadequacy in the face of suffering. Bri's old school friend, Freddie, offers bombastic charity announcing: \"I tend to raise my voice when I'm helping people.\" His wife, Pam, takes refuge in a platonic ideal of physical perfection. And Bri's lonely mum has nothing to offer except knitted woolies and self-pitying cliche. The play is not, in any sense, a manual about how to bring up a disabled child. What Nichols does, with an extraordinary humorous compassion, is to use Joe Egg to portray a strained marriage and to depict a society that doesn't really know what it believes in. In its own way, it's a state-of-the-nation play about a world that has little religious faith, a distrust of medicine and a total moral confusion on the subject of euthanasia. But Nichols always deals with issues in concrete, personal terms: nothing is more moving than Bri's concern for his helpless daughter even when he tries to assist her death. I actually think it's a great play. And, even if Owen's Bri could do with a bit more fearless audience-contact, Victoria Hamilton captures exactly Sheila's mixture of defiant optimism and fitful despair. John Warnaby also suggests that the blundering, do-gooding Freddie is a man of fundamental decency and there is a peach of a performance from Prunella Scales as Bri's primly genteel Bristolian mother. In the end Nichols' play triumphs over an initially tentative production.
