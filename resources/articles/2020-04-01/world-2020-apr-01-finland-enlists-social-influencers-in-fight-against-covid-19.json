As far as we know, Finland is the only country in the world to have defined social media as \u2018critical operators\u2019,\u201d \u2013 along with doctors, bus drivers and supermarket workers. The project is a joint initiative by the office of Finland\u2019s 34-year-old prime minister, Sanna Marin, a Helsinki social media consultancy, and Mediapool, a network of media companies tasked with helping ensure citizens\u2019 access to reliable information at all times. A consultancy, PING Helsinki, edits government announcements so they fit easily into a social media format and sends them to a network of 1,500 influencers on its books, who are free to use words and images as they like, according to Politico. \u201cIt\u2019s about supporting social media influencers in sharing reliable information related to the coronavirus, and helping ensure that the right information is available on all channels at the right time,\u201d the company said. \u201cBy working together, we can prevent the spread of false information.\u201d PING said the goals of the project were set in 2018, when they sounded \u201cfar-reaching, even distant\u201d: developing tools to enhance the credibility of social media influencers and securing reliable information in crisis situations. \u201cWe wondered if it was bit of an overreaction,\u201d it said. \u201cWhat crisis situation might we face?\u201d The company has also published a list of social media does and don\u2019ts during the coronavirus crisis, including recommendations such as stop and think before sharing; review content critically; distinguish fact from opinion; check facts and never share false information. Emmi Nuorgam, a writer, journalist, blogger and columnist with a large social media following, told the Finnish public broadcaster YLE that the pandemic \u201chighlights how panic can spread on social media, and how difficult it is to curb if the authorities\u2019 message does not get to where people actually are\u201d. Nuorgam said many social influencers \u201cnow reach the same number of people as, say, newspapers or commercial radio channels. Some audiences are insanely big. Many may have tens or hundreds of thousands of followers.\u201d A factual video about the coronavirus produced by a Finnish YouTuber, Roni Back, interviewing a government minister and a number of health experts, had over 100,000 views within two days of launch, she said. \u201cPeople get their information differently nowadays,\u201d she added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
