To put that into perspective, the bank has lost about \u00a37.00 of its market value since the credit crunch first reared its destructive head. During that period, stock markets across the board have been hyper-volatile, with bigger moves than ever seen before - so why has this particular story aroused so many opinions both within the Square Mile and outside it? Two rumours seem to have been the cause. The first was that hedge funds, an entirely imaginary group of people, were taking large positions short of the stock. The second was that the bank was seeking an emergency bail-out from the Bank of England. After the Financial Services Authority (FSA) rushed to confirm that the second rumour was not true (they have no authority over the first), they subsequently announced an investigation into the surrounding trading activity and then accused \"traders\" of spreading rumours in an uneasy marketplace to profit from fear. There are now rumours saying that a couple of very wealthy London-based financiers (one of whom is closely tied to one of our capital's most mediocre football clubs) were the ones who started these rumours by selling in enormous size; their losses after the regulators' statement are said to be in the hundreds of millions (shame). Was this the first instance of this happening? Um, no. Probably wasn't even the first instance of this happening on that day. So what can the FSA do about it? Not much by their current track record: in all their years of regulating the UK markets, they've managed a mere two criminal convictions. Obviously these phenomena are incredibly hard to police, but this just makes empty threats such as the one delivered by Sally Dewar, the managing director of Wholesale and Institutional Markets at the FSA, seem even more stupid. Dewar said: \"We will not tolerate market participants taking advantage of the current market conditions to commit abuse by spreading false rumours and dealing on the back of them.\" Well, actually you will. Not only will you tolerate it, but if your broker calls you with such a rumour, you will probably tell your sister's hairdresser's independent financial adviser to jump on the bandwagon on your behalf. Like anyone else with the money to play the game. My discomfort with these accusations stems from the fact that, in this particular instance, it seems that the only people to get hurt were the traders and their pockets. I remember training during September 11 and seeing some traders make and others lose huge amounts of money. I didn't see one jumping for joy - in fact it was those with losses who looked least guilt-ridden. On 7/7, when the bombs went off on the tube, the FTSE took a huge hit and then recovered nearly all the way; not a single person I met thought their gains weren't in some way at someone else's expense - but when you work in an industry whose ebbs and flows are dictated by world events, it is these moments that define economies long and short term, for better and for worse. Had these rumours been true (and to all but the inventor they would have seemed to be true from looking at the state of the market), would anyone be pointing fingers? If the rumours were about a takeover rather than a collapse - giving relief during a time of despair - would the FSA still have considered this unethical and kicked up such a fuss? Remember, traders are people too - and they're just as susceptible to panic as the man on the street queuing outside Northern Rock to withdraw his savings from the stricken bank. And given that no one will, ultimately, pay the price for spreading the rumours, the FSA's reputation for toothlessness will only be further exacerbated when their bark proves to be far worse than their bite."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
