This is the least likely outcome. Employers can already say no and there's not much the employee can do about it. But most don't, and the \"right to request\" enjoyed by parents of young and disabled children and, since April 2007, carers of adults has been a great success. Evaluating the policy, Hutton's own department found that: \"... the vast majority (92%) of employers reported that they would consider a request to change a working pattern from any employee ... Amongst those employers where a request had been made in the previous 12 months, just 9% said they had turned down any requests.\" Many employers have gone way beyond the minimum legal provision and have adopted flexible working policies that apply to all employees. This is self-interest. They are focused on the business benefits of flexible working patterns. They include small and medium-sized employers. As the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development has shown, vast resources and large HR departments are not necessary to introduce and manage modern working practices. It found many small businesses were providing flexibility to their employees, at little or no cost, and were seeing substantial returns in terms of happier staff and customers. The CIPD, like the TUC, would like everyone to have the right to request flexible working. In 21st century Britain, over two-thirds of women with dependent children work and most new fathers no longer see themselves solely as the main breadwinner but want to participate more in parenting and family life. As the population ages, more of us will have to balance work with caring for older parents or relatives. Businesses that don't recognise these pressures will find it increasingly difficult to recruit and retain staff. But it's not just a matter of accommodating parents and carers. Even if we don't have family commitments, we can offer our employers more commitment, energy and loyalty if we're not working over-long hours and not wasting time in long commutes; and businesses providing services beyond Monday-Friday 9am-5pm need flexible employees. Hutton shouldn't be swayed by the more excitable among the business lobby. Their members are ahead of them and they can't turn back the clock."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
