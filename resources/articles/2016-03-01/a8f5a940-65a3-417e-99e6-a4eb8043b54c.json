Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs announced the new appointees after a meeting of the organisation\u2019s board. The Academy fulfilled its promise to add new board members from diverse backgrounds, appointing Oscars producer Reginald Hudlin, Selena director Gregory Nava and Kung Fu Panda stalwart Jennifer Yuh Nelson. The board also ratified other changes in response to the #OscarsSoWhite crisis aimed at increasing diversity, including limiting voting rights to those active in the movie business. Boone Isaacs has been under intense pressure since the row over racially homogeneous acting nominees at the past two ceremonies. On Tuesday she was forced to issue another apology after two dozen Academy members published an open letter to organisers complaining about \u201ctasteless and offensive skits\u201d based on racial stereotyping at this year\u2019s ceremony. They referred to skits in last month\u2019s broadcast, during which host Chris Rock introduced three children of east Asian descent named \u201cMing Zhu, Bao Ling and David Moskowitz\u201d, who he said were \u201cthe accountants\u201d who had tabulated the Oscars results."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
