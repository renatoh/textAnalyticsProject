The shutdowns have exposed apparent fragility in the nuclear facility\u2019s workings: in December 2015 the plant was shut down for three days after droppings from a \u201clarge bird\u201d caused an arc between power lines and a transmission tower. In April 2016, Entergy admitted it had found that bolts holding together the interior of one of Indian Point\u2019s reactors were damaged and, in some cases, missing. Entergy also came under fire in 2016 after the Guardian published a safety assessment of proposed natural gas pipelines to be built by energy pipeline company Spectra on Indian Point property. The assessment, provided to the Guardian by engineer Paul Blanch and obtained through a freedom of information act (Foia), was partly hand-drawn and did not adequately account for the damage to the plant that could result from a breach of the lines. Local environmental groups have made the plant a nemesis, though those who work at the facility in Buchanan, New York, want it to remain open. The plant employs just under 1,000 people; Entergy\u2019s chairman and CEO, Leo Denault, thanked Indian Point\u2019s employees in a statement on the coming closure and said the company was \u201ccommitted to treating our employees fairly and will help those interested in other opportunities to relocate within the Entergy system\u201d. Paul Gallay, of activist group Riverkeeper, has campaigned long and hard to have the plant closed. \u201cGiven the scope of the risk Indian Point poses, this is an essential step to a safer and more secure New York,\u201d Gallay told the Guardian. Gallay said that although the announcement was encouraging, the project of detoxification was just beginning. \u201cThe very first priority is to get the spent fuel out of the overpacked storage pools where it\u2019s resided for the whole 45-year length of the operation of the facility,\u201d he said. \u201cThis agreement requires that and must be followed by prompt and full radiological decommissioning.\u201d But he was pleased, he said. With Indian Point closed, \u201cnecessary cleanup work can begin in earnest\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
