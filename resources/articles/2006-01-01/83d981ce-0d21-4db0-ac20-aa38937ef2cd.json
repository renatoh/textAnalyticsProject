For six months I could only function on autopilot. Luckily, my husband's support meant I did not have to worry about work or paying the bills. Few other women are so fortunate. Most face utter isolation, discrimination and exploitation - a situation that will not change until there is a huge shift in public attitudes. Last month legislation finally made discrimination in the workplace against people with HIV illegal. But there has been no stampede to take legal action by women, and nor is that likely. While some brave men have lodged claims against their employers, women are far less likely to do so, for the simple reason that they have even more to lose. I know many women who have left their jobs, or been thrown out of them, thanks to HIV. One friend, Jane, was a geography teacher, a job she loved. After confiding in a colleague why she had to make monthly journeys to her London consultant, she was given marching orders by the head, \"for the sake of the parents, who wouldn't understand\". Then there are women like Tilly, who had to abandon her job six months ago because she felt ill and had lost weight. Her doctors thought she had leukaemia. But learning of her ex-husband's violent behaviour, one enlightened doctor suggested that she have an HIV test. Tilly still dare not tell her children her true diagnosis, in case they won't let her cuddle her grandchildren. She doesn't know how she is going to cope with retirement, since she never worried about a pension when she was a \"respectable\" married woman. Many women face a double penalty. Women are already at the harsher end of the labour market: in part-time, less well-paid jobs, fitting in what they can during school hours to make ends meet. These jobs can be precarious enough without the perceived stigma of HIV. Even the many who return to work experience discrimination. Emily, after a bout of ill-health, wanted to work part-time in a corner shop and explained why she might need time off. \"No problem,\" replied the owner. But when Emily called back, the owner had discussed it with her husband. Suddenly, it seemed, their daughter was available to help. Thirteen years ago, when I was first diagnosed, fewer than 20% of those diagnosed in the UK were women. Now 43% of all newly diagnosed people are women, and there are 18,000 HIV-positive women in this country. In light of the experiences of Emily, Tilly and Jane - and many others - small wonder that only a handful of us dare to go public. How many women diagnosed with HIV are going to feel strong enough to tell their employers? Or take a stand if they find the jokes about Aids too much to bear? What if their children are bullied? What if their employers persist in thinking incorrectly that their condition puts staff or customers at risk? Changing laws and policies is certainly important, but only the very first step towards changing public opinion. What the government needs to do now - indeed what the likes of the Confederation of British Industry need to do - is to learn from major companies such as Standard Chartered Bank and Heineken: that good workplace policies also make good business sense. Lack of public awareness is still the major obstacle. Most women with HIV never thought they were at risk. We hope the government, employers and the media will one day listen to women like Tilly, Emily and Jane, and develop realistic policies and practices to support them and to help the rest of society learn from us what HIV is really about.
