If you've watched episiode two on Channel 4 join us here \u2026 Steve Busfield's review of episode one Confusion reigns in Iraq. Why is the first marine division enduring fire on the edge of Nasiriya when it should be storming through the town? Why is Spanish being spoken on the comms? Or is it Portuguese? Who's the real sicko \u2013 the jarhead or the reporter? Most importantly of all, though: moustaches, in or out? Episode two, and there is now no doubt that this is brought to you by the makers of The Wire. There's the barrage of characters, none of whom are given any scenes in which to introduce themselves and their personal neuroses (the intricate explanatory graphics on the HBO site leave you hardly any the wiser), and there's the snap and crackle of the dialogue. Both are hallmarks of a Simon and Burns production. Oh, and did I mention the institution? For the cause of the marines' beaching on the banks of the Euphrates is not the resistance they face on the other side of the river, but the bad decision-making of their command. A brief scene introducing General Mattis \u2013 the only thing that scares the Godfather \u2013 rectifies that problem, but another one comes around the corner shortly afterwards as Bravo company are sent down a dead end only to have the blame swiftly apportioned to them. It's the management that's at fault, not the men, and that's something any fan of The Wire will have seen many a time before. The focus of attention remains Alpha team and, in particular, Sgt Brad Colbert and his driver, Cpl Josh Person. Person is Ziggy, not just the same actor (James Ransone) but the same gobby individual who, by rights, ought to annoy the hell out of everyone but in fact provokes real affection and loyalty. Like the fool in a Shakespeare play (not the parallel Simon himself likes to draw, but still) Person can, however, offer wisdom in the midst of a barrage of bull. His exchange with Evan Wright, the Rolling Stone reporter, is a case in point. Wright spots a child bleeding in the road, her legs blown off by ordnance. He pulls out his suitably old-school film camera to shoot a harrowing image, only to be immediately hit by a lecture. \"Who's the sicko now?\" screams Person. \"The psycho-assed jarheads? Or the liberal media looking for some exploitation?\" While Wright continues to sit next to Lt Cpl Harold Trombley, I'd have to say my psycho-meter would be pointing at the jarheads. Trombley, a marine who manages to combine both wide-eyed innocence and a ravenous need to kill is the scariest character in the piece so far. He gets his wishes granted this episode, shooting a sniper dead as Bravo company are pushed through the small town of al-Gharraf on the orders of the Godfather. It's a tense skirmish (though, to my mind, not as tense as the scene where team two race to beat a pair of RPG-armed Imperial Guard to the punch), but the marines come through unharmed. Their morale is boosted, their sense of purpose restored. It's an odd topsy-turvy sensation, watching soldiers enjoying their job. Confusion reigns for the viewer, too. Sitrep notes (thanks to the Godfather I now know the meaning of the term my colleague Richard Vine has been using in his excellent Battlestar Galactica blogs): Number of spits through teeth (the correct way): 6 Number of spits with lips (incorrect): 1 Current status of moustache regulations: banned, as anyone with a moustache could be an iraqi infiltrator. Quotable: \"Fucking officers will be the death of us\" - Person after being ordered to find a higher-up gone missing after a toilet break.
