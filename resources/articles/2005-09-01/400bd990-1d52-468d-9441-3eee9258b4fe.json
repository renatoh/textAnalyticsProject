Simon Brophy took advantage of the \"chaos\" leading up to the dome's millennium celebrations in 1999 to secretly set up a company to which he awarded a lucrative contract for lighting up the Greenwich landmark before funnelling his profits - estimated at \u00a31m- through a \"complex\" web of overseas bank accounts. Southwark crown court heard that Brophy's spending included a plush Docklands apartment, property in Florida, and a fleet of luxury cars. Brophy, 39, yesterday pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defrauding the New Millennium Experience Company, four counts of corruption, four of furnishing false information and one of removing the proceeds of crime from the UK. Also in the dock was David Gordon, the Australian-born director of Brophy's secret front company, Pro-Design Ltd. Gordon, 44, of Seaview, Isle of Wight, admitted conspiracy to defraud and fraudulent trading. He was jailed for nine months. Passing sentence on Brophy, Judge Christopher Hardy said that he must have considered himself \"extremely fortunate\" when in 1988 he was appointed head of what was then one of the biggest lighting projects in Europe. \"Your conduct in business affairs is reprehensible in the highest degree,\" the judge said. He also banned Brophy from holding a company directorship for five years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
