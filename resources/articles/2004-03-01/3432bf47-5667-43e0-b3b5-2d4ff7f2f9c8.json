Yet the true cost of cruise ship holidays is coming under increasing scrutiny amid accusations these 'floating cities' are destroying the oceans they were designed to explore. Conservationists liken them to mobile sewage farms, spewing millions of gallons of untreated and chemical-saturated waste into the sea as they journey to some of the planet's most remote places. A single cruise liner can pump more than 130,000 litres of sewage a day into the ocean. Only now, after years of mounting protest, will new regulations be announced this week to ban the practice. Hundreds of cruise ships including the flagships of P&amp;O and Cunard, which sail from Southampton, will be told to stop spewing waste into the sea or install sophisticated sewage treatment plants. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO), a UN body that sets shipping standards, believes the waste from the vessels, which can house up to 5,000 passengers and crew, poses an unacceptable threat. An IMO spokesman described the new laws as 'very important' in tackling marine pollution. Pumping sewage, oily water and chemicals into the oceans has been linked to the destruction of coral reefs and to dead zones: oxygen-free areas where marine life cannot survive. Cruising is the fastest-growing sector of the British holiday market. More than 960,000 Britons took an ocean cruise in 2003 - up by 135,000 passengers on the previous year. Analysts expect the introduction of Cunard's Queen Mary 2 - the longest, heaviest and tallest passenger ship ever - to cement the sector's popularity. Overall, more than 250 cruise liners carried 10 million people to some of the world's most pristine ecosystems. Sam Haswell of Oceana, a coalition of 30 environmental groups that has been demanding advanced waste treatment technology, said: 'The cruise industry's growth rate is the envy of the travel industry. That's great for profits, but not so great for the seas on which those profits are made.' Britain will join more than 140 other countries this week in adopting the IMO regulations, to be introduced immediately on all new ships and in five years on all others. By 2005, about 50 more cruise ships will have been added to the global fleet, all seeking out new and more exciting destinations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
