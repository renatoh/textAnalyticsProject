He was hardly coach apparent", "bodyText": "When Stuart Pearce returns to his office following Sunday's abrupt end to England's participation in the European Under-21 championship there will be a contract awaiting his endorsement. It offers him two more years in charge of a squad that he took to the last four in 2007 after only a handful of months in charge, to the final in 2009 and to the last eight this year. Not a bad record, perhaps. But should he be encouraged to sign it? Pearce's easily caricatured patriotism and innate determination, so well remembered from a playing career that included 78 senior international caps, will no doubt lead him to swallow the disappointment of the team's collapse against the Czech Republic and accept an offer designed to take him through to the end of the next championship. That disappointment, indeed, might well provide the fuel for a renewal of his desire to do better. Others will look at the performance of the team under his command and wonder if it is time for a change. Two years ago a team including James Milner, Adam Johnson and Theo Walcott proceeded confidently to the final, only to find themselves outclassed and on the end of a 4-0 thrashing by the Germany of Mesut Ozil, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng, Sami Khedira and Manuel Neuer, who were immediately promoted to the seniors and could be found administering similar treatment to Fabio Capello's outfit in Bloemfontein 12 months later. Lessons, it was said, would be learnt. So what have we seen in Denmark over the past fortnight? A team not lacking in spirit but devoid of the means with which to turn energy and desire into victory, symbolised by their extreme difficulty in manufacturing goal chances and in capitalising on the few opportunities they did engineer. A team that, after opening with two highly unimpressive draws, threatened to pull off a narrow win in the final group match after taking the lead with a quarter of an hour to go but then catastrophically crumbled in the closing stages, conceding a terrible goal in the 89th minute and another in stoppage time. England's footballers have been no strangers to traumatic reverse in recent years, from Ronaldinho's big dipper of a free-kick in Shizuoka to the heart-stopping mishaps suffered by Paul Robinson and Scott Carson on separate occasions, a year apart, against Croatia. As collapses go, however, the one that occurred in Viborg on Sunday night was surely the most dramatic since the afternoon at Euro 2004 when the senior team went into injury time in their opening group match leading France 1-0 through a goal scored in the 38th minute by Frank Lampard, only to concede two goals, both to Zinedine Zidane, in the 91st and 93rd minutes. That defeat, in Lisbon's Estadio da Luz, did not remove Sven-Goran Eriksson's team from the tournament but it did undermine their confidence, particularly in the defensive resilience for which English teams are supposed to be renowned. Given the nature of the famous 6-3 defeat by Hungary at Wembley in 1953, the late collapse against Germany in Leon in 1970 and the defeat by Holland that cost a place in the 1994 World Cup finals, this belief might be seen as a classic example of persistent self-delusion. But one might expect a team coached by a former defender of such high repute as Pearce not to fall apart like a meringue in a light shower. Forget the absence of Jack Wilshere and Andy Carroll. Pearce failed to make the most of the resources at his disposal. He went into the first match with a captain, Michael Mancienne, whom he substituted in each of the first two matches and left on the bench for the crucial fixture against the Czechs. From a full-time manager in charge of a two-year campaign this seemed like exceptionally poor planning. If Pearce represents the FA's best attempt to prepare a young English manager for the eventual succession to the top job \u2013 and he does \u2013 then St George's Park, the national football centre at Burton-on-Trent due to be commissioned late next year, cannot start its mission of coaching the coaches soon enough. Ecclestone empire does not need BBC's gilding In light of the reports that Bernie Ecclestone funded the recent purchase of a pair of palatial homes in London and Los Angeles for his younger daughter at an aggregate cost of around \u00a3150m, I am personally very relaxed about the idea of the BBC terminating its relationship with grand prix racing, possibly before its current arrangement expires in 2013. There is something repellent about the idea of licence-payers' money contributing, however indirectly, to such indulgence. Although the BBC does a fine job with Formula One, it is hard to escape the conviction that it over-eggs the pudding. When your deal involves an investment of \u00a3300m over five years, you probably feel the need to push the boat out. But does it really take Jake Humphreys, David Coulthard, Eddie Jordan, Martin Brundle, Ted Kravitz and Lee McKenzie \u2013 admirable as they (mostly) are \u2013 to do the job that Murray Walker and James Hunt once accomplished to everybody's satisfaction? It rains, and cricket drowns It is 10 minutes past four o'clock on the third day of a Test match. Thanks to wet weather, 15,000 spectators have seen 28 balls bowled in the previous three hours. Now the sun is out and the covers are off. But the umpires decide that, before play can resume, the players must take tea, in order to prevent the third session lasting more than the statutory maximum of three hours. There are jeers from people who have paid between \u00a340 and \u00a370 for their tickets. It is a wonder the dissent is so restrained. To describe cricket's eternal lack of self-awareness as asinine would be to insult a noble four-legged breed. Missing the Praying Mantis If Fausto Coppi's long limbs and arched back earned him the nickname of the Heron, Juan Mauricio Soler could be called the Praying Mantis. At 6ft 3in the 2007 winner of the Tour de France's king of the mountains jersey stands out among the specialist climbers in the professional peloton. Now the Colombian is recovering from head injuries suffered during a crash in the Tour of Switzerland. He will be missed at next month's Grand D\u00e9part."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
