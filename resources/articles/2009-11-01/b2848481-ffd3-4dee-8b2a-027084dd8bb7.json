The ban on carrying liquids, aerosols and gels above 100ml in hand luggage will remain in place until 29 April 2013 if a revised timetable drawn up last week by security officials from member states is rubber-stamped by the European parliament. The draft regulation, seen by the Guardian, raises the possibility of a two-tier airport security system by allowing individual airports to lift volume restrictions on liquids as soon as they buy the correct screening machinery. Under such a scenario, passengers could shuttle between airports where liquids are unrestricted and smaller destinations where they will be forced to dump or check in drinks, toiletries and perfume above a certain size. \"This way, airports would be able to facilitate the carriage of liquids by departing passengers by deploying, for example, screening equipment for liquid explosives at one security check lane. Furthermore, some airports may choose to install advanced equipment more quickly,\" the document says. Transfer passengers from non-EU countries will be allowed to carry liquids on to connecting flights from 2011, ending a restriction that has seen the impounding of duty-free goods. However, duty-free purchases must be packed in a sealed bag with a receipt showing where and when the goods were bought. The commission says all airports should be able to screen suspect liquids in just over three years. It has altered plans to relax the rules in 2012 for airports handling more than 10 million passengers a year. Smaller airports would have waited until 2014 but the proposal was deemed impractical and potentially confusing for passengers. Air passengers must carry liquids and gels in containers no larger than 100ml under current restrictions, which were imposed in 2006 after the break-up of a plot to blow up transatlantic airliners travelling from Heathrow to North America. The restrictions forced UK airports to spend at least \u00a3100m on extra security lanes and guards, while passengers endured long queues at security gates as well as loss of possessions. At Heathrow airport alone, 2,000 tonnes of liquids are confiscated every year. The leading manufacturers of screening machines, Smiths Group and Rapiscan, say the ban can be lifted earlier because their scanners require only a software upgrade to detect suspect liquids. Security officials remain sceptical, and fear that a rapid lifting of the ban will not give airports enough time to invest in state-of-the-art screening equipment. Airport owners are waiting for regulators to approve the software changes before adapting their machines. BAA, the UK's largest airport owner, uses aTix (Advanced Threat Identification X-ray) scanners made by Smiths, which require such a software upgrade to detect dangerous liquids and gels. A commission spokesman said the proposals, drawn up at a meeting last week of the commission's air security committee, comprised of security officials from member states including the UK, were still in draft form. The final proposal will be sent to the European parliament, which will have three months to approve or reject it. Brussels sources say MEPs are likely to rubber-stamp the proposals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
