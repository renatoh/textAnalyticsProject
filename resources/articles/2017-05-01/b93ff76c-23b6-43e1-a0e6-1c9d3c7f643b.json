That\u2019s about us, then - thanks all for your company and comments. Nighty-night! So there we are: three in four years for Selby, number 1 for 116 weeks straight, and he\u2019s already a great of the game. He\u2019s also only 33, so there\u2019s plenty more to come - all the more incredible given how many ridiculous other players are out there. Higgins, who Selby took pains to point out is a splendid bloke, takes his cheque. I missed the amount, but Selby takes home \u00a3375,000; not bad. Selby joins Davis, Hendry and O\u2019Sullivan as the only men to have retained the world championship. \u201cUnbelievable, I can\u2019t believe it,\u201d says Selby. \u201cI\u2019m still pinching myself.\u201d\u201d Er, it only happened five minutes ago. He says that he was knackered yesterday, \u201cnothing left to give,\u201d but decided that if he was going out he was going out fighting, Higgins missed a couple of balls he\u2019d not normally missed, and there we go. That\u2019s three in four years, and me oh my, he\u2019s going win a fair few more of these; he is streets ahead of the rest. His potting, his safety, his invention, his cue-power, his frankly obscene will, his unnerving calmness; he is the man. And John Higgins is the other man, because what a final he\u2019s given us. AND THERE IT IS! Selby pauses, flexes both forearms as his people, and then keeps going. 44 ahead, 55 remaining ... one more red ... This isn\u2019t an easy table, but you just know Selbz will navigate his way around it. He\u2019s up to 21 now, has the black in play, and finds himself jabbing it home; there\u2019s a red for him, but not the one he intended. Four reds and blacks needed, so not the two difficult ones on the top cushion. Selby plays it beautifully, pots the blue in the yellow pocket, and if he can see away the next red and get position - he can - this might well be frame and championship. It was fun while it lasted. Selby leaves a red, Higgins cuts it too thinly, cannons the blue, and it goes to the corner. The question is what comes next, becauzse the pink is in the road and it\u2019s a problem to catch it full-ball, so Selby is around the table measuring. Gah! Higgins runs out of position on 19, so Selby\u2019s back up on the bottom cushion and the safety beginsagain. Higgins plays a lovely safety shot, leaving the white on the side cushion with the brown close by. Selby then plays down to the top cushion ... and he\u2019s left a devilishly tricky one to the middle! Dare Higgins try for it? ... This is the match ... You bet! It\u2019s there! Here we go then. There\u2019s a red on the top cushion, or just off it, and the white is nearby, but an angle ... dare Selby roll it down the rail? He settles down to try, then changes his mind. Selby leaves a double ... Higgins thinks hard before taking it on, takes it on, misses ... but leaves nothing. \u2018Iggins could play a pot, but knowing any miss could be his last, he leaves the white on the top cushion, prompting Selby to have a think. He reminds me a bit of a mate who played chess for Scotland, and not Sinai School as I did. So we\u2019d play at university, I\u2019d do my four knights opening or some variation thereof, compete for bit, then at some point he\u2019d have a think for ten minutes, and it\u2019d be all over shortly thereafter. Higgins clips the green with his cue, sticks the white into the reds, and it\u2019s just a foul, not a miss. Higgins is perplexed; \u201cYou\u2019ve had a result there,\u201d says Selby. Higgins catches a red too thin, but it works out nicely - the chwhite is in the jaws of the yellow pocket. BUT SELBY FEATHERS A CUT INTO THE MIDDLE, TAKING A RED FROM OUTSIDE THE BLUE, PAST IT, AND IN! IT WASN\u2019T EVEN ON, BUT IT WAS! Higgins is now tight in behind the green. So, frame 33 begins as we pass the 11-hour mark. 131! What skill! What moxie! This is such a break. The state of the game, after three lost frames in a row, to go to within one of victory, after a rerack, that started with a pressure red. AND THERE\u2019S THE TON! Selby is gently working his way through the the balls, now up to 36. There are lots of pottable reds and pink and black both in play, as they should be; the opening pot, under that level of pressure, was astoundingly brilliant. In it goes! Great pot! The white flies up the table, so it\u2019ll be the yellow, a screw, and clack, it rams the back of the pocket and Selby\u2019s back down the business end. Oh, chuckle! Higgins has to stretch for one, fails, gets the extension and bemoans \u201ctoo much haggis\u201d. And his shot is not a good one, leaving a tempter; the problem for Selby is that if he misses, he\u2019s in trouble, but if he doesn\u2019t take it on, then what else can he do? There is nothing, nothing like this. Higgins leaves a red, a bastard of a red that demands a flat hand because the brown is proximate to the white. Selby cues beautifully to stick it home, but is quickly cursing to the heavens when he fails to get on the pink by the finest of margins. We\u2019re back to in and out of the cluster. Another rerack looks possible for second, but Selby plays up the table. He has not. Selby plays away from the touching ball but up to baulk. Selby doesn\u2019t like his break, leaving a red as a shot to nothing, but Higgins misses it and is quickly tapping the table while tight on the bottom cushion. Two cushions and into the pack, by the look of things ... he plays it well, but has he left a thin cut? That black, then. They\u2019re playing in and out of the cluster now - this is horrific! And after Higgins feathers an impossibly delicate one, they quickly agree to a rerack! I\u2019ve no idea how they can possibly be holding it down. Tremendous long pot from Selby, but he doesn\u2019t hit it hard enough to get nicely on the black. So he plays a lovely, gentle cut - down it goes - only now he\u2019s not on a red, so back goes the white towards the top cushion. Wild squeals in the arena as Higgins nails a lovely long pot, holding for the black. He plays a bad positional shot, though, and can\u2019t redeem it with a red to the green pocket. But he gets lucky with the run, leaving nothing on, so Selbzo initiates a safety exchange. Both John and Steve think it didn\u2019t hit, and in any case, Jan was closest, thought it didn\u2019t, so said what he saw. Oh my days what a frame that was! \u201cI didn\u2019t see that hit, Mark\u201d! Somehow, Higgins now has three on the trot, and needs one more to make it a best of three! Truly, there is nothing, nothing like this! And that\u2019s there! Just the blue required... I\u2019m shaking! Eeesh. He finishes to close to the brown, but it\u2019s still pottable ... and it\u2019s there! Selby can only leave the red over the middle, almost fluking the snooker with the blue. Green to brown is the key shot, and it\u2019s coming up ... oh man.... Higgins doesn\u2019t have a pot on, but does stick the white close to the bottom cushion, leaving yellow and brown between it and the red, which is close to the top-right. And what\u2019s this! Higgins plays a bad shot from blue to red, misses the black from the side cushion, and the chase for the final red begins. Selby plays a nice little snooker for starters, easy to escape but setting him to lay a better one. He taps the red, sends the white up the table, and has the black defending the pocket it goes into. It\u2019s not a great shot, but Higgins doesn\u2019t respond with a great one, and leaves a chance into the bottom-left ... which he misses! Selby finds a plant - if it goes down and he\u2019s on a colour, that\u2019ll be the frame. He does and he doesn\u2019t, draining the plant but leaving himself without a pot. So he tucks in behind the black, EXCEPT HE DOESN\u2019T HIT THE WHITE HARD ENOUGH! Jan Verhaas calls foul, Selby says he got there, and a discussion ensues. Higgins asks for a replay but that\u2019s not allowed, and then almost talks himself out of the points as the discussion continues - what other sport gives you that kind of debate over the rules? But just when his magnanimity looks set to cost him, Higgins pulls it out of the fire, Jan stays with his original call - I think it was the right one, but even now I can\u2019t be sure, having originally thought Selby hit it. So he plays away, Higgins pots a red, and now looks like compiling a frame-clincher! This is fantastically tense! But potting the blue, Selby takes such great care to miss the brahn that he cannons the yeller; end of break, 46 the lead. Five reds and five black, incidentally. And i do mean incidentally, because the spread of the balls is not conducive to a maximum, all the more so when there\u2019s 300k on the line, not 5k. Mistake from Selby forces him to try a long red to the green pocket, down it goes snd then he\u2019s into the bunch off the black ... the Jaws music is playing. And off again. A confident Higgins plays a long red gently in order to hold for the black, misses, and Selby is at the table. Apparently the opening red is his first ball potted in half an hour. Higgins is working these shots out beautifully now, and he brings up his century to wild applause. He finishes with a 111, and finally, you feel like if he gets a chance he\u2019ll take it; but more than that, that he might be able to muscle his way through the safety exchanges. But he plays for the blue, because who needs five gee? Then a cannon on the pink has him cutting into the top corner as a shot to nothing - he ought to be on a baulk colour if it goes down. But he pots the red and holds for the blue! For the first time in a while, Selby will be wondering... If Higgins can win this one and the next one, then we\u2019re talking. And he\u2019s working this one out well, employing the spider to set up his fourth black. Just saying. Chill those beans, Harris. And there\u2019s the mistake! Selby sends a red down the rail and gets \u201cthe old DD\u201d - oo-er - \u201cthe dreaded double-kiss\u201d. Higgins strokes it home, then a black, and begins picking away at the stragglers. Another foul and a miss from Selby, but it costs him just the four points - unless Higgins can find his way in behind the green ... he plays it well. This might be the first exchange that he\u2019s controlled since yesterday, so Selby retorts by leaving him just in front of the green. Again, though, TWOW plays it well, a flick off that green leaving the chwhite on the side cushion. \u201cWhenever I watch pub sports,\u201d emails Simon McMahon, \u201cI\u2019m reminded of the late, great Sid Waddell\u2019s immortal line about the best darts player ever to come out of Kirkcaldy, the incomparable John Thomas Wilson. \u2018What an athlete\u2019. Selby just looks too strong for Higgins. I\u2019ll see thee.\u201d I don\u2019t know what pubs you\u2019ve been in - I\u2019m yet to see a snooker table in one, though I have seen some other strange sights; send in your examples to the address above. Apparently, Trueman said to Waddell \u201cbut I don\u2019t speak like that\u201d; \u201cyou do now,\u201d came back the response. Higgins takes on a pot as a shot to nothing, while Dennis offers us the old \u201cas long as your opponent needs two frames\u201d line. Selby then tries a thin one, misses, and does well to avoid ceding a free ball, the white encroaching just enough onto the baulk line. His next effort is a lot better. Serious show of gonads from Higgins here - he\u2019s crafted this 88 beautifully, and now he\u2019s playing exhibition shots, down behind the black and out again from yellow to green. Can he go on? It\u2019s a long, long time since he won two in a row. Anyway, Higgins is up to 46, sinks the pink, and rolls along beautifully for the red on the side cushion , Down it does, then the black, and if he can drain the last red, kissing the yellow on its spot, any colour and the frame\u2019s safe. And he\u2019s on the black! What Selby does so well is stay calm when in the balls. If he needs to think over shot, he thinks it over - he\u2019s deliberate, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s risk-averse. Just that when he tries the outlandish stuff, it\u2019s been properly considered and is played with a cool head. But what a lovely pot from the old master! He eases a red into the middle, deposits the green, cracks the pack, and this is now the chance he was waiting for. Very quickly, the break is 34, but that\u2019s all it is. it really does not matter. The white is left on the bottom cushion, but it isn\u2019t that - there just doesn\u2019t see any way that the momentum can be reversed. Of course he is. Higgins gets a double-kiss, and Selby is in. \u201cWatching this is a little like watching matches between Murray and Djokovic until about the middle of last year,\u201d says David Wall. \u201cThey\u2019d typically start off very tight, Murray often going ahead, before Djokovic repeatedly, and ruthlessly pulled away and ground the Scot into the dust. It\u2019s the BBC schedulers I feel most sorry for, you can almost hear them digging out an entire series of Coast to fill the rest of the evening when this finishes in two or three frames time.\u201d That\u2019s the beauty of the format. Class will out. He starts with a decent break-off... Back they come. Has Higgins got anything left? For those catching up, here\u2019s Barry Glendenning\u2019s report of the afternoon session. A 70 clearance, a spring through the curtain, a trudge from Higgins, and that\u2019s the mid-session. Selby is zoned. Selby is grinning to himself as he proceeds around the table. He knows, Higgins knows, and the whole world knows. Selby is just the complete player and a consummate competitor. In they go, then a pink, and that\u2019s that. Trying to catch a red thin, Higgins misses, and because the white\u2019s travelling, it bounces off the bottom cushion and catches the blue - that\u2019s done him a small favour, as there\u2019s now nothing on for Selby. So Higgins plays the pot, misses it and leaves it; red, blue, red and only two more required for the champion. Higgins must have the better of this safety exchange, and plays an excellent shot to cover a loose, cuttable red with the blue. So Selby responds well, obviously - his geometry is something else. \u201cNoting O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s tweet that you posted earlier on,\u201d emails David Wall, \u201cwho do you think of the current top players is most likely to go into the commentary box when they box-up their cue, and who would you most like to see make that move? I\u2019ve got a feeling that Stuart Bingham would make for an engaging commentator, and given how tortuously he studied every shot, Ebdon might make an informative pundit.\u201d Ebdon has been in the box this tournament; not to my taste, shall we say. I\u2019d go Graeme Dott. Selby is 55 ahead, with 75 on the table. A mistake on the black when he might\u2019ve played the pink leaves Selby shaking his head as he\u2019s down on the next red. But he slides it parallel with the top cushion and into the hole, but eventually chasing the white catches up with him and he misses the next red thick! Selby is so serene. The run is now 33, but there follows a mistake - he\u2019s straight on the blue, so has to play the trickier pink, which can leave him on just one red. So that\u2019s what happens, and now the black is in play! I was just about to note that Selby has done an amazing job of turning what look, at first, like mid-level breaks, into frame-winners. But then Hendry says it for me, so I\u2019m now copying him. Selby has eyes only for one red, rammed home after some thought. But the cue-ball rolls past the potting angle for the black ... so in goes the pink to the middle! This frame - this final - are not long for this world. It never rains, but sometimes it pours so hard it makes your head bleed. Selby flukes a five-ball plant, in-off the black, though he\u2019s not on a colour. So he sticks the white tight on the bottom cushion, and Higgins has a problem. \u201cIf the safety is as difficult as the pot, I know which I\u2019d be taking,\u201d advises Hendry; Higgins thinks otherwise, goes in-off, and, well. But Higgins responds well, so Selby responds weller, leaving the cue-ball tight on the bottom cushion. Playing for a thin contact on a red, Selby misses, but when he\u2019s offered another chance, a graze of the middle knuckle sends Higgins behind the green. Selby raises his hand, which I\u2019m sure is profoundly comforting. That cut... One more frame before the mid-session; surely Higgins can\u2019t afford to lose this one; and no, he couldn\u2019t afford to lose the last one either. Anyhow, a good break leaves him struggling, but he responds well, almost potting the black but instead forcing Selby to play off the side cushion into the pack ... but has he left the bottom one? Apparently not. Selby misses on 71 but it matters not. I\u2019ve no idea what Higgins can do - if Selby is potting pots that he can\u2019t even see, well. Three reds and three high-value colours needed - it\u2019s going to take a kick. Selby is so meticulous in his planning. He takes a while over a pink to the middle, has a red cleaned, and 15-12 is in the post. Higgins takes the missed red, but there\u2019s no colour on, so it\u2019s back up to baulk. Everything looks safe, Higgins thinks everything\u2019s safe, but the finest cut - a paper cut? - and one close to the top cushion is deposited. What a pot that was. The green follows, the reds are spread, and this is a chance. Oh, Wizard! A careless break leaves a cut to the middle, and down it goes. The brown follows, the pack is cannoned, and there\u2019s a red at the bottom which goes. Those reduced arrears might not stay reduced long, except Selby misses the pot! Is he still farklempt about that last frame? Higgins misses the green, but has done enough. Back in the game! Should Selby have really taken on that red? If he missed it, Higgins was always likely to be on it and, as they say, never give a genius an even break. Perhaps it\u2019s become too natural for Selby, because he\u2019s usually far more ruthless than that. He plays it! But gets so close that he leaves it when he misses! Higgins sinks it, and that\u2019s the frame! There\u2019s one red left, on the side cushion, and Selby disturbs it after potting the black. But he remonstrates with the Gods strongly when it rolls just the wrong side of the middle pocket; will he try and jam in behind, sending it towards the yellow pocket! This feels like almost a match ball! And still there\u2019s a red left, but Selby catches the near jaw and leaves another plant. This time, Higgins ignores it entirely but plays his safety too hard and Selby cracks it home. I fear for the Wiz if he contrives to lose this frame. Oh dear. Higgins gambles, doesn\u2019t finish on a red, and has to try a plant on frame-ball! Why did he play it so hard! Safety in mind I suppose, but hit more slowly and that was in! \u201cDidn\u2019t catch that pink full in face, needs some luck, he\u2019s had some! HE\u2019S HAD SOME!\u201d Higgins finishes on a red though the cannon into the cluster doesn\u2019t go as planned, and surely the frame is now his and the night is now ours! Selbz uses side to try and coax the white off the side cushion and into the cluster, but hits the pink. So he\u2019s put back, and trying to compensate, over-compensates! He slips past the pack by a fraction, leaves a red, and Higgins is in! Selby hits the pack nicely with his second shy but Higgins retorts well, sneaking in behind the broon. This frame is unbearably essential for him. The aforementioned kick. Higgins plays a fine safety shot, leaving TJFL behind the yellow - he tries to roll into the cluster, but his effort doesn\u2019t reach. PS did you know that science has not yet explained the phenomenon of bad contacts? Me neither. Egad! On 24 and in the balls, Higgins gets a kick; of course he does. So the white goes onto the top cushion, but can he wipe his mind free of injustice? Selby is looking so smooth, strolling around removing balls. But a careless positional shot leaves him the wrong side of the blue, he takes on a difficult yellow because he\u2019s in the zone, and cues so far cross it he\u2019s almost in the crowd. Higgins can\u2019t have expected another go here, let alone from just 22 points behind. \u201cCome on John, what\u2019ve you got left,\u201d demands Hendry. Higgins has no choice but to nestle into the pack, problem being there are loose reds about. And he leaves one, long into the green pocket or gentle into the middle - Selby opts for the latter and gives it just enough. But when Selby cannons the pack off the black, finishes on nothing, and plays a dodgy safety. Higgins can now attack, opening the pack and getting back to baulk in a bid to force the error. Except he doesn\u2019t get a good cue-ball, hitting it too hard, so Selby duly sticks him behind the yellow. This boys and men, I\u2019m afraid. Higgins plays a red as a shot to nothing, misses it thick with safety in mind ... and Selby pots yet another great long one. Selby sinks the black to leave Higgins needing snookers, and that is going to hurt. He was brave to take on the pink, brilliant to pot it, and still it didn\u2019t happen. A run of 37 is enough for Selbo, and my word, he\u2019s stretching for hame. But with scored 22, he runs out of position potting the black, and so miffed is he that he plays a careless safety shot, - the cue-ball is short and a red is available. Selby raps in a long one, and it\u2019s hard to see him missing before a frame-clinching advantage is racked up. Hendry is encouraging Higgins to be aggressive, he is, and it works! He cues beautifully to pot a difficult pink across the other side of the table and into the top-right, enjoys a favourable cannon, and is now favourite for the frame. Concentration required. But what\u2019s this! Selby misses a red maybe half a foot from the top-right pocket - the left-hand side took it against the jaw - and Higgins sends one into the yellow pocket. It\u2019s a good pot, but he\u2019s just top-side of the blue, so it\u2019s not entirely clear from where the next red is coming. \u201cJust\u201d the 35 for Selby - he runs out of position and shoves the white off the yellow and close to the bottom cushion. Can Higgins retaliate with a taxing safety? ... No. He clips the broon and sits resignedly back in his chair. \u201cA heated clothes horse?! You\u2019re snacking on grissini and home-made hummus right now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d chides yerman Wall. I\u2019ve got concede, I\u2019d love to make my own hummus, but I\u2019ve been forbidden from using our Vitamix for such purposes. Green juice and other non-fragrant things only. But, while we\u2019re here, some advice: instead of buying the grainy, lemony supermarket version, find your nearest Kosher shop or section and enjoy the thick, smoothness, hummus how it\u2019s meant to be. This might be the guardienest post ever. Selby digs into the pack immediately, and it doesn\u2019t quite work out. He has to cut a tricky red, so, er, he cuts a tricky red. He is buzzing! Higgins leaves a tempter - it\u2019s the only one that\u2019ll be available if Selby misses. Selby doesn\u2019t come close to missing, \u201cright in the heart of the pocket\u201d. There can be no greater endorsement. And there it is: \u201cthe first frame is crucial for John Higgins,\u201d revelates Hendry. Out come the boys, to Killer - sounded like Adamski\u2019s version, far superior to Seal\u2019s. But we\u2019ll have to make do with this. \u201cAs you suggested earlier,\u201d emails David Wall, \u201cthis one looks as though it will go a long time so, assuming there will be plenty of extended periods of safety play (as well as each of the players popping out for comfort breaks between frames), perhaps you could dish more of your Shoot!-style dirt. For instance, who do you sit next to in the dressing room (on the Guardian sports desk)? Which MBM/ OBO/ FBF-er inspired you when growing up? What\u2019s your favourite mid-session interval snack? And what job would you have had if you\u2019d not found work watching, and writing pithy descriptions of various sporting events? It\u2019ll help us all stay calm when the match reaches Line-of-Duty-levels of tension later on.\u201d Ha ha. We don\u2019t have set seats, though I am currently at home, next to my proudest recent acquisition: a heated clothes hoss. And I did once have what a job, in the loosest possible sense: trainee lawyer in a City firm. You can learn all about how good I was at it, here: But it\u2019s churlish to whinge if Selby powers through, because what a show he\u2019s giving us. It\u2019s the way he combines opposites that\u2019s so brilliant - invention and attrition, attack and defence, risk and caution. He is going to win a lot of these. \u201cThe first [insert relevant unit of measurement here] is so important\u201d - a staple of sporting cliche. But rarely has it been so pertinent as right very now, with John Higgins is on the slide and Mark Selby on the charge. From 10-4 behind, Selby has won nine of ten frames, and if he can extend his lead to three immediately, any r&amp;r that Higgins has contrived in the short break will immediately evaporate. He looked tired and put-upon this afternoon, while Selby looked raffish and rakish; it\u2019s hard to see how he might turn that around, yet, on the other hand, well though Selby played, the ball ran in his favour and still the frames were tight. Boyz/baize interface: roughly 7pmBST So, I\u2019m away, but join me again at 6.45ish for further wonderment. Don\u2019t get too vexed with actual real people in the meantime. So that\u2019s a session, and what a session for Mark Selby, who has been expletive brilliant. Early on, his safety play set the tone, and after the mid-session he started cueing beautifully; this is pretty much what happened to Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan in the 2014 final, and just like him, Higgins looks thoroughly despondent and befuddled. Higgins looks tired, you\u2019ve got to say, and maybe he had a rough night\u2019s kip, allowing 10-4 to become 10-7. Selby has now won this session 6-1, and finds himself in a position he can barely have conceived of this morning, never mind last evening. \u201cHave a shower and try and brush himself down,\u201d recommends Jayvee when wondering how Higgins should spend the impending break. Ahem. \u201cYou get a sense of your opponent wilting under pressure, and it\u2019s about pouncing,\u201d says Hendry with menace. Selby, meanwhile, overhits a couple in his zealousness to get things sorted, but it doesn\u2019t really matter - he simply responds with a great shot. Uh-oh. Higgins plays yet another nasty safety, and leaves an easy red for Selbo, which he takes. What previously looked like a cuticle-carver is beginning to look like a procession. Giving a great of this ilk, in his prime, a two-frame start going into the final session of a world championship? Not for me, JV. Higgins looks like he wants someone to indicate the way to his habitual abode, for he\u2019s fatigued and has a desire to retire. But Selby does miss, and Higgins concedes. This is simply magical from the Jester, who from 10-4 now leads; that\u2019s eight of nine frames. Higgins needs Selby to miss, though the frame is now secure, so he can waste time and avoid another frame. That does not look so likely. Andrew Benton is back with gardening info: \u201cI used to work in a garden centre - the first May bank holiday was always the busiest. Anyway, gardening\u2019s like snooker, lots of green, and plenty of potting.\u201d Ah. I thought there was something that happened in the atmosphere or somesuch. Which means we\u2019ll get another frame this afternoon. Selby hasn\u2019t led since frame 3. Mistake from Higgins lets Selby in - he needs 46 more points to secure the frame, and it looks inconceivable that he\u2019ll not get them. But too much topspin potting a black he might\u2019ve stunned leaves the white against the pack and no colour on, end of break, at 24. We\u2019re in rerack territory, but a loose safety from Higgins followed by a loose one from Selby splays reds all over the show instead. The first chance will be a good one now. \u201cBelieve, believe, believe,\u201d says Selby to himself, eyeing-up Higgins as Higgins breaks off. And what a red he immediately smashes home, then a black, then a red which gently fans the pack. If he can see this away in one visit, we\u2019ll sneak in another frame this session, the last thing that Higgins needs. All square! Selby very carefully and very brilliantly rolls home a far from straightforward red, plays safe, and Higgo concedes! That\u2019s seven of the last eight, and what a visit that 67 was! He\u2019s so clever and calm in the balls. Selby pots a tricky red - he thought about leaving it, but it was frame ball, so on it was taken, and down it went. The break is 67, the black is missed, and Higgins is back at the table, 48 behind with 43 available; two snookers required. \u201cIn my work pool league we affectionately refer to an attempt at a full length-of-the-table double into the corner as a \u2018John\u2019 in honour of the great man*. What would be Selby\u2019s signature shot? *New laws prevent us from hosting unofficial videos, but Higgins played a beauty on the brown to steal the 2010 UK Championship from Mark Williams MBE. Selby\u2019s would either be the straight double across the table, or anything involving revolting cue-power. He\u2019s actually a really interesting kind of player - all the pool tricks, but the temperament and acumen of Steve Davis. There\u2019s nothing on for Higgins, so he\u2019s forced to play the pot and misses. Selby quickly drains a red, then gets beautiful action on the white to see away yellow, dragging the cue-ball all the way down the table. He then makes a mess of a red, but it only leaves him on the black, and suddenly, this a serious frame-winning opportunity! Higgins leaves a tempter to the middle - not really a tempter, actually, rather a chance. Selby misses, and Hendry explains that when the big colours are tied up, as they are, you\u2019re not as enthusiastic about the pot. Housekeeping: we won\u2019t start a frame after 5.15, so by the looks of things we\u2019ll be at least two short in this session. Tonight is going to be an absolute monster, all the more so if Higgins can get himself in front. Anyhow, Higgins was first in with 19, and we\u2019re now enveloped in a safety exchange. Or rather, we\u2019ve been back a few minutes, but my everything crashed. And we\u2019re back. So Selby wins the mini-session 3-1, probably the minimum that either player would have accepted. It is thrilling, tense, dramatic, wonderful stuff; I\u2019ll see you on the other side of the mid-session. In the meantime, here\u2019s some reading on the joy of the world championships and why snooker is like Sopranos. Selby leaves a taxing yellow and Higgins takes it on, missing - and flicking the pink to leave it! Down it goes, then a fine pot to sink the green, and after 45 minutes, here we are! I\u2019m not having Higgins as Nadal after all - it took him too long to win his first world title. He\u2019s more Murray, but older. It looks like Selby has left a cuttable red, but Higgins taps the table and plays safe. Two shots later, perhaps he wishes he hadn\u2019t, because Selby spanks home a long red. But he needs position on the yellow, just above the brown which is on its spot, and doesn\u2019t really have the angle on the blue. The pink is another option but that\u2019s a much harder pot, so he takes the blue, can\u2019t get position, and has to play safe. I know I\u2019ve said this before, but whoever pots the yellow... \u201cHaving not followed the snooker for a few years I found myself wondering if John Higgins has already been through the redemption narrative of winning the big cup after his \u2018troubles,\u201d emails Ian Copestake. Higgins isn\u2019t quite that guy - this is more like Rafa Nadal winning a slam or somesuch. This is now the longest frame of the match, up at 35 minutes. Whoever pots this final red should win it, with all the colours nicely set - the score is 40-37 Higgins. Oh, shot! Higgins leaves a long pot, which Selby hammers into the top-left. And he\u2019s even got an angle on the green to disturb the remaining red, sat on the top cushion. The green duly goes into the middle, but the cannon on the red isn\u2019t hard enough so it\u2019ll be a thin contact and back into baulk. He plays it beautifully, the green, blue and pink all in the road ... but Higgins responds with a beaut of his ain! The balls, the balls! Higgins plays a red off the side cushion to send it down the table, it flicks the blue, and goes in the hole! Then he pots the blue, only to cue horribly across one with the rest - it goes in anyway - and so does another blue. But the two remaining reds are on the top cushion, so it\u2019s end of break; whoever has the better of the upcoming safety exchange will likely win the frame. \u201cSelby is the first player since Hendry who loses a session but you still just shrug and know that he\u2019ll win anyway,\u201d emails Greg Phillips. Yep, I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably so. If he can win today, and even if he doesn\u2019t, he looks ready to dominate. This is really tough work for Higgins, and his break ends when he plays a run-through on a red - a stun would\u2019ve left him on a colour. So, Selby is back at the table and leads 33-28 in what is a vital frame, even more vital than all the other vital frames. Higgins rolls into the pack and Selby spends quite some time evaluating whether or not a red is on, cueing from inside the cluster and cutting to the top-right. He\u2019s certain that it is but can\u2019t satisfy himself, then he does, and then he misses it! Higgins now has a chance for 12-9, which would leave us where we were at the start of play. A safety exchange is delicately ended with a blinder of a pot from the champ. The white is up in baulk, green side, and he plays towards the middle to clip a red back towards that same green side, top corner. Brilliant! But he finishes on nowt, so puts Higgins behind the green. Higgins catches a safety shot too thick, cannoning a red, but this time it\u2019s him with the run - it pulls up close to the cushion and baulk line on the yellow side. Selby runs out of position, so his break ends at 32. \u201cAs you surely know, Gardener\u2019s World got bumped off BBC2 by the snooker on Friday,\u201d emails Andrew Benton, \u201cand what a Friday to do so, on the cusp of the most important gardening weekend of the year. To make amends for this, could you do a MBM of next week\u2019s Gardeners World, please.\u201d What makes it the most important weekend of the year? But I\u2019d love to, and while we\u2019re here, not doing the final of University Challenge will go down as my biggest disappointment, whenever I get to do one of the questionnaires they used to ask footballers in Shoot! and Match. Selby is obviously deeply troubled by that previous frame; he\u2019s just picked out a terrific plant - the two balls where not close to one another - and a kiss on the brown allows him to pot that and proceed back up the table for more points. Maximum breaks have become a bit of a thing - Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan pretty much failed to make one on purpose earlier in the week - so here\u2019s Barry Hearn having his say. Selby will be aghast to have lost that frame - two despicable misses made that possible - but there won\u2019t be many times in his career that John Higgins has lost six frames in a row, so what can you do. The Wiz is making hard work work work work work of this, but he clings on and compiles a crucial clearance of 78. One good cannon and this is done, but so profoundly is Selbo focused on achieving it that he forgets to sink the black! Higgins is back, and knows he daren\u2019t miss. Selby cuts in a red, played as shot to nothing, and whaddaya know! As skill would have it, he\u2019s on the black! It\u2019s a weird one, too - he sets it off nice and slowly towards the middle, it looks like it\u2019s not going in, and gradually it curves towards the edge of the pocket. Big chance for all-square now. Except this is Mark Selby we\u2019re talking about, which means Higgins is soon behind the yellow and \u201ctapping the table in appreciation\u201d. His escape is close, but not close enough and still a foul and a miss; there\u2019s mirth and hilarity and Jan Verhaas is helped replace the ball by the marker. Eventually, Iggins is in position to miss again, potting the white off the brown, more chuckles and chortles, and he does it again! It\u2019s Biggus Dickus territory now, folk creasing and corpsing all over the show, and this time Iggins gets his flick and the exchange recommences. Faced with the choice of easy blue or missable pink, Higgins chooses the former, but with more work to do with the white, he cannons the brown. The break is 29, but that\u2019s all it is; an excellent safety shot, played while hampered by the yellow, puts him in a strong position to stop the rot. The Wizard is rolling now, a lovely recovery red cut home, followed by a yellow into its own pocket that he uses to cannon the pack. The split does badly, but he manufactures a delicate pot, striking down, nonetheless. Higgins can scarcely believe his mazel! He cracks in a red to the green pocket, so beautifully that the \u201cand it\u2019s there!\u201d rings out well before it goes in. Selby looks like he\u2019s had 63 pints of snakebite followed by a bucket chaser. Oy gevalt! Selby is so focused on getting the white around the back of the cluster to the black, he only goes and misses the red! Oh dear. Higgins wades into a long red, hits it much too thick, and leaves it as an easy starter into the opposite middle. Steve says Higgins is \u201closing it a bit\u201d, but just as much, Selby is selbying and the balls have run in his favour. Higgins sinks the loose red, but has to double the black; he misses, and that\u2019s five on the spin! Higgins leaves the arena, and desperately needs this next frame. This has been an excellent run - Dennis has never seen a frame like it, so it\u2019s fair to say you haven\u2019t either. He finishes on 40, the compilation of which took eight minutes. Higgins is now back at the table, 51 behind with 52 available. But the black is on one side cushion, the pink on the other, one red kissing the green and one on the bottom cushion. Selby is working this break out really well - of course, he needs more reds than normal because he\u2019s taking low-value colours, the blue, pink and black being tied up. It seems no sort of problem. Talking of books read as a child, this one, Secrets From The School Underground, basically taught me everything I needed to know - and some things I probably didn\u2019t need to know that I absolutely needed to know, aged 10. It\u2019s still brilliant now. There is now one red roundabout the pink spot, and the rest all above it. It reminds me of a book I read as kid, The Boy With Illuminated Measels. Anyway, Higgins wobbles one in the jaws of the yellow pocket - it\u2019s a decent effort - only for it to cruise all the way over to the yellow pocket, and Selby is up sharply. It\u2019s beginning to look a lot like 10-8. On the other hand, we may be here no time at all. One mistake, and the frame is done. There are now seven reds in the baulk half of the table, and they\u2019re playing into and out of the morsels which comprise the cluster. We may be here a while. That last frame was the longest of the match so far; we now look set for another of similar ilk, as they exchange containing safety. Selby plays a terrific shot to crack the pack, with ridiculous power off the bottom cushion and back down again. But then he misses a straightforward red with only eight points on the board ... only to leave nothing! The run of the balls is in his favour this afternoon. What on earth! Higgins absolutely slams the black, catches the near knuckle, and Selby is back at the table! What was Higgins thinking? Excellent safety shot from Selby, but he\u2019s left a red, and what a pot from Higgins! He cues this beautifully - the object ball is about halfway between the white and the pocket. All he has to do now is deal with the black, clip the bottom of the cluster, and he\u2019s in! Very quickly, the white is nestled in the reds, and they\u2019re playing away and back in; prime rerack territory. But then Higgins plays back up to the baulk line and we\u2019re back to normal. Hazel Irvine whispering minds me of a time in Primary School when the headmaster retired. The deputy head told us to bring in cash to buy him a present, whispering in the process; he was in Israel at the time. Higgins barely had a look at a pot in that frame. He badly needs to chap himself the next one. Selby wants to win this session apparently. And he also wanted to win the first frame. Similarly, the first hour is crucial. Driiiiiiink! We\u2019ve had our first \u201cWHERE\u2019S THE CUE BALL GOING?!\u201d of the day. The answer is in the yellow pocked, and Selbz will now deposit at least as many points as he needs to win his fourth frame in a row. Selby can\u2019t build much of a break, but he\u2019s close to having the frame secure - all the more so when excess side has Higgins clattering into the brown. There are balls scattered all over, but Selby doesn\u2019t put him back - oh how the crowd chortle when JV suggests he does - and a further safety exchange ensues. A poor safety from Higgins has Selby back at the table, and after a red and a pink, he plays a lovely shot striking down on the cue ball to keep the break going. \u201cThe best I\u2019ve ever seen with awkward bridging,\u201d says Dennis Taylor. I might just copy that to my clipboard, given how many times I\u2019ve learnt it this week. Selby wobbles in a pink - it takes four turns around the jaw before it finally relents - but quickly runs out of position, so plays safe. The break was 21, and he now leads 31-1. \u201cAfternoon Daniel,\u201d tweets Stuie Neale. \u201cThink this may go late but I don\u2019t think too late. I think Higgins will win 18-12.\u201d I\u2019d be surprised if he won today 8-5. Selby is the best in the world and has been playing like it - if Higgins wins, it\u2019ll be much closer, I\u2019d expect. Higgins takes on a pot - the red is close to the top cushion and near the top right. It looks impossible for him to overcut it - if he hits it, it\u2019s in. Except he does overcut it, Selby then rolls another red into it and he\u2019s away! Selby misses a red into the middle, but played as a shot to nothing, and when Higgins is too pacey with his resultant safety, there\u2019s a red on. But Selby misses into the top-left - he\u2019s in big trouble now! Except he\u2019s not because a noble-double-kiss - a quadruple kiss - a double-kiss squared - leaves the white in the jaws of the top-right. After some time taken to ponder - and were there a world championship of the same, Selby would be a leading contender - he opts not to open the pack any further, probably wise given how trickily things are now set. So he takes a red with a green, then another red, and tucks in behind the blue, on the side cushion, green side. The break was 10 and there shall begin a \u201cfascinating safety exchange\u201d. This is going to be so good. Selby catches a red far too thin - far too thinly, I should say - but Higgins quickly knocks in a red. But then he jaws a tough blue, and though it - along with the black - is now out of commission - the pink is in play. There is, though, a serious quantity of werk to be done. \u201cWatching the snooker on German TV because that is \u201cwie ice rolle,\u201d emails Ian Copestake. \u201cIts always a pleasure to listen to the legendary snooker commentator Rolf Kalb, who in terms of enthusiasm makes Klopp sound unhappy...\u201d It\u2019s funny you should say that. When Selby was busy beating Ronnie in 2014, Liverpool were busy collapsing against Crystal Palace - a bad night for Steve Peters. And tonight, they visit Watford; spooky, eh? Higgins leaves Selby a tempter, but he eschews; it\u2019s going to be a long day. Get in! Selby breaks off. He\u2019s even money, with Higgins 8/11. And out comes the Jester. Out comes \u2018Iggins... When Selby beat Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan in 2013, Selby was 10-7 down overnight. The difference there was the deficit should\u2019ve been much, much worse, but the performance he delivered on day 2 was phenomenal. It was perhaps the first time O\u2019Sullivan was beaten when he really didn\u2019t want to be. Housekeeping: first to 18 wins, so Higgins needs another eight and Selby needs another 11. Right then, here we go! \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to think of reasons he won\u2019t win it and I can\u2019t come up with any.\u201d Thus spake Stephen Hendry of Mark Selby, and at the time, it seemed bang on; and even if it didn\u2019t, who is anyone ever to exist in the entire history of existence to argue with him? But Hendry had reckoned without two very important things: the will and skill of John Higgins, which have very few equals in any sport. In the first two-thirds of yesterday\u2019s play, Higgins, one of the few players in history capable of matching Selby\u2019s tactical pecking, absolutely put it on him; without a late fightback, we\u2019d be preparing for a coronation, and hoping for any kind of session this evening. Except there was a fightback, of course there was; no one puts Selby in the corner. So the world\u2019s best player and defending champion fought back to reduce the deficit to a manageable three frames, which was good of him because, for those of simply hoping to consume a day and a night with compelling theatre, the score is precisely where we would have put it. So, close the curtains, shun or evangelise your family and friends, and luxuriate in the unbearable lightness of potting.
