College Kent Institute of Art &amp; Design. Course HND in fashion design. Attended 1992-1994. A tutor recalls \"Wal\u00e9 was very popular. He did an awful lot for the college, running fashion shows and getting involved with group projects. He'd gather information from his friends about what they wanted. He wasn't too happy on projects that weren't related to his interests. Music was his influence - in those days we had bass rooms and he was always in there playing loud hip-hop. He became a window-dresser when he left and did some retail work for Head Over Heels in Covent Garden. He set up a market stall in Camden and went into Urban Outfitters in 1997.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
