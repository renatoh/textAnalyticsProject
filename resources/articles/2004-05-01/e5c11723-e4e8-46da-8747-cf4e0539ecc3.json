The departure of the former Manchester United No2 was inevitable after Real Madrid's disappointing season, which they finished empty-handed on Sunday night. A 4-1 home defeat to Real Sociedad capped the club's worst run of five successive defeats. It also set a record of four consecutive home defeats. \"It hurts us deeply. We cannot let it happen again,\" said president Florentino P\u00e9rez. The president, who also announced the signing of Roma centre-back Walter Samuel for \u00a322m, said he had made a \"mistake\" signing Queiroz. After a disastrous two months in which Madrid slipped from an eight-point lead at the top of the table to fourth place, P\u00e9rez accused Queiroz of \"lacking the moral authority and discipline\" to get the best out of Madrid. Queiroz has been criticised for failing to rotate, leaving his players burnt out. But this failure was more a product of the absurdly short squad he had inherited, exacerbated by 11 summer departures, notably that of Claude Makelele, the defensive midfielder David Beckham had to replace. Camacho will be a new departure for Real Madrid, whose policy has been one of granting players extreme freedom, thus inadvertently undermining the coach's authority and imposing must-play players on the first XI. Camacho will certainly not accept impositions. His strong personality was an outstanding feature of his time as Spain coach but he has the ability to get the best out of his players, winning the Portuguese Cup with Benfica this season. Thierry Henry is set to become the first Frenchman to win the Golden Shoe as Europe's top scorer with his goals for Arsenal. The final list will not be issued until mid-June when all the leagues have been completed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
