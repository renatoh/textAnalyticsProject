It means he can now ride on Boxing Day at Kempton, where he is due to partner the Martin Pipe-trained Therealbandit in the King George It is because there are Grade One races on Sunday that the Irishman can defer his suspension until the following day, so he will miss the meeting at Wetherby (where Pipe's Well Chief could run in the Castleford Chase) but he will be able to ride in the Coral Welsh National next Tuesday. Murphy was originally suspended by Plumpton stewards on December 13 after he threw his whip in frustration at Semi Precious after falling from that horse and failing to catch it. After his appeal the jockey, who rides for the champion owner David Johnson, said: \"It was a very fair hearing. I was disappointed when I got a seven-day ban - I thought it was too much for what I'd done. I feel justice has been done and I got what I deserved.\" Adding that he fully understood the club's concern for the welfare of horses, he added: \"I think the Jockey Club are correct to do as much as they can [to protect horses], but a small bit of sense has to come into it somewhere down the line.\" The disciplinary panel viewed the race video and heard evidence from Murphy before making their decision. Malcolm Wallace, director of regulation at the Jockey Club, in explaining some of the factors the panel had considered, said: \"It was improper riding, but the panel accepted there was no abuse of the horse. You would not want every jockey every day to be throwing his whip at his horse. \"However, he did throw it with his left hand - and he is right-handed.\" - PA"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
