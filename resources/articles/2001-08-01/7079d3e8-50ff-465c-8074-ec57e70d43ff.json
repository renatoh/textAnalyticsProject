Answer: arguably the biggest auction of jaw-droppingly ostentatious household appliances, lavish building materials and ridiculously opulent toys ever assembled. The 330,000 residents of the tiny oil-rich sultanate of Brunei, on the northern coast of Borneo, have been gripped by the saga, and there was talk of little else this week as they prepared to witness the mother of all garage sales. Ten thousand lots worth millions of pounds are scheduled to go under the hammer from tomorrow in an eight-hours-a-day, six-day bidding frenzy. The prince in question is Jefri Bolkiah, a younger brother of the Sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah. His half-completed vision of nirvana is called Jerudong and the goods on offer are a fraction of those that his now bankrupt conglomerate, the Amedeo Development Corporation, was planning to use to build and furnish the remainder of the sprawling site. There is undoubtedly something for everyone here in the 21 warehouses, stacked floor to ceiling, and three overflowing car parks on the main site. If you're not after the 200 tonnes of finest Burmese teak, three yards full of marble, 100 gold-leaf chandeliers, thousands of items from the London jeweller Asprey or a state-of-the-art wood-turning machine, perhaps one of the hundreds of flashy European sofas, shelves full of gold-plated bathroom fittings, baby grand piano, full-size snooker table or solid granite Jacuzzi will catch your fancy. And for the really privileged, there's the chance to examine a Comanche attack helicopter simulator, a Formula One simulator, an Airbus A340 simulator, two Mercedes fire engines and the complete contents of a plaster factory. Neil Duckworth, a director of the British auctioneers, Smith Hodgkinson, says it's the scale of the goods that has amazed him. \"There's nothing that I've not dealt with in the past, but to have so much and so much variety on one site is a first for me.\" It is this size that offers the answer as to why the auction is happening at all; how it all went so badly wrong for Prince Jefri, known as PJ in Brunei. When PJ began work on Jerudong in 1992, he was the finance minister and head of the Brunei Investment Agency, and so had almost limitless access to funds. For five years it all went swimmingly - Amedeo built VIP housing complexes, a huge hotel, one of the world's largest fairgrounds and several industrial facilities. People flocked to the prince to seek a slice of the action. But the lines between what was his and his corporation's money on the one hand, and what were state funds on the other, became increasingly blurred. Eventually his brother - for reasons that are still unclear in among the very hush-hush elite of the country - decided enough was enough. PJ was sacked and the government took back the land. This left Amedeo with assets it did not really own, as it no longer controlled the land they were on. The inevitable consequence was bankruptcy - with the debts thought to total about 3bn pounds. How much went missing from the government coffers is not pre cisely known, but it is thought to be at least three times the debt. The sultan initially froze PJ's accounts, seized assets such as his yacht, named Tits (the tenders were called Nipple I and Nipple II), and the Dorchester hotel in London, and limited the monthly allowance for the prince, his four wives and 35 children to a paltry $300,000 (about 210,000 pounds). But then PJ struck lucky. Last year the government - which in reality means the sultan, as this constitutional monarchy has been under emergency rule since 1962 - dropped the legal action and settled with the prince. The terms of the settlement are not known, but the bottom line appears to be that it will be extremely difficult for PJ and Amedeo's outstanding creditors to recoup their losses. Most of the hundreds of people wandering around the lots this week were unconcerned by all this background. They had the look of deer caught in fast-approaching headlights as they tried to absorb the sheer scale of the auction. Most just couldn't believe their eyes. \"This is very, very super-luxurious. It's beyond my dreams just to see and touch some of these things,\" says Haji Othman, a local computer entrepreneur, as he caresses a 6ft-diameter whirlpool marble bath. Some people are mesmerised by the floor-to-ceiling stacks of toilets or shelf after shelf of bed boards. The marble, reckoned to be the most valuable commodity, also attracts a lot of interest. \"I heard that they finished a whole quarry in Italy to get a lot of this stuff,\" says Shona, an Australian expatriate. Almost everything on site is for sale. Most of the fork-lift trucks used to move the goods around will go, as will the chairs the bidders will sit on, the desk the auctioneer will use during the sale and the hard hats the staff will wear when carrying the bigger items around. \"There are some serious buyers here,\" says John Macnz, a Brunei-based Scottish architect who is bidding for a client. \"I've seen many government officials wandering around with huge lists and they're obviously interested in buying a lot of stock.\" One Singaporean woman, who declines to give her name, has flown in with her personal Italian interior designer. \"This is just too good an opportunity to miss,\" she says. Duckworth reckons 50% of the viewers are local, 30% from neighbouring countries in south-east Asia and the remainder from farther afield. \"The variety is there and the interest is there, and so it should be a good result.\" As with all liquidation auctions, there are plenty of bargains to be had. In one particularly musty warehouse are about 100 pieces of wood, labelled in the catalogue as \"logs\". \"These are actually sandalwood,\" Macnz says. \"They should go for a fortune, but I don't think the majority of people know what they're looking at.\" In the fine-quality furniture cavern are row upon row of casually displayed and certainly grand, but not particularly attractive, wardrobes. \"These should each go for about 20,000 pounds,\" Duckworth says calmly. Some of the stock is not actually in as mint condition as it might seem at first glance, however. \"The first time I saw it I thought, 'Wow!' and then the more you see it the more you think it's a waste,\" says Jin Lim, who works for a shipping company. \"There's a lot of rubbish as well, so it's a great deal of money down the toilet.\" Duckworth reckons only 10-20% is brand-new. Not only has much of the stuff been used - some of it is more than eight years old - but a lot of it has also been stored badly. \"The people in charge of the stuff just didn't know what to do,\" Macnz says. \"The result is that you've got stuff muddled up and all over the place.\" And then there was the flood. It is easy to see the marks on the walls from where the water rose more than a couple of feet two years ago and completely ruined many items. And some items that escaped the rising water have since succumbed to termites. In such circumstances, Smith Hodgkinson is not offering any guarantees. \"What you see is what you get,\" Duckworth says. \"We can't give any warranties because we don't know too much about the history of the stuff.\" The auction's rules are simple. You have to pay Brunei $1,000 (400 pounds) to register, and then you are eligible to bid. As nothing like this has ever happened in Brunei before, no one knows how people will react to the expected heightened atmosphere on the first morning of bidding. \"It'll probably take an hour or so for people to get into the swing of things,\" says Mark Issacs, one of Duckworth's assistants. \"But once people get used to it I expect it to all go quite quickly.\" No matter how much is raised - and most people estimate that it will be several million pounds - practically nothing is going to trickle back to the 300-odd Amedeo creditors who say they are owed about 400m pounds. \"This is just the odds and sods,\" says Peter Burke, an Australian architect who is seeking to recover about 1.3m pounds. \"But we're pushing the liquidators to go ahead with the auction now to enable other action to be taken.\" This other action is mostly in the courts. Eight lawsuits have already been filed against Prince Jefri and several more are pending. So the proceeds from the auction will be swallowed up by the bottomless pit of legal and liquidators' fees. No one knows where it will end, but one thing is for sure: this soap opera-cum-tragedy is going to run and run."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
