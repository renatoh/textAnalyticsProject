I think it will be, but not necessarily in the ways the secretary of state for education planned. Foremost in Blunkett's mind appeared to be his concern that universities in the UK should not be left in an educational backwater by the tide of globalisation. Allied to this was the utilitarian theme of higher education at the productive heart of the knowledge economy. You had to wait quite a while before you heard specifics about other core Labour policies of social inclusion, access and diversity - or the importance of research and intellectual development. Blunkett cast his introduction of undergraduate tuition fees and final abolition of the maintenance grant as a more progressive system of student support. But Scotland's return to a grant-and-loan system, and its scrapping of the up-front tuition fee in favour of a graduate endowment, suggests history will not view Blunkett's policies in such a positive light. While the Robbins report in the 1960s set out four aims (not in any rank order) of higher education - instruction in skills necessary for employment; promotion of the powers of the mind; the advancement of learning; and transmission of \"a common culture and common standards of citizenship\" - Blunkett's vision at Greenwich seemed to be much narrower: universities are chiefly there to drive the economy. He placed his speech in the context of landmarks such as the Robbins report and Tony Crosland's speech in 1965 on the development of the polytechnics - a \"defining moment for higher education\". Blunkett was caustic about the Conservatives' treatment of higher education in the eighties and the nineties. Yet it was under Kenneth Baker that the sector began huge expansion in student numbers, and the transformation from an elite to a mass system of higher education. Blunkett's speech launched two initiatives: the e-university and two-year foundation degrees. These reflect concerns about globalisation and the knowledge economy, in line with the maxim \"think globally, act locally\". The plan is that the e-university will support UK universities and other partners in the development and delivery of online programmes, and provide a gateway to learning materials and services for learners, such as tutorial support and student advice. Government support for a UK-wide online university would give the higher education sector the strength to compete internationally with the likes of the University of Phoenix, corporate universities and leading American US institutions such as MIT. The aim is for the e-university to be online by 2002. Meanwhile, the English higher education funding council is shortlisting private sector partners, selecting members of the crucial academic quality committee and chewing over responses from institutions to its business model. Some institutions, including those with their own plans for international online collaborations, have been critical. But others have thrown themselves into the venture. Academic leaders from universities such as York, Southampton, London, Kent, Cardiff, Manchester Metropolitan and Edinburgh have contributed to the project's steering group. But the presence of international big-hitters such as Oxford, Cambridge, University College London and Imperial College in the group would have strengthened the venture. The foundation degrees are to help plug the UK's intermediate skills gap - and help meet the government's target of 50% of 18-30-year-olds participating in higher education by 2010, widening access at the same time. The consortium-based approach involving further and higher education and employers could be a very positive development. The extent to which bids for the prototype courses for next year were oversubscribed shows the enthusiasm of the sector. But doubts remain about the real demand from employers for sub-degree qualifications, the academic rigour of the courses, and whether two years will be enough to develop knowledge and skills. What will Blunkett's legacy be? If the Greenwich speech is a defining moment in the history of higher education, for me it will be in terms of crystallising how the state views universities: as engines of the economy. I think the e-university initiative is an exciting venture: an example of the government being entrepreneurial on behalf of higher education. And if foundation degrees can combine vocational focus with academic rigour then they could meet an important need in the parts of the economy. But I doubt if either project will have the significance of the post-Robbins university expansion, or the development of Crosland's polytechnics - or the development of mass higher education under Baker, John MacGregor (remember him?) and Ken Clarke.

Globalisation continues to reshape our universities. Alliances have grown: Oxford, Princeton, Stanford and Yale have recently formed a virtual college for lifelong learning; Leeds, Sheffield, Southampton and York universities have announced a partnership with California, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin-Madison universities.The prime minister's ambition that we increase recruitment of international students is also being met. We have pressed ahead with new, vocationally-orientated foundation degrees. These degrees are being designed with employers, providing students with the mix of specialist knowledge, wider skills and academic underpinning that the labour market demands. They will form a central thrust of the expansion of higher education. Last November, the Higher Education Funding Council announced the 21 consortia of universities and colleges that will be offering the prototype degrees for the coming academic year in areas such as e-commerce, internet computing, chemical technology, property and construction. Online learning is central to the future of higher education. To ensure that UK universities can compete effectively in the global online learning market, I announced at Greenwich the creation of an e-universities venture - a partnership between higher education and the private sector to provide global online opportunities. The Higher Education Funding Council for England has made substantial progress and it is due to be launched next year. Sir Martin Harris has led a fundamental review of higher education careers advice and guidance, which will lead to the improvements I called for at Greenwich. Likewise, we will bring forward proposals for expanding work experience opportunities, just as we have done for student volunteering. My speech also covered the vital issue of widening access to higher education. I have since announced a new \u00a3150m access programme, the Excellence Challenge. This will create a coherent structure of support for bright young people from disadvantaged backgrounds who have the potential to enter higher education. It will provide summer schools, master classes, mentoring by undergraduates, financial incentives and better information and advice for young people from 13 onwards. Universities will also receive \u00a312m a year for recruitment officers, admissions training and so on, in addition to existing funds for widening participation. These new resources are part of nearly \u00a31bn extra for higher education by 2003-4. Funding per student will increase for the first time in well over a decade the first time next year, and expansion will be fully funded thereafter. Funding for research, business and community outreach, and capital facilities will also rise significantly. New resources for pay - rising to \u00a3170m in 2003-04 - have also been announced, so that high-quality staff can be recruited and retained. In total, funding from the Higher Education Funding Council for England will have increased by \u00a31.7 billion or 18% in real terms over the six years to 2003/4. Taken together, we have made substantial strides towards meeting the challenges I identified at Greenwich. In the coming years, this coherent programme will deliver the real improvements needed, in stark contrast to the uncosted and unfunded schemes of our political opponents.
