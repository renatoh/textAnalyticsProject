Was that it? It's been the coolest for 18 years, and not in a hip way. End of the summer holiday. Back to school. The leaves are turning brown and beginning to fall from the trees. The year is past its peak and the days are getting shorter. Still, the football season's under way. There's some good stuff on TV after summer's fallow period. And we may even get the odd bit of sunshine. So how have musicians and songwriters responded to the ninth month of the year, this transitional time? Recommend some September songs by posting a comment below, and I'll gather the best of them in a blog here next Thursday. The toolbox: * Listen to others' suggestions and add yours to a collaborative Spotify playlist * Guide to \"donds\", \"zedded\", and other strange words used by some of the RR regulars (courtesy of the Marconium) * The Marconium (blog containing a wealth of data on RR, including the songs that are \"zedded\") * The 'Spill (blog for the RR community) Please do: * Post your nominations before midday on Tuesday if you wish them to be considered. * Write a few lines advocating the merits of your choices. But please don't: * Post more than one third of the lyrics of any song. * Dump lists of nominations. If you must post more than two or three at once, please attempt to justify your choices."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
