Back in February, I went to hear Barack Obama speak in Baltimore, Maryland. I had seen Obama in person plenty of times before, and the rally was, on its face, unexceptional. It took place the day before the Maryland primary, a contest that elicited little media excitement because Obama was expected to win with ease (which he duly did). Yet there was something different about that day. Part of it was the sheer size of a crowd which, on a freezing cold Monday afternoon, filled up a 13,000-capacity arena in the port city. I stood in the media enclosure on the floor of the venue as Obama spoke. At one point, he assailed the Bush administration for its incompetence and inequity. The passage was a standard part of his stump speech at the time and was light on big applause lines. But, as it concluded, a small group somewhere over my right shoulder began to chant. \"It's your time,\" they shouted. The slogan was spontaneous, but it spread across the cavernous auditorium with astonishing speed. I turned and looked up into the stands. There were black and white and Hispanic faces, and they all looked transported. Thousands of index fingers were being thrust toward Obama. \"It's your time,\" the voices repeated, louder and more insistently. \"It's your time!\" Even Obama seemed startled. He smiled a little uncertainly. \"It's your time,\" he said eventually, stressing the middle word like a teacher delivering a gentle correction. Lamar Shields was one of the supporters in attendance that day. \"People want someone who feels connected to them \u2013 that feels their hunger, feels their pain,\" he told me afterwards. There would be many more dramatic moments as I followed the Obama campaign to its triumphant conclusion, yet that day in Baltimore sticks with me still. When the politician and his public told each other that it was their time, they were right. Only a candidate with Obama's extraordinary gifts could have overcome such outlandishly long odds to make it to the White House. His bid could only have gained traction in a year when a large swathe of the electorate had grown heartsick about the state of their country. Almost everyone has noted that Obama's candidacy offered a reminder of how appalling and aberrational the Bush years had been. That's true enough, yet it is also only half the story. In a grander sense, the young senator's campaign was also a powerful rebuttal to the ideas that so many people had come to wearily accept about politics itself. Just a year ago, political debate seemed to have become degraded and coarsened beyond repair. The candidate capable of mounting the most vicious attacks and mouthing the most patronisingly simple soundbites seemed to invariably prevail. The things that those of us who enthuse about America like to believe about it \u2013 that, for all its flaws, its commitment to opportunity and freedom and fairness outstrips that of any other nation \u2013 had come to look like relics of a distant past. And then came Obama. Not only did he \u2013 with his Kenyan father and the broken home of his childhood, his Arabic middle name and his black skin \u2013 win. He won with dignity. The Clintons played the race card on him, and he rose above it. Jeremiah Wright exploded onto the scene, and he responded with a speech that was conspicuous, above all, for the respect it showed for the public's intelligence. In the dying days, John McCain and his cohorts threw every smear and innuendo, and none of them worked. It's possible, of course, that all Obama's promise will curdle into compromise and disappointment. But even if that happens, it will never quite erase the wonder of his campaign. That campaign restored a faith in politics that most of us thought we had lost. On an unseasonably mild Chicago night last month, when a disembodied voice announced the next first family of the United States, and Barack, Michelle, Malia and Sasha Obama strode into the lights, it restored a faith in the United States too. America was, once again, a place where astounding things could happen.
