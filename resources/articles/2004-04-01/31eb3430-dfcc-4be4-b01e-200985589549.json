Not until the job is done'", "bodyText": "The Mirror Editorial, April 1 The scene from Falluja [on Wednesday] was like a scene from hell. It wasn't enough that four American civilians were killed. Their bodies were hacked to pieces, decapitated, burned and strung up ... the mob cheered, danced and celebrated over the mangled remains. At around the same time and not far away, five US servicemen were killed by a bomb A total of nine dead in one more bloody day in Iraq ... President George Bush will be increasingly worried at what effect the daily slaughter is having on his re-election prospects. But his real concern should be how he is going to extricate the US and Britain ... How can order be restored by forces who are so despised? And how can the country be rebuilt when there is such loathing of foreign contractors?\" Mirror Globe and Mail Editorial, Toronto, April 1 After seeing the horrific images from Falluja, [many Americans] will decide that the United States has no business in a far-off country where it is not wanted. That would be a tragic mistake. The thugs who attacked these innocent contractors and disfigured their corpses are in no way representative of the Iraqi people, most of whom will be as horrified as Americans at what happened. The attack took place in the home region of Saddam Hussein, which resents his overthrow and the US-led occupation. Even there, the insurgents are a vicious minority, made up, it seems, of former regime elements, perhaps allied with foreign terrorists ... Having deposed the old regime, the occupiers have an obligation to usher Iraq safely into a better future ... For the Americans to cut and run now, as they did a decade ago in Somalia, would be a disaster for the Iraqi people, the region and the world. Globe and Mail New York Post Editorial, April 1 Clearly, the thugs hope to replay events in Somalia a decade ago: Back then, militia fighters ambushed US troops, killing 18 and dragging some of their corpses through the streets of Mogadishu - and President Bill Clinton quickly pulled America's forces out of the country. This time, America's not going anywhere. Not until the job is done ... The US mission in Iraq must - and will - prevail. Not just because Iraqis will benefit - which, of course, they will. But also because the establishment of freedom and democracy there eventually can help transform the region into something other than a breeding ground for terror. That's in America's interest. And the world's. New York Post Independent Editorial, April 1 These latest attacks were filmed in all their vicious detail. With a greater or lesser degree of censorship, they were broadcast around the world ... In the US ... condemnation, bitterness and anger will be the predictable and justified response. The question, however, is whether the US response stops there ... This is dangerous political territory for the Bush administration, even with the election a full seven months away. Until now, domestic support for US engagement in Iraq has declined only slowly ... [The] slaughter in Falluja may of may not be the event that galvanises a movement to get Americans out of Iraq. And it may or may not be the event that by itself accelerates erosion of public trust in Mr Bush. But it undoubtedly brings this prospect closer. Independent (subscription) Detroit Free Press Editorial, April 1 Wednesday's awful images will surely increase the public angst over the American forces in Iraq, but there should be no calls to cut and run. This is a fight that we started and will have to finish, unpleasant as it will be. The great majority of the Iraqi people - who long for safety, jobs, electricity and running water - deserve that much. The terrorists, the Hussein loyalists, the angry Ba'athists, whoever made up that horrific mob that won the television battle on Wednesday, simply cannot be allowed to prevail in this war. That would be a terrible waste of 600 lives. Detroit Free Press Denver Post Editorial, April 1 Sadly, many civilians killed in the attacks - including the four who died Wednesday - were in Iraq to help the Iraqi people. Among other things, they have been rebuilding drinking-water systems, restoring electrical power and repairing roads. By attacking these workers, the terrorists are not only testing international resolve, they are also attacking the Iraqi people ... Security must be beefed up for civilian contractors. In the long term, though, the best way to deter such attacks is to deny the terrorists their desired result. By using words that show American determination, President George W Bush and his Democratic opponent, Senator John Kerry, have signaled to terrorists that the strategy of mayhem and horror cannot succeed. Denver Post Wall Street Journal Editorial, April 1 [The killing of the] civilian contractors in Falluja should serve as a wake-up call to the occupation forces that democracy will have a hard time taking root in Iraq so long as justice takes a holiday ... Not a single one of the thousands of Iraqis and jihadists detained for plotting or participating in attacks on coalition forces and civilians has so far been visibly punished ... There are worries that the military trial and execution of the irregular combatants - amply justified by the accepted laws of war and occupation - would only inflame the already restive Sunni Triangle, and perhaps the Arab world generally ... But a year without justice has also been a year without enough deterrence, and Fallujans now have more reason to fear the consequences of working with the Americans than the consequences of killing them ... There's been much armchair speculation in the U.S. about whether a larger occupation force would have helped. One thing's for sure: No number of extra troops would have made much difference so long as we feared meting out punishment for fear of giving offence. Wall Street Journal (subscription) Chicago Tribune Editorial, April 1 It matters that Bush is not a Clintonian president, shaping and reshaping policy according to the public's mood swings. More important, though, we Americans are a different people. We have had the chilling opportunity to think through the years-long series of attacks - foreign and domestic - that are encapsulated by the brief phrase 'Sept 11' ... Whatever forces killed these nine Americans, and the many Americans before them who have been slain in Iraq, need to be destroyed. That has not happened quickly enough to halt attacks such as Wednesday's. It is, though, happening surely enough that those who derived their power from Hussein's cruel reign correctly see themselves as an endangered species. Over time, they will be defanged--provided Americans resist the urge to cut and run. Chicago Tribune"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
