The terms of reference for a Treasury review of the NHS, published yesterday, reveal the government is committed to maintaining access based on clinical need, not ability to pay. Derek Wanless, the former chief executive of NatWest who is in charge of the review, is expected to recommend that spending on the NHS will need to rise faster than economic growth to keep up with an ageing population and advancing medical techniques. An interim report will be released later in the autumn, according to Whitehall sources, and could pave the way for chancellor Gordon Brown to announce higher taxes to fund better public services in the November pre-budget report. The requirements of Mr Wanless's review, released by the Treasury, ask him to \"identify the key factors which will determine the financial and other resources required to ensure that the NHS can provide a publicly funded, comprehensive, high-quality service available on the basis of clinical need and not ability to pay.\" The full report will be released in April next year, in time for the next comprehensive review of public spending. Spending ministers are putting in bids now, and with the chancellor's war chest nearly exhausted, fiscal experts warn that taxes will have to rise to meet Labour's pledge to make improving public services the focus of its second term. Mr Brown hinted in his speech last week to the Labour party conference that tax rises may be necessary, when he spoke of \"building public support for budget and spending decisions we will have to make in the coming months\". Experts at the Institute of Fiscal Studies calculated ahead of the election that Mr Brown would have to find an extra \u00a35bn a year through higher taxes and borrowing to keep public spending rising at current rates. Health, education and social security spending are the key budget areas, because they consume a rising share of public spending. Health experts and academics will discuss the pressures on the NHS at a conference later this month, organised by the Treasury. Chief among them are the rising numbers of elderly people, new and more expensive treatment options and the need for better pay and conditions to recruit and retain medical staff. Mr Wanless is expected to argue that the worst case scenarios for NHS spending are exaggerated, but that significant real-term increases will be necessary over a number of years. Spending on the NHS increased by 4.8% a year after inflation during Labour's first term, according to the IFS, considerably higher than the average 3.5% a year increase the NHS has received over its entire history. The planned increases in the three years to March 2004 average 5.7%. However, even after these large budget increases, spending on the NHS will still not meet Tony Blair's pledge of matching the EU average, according to the IFS. \"Assuming that the UK private sector and spending elsewhere in the EU remain constant as a share of national income, the gap between the UK and average spending in 2003-4 will still be equivalent to 1.3% of GDP, or \u00a313.3bn,\" the IFS said in its analysis of Labour's spending record, released in March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
