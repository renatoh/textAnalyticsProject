If this will be no easy task then at least they have the memory, some of them, of doing just that the last time they played here four years ago, albeit by the skin of their teeth and a Michael Vaughan century. More of the same might be required for, after Mahela Jayawardene had called a halt to a day of torment for the bowlers, Chaminda Vaas removed Alastair Cook in his opening over, just as he did in the first innings, leaving Vaughan and James Anderson, in as a nightwatchman, to survive the five overs before bad light interfered. If there is legislation to make up lost time by an early start, why cannot the early start be utilised in the first place? Sri Lanka, 93 behind on first innings, have so dominated proceedings since the first session on Monday that they were able to extend their second innings to 130 overs, during which time they reached 442 for eight with the truly remarkable Kumar Sangakkara batting remorselessly for 152, his first hundred against England. It was also the fourth successive Test match in which he has passed 150 in one innings or the other, another world record in a match that has already yielded several. If Sangakkara was a brilliant player before he abandoned the wicketkeeping gloves at the end of the tour of England last year, then there is no more formidable player in the world at the moment. Fourteen innings in that period have now produced 1,529 runs at an average of 152.9, including seven hundreds, three of them doubles and one as near as dammit. If during a stay of getting on for seven hours he scarcely put a foot wrong, driving supremely and accumulating methodically off his legs, then for one so accomplished there was still the oddity of his frenetic passage to three figures. Perhaps, having tossed his wicket away for the cause in the first innings when eight short of his hundred, he wanted this one more intensely than ever. Maybe after spending so long against the old ball, the new one, just taken, was ruffling his demeanour. If the back-foot punch off Anderson that took him to 95 was as elegant as any of the 19 boundaries he was to hit before he clipped a low catch to shortish midwicket to give Paul Collingwood a rare Test wicket, then the vast waft that followed in the same over, when 97, smacked of nerves. Further evidence came in the next over from Ryan Sidebottom, when he hung his bat out tamely and edged a straightforward catch to Ian Bell, who put it down at first slip. Finally, he resorted to drilling Anderson in the air and over extra cover to complete his sixteenth Test hundred before settling down once more. After playing some excellent combative cricket at times during the first three days, England unravelled yesterday, with some shoddy ground fielding, a missed stumping by Matt Prior that would have completed a pair for Jehan Mubarak and the sort of misfields that epitomise a malaise. In fairness to Prior, he has otherwise kept wicket competently, with an excellent leg-side catch yesterday standing up to Hoggard to see the back of Jayawardene for 65, a bonus wicket after a third-wicket stand with Sangakkara of 122. In such circumstances, when a game appears to be slipping away and damage limitation starts to seem like the only option, bowlers need all the backing they can get from the field but the intensity was not maintained. The bowlers need to play their part, too, and at times the discipline evaporated. Anderson in particular had been singled out for special treatment by Sanath Jayasuriya on Monday and yesterday was chastised mercilessly as he strove to keep the ball up and find reverse swing that failed to materialise - 128 runs conceded at almost a run a ball was his reward and probably he will not make the second Test. Vaughan lost a reliable ally in Hoggard, who has been grimacing with his back for much of the game. He gave it a go yesterday but was forced to retire to the dressing room. The next Test starts in Colombo on Sunday and his fitness is in doubt. It left a responsibility on Monty Panesar, who toiled through 45 overs in all, managed the occasional danger ball which spat out of the rough, but generally was kept at arm's length by Sangakkara and Jaywardene. He appears to be having trouble deciding on an optimum pace for these pitches. Such is their sluggishness that his habitual pace would seem to be necessary and certainly bowling slower makes the short ball sit up and beg. But once the hardness goes from the ball there is little bounce to threaten gloves or the bat's shoulder. The balance between attack and defence is another issue, but with men sitting back just five maiden overs out of 45 is not adequate, especially when the only reward was two late wickets. If Panesar feels too strongly the level of expectation on these surfaces, then the great bowlers will say that attrition and a relaxed approach works fine. The ball will do all it needs to. Muttiah Muralitharan is not of this world but just watch him second time around today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
