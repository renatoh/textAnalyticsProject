The manager praised an all\u2011round team performance in which Scott McTominay played much of the first half without one of his contact lenses, Axel Tuanzebe defended admirably after 10 months out, and Bruno Fernandes scored when retaking a penalty, after his first attempt was saved. Solskj\u00e6r said of United\u2019s stand-in captain: \u201cI\u2019m not surprised \u2013 you know he has great character and after the Newcastle one [he missed on Saturday] and this I was sure he would want to take it again.\u201d Fernandes\u2019s opener came on 23 minutes and while Anthony Martial\u2019s second-half own goal levelled the Group H match, Rashford\u2019s strike in the 83rd minute clinched victory having scored the penalty that knocked PSG out of the last 16 when the sides last met at Parc des Princes in 2019. Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cWe won against one of the best teams in the world \u2013 a fantastic one. Victor [Lindelof] and Axel played tremendous. It\u2019s a better performance this time than last even though last time we won 3-1. The performance showed we had developed. Scott [McTominay] and Fred were outstanding. Scotty played the first half with only one eye \u2013 that was the most impressive thing because he lost his contact lens.\u201d Of Rashford\u2019s composure to score the winner Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cHe\u2019s got quality and took his goal very well, a great turn and a good finish in the corner.\u201d The victory follows the 4-1 win at Newcastle on Saturday, meaning United have responded to the 6-1 humiliation by Tottenham with two impressive performances. Solskj\u00e6r is now looking forward to Chelsea\u2019s visit on Saturday. \u201cWhen you win games and perform well you get confidence. We\u2019re going to go into that game confident. I\u2019m looking forward to the next few months.\u201d The win came without the injured Harry Maguire and Mason Greenwood and with Paul Pogba demoted to the bench. \u201cWe have shown we have a good squad,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
