The England management were already in a race against time to get their bowlers fit. But now the situation is even more urgent after the ICC confirmed that only members of England's official 15-man party could take part in the warm-up matches. England play Canada on 16 February and Pakistan on 18 February \u2013 both in Dhaka \u2013 as they set about trying to win cricket's major one-day trophy for the first time. But they have only one fit fast bowler in Jimmy Anderson. Scans showed that Ajmal Shahzad was suffering from a \"minor hamstring tear\" while Chris Tremlett has a \"minor side strain\". Neither fast bowler is expected to take part in the final two matches of the one-day international series in Australia. Shahzad is a member of England's World Cup 15, though he is not expected to make the team if everyone is fully fit. Tremlett, though not a member of the squad, is considered to be first reserve and therefore has one foot already on the plane to the subcontinent. England's latest injuries would be of little consequence were it not that three players who are expected to make the final XI, Tim Bresnan (calf), Stuart Broad (abdominal injury) and Graeme Swann (knee and back), are also battling to get on the plane which will arrive in Dhaka on 13 February. England can replace injured players but once they have been replaced \u2013 before 16 February \u2013 they will not be allowed back into the tournament. The situation could provide an unexpected opportunity for the Warwickshire all-rounder Chris Woakes. For, even if England are willing to go into the tournament with Bresnan, Broad and Swann just back from rehab, they will be unlikely to want another crock \u2013 Shahzad \u2013 on the subs' bench. There is only one fast bowler, Surrey's Jade Dernbach, a member of England's 30-strong World Cup party, who has not been involved in the current ODI series. Another, Liam Plunkett, will join the rest of the squad in Perth on Thursday. Plunkett has taken four flights to get here from the Caribbean, a journey of more than 12,000 miles. This would suggest that England do not trust Luke Wright, who is in the World Cup party, to be one of the main seamers in the final match in Perth. The coach Andy Flower is unlikely to be mistaken for Sky Masterson but, if he is not one of nature's gamblers, he will hardly go into the World Cup with bowlers whose fitness worries are at the front of his mind. Wright, who is somewhat fortunate to make the cut, could be another beneficiary of the crisis. \"I think I'm more of a batting all-rounder,\" he said. \"They definitely see someone who can do as Colly's [Paul Collingwood] done. Colly's come in for the last one-dayers and bowled really well. If they need that extra bowler, I'm the option. And in India as a hard-hitting batsman on those sort of wickets. \"I think my ability to hit the ball in the power-play is one of the things that helped me get to the World Cup on those low, slow pitches.\" The cup holders, Australia, also have problems. Callum Ferguson has been added to the squad for the remaining two one-dayers after the withdrawal of Shaun Marsh with a hamstring injury. Ricky Ponting, however, had a testing net behind closed doors and the captain looks on course for the World Cup after missing the ODIs with a broken finger."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
