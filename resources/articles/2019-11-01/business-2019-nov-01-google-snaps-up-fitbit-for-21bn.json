Google is paying cash for the San Francisco-based Fitbit, which was set up in 2007. It is paying $7.35 per share \u2013 a premium of more than 70% to the Fitbit share price before the shares were suspended earlier this week amid takeover speculation. The price, however, is a fraction of the company\u2019s value when it floated in 2015. The shares were initially priced at $20, and soared to more than $50 in the weeks following the initial public offer. But it has suffered in recent years from competition from bigger rivals Apple, Samsung and China\u2019s Xiaomi. In August the group\u2019s shares hit a low of $2.85. The deal, which is Google\u2019s biggest consumer purchase since it bought home-tech business Nest five years ago for $3bn, will have to be approved by shareholders and regulators, especially over how it handles Fitbit users\u2019 data. The firm claims to have 28m active users worldwide and its fitness trackers store location and physical health data for users who monitor their activity, sleep and and exercise using a range of wearable devices. Fitbit said it would not sell customers\u2019 personal data and pledged that wellness data would not be used by Google ads. Google has offered its own fitness tracking service, called Google Fit, since 2014, but has relied on third parties such as Fossil and Tag Heuer to produce Android-compatible smartwatches. In a blogpost announcing the deal Rick Osterloh, Google\u2019s senior vice president in charge of devices &amp; services, said Fitbit had been a pioneer but that Google could \u201chelp spur innovation in wearables and build products to benefit even more people around the world.\u201d The market for wearables is growing rapidly. Last week, in its latest quarterly financial results, Apple reported annual sales growth of more than 50% in its \u201cwearables\u201d division, which includes watches. The iPhone-maker\u2019s total sales from wearables over the three month period were \u00a36.5bn. The deal will expand Google\u2019s range of consumer products, which already includes smartphones, headphones, smart speakers and laptops. Osterloh wrote that Google would not misuse Fitbit users\u2019 personal data: \u201cWe will never sell personal information to anyone. Fitbit health and wellness data will not be used for Google ads. And we will give Fitbit users the choice to review, move, or delete their data.\u201d Earlier this week, amid reports that the deal was being finalised, the British Labour party wrote to the UK\u2019s competition regulator calling for the takeover to be blocked. Tom Watson, the shadow digital, culture, media and sport secretary, called the deal a \u201cdata grab\u201d. He said: \u201cIf this acquisition were to proceed, Google could have information on how we sleep, when we move, what we eat, on our breathing and our heartbeats. This data could hardly be more sensitive, but \u2026 all this information could then be used [for] micro-targeting, advertising, and behaviour modification. The risk to consumers here is significant.\u201d Watson has also written to the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, expressing concern over the data aspects of the merger and asking her office to assess whether it raises privacy concerns. Fitbit insisted its users\u2019 data would be safe in the hands of its new owner. In a statement it said: \u201cConsumer trust is paramount to Fitbit. Strong privacy and security guidelines have been part of Fitbit\u2019s DNA since day one, and this will not change. Fitbit will continue to put users in control of their data and will remain transparent about the data it collects and why.\u201d The deal is expected to be completed in 2020, but still needs approval from shareholders and regulators. Fitbit co-founder and CEO, James Park, said: \u201cGoogle is an ideal partner to advance our mission. With Google\u2019s resources and global platform, Fitbit will be able to accelerate innovation in the wearables category, scale faster, and make health even more accessible to everyone. I could not be more excited for what lies ahead.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
