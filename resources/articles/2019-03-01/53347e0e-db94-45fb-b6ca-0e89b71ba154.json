Through mid-afternoon the grey stone squares of Munich\u2019s old town had echoed with choruses of \u201cAllez, Allez, Allez\u201d, Liverpool\u2019s own European anthem of the past two years. It is a sound that may just come to haunt this ageing Bayern era, which reached its own decisive goodbye on a chilly, luminous night at the Allianz Arena. Quietly, and always with a feeling of strength in reserve, Liverpool produced a performance shot through with the steel of the mature Klopp period. A 3-1 win in this last\u201116 second leg will live with the best of the club\u2019s modern era. This is a Bayern squad reaching the end of something. But before this game they had lost only once in 26 home Champions League fixtures. On this same ground Bayern had overrun the best club side of the past 20 years, the tail-end of the Xavi era at Barcelona. Real Madrid have been cuffed aside, Juventus digested, Arsenal tossed around the pitch like a team of Lego men. In the face of this Liverpool were fearless. Trent Alexander-Arnold was brilliant, shutting down the venerable Franck Rib\u00e9ry and losing nothing by comparison with David Alaba as a fluid, playmaking full\u2011back. Above all this was a cold, almost dismissive performance, led by the absurdly composed Virgil van Dijk. It has been said before. It needs to be said a little louder, and with added italics and underline. Van Dijk has been a remarkable signing, a player who has managed to change every part of the team around him, to provide a whole other gear on his own. Liverpool could not have produced this performance in their fun, skittish run to the final last season. They won here by refusing to back down, refusing to give space, and by ruthless finishing when the moment presented itself. J\u00fcrgen Klopp had promised that Liverpool would play \u201cbrave\u201d football, meeting Bayern\u2019s customary swagger with some of their own. Klopp knows how it feels on nights like these in this luminous giant doughnut of a stadium, a challenge of will as much as anything else. Liverpool did rise to meet the occasion. But then they had their spine, guts, backbone and all-round 6ft 4in Dutch factotum back in the team. There were four Van Dijk tackles, five clearances and three headers won. There was a lofted pass to create the opening goal and the timing and skill to head the second direct from James Milner\u2019s corner, a decisive blow from a sustained, slow-burn spell of pressure. Mainly he just stood there being Virgil, appearing at times like the only grown-up on the set. Van Dijk is a fascinating leader. He doesn\u2019t yodel and bang his chest. It is more a question of presence, a way of standing. Even watching from the seats you feel somehow that you\u2019re going to find that train home, that the half-time queues will be short, that whatever it is that\u2019s happening in parliament will work out. In front of Van Dijk Liverpool had leader No 2 in Sadio Man\u00e9, who was in waspish, relentless form and who scored Liverpool\u2019s first and third goals. But then Man\u00e9 has been doing this for three months now. The goals here were his 10th and 11th since Christmas, a man playing up to the occasion, decisive where others might have faltered a little. And Bayern in the Allianz Arena is one of the Vegas nights of European football. This is a wonderful stadium, with a roof that curves in at the top like an alpine shelf, retaining the great surging waves of noise from one Bayern end to the other. Under those brilliant white lights Klopp went with his most muscular central trio, the Milner\u2011Henderson\u2011Wijnaldum axis, a midfield that might lack creativity but which could double up at the weekends as a sensationally energetic and committed team of mobile piano lifters. Henderson departed early with an ankle injury. He was replaced by Fabinho who stepped in without missing a beat. Steadily the game settled and thickened. For long periods the players sprinted backward more often than forward, filling the holes, tessellating like grey and red walls meeting over a disputed boundary. Out of nowhere Liverpool scored. It was a lovely piece of creative opportunism. Van Dijk floated the ball forward. Manuel Neuer came haring out, pointlessly, sprawled at Man\u00e9\u2019s feet, and watched as he wriggled away and dinked the most wonderful finish into the corner. Cue silence around the Allianz Arena, save for the sustained white noise from the Liverpool fans up in the gods. Klopp leapt and pranced, all teeth and wild goggling eyes. Bayern\u2019s equaliser was a slightly soft Jo\u00ebl Matip own goal. Still Liverpool continued along their way. Mo Salah grew into the game and provided a lovely pass for Man\u00e9\u2019s second goal deep into the second half as Bayern withered. At the end of which the season remains wide open on two fronts. Liverpool will take huge heart from a performance of high-spec, cold-blooded control. For Bayern, and the great team of the past six years, this was goodnight, but also a wider kind of goodbye."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
