The Australian Rugby Union are ready to sign the host-union agreement but their counterparts in New Zealand are still stalling four months after the draw was scheduled to be held. It is now likely to be in February. New Zealand is due to stage two of the four pools, two quarter-finals and a semi- final but is worried that it will make a substantial loss because its only source of revenue from the competition is gate receipts and Australia is likely to host the two biggest draws, England and South Africa, in the group stage. RWC is looking at ways of subsidising the NZRU and is acting as arbiter as relations between the host unions have become unusually fraught. The problems RWC has had this year could have an impact next April when a vote is taken on who should stage the 2007 event. England and France are the contenders but the English are preparing a stand-alone bid whereas the French plan to involve their Six Nations colleagues, as Wales did in 1999. Wales currently have problems of their own as the six leading clubs, Swansea, Cardiff, Newport, Llanelli, Bridgend and Pontypridd, are threatening to stop their players taking part in next year's Six Nations Championship unless the Welsh Rugby Union agrees to their plans for restructuring the professional club game. The clubs, who all failed to make the semi-finals of the Celtic League, want the WRU to reduce the number of clubs who compete in the Welsh-Scottish and Celtic leagues from nine to six, which would mean ditching Neath, Ebbw Vale and Caerphilly. The six have formed a cartel and hold the contracts of their players who, Iestyn Harris apart, have not signed deals with the WRU. Wales have slipped to eighth in the world rankings after their defeats by Ireland and Argentina. New Zealand have replaced Australia at the top, with England in second place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
