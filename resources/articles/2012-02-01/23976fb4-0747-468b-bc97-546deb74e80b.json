Their male counterparts Ed Clancy, Geraint Thomas, Steven Burke and Peter Kennaugh received a similarly raucous and inspiring welcome and both teams made it to their respective gold and silver medal ride-offs, putting two medals in the bag for Great Britain. The women race against Canada [Friday] on Fridaybut some bizarre scheduling means that the men face a three-day wait until Sunday's final against Australia. The women's trio took to the track 90 minutes into the session and lived up to expectations that they will be one of the safest Great Britain bets for an Olympic medal, qualifying a close second to Canada. Their time, 3min 21.370sec compared with 3min 20.785 for the Canadian trio but what mattered was the finishing position, which guaranteed a place in the ride-off for gold and silver. The cheers and applause seemed to follow the three women down each straight and through each of the bankings as they rode their qualifying round. \"We always planned to go out fast. We just couldn't keep it going but hopefully tomorrow we will,\" said Rowsell, who feels the world record could well fall here. \"The noise is amazing. When you're racing you try to block everything out but you can't block that amount of noise out.\" According to their coach, Paul Manning, the warmth of the crowd may have got to the three women, who set off ahead of schedule and faded in the final kilometre, admittedly a pattern followed by several of the opposition. \"It's good to be in the final but we will need a better performance. I think the crowd got behind them and they were a bit excited. I had to rein them in a little bit.\" Clancy said that he and his fellows had watched Trott, Rowsell and Houvenaghel in action and had opted for a conservative start, deliberately not forcing the pace for the first two laps. Restraint was quite an achievement after a buildup that included a sonorous recording of Big Ben tolling and an introduction to the crowd that owed more to boxing than cycling. \"That was just a wall of noise for the whole 16 laps,\" he said. \"It didn't die down one bit. For qualifying that is a bizarre atmosphere. I can't believe 6,000 people have come to see us qualify. It was mental, it really was. All you could hear was noise.\" He was a little disappointed with their time, 3:58.446, but, as their coach Dan Hunt said, they are within reach of the world champions and World Cup leaders Australia. The Olympic Park looks still to be firmly in the hands of the builders, with a maze of barriers between the Stratford entrance and the velodrome, but if the area around the aquatic centre and the main stadium still has the feel of a work in progress, the interior of the \"Pringle\" leaves little to be desired. Those with an interest in the nation's eating habits, incidentally, should note that in spite of the nickname, a different brand of crisps is on sale inside: the now ubiquitous Tyrrells from Herefordshire. Although the Laoshan track in Beijing boasted the most spectacular of ceilings, the London velodrome feels bigger and more imposing than anything Europe has to offer. It outdoes the venerable bowl in Manchester as its seats extend high up into a double tier \u2013 for which the architects are to be congratulated on managing unimpeded sightlines \u2013 and right round the bankings. When the bunched racing begins on Friday, it should become an exhilarating and occasionally intimidating venue in which to compete. On Friday its speed potential was demonstrated early on, with only the fifth team out, Canada, getting to a second outside the world record in spite of atmospheric conditions, which were not ideal thanks to high air pressure. On Friday Sir Chris Hoy and Ross Edgar join the new world sprint champion, Jason Kenny, in the team sprint and Victoria Pendleton and Jess Varnish compete in the women's event. Dani King rides the women's scratch race, assuming she is not needed to step into the pursuit trio, and Ben Swift begins his omnium campaign."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
