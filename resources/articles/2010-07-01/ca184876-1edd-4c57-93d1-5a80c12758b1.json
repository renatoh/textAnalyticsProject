Who knows: maybe it really happened. The trouble with Nolan's film is that it pulls so many tricks and double bluffs that it is often hard to get your bearings. And so, like the movie's characters, we are left to blunder blindly down the rabbit hole, labouring to tell the ceiling from the floor and wondering desperately, in the words of one protagonist, \"just whose subconscious we're in now, exactly\". Happily, in the case of Inception, getting lost is half the fun. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Cobb, a haunted corporate \"extractor\" who accepts a mission to plant an idea in the head of billionaire industrialist Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy). So far, so perplexing, except that Nolan is only getting started. On gaining access, the gang discovers that Fischer's subconscious has been \"militarised\" and is now primed to defend itself. Worse, the gang's assignment is constantly threatened by the appearance of Mal (Marion Cotillard), a ghost from Cobb's past who is here re-imagined as a knife-wielding angel of vengeance. Before long, Ellen Page's bright young helpmate twigs what's happening. \"The deeper we go into Fischer,\" she explains to Cobb, \"we also go deeper into you.\" But what an electrifying trip this turns out to be. Full credit to Nolan for at least laying out some ground rules before he yanks away the props. Inception unfolds as a kind of metaphysical heist movie: a Thomas Crown Affair of the senses. It takes its various dream states and arranges them like Chinese boxes, one within the other and each running to a different clock, like Narnia. In dreamland, it transpires, five minutes last an hour and a kingdom can be won or lost in the time it takes for a van to flip off the road. But the momentum of the van still finds a way to percolate down through the levels. In one bravura set piece, the guests at a sterile business hotel are forced to brace their legs against the wall as the whole building lists lazily to one side. Over recent years, Christopher Nolan has made his millions at the helm of the Batman franchise. But Inception marks a return to the audacious concepts and narrative trickery of his 2000 breakthrough, Memento. It is that rarest of beasts: a slippery, cerebral summer blockbuster that slaloms from illusion to reality and back again and leaves its viewer bewitched, bothered and bewildered. Possibly Nolan's film is finally too slick and quick for its own good. Perhaps it is fated to lose a little impact and logic when scrutinised later, in the cold light of day. But let's not quibble. The acid test is whether it works in the moment, in the dark, in the shared dream at the local multiplex. Inception does - with bells on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
