When I was cooking in a private house in the early Eighties he was a regular guest and he always thanked me. I cooked meat for him but I only found out he was a vegetarian afterwards when I read his diaries. I think his vegetarianism was motivated by a love of animals more than a dislike of the taste of meat. The secret to a perfect roast chicken is to cook it well and slowly. I don't believe in colouring it before it goes in the oven, and I never turn it upside down during cooking, because that will flatten the breast, and also cook it quicker. Apart from that, you should put a bit of liquid underneath and use a lot of butter. Gastropub is not a great word. I was very surprised when my book Roast Chicken and Other Stories was named the best cookbook of all time. It's embarrassing to have beaten someone like Elizabeth David. If I 'd been asked to name my favourite it would have been The French Menu Cookbook by Richard Olney. A lot of cookery writers claim that as long as you have good ingredients you can't go wrong. It 's not true. If you're not a good cook you still won't become one however good the ingredients. I would rather have someone who knows how to cook very well using a supermarket broiler chicken than someone who isn't very good cooking a poulet de Bresse. Sometimes I regret I didn't go to college, because I might have met a nice boy there. It took me a long time to come out. People have a problem with tripe and they shouldn't. It's my favourite thing. It's very comforting, very rich. I used to say that if a recipe book had just one or two good recipes it was worth buying, but I 'm not so sure any more. There are just too many recipe books these days. People don't know how to plate food any more. Everything has to be in soup plates, but the knife and fork always fall in. Soup plates are for soup. Risotto should be served on flat plates, and ice cream comes in bowls. The best steak and kidney pudding I have ever eaten was cooked for me by Delia Smith. She is a very good communicator and a very, very good cookery writer and cook. I've always adored great handwriting. When I was running the kitchen at Bibendum I employed two cooks specifically because of the quality of their handwriting. A good risotto should still be moving when it's put on the table, like a lava flow. There's only one thing I won 't eat and that's natto, Japanese fermented soy beans. They are slimy and have the slight pungency of sick. I hate the word 'crispy'. There is never an occasion when 'crisp'needs to become 'crispy '. I think it became popular because of the invention of crispy bacon crisps. It didn't sound right as crisp bacon crisps so they added the 'y '. Elizabeth David had a rant about it once. I'd rather call myself a cook than a chef. All the word means is that you are the head of something. In France you would call the chief of a fire station a chef. I'm not as good with people as I used to be. I've gone to a party in a taxi and turned around halfway there. There is still no seriousness about food in Britain. A desirable restaurant should be full of serious people. I don't mean people who aren't having a nice time, but who are giving the food the attention it deserves. I know it 's very fashionable but I still don't believe fish goes with vanilla. It 's too embedded in creme brulee to go with fish. Would I want to find scampi at the bottom of my creme brulee? Absolutely not. I love cooking in other people 's kitchens more than my own. Perhaps it's because you are performing more, and less responsible for what happens."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
