Which is forgivable, considering it's a talking yellow cart,\" reports The New York Times [free reg req'd]. \"Mounted in the rear of the cart, which narrows like a motorcycle sidecar, is a Global Positioning System unit and a computer database of audio clips about 105 San Francisco sights and features. When the GPS system senses that the cart is passing one of the points in the database, the stereo plays a story or gives clear, occasionally imploring directions.\" The article says the the founders of GoCar Rentals are \"Nathan Withrington, 31, a former technology recruiter from England, and his business partner, Alastair Clements, 34, a former investment analyst from Scotland.\" The carts are imported from The Netherlands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
