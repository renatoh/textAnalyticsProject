Douglas Bay Capital (DBay), an Isle of Man-based investor, together with the lorry driver\u2019s son William Stobart, will take control of Eddie Stobart\u2019s green and red lorries and other assets. The \u00a375m bailout should prevent the company from going bankrupt before Christmas, and allow it to repay some of its \u00a3200m debt. In a statement to the stock market, Eddie Stobart Logistics said shareholders had voted \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d in favour on Friday. Figures showed 81% of voting shareholders approved the deal, which is expected to close as soon as Monday. S\u00e9bastien Desreumaux, Eddie Stobart\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe proposed transaction provides Eddie Stobart with the opportunity to move forward and look to deliver sustainable growth and profitability from a stable footing. Our main priority and focus is now continuing to deliver the high levels of services expected by our customers as we move into the busy Christmas period.\u201d Stobart\u2019s customers include Tesco, Coca-Cola and Amazon. The deal represents a victory for William Stobart over his ex-brother-in-law and the company\u2019s former chief executive, Andrew Tinkler, who had mounted a rival \u00a380m bid to take over Eddie Stobart with the backing of unnamed investors. The childhood friends have taken turns to run the company at various points in its recent history. Tinkler was present at a short shareholder meeting on Friday morning in London. He spoke briefly against the DBay bid, asking the haulage company\u2019s chairman, Philip Swatman, if he had fully explored every option. Sources in the public company\u2019s meeting \u2013 from which journalists were barred \u2013 said his tone was calm. \u201cThe Eddie Stobart business has been a great source of personal pride for me ever since I was first employed to wash and maintain the trucks in the early 1980s, through to being CEO from 2004 to 2014,\u201d Tinkler said. \u201cI hope the company can return to its former glory and the board continue to work in the interests of all stakeholders to help this iconic business thrive again.\u201d The vote offers a short-term reprieve for Eddie Stobart\u2019s 6,500 workers, who had faced the prospect of a collapse into administration shortly before Christmas. The company, which has a fan club and a dedicated Channel 5 TV series, is months shy of its 50th anniversary. Unions said they were seeking urgent discussions over the future of the workforce, although a person familiar with DBay\u2019s intentions insisted it had no plans for job cuts. Adrian Jones, a national officer for road transport at Unite, said the workers represented by the union were very anxious about their employment. \u201cThe new owners need to be fully aware that Unite will not allow profits to be ramped up at the expense of our members\u2019 jobs, pay or conditions,\u201d he said. In a statement, DBay said: \u201cEddie Stobart\u2019s loyal staff are the best in the industry and we are pleased to be able to provide certainty over their jobs throughout the Christmas period and beyond.\u201d However, DBay faces a battle to secure Eddie Stobart\u2019s long-term future. The Warrington-based company recorded a loss of at least \u00a312m in the first half of the financial year, although accounting problems revealed in August mean it could be much worse. DBay\u2019s return to control, via an unorthodox 51% stake in Eddie Stobart\u2019s operating subsidiary, comes less than three years after it made \u00a3150m from a flotation that valued the haulage company at \u00a3573m. The company\u2019s value had fallen to less than \u00a3270m by August, when shares were suspended. DBay has since bought shares previously owned by Neil Woodford for 6p each \u2013 implying a market value of just over \u00a320m. Eddie Stobart\u2019s board had insisted DBay\u2019s offer was the only one that would prevent its banks \u2013 AIB, BNP Paribas, Bank of Ireland and KBC \u2013 from foreclosing on loans. The board had claimed this would have pushed the company into administration almost immediately. Quicker-than-expected approval for the deal from the City regulator means DBay will shortly start receiving interest at an annual rate of 18% on \u00a355m in loans to the company. There will also be another \u00a320m of available credit from the banks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
