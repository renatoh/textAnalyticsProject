How on earth have Kent managed to storm into the lead in the 4x100m relay? Were there some irregularities in the baton handover? \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any red flags go up yet,\u201d the commentator says, sceptically. For anyone watching 10 years later, the answer is obvious: the replay shows the first Kent runner handing the baton to a 13-year-old Dina Asher-Smith. The footage, uploaded to YouTube by her mother Julie, is probably Asher-Smith\u2019s first TV appearance. She hares down the back straight and gives the baton to her teammate Sophie Ayre, who rounds the final bend in first place. \u201cWe immediately had her on second leg as it\u2019s the longest,\u201d Ayre said. \u201cShe was so easy to work with in a team and we all had fun practising. I was on third leg so she passed me the baton and we always had a really good change.\u201d The 23-year-old ran the same leg for Great Britain\u2019s 4x100m team at the IAAF world championships in Doha on Saturday. They held off the USA to finish second: a silver medal to add to her 200m gold and 100m silver, both new British records, and all accomplished with her trademark beaming smile. World domination beckons. Asher-Smith has a 2:1 in history from King\u2019s College London. Vogue and Elle have feted her, as have Stormzy and Dave, the rapper who won the Mercury prize last month. Last year she and her fellow gold medallist Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who won the heptathlon on Friday, modelled on the catwalk at Paris fashion week. The two women may just be the stars that British athletics needs to nudge people back on to the track. While football, cricket and swimming have all seen falling levels of participation at grassroots, running had seemed to be the one sport that was bucking the trend, with nearly 7 million people running regularly. The growth of parkrun and health drives through programmes such as Couch to 5k have led to more street runners, particularly women. Yet the number of people doing regular track and field events such as sprinting, high jump and javelin has been falling. In November 2016 Sport England\u2019s Active Lives Survey recorded 249,000 people taking part regularly in track and field activities. By November 2018 that figure had fallen to 197,000. Asher-Smith is now focusing on an Olympic gold medal \u2013 or two, maybe even three \u2013 in Tokyo next year and Ayre can imagine how her competitors feel. In the junior girls\u2019 category she ran for Medway and Maidstone, rivals to Asher-Smith\u2019s club, Blackheath and Bromley Harriers, and she got used to watching the younger girl\u2019s back disappear into the distance. \u201cWhenever anyone saw they were in a heat with Dina they knew it was bad news,\u201d Ayre told the Observer. \u201cShe has always been amazing and I know my dad had said from the get-go she\u2019s going to be incredible. \u201cShe was always so modest and one of the nicest people I ever met on the track.\u201d Modest, humble, kind, enthusiastic and bright are words that crop up time and again when people describe Asher-Smith, from coaches and teachers to classmates and competitors. Dina \u2013 short for Geraldina \u2013 was born and grew up in Orpington, one of those suburbs on the fringes of south-east London where there seems to be a park around every corner. Her family home is in one of the many streets around Poverest Park, which backs on to Perry Hall primary school, the two places that cemented Asher-Smith\u2019s early love of her sport. \u201cShe would have been seven,\u201d said Teri Carty, who ran Perry Hall\u2019s running club every Monday lunchtime. \u201cTo start with I was running with her. And then she would just overtake me. But I did keep plodding through. She would have a big smile on her face as she ran past me again. It wasn\u2019t a belittling smile, it meant \u2018you\u2019ve given me this opportunity and I\u2019m using it\u2019.\u201d High-place finishes at inter-school cross-country competitions swiftly brought her to the attention of Blackheath and Bromley Harriers. \u201cShe did three of those, and I always remember the last one,\u201d Carty said. \u201cShe said: \u2018I\u2019ve had enough of this.\u2019 She was fed up being cold and wet. She always did amazingly well. And that\u2019s when she turned it round and decided she wanted to do shorter distances.\u201d By this time Asher-Smith had started going to Perry Hall\u2019s summer athletics club, doing javelin and sprinting and other track and field sports. \u201cMy lasting memory of her was the way she bounced over some little hurdles that we set up as a warm-up,\u201d said teacher Jonathan Hewitt. \u201cAll the other kids just plodded over them. She was like a gazelle, as though she had springs on her feet.\u201d By the time Asher-Smith went on to secondary school, sprinting had become a serious pursuit and she started to be selected for competitions around the country: county events, then national championships for Kent, then the Commonwealth Youth Games. \u201cI still smile at the fact that her mum was very, very concerned that it might interrupt her learning,\u201d Carty said. \u201cAnd I think that gave Dina that push to think I must show Mum or Dad that I can do both.\u201d She could: at Newstead Wood school \u2013 a selective girls\u2019 grammar in Orpington \u2013 Asher-Smith achieved a remarkable 10 A* GCSEs, then three As at A-level. In 2015, the year after she won the 100m at the World Junior Championships and after a summer in which she had set a British record in the 200m at her first world championships, in Beijing, she began reading history at King\u2019s College London. By the time she graduated with a first, she had an Olympic bronze medal. \u201cTo be able to do what she\u2019s done academically as well as the commitment that she\u2019s had to give to be where she is in sport, you know, that\u2019s amazing,\u201d said Perry Hall\u2019s headteacher, Lorraine Richards. Last year, after a clean sweep at the European championships with golds in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay, Asher-Smith began to show the rest of the world that she is not only an athlete. She appeared on the cover of Elle magazine and featured with several other significant figures in the video for south London rapper Dave\u2019s single Black. She appeared on the Jonathan Ross Show and bantered with Ross and the other guests without a stumble. \u201cYou don\u2019t get invited on chatshows unless you\u2019re good \u2013 you\u2019ve got to be entertaining and you\u2019ve got to be able to tell a story that is going to be amusing,\u201d said Nigel Currie, a sports marketing expert. \u201cAnd she\u2019s got all that.\u201d Currie says Asher-Smith\u2019s choice to become a sprinter is what makes her so marketable. \u201cSprinting is the blue ribbon event. There\u2019s lots of events and lots of opportunities to break world records or be the fastest woman in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s burst on to the scene at exactly the right time, a year before the Olympics. She\u2019s probably got the potential to become the highest-paid female athlete we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Children and staff at Perry Hall school are also looking forward to the Olympics, where there are signs that Asher-Smith really might prompt a boom in track and field participation. Louise Davison, who was in the year above Asher-Smith and ran 800m for Blackheath and Bromley Harriers, is now a teacher at the school and has taken over the running club. \u201cI\u2019ve had 15 children come to me today and say \u2018Can I have a running club letter, can I have a running club letter?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re really enthusiastic about joining, knowing that was where Dina started.\u201d The headteacher agrees. \u201cLast time she came here, she brought her medals,\u201d Richards said. \u201cI think she was really overwhelmed with how excited the children were to see her.\u201d For all her achievements so far, her teachers still recognise the little girl who first started at their school. \u201cShe\u2019s no different,\u201d Carty said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her since she was four-and-a-half. And I see her now on TV and she\u2019s just a taller four-and-a-half- year-old, if that makes sense. She\u2019s not changed at all.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
