The first time he had been faced with Katz's grin he had thought it expressed gaiety, but after long exposure to it he had recognised that what he had considered dimensional was really only painted on with clever fool-the-eye shadows. Now he felt no obligation to return it. \"Have to forgive the appearance, Moonbloom; we're in the midst of our fall house cleaning.\" He waved a trumpet at the littered room, which, as usual, showed signs of recent orgy. From the other room the sound of loud singing cut off suddenly. Norman nodded and sat gingerly on a chair strewn with cracker crumbs. \"I would like to ask a favour of you, Katz.\" \"Name it, Moonbloom, you have but to ask,\" Katz answered, his smile intruding on his speech so his M's were closer to N's. \"Well I've asked you before and I really ...\" \"Moonbloom-moom!\" a skinny, black-haired man shrieked ecstatically from the doorway. He was stark naked except for sunglasses and a towel Arab-fashion over his head. \"Is it Moonbloom of the Broom Street Moonblooms? Or Bloomin' Moonbloom of Coon Lagoon?\" He had a pencil-thin moustache and a long, swanlike neck ... Norman smiled tiredly. \"Hello there, Sidone,\" he said. \"And hello there, Moonbloomin' Moonbloom!\" Everything was delivered with the fervour of a man who laughs harder than anyone else at his own jokes' punch lines. \"How they hangin', Moonbloom? Look at him, Stan, how peaceful he looks, how natural! You would almost expect him to move. Ah, those embalmers, they are experts.\" \"He has a favour to ask, Jer,\" Stan said, slouching in a battered armchair and running his fingers dotingly over his horn, tracing the intaglio cartouches on its body, depressing the valves with feather touches, his smile revealing its structure as a multitude of minute quivers and electrical arcs. \"For the Moonbloom - the moon !\" Sidone declaimed ardently. Norman sighed, waiting for the intensity of idiocy to recede at least enough for him to be faintly heard. The room was messy. There were cigarette ashes still in their original, cylindrical shape and lying in the grooves they had burned on tables and counters. There was a smell of spilled beer and unemptied ash trays ... A plumber's candle stood in a saucer; a woman's stocking hung from a wall fixture; a drumstick rose mastlike from an empty whisky bottle, capped with a prophylactic. Sidone put a cigarette into a long holder and lit it. Norman sat forward. \"Now I know you fellas are musicians and . ...\" \"The secret's out, Stan,\" Sidone said. \"Moonbloom's on to us.\" \"All right,\" Norman said with some impatience. \"I know you have to practise, but you could practise during the earlier evening. Some of the other tenants ...\" \"Say no more, Moonbloom,\" Sidone cried. \"I know your problem. We are annoying people. Well we are annoying people . Stan, you must buy a mute for that horrid horn.\" \"And you, Sidone, must buy a pair of those new sponge-rubber drumsticks,\" Katz replied. \u00b7 Extract from The Tenants of Moonbloom by Edward Lewis Wallant, with an introduction by Dave Eggers, published by New York Review Books at \u00a39.99"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
