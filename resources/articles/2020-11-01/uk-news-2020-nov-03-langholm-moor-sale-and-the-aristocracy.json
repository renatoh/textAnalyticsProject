Surely a more equitable process would be for such lands to be transferred to an appropriately established community trust at no cost, rather than relying on public donations and money from a government-established fund. The present owners and their predecessors will have enjoyed centuries of rents and other benefits deriving from their ownership of the freely bestowed land. When so much of the land in the UK is owned by the aristocracy, such a process would be a much fairer means of achieving land reform than using public money to buy back such land \u2013 and better than tumbrils in Whitehall and a guillotine in Parliament Square, perhaps.
