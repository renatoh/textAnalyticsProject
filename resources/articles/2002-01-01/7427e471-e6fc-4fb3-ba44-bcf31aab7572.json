But then this 19-year-old phenomenon, who happily pleads guilty to several counts of GBH on footballs, still lives at home with mum rather than in a bachelor pad. The strength of his family ties can be measured on match days when his mother, step-father, younger sister, girlfriend and various aunts and uncles witness his every move on the pitch. Defoe was brought up to respect his elders, which is why his normally cheerful features retreat into a scowl when one asks about the prospective departure of West Ham's captain Paolo di Canio to Manchester United. Although Defoe would stand to gain most from the exit of a rival striker, he says: \"Paolo would be a great loss and we would all miss him. \"He is an inspiration to all the youngsters at the club and you can learn a lot just by watching him in training. He gives me advice every day and he has even promised to buy me a watch if I score 11 goals this season.\" With seven league and cup in the bag already that is a shoo-in, though Di Canio may not, after all, have to travel from Manchester to deliver it. While his farewell gesture to fans at Upton Park last weekend indicated it was his last game for the club, United have refused to increase their \u00a32m offer amid rumours that the sticking point is Di Canio's insistence on a share of the transfer money. The Italian's exit would leave Defoe as an automatic first- choice striker alongside Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9. Indeed, Defoe's form suggests he might already have found a ticking present from Di Canio under his Christmas tree had his manager Glenn Roeder been courageous enough to give him a starting role more often. As it is, Defoe has still managed his goals in 20 games, 13 as a substitute, as his manager has handled his precocious talent with kid gloves, often sending him on in the dying embers of matches. Defoe modelled himself on Ian Wright and, after watching endless hours of his hero on video, has developed the same striker's single-mindedness. \"Once I get on that pitch\", he says, \"my only thought is to get into the box and score goals.\" After managing the feat twice in the FA Cup at Macclesfield two weeks ago Defoe arrived home to find an answerphone message from Wright. He chuckles: \"I pulled a good chance for my hat-trick wide and Wrighty left me a message saying I should have chipped the keeper. But he also phoned me a few weeks ago to tell me what a great player I was and that I had a little more in my game than him, which was nice.\" Defoe took the praise in his stride and refused to let his modesty be dented when the England Under-21 manager David Platt described him as \"a player without a weakness\", bracketing him with Michael Owen and Luis Figo. Defoe insists that he is still learning the game, though he does allow himself to fantasise about stepping on the plane to Japan with Sven-Goran Eriksson's England World Cup squad. He says: \"Ever since I first kicked a ball I have dreamed of playing for England and, if I keep scoring goals in the Premiership, who knows? If it happens this summer, it will be a dream come true.\" Eighteen months ago Defoe could not even dream of a first-team place at Upton Park when the then manager Harry Redknapp announced that he was farming him out to Bournemouth. Facing the likes of Wycombe and Wrexham in the Second Division was not enticing to a boy with stardust in his eyes. He says: \"When I went home and told mum that I was going to Bournemouth, she said, 'No, you're not.' I wasn't too pleased because I spent two years at the Lilleshall school of excellence and the idea of going away again seemed a bit much. \"But I remembered Rio Ferdinand telling me, when I first joined West Ham from Charlton, how he had gone on loan to Bournemouth as a kid and how it had helped him. So I gave it a go and I really enjoyed it. It sharpened up my game.\" It did his public profile no harm either when, uniquely, he scored in his first 10 league games as a professional footballer, beginning at Stoke on October 28. \"I wanted to show everyone what I could do but I missed a few chances before scoring with a header. And I was the smallest player on the pitch.\" Fifteen months on he is still only 5ft 7in and weighs 10st 4lb, though no one ever accused George Best of being a lightweight when he played off an identical weight in his heyday. Having ended last season as Bournemouth's top scorer with 18 goals from 29 league games, Defoe was summoned back to Upton Park on a vague promise by Roeder that he might get a chance around the new year. In fact, he came off the bench at Anfield on the second Saturday of the season and has been in the squad ever since. His most famous moment came at Old Trafford on December 8 when he won the game with another header, only to be replaced by a fit- again Kanout\u00e9 in the following match against Arsenal. But it was a gentle letdown by Roeder who, Defoe says, \"told me, 'you're part of us now, you're part of the seniors so just keep it up.' I told him that I was enjoying it.\" If Roeder had harboured any doubts about the youngster's temperament, they were dispelled a few weeks earlier when he returned to Charlton. He says: \"When I was warming up before the start, the crowd were booing and calling me Judas. But I went out again at half-time to warm up with David James and, when I got on, I scored quite a nice goal, which is what I wanted to do really.\" It is all Defoe ever wants to do really. And as Chelsea will discover tomorrow, if they give him a sniff at goal, he does it remarkably well."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
