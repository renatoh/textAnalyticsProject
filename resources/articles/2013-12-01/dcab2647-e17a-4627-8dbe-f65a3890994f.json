He hasn\u2019t scored a single one at club level: not for Heracles, his current club in the Dutch top flight, nor during his time in the first division of Portugal, where he moved as a teenager. It\u2019s worth clearing this up because for many Socceroos supporters Davidson is still that mysterious young player who came off the bench against Scotland last year and then headed one straight past Mark Schwarzer. A torturous inauguration to international football, and he never made it back on to the park under Holger Osieck. (Well, he did come on for the second half of the massacre in Paris, but given it was 4-0 within the first half hour, we can assume Osieck\u2019s contract had already been torn up by the break.) Davidson has been a starting fixture at left-back in both games since, and shortly after play got under way against Costa Rica in Sydney last week it looked to many that he\u2019d beaten his keeper again. Not so. \u201cI didn\u2019t really head it - the striker kicked it into my head, which was a bit unlucky. But thankfully it was stopped on the line.\u201d It would have been particularly unfortunate, as it would have overshadowed a performance by the 22-year-old which won the admiration of new coach Ange Postecoglou and helped soothe the national anxiety about a perceived dearth of Australian left-backs. It was a performance that even included a role in the match-winning goal. \u201cHe played me through. They blocked my cross and it went out,\u201d says Tommy Oar of the one-two leading up to the corner, which Oar took to set up the goal. \u201cIn the last 30 minutes we were dominating the game. He was getting forward and we combined together well.\u201d The pair share a lot of history, having played together for years in the national youth teams, Davidson at left-back, Oar his partner on the left wing. \u201cThere\u2019s some good chemistry there and I think it showed against Costa Rica,\u201d says the defender. \u201cWe read each other well and played well with each other. And Tommy\u2019s got a great engine, so it helps me, defending-wise, that he tracks his man back and he\u2019s not lazy.\u201d Team-mates one week, opponents the next. This weekend, the pair went head to head at club level in the Netherlands\u2019 Eredivisie, with Davidson\u2019s Heracles falling 2-1 at home to Oar\u2019s FC Utrecht. Their last encounter, in May, also went the way of the visitors, and saw Davidson pick up the only red card of his professional career - one he can see a funny side of now. \u201cI got milked by the striker. Tommy told me afterwards that the striker said he dived.\u201d Both clubs are having inconsistent seasons: Heracles have beaten the likes of Feyenoord, but could only get a point against lowly NEC; at Utrecht, it\u2019s been pretty much win-loss-win-loss since the opening round. On individual levels though, things are motoring ahead, with both now regulars in their starting line-ups. And as Postecoglou has made clear, getting regular game time is an invaluable commodity for a young player in a World Cup year \u2013 something that is currently eluding the other budding Socceroos plying their trade in the Eredivisie, Eli Babalj and Oar\u2019s team-mate Adam Sarota, due to injury. \u201cYou can\u2019t just turn the tap on and off,\u201d says Davidson. \u201c(Oar) has stepped up at the international level and (in the Costa Rica match) he did what he did because he\u2019s doing it week in, week out at club level.\u201d Oar agrees: \u201cPlaying well for your club maximises your chances with the national team, so my focus for now is on Utrecht and improving our position in the league.\u201d Both players are big wraps for Postecoglou, and felt right at home with him at the helm. Davidson slotted easily into the new boss\u2019s game plan because, as at club level, he was used as a hard-charging full-back in an 4-3-3 formation. \u201cWith Ange, he likes attacking full-backs, which is good because that suits my game to a tee. \u201cAnd he\u2019s given the youngsters a bit more of a go, and he\u2019s given them a bit more confidence. I think that was the biggest difference for me. With Holger, I think everything was pretty much set in. So with me coming in later, he pretty much already had his players. Whereas with Ange, everybody is on a clean sheet and everyone was trying to impress him and get off to a good start.\u201c For Oar, the good performance in Sydney was a chance to repay the man who gave him his A-League debut and helped him get to Europe a few months later. \u201cHe was a great mentor for me,\u201d he says of his coach at Brisbane Roar. \u201cHe was always very motivating and was always able to get the best out of his players. Why everybody respects him so much as a manager (is because) it\u2019s always a level playing field for everybody. The same approach applies to everybody in the whole team. It\u2019s not one rule for one person and different ones for another. \u201cHe\u2019s a fantastic coach and he can take the Socceroos a long way.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
