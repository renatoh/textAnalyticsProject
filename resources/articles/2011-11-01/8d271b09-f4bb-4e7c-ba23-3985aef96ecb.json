Answer: it means bad news is on the way. Sure enough, the news released by the Office for National Statistics an hour or so after the coffee and croissants in Downing Street on Wednesday was dire. Unemployment rose at its fastest rate for almost 17 years, employment fell even more precipitously and \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 the number of young people out of work rose past the politically-sensitive one million mark. To make matters even worse, the number of people out of work for more than a year hit 868,000, with the long-term jobless rate at 30% for those aged between 16 and 24. The phrase \"lost generation\" is much over-used but seems entirely appropriate on this occasion. And there is worse to come. Sir Mervyn King was in a particularly sombre mood as he announced the details of the Bank of England's quarterly health check on the economy. Threadneedle Street has slashed its growth forecast for the UK to just 1% next year, not nearly strong enough to absorb the people coming into the workforce. What's more, the Bank has a tendency to be over-optimistic about the outlook for activity; just ahead of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, King and his colleagues on the monetary policy committee said they expected the economy to flatline in 2009. The actual outcome was a 5% fall in gross domestic product. The government's response to the jobless figures was predictable: rather than accept any responsibility for the horrific unemployment figures, it blamed the crisis in the eurozone and slower growth in the global economy and proceeded to shed a bucket load of crocodile tears about the plight of the unemployed. But don't be fooled. The explanation provided by the coalition is bogus. It is pure, unadulterated spin, as is the hollow pledge to move heaven and earth to find work for the young unemployed. Why? Because the labour market has been weakening for the past year, because most of the jobs that are being shed are not from the international trade sector of the economy, and because the real reason the economy has barely grown over the past year is due to the sluggishness of domestic demand. Unemployment is what's known as a lagging indicator of economic performance; it takes time for a slowdown in activity to feed through into the jobless figures. Europe's crisis only really moved into its new, dangerous phase in late July and August, and would not have had any impact on Wednesday's employment data, which covers the period from July to September. Indeed, the evidence is that the labour market has been steadily weakening throughout 2011, with a marked deterioration over the past three or four months. A much more plausible explanation for the drop of almost 200,000 in employment in the three months to September is that consumer spending is suffering from the intense squeeze on real incomes caused by high inflation, rocketing fuel bills and January's increase in VAT. Here's the reality. The government inherited an economy where unemployment was coming down. It is now going up. The government inherited an economy where schemes to help young people into work were nibbling away at youth joblessness. It scrapped schemes such as the Future Jobs Fund to save money, making its current hand-wringing particularly inappropriate. When he announced his austerity programme shortly after becoming chancellor, George Osborne insisted that job losses in the public sector would be far outweighed by the opportunities that would be created by a liberated and thriving private sector. Wednesday's figures give the lie to his breezy optimism: 111,000 jobs were shed by the public sector in the three months to June while 41,000 were created in the private sector. And this, note, was the three months to June. It was only subsequently that the big deterioration in the labour market took place. The Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday that average earnings excluding bonuses in the three months to September were 1.7% higher than in the same period of 2010. The annual inflation rate in September 2011 stood at 5.2%, meaning that real incomes are falling rapidly at a time when public spending cuts are starting to bite. Europe's crisis will not help matters; manufacturing exports will be lower, credit conditions tighter and both consumer and business confidence will be shaken. But even if the problems of monetary union were to be solved overnight \u2013 which is unlikely \u2013 the outlook for UK jobs would still be poor. The question, therefore, is what the government intends to do about it. Osborne has insisted that there will be no U-turn on the deficit reduction strategy, and one reason for not doing so is that it would be an admission that Labour's analysis of the economy had been right all along. Which, in truth, it has been. But the breaching of the one million barrier means the chancellor will have to address youth unemployment in his autumn statement at the end of the month. Lower national insurance rates might provide an incentive for employers to hire workers under the age of 25, but only if demand for labour is sufficiently strong. Even with the further dose of quantitative easing strongly hinted at by King on Wednesday, there is no reason to think that it will be."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
