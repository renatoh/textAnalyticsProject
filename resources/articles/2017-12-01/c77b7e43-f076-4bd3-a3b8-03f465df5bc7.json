They will need cojones and more in Sunday\u2019s return at Stade Marcel Michelin, a ground where no English club has won since Sale in 2008. \u201cWe want a group that has balls and I think we have it,\u201dthe Saracens director of rugby said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a club that overreacts but we\u2019re not one that sweeps things under the carpet either. We have an experienced group who have been together for a long time and the relationships that exist within the club are very strong; these are particularly important when you\u2019re going through the kind of period we\u2019re going through.\u201d Saracens do not need to win to retain hope of becoming only the second team to win the European Cup three years in a row, but defeat would push them into third place in the group if Ospreys follow up last weekend\u2019s victory at Northampton, at least six points behind the French champions with two rounds left. Saracens have in recent seasons established themselves as the leading side in Europe, one formidably difficult to beat, even when they do not have their international players available. That makes their run of four successive defeats, six if the Anglo-Welsh Cup is factored in, all the more surprising. If the three league defeats \u2013 the first two of which came during the autumn international period while the third was at Harlequins, where Saracens had lost in the previous two seasons \u2013 were narrow and saw McCall\u2019s side surrender leads in the second half, the 46-14 humbling by a Clermont side who had not won away in the Top 14 was image\u2011shattering. There were mitigating factors, not least the hasty rearrangement after the match was postponed the day before, but they affected both sides. For once, the absence of players such as Billy Vunipola and Maro Itoje was telling, together with the early injury suffered by Brad Barritt, as a team renowned for their defence and unity fell apart with alarming frequency. Saracens pride themselves on honesty and every player has been asked to look at himself and what he could be doing better. \u201cWe asked a lot of questions about our performance and our results lately,\u201d said the centre Marcelo Bosch. \u201cWe had meetings to look at what happened and we know it will be really tough in France because what happened the other day will have given them a lot of confidence. \u201cIt always starts by being honest with yourselves and how you are lacking, for whatever reason. From there, you build and the first training session gave us confidence that we can deliver a performance. We did not start badly against Clermont but we did not take our chances and they scored from their first two. Perhaps recent defeats played on our minds but when you play a team of individuals like that and you are not really on it, you can pay for it. \u201cWe were disappointed in ourselves and, even though it is a tough place to go, we want to put in a big performance and really fight. Games like these feel unique. My age [33] means I am in my last years in my career. The chance to go out and play a game like this one is a gift. \u201cWe\u2019ll try our best. When things don\u2019t go your way, that\u2019s sport, life sometimes. The good thing about this group is that we are honest with ourselves because we care.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
