Paul Scholes was a central figure in the team's plans for so long that even though tonight's match in Copenhagen will be the 12th they have played since he announced his retirement from international football, his absence remains notable. Yet his decision may have been the key that enabled Sven-Goran Eriksson to unlock the final element of the England puzzle. The change was evident yesterday when Eriksson announced the side for the friendly against Denmark. It may not have been a moment of revelation, exactly. Those attending the press conference in a hotel in central Copenhagen did not suddenly experience a collective frisson. But in less than two dozen words Eriksson managed to convey a significant impression of the condition in which they are approaching the last qualifying matches for next summer's World Cup finals. This is what he said. \"Robinson. Gary Neville, Ferdinand, Terry, Ashley Cole. Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Lampard, Joe Cole. Rooney, Defoe. Not bad. It's a good team.\" So what was new about that? Two things. First, the relaxed readiness to divulge the personnel more than 24 hours before the requirement to provide a list for the official team sheet. Second, the fact that the coach was only confirming what everyone in the room already knew. At last England have a team with a completely settled line-up, devoid of controversy. Even the inclusion of Jermain Defoe in place of Michael Owen, who will be suspended for the first of the two imminent qualifying matches, was accepted as nothing more than a logical like-for-like substitution, taken with an eye to the future. So now the controversies have to come from outside sources. From the likes of Robbie Fowler, for instance, discarded long ago and with a ghosted autobiography to sell. Yesterday Eriksson responded to Fowler's stale criticisms by stating that England's door was not closed to the Manchester City forward. \"If I thought he was good enough,\" he said, \"I would pick him.\" Which encapsulated everything that needed to be said. Yet it is another absentee who may have helped Eriksson take the final step towards defining the team that will make its way, all being well, to Germany next June. When Scholes removed himself from the equation in the first week of August last year, a month and a half after the defeat by Portugal in the quarter-final of Euro 2004, he helped the coach to solve his most intractable problem. Until the Manchester United man made his voluntary withdrawal, Eriksson's enduring dilemmas concerned the choice of goalkeeper and, more fundamentally, the configuration of the midfield. How many times did we sit through tortuous analyses devoted to England's perennial lack of a left-sided midfield man? How many thousands of hours were spent trying to devise a scheme to get the midfield quartet of Beckham, Scholes, Gerrard and Lampard into the right shape? Since they were unquestionably the four best midfield players in the country, and since Eriksson was committed to a 4-4-2 formation, the idea of leaving one of them out was unthinkable. But when one of them chose to leave himself out, at the early age of 29 and citing a genuine desire to spend more time with his young family, a solution became clear. Great player though he was and perhaps remains for Manchester United, Scholes was never completely convincing in an England shirt. A player of character and originality as well as great technical skill, he was hard to fit into what is necessarily an all-star line-up, in the sense that the chosen individuals have won their places by virtue of what they already do rather than what they might be asked to do. A three-year scoring drought, ended only against Croatia in his penultimate match last summer, exacerbated the problem. Joe Cole may never be Scholes' equal in certain aspects of his game, but he turns out to be something far more valuable. He is the piece that completes the jigsaw, the one that enabled Eriksson to announce his team with such serenity yesterday. This time last year Cole was still immature in his understanding of the role he could play for club and country, but a season under Jose Mourinho has brought about a transformation. Like Scholes, Cole is essentially out of position on the left of midfield. But Mourinho has taught him how to deploy his talent to the most relevant effect wherever he might be required and now there is not a murmur when his name is inserted into England's line-up. The long-running casting call is at an end. As England's cricket team are demonstrating, the benefits of a settled side cannot be overestimated. It could even be said, as Eriksson approaches his latest date with destiny, that it is now for the opposition to do the worrying. And for this he may be giving thanks to a man who will be putting his children to bed in Saddleworth tonight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
