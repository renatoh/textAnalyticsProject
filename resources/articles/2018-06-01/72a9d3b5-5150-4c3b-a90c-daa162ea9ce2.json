The 18-year-old stole the show in many eyes as he performed Maria Theresia von Paradis\u2019 Sicilienne, Franz Schubert\u2019s Ave Maria and Gabriel Faure\u2019s Apres un Reve, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle signed the register, becoming the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. On Wednesday Kanneh-Mason was celebrated at the Classic Brits, an awards ceremony that returns, its organisers say, \u201creformatted and refreshed\u201d after a five-year hiatus. He won male artist of the year and a critics\u2019 choice award, capping what has been a meteoric rise since he made history in 2016 by becoming the first black musician to win the BBC Young Musician of the Year. Since then the Nottingham teenager has performed at the Baftas and the Proms and released an album, Inspiration, which is still at the top of the classical music charts. The female artist of the year was the American superstar soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming who, over the past year or so, has starred in Carousel on Broadway, Der Rosenkavalier at Covent Garden and the Metropolitan Opera in New York and featured on the soundtrack of films The Shape of Water and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Fleming won from a shortlist that also included Beatrice Rana, Tina Guo, Sheridan Smith and Dame Vera Lynn. Now 101, Lynn was given a lifetime achievement award by the Classic Brit awards. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s humbling to receive accolades and I\u2019m delighted that people still enjoy my music all these years later.\u201d The group of the year award went to Michael Ball and Alfie Boe who also won the album of the year prize, voted on by Classic FM listeners, for their second record, Together Again, a follow up to Together. Other winners at the ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall were Jess Gillam, a 20-year-old saxophonist, who was named the sound of classical 2018; The Greatest Showman for soundtrack of the year; and Tokio Myers, winner of last year\u2019s Britain\u2019s Got Talent, for breakthrough artist of the year. Andrea Bocelli was named a Classic Brits Icon and Andrew Lloyd Webber was given a special recognition award for musical theatre and education. The ceremony will be broadcast on ITV on Sunday 17 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
