Robert Karofsky, who was head of Morgan Stanley's cash equity trading, is joining the rival Deutsche Bank and taking a team of seven with him. Thomas Juterbock, the former head of US government bond trading, also resigned. Morgan Stanley's boss, Philip Purcell, has been under pressure since last month, when eight former executives launched a campaign for his removal. The group initially approached the Morgan Stanley board in private to express concerns about the underperforming share price. They took their campaign public, however, when Mr Purcell shook up the management in March, replacing the president, Stephan Newhouse, with Zoe Cruz and Stephen Crawford. The shake-up led to a stream of departures, including Mr Newhouse's. The firm's top two investment bankers resigned this month, including Joseph Perella, one of Wall Street's best-known figures. The head of equities, John Havens, and Vikram Pandit, who oversaw sales and trading, also left. So far, the Morgan Stanley board has remained firmly behind Mr Purcell. Deutsche Bank said Mr Karofsky would join as managing director, global head of programme trading and direct markets access, as well as America's co-head of cash equities. He had been at Morgan Stanley for 14 years. Morgan Stanley played down the latest losses. \"While disappointed by today's departure of colleagues and friends, we are able to draw off the deep bench of talent to lead the business.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
