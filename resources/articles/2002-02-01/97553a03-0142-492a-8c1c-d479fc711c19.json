Or maybe that should be long white clod if you believe some of the stuff that has been written and said about Stephen Fleming these past few days. New Zealand's increasingly impressive captain has had what they call here a \"shut\" week of it, and you need a Kiwi accent to understand fully that that means it has not been his best. First came the fine, 40% of his match fee no less, courtesy of the match referee Hanumant Singh, for pointing out to the umpires that they were failing to spot that the opposition did not have the minimum number of fielders required within the 30-yard circle. This, ruled Hanumant, constituted dissent. If there were gold medals for nit-picking incompetence then Hanumant, a charming man, would be the Steve Redgrave of the match-refereeing world. He, you might remember, is the fellow who issued a severe reprimand to Mike Atherton for tapping his bat in the crease while doing visualisation routines on the day before the start of the first Test in Galle last year, and pretty much ignored the subsequent neanderthal on-field behaviour of some of the Sri Lanka team. Then, 21 years to the very day after one of cricket's most infamous incidents, when the Australian Trevor Chappell was instructed by his brother Greg to bowl the last ball of a Melbourne one-day final underarm so that Brian McKechnie could not hit a six and win the game for New Zealand, came Fleming's manipulation of the VB Series competition rules to further his team's chances of reaching the finals. In essence, an extra point is allowed in qualifying if the winning side outperform the opposition by 20%. So if chasing they must reach their target in 40 rather than 50 overs; and if bowling last, they must dismiss their opponents or restrict their scoring to 20% fewer than their own total. It was this rule, designed to make one-day cricket more \"exciting\", that Fleming exploited by instructing his batsmen, once the game had clearly been lost, to keep their score below 217 and so donate a bonus point and definite qualification to South Africa, who had made 270. Ultimately it denied Australia, for only the third time, the chance to come to their own end-of-series party - a best-of-three that begins at the MCG tomorrow - because although Steve Waugh's side made 283 and went on to beat the South Africans in the final match on Sunday, they failed to get the bonus point they needed to oust the Kiwis, who progressed on the basis that although they were level on 17 points with Australia, one behind South Africa, they had beaten the Aussies three times out of four in the qualifiers. Payback for Trevor Chappell, one might think. Instead there were cries of foul, not least from some parties in New Zealand who felt that this was demeaning for the country. Waugh himself also whinged like billy-o and said that the system \"had to be looked at\". This, incidentally, is the Steve Waugh who scored an unbeaten 19 from 73 balls as his side, in order to make New Zealand's progress more difficult, staged a tactical go-slow and took 40.4 overs to score 111 to beat West Indies at Old Trafford in the last World Cup. More sinisterly there were suggestions that Lord Condon and his ICC anti-corruption unit would be pricking up their ears, for did this not constitute match-rigging? Out came the ICC code of conduct, with its blathering about captains ensuring that matches are played within the spirit and laws of the game, that players or officials do not contrive or attempt to influence the result of a match, or encourage other players to underperform to effect such contrivance. \"Fleming's gambit carries a life ban\" was the banner at the top of the front page of yesterday's New Zealand Herald. Well that much at least is a nonsense: the result of the match was not affected by Fleming's action (although they finished on 203 for eight, they had been 156 for eight) and unless you want to quibble about the \"spirit\" clause, neither laws nor playing conditions were breached. Indeed the perfectly legitimate way that South Africa, wanting to play New Zealand in the final, had it as their priority on Sunday to ensure Australia failed to win a bonus point rather than go for victory themselves was perhaps a more cynical exercise. You certainly would not want to be a Bombay bookmaker at the moment. Fortunately the ICC and the New Zealand Cricket Board have adopted a sensible approach. \"No action will be taken by us,\" said the Kiwis' chief executive Martin Snedden, who with nice irony was playing in that game 21 years ago. \"None. And ICC are not interested.\" So there, for now, Fleming's tribulations rest, with him unjustly out of pocket and unfairly pilloried but his side blossoming. Hanumant Singh, meanwhile, should not get himself measured for a new match referee's blazer just yet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
