Guthrie said she did not appreciate being called a Murdoch stooge or accused of \u201cGoogle-ising\u201d the ABC just because she had a long career overseas before being appointed to run the public broadcaster. \u201cI do find that when it becomes very personal \u2013 particularly around being called a Murdoch hatchet woman \u2013 [it does hit me],\u201d Guthrie said on ABC News channel\u2019s One Plus One interview program. \u201cI never felt that my role at [Murdoch\u2019s] Star TV was remotely about being a hatchet woman; it was about building an incredible business across Asia. And the idea that I would come to want to join the ABC and have such a privilege of joining the ABC and wanting to disembowel it, it\u2019s beyond ridiculous frankly.\u201d The Australian-born Guthrie spent much of her career abroad after graduating with a law degree, starting at Murdoch\u2019s Sky in 1994 and working at Foxtel before heading up Star TV in Asia. She says that because most people in Australia didn\u2019t know who she was when she replaced Mark Scott last year, there was intense speculation about her motives. \u201cWhen there is a vacuum people read a lot into your CV,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they say \u2018well your longest period of time was at News Corp you must have certain political views\u2019 or \u2018you came from Google so you are going to Google-ise the ABC. And neither of those were true.\u201d Guthrie also revealed she was a very private person and did not enjoy the spotlight of Senate estimates or the media attention the job of running the ABC attracts. She shuns social media, but is on LinkedIn and occasionally Snapchat. After just four days into the job in 2016, she had to appear before Senate estimates, telling senators \u201cI hope you appreciate it\u2019s very early days for me to give you specific details of all my plans\u201d. Her corporate career involved facing up to boardrooms but it had not prepared her for the scrutiny of appearing before Senate estimates and the glare of the cameras, she said. \u201cIn boardrooms you don\u2019t necessarily have masses of photographers and cameras capturing every hair flick or other expression on my face,\u201d she told interviewer Jane Hutcheon. Guthrie said her childhood in Sydney \u2013 as one of four children of a Chinese mother and an Australian father \u2013 was chaotic and untypical. She said she ate fried rice for breakfast and lived with three generations under the one roof. \u201cThere was always food, there was always noise, there was always a TV going.\u201d She described herself as studious but indecisive about a career, shifting from wanting to be a paediatrician to wanting to be a 60 Minutes reporter like her idol Jana Wendt. She praised Four Corners and the recent Lindt Cafe investigation, and rejected criticism that the ABC was spending money on Google advertising. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime to make great programs and not to tell people about it,\u201d she said. Guthrie defended her statement earlier this year that it wasn\u2019t her job to lobby for funding, saying the ABC was in a funding cycle and needed to use the money we have \u201cto the best of our ability\u201d. She hinted that the future might see the ABC gaining more partnerships with outside organisations and shaking up its traditional platforms. \u201cI think of the ABC much more as an ecosystem than a standalone organisation and I do think the future will be much more of a partnership model.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
