Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, the president of the high court's family division, told a committee of MPs that tagging parents who block their estranged partners from seeing their children was a \"step too far\". \"I would be very much opposed to tagging. That's one step too far. I can't see it as appropriate for parents,\" she said. But Dame Elizabeth, the UK's most senior female judge, backed other new measures proposed by ministers to try to ensure that fewer fathers are cut out of their children's lives after divorce. She lauded plans to give judges a wider range of powers to enforce contact orders, including putting parents under curfew, forcing them to do community work or ordering them to attend parenting classes. \"We really do need some tougher powers to encourage parents to behave themselves,\" she told the joint committee on the draft children (contact) and adoption bill. Dame Elizabeth said curfews or community work would be \"a very valuable threat\" to use against uncooperative parents. She suggested escalating the duration of curfews if a parent continued to defy a contact order. For example, a judge could tell the parent \"you can't leave the house between two and four, and if you don't cooperate I'll make it between two and six\". She said that making a parent undertake community work during school hours was preferable to electronically tagging them because their child would not be aware of, and possibly upset by, the punishment. The judge also backed plans to force parents to compensate their estranged partners, for example, if they prevent their children from going on a pre-arranged holiday or outing. One recent case involved a mother who blocked her child from going on a skiing holiday. Such a breach of contact should be treated as contempt of court rather than, as proposed in the draft bill, a civil debt, she said. This was because it could take months to obtain compensation through the civil courts. But Dame Elizabeth warned that the proposed overhaul of family law would only work with significant extra funding and resources. She told MPs that she was \"astonished\" by ministers' assertion that the reform could be cost neutral."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
