It's January 2008 and you receive your first pay slip of the year. Instead of having to hand over hundreds of pounds to your mortgage lender, this month, once you've paid the bills, and perhaps any credit card balance from Christmas, you can keep the lot and will be able to do so every month from now on. It's an appealing prospect and the premise for a new BBC2 show Pay Off your Mortgage in Two Years. But is it possible and does it make financial sense? The answer to both questions is yes, but there are some very big caveats. Let's start with the likelihood of it being a success. In the first programme of the series, a couple took on a mortgage of \u00a385,000 - not a huge sum by today's standards, but probably not untypical. They had been paying it off for three years already and had 22 years left on the term. We were told their total household income added up to \u00a32,681 a month and their total outgoings were the same. This left nothing to put towards making overpayments to clear their loan. Enter \"business guru\" Rene Carayol. He looks at how much they spend and makes suggestions as to how they can save money, including giving up smoking and making packed lunches. As Carayol explains, directing this money towards mortgage repayments could help them cut the overall cost and term of their deal, but while the cumulative effect of small overpayments may surprise you - the total cost of a \u00a385,000 mortgage with a rate of 5% arranged over 25 years can be cut by over \u00a312,000 for an overpayment of just \u00a350 a month - it's actually not that great. In fact, overpayments of around \u00a33,000 a month would be necessary to clear the debt. For a bigger mortgage, read larger overpayments. For a \u00a3150,000 loan on the same terms - not unlikely now the Nationwide building society reckons the average house price across the UK has reached almost \u00a3159,000 - you would need to up your monthly repayments from \u00a3876.89 to \u00a36,376.89. Unless you have a very expensive smoking or lunching habit, cutting costs in these areas is not going to be enough to pay off a typical mortgage over two years. As a starting point, drawing up a budget is a good idea. If you can find out where your money goes each month, you can work out what you can afford to redirect to your mortgage. And knowing that even \u00a350 a month can make a difference in the long run is likely to focus your mind. However, to get a full picture of your finances you should consider any other outstanding debt and any savings you might have. If you have personal loans or credit cards, paying these off will often be a priority over your mortgage because of the amount that is charged in interest. It's unwise to pay extra on a mortgage that probably has a rate of 5.5% or less, when you could easily be paying 9% on a personal loan and 12% on a credit card. If you can pay these off without penalty, it is usually be wise to direct any money you can save towards these before you pay down your mortgage. The same approach should be taken with any money you can bring in by increasing your income. The couple on the show manage to make extra money through \"comedy hypnotism\" and karaoke at old peoples' homes, but that's not everyone's cup of tea. There may be other ways you can boost your earnings - getting rid of unwanted goods via eBay, taking in a lodger, taking on some kind of extra part-time work - and if you're serious about clearing your mortgage by the end of the decade you might need to consider them. Despite their efforts, the couple on the first episode of the show were unable to get halfway towards their goal before the end of the first year, but they had saved enough to make a difference. The \u00a314,000 they had saved fell short of their \u00a342,500 target, but if they use the money to make regular overpayments of \u00a31,167 a month on their mortgage, they may be able to reduce their term to less than five years. If they keep saving this year they may reach their goal, but as the programme shows spending so much time worrying about saving can put a considerable strain on relationships, and sticking to a budget requires discipline and sacrifice. Giving yourself slightly longer to repay your loan could be a better approach if you value your sanity and the occasional night out. As far as the financial sense of repaying your loan early goes, that depends on your circumstances. The most important thing to consider is the early repayment charge - if you lender is going to hit you for repaying your loan in the next two years then it's probably worth waiting. Put the money you save in an account and use it to pay off your debt when the penalty period has ended. If you don't face early repayment charges and you don't have more costly debt to pay off, repaying your mortgage will have a lot of advantages. And it shouldn't stop you getting another home loan in the future, should you want to move or raise money to buy an investment property or make another large purchase."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
