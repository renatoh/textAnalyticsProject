The biennial event, which mainly takes place at Bristol's Watershed Media Centre, is primarily for industry sorts, drawing 500 film-makers from almost 40 countries - it's kind of like a Cannes for camera-wielding pith-helmet wearers. But there's also an impressive programme of more than 60 public screenings - half of which are free. Stand-outs include Paranormal Pigeons (October 21), which explores the mystery of animal navigation, and 3D sharks, at the city's Imax cinema (October 16, 17, 18, 20 and 22). Screenings run until the finals of the festival's Panda Award where the public will have a chance to see the winners. Other public events include the Peter Scott Debate at Bristol University on October 17 when environmentalist Jonathan Porritt, US marine biologist Sylvia Earle and ecologist Philip Stott will tackle climate change, and WildPhotos, on October 20, when the world's leading nature photographers take a day off hiding from gorillas to share their experiences and advice. Antony Jones \u00b7 Wildscreen runs from tomorrow to October 20. For further information, visit www.wildscreenfestival.org or call 0117-915 7100 Make room for drawing Kids do it and most love it. But for some reason, as we get older we seem to lose the knack, or the confidence. So why not let your children take you to one of almost 1,000 events taking place today for Big Draw Day and throughout October (especially during half-term). Draw your descendants in Carlisle or fish scales in Cambridgeshire, speed draw in Oban, sketch iron-age objects in Andover, or in Lancashire make a drawing using just one continuous line and the line-following robot will walk it. In museums and galleries, castles and stately homes, shopping centres and village halls, you are invited to draw - portraits, cartoons, building designs - and not just on paper either: there will be drawing on ceramics, hats, postcards, pavements, computers, walls and even on a handful of museum exhibits! Organised by Drawing Power and backed by its patron Quentin Blake, this year's Big Draw is bigger than ever. Having already involved a million people in six years, it aims to get everyone drawing - even those of you who think you are hopeless. Christopher Frayling, rector of the Royal College of Art, says, \"Drawing isn't a 'craft' thing - it is all-embracing - a way of doing and a way of seeing.\" Better give it a try then. Jamie Brooks \u00b7 Searchable events list on www.thebigdraw.org.uk; www.drawingpower.org.uk Write yourself into history How do you fancy being part of history - part of the official historical record? Now is your chance. Adult or child, all you have to do is write a diary of your day on Tuesday October 17 and upload it on to the History Matters website - www.historymatters.co.uk - by the end of the month. Tuesday has been deliberately chosen as a perfectly ordinary weekday with no special significance, and designated One Day in History. Blog your day and it might be retained, with many thousands of others, in the British Library as a record of the life of the nation in the early 21st century. You can write as much or as little as you want - just describe your day. The only extra the organisers would like is anything you can say about how history affected your day (if at all).This doesn't require a thesis on national politics or Victorian sewage systems (though if you had a blocked ... no let's not go there), just things such as whether you walked past historical buildings on the way to work or school, whether you listened to music written in the past (and please note, parents, it doesn't have to be the distant past; for your kids it could mean your favourite 80s rock band!), or looked at some old family photos. Juliet Rix Shoot an arrow in Harold's eye Travel back in time 940 years to the day modern history began - the Battle of Hastings 1066. Saxons and Normans will be clashing swords again this weekend as some 2,000 re-enactors and more than 100 horses surge towards one another over the original battlefield in a huge anniversary recreation. Knights, foot soldiers and archers will fight it out until William of Normandy becomes William the Conqueror and King Harold of England lies dead. You can even stand on the very spot where King Harold fell, so they say, with an arrow in his eye. Behind the frontline you will be able to visit encampments of Normans and Saxons to see how soldiers and ordinary people lived, cooked and clothed themselves. There will be 11th-century music (on bells, claves, horn, harp and organistrum!) and a bustling marketplace with traders making and selling boots and other leather goods, ceramics and weaponry. Kids can help colour in a huge outline of the Bayeux tapestry, play games popular in the middle ages - skittles, coits, fox &amp; geese - and see a humorous show about the medicine of the period. On each day of the weekend, King Harold will arrive at noon with battle commencing at 3pm and ending at 5pm. And if you can't get there in person, then from Monday October 16, there will be a film of the battle on the English Heritage website, www.english-heritage.org.uk/1066.
