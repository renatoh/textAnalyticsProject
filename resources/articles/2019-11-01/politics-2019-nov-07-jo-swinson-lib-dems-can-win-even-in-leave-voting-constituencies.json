In a show of confidence, Swinson\u2019s bus rolled into North East Somerset \u2013 Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s constituency \u2013 on Thursday for a visit to a forest school nursery. Swinson lit fires, whittled a hazel stick, toasted marshmallows and argued that the excellent results in the local election results in May that put the Lib Dems in charge of places like Banes (Bath and North East Somerset) could be repeated in the general election. \u201cWe can win in places like this,\u201d she said. \u201cJacob Rees-Mogg has a Liberal Democrat councillor now. The Liberal Democrats are on the up in Somerset and the west country.\u201d Somerset was a Lib Dem heartland in the days of Paddy Ashdown, until the party\u2019s collapse in the 2015 general election. Since then it has has clawed its way back with good results in council and EU elections. Winning in the North East Somerset parliamentary constituency, however, still seems a stretch. Rees-Mogg had a 10,000 majority over Labour in 2017, with the Lib Dems a distant third, followed by the Greens. The \u201cunite to remain\u201d pact means that the Greens are standing aside in the Bath constituency \u2013 but not in neighbouring North East Somerset, so are likely to split the remain vote there. In other west of England seats such as Exeter, Stroud and the Forest of Dean, the Lib Dems are standing aside to give the Greens a run. Asked why she wasn\u2019t giving people in such places a chance to vote for her party, Swinson said: \u201cThis is an unusual election. I think politics needs to be done differently. There are other parties that want to stop Brexit. If we can work together to make that happen, then I\u2019m proud to be able to do that.\u201d Many places in the West Country voted to leave the EU. Swinson argued that lots of people had changed their minds. \u201cLiberal Democrats will be standing in the vast majority of constituencies. It is still possible to stop Brexit. In most places, the best way to do this is by returning a Liberal Democrat member of parliament.\u201d The visit to a forest school nursery, where children learn outdoor skills, was designed to draw attention to the party\u2019s announcements about renewable energy and insulating homes. But the sight of Swinson\u2019s diesel battle bus \u2013 Somerset was out of range for its electric one \u2013 arriving in the rustic schoolyard proved a little jarring. Swinson denied that the Lib Dems\u2019 pact with the Greens in some areas meant they were being forced to put greater emphasis on green initiatives. \u201cWe have a strong record for standing up to protect the environment,\u201d she said. During a question-and-answer session with parents, Swinson discussed issues ranging from the shortages of affordable housing in the area to bovine TB. Outside, David Wood revealed proudly that he was Rees-Mogg\u2019s Lib Dem councillor, beating the former Tory leader of Banes in May\u2019s elections. \u201cThey said that wasn\u2019t possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe proved it was. As soon as you come along with a credible alternative, people will latch on to it.\u201d His fellow councillor, Andy Wait, who won in Keynsham East against the odds, added: \u201cThings are changing. These are weird times.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
