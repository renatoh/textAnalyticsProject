The Spaniard was culpable for both of the City goals. 2/10 Ashley Young Responded to recent criticism with a compact display in a solid rearguard (De Gea apart). 5 Matteo Darmian First league start under Solskj\u00e6r and he was accomplished enough to vindicate selection. 6 Chris Smalling Had a near-nightmare moment, nearly deflecting a shot into his own goal \u2013 but De Gea saved. 6 Victor Lindel\u00f6f Was rarely troubled by City\u2019s attackers in what was a smooth display from United\u2019s best centre\u2011back. 7 Luke Shaw Pace was a threat on his return from three\u2011game ban but he faded after the break. Booked. 6 Paul Pogba Would he bring his A-game? This was the good Pogba who always looked to be positive. 7 Fred Composed and classy, and did all of the running expected of a holding midfielder. 7 Andreas Pereira Was cultured in arguably his best display in United colours \u2013 unlucky to be replaced. Booked. 7 Marcus Rashford Troubled Kompany and Laporte at times but will be frustrated at not capitalising on his ascendancy. 7 Jesse Lingard Harried and hassled defenders but missed two golden chances to score, the second an open goal. 5 Subs: Romelu Lukaku (for Pereira, 72) 6; Anthony Martial (for Lingard, 83) 5; Alexis S\u00e1nchez (for Darmian, 83) 5. Manchester City Ederson Passing not always precise but made one superb interception from Lingard\u2019s ball to deny Rashford. 7/10 Kyle Walker Hit one pass straight out, was shaky and failed to join the attack enough to aid his team. 4 Vincent Kompany Booked inside 10 minutes in what was a torrid evening in 18th league outing in a derby. Booked. 5 Aymeric Laporte Like Kompany, he could not handle Rashford early on in one of his poorer displays this term. 5 Oleksandr Zinchenko Struggled with the pace and when booked put himself under pressure. Booked. 5 Fernandinho Was the pick of City\u2019s midfielders until he had to limp off early in second half after tackle on Pogba. 7 David Silva Could have been sent off for a boot in Pereira\u2019s chest but was also a telling influence. 7 Ilkay G\u00fcndogan Was initially unable to control the midfield for City but became more of a factor as the game went on. 7 Bernardo Silva Like his team, got better as the contest progressed and scored a fine goal to break the deadlock. 8 Sergio Ag\u00fcero Given little service up front but was still sharp and difficult for the home team to contain. 7 Raheem Sterling Should have scored opener as the interval neared but was instrumental in City\u2019s second strike. 7 Subs: Leroy San\u00e9 (for Fernandinho, 51) 7; Jesus (for Ag\u00fcero, 89) 6, Danilo (for G\u00fcndogan, 89) 6."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
