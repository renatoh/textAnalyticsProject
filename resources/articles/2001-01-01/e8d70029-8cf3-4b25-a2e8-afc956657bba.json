Intelligence officers in Rwanda, which supports rebels battling Kabila's government, however, said they had unconfirmed reports that Kabila was dead. Senior Congolese officials insisted their president was alive. \"President Kabila is alive and everything is OK,\" said Congolese Gen. Francois Olenga. He gave no further details. A member of Kabila's security entourage said on condition of anonymity that a bodyguard had shot the president in the back and right leg. Kabila was alive and was being treated by doctors, he said. A senior military official in the neighbouring Republic of Congo also said Kabila had been wounded, adding it was unclear who was in control of the Kinshasa government. The official, who also declined to be named, spoke from his country's capital of Brazzaville. The conflicting reports came hours after witnesses told of 30 minutes of gunfire around the home of Kabila, who has been fighting multiple rebel armies for more than two years. It was unclear who was responsible for the shooting. A presidential helicopter landed at Kinshasa's main hospital, a government official who witnessed the event said, adding there were unconfirmed reports that the aircraft was carrying Kabila's son, Joseph, who had apparently also been injured. The younger Kabila is the head of Congo's military. Presidential aide Eddy Kapend went on national television shortly after the shooting ended to appeal for calm, but he made no mention of the incident. The bleary-eyed Kapend ordered that all airports and borders be closed, appealing to the armed forces and civil society leaders to help maintain order. \"The Congolese people need your serenity and your discipline,\" he said. Amid the confusion, Kinshasa residents hurried home, and many streets were quickly deserted. Truckloads of armed soldiers patrolled the streets in the capital city of the vast Central African nation. Large numbers of troops in armored vehicles and on foot blocked off roads near Kabila's hilltop residence not far from downtown Kinshasa. The presidential residence, known as the Marble Palace, is usually heavily guarded by troops and a North Korean-made tank. Uganda and Rwanda support Congolese rebels who have been fighting to overthrow Mr Kabila since August 1998. In recent months, the Rwandan-backed rebels have beaten back Congolese troops and their Zimbabwean allies. Mr Kabila took over the country in May 1997 after overthrowing the long-term ruler, Mobutu Sese Seko, changing the country's name from Zaire to Congo when he became president.
