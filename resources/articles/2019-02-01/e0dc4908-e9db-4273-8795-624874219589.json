On Thursday Broughton, 30, was found guilty of manslaughter after giving his girlfriend, Louella Fletcher-Michie, a fatal dose of drugs at the Bestival music festival in September 2017. Footage found on his phone showed him \u201cexhorting [another woman] to take more\u201d of a substance he had given her, while he also took an image of a girlfriend who had injured herself while taking drugs, according to the prosecutor, William Mousley QC. He sought permission to have the claims presented to the jury at Winchester crown court as evidence during the trial, as he attempted to establish what he said was Broughton\u2019s \u201cpattern of behaviour\u201d. However, the judge rejected the request, though he came to no conclusion in respect of the credibility of the claims, saying it would do little to assist the jury and that it was too late to introduce evidence fairly. The footage, which was played in court in the jurors\u2019 absence, showed an unnamed woman sniffing a substance on a spoon held by Broughton. He told her: \u201cNo, no, you have to do more.\u201d The woman snorted from the spoon again. The court also heard that a woman named Paulina Aberg, who lives in Sweden, claimed Broughton photographed her after she fell and banged her head while taking drugs. Mousley said Aberg found an image of herself on Broughton\u2019s phone, which she deleted. \u201cShe also says over and above that specific incident that she was aware that the defendant had images of people suffering, including suffering death, on his phone in which he appeared to have some interest,\u201d the prosecutor added. He said the potential evidence was \u201ccapable of establishing a pattern of behaviour which supported the prosecution case\u201d. Broughton\u2019s lawyer, Stephen Kamlish QC, said Aberg\u2019s claims about her fall were \u201cnot true\u201d. He added: \u201cWhether or not the defendant was with her when it happened, he didn\u2019t know she was hurt because she has to tell him,\u201d Kamlish said. Kamlish argued the evidence might make the jury think Broughton \u201ctook an unhealthy pleasure in Louella\u2019s suffering\u201d, which had \u201cnever\u201d been the case. He said Fletcher-Michie, daughter of the Holby City actor John Michie, had wanted to take drugs at Bestival and Broughton had admitted providing her with some on a previous occasion. \u201cThis has never been the case of the defendant forcing drugs on anyone, they go off to take drugs together because she wants to,\u201d he said. In a written ruling given to the Press Association, judge Mr Justice Goose said the video clips \u201coffer little, if anything to assist the jury\u201d because the type and supply of the drug being offered was unclear. The judge added there was \u201cno doubt the deceased wanted to take drugs\u201d at Bestival and Broughton had already admitted supplying drugs to her in June 2017. Goose said Aberg\u2019s statement had come too late to \u201cbe fair to the defence\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
