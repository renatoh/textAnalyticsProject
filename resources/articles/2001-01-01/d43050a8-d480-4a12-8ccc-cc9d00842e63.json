The third of its five movements has been largely responsible for that popularity, for the whole structure pivots about this tour de force of musical memory, which uses the scherzo from Mahler's Resurrection Symphony as the framework for a collage of quotations that compresses the musical history of the 20th-century into a single span. As a group of vocalists (the Swingle Singers in the early performances) offer a commentary culled from Samuel Beckett's The Unnameable, the orchestra sets out on Mahler's scherzo only to be constantly diverted by other references - Debussy's La Mer flashes by, so do fragments of Stravinsky and Schoenberg, Ravel and Alban Berg. As the journey unfolds, Mahler's structure gradually disintegrates,' the quotations get closer and closer to Berio's own time (with references to Boulez and Stockhausen), and finally as the Beckett quotations become more and more desperate, the movement peters out. It is a piece of intense compositional virtuosity and instant appeal. Cultural cross-referencing of this kind was very much a feature of music in the 1960s, and Berio extends that process into the other movements as well. The first compiles fragments of texts from the anthropologist Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, the second is a tribute to Martin Luther King. When the Sinfonia was premiered, it consisted of just four movements, with just a quiet postlude following the Mahler collage, but soon afterwards Berio added a fifth section, which revisits what has come before in the same way that the rest of the work feeds upon deeper historical associations. The composer's own performance of the work was recorded just after the premiere with the New York Philharmonic and the Swingle Singers, and only includes the original four movements (Sony Classical), but the three subsequent versions have all used the full version of the score. Pierre Boulez's on Erato was the first of those, characteristically lucid and mastering all the problems of balance that this multi-layered work throws up, though his recording's very forward placement of the voices in the third movement is problematic; they are not soloists, but one element in Berio's ever-changing iridescent web of colours, and should be heard as such. Both the more recent recordings - Semyon Bychkov with the Orchestre de Paris (Philips) and Riccardo Chailly with the Royal Concertgebouw (Decca) - get that right, though Chailly's is the one to go for: not only do the other Berio works on his disc (Formazioni and the Folk Songs) make for a more valuable collection, but he, unlike Bychkov, manages to preserve the sense of freshness in the Sinfonia, to convey the sheer vitality of the invention and the one-off brilliance of its third movement.
