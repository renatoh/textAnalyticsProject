Cold and draughty Victorian houses with stone floors killed the house mites and mould that trigger many allergies, but central heating, double glazing and fitted carpets are the ideal habitat for them. Many modern house-building materials, such as fibreboard, anti-rot treated timber and oil-based paint also contribute to allergies by giving off vapours as they dry. Small wonder that people are beginning to look at the design of their houses to see how allergies can be contained. But there are things householders can do to control dust mites in conventional homes, says Muriel Simmons, chief executive of Allergy UK (formerly the British Allergy Foundation). 'Most houses these days lack ventilation and are breeding grounds for mould. Turning down the central heating even by one degree can help,' she says. 'You can clean out the breeding grounds for house mites by putting bed linen and pillows in the freezer overnight and spreading pea shingle on the earth around plant pots.' But in the long term, allergy sufferers need to consider better house design. 'We have found that archi tects are very aware of allergies and want to produce homes that are as safe as possible,' she says. Developers are already experimenting with designs that minimise exposure to allergens. At the Kingshill Park and Lacuna developments at West Malling, Kent, Environ Sunley is building 'Super-E' environmentally friendly and non-allergenic houses imported from Canada. The main anti-allergy feature of the house is its hot air heating system. The boiler heats air that is filtered and distributed through the house by ducts. The outgoing air passes through a heat exchanger to heat the incoming air, so energy is not wasted. Circulating the air means elimination of ventilation holes that allow air carrying allergens such as pollen in, and also maintains humidity at a level that is nice for humans and horrible for house mites. But the anti-allergenic properties go further, says Andy Wibling of Environ Sunley. 'We liked the design because it took the poisons out of the timber frame itself, using a boron treatment to protect against rot and beetles. 'To get the Super-E badge you have to use water-based paints and the doors have to be made of environmentally friendly material, ' he says. Fitted carpets are banned. 'The floors are covered with laminated wood to allow easy cleaning, so allergies are not triggered by dust in the carpets,' says Wibling. Outside, the Super-E house is a traditional mix of weatherboarding and tiling, though even the 'timber' cladding is designed to avoid the use of creosote - the boards are made of maintenance-free concrete. All this comes at a price, of course. Wibling now wants to find out if people will pay extra for houses that don't cause allergies. 'We want to see how the market reacts. Super-E houses cost an extra 6 to 8 per cent to build but we have sold other ecological homes for a slight premium,' he says. Prices at Kings Hill Park start at about \u00a3385,000 for an apartment and rise to \u00a3895,000 for a large, five-bedroom house - details on 01732 871872. Keeping household allergens at bay is especially important in cities, where traffic noise and pollution means that windows are usually kept shut. Jonathan Thurston of developer Landminster is converting a line of grand Victorian houses in central London's Lancaster Gate into flats with 'healthy' features. Thurston believes our houses can make us ill. 'We know about sick office syndrome, and there is no reason why we can't get sick house syndrome,' he says. 'People hardly ever open windows any more because of security fears and the noise and pollution in the city.' The flats have solid, easily washable floors with no carpets, and an air circulation system to combat house mites. 'The ventilation system vacuums the air,' Thurston says. 'It can be set to change the air from once to three times an hour, and the filter cleans the air to the same standard as a hospital - it even filters out anthrax.' Vacuum cleaners are often very little use against the house mite, because the mites are so small they sim ply go through the machine and spread out over the room again. So Thurston has installed central vacuuming systems with pumps connected by pipes to 'vacuum sockets' in every room. To clean a room, a hose is plugged into a socket and the pump sucks every mite safely into a canister in the basement, for removal by the dustmen. The next generation of allergy-busting technology will be installed in the 14 flats Thurston is carving out of the houses next door, Nos 19/21 Lancaster Gate. A high-velocity ducted air system is being fitted in each flat that circulates air from a heat pump and chiller through narrow ducts to every room. The air is purified by a military-grade system originally developed at Porton Down that zaps everything from anthrax spores to Sars-like viruses. The system maintains humidity at a comfortable 45 per cent and the cooling system means that windows do not have to be opened in summer to let in all the dust and bugs the filters so expensively remove. The flats at 17 Lancaster Gate are on the market at prices starting at \u00a3865,000 for two-bedroom units, rising to \u00a31.6 million for three bedrooms. The 14 flats at 19/20 Lancaster Gate will be available in February next year at prices between \u00a3400,000 for a huge studio flat to \u00a32m for a three-bedroom flat.

The Peabody Trust's BedZed development of affordable housing in south London is mainly known for its environmentally friendly architecture, but the design is also intended to help allergy sufferers. Low-emission paints and timbers cut down on allergens such as formaldehyde and the air is filtered and changed regularly by a passive stack ventilation system - the gaily painted cowls on top of the stacks are a prominent feature of the block. The ventilation means air is maintained at the right humidity to avoid build-up of mould and mites."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
