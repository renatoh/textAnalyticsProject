It was a trip to Holland three years ago. Our family has our own boat - we keep it moored on the River Orwell in Ipswich. Most of our holidays are centred around it, and we've had lots of good trips in the UK and to France as well as Holland. But this trip to Holland was the best ever: I think it was because everything was really set up for families. We sailed to Vlissingen, and then we went into the canals and stopped at towns like Veere. The whole area is blocked off with waterways and little islands, all catering for holidaymakers - and the mooring cost us around \u00a35 a night. Do you have a say in where you go? Dad usually makes the decision because he's the real sailing expert and he's the person who thinks about logistics and safety. But once we get to a place, we make joint decisions about what we'll head for. What do you like doing most on holiday? The great thing about a sailing holiday is you have to function as a team, and you have lots of time to just sit and chat, so it really brings you together. The other thing we've done a lot of is camping: hotels are too expensive for a family our size. My favourite campsite was a place called Tros-Y-Waen, which is at the foot of Snowdon: you could get really involved in every- thing to do with running the farm. What's your favourite way to travel? No surprises here - it's by sea. There's something so exciting about setting off from your home port and then crossing to another country in your own boat: it took us 20 hours to reach Holland. Any tips for parents on holiday? Parents need to realise that it's not OK to just keep going back to the same places: you have to keep doing your research so you come up with new places to visit. \u00b7 For information on sailing holidays in Zeeland, see holland.com.
