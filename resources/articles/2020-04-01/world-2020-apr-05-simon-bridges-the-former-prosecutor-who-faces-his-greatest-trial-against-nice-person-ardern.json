Bridges, the leader of the parliamentary opposition and of the centre-right National party, suspended campaigning for September\u2019s poll last month as lawmakers across the political spectrum united to endorse a four-week shutdown over the Covid-19 pandemic. But despite the cross-party display of support for measures to combat the virus\u2019 spread, politics for Bridges is never far away. A post on his Facebook page is soliciting support for his call to quarantine everyone entering New Zealand \u2013 currently, the government is allowing some to self-isolate at home \u2013 and urges the public to message him directly with their problems or complaints during the lockdown. And Bridges, 43, has jumped at the opportunity, in his new position as leader of a parliamentary committee scrutinising the government\u2019s decisions on Covid-19, to grill those in power. \u201cI think actually the scrutiny and the sunlight\u2019s working,\u201d he told a radio interviewer on Friday, referring to the committee\u2019s daily sittings, held on a publicly livestreamed video call. \u201cWe\u2019re dragging out more openness and transparency behind the press conferences.\u201d Jacinda Ardern, the country\u2019s prime minister \u2013 an adroit and empathetic communicator \u2013 is in her element in a crisis, and one of the world\u2019s most popular leaders. But if an election is held in September as scheduled, Bridges told the Guardian in a February interview that he was not worried about his rival\u2019s global profile. \u201cI see when I go overseas, our prime minister \u2013 and therefore the government \u2013 has this strong reputation and that\u2019s amazing,\u201d he says,upbeat but underscored by his trademark bluntness, on a couch in his office at New Zealand\u2019s parliament. \u201cBut of course for New Zealanders at home, that international work is only so good as your domestic record and that is, I clearly think, lacking.\u201d Pitching economic clout Like Ardern, Bridges has a young family at home. His three children \u2013 aged seven, five and two \u2013 and wife Natalie live in the port city of Tauranga in the Bay of Plenty in the North Island. He has brought to Wellington the relaxed, casual demeanour of the beachfront city, though he admits he has no life beyond politics, his family, and a little Netflix, and has never learned to surf. But where Ardern has built a reputation for exhorting a politics of kindness, Bridges is painted by his detractors as too negative, not likeable enough, maladroit in sensitive situations. The former prosecutor \u2013 who almost burned out in the job because, he tells the Guardian, he obsessed over each case he presented before a court \u2013 says that depiction of him is wrong. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has a monopoly on compassion,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019s always what people say that defines that. I think it is one\u2019s acts in government that show that.\u201d While polling data has not been published since Ardern shut down the country last Wednesday \u2013 a move that was widely supported to combat Covid-19, but is expected to deepen a recession forecast for the country \u2013 a 1News Colmar Brunton poll in February suggested it would be Bridges\u2019 National that would form the government after a vote in September, with a razor-thin, two-seat majority over the left-wing coalition led by Labour. But that was when the threat of Covid-19 still felt far from New Zealand\u2019s shores; now, the vote is likely to come down to whether people believe Ardern\u2019s party or Bridges\u2019 can better steer New Zealand\u2019s ship through an economic shock expected to be worse than the 2008 global financial crisis. Bridges is making the pitch that it\u2019s him. An economic speech touted as the centrepiece of his election-year pitch in February promised lower taxes, more jobs, boosts to GDP and debt reduction. As the impact of the pandemic became apparent in the past month, Bridges told the Guardian those pledges remained \u2013 and that Covid-19 \u201ccalls for more boldness in our actions\u201d on the economy. While New Zealanders are often uncomfortable with displays of naked ambition, he says Ardern\u2019s wish for the country \u2013 that everyone might have the basics for life covered \u2013 is \u201cnot remotely ambitious and aspirational enough\u201d. \u201cI want my three children to be world beaters,\u201d he says. \u201cI know with an English wife that they have options and I don\u2019t want them to spend their adult years in the UK. I want this to be a world beating economy and country where they can \u2026 not just exist happily but thrive.\u201d Bridges and his party are not centre-right in the way some comparable countries understand the term; the lawmaker is a full-throated supporter of New Zealand\u2019s free healthcare and schooling systems, and says he would consider climate change in his economic proposals were he prime minister. But in other ways he is an inveterate conservative: he believes New Zealanders will vote for lower taxes, would not use the term \u201cclimate emergency\u201d and disagrees with what he calls \u201cpreaching\u201d on the topic in schools. He recalls a former parliamentary colleague telling visiting Americans that \u201cin New Zealand, the Labour party\u2019s like the Democrats and the National party\u2019s like the Democrats\u201d. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t overly caricature it, but New Zealanders, I think, are a caring, compassionate society \u2013 dare I say it, and maybe I\u2019ll regret saying this, but I think a bit more so than [Australia].\u201d \u2018I also have a moral obligation to ask hard questions\u2019 When the Guardian met Bridges in February, he expected the election to be close, but was buoyant about his chances. He is relaxed and familiar in conversation, with a tendency to warn that he is about to be candid, or to say something he \u201cmight later regret,\u201d before voicing an entirely uncontroversial opinion in line with his political views. It is \u201ccandid\u201d, for example, for him to suggest that people might vote for Labour come September because Ardern, in her first term as leader, is \u201ca nice person\u201d with good intentions and deserves another chance, even if they don\u2019t feel the government has delivered on its promises, particularly on the country\u2019s housing crisis. September\u2019s poll will be Bridges\u2019 first as National and opposition leader; he won the role after Bill English stepped down in 2018. Seen as a bright, young talent during National\u2019s time in power, Bridges entered parliament as a 32-year-old lawmaker who was Oxford-educated \u2013 but the son of a clergyman and a school teacher \u2013 telegenic and with a politically enviable background prosecuting criminals. He was awarded frequent promotions and hefty portfolios, becoming minister for transport and economic development. New Zealand\u2019s politicians, when interviewed \u2013 perhaps cautious of the public\u2019s preference for humility in leaders \u2013 often protest that they dislike parliament; it\u2019s a necessary evil, not something they would ever choose. Bridges enjoys it. \u201cI think once you understand that it\u2019s a place of theatre, it\u2019s symbolically very important that arguments in parliament are good,\u201d he says. He is less sanguine about brickbats from \u201cthe left and the Twitterati\u201d that he says frequently misconstrue his positions. In contrast to Ardern \u2013 who frequently receives glowing media attention for her party\u2019s social media posts, and has called all New Zealand\u2019s leaders to commit to factual and transparent campaigning, which Bridges says he supports \u2013 his party, he says, is nitpicked unfairly. \u201cThey seek to hold National to a higher standard of these things and are on the lookout for it every second of the day,\u201d he says. He is sometimes accused by his critics of inappropriately politicising situations; where Ardern plays politics, but subtly, his speeches are often battering rams. \u201cI think they are unfair,\u201d he says of reproaches that he should not have criticised the government over its initial Covid-19 response. \u201cI have often been constructive but I also have a moral obligation to ask hard questions and push the government along for the good of New Zealand.\u201d Bridges laughs off questions of whether he is likeable enough to lead National to victory; he has previously said it is not an essential trait in a prime minister. \u201cI\u2019m more worried sometimes that I\u2019m not overly hardened to valid criticism and that I have some sensitivity there,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t get worked up about what Mrs Jones says to me in an email or what I read on Twitter but I do want to be sensitive enough that where they\u2019re saying you\u2019ve got that wrong, and you can improve in this way, I seek to do that.\u201d What\u2019s an example? \u201cI wear better-fitting suits these days,\u201d he says. When Bridges meets aspiring political candidates, he tries to dissuade them from running for office if they are already doing well in their careers. But he does not regret his move to leave the courtroom behind. \u201cYou think you really enjoy something and certainly I found it satisfying, but the day I resigned to be the Tauranga candidate for the National party, a weight lifted off my shoulders,\u201d Bridges says. \u201cI used to find sleeping quite hard when I was in cases, I\u2019d always have my cross examination and my closing arguments rolling over my head, because I wanted to get it perfect for the jury and the victim. \u201cAs my wife would attest, now in politics I sleep like a baby.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
