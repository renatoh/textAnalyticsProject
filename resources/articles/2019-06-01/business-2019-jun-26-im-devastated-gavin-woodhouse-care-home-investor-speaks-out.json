He was told that Clifton Moor would be operational and generating profits from last year but, at the site near Wigan, there is an overgrown plot where the care home should now be. Devadoss was expecting his first interest payment of \u00a378,000 from Woodhouse\u2019s company, Northern Powerhouse Developments (NPD), on 6 June this year but it has yet to arrive. He is disturbed to discover the status of the site. \u201cI was expecting a nursing home with 70 beds, so I\u2019m really shocked to see that nothing has happened,\u201d he said earlier this month. \u201cIf my wife was here, she would start to cry. I\u2019m really upset but what else can I do? \u201c[I\u2019m] devastated and really disgusted; more so because my wife is so upset. She is in a position where she has to carry on working. \u201cWe were banking on [the interest payment] for our future. It is our real lifetime savings and pension for us. Because of this both of us have to rethink our plans and carry on working.\u201d Devadoss is not the only investor in Woodhouse\u2019s care home projects who is concerned about what might happen to their savings. Earlier this year Woodhouse wrote to investors admitting to cashflow problems and telling them he would be rescheduling their dividends. Another investor, who did not want to be named but put about \u00a340,000 into the Walsden care home project in West Yorkshire in 2014, said: \u201cWhen my dad died, he said to me: \u2018Put the money that you will get from the house into property.\u2019 So we followed his advice. We thought this [project] is really good, it fits in with the amount we can afford and it\u2019s a really worthwhile thing because we like to be altruistic and help other people through life.\u201d Annual scheduled dividends have been delayed in each year of the investment and only received after sustained chasing. It has left the investor worried if they will ever see their money again. \u201cI wish I\u2019d never seen [this investment] \u2026 There are so many people who have put much more than we have into it and my heart bleeds for them. I really don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll get the money at all. There was my dad giving what he thought was sensible advice and I sort of let him down. It\u2019s quite upsetting really. I feel I\u2019ve been taken for a mug, as so many people have.\u201d In Burnley at Hawthorn, the third unbuilt care home for which Woodhouse raised funds, another investor who did not want to be identified has been trying to confirm that his money is safe for almost a year. Communications with NPD\u2019s sales agents had left him with the firm impression that the funds raised to build Hawthorn were being safeguarded by Woodhouse\u2019s solicitor, Metis Law. But repeated efforts to obtain proof the money was safe were frustrated over many months. \u201cAll I\u2019m asking for is that they are holding \u00a350,000 of my money somewhere safe. I don\u2019t know what the difficulty is,\u201d the investor told the Guardian. Rajat Sharma, a partner at Metis Law, said: \u201cThe solicitors\u2019 professional rules prohibit the firm from engaging in any dialogue with third parties about any client\u2019s affairs without the express consent of that client. In the case of Northern Powerhouse Developments Ltd, we did not have that consent. Accordingly, we were unable to answer investors\u2019 questions.\u201d Woodhouse now says the funds are not with Metis but \u201cin bank accounts, which are separate and allocated to each SPV [special project vehicle]\u201d. A spokesman for NPD said: \u201cWe have up to 600 investors, the vast majority of which have not voiced concerns. The allegations made by the Guardian and ITV concern a handful of disgruntled investors and do not reflect the view of investors in Northern Powerhouse Developments as a whole.\u201d Northern Powerhouse Developments denies any wrongdoing. Here is its complete response."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
