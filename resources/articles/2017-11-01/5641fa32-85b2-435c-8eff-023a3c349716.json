When someone looks, plays and behaves like a top player, even if he is not the established first choice, Baxter reckons international coaches should trust their own eyes. Jones, in naming Henry Slade at 12 against the Pumas on Saturday, has done precisely that. It is possible for even the most experienced head coaches to lose sight of what really matters in the blizzard of wellness stats, hydration readings and assorted other supposedly essential facts they are now buried beneath on a daily basis. Jones complained to his squad in their morning meeting that he is starting to feel like the team\u2019s data analyst but he scarcely needed a spreadsheet to identify the most enticing replacement for the rested Owen Farrell. Slade is not the biggest, heaviest, quickest or the most prolific try-scorer to play centre for England but his work on the training field and domestic form for the Chiefs has ultimately trumped all else. As Jones acknowledged, the 24-year-old has \u201cgot everything there is \u2026 he\u2019s got nice feet, good balance, a good head on him, some speed, courage.\u201d Which begs the obvious question: why has he never started for England at inside-centre before? Jones, it turns out, has been pondering the same thing ever since Slade performed so well in England\u2019s World Cup warmup Test against France at Twickenham in 2015 that he propelled Sam Burgess, his midfield partner that day, into Stuart Lancaster\u2019s final squad. \u201cI remember seeing this kid who had feet, nice balance and speed,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThen I didn\u2019t see him again. I thought he\u2019d been taken somewhere.\u201d Admittedly Slade, by his own admission, took a while to shake off the mental and physical after-effects of the horrible lower leg fracture he suffered at Wasps in December 2015 but until this summer\u2019s tour to Argentina he had not started a match for his country since the Uruguay pool game in Manchester that concluded Lancaster\u2019s tenure. Despite the Chiefs\u2019 walking off with last year\u2019s Premiership title, Jones\u2019s niggling doubt was the Devonian\u2019s work rate off the ball, regardless of his priceless, rare gift of time on it. \u201cSometimes those really talented kids don\u2019t understand how you have to work hard, to change that talent into consistent performance,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe\u2019s really learned that.\u201d All it took, in the end, was one specific measurement to back up Jones\u2019s intensifying gut feeling. \u201cOne of the most important stats we collect is on high-speed running. Imagine we kick the ball and you have to sprint after that ball. Then the ball goes back over your head and you\u2019ve got to sprint back. He was the lowest in our team 12 months ago. On Tuesday he was the highest. He\u2019s learned he has to do the small things well and he\u2019s done that brilliantly.\u201d It did no harm that Slade started both wins against the Pumas. Coincidence or not, England have also won all seven of his Tests. The next task is to make it impossible for Jones to drop him, regardless of who may be available to face Australia, and his new midfield partner, Jonathan Joseph, certainly sounds excited. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to playing with him,\u201d said the Bath centre. \u201cSomething special could work there. His distribution, his ability to see space \u2026 it\u2019s what outside-backs thrive off.\u201d If it does work, with George Ford pulling the strings and Elliot Daly and Anthony Watson creating havoc out wide, Jones will have some tricky calls to make. He is hardly going to omit Farrell but the Saracen feels happiest at 10, which would mean dropping Ford to the bench. And what about Ben Te\u2019o, Manu Tuilagi, Alex Lozowski and Piers Francis, to mention just four other candidates for the No12 jersey? Even Slade would be unwise to assume anything yet. \u201cThis is Sladey\u2019s opportunity to show he can be a third choice at 12 \u2013 or one of the choices at 12,\u201d said Jones, reserving the right to keep his options open. What Jones describes as a \u201csparring match\u201d in the buildup to the \u201cheavyweight contests in the 2019 World Cup\u201d will certainly be a significant one for south Devon with the Teignmouth-reared Sam Simmonds set to win his first cap off the bench after the unlucky Tom Curry damaged a wrist in training. Above all else, however, Jones wants his pack to come snorting out of the autumn blocks \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s where the game is won or lost \u2026 if you get good quality ball then the little guys can run with it\u201d \u2013 and not to underestimate Argentina. \u201cThey know if they beat England at Twickenham then their whole season turns around. They\u2019ll go back to Buenos Aires, sit on the beach as heroes and everyone will want to buy them a beer and a steak,\u201d he said. England, having defeated the Pumas three times this year, want their visitors to return home empty-handed once again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
