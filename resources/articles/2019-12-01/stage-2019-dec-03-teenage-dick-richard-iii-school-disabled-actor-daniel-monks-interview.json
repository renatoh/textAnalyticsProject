What begins as a gleeful, knowing reboot of Richard III in an all-American high school, gradually skews darker. Richard, a disabled 17-year-old, connives against the school jock to become senior-year president \u2013 but like his Shakespearean predecessor his rise is also a fall. Many of us are shadowed by our unhappy teenaged selves. American playwright Mike Lew hoped to \u201cchannel the frustrations of being that age. It\u2019s a really vulnerable age, and where you put those insecurities was interesting to me. That age is so traumatising, it\u2019s very easy to fall back.\u201d Daniel Monks, taking the title role in the British premiere, also carries his adolescent self with him. Despite becoming head boy of his Australian high school (not, he clarifies, by Richard\u2019s \u201cnefarious means\u201d), he found growing up difficult. \u201cI struggled with being a disabled teenager and a gay teenager and a gay, disabled teenager. Experiencing so much shame for anything that makes you perceived as different \u2013 I totally identify with a lot of the friction and pain in the play. Being a teenager just sucks.\u201d I sit in on a rehearsal at London\u2019s Donmar Warehouse where the cast and director Michael Longhurst dig into the characters. It\u2019s like a hilarious gossip session about everyone\u2019s imaginary friends. Lew, at one end of the table, keeps his counsel \u2013 arms crossed, eyes down. Monks, in contrast, is disarmingly jolly as he reads \u2013 a wide, guileless smile above a bright red T-shirt. You realise how underrated Richard might dodge everyone\u2019s defences. After hearing Monks in a reading of the play (\u201cI fortunately didn\u2019t realise it was a low-key audition\u201d), Lew has been more than willing to tailor the role. \u201cDaniel was like, \u2018You\u2019ve written this character with cerebral palsy, and I can play that \u2013 but I have hemiplegia.\u2019 I embraced that, because I\u2019ll always see what actors are giving me and try to make it bespoke.\u201d The text includes a non-negotiable casting note \u2013 Richard and his friend Buck must be played by disabled actors. \u201cTeenage Dick is meant to be a little bit of a poison pill, in that it seems so digestible,\u201d Lew explains, \u201cbut in order to produce it successfully, you have to rethink how you go about your daily business.\u201d Or, as Monks puts it, \u201cyou can\u2019t get the disabled narrative for free. You need to employ disabled actors to get it.\u201d Of course Richard III, with his oft-exaggerated hunchback and murderous instinct, is hardly a poster boy for disability. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about this a lot,\u201d Monks says, \u201chow, historically, disabled people were seen as marked by the devil. The reaction to that was that they\u2019re objects of pity \u2013 saintly or vulnerable. You very rarely have a chance to play a complex human being. It\u2019s a joy for an actor, exploring what it is to be a disabled person in a society that isn\u2019t made for you.\u201d With more than one disabled character in the play, Monks doesn\u2019t need to represent what he calls \u201can ambassador for the community. I want to make messy, complicated, fucked-up art.\u201d As a prominent Chinese-American playwright, does Lew embrace an ambassadorial role? \u201cNo,\u201d he says. Nonetheless, he is mindful of representation. \u201cA lot of the conversations I had with my friend Gregg Mozgala, who commissioned the play [it premiered off-Broadway in 2018], came out of the parallels between our roles in our communities.\u201d He hopes writers from perceived minorities will \u201coverwhelm the market with a volume of different takes, so that no one piece has that burden, of containing the entirety of an experience\u201d. Lew and his wife, Rehana Mirza, are joint writers-in-residence at California\u2019s La Jolla Playhouse, and are currently collaborating on something even more ambitious \u2013 a trilogy about British colonialism. \u201cA lot of American theatre is very ahistorical,\u201d he explains. Alongside this mighty project, he\u2019s also tackling wrenchingly personal material: their baby daughter\u2019s time in a neonatal intensive care unit after her premature birth earlier this year. Details of the experience are already receding, he says: \u201cYour brain is protecting you.\u201d Monks was an acting-obsessed kid (\u201cinsufferable, attention-seeking, living for the applause,\u201d he says cheerfully) before a botched operation at age 11 left him paralysed on his right side. Playing the lead in his debut film Pulse renewed his passion for performance. He is happy to parse his identity. \u201cI feel like having a lived experience of two minorities helps me critique the two communities. For example, the gay male community is over-sexualised and the disabled community is desexualised, so living between those is really strange. I\u2019ve experienced more ableism in the gay male community than anywhere, even the mainstream, whereas the disabled community is much more inclusive, because it really knows what it is like to be excluded.\u201d Now based in London, he says he\u2019s a \u201cbetter, richer actor\u201d because of the experiences he\u2019s gone through: \u201cInstead of acting for attention I\u2019m acting because I have stories to tell.\u201d \u2022 Teenage Dick is at the Donmar Warehouse, London, 6 December\u20131 February."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
