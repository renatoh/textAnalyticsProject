He will face Stefanos Tsitsipas as the next generation settles at the top of the sport. \u201cThis is just a big, big dream coming true for me,\u201d said Thiem. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best tournaments all year, one of the most prestigious and I\u2019m getting the chance to play the finals tomorrow. It\u2019s unreal.\u201d Thiem had arrived in the semi-final after one of the greatest two-match stretches of his life, becoming the first player to beat Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic in the same group at the ATP Finals. Conventional wisdom said indoor courts were simply not compatible with his elaborate groundstrokes that could be rushed on faster surfaces, but throughout the week he has vaporised such ideas with the force of a bullet forehand. Thiem struggled in the early exchanges as Zverev consistently rained down bombs over 140mph. The Austrian saved two break points early in the first set and he initially struggled with his first serve percentage, but he soon began to impose his vicious groundstrokes. Across the net, the German\u2019s composure crumbled as he failed to pressure Thiem\u2019s vulnerable serve. The quickfire holds in the first set finally gave way as Zverev sprayed a flurry of errors and found himself facing two set points at 6-5. On the second attempt, the German double faulted. As he sat in his seat between the set he tossed his racket across the court in disgust. The definitive break came when Thiem led 3-2, with plenty of help from Zverev as his game collapsed in a flurry of dire errors. Thiem broke with a forehand passing shot and he never looked back. Zverev left the court seething, but before he departed for his six day off-season, he previewed the final with a prediction. \u201cNext year will bring a new grand slam champion,\u201d said Zverev. \u201cWe\u2019ll see who that will be, because I think the young guys are playing incredible tennis.\u201d A defining year for Thiem will have a fitting finish as he chases his sixth title. At the beginning of the season he decided to step away from his long-time coach, Gunter Bresnik, who had directed most of his affairs since he was nine years old. At 26, he has finally learnt to make his own decisions and control his own destiny. He seems to like it. Alongside his new coach, Nicolas Massu, he has complemented his booming strokes with more variety and has ensured this week that he will never be called a clay-court specialist again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
