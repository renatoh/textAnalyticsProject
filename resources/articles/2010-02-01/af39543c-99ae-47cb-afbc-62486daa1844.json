The south London club, currently in administration and facing a race against time to find a buyer, would have expected \u00a3300,000 from ITV if the match were shown live. But the broadcaster is unlikely to show the game live if it takes place, as expected, on Wednesday 24 February. That date clashes with Champions League fixtures in the round of 16, which ITV also have the rights to. Under a new deal, ITV show matches played on Wednesday nights, not Tuesday as under its old contract. The broadcaster is also showing Europa League action that week. Because all fifth\u2011round replays involve at least one club playing the preceding Sunday, it will be impossible to play the games on a Tuesday night. And since the replay will probably take place four days before Villa face Manchester United in the Carling Cup final, the club are not expecting a full house and have reduced prices accordingly, which will hit Palace's share of the gate receipts. Brendan Guilfoyle, the club's administrator, today met administrators for the company that owns the freehold to Selhurst Park, to discuss the ground's future. It would cost any buyer an estimated \u00a312m to buy the freehold to Selhurst Park. Palace are around \u00a332m in debt, but \u00a320m of that is owed to the former owner Simon Jordan. Any deal to buy the club is likely to include a parallel deal on the ground. Guilfoyle believes the club has enough cash to make it to the end of the season, if the Football League and the Football Association release transfer funds and TV money they are currently holding. The FA also today asked the Palace manager, Neil Warnock, to explain his comments following his side's draw against Villa on Sunday. Warnock called for the assistant referee Trevor Massey to be banned for wrongly awarding the corner which led to Villa's late equaliser in the FA Cup fifth-round tie. The FA has given Warnock until 23 February, the day before the likely replay date, to lodge his response. Officials will digest his explanation before deciding whether he faces an improper conduct charge."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
