There is never a moment during this set, which promotes the Montreal septet's sixth album, Missiles, when Lightburn seems ready to lay down his alienation and kick up his heels. He stands front and centre, singing in a windswept baritone that evokes desolate midnight moors. If it were not for his leather jacket, he would make a great Heathcliff. So why aren't they more famous? In the past decade, Lightburn and his keyboardist wife, Natalia Yanchak - the only original members - have won moderate renown, peaking with the 2004 album No Cities Left (referenced tonight with Lost in the Plot and 22: Death of All the Romance). Meanwhile, their not-dissimilar fellow Canadians Arcade Fire are raking in the acclaim and awards. It must rankle, but the disparity makes sense when you see the Dears live, shuddering through a show that is big on free-floating anxiety - sonorously conveyed by Lightburn in lines such as: \"I've got to avenge everyone that washed up here in a sea of blood\" - but short on an unnamable something that would make it matter to people beyond their core audience. What they have going for them here, notably on new songs such as Disclaimer, is arresting harmonies that sound as if a demonic choir has taken up residence behind Lightburn. A roiling duet with Yanchak on Crisis 1&amp;2 offers a murky glimpse through layers of guitar into their marriage, and the deceptive, sea-shantyish lilt to Lights Off yields yet more mental turmoil as Lightburn urges: \"Admit thy defeat.\" Duly admitted. But where can the Dears go from here?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
