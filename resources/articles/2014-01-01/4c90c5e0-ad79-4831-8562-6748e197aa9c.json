As the wind and rain swept in off the south coast it was Mourinho who stood tall amid the storm and masterminded his side to a fourth league victory in five with two decisive substitutions. However, a convincing win ended with Mourinho fielding questions on Juan Mata's future at Chelsea. The Spaniard, whose withdrawal was met with despondency and an angry reaction when he reached the dugout, has been linked with a January transfer after falling down the pecking order and Mourinho did little to quell such talk by saying \"the club's door is open\". It was Oscar, Mata's replacement, who brought Chelsea to life against a Southampton side who had threatened during periods. The Brazilian also caused controversy when he was booked for a dive after knocking the ball past Kelvin Davis but his impact overall arguably won Chelsea the match. Oscar scored and had a hand in the goals by Fernando Torres and Willian. On Mata's reaction to being substituted, with the attacker hitting a seat in the dugout, Mourinho said: \"Juan's reaction I didn't see. I think his frustration was because of the result, because we know we have to win. At the end of the game everybody including him was happy in the dressing room and everybody was celebrating the victory. \"I want to keep him, I don't want him to go. That's my wish but my door is open and the club's door is open too. When a player wants to speak with us we are there waiting for them.\" Southampton enjoyed spells of dominance but were undone by a decisive double substitution. Oscar and Willian, introduced on 53 minutes, both scored after Torres had broken the deadlock but it was Oscar's dive that caused the greatest furore. He allowed his leg to drift into Davis's body as he tumbled to the turf with the score at 0-0. Mourinho said: \"Oscar is a clean player that was waiting for the goalkeeper to come and smash him because that normally happens in these situations. But the goalkeeper was not coming or he was coming and then he stopped. I think it is a fair yellow card for a clean player. We know that he is clean. \"His explanation to me I accept. Oscar found himself in a moment of contradiction, speaking about fractions of seconds, where he thinks contact, penalty, red card.\" Despite the atrocious conditions both sides were accomplished on the ball. Chelsea dominated in the opening 20 minutes, Torres darting inside off the left flank to beat two men before firing over, yet Southampton's cohesive attack soon clicked into gear. Having been on the pitch for only three minutes, Oscar was slipped through one on one by Eden Hazard and knocked the ball past Davis before tumbling to the ground. The Brazilian did, however, play an integral part in Torres's goal soon after. The substitute received the ball on the left and struck a deflected cross that looped over Davis and on to the foot of his left-hand post, rebounding to Torres who finished with his head. It was 2-0 11 minutes later as Oscar cut inside and fed Willian on the edge of the box to shoot low into the bottom corner. Oscar put the seal on an emphatic second half in the closing stages by firing low past Davis following a looping pass from Hazard. Mauricio Pochettino said: \"In the first hour we were playing quite well. We were quite unlucky with the first goal. When Chelsea brought on Willian and Oscar that completely changed the match."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
