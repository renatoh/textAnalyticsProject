But it turns out to be far more than a conceptual joke, digging deep into and expanding upon the (often inadvertent) aural weirdness of its source material. The results pitch beautifully crafted, poignant songs and heartfelt vocals against foggy, ethereal production. Vernon in particular is on shiver-inducing form on The Gaudy Side of Town, which builds from distorted human beatboxing and amplifier buzz into a quiet storm of early-hours regret. In paying homage, Gayngs have mapped out a sonic space entirely of their own, strange and murky and utterly alluring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
