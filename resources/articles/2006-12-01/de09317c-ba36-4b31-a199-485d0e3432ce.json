But both have played a significant role in boosting literacy rates among British soldiers. Up to half of the British army's soldier recruits enter training with literacy or numeracy skills at or below the level expected of a primary school leaver. The army has a large and expanding adult education operation, and a range of initiatives are in place to help recruits grapple with \"the three Rs\". Candahar Barracks in Tidworth, Wiltshire, is home to the UK's largest army education centre. At the barracks library, Major Ed Flute, a tall, enthusiastic man in charge of education, says: \"I don't care what they're reading as long as they read.\" Several of McNab's books are prominently displayed and are frequently borrowed. Even more popular is Jordan's autobiography. Between them they have helped to engender a love of reading among soldiers, some of whom had never read a book before they joined the army. There's a flurry of activity at the barracks today because McNab (not, alas, accompanied by Jordan) is due to arrive in the next half-hour. He will talk about his own lowly, semi-literate beginnings and how the army improved his reading, writing and numeracy skills. His aim is to inspire and exhort a hall full of soldiers to improve their basic literacy skills and to take pleasure from reading. The army has provided education facilities of one kind or another for many years, but in 2001 there was a big shake-up of provision. According to Brigadier Tony Brister, the army's director of educational and training services, the army faces many challenges as a result of the basic skills deficiencies among some of its soldiers. Boosting literacy and numeracy rates not only benefits the individuals but also improves the general effectiveness of the army, he says. \"Facing basic skills deficiencies head-on and effectively leads to more confident, responsive and thinking individuals - individuals who are better prepared to meet the many and varied demands of modern-day soldiering.\" There are 33 army education centres and more than 120 ICT-based learning centres in the UK and overseas. Between 2003 and 2006, around 12,000 learners have studied on 24,000 basic skills courses through the Army Learning Centre (ALC) network, which offers ICT-based learning. Course completion rates are around 84% and pass rates for those taking level 1 (equivalent to GCSE grades D-G) and level 2 (equivalent to GCSE grades A-C) are between 87% and 97%. The army's aim is for all recruits to have literacy and numeracy qualifications by the time they reach the end of their three-year training. These qualifications are needed for those who apply for promotion. Around 55% of new recruits enter the army with level 1 or level 2 qualifications. Around 45% have the average skills of an 11-year-old and around 9% the skills of a five-, six- or seven-year-old. With more than 10,000 new recruits a year, the 9% at the lower end of the educational ability spectrum is a significant number. The army now carries out an educational test at recruiting stage and those who have the skills of a five- or six-year-old are no longer accepted into the army but are referred to local colleges, where they can be helped to improve their educational ability. Once they attain the educational level of a seven-year-old they can reapply to the army. A system of soldier mentors has been implemented to support recruits who are studying basic skills courses. At Candahar there are five classrooms with interactive whiteboards. Class sizes are the envy of state schools, with a maximum of 16 pupils in each and sometimes no more than four students, all taught by qualified teachers. Partnerships with local colleges supplement the provision on offer, and those wanting to take GCSEs have to do them at college. However, a history GCSE is on offer for the first time, and Flute hopes that in time other core GCSEs will be available, too. Colleges that run courses in partnership with the army tailor their provision to the needs of soldiers. Day-release courses are of little practical use when soldiers are away for six months at a time, so instead college courses are offered to them in one-week blocks. There is no limit on the amount of learning a soldier can sign up for as long as it fits in with operational requirements. On a tour of the educational facilities, Flute says proudly: \"This is the only military building where we encourage people to come and snoop around.\" The army is keen for soldiers to continue their education when out on operations. There is an education centre in Basra, in Iraq, and next year one will be established in Afghanistan. There is often \"down time\" when soldiers are on operations, and so they are a captive audience when it comes to studying. Marc Evans, 26, is one soldier who has blossomed. He has been in the army for nine years and says he left school having done badly in his GCSEs. \"I didn't appreciate school at all when I was there. But the teaching here is very different to how it was at school. There was a lot of pressure at school to get the right answer, but there isn't that kind of thing here.\" Richard Farrant, 42, has been a soldier for almost 22 years. He says that in recent years army education facilities have improved enormously. \"At school I spent a year playing truant. At the time, I thought that was a clever thing to do, but later I realised what I'd missed and I suffered for it. Now I understand that education is the way forward.\" As the soldiers return to their classrooms, McNab arrives. As a regular visitor to army education centres to give talks, he knows the drill. He doesn't allow himself to be photographed from the front because he says it could put other soldiers at risk - soldiers with whom he was on undercover operations in Northern Ireland. McNab knows that his own childhood educational experience will chime with at least some of the soldiers. \"I hated school,\" he says. \"That smell of boiled cabbage and floor polish. There was no incentive to learn. I was placed in the remedial class. We often had supply teachers, so we could get away with a lot. All I wanted to do was leave school and start earning money.\" Back in the classroom During a two-month stint at a young offenders' institution for breaking and entering, he was recruited into the army. He had no idea that once there he would find himself back in the classroom. \"I didn't know the army had any educational provision. My army teacher there told me I wasn't thick, that things were going to change and that the only reason I couldn't read was because I didn't read. \" His reading age on entering the army was below that of an 11-year-old, but the army proved to be a transformative experience for him. As well as being a prolific writer now, he is also a keen reader, catching up on the classics such as Dickens, which he missed out on when he was younger. Flute will be involved in setting up the new education unit for British soldiers in Afghanistan. He hopes that more and more soldiers will discover a love of learning and realise the benefits for the advancement of their career and for any employment they want to take up when they leave the army. \"The vast majority of army recruits have not had a positive educational experience at school. What makes me happiest is when soldiers say: 'You treated us like adults, with respect.'\" Andy McNab's latest book, Recoil, is published by Bantam Press at \u00a317.99.
