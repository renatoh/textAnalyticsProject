Serena Williams and Kim Clijsters, two former champions who were due to meet in a contest judged by many to be worthy of the women's final, will now face each other in their semi-final later today with the winner playing either Yanina Wickmayer or the No9 seed Caroline Wozniacki, two 19-year-olds playing in their first grand slam semi-final. However, the scheduling of the men's competition proved far trickier after the unfinished quarter-final between the No3 seed Rafael Nadal and Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez. It would be unprecedented in a grand slam event for a player to be asked to play twice in the same day when their opponent was being asked to play only once. The Spaniard and the Chilean, who are tied at one-set all, will resume their match today, while the other players still left in the men's side of the tournament \u2013 Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro \u2013 had a second day off. Tournament officials have now scheduled the men's semi-finals for tomorrow, with the final being played on Monday. Similarly bad weather in New York last year meant that Federer and Andy Murray contested the men's final on Monday afternoon \u2013 a match won easily by the Swiss world No1, albeit in an atmosphere that was slightly more muted than usual for the US Open. Not that Federer, who will be playing in his 22nd successive grand slam semi-final and is trying to win his sixth successive US Open, was complaining about that. Still, his experience a year ago did prompt him at the start of this year's event to wonder aloud about the folly of playing the tournament in a venue without a roof. \"Those are just things that are unpredictable and with a roof you can make it more predictable for fans, sponsors, television and for players. You know, that's why it's a good thing to have. That's why I'm obviously for it. I think especially, you know, in America we have so many wonderful stadiums, I mean, you figure it's kind of normal that they would be taking the lead with something like this,'' he said. Murray, too, was bemused by the fact the US Tennis Association was reduced to drying the Flushing Courts with dry towels after it rains. \"I've seen a few times since I've been here when it's rained they have like 100 people out on the court with towels sort of cleaning them, drying them,'' he said, laughing. \"I think they could do with investing in some covers.\" Still, it could be worse. A few years ago the USTA considered a plan to dry the courts using industrial strength microwaves only to abandon the idea after it emerged that those doing the drying would be required to use radiation suits."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
