Okocha has signed a two-year deal and it was widely felt that his arrival would mean the end of Djorkaeff's short stay at the club. However Allardyce said: \"We will probably talk to Youri in the next week or two on whether he is going to return. \"Sorting out Jay Jay has been one of the biggest focuses of the last few days. \"Everything else had to be put to one side to get this first crucial signing for the new season.\" Djorkaeff, who won a World Cup winners' medal for France in 1998, joined the club at the turn of the year after being released by Kaiserslautern. The move was good for both him and Bolton. He was recalled to the national side and Allardyce's team escaped relegation. The Bolton manager has made some shrewd signings - and Okocha is probably the biggest considering the length of his deal. Allardyce said: \"Jay Jay's standing and his record are phenomenal. He says he's used to pressure and of course it will be upon him at Bolton. \"He is a top quality player and he wants to produce his skills in the Premiership. \"Jay Jay will be the main man and he knows he will have to produce right from the start. \"The move has come at a good time for him. After a long hard season and the World Cup he now knows where he is going and he is settled.\" Allardyce plans to add another four players before the close of the new transfer windows at the end of August. \"Ideally I would like to get them in before the start of the season,\" he said. \"Crucially transfer windows are now in place and my squad will be full up by August 31. \"There will no more transfer dealings until January 1. That is an awful long time before you are able to bring players in.\" Okocha was Paris St Germain's record signing when he arrived from Fenerbahce for \u00a310m in 1998. He first made his name in Germany for Eintracht Frankfurt between 1992 and 1996. Okocha said: \"My Nigerian colleagues gave me a good impression of the Premiership and I am glad to be here. \"But I am not thinking about myself. I am thinking about what we can achieve as a team. \"I am very impressed with the club and the manager. They are ambitious and he is a nice man.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
