That's what Apple has been doing with its Power Mac G4 range, which it reworked last week. As usual, Apple didn't manage to quote any industry standard benchmarks -- or even a realistic application benchmark -- to back up its hype. However, since Apple users have no choice of hardware supplier, it doesn't really matter -- they have to take what they can get. Multiprocessing may be very old news in the Unix market, and even Windows users have had it since 1993, but no doubt you can expect glowing reviews in the US papers that shill for Apple products."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
