Puzzles, perfume and new types of play have all been deployed to keep the more curious residents engaged and happy. More than 700 people have become infected with coronavirus in New Zealand and the country is one week into a month-long shutdown, meaning no one can leave the house except to get necessities such as food, medicine or to take brief bouts of exercise. Meanwhile, in the nation\u2019s zoos, the most intelligent and social animals \u2013 including gorillas, kea, otters and meerkats \u2013 are missing their human friends. Nathan Hawke, from Orana wildlife park near Christchurch in the South Island, said zookeepers had observed that many of their rare and endangered animals were missing the attention of humans , and continued to show up for their daily \u201cmeet the public\u201d appointments \u2013 despite there being no public to watch them any more. Orana is home to more than 400 animals. Keepers were making an effort to be in certain parts of the park at set times, to minimise the disruption to animals who could become confused if their routine of \u201cmeeting the public\u201d was abruptly halted. The rhinos keep turning up for their 3.15pm appearances \u2013 when they usually get a belly rub \u2013 while the giraffes have remained punctual for their noon and 3pm commitments. \u201cPeople provide a great real-life stimulation for the animals, some of our very social animals, such as kea, are thinking something odd is up,\u201d Hawke said. Zookeepers have been forced to work twice as hard to stimulate and entertain the animals, including taking llamas for long walks, spraying cologne and perfume in hiding places to intrigue the lions, and offering puzzle feeders or playing unusual sounds to keep the keas on their toes. Many of the companion and farmyard animals have also been moved to different parts of the park, Hawke said, allowing them a new area to graze, fresh sights and new neighbours with whom to negotiate relations. \u201cThe kea and gorillas particularly seem to be missing people, they really enjoy seeing the public. So [lockdown] is forcing us to think outside the square and go above and beyond for our precious animals,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cIt\u2019s about maintaining a new normal and filling the gap that the visitors would otherwise fill.\u201d At Wellington zoo in the North Island, animal care manager Joanne Thomas said curious animals such as otters and meerkats were keenly aware of the absence of visitors, and dingos had been taken to visit other zoo animals to keep them busy. \u201cWe do believe it is as engaging for the animals as it is for the visitors when the two interact,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cOtters for example can be very interactive with our visitors. Now we are seeing them focus much more on the keepers than they usually do.\u201d Under the country\u2019s level 4 restrictions, zookeepers are classed as an essential service, and allowed to continue working."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
