She\u2019s still Donald\u2019s fig leaf", "bodyText": "The spectacle of Melania Trump at the Nato celebrations, inside an outfit that looked half papal, half gobstopper, was not the neatest fit with older, possibly inaccurate perceptions of pallid misery and a mutinous resolve to reserve a separate identity from the old goat she, however inexplicably, married. Consider the handholding. Previously, she was widely admired for a very relatable reluctance to touch Trump \u2013 witnessed in the celebrated Tel Aviv hand-swat. Last week, the couple handheld, practically snuggling their way round the summit, or as much as a gigantic poncho ever allows. At an event that exposed, to the largest of audiences, Donald Trump\u2019s more comical deficiencies, his alleged victim appeared all loyalty. Stockholm syndrome? Or could Mrs Trump, hardly a feminist icon from the start, have long been the object of spurious concern, sympathy, wishful thinking? In the absence of fellow partners and any recorded interest in Nato\u2019s strategic goals, it was not clear why Melania attended the event, let alone in a hi-vis cape, never removed indoors, which would get an average person followed around a department store by teams of detectives. Crusading? Nursing? Could we have a quick look underneath there, madam? There was definitely room for medical supplies. Maybe doctors had, wisely as it turned out, recommended some sort of rapid response unit for any Trumpian crisis that might be triggered by international, specifically Canadian, disrespect: \u201cGet your cape, Melania, we\u2019re leaving.\u201d How much more painfully humiliating, if he\u2019d ended lumbering home alone, only Donald knows. Without doubt, the garment signified something. Or other. In a new book, Free, Melania: The Unauthorized Biography, the CNN reporter Kate Bennett dwells on her subject\u2019s use of fashion \u201cas a messaging tool\u201d. After the \u201cpussy-grabbing\u201d tape, for instance, Melania appeared in a pink pussy bow. After the Stormy Daniels revelations, she wore \u201ca bright white Christian Dior pantsuit with matching white button-down shirt\u201d. Bennett translates: \u201cWhatever she was trying to say with that suit, and she was trying to say something, it had a message, and the message was nothing to do with supporting Trump.\u201d Maybe it was in Slovenian. Some of the more mysterious things about Mrs Trump \u2013 that she rarely smiles, endures serial humiliation by the lifelong pussy-grabber \u2013 can be attributed to Melania\u2019s heritage: \u201cIf you understand Slovenians, you know they are not a grinning country.\u201d Same with divorce: \u201cShe was, like most women in Slovenia, not only raised a Catholic but also trained to take the bad with the good, even if the bad was really, really bad.\u201d Such endurance has not previously been tested, obviously, on Slovenians married to orange narcissists who sentence countless Kurds to death. But misunderstandings are inevitable when a person combines clothes messaging with being, as Bennett also decides, \u201cthe most enigmatic first lady in modern history\u201d. Even the infamous \u201cI really don\u2019t care, do u?\u201d Zara parka that the first lady modelled at a Texan border camp was not, in Bennett\u2019s analysis, a message to an incredulous world, but to her step-daughter Ivanka (because Ivanka shops at Zara). It meant: stop taking credit for stopping the separation of migrant families. \u201cThere are no coincidences with Melania Trump.\u201d This is by no means the most counterproductive anecdote in a book committed to showing that Melania\u2019s is an impressive, independent identity \u2013 hence the title\u2019s comma \u2013 but with little other than her proximity to Trump to work with. Though she likes gold stuff and flowers. Enough to make her \u201cone of the few creatives who has ever been first lady\u201d. Anything else? She is \u201cuncommonly beautiful\u201d. \u201cLuminous\u201d. \u201cHypnotic\u201d. One need hardly add that the barge she sat in, like a burnish\u2019d throne, burned on the water. To return to Bennett, (who surely, on the book\u2019s evidence, deserves a role as the Washington Cleopatra\u2019s handmaiden or, better still, press secretary): \u201cThen there\u2019s the way she smells. She has a distinct, noticeable fragrance, even to those who generally don\u2019t notice such things.\u201d Her voice? \u201cNeither too high nor too low.\u201d Her \u201csignature\u201d wave? \u201cFar more comfortable for putting others at ease than, say, Hillary Clinton\u2019s perfunctory side-to-side wave or Michelle Obama\u2019s full-forearm windshield wiper.\u201d Supposing the hagiography does dispel, as it should, lingering suspicions of victimhood, the corollary must surely be a new, less forgiving acknowledgment that Melania, performing in public as shagger\u2019s lustrous helpmeet, is complicit in her country\u2019s disgrace. Bennett confirms that Melania broadly agrees with her husband\u2019s politics and urged him to run. But, as with Carrie Symonds in the UK, Melania, allegedly condescended to by feminists, has in reality benefited from a feminist impulse to respect women as independent of their partners. Since Melania chooses, however, not only to busy herself with table landscapes but with staged proofs of allegiance, so as to advance the proposition that Trump is not, regardless of the evidence, the embodiment of cruelty and sexism, it is unclear that feminist principles should help with the detoxifying. Leave that to his latest press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, recommended by both Melania (her previous charge) and by the heavily indebted Bennett. Melania, according to Grisham, is \u201cvery funny\u201d. She uses emojis. Endorsing these endorsements, the PR herself is praised for having served journalists \u201cwarm chocolate chip cookies and milk\u201d. As much, then, as this glowing account owes to a White House official (the one currently savaging Nancy Pelosi and Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan), it confirms what must be obvious to anyone fluent in cape-language: Melania Trump is as valuable to the political interests of her husband, the sexual predator, as Symonds, the animal lover and Tory campaigner, is to selling her own incontinently lying partner\u2019s #getbrexitdone project. It really would be condescending, considering the women\u2019s strenuous promotional work, not to believe them implicated in its consequences. \u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
