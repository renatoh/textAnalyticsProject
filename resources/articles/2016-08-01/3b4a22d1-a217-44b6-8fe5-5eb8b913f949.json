Pushed down into the dirt on her knees, with her face twisted in both anguish and rage, the woman bites down on the finger of a policeman who tries to restrain her, and grabs at another infant with her left hand. A boy sits in the red desert over a still body, with so much pain in his face you want to turn away. There\u2019s a nun behind them, standing ready to cover the naked baby in a white cloth as it\u2019s torn away. Titled Tribal Abduction, the winner of the 33rd Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards (NATSIAAs) is a striking choice \u2013 large in scale, deeply political and deeply confronting. It hangs with 74 finalists at the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, where it hits home particularly hard: the NT is still reverberating from last week\u2019s Four Corners, and the shocking images and footage of black children being abused in government care. \u201c[The painting] will be confronting for some people but it\u2019s a reality, it is our history, it is our legacy,\u201d says Indigenous curator Kimberley Moulton, a member of the three-person judging panel. \u201cIt\u2019s a trauma that a lot of us still carry.\u201d As the artist Harold Joseph Thomas (Bundoo) says, \u201cIt\u2019s been happening for 200 years ... This keeps going.\u201d Thomas knows well the power an image can hold. A Darwin local, and a descendant of the Luritja and Wambai people of central Australia, he was just 24 and fresh out of art school when he put together the three blocks of colour \u2013 red, yellow and black \u2013 that would become the Australian Aboriginal flag. Originally designed for the land rights movement in 1971, the flag and its colours are now an iconic symbol of Indigenous Australia: flown at the Aboriginal tent embassy in 1972; carried by Cathy Freeman at the 1994 Commonwealth Games; and granted Flag of Australia status the following year. He puts the success of that one striking image down to its simplicity. \u201cIf you want to get an image that portrays a symbol for everybody you can\u2019t use secular objects,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to broaden it, abstract it, and then you\u2019ve got to make it linear and clear. And it\u2019s the metaphor in it, it\u2019s the lyric, the image of the land \u2013 there\u2019s Aboriginal language in that [flag].\u201d But after four decades as an artist, Thomas has become more well known for his landscape and nature paintings. A figurative work drawing from European inspirations including Delacroix, Caravaggio and Degas, Tribal Abduction represents a significant departure. \u201cI\u2019ve decided that now, I must do this,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. He sees this type of work as an artistic challenge. \u201c[Painting the body] is a turning point, about me proving to myself that I\u2019m an artist.\u201d The subject matter of his winning painting is as personal as it is political. Both of Thomas\u2019s parents were removed from their families in the 1920s, and Thomas was seven when he was taken from them, sent to an Anglican institution for Aboriginal boys. Born in a segregated community, his grandmother would sneak in at night to cuddle her grandchildren. \u201cI remember her chewing tobacco, bush tobacco, it has a beautiful aroma \u2013 it\u2019s called pituri. The smoke that was on her, and the lovely smell of her body when she hugged me \u2013 I will remember that all my life.\u201d He remembers his removal too. \u201cIt was awful,\u201d he says. \u201c[The trauma] lasts a long time, but you\u2019ve got to move on. A lot of people don\u2019t. I\u2019ve moved on, because I am able to express it. But I can understand those who haven\u2019t.\u201d The finalists and category winners of the NATSIAAs were selected by a judging panel consisting of Moulton, contemporary Indigenous artist Vernon Ah Kee, and artist and philanthropist Don Whyte. The judges were looking for a multifaceted exhibition of contemporary paintings, 3D work and multimedia, alongside more traditional Indigenous art; a varied collection that\u2019s at odds, the judges say, with the limited way Australia and the wider world perceives Indigenous art. There\u2019s the steel work of Gunybi Ganambarr; the bold shapes and colours of Naomi Hobson; the humour of Vincent Namatjira, who has painted the Queen and Prince Philip attending the exhibition, \u201ca bit nervous and excited at seeing so many great paintings\u201d; the Youth Award-winning multimedia work of Yolngu director Ishmael Marika; and a piece by Nicole Monks, the first performance artist ever selected as a NATSIAA finalist. There\u2019s the field painting of Betty Kuntiwa Pumani, who has won the Work on Paper Award for the fourth consecutive year, with the striking red and white mapping of her native land and its stories. And there\u2019s the European influence of the winner Harold Thomas, who at the ceremony acknowledged that his style often put him at odds with the Aboriginal art world: \u201cEven though my art is very western, the elements of it reflect my place, which is Aboriginal, and the land tells me so.\u201d \u201cAboriginal art is so often relegated to the decorative arts or the primitive, and with good reason: because it\u2019s been consistently described like that for decades,\u201d judge and artist Ah Kee tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI was looking for those pieces that would encourage people to ascribe different descriptors to this show, and to who we are [as Indigenous artists] \u2013 more than just blackfellas in the desert.\u201d Coulton agrees; Aboriginal art is often positioned as either traditional painting about country \u201cwithin the \u2018noble savage\u2019 space\u201d, she says, or as political art. \u201cWe\u2019re siloed in these spaces. It is really limiting, and it\u2019s not a true representation of what we\u2019re doing.\u201d Ah Kee speaks of the Indigenous artists who declare themselves apolitical, too. \u201cYou see that all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt disappoints me, but they are part and parcel of what Aboriginal art is.\u201d Consistently political in his art and in his commentary, Ah Kee has long been outspoken about Indigenous artists who play into what he sees as comfortable, often idealised notions about the life they are living, and the palatable art they should be producing. \u201cI want us all to be politically aware of how we\u2019re positioned in society. We have no choice as Aboriginal people,\u201d he says. \u201cBut a lot of Aboriginal artists, they don\u2019t want to be seen as political, and they go out of their way to declare that. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of reasons for that \u2013 mostly it\u2019s because they want to eat ... [But their art] makes people who spend money on it feel good about themselves, without having to think about the reality of those people\u2019s lives.\u201d The winning painting by Harold Thomas doesn\u2019t come with that option: it\u2019s raw, it\u2019s urgent, and it\u2019s undeniable. And like much of the art on show at the NATSIAAs, it keeps a story alive. \u201cThere are no Aboriginal people who are going to turn up to this exhibition, look at the work, and not know what it\u2019s talking about,\u201d Ah Kee says. \u201cNot everyone will like it \u2013 not many people will like it, actually. It\u2019s a hard subject matter, and the fact that it\u2019s so autobiographical really hits a nerve for the country.\u201d He explains: \u201cWhen whitefellas paint work about themselves, everyone claps them. But when blackfellas do it ...\u201d he trails off. \u201cI\u2019d like to see that work acquired by the National Portrait Gallery, but it won\u2019t be. I\u2019d like to see it acquired by the prime minister and cabinet, but it won\u2019t be. Whereas you get somebody like Brett Whiteley making paintings about Sydney, and he\u2019s called a \u2018quintessential Australian\u2019. Well actually, maybe he\u2019s not the best example of a quintessential Australian. \u201cSelecting [Thomas] as a winner strengthens the award, and adds to its legacy I think. 2016 will be the year that Harold won for this entry. And hats off to him.\u201d 2016\u2019s NATSIAAs will also be remembered as the first year a performance artist won in the 3D category. Nicole Monks is a Sydney-based artist from a mixed Aboriginal, Dutch and English heritage \u2013 \u201cSo: first nations, first people to come on a boat and go, \u2018Hey, there\u2019s a country down there\u2019, and first people to come and colonise it,\u201d she explains. \u201cHow do you live with all those things together? And how does that feel?\u201d In her work We Are All Animals, Monks has married the fur of a sheep with the feathers of an emu to create a new animal that represents her own inner conflict: part native, part introduced species. She wears the costume, dancing and nesting in various surrounds, before removing it, naked and exhausted. Wherever you end up, you have to make a home, she says \u2013 but it\u2019s not always easy. Monks discovered her Indigenous heritage only nine years ago, after hunting down the paperwork that proved the ancestry of her grandmother: a pale-skinned member of the stolen generations, who grew up in an orphanage. After a life filled with an indefinable tension \u2013 she describes it as one between the head and the heart \u2013 the discovery didn\u2019t come as a shock. \u201cIt was actually a relief. Like, \u2018Oh, thank god. That\u2019s why [I feel like this],\u201d she says. \u201cSo I went back to WA for the first time as an adult, to tell my uncles and cousins and everyone \u2013 these people I\u2019d never met \u2013 that they were Aboriginal too.\u201d She wanted to make a work about what it feels like straddling two worlds. \u201cAll this learnt behaviour in the head \u2013 so, the introduced western species [of the sheep], up the top. And then the native feeling from here,\u201d she gestures to her chest. \u201cWhat I wanted to do was create a whole new animal that embodied those things ... and to show everyone that we are just animals. We\u2019re trying so hard to push ourselves out of that animal kingdom, as though we\u2019re above it somehow. We\u2019re not.\u201d As for the exhibition as a whole, Ah Kee is hesitant to limit it by describing the work \u2013 or the industry it represents \u2013 in any one way. \u201cPeople are just finding their voice,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we\u2019re just heating up.\u201d \u2022 Telstra NATSIAA finalists\u2019 works will be exhibited at the MAGNT from Saturday 6 August until Sunday 30 October, 2016. The Salon des Refus\u00e9s is on at the Charles Darwin University Art Gallery until 30 September; the Darwin Aboriginal Art fair is on until August 7 at the Darwin Convention Centre.
