Lack of knowledge and the cost of using the internet are the over-riding factors in keeping the online population from using electronic financial services, say Datamonitor. The survey said that security is only a major concern for those already using these services. \"When you ask people using the internet what their major concerns are, security always tops the list. Datamonitor's analysis reveals, however, that security concerns do not seem to stop consumers from making the decision to use online financial services in the first instance,\" says Derrick Brown, Datamonitor financial services analyst. \"In fact, people who use online financial services are more concerned with security than the general internet-using population,\" he adds. The analysis of security concerns and use of electronic financial services showed that those who have made the decision to bank online turn out to be more concerned about security than those who do not use electronic financial services. The survey, which covered six European countries as well as America found that consumers in the US and the UK are more concerned with security by comparison to the other countries. This could be as a result of a high degree of media exposure to online security breaches in these countries."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
