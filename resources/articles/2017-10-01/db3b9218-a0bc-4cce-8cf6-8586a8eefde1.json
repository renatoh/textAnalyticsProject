Michael Spurr, the head of Her Majesty\u2019s Prison and Probation service, has said it had been an \u201cincredibly difficult\u201d summer after an unexpected summer surge in prisoner numbers to a record 86,000 prisoners, and further rises forecast to come. \u201cI anticipate that we won\u2019t close any prisons this parliament,\u201d Spurr told the annual conference of the prison governors\u2019 association in Derby on Wednesday. It is now expected that Hindley young offenders\u2019 institution and prison in Wigan, and Rochester jail in Kent, both of which had been earmarked for redevelopment, will now remain open. Home Office plans were also revealed this week to turn the Verne immigration detention centre in Dorset back into use as a prison, reducing its capacity by 20%. Spurr said plans to provide 10,000 extra prison spaces this parliament were still on track, with the 2,100-place HMP Berwyn in Wales opening in phases. Michael Gove made a high profile pledge when he was justice secretary to close \u201cageing and ineffective\u201d Victorian inner city jails. The revival of longterm \u201cnew for old\u201d plans was enshrined in the latest Tory manifesto, which promised to \u201cinvest over \u00a31bn to modernise the prison estate, replacing the most dilapidated prisons and creating 10,000 modern prison places\u201d. It now seems likely that manifesto pledge will be abandoned. Spurr said Ministry of Justice officials were \u201cstill trying to understand\u201d the reasons behind the surge in the prison population between May and August this year, when it went up by 1,200. He told the prison governors he had never known the jail population to rise by so much in such a short space of time. \u201cIt did shock us through the summer,\u201d he said. Officials believe the unexpected rise might have involved a number of factors, including major court cases finishing and changes to police bail arrangements. The unforeseen surge in prison numbers was accompanied by a sharp upwards revision of prison population projections. Prisoner numbers are expected to hit 88,000 by March 2022. The former director general of the prison service, Phil Wheatley, told the Guardian in August that the summer surge in numbers was adding to the pressures on a jail system that was \u201calready woefully short of space\u201d and subject to frequent riots that took out cell spaces. He said the rise in jail numbers had \u201cmore or less wiped out\u201d the value of a boost in the number of prison officers and prevented the closure of older jails. Meanwhile, the chief inspector of prisons has revealed that substantial numbers of convicted sex offenders who have been sent to a Yorkshire prison with problems with violence in order to \u201cstabilise it\u201d have not been provided with adequate programmes to challenge their offending. Peter Clarke said that over the course of the past year number of sex offenders held at Doncaster prison had trebled as part of a deliberate policy in order to help to stabilise the prison because of the serious problems with violence. He said that while levels of violence had been reduced they were still too high and came about at the expense of the rehabilitative needs of the sex offenders. The prison service confirmed that decision to increase the number of sex offenders at the Serco-run prison was not national policy but part of a local strategy to improve stability at the jail. A new specific houseblock with a regime for sex offenders had been opened. Probation officers will be able to impose new licence conditions on prisoners leaving jails including bans on alcohol, gambling and access to online content, under changes announced by the prisons minister Sam Gyimah on Thursday. He said those who failed to stick to the tailored restrictions could find themselves recalled to jail."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
