Texas\u2019s Critical Infrastructure Protection Act went into effect on 1 September, stiffening civil and criminal penalties specifically for protesters who interrupt operations or damage oil and gas pipelines and other energy facilities. Within a couple of weeks, two dozen Greenpeace activists who dangled off a bridge over the Houston ship channel became the first people charged under the new law, which allows for prison sentences of up to 10 years and fines of up to $500,000 for protest groups. The new Texas law is emblematic of the unyielding loyalty of conservative lawmakers to the fossil fuel industry in a state stacked with influential climate science deniers or sceptics such as the US senator and former Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz and which named a pipeline tycoon to its parks and wildlife conservation commission. With kindred spirits in the Trump White House, Texas is now intensifying its support of the fossil fuel industry and, pipeline by pipeline, literally laying the groundwork for production to ramp up even more in the next decade. The scale of new production is \u201cstaggering\u201d, according to an analysis by Global Witness, a campaign group, with Texas leading the way as US output of oil and gas is forecast to rise by 25% over the next decade. This makes it a \u201clooming carbon timebomb\u201d, the group believes, in a period when global oil and gas production needs to drop by 40% to mitigate the worst impacts of the climate crisis. \u201cThe sheer scale of this new production dwarfs that of every other country in the world and would spell disaster for the world\u2019s ambitions to curb climate change,\u201d the report states. The US is already the planet\u2019s leading producer of oil and gas and central to its rise is the Permian Basin, a shale region of about 75,000 sq miles extending from west Texas into New Mexico. Despite the oil price crash of 2014, the Permian\u2019s oil production has soared from about a million barrels a day in 2011 to about 4.5m this autumn, while natural gas production has trebled since 2013, according to US government figures. In March, the Permian overtook Saudi Arabia\u2019s Ghawar to become the world\u2019s most productive oilfield. While Saudi Arabia\u2019s overall production remains far higher, predictions that the Permian\u2019s output will continue to grow at a similar rate \u2013 doubling by 2023 as pipeline capacity expands and major oil companies increase their presence \u2013 are alarming environmentalists. \u201cHaving some kind of wild west boom going on in Texas where it\u2019s every man for himself drilling as quickly as possible and trying to pull the stuff out of the ground in a kind of frenzy, that\u2019s just the precise opposite to what should be going on,\u201d said Lorne Stockman, a senior research analyst at Oil Change International, a clean energy advocacy group. While there are some indicators of a slowdown in the growth rate, Chevron\u2019s president of North American exploration and production, Steve Green, told an industry event in October that the oil major sees a \u201cboom boom boom kind of economy\u201d with a \u201clong, healthy pace of activity in the Permian and Texas for decades to come\u201d, Bloomberg reported. The Permian\u2019s fortunes are not dependent on the whims of one or two dominant companies \u2013 there are hundreds of operators, from tiny independents to huge multinationals such as Chevron, ExxonMobil, BP, Shell and ConocoPhillips, many of the corporations which, as the Guardian has reported, are behind a large proportion of the planet\u2019s carbon emissions and are poised to flood markets with an additional 7m barrels per day over the next decade. Gene Collins has witnessed firsthand the flipside of the Permian\u2019s economic boom. The 68-year-old, who runs an insurance agency and is on the board of a local economic development corporation, was born and raised in Odessa, a city which, with neighbouring Midland, is at the heart of the Permian. Heavy trucks are damaging road surfaces, traffic accidents have increased and housing rates have soared, he claimed. \u201cIt has not been a gradual growth. It\u2019s been the type of growth that puts such a strain on the community that we\u2019re unable to keep up with what we need to handle the crowds, the influx. Our housing shortage is really epidemic. It puts a burden on our school districts. We need teachers but we can\u2019t bring teachers in because we have no place for them to stay,\u201d Collins said. A report last May by the Environmental Integrity Project, a not-for-profit group, cited a lack of air quality monitoring in west Texas, with only one station to track sulphur dioxide levels, and limited regulatory oversight which relies on companies to self-report unauthorised emissions. The pace of drilling, low prices and lack of capacity have led to the Permian\u2019s frackers producing more natural gas than the infrastructure system can handle, prompting them to vent gas or deliberately burn it off in an environmentally harmful process known as flaring. \u201cWe probably have some of the worst air that we\u2019ve ever had out here in west Texas\u201d Collins said. \u201cEvery night we flare out here, let off natural gas, a lot of it really fugitive emissions because we don\u2019t have the regulators out here.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Texas Oil and Gas Association, a trade group, did not respond to a request for comment on how the industry plans to improve air quality in the Permian. Its president, Todd Staples, has said that its members \u201care accomplishing emissions progress through voluntary programmes, innovations and efficiencies\u201d. New pipelines should help relieve the bottlenecks, such as the Gulf Coast Express, a 448-mile pipeline which went online in September to take natural gas from west Texas towards the state\u2019s portion of the Gulf coast. But these too come at an environmental cost. In the Rio Grande valley, at the border with Mexico, activists are battling to stop the construction of three planned liquefied natural gas processing and export facilities at the port of Brownsville. \u201cWe\u2019re facing a massive wave of fossil fuel facilities that we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d said Rebekah Hinojosa, a local organiser with the Sierra Club, a national environmental group. \u201cThe lifeblood of those communities is nature, ecotourism, shrimping, fishing, dolphin watch tours. Having a massive fossil fuel industry is not compatible.\u201d Though Texas is also the national leader in wind power capacity, the fracking investment locks the state into a fossil fuel future and enables the US to export cheap gas to other countries, perpetuating worldwide demand. Democrats in Texas are pinning their hopes on long-term demographic shifts that point to the state becoming a political battleground within the next decade, potentially paving the way for more climate-conscious policies such as restrictions on fossil fuel production, tougher regulatory regimes and promotion of renewables. \u201cWill Texas have a political shift that might empower Democrats at some stage who might be more willing to think about restraining the growth of the oil sector, if not reversing it?\u201d said Joshua Busby, an associate professor of public affairs at the University of Texas at Austin and senior research fellow at the Center for Climate and Security. Busby believes natural disasters might accelerate change by altering the economic equation. The Gulf coast\u2019s vulnerability to storms potentially made more severe by global heating \u2013 such as Harvey, which flooded much of the Houston area in 2017 - could damage ports, refineries and petrochemical plants, erode financial markets\u2019 enthusiasm for fossil fuel investments, hurt companies\u2019 bottom lines and push climate concerns higher up the priority list for voters in traditionally conservative suburban and rural areas. Collins doubts that a radical transformation is imminent. \u201cWe have climate change deniers running the government. So there\u2019s really no benefit to them [in restricting drilling] if they think that the energy that is produced outweighs the risk,\u201d he said. The new measure punishing protesters, he said, underlines the political priorities in Texas: \u201cFor them to pass a law like that gives you an indication of what they think about the oil industry versus the rights and the health of human beings.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
