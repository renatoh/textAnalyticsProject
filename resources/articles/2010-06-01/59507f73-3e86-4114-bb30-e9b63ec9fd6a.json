The standoff began at around 4pm, when police were told that a man brandishing a sawn-off shotgun entered a branch of Barclays bank in Ashford, on the western edge of London. A Surrey police force helicopter hovered over the building, which is not far from Heathrow airport, while armed officers and hostage negotiators were called in. As many as 16 people were trapped inside. Shortly after 7pm, a line of people emerged from the bank with their hands up. Officers ordered them to kneel on the ground as they were checked to determine whether they were hostages or robbers. Some of the hostages were wearing white boiler suits which the gunman had ordered them to put on. He was also said to have asked them to use spray paint to cover the windows from the inside. Police cars were parked close to the bank, and nearby roads sealed off. Witnesses said one of the men who came out of the bank had a gun put in his face by officers. It is believed this was the suspect who was arrested. Dan Beedell, 31, a youth pastor who lives locally, told how he became a hostage after visiting the bank. The gunman entered the bank wearing a white boilersuit and dust mask, shouting \"Everyone get down on the floor\", Beedell said. The man asked whether anyone had a heart condition and \"some people\" then left the bank. Beedell said: \"He started shouting at people. He threw a lot of boilersuits out so we would look like him. \"I managed to get half of my boilersuit over my head. He came up behind me and put the gun back to my head and said 'Put it on'. The most bizarre thing was that it suddenly seemed to fit. \"Then he wanted money and was obviously threatening people.\" He added: \"Although we were scared the bank manager was incredibly calm, the staff were incredibly calm and I guess I was calm as well. When he had the gun at the back of my head, I wasn't panicking, I wasn't thinking I'm going to die.\" The sound of police helicopters was audible within 10 minutes of the gunman entering the bank, he said. The man was \"clicking the gun every 20 to 25 seconds. \"I guess that's possibly why I didn't feel quite so scared. I just couldn't work out where those cartridges in this gun were going.\" At one point the man offered the hostages cigarettes and alcohol because he wanted them to be \"calm and relaxed\" but he could not find his lighter. Neil Wood, the owner of Ashford Glass, which is about 150 metres from the Barclays branch, said the released hostages had come out with their hands tied behind their backs. Presumably they had been tied up by the raider. Jaspal Singh, from nearby Feltham, was working at software company opposite the bank. He said: \"First a large gentlemen came out of the bank and started talking to police and he was taken away in handcuffs. \"About 4.16pm, two women ran out and went over to an armed policeman with their arms in the air, and he told them to run back away. \"Then, at just before 5pm, eight men and women came out of the bank and ran across the road. One man was barefoot and his hands were cable-tied. Another woman, smartly dressed, also has her hands tied. We could hear the police commander asking for authorisation to go into the bank at one point.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
