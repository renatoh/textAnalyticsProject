Neville won eight Premier League titles, two Champions Leagues, three FA Cups, two League Cups, the Intercontinental Cup and Club World Cup, while playing 85 times for England and featuring at five tournaments. Yet he views the 2-1 extra-time victory over Arsenal at Villa Park as his most exhilarating match. The semi-final is remembered for Ryan Giggs\u2019s superb individual winner but also featured Roy Keane being sent off, a pitch invasion and Peter Schmeichel saving a Dennis Bergkamp penalty. United again meet Arsenal in the competition in Friday\u2019s fourth-round tie at the Emirates. \u201cIt was the best game of football I have ever played in and I think all of us say the same thing,\u201d Neville said, referring to Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and his brother Phil. \u201cThe penalty save, Keane\u2019s sending off, 10 men, a pitch invasion, Ryan\u2019s goal.\u201d United went on to win the Cup and, after claiming the Champions League and Premier League, sealed a historic treble. \u201cIt was a magical week because we beat Juventus [in the Champions League semi-final] the week after,\u201d Neville said. \u201cIt was the only time in a match where I ever smiled when I was playing \u2013 the only time I have done that in a pressure moment as it was enjoyable as well as exciting. \u201cPeter Schmeichel had done his thigh in so I was taking the goalkicks. I walked towards the fans to take one and smiled, thinking: \u2018This is unbelievable this.\u2019 You know when you just feel: \u2018This is something special.\u2019\u201d Even the dying-seconds win over Bayern Munich in the Champions League final the following month ranks behind it. \u201cIt did top the Bayern game, because we didn\u2019t play well in that game. It typified what Man United is.\u201d Of the Giggs strike Neville said: \u201cWhen it went in and I was just screaming. I always remember Phil giving the penalty away and me thinking: \u2018Oh my God, not you.\u2019 Then Schmeichel saves it and you think: \u2018Wow\u2019. Even Beckham\u2019s [opening] goal was a good goal. \u201cI always remember after the game we were being carried off the pitch but Tony Adams and Lee Dixon [Arsenal players] were standing outside our changing rooms to shake our hands \u2013 that is the one big thing that stands out for me. \u201cI remember thinking: \u2018Bloody hell, they are proper guys these two, so well done to them to do that.\u2019 Because remember they had won the Double the year before and we were still neck and neck in the league at that point.\u201d Giggs said of his goal: \u201cWhen I got the ball my feeling was that I was having a bit of a nightmare. I had come on for Jesper [Blomqvist] and I kept giving the ball away. So I took the decision that the next time I got the ball I was going to have a little dribble, so that\u2019s what I did and before you knew it, it was in the back of the net. \u201cTo be honest, I realised it was a good goal, and when leaving the ground a few reporters grabbed me and said: \u2018Is that the best goal you have ever scored?\u2019 And I thought: \u2018I think have scored a few better.\u2019 \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I got back and watched it back that I realised I had beaten that many men. It was pure adrenaline \u2013 beating players really and not thinking too much about it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
