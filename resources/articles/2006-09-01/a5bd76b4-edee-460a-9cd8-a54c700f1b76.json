You'll find more of that blatant honesty on Back to Black, Winehouse's exceptional, Fifties-styled second album. Candid tales of her cheating, drinking and loving are entwined in wonderfully direct retro soul, jazz and doo-wop beats, from Salaam Remi and Mark Ronson. Look out for 'Me and Mr Jones', her tribute to rapper Nas (wife Kelis should probably be warned) where she proves no other chanteuse can deliver the word 'fuckery' so eloquently. Starkly autobiographical, this is one of the best albums of the year and even better than her debut, Frank. EJS She says: 'It's an exorcism. I get all my stuff out there ... Life is funny and sad.'

The Long Blondes Someone to Drive You Home Rough Trade, 6 Nov Until April, they were the Best Unsigned Band in Britain. Then Rough Trade went and spoiled it all by drafting them a record contract. Now the Sheffield quintet are releasing a debut album, and it delivers a rush every bit as ecstatic as their early singles. Blondie is the nearest point of reference to their brand of icy, edgy, guitar-fuelled pop, and glam frontwoman Kate Jackson would be in no way fazed by the comparison. Listen to 'Giddy Stratospheres ' and you'll hear why. They'll be fi lling indie dancefloors all winter. KF They say: 'We've got what it takes to be a classic British pop band.' Buy this if you like: We are the Pipettes by The Pipettes. Scissor Sisters Ta-Dah Polydor, 18 Sept Last time around they paid homage to Elton John. A couple of million sales of their debut album later, the Scissor Sisters are co-writing with Dame Elton (on their comeback hit 'I Don't Feel Like Dancin ') and experiencing dream visitations from Paul McCartney. Ta-Dah isn't quite as unselfconscious as the Sisters' debut but fans of the fivesome's retro disco pomp will not be disappointed, and 'Might Tell You Tonight ' is a love song that tempers their worst excesses. KE Singer Jake Shears says: 'Elton's had a bad influence on us in terms of jewellery stores.' Buy this if you like: Leo Sayer, The Bee Gees. Tom Waits Orphans Anti, 20 Nov A triple CD set featuring 54 songs from Waits's vaults including 30 that have never been heard before, Orphans covers everything from rockabilly stomps to broken-down ballads, subterranean rumbas to mutated cover versions. Grouped generically by CD, the album comprises Brawlers, a collection of full-throated blues-based rockers; Bawlers , a jumble of seasick ballads, off-kilter waltzes and woozy love songs; and Bastards, a blend of avant-garde instrumentals and spoken-word interludes. Threaded through each album are the various songs and sound pieces that Waits has recorded for films, stage plays and other odd projects, such as Hal Willner's album of Disney covers. 'Heigh Ho', a song made famous by seven Disney dwarves, is a highlight, grotesque and scary, while his nightmarish 'Poor Little Lamb' should not be played in the presence of nervous children. Or adults for that matter. S'OH He says: 'Orphans are rough and tender tunes. They grew up hard ... They don't bite, they just need attention.'

The Killers Sam's Town Mercury, 2 Oct Back with worrying beards, but as fixated on their Las Vegas hometown as they've ever been, tight-trousered glam rockers the Killers return with the anthemic follow-up to their multimillion- selling 2004 debut, Hot Fuss. Singer Brandon Flowers is still only 25, the little git, and yet his boomy, operatic voice gives an inspired sense of drama to their new single and album highlight 'When You Were Young'. While the single sleeve is such an obvious nod to U2's The Joshua Tree - scrubby desert, serious facial hair, the suggestion of brain-melting heat - the album's cover goes more for a Swingers-style silver bullet Winnebago look. It screams, quite wonderfully, of we're-the-biggest-band-in-the-world arrogance. It's clear that the Killers have also been listening to plenty of Bruce Springsteen - aptly, considering they spent mere weeks paddling in the fishpond of indie acclaim before diving rapidly and successfully into the pop mainstream - and believe themselves to be similarly stadium-bound. You'll get choruses so big you could put them on Broadway, lyrics memorable enough to yodel on the bus home from Wembley and an album infused with an unstinting, peculiarly American belief that humankind can fly to the stars on the power of rock music alone. LH They say: 'It's the greatest album of the last 20 years.' Buy this if you like: Eyes Open by Snow Patrol. Joanna Newsom Ys Drag City, 14 Nov Harpist Joanna Newsom's second album - pronounced 'Ees' - is extraordinary, an instant (pre)modern classic. Named after a mythical, flooded Breton city, it follows her cult hit, 2004's The Milk-Eyed Mender. A glance at the support personnel involved is enough to make you spill your mead. Brian Wilson's lieutenant Van Dyke Parks did the stark string arrangements over a period of eight months. Cantankerous analogue producer Steve Albini (Nirvana) recorded it. Experimental guru Jim O'Rourke mixed it. Most jaw-dropping of all is Newsom herself, a fearless original. She wields a harp (as she did on her debut) and a poetic menagerie of animals, meteors, fear and joy. Marimbas and horse skulls flesh out the harp, vocals and strings on these five long tracks; her creepy boyfriend Bill Callahan (Smog) chips in with backing vocals. Newsom's eccentric child-witch delivery has been tempered somewhat since her debut but remains unmistakable; her dense, storytelling lyrics faintly recall Patti Smith's surging poetry, in texture if not in vocabulary. With weird folk and neo-medievalism all the rage in arty circles, Newsom has decisively outclassed all comers on one of the albums of the year. KE She says: 'I wanted it to feel like the orchestra was hanging in a hallucinatory shape around the more substantial harp and voice.' Buy this if you like: Vespertine by Bjork. Jarvis Cocker Title tbc Rough Trade, Nov Sheffield's second-sharpest wit (Richard Hawley has pipped him in recent years) returns to something approaching a high profile with his first solo album, rumoured to be called Warrior on the Edge Time. Since Pulp went on an indefinite hiatus three years ago, he hasn't exactly been dormant, but neither has he courted public attention with his former eagerness. He wrote songs for the soundtrack to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and collaborated with Charlotte Gainsbourg. None of this high-art swanning, however, has dulled his vicious hatred of privileged sorts: the first track he's released from the album is an otherwise stately ballad called 'Running the World', which has a chorus that points the C-word in the direction of politicians, big business and the silly rock stars who consort with them. He says: 'I apologise for all the swearing but sometimes that's the only thing that seems appropriate.' Buy this if you like: Hot Chip's The Warning. Lupe Fiasco Food &amp; Liquor Atlantic, 25 Sep First heard on Kanye West's 'Touch the Sky' single, fellow Chicagoan Lupe Fiasco (real name: Wasalu Muhammad Jaco) finally releases his long-delayed debut in late September. Heralded by a terrific single, 'Kick Push', a warm and funny song about love and skateboarding, Food &amp; Liquor showcases the rapper's tuneful, non-gangsta stance. Indeed, 'Hurt Me Soul' is a broadside against hip hop's excesses and other modern ills, delivered with affection and impeccable catchiness. The album is executive produced by Jay-Z, and Kanye West figures too. He says: 'The \"food\" is the good part, and the \"liquor\" is the bad part; I try to balance out both parts of me.' Buy this if you like: Late Registration by Kanye West. The Who Endless Wire Universal, 30 Oct The last time the Who released a studio album of new material, it was 1982. So anticipation for Endless Wire, the band's 11th studio album and the first without late bassist John Entwistle, is somewhat keen. The album remains closely guarded at the time of going to press, but a taster for the full 19 tracks was released earlier this summer. 'Wire &amp; Glass', a long, raw single, forms part of a mini-rock opera at the heart of the album; 'Mirror Door', a typically Who-sian pomp punk track, got radio airplay last June. According to feverish internet speculation, some of Endless Wire was inspired by the Beslan school massacre. Guitarist Pete Townshend's novella The Boy Who Heard Music also provides source material, and the opening track, 'Fragments', was composed on software designed especially for Townshend and singer Roger Daltrey. KE Pete Townshend says (on his blog): 'Against all the odds ... in my own jaundiced middle-age, rock is not dead. Neither is it right. Or wrong. Or a new religion. Or an answer. Or even a question. It's a process ... The kids in my imaginary band The Glass Household in \"Wire &amp; Glass\" describe the process as breathing, exploding, imploding, climbing a stairway to a door made from a mirror, and walking through, expecting oblivion in a black hole, instead finding a slow after-show party.'

Beck The Information Interscope, 2 Oct The last album Nigel Godrich produced for Beck was 2002's Sea Change, a reflective, feet-up-on-the-table kind of record. This time around, on Beck's ninth album proper, the 'Beckrich' pairing is more feet-to-the-floor, ears vigorously flapping. The Information is full of the Los Angeleno's perky genre-munching; Godrich's trademark glaze is applied liberally on top. Beck's sense of fun has returned: recent live gigs featured puppet doppelgangers performing alongside his band. On the album, stickers are provided so you can design your own sleeve; there's a disc of videos appended. At the end author Dave Eggers and director Spike Jonze talk spaceships. The album itself starts off with considerable vim, too: 'Cellphone's Dead' and 'Think I'm in Love' deliver tip-top boho rap and pop mooning respectively. 'Nausea' finds the usually serene Scientologist uncharacteristically engaged, with a nagging tune But The Information gets a little muddled the further in you go. The title 'Horrible Fanfare/Landslide/Exoskeleton' is a good indicator of the sprawling jam lurking within. KE He says: 'Nigel said he wanted to do a hip-hop record. And in a way it is, in a way it isn't. It has hip-hop songs.'
