The 25-year deal, agreed under the government's private finance initiative, covers 1.4 million people and 775,000 tonnes of waste a year, and is due to be finalised in the next few days. Global Renewables, a Manchester-based subsidiary of the Australian engineering group GRD Ltd, plans to invest \u00a3340m to build two waste facilities in partnership with Bovis Lendlease. About \u00a390m comes from PFI credits, with the main funding coming from five banks, including Bank of Ireland and Lloyds TSB. The company intends to look at other UK waste contracts up for renewal in the next 18 months. It is also considering listing on the London stock market next year. David Singh, development director at Global Renewables, said the company's system substantially reduces the amount of household waste going to landfill sites - which produce greenhouse gases - and avoids the need to incinerate waste. \"Globally, we can't continue to plunder the world's resources and then bury the refuse on our doorstep,\" said Mr Singh. The process, which has been used in Sydney, involves an integrated mechanical system that sorts recyclable materials such as plastics, metals and glass, and also turns about 70% of the remaining black-bag household waste to compost. \"The idea is to rescue plastic, paper, glass and other recyclables. Then with the organic matter, to use it to produce biogas - a renewable energy source - and turn the rest into compost to be reapplied to the land.\" The company claims it will deal with enough rubbish to fill Old Trafford 86 times over the 25 years, and reckons 100,000 trees will be planted a year using its organic compost. It consulted Friends of the Earth while planning. \"This is the first PFI waste project to meet all the legal environmental requirements in advance,\" said Mr Singh. \"The thing that enabled us to win the project in a competitive market is the low environmental footprint. There are some companies trying similar approaches, especially in Europe, but this is new to the UK.\" The company plans to build one facility on an old British Leyland site near Preston and the other at a former ICI plant at Thornton. Between them, they are expected to employ about 380 people. The contract is a fixed-price deal, with GRD building, owning and operating the facilities, then transferring ownership to the council after 25 years. \"We make a margin during the construction and also from operating the facilities,\" said Mr Singh. \"We are looking at other country-wide waste management contracts going out to tender over the next 18 months and we expect to bid for some of these.\" GRD came to the waste business from a mining background, once it realised its expertise in extraction equipment could be used in other areas. \"We started to look at waste about 10 years ago, and decided with our mechanical expertise we could build machines to sort waste,\" Mr Singh said. \"We spent a number of years studying different technologies and saw a lot of advanced systems in Europe for sorting and recovering waste, but no one had brought them together in an integrated facility. \"We looked at systems for extracting gas out of organic matter, to use for supplying electricity, as well as composting machinery. Two or three pieces of technology were ahead of the others so we licensed those, and then we developed the sorting systems.\" The first plant in Sydney has been running for two years under a commercial contract. \"It has been very successful in competing with landfill projects,\" said Mr Singh. \"But we didn't see Australia developing as a big market in the short term so we came to the UK, since the European Union has been pushing for increased recycling and reduction of greenhouse gases, and the UK has responded.\" In Australia, the company has had the reduction in greenhouse emissions due to its plants certified and thus sells carbon credits to other businesses. These include BP, which can then sell its premium fuel in Australia as environmentally friendly. Backstory Britain is working hard to reduce the amount of waste going into landfill sites. In England and Wales, for example, the aim is to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste dumped in landfill sites to 35% of the 1995 level by 2020. Local authorities are being assigned the level of biodegradable waste they can send to landfill sites and face fines of up to \u00a3150 a tonne for excess - though there is a scheme that allows them to trade landfill permits. The government has also set targets for recovery from municipal waste through recycling and composting. It is seeking to recover 67% by value of municipal waste by 2015. \"Waste in the UK is still growing faster than GDP. Legislation is increasing waste recovery but reducing waste disposal to landfill,\" analysts at HSBC noted in a recent research report on the prospects of some of the UK's leading waste-disposal companies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
