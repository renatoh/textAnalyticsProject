Please do not add spoilers from later episodes. I know some of you found the idealised scenes of domestic contentment a bit twee last week. Not me; I\u2019m made of marshmallows and kitten-receptors. But for those who did, I hope you enjoyed this week\u2019s antidote: the debauched scenes set in Jezebels, the members club for sexually incontinent commanders and the special stash of contraband prostitutes they\u2019re keeping from whoever it is that really runs this regime. Everybody rebels, even those who appear to be in charge, because the set of rules held up by the republic are impossible to live by. Back in Nick\u2019s bedroom Offred tells us, flatly, \u201cI\u2019m here because it feels good and because I don\u2019t want to be alone\u201d. We guessed that, didn\u2019t we? This is just the first in a run of dialogue ball-drops during an episode where characters spell out their motives, breaking with the subtlety of the rest of the series. Perhaps the change of writer heralds a shift in tone. So far, I don\u2019t like it. Nick and June\u2019s relationship has warmth and genuine affection now, making Offred\u2019s assignations with the Commander all the more chilling. Joseph Fiennes notches his performance up to creep-factor 10 as Fred paws his handmaid in the slutty gold dress he\u2019s picked out for her. And as with recent episodes, we glimpse another backstory here, this time Nick\u2019s. He\u2019s the son of a drunk, broke father who has to keep the money coming in. I suppose that\u2019s better than no backstory. The older man from the labour exchange who takes him for coffee tells him about a \u201cgroup\u201d (the Sons of Jacob) who want to \u201cclean up\u201d the world and make it a better place. Nick is effectively fished when he\u2019s down on his luck \u2013 a common cult recruitment technique. But how much is he colluding with them, and how much is he dependent on them? This week, he seems to suggest he is kept in his place by fear of ending up on the wall. He\u2019s a guardian, but perhaps not a willing one. While Mrs Waterford tends to her mother, the Commander sees his chance for some alone time with his handmaid. The scene where he shaves Offred\u2019s legs has me almost physically hugging myself with discomfort. \u201cHe\u2019s good at this. He\u2019s done it before,\u201d thinks Offred. I shudder. \u201cYou look stunning,\u201d he says as she awkwardly walks down the stairs in the tony gold dress and he reaches for her hair, letting it down in a \u201cWhy Miss Offred, you\u2019re gorgeous\u201d moment of cliche that is equally cringe-worthy. Nick\u2019s flashbacks also include a back-of-car scene between Fred and other unnamed Commanders as they casually come up with the mechanics and name for the Ceremony. This also felt madly clunky and nowhere near as seamless as exposition in previous episodes. Back at Jezebels, to the sound of White Rabbit by Jefferson Airplane, Offred descends into the rabbit-hole with Fred, finding at the bottom a bordello with half-naked girls draped over suited men on velvet banquettes. It is louche but smart, a gentlemen\u2019s club with heavy tumblers of whisky and furtive-looking old buffers following half-dressed women to who knows where. Offred looks entirely uncomfortable, but when in Rome \u2026 she orders a Manhattan. If she has to endure this, it should be drunk and on good liquor. Her reunion with Moira is joyful and then disappointing, as she finds her former cheerleader \u2013 the one she refers to when she feels like giving up (what would Moira do?) \u2013 has become resigned to her fate. \u201cFix your face, girl. You\u2019re a mess,\u201d Moira tells her like a woman who knows when the game is up. June is visibly crestfallen. Poor Nick is forced to watch as his \u2013 what are we calling June? His girlfriend? \u2013 is marched off to the elevator with Fred, knowing there are only hotel rooms above. He even gently rejects the advances of the Martha in the kitchen who, presumably, used to pay for the drugs he brings her with a bit of light sexual relief behind the butcher\u2019s block. Nick\u2019s got it bad. Having endured Fred\u2019s creepy seduction and her disappointment at Moira\u2019s defeat, Offred is taken back to the Waterford home by a despondent Nick. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll get you home before you turn into a pumpkin,\u201d says Fred as he shepherds her back to the car. He finds himself so charming and amusing doesn\u2019t he? On the next sunlit morning, Serena returns from her mother\u2019s, all piety and beatific smiles, little knowing the Sodom and Gomorrah that Nick, Offred and Fred have returned from. Or maybe she does. She turns a blind eye to so much, why not that? Nick and June\u2019s showdown in the kitchen is charged with tension, and he breaks it with a blunted statement about not doing this any more. One minute he\u2019s kissing her where anyone might see, the next he\u2019s throwing a tantrum because she\u2019s obeyed their Commander and betrayed him. Nick is one confused young man. The present of Serena\u2019s childhood music box is the tin lid on it for me this week. \u201cThe perfect gift,\u201d says Offred bitterly to herself. \u201cA girl trapped in a box.\u201d \u201cI will not be that girl in the box,\u201d she says defiantly. Clunk bang wallop. This is not the adaptation I know and love, and this has been my least favourite episode of the series. I hope it regains its original tone next week. Blessed be the fruit. May the Lord open. Under his eye \u2022 When Fred suggests to Offred that they do \u201csomething different\u201d she replies with a hopeful but not entirely unsarcastic \u201cMonopoly?\u201d She wishes. \u2022 \u201cTonight, you aren\u2019t you,\u201d Fred tells Offred as they reach the Boston border with an irony that seems to completely escape him. \u2022 When we see the fate of the previous Offred, the ambulance comes to take her watched by Serena and Fred. She hisses in his ear, \u201cWhat did you think was going to happen?\u201d But she went along with this lunacy! She can\u2019t blame it all on the men. \u2022 Our Offred\u2019s boldness is increasing as she scrapes You Are Not Alone into the woodwork under the Latin phrase scratched by her predecessor. \u2022 After last week\u2019s revelation that June and Luke now know of each other\u2019s continued existence, I\u2019m surprised she doesn\u2019t mention him once this week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
