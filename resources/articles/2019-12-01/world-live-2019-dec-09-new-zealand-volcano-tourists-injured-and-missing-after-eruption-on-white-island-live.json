Police have said that they believe there are no survivors left on the island after reconnaissance flights showed \u201cno signs of life had been seen at any point\u201d. The military will deploy drones at first light to assess the situation on the ground. As many as 27 people were thought to have been stranded on the island after the eruption. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern arrived in Whakatane, the nearest major town, late on Monday night and met with local council leaders. She is expected to travel to the island on Tuesday. New Zealand police deputy commissioner John Timms told a briefing that police and rescue crews have still not been able to access to the island, after advice from volcano experts. \u201cThe physical environment is unsafe for us to return to the island.\u201d. A number of people have been taken to hospital, some with burns as a result of the eruption. Fewer than 50 people were on the island at the time of the eruption, and 23 have been taken off. 30 to 38 of those people were passengers on the cruise ship Ovation of the Seas, as confirmed by the chief executive of the New Zealand Cruise Association. The eruption occurred about 2.11pm local time, 48km off the coast of the Bay of Plenty, in the North Island. Academics have questioned the suitability of White Island, New Zealand\u2019s most active cone volcano, as a tourist destination, saying it \u201cwas a disaster waiting to happen\u201d. New Zealand Red Cross has activated the Family Links website for those concerned that their loved ones may have been caught up in the incident. We are going to pause our live coverage for now. Thanks for reading. Our latest news wrap is here. Some academics have been questioning the wisdom in allowing White Island to be a tourism destination. Raymond Cas, emeritus professor at Monash University\u2019s school of earth, atmosphere and environment, told the Australian Science Media Centre that he always felt it was too dangerous. \u201cWhite Island has been a disaster waiting to happen for many years. Having visited it twice, I have always felt that it was too dangerous to allow the daily tour groups that visit the uninhabited island volcano by boat and helicopter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has a very active geothermal system with many steaming gas vents and varying numbers of hot water filled crater lakes in the floor of an amphitheater-shaped large crater.\u201d Associate professor Derek Wyman, a geoscientist at Sydney University, said he was surprised tourists were allowed so close to the site, given its recent history. \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t be recommending tourists be approaching a site that has recently been throwing material up 30 metres into the air,\u201d he told SBS News. The eruption was \u201crelatively minor\u201d, Professor Wyman said. \u201cNew Zealand sees things like this quite frequently. \u201cUsually people don\u2019t die from these kinds of eruptions, but that is likely because they are not usually inappropriately close.\u201d New Zealand police said early on Tuesday morning local time that they did not believe there were any survivors on White Island following Monday\u2019s eruption. Just after midnight, officers said in a statement that after reconnaissance flights over the island, \u201cno signs of life had been seen at any point\u201d. \u201cPolice believe that anyone who could have been taken from the island alive was rescued at the time of the evacuation,\u201d a statement said. \u201cBased on the information we have, we do not believe there are any survivors on the island.\u201d Officers are \u201curgently\u201d working to confirm the exact number of those who have died, in addition to the five already known to be dead. They had earlier said as many as 27 people had been stranded on the island after the eruption. The military will deploy drones at first light to assess the situation. The New Zealand Herald reports that Jacinda Ardern has arrived in Whakat\u0101ne, and that she is currently in a meeting with members of the district council: \u201cThe prime minister is currently in a meeting at the Whakatane District Council. The Crown car is waiting outside with a number of taxis. Waiariki MP Tamati Coffey\u2019s car is also outside, as are police, regional council and St John vehicles.\u201d A post by Twitter user @Maori1 appears to show Ardern arriving there: More information is emerging about the geology that underpins White Island and about the raising of the alert level in recent weeks. Prof Bill McGuire, emeritus professor of geophysical and climate hazards at University College London, said it was \u201ca sporadically active volcanic island very similar to Stromboli volcano in the Mediterranean. It does not have major eruptions, but small blasts of ash, blocks and lava are reasonably common. \u201cBecause the island is only a couple of kilometres across, however, visitors are close to the vent and under threat even if there is a small explosion. The volcano has been restless for a few weeks, resulting in the raising of the alert level, so that this eruption is not really a surprise.\u201d Dr Jessica Johnson, lecturer in geophysics at the University of East Anglia, said the eruption was \u201cunfortunate but not completely unexpected\u201d, pointing out that \u201clevels of activity ... have been relatively high since September, and even more elevated over the last couple of weeks, with increased numbers of small earthquakes and more volcanic gas detected than usual. As a consequence, the volcanic alert level was raised. Similar eruptions have happened over the last 100 years or so. \u201cEven though the alert level was raised, it is still very difficult to forecast exactly what will happen at volcanoes. White Island/Whakaari is an andesitic stratovolcano, which means that it can have lots of different types of eruptions. It also has a water-filled crater lake. When water reacts with hot rock or magma, it can create explosions, and therefore, can make eruptions even more difficult to forecast.\u201d She said it was difficult to say whether there would be more eruptions. \u201cWhite Island/Whakaari is a very beautiful and interesting destination that naturally attracts tourism,\u201d Dr Johnson added. \u201cIt is very difficult to say whether tourism should be allowed there. The volcano has displayed similar unrest in the past with no major eruptions. The most that the scientists can do is continue to monitor the volcano and issue information when it is available.\u201d This is the full statement released by New Zealand police after the earlier news briefing. It provides details for the Family Links website which allows family members and friends concerned about loved ones to register an inquiry: Police can confirm five people are now confirmed to have died in the White Island volcanic eruption. Our sincere condolences are with their family and friends. We are continuing to work as quickly as possible, through a number of channels of information, to confirm exact numbers of those involved, including those who remain on the island. A number of people have been injured and taken to Whak\u0101tane hospital and Middlemore hospital [in Auckland]. Both New Zealanders and overseas tourists are believed to be involved. Police are currently taking advice from GeoNet experts, who have advised that due to the current risk environment, emergency services remain unable to access the island. We are reassessing as information and advice is received, however police will not be in a position to access the island tonight. The police 105 number can be used by members of the public to submit information regarding friends or family who might have been visiting White Island during the eruption. People from overseas can call +64 9105 105. People can also use the online form at the police website here. At the request of New Zealand Police, New Zealand Red Cross has activated the Family Links website for people wanting to register themselves as safe or register an inquiry about a loved one. If you are worried about a friend or family member following the White Island eruption, first contact them as you normally would. If you cannot make contact, you can register them through this website. Please note this website does not host an official list of missing persons, and information is submitted by members of the public. A no-fly zone is in place at 5 nautical miles around White Island. Police will continue to provide updates as information becomes available. Charlotte Graham-McLay in Wellington has written an account of the deadly events on White Island: It was a beautiful, clear day in Whak\u0101tane, a town on the east coast of New Zealand\u2019s North Island, the air fresh with the beginning of summer. Suddenly and silently, just after lunch, a massive plume of smoke spewed into the blue sky. Just off the volcanic White Island, or Whakaari, a boatload of tourists who had been standing at the crater just 20 minutes earlier watched in surprise, and then horror. \u201cIt was kind of hard to tell at first, because we\u2019d seen the smoke before, but this was a huge cloud of it,\u201d said Michael Schade, who was visiting the island with his parents. \u201cWe were taking photos and videos and then it dawned on us what had happened.\u201d The full scale of the disaster on New Zealand\u2019s most active cone volcano is not yet known: five people have been confirmed dead and up to two dozen remain unaccounted for. More deaths are likely, police have said. Passengers on the Ovation of the Seas cruise ship have been told they are not allowed to leave the vessel, and it will remain in dock in Tauranga until further notice. Sylvain Plasse, a Canadian tourist on board, said he had seen the volcano erupt from land and thought he had been lucky to glimpse such a rare sight. But when he returned to the ship and heard that passengers and crew members were missing, \u201cjoy and excitement turned into horror\u201d, he said. \u201cThe mood became sombre on the ship,\u201d said Plasse. \u201cEveryone\u2019s trying to carry on and have a great time but it\u2019s in the back of your mind, it hits your stomach.\u201d Five people have been confirmed killed, a figure that is expected to rise, after a volcanic eruption on New Zealand\u2019s Whakaari/White Island. A double-digit number of people remain on the island, according to deputy commissioner John Timms of New Zealand police, although the exact number remains unknown. Tims told a briefing that police and rescue crews have still not been able to access the island, after advice from volcano experts. \u201cThe physical environment is unsafe for us to return to the island.\u201d A number of people have been taken to hospital, some with burns as a result of the eruption. Photographs in the aftermath of the eruption appear to show a wrecked helicopter on the island. Fewer than 50 people were on the island at the time of the eruption, and 23 have been taken off. 30 to 38 of those people were passengers on the cruise ship Ovation of the Seas, as confirmed by the chief executive of the New Zealand Cruise Association. The eruption occurred about 2:11pm local time, 48km off the coast of the Bay of Plenty, in the North Island. Whakaari / White Island is New Zealand\u2019s most active cone volcano, and is a popular tourist destination and scientific research site. It last experienced a short-lived eruption in 2016. Tims also confirms that \u201ca number\u201d of those on the island were from the Ovation of the Seas cruise ship, but would not confirm their nationalities. Earlier, Guardian Australia confirmed there were 30-38 people from Ovation of the Seas on the island. Guardian Australia also confirmed there were more than 20 Australians. But it is unknown how many were also cruise ship patrons. Now to questions. Deputy commissioner Tims is asked if \u201cat least a double digit number of people remain on the island.\u201d He confirms this but cannot be more specific on numbers. When asked how far police are from the island, Tims says \u201cwe are on the shore\u201d. New Zealand police have just confirmed there are five people who have died. Deputy commissioner John Tims says that police and rescue have still not been able to access to island, after advice from volcano experts. This means police are still unsure how many people remain on the island. \u201cThe physical environment is unsafe for us to return to the island,\u201d he says \u201cA number of other people have been taken to hospital. A number of people have burns as a result of the eruption. It is still too early for police to confirm how many people are involved...including how many are still on the island.\u201d There will be another briefing from NZ authorities in 15 minutes. More than 20 Australians were on Whakaari/White Island, as part of a tour group, when it erupted, Guardian Australia can confirm. Their condition is unknown, and it is unclear how many were rescued, and how many remain on the island currently. New Zealand Police said fewer than 50 people, in total, were on the island when it erupted. 23 have since been taken to shore. But it is currently too dangerous for police and rescue to visit the island, and up to 27 people remain. Prime minister Scott Morrison also earlier confirmed that \u201cAustralians have been caught up in this terrible event\u201d. Our updated news story is here: Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, has offered emergency support to New Zealand and Jacinda Ardern. He also confirms Australians have been \u201ccaught up in\u201d the eruption. \u201cA terrible tragedy is unfolding in NZ after the volcano eruption on Whakaari/White Island,\u201d he says. \u201cAustralians have been caught up in this terrible event and we are working to determine their wellbeing. \u201cI have been in touch with Jacinda Ardern to offer our full support with whatever they need and our authorities are working closely together. I will be staying in direct contact as events continue to unfold.\u201d The damaged helicopter shown in footage of White Island belongs to Volcanic Air, a tour company based in Rotorua. The pilot and four passengers were unharmed and returned to the mainland via boat on Monday afternoon, a company spokesman said. \u201cVolcanic Air has confirmed it had a helicopter on Whakaari/White Island at the time it erupted this afternoon,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cFive people had flown to the island in the helicopter, but all are accounted for and have arrived back in Whakatane by boat. The company has enacted its emergency response plan and says its priority was looking after the pilot and passengers.\u201d Volcanic Air has been running charter tours to White Island since 1992. Ross Dawson is a director of Adventure Helicopters in Tauranga. One of his pilots flew over the western end of the island with a convoy of media on board soon after the eruption. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t see much from the air apart from a lot of steam and volcanic ash,\u201d Dawson told The Guardian. The pilot\u2019s summary was that it was \u201cnot good.\u201d Aviation authorities have since implemented a 26 nautical mile no fly zone around the island to help rescue crews. White Island is 22 nautical miles offshore. The island last erupted in 2016, according to the New Zealand science agency GeoNet, in a \u201cshort-lived\u201d burst that happened in the evening and did not injure anyone. Explosive eruptions, followed by bursts of ash, happened in 2012 and 2013. In its longest episode, White Island erupted from December 1975 to September 2000. A sulphur mining venture began on the island in 1885, according to GeoNet, but this was stopped abruptly in 1914 when a landslide destroyed the sulphur mine and miners\u2019 village. 12 people died. Now, a visit to the miners\u2019 buildings are part of a daily tour on the island, to the island, which is a popular attraction in a sunny, beachfront region attracts tourists, especially in the summer. 10,000 tourists a year visit the island, which is a popular tourist attraction in a region famed for its beaches and sunlight hours. Professor Richard Arculus, a volcanologist from the Australian National University, says White Island had been \u201cshowing signs of unrest for the past few weeks\u201d. \u201cThe eruption this afternoon was a short-lived explosive event. In addition to gases, fragmented rock particles (ash) rose ~4000m above the vent\u201d. Some more photos from the scene \u2013 showing tour operators rescuing people roughly 15 minutes after the eruption. One person has been killed, and that figure is expected to rise, after a volcanic eruption on New Zealand\u2019s Whakaari / White Island. Up to 27 people are still unaccounted for and the island is too dangerous for police and rescue to access. Police deputy commissioner John Tims said there \u201care likely to be more\u201d casualties. Fewer than 50 people were on the island at the time of the eruption, and 23 have been taken off. 30 to 38 of those people were passengers on the cruise ship Ovation of the Seas, as confirmed by the CEO of the New Zealand Cruise Association. Seven people, of the 23 taken off the island, are critically injured. The eruption occurred about 2:11pm local time, 48km off the coast of the Bay of Plenty, on the north island. Whakaari / White Island is New Zealand\u2019s most active cone volcano, and is a popular tourist destination and scientific research site. It last experienced a short-lived eruption in 2016. Owner of Ovation of the Seas, Royal Caribbean, has said the ship will stay in port overnight. \u201cWe can confirm that a number of our guests were touring the island today,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe do not have any additional details to share at this time. \u201cOvation of the Seas will remain overnight until we learn more about the situation. We will offer all possible assistance to our guests and local authorities. Please keep all those affected in your prayers.\u201d A still from one of the videos of the island shows a helicopter after the eruption. Former prime minister Helen Clark has shared her condolences. Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs says it is making \u201curgent enquiries\u201d to find out if any Australians were affected by the eruption. However, it does not have any information to share at present. Breaking from Eleanor Ainge Roy: Kevin O\u2019Sullivan, the chief executive officer of the New Zealand Cruise Association confirmed that a tour party of 30 to 38 people from cruise ship Ovation of the Seas were on a tour of White Island today, and had not returned. He said the passengers names and nationalities were now being handed to police, and the Ovation of the Seas would stay docked in Tauranga at least overnight. \u201cI know the cruise ship will be able to compile a list of the tour party and they will be handing that to New Zealand police, and the police will then make a statement on the nationalities,\u201d he said. \u201cOur hope of course is they will be recovered unharmed and returned back to the ship.\u201d Earlier, the operations director for St John Ambulance told Radio NZ that seven people \u2013 out of those taken off the island \u2013 were critically injured. Norma Lane confirmed the figures to the Checkpoint program. In that press conference, deputy commissioner Tims said that some of the tourists on the island were from cruise ship Ovation of the Seas. \u201cFrom my understanding, some of the tourists are from a cruise ship so we should have a list of people that left the cruise ship and potentially are on the island. There are ways for us to have that list confirmed.\u201d He was then asked if all the people on the island were from the cruise ship. He says: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe so\u201d. Last question to Ardern and the police. A reporter asks if \u201c27 people could be dead\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a full clarity at this point,\u201d Ardern says. \u201cYou understand why we are loath to get into speculation\u201d. Dr Ken Gledhill from GNS Science is now speaking about the eruption. \u201cIt was not a particularly big eruption,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was almost like a throat-clearing eruption.\u201d He says it is unlikely, but possible, there could be secondary eruptions. \u201cIt showed increased activity for the lsat few weeks, so we raised the alert level. But it looks like mostly, there will be an eruption like this, then a moment of quiescence. \u201cBut we can\u2019t be certain there wont be another eruption in the next 24 hours.\u201d \u2022 This segment was amended on 11 December 2019 to correct the last name of Ken Gledhill, from Glairdhill as an earlier version misspelled it. Tims says it is still too dangerous for police and rescue services to go onto the island \u2013 so they are still unclear how many people remain on the island. 23 people have been taken from the island. There were fewer than 50 people on the island at the time of the eruption. \u201cSome of these people have been transported to shore, however there is a number still remaining on the island who are currently unaccounted for,\u201d Tims said. \u201cWe are working to confirm the numbers involved. At this stage, it is too dangerous for police and rescue services to go to the island. However, we continue to assess the conditions which would allow us togo onto the island. \u201cThe island is currently covered in ash and volcanic material. We are taking expert advice with regards to the safety of any rescue attempt.\u201d Police Deputy Commissioner John Tims has confirmed that one person has died. \u201cAnd based on information we have, there are likely to be more,\u201d he adds. Sarah Stewart-Black, the director of Civil Defence Emergency Management, is speaking now. \u201cWe do not expect this event you have any significant impact for the people on the north island at this time. If the situation changes we will communicate this. \u201cAshfall appears to be confined to the island and they do not expect more than a minor amount of ash to reach East Cape in the coming hours.\u201d Ardern will travel to the island tonight. \u201cIt continues to be an evolving situation. We know there were a number of tourists on or around the island at the time. \u201cThe Ministry of foreign affairs have also stood up their systems to assist with any response required for those further afield.\u201d Jacinda Ardern is speaking now. Tourist Allessandro Kauffmann, who posted one of the first videos of the eruption, says he saw people with \u201cserious burns\u201d. In a tearful Instagram video, Kauffman said he saw people with \u201cextensive burns on their bodies.\u201d \u201cThere were two tours on the volcano,\u201d he said, as translated from Portuguese by the NZ Herald. \u201cOurs was the first. The other one right after. We left the island and wasn\u2019t even five minutes before it erupted. This other tour that arrived after couldn\u2019t leave in time. \u201cSome people have serious burns. We had to stay to help those people who were on the island. The boat from this other tour was covered in ash from the volcano. Very tense talking about this. We just have to hope that all is as well as can be.\u201d According to Te Ara, the enycyclopedia of New Zealand, Whakaari lies at the northern end of the North Island\u2019s \u2018line of fire\u2019 \u2013 a large volcanic plateau which stretches from the Bay of Plenty on the coast, to Mt Ruapehu inland. The line of fire forms part of the wider \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 around the Pacific ocean. From the Encyclopedia of New Zealand: \u201cUnpredictable and fascinating, the Volcanic Plateau is New Zealand\u2019s main area of volcanic activity. In this zone, the Pacific tectonic plate is sinking beneath the Australian Plate. At a certain depth its rocks heat and produce volcanic activity, which erupts at the surface in minor ways (steam vents, mud pools and hot springs), and major ways (volcanic eruptions, collapsing mountains and lake formation).\u201d TVNZ report that one of the rescue helicopters is now tasked \u201cjust with taking blood from Auckland Hospital to Whak\u0101tane hospital\u201d. There will be a police and emergency press conference in half an hour. Some more footage from a tourist on a boat near White Island today Professor Shane Cronin, a volcanologist at the University of Auckland, says that the kind of eruption we saw today can commonly occur with no warning. \u201cSudden, unheralded eruptions from volcanoes such as White Island can be expected at any time,\u201d he said. \u201cMagma is close to the surface, and the heat and gases from this heat the surface and ground waters to form vigorous hydrothermal systems. We know hydrothermal and so-called \u2018phreatic\u2019 eruptions can occur suddenly and with little or no warning because they are driven by the expansion of super-heated water into steam. \u201cThe hazards expected from such events are the violent ejection of hot blocks and ash, and formation of \u2018hurricane-like\u2019 currents of wet ash and coarse particles that radiate from the explosion vent. \u201cThese can be deadly in terms of causing impact trauma, burns and respiratory problems. The eruptions are short-lived, but once one occurs, there are high chances for further, generally smaller ones as the system re-equilibrates.\u201d Video purporting to be from today\u2019s eruption has been uploaded to Instagram by a tourist on a cruise boat. It was originally posted to Instagram, 50 minutes ago, and has now been shared by a variety of other accounts. The Guardian has not yet independently verified the video. Images from Whakat\u0101ne, where ambulances are taking injured people to hospital. The NZ Department of Conservation has confirmed to the NZ Herald that there were no staff on the island today. New Zealand police have just issued a revised figure for the number of people on or near White Island. That number is now fewer than 50. However, a number of people are still unaccounted for, and of those taken to shore, at least one is \u201ccritically injured\u201d. \u201cWhile it was initially believed there were approximately 100 people on or near the island at the time of the eruption, we now believe there were fewer than 50,\u201d police say. \u201cSome of those people have been transported to shore, however a number believed to be on the island are currently unaccounted for. Of those transported to shore, at least one has been critically injured.\u201d Geonet have provided their latest update. Volcanic activity has calmed down, meaning that only \u201ca minor amount\u201d of ash will reach coastal towns and cities. \u201cOur monitoring data shows that there was a short-lived eruption that generated an ash plume to ~12,000ft above the vent,\u201d the science agency has said. \u201cAsh fall appears to be confined to the island and we do not expect more than a minor amount of ash to reach East Cape in the coming hours. \u201cWe have seen a steady decline in activity since the eruption. There remains significant uncertainty as to future changes but currently, there are no signs of escalation.\u201d Seven helicopters have been dispatched to the island by St John Ambulance. A national warning has been issued for the eruption. New Zealand Police are advising people that volcanic ash could pose a major health hazard. Roads have been closed in the town of Whakat\u0101ne, which is the closest to White Island, and the Whakat\u0101ne hospital has been turned into an emergency operation centre. \u201cEffects of a volcanic eruption can be experienced many kilometres from a volcano,\u201d say NZ Police. \u201cBe aware of the potential for ashfall. Consider staying indoors. Volcanic ash could be a health hazard, especially if you suffer from breathing difficulties. When indoors, close all windows and doors to limit the entry of volcanic ash. \u201cIf caught in volcanic ashfalls: Wear a dust mask or use a cloth handkerchief over your nose and mouth; protect your eyes by wearing goggles. Wear eyeglasses, not contact lenses as fine ash will get under the lens.\u201d Whakaari/White Island is New Zealand\u2019s most active cone volcano. It is a popular tourist and scientific research site. According to the science agency GeoNet, today\u2019s eruption was a level four, signifying a \u201cmoderate\u201d volcanic eruption. The scale runs from zero to five. Our most recent full story is live here: Prime minister Jacinda Ardern addressed media earlier, and confirmed that there were 100 people near the island. \u201cPolice were alerted at 2.17pm,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cAt this stage, and please do keep in mind this is an evolving situation, we believe around 100 people were on or around the island at the time and some of those are at this stage unaccounted for. \u201cI want to share this is evolving at this stage, at this stage it does appear to be a very significant issue, particularly the scale of those affected.\u201d Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Whakaari/White Island volcano eruption. There are roughly 100 people potentially affected by the eruption, and an emergency rescue operation is under way. St John Ambulance has told Guardian Australia there are up to 20 people injured. There are still other people currently unaccounted for. The eruption occured at 2.10pm local time \u2013 an hour and a half ago The volcano is 48 km off the Bay of Plenty, on the north island\u2019s east coast."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
