Not only did the match on ITV beat the final episode of series five of Line of Duty, which had 12.1m viewers, but it was also the most-watched sports programme on any channel since the 2018 football World Cup. This year\u2019s best figures had been for the Women\u2019s World Cup semi-final between England and USA (11.8m peak), the Wimbledon men\u2019s final (10.4m) and cricket\u2019s World Cup final (7.8m). At one point 79% of the TV viewing audience across Britain was watching the match \u2013 while the average audience throughout game was 8.9m. And the Rugby Football Union, which governs the sport in England, has told the Guardian it will distribute 10,000 new balls to clubs this week as part of a strategy to help them cope with the expected influx of young people wanting to play the game. Steve Grainger, the RFU\u2019s development officer, said the move was part of a broader plan to ensure the interest the sport has generated during the autumn was not squandered like many believe it was when England lifted their only World Cup 16 years ago. \u201cThere is a view that in 2003 we probably weren\u2019t ready,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd these days if somebody turns up at a club and they don\u2019t get a good welcome, or they\u2019re a nine-year-old kid and don\u2019t get the opportunity to touch a ball, they won\u2019t come back for the second week. \u201cSo over the next couple of weeks our focus is on making sure rugby clubs can cope with the influx of new people and sustain it over time,\u201d he added. \u201cThat comes down to the coaching, equipment and having the opportunity to play. We have invested a significant amount of money since before and after we hosted the tournament in 2015 t o improve facilities, and over this next week we will putting 10,000 balls into rugby clubs.\u201d Grainger also said the RFU would be pushing clubs to become more inclusive to reflect the diversity in the current team, which has players from a wider range of ethnic backgrounds and social classes than in the past. \u201cOver the next 10 years we want to be a visibly more inclusive sport than we are today,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are still largely male dominated and we are still not as representative of the sort of English community as we would want to be or should be. \u201cWe have a lot more diversity in the England team than we have ever had but we want to see that replicated at a local level,\u201d he added. \u201cBig strides have been made the last few years in the number of women and girls playing the game but we want rugby to be seen and recognised as an inclusive sport for all. We\u2019re constantly trying to say to our community rugby clubs that they need to be working really hard to reflect the community in which they are located.\u201d The dangers of the sport were apparent when the England prop Kyle Sinckler \u2013 who was born on a council estate in Tooting \u2013 was taken off two minutes into the final after suffering concussion, and Grainger said the RFU would also be doing more to promote touch rugby as part of promoting the sport as part of a healthy lifestyle for older people. \u201cWe have over 35,000 people playing touch rugby and this is going to be a massive growth area,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have an increasing non-contact rugby offering because we want people to understand that, if you don\u2019t fancy the contact bit, there are still loads of ways to get a ball into your hands.\u201d Many of England\u2019s leading players, including Maro Itoje and Owen Farrell, are also expected to attract significant interest from sponsors in the coming weeks but Richard Ayres, a digital marketing expert whose clients include the Premier League, the NBA and Barcelona FC, has warned the sport and the England players need to grab their moment in the sun \u2013 or miss the boat. \u201cOne crying shame when it came to the London 2012 Olympics was that people and sports often didn\u2019t convert from reach to retaining audiences and gaining greater revenue,\u201d he said. \u201cThe RFU, clubs and players have got to grab the moment. You cannot say, \u2018Oh, well, I\u2019ll wait for a few weeks to do something.\u2019 The timing is crucial because, while the Rugby World Cup was fantastic, in the blink of an eye everybody\u2019s attention can flick somewhere else.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
