In this performance with Mitsuko Uchida as his pianist, he brought to bear on it his characteristic qualities: a highly individual tone, a piercing sense of the pain-racked text and a consistent musicianship. But there were limitations to his approach that made this a less than ideal account. As with his vocalism, Bostridge's physicality on the platform was distinctive. Statuesque in the opening song, he grew more animated as the cycle proceeded, bending this way and that, his head often at an unlikely angle, circling the area in front of Uchida's Steinway with small, pointless steps. While such awkwardness underlined the increasing dysfunctionality of Schubert's psychologically scarred protagonist, it contrasted with singing that stopped short of the kind of full-on engagement that the tenor's limitations in colouristic and dynamic range proved insufficient to embody. Though the top of his voice opened up as the cycle moved into its later stages, early on it had sounded stretched, while the lower notes lacked power and resonance. A keen attention to words occasionally gave way to swallowed consonants. Effective devices such as his blanched-out tone became over-employed mannerisms. Uchida's contribution proved far more consistent. Her tone was impeccably fine, her playing considered in its nuanced expression. Unlike most pianists who specialise in accompanying singers, she was, if anything, shy in coming forward - not quite claiming her rightful share of the limelight in what should be a partnership between equals. But there was much to admire in her understatement in Frozen Tears, her bravado in Courage, and her overall sense of continuity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
