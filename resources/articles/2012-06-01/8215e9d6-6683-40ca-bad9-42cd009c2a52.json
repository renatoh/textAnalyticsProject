These days, he's turned his back on the music business to forge a new career in comedy. Performing under the alias Doc Brown (think Back To The Future), his sets mix slice-of-life observations with slick, laugh-packed raps. Aware of the many bizarre elements of hip-hop culture, he uses his rhymes to skewer the excesses of bling and bad-boy swagger that dog the genre. Smith himself wasn't immune to the trappings of rap success, and tells of how drug-taking and laziness put paid to his promising music career. Fortunately, his compelling fusion of gags and beats looks set to win him a much bigger audience. He'll be performing several short slots at The Cat Laughs festival in Kilkenny before coming to Bristol. The Cat Laughs, various venues, Kilkenny, Sat &amp; Sun; Jongleurs, Bristol, Fri Barry &amp; Stuart: Show And Tell, On tour It's always been an article of faith that magicians never reveal their secrets. In fact, it's commonly held that if a conjuror explains how his tricks work, he risks expulsion from the Magic Circle. Such a fate clearly doesn't bother young Scottish double act Barry and Stuart, stars of BBC1's winter Saturday night hit The Magicians. Their latest live show sees them pulling back the curtain. The first half features their trademark macabre illusions, packed with invention, spectacle and the occasional eruption of blood and guts. The second half reveals how the tricks were done. That might sound like spoiling the fun but really it showcases the duo's extraordinary powers of invention. And if you're the kind of person who struggles to enjoy stage magic because you want to know how it works, then this show will cure all your frustrations.

Don't expect all that much whimsy from this unheralded but hugely talented stand-up but do be prepared for a sustained hour-long explosion of viciousness. An arch misanthrope who's seemingly incapable of taking pleasure in anything (even romantic love and fatherhood), Mullone can't stop himself from analysing every minor source of irritation. It would all be a little unbearable, were each routine not studded with beautifully crafted gags. Somehow, out of the pessimism comes a rich vein of comedy, which \u2013 even if it doesn't seem to cheer Mullone up much \u2013 makes life all the more pleasurable for the rest of us.
