Mr Sarkozy is trying to reassure the more sceptical Mr Brown that Mr Blair and the French will not accept a substantial increase in EU powers at a summit in Brussels next week, convened by the German EU presidency, on how to agree a simplified new treaty. Mr Blair is due to attend the summit without Mr Brown, only five days before he gives way as prime minister on June 27th. Although the chancellor and Mr Blair are united on the main British negotiating positions, there is a perception that Mr Blair may be temperamentally inclined to cut a late-night deal that Mr Brown would then have to defend in the face of Conservative and possibly Liberal Democrat demands for a referendum. Mr Brown is certain in the talks with Mr Sarkozy to insist on opt-outs if the rest of the EU goes ahead with plans to make justice and home affairs subject to majority voting. He is also seeking limits on the number of other areas that might see the end of national vetoes. The chancellor also wants an assurance that any agreement on a charter of fundamental human rights does not extend the remit of the EU's court of justice. There have been rumours of tensions beween Mr Brown and Mr Blair, much-denied, over the British negotiating strategy at the summit, and some European officials in Paris were suggesting yesterday that Mr Sarkozy might be coming to act as a mediator between the two men. Mr Sarkozy held talks with Mr Blair at the G8 summit in Germany last week where he claimed - without giving details - that they had reached a common position on the summit, including the charter of fundamental human rights. Mr Sarkozy's allies insist he understands Mr Brown's determination that no agreement is reached at the summit that could be portrayed as a substantial transfer of powers to Brussels, and so justify the referendum previously promised by Mr Blair on the proposed constitution. The Conservatives are almost bound to insist on a referendum, whatever the outcome of the summit, in an attempt to embarrass Mr Brown at the outset of his premiership. Mr Sarkozy was himself elected last month on a promise to support only a mini-treaty, and wants a quick settlement by October to put through the French parliament without a referendum. Mr Blair also yesterday met the sceptic Czech prime minister, Mirek Topolanek, in Downing Street. The Czech president, Vaclav Klaus, earlier said he believed France and Germany were trying to introduce the rejected EU constitution by stealth. \"Only cosmetic changes have been made and the basic document remains the same,\" he told a Czech paper, Hosposarske Noviny, on Wednesday. After his meeting with the Czechs, Mr Blair acknowledged there would be \"real difficulties\" between some of the countries that will gather in Brussels. With moves to resurrect aspects of the European constitution high up the agenda, he said that he would sign up only to an amended treaty. Mr Brown would probably tolerate a permanent EU president, to be elected for a 2\u00bd-year term as chair of the council of ministers, and possibly a reweighting of votes on the decision-making council that would reduce the British ability to block legislation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
