But on the inside, Beauty Mtimkole's bustling salon is bright and cheerful. The floor is paved with pink and cream tiles and the walls decorated with posters of models. It is on the outside that the peeling white paint reveals patches of rust. When the time comes to lock up, the doors slam shut with a resounding clang. After spending years weathering sun and sea on cargo ships, shipping containers begin a new life in Africa. On a continent adept at recycling the jetsam of the developed world, the second-hand containers are a cheap alternative to bricks and mortar. In Khayelitsha, a black township on the outskirts of Cape Town, there are shipping containers everywhere. The offices of Uzuko Funeral Services are housed in one. So is the Ubuntu health clinic, and the Number One Hair Masterers [sic], and a fast-food takeaway where the metal exterior is splashed with a vivid cartoon of two men tucking into fried chicken. When Ms Mtimkole, who runs her hair business with her sister Zukiswa, went into partnership eight years ago, she decided it was a waste of money to rent a shop for 1,000 rand (\u00a389) a month. Instead she spent 16,000 rand on a container and then rented the ground it stood on for 150 rand a month. \"When you have a shop made of wood, thieves can break in and steal what you have inside,\" said Pascal Lawson, 28, who works at his brother's mobile phone repair shop, Dr Sam's Cell Repairs. \"This, I think, is safe. But it's very hot inside. It's cold in winter and very hot in summer.\" The phone shop has been customised with a big painting of a mobile phone on one side, and the stencilled blue and yellow logo of a popular network on an inside wall. For extra security, a set of burglar-proof bars divides Mr Lawson from his customers. Behind a plywood partition at the rear of the container is the cubbyhole where repairs take place: a sweatbox piled high with mobile phone parts. Because the containers are simple cubes of steel, they are remarkably versatile. They can easily be cut with grinders or blowtorches to take doors, windows or hatches. And because they are identical, designed for stacking on ships or in dockyards, they can be piled up or joined together to make multistorey buildings. The biggest container building in Africa consists of 47 of the steel boxes stacked and linked together to make a three-storey school dormitory in South Africa's Western Cape province. In the centre of Khayelitsha is one of the country's most striking container buildings, a tower shaped like an upside-down T with five containers stacked skywards and three containers making up the base. Halfway up, a hole has been cut in the side for a white cinema screen on to which films are projected in the evenings. At the top there is a billboard advertising a make of brandy, with overhanging lights to light it after dark. On the ground floor is a shop selling the kind of dishes which the containers may have transported; cardboard boxes stamped Made in China are filled with blue and white porcelain bowls. There is a plentiful supply of secondhand containers in South Africa because it is the most developed country on the continent, and a centre for sub-Saharan Africa's container shipping. The boxes are usually sold off after five to 10 years' service at sea. Currently they fetch 7,000 rand for the six-metre version and 8,000 rand for the 12-metre one. Elsewhere in Africa, because many ports lack the heavy machinery needed to lift the containers, the price of the boxes is often included in the cost of the goods being shipped. Recycling the discarded objects of the developed world is widespread in Africa, where many people have abandoned traditional clothes for second-hand ones imported from charity shops in the west. In South Africa shipping containers are not the only products to be adapted for use by the poor. In the townships, the soles of women's sandals are made from compressed chunks of recycled cardboard. And in the manicured boulevards of Cape Town, homeless people can occasionally be spotted dragging giant plastic wheeled trollies filled with their possessions: stolen wheelie bins."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
