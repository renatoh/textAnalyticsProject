Garc\u00eda's triumph by two shots in the rain-delayed event in North Carolina was his first on the US PGA Tour in more than four years. A closing round of 66 \u2013 which included birdies at three of his four final holes \u2013 was sufficient for Garc\u00eda to see off the challenge of Tim Clark and avert the possibility of Spain having no playing representation in a European team since the Ryder Cup moved to its present format. \"It's great,\" Garc\u00eda said after moving up to 17th in the world rankings. \"I kind of did it last year, too, in Germany when I needed to play really, really well to get into the Open, which is my favourite tournament, and I almost won there and then got myself into the Open. Winning is always nice. This means quite a bit.\" Garc\u00eda has played in five previous Ryder Cups and has performed impressively. When the event was last played, at Celtic Manor in 2010, he was a non-playing vice-captain under Colin Montgomerie. His Wyndham success is more notable given he used the services of a local caddie for the week. \"Obviously I won a couple of times last year in Europe but it's been a while here in the United States and it feels great,\" Garc\u00eda added. \"I hit some really good shots and made some nice four- or five-footers when I had to. I'm very happy about the way the week has gone. Sometimes it hurts to hear people not giving enough credit to some of those other wins because they're in Europe. Fortunately, I know how much they mean to me and I know how difficult they are so, you know, they were great and they really helped a lot.\" Garc\u00eda's win means Ian Poulter has been knocked out of a guaranteed Ryder Cup spot a little over a week after tying for third at the US PGA Championship. It remains virtually certain, however, that the Englishman will receive one of two wildcard selections available to the European captain, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal. Those picks will be announced by Olaz\u00e1bal next Monday. Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose, Graeme McDowell, Paul Lawrie, Francesco Molinari, Luke Donald, Lee Westwood, Garc\u00eda and Peter Hanson are now guaranteed nine of Europe's 10 automatic places for the meeting with the United States at Medinah. Garc\u00eda's success, and a tied seventh place at the Wyndham for Nicolas Colsaerts, leaves Martin Kaymer in a vulnerable position. The German currently occupies the last automatic berth in the European standings and unlike Colsaerts, will not feature at this week's Johnnie Walker championship at Gleneagles. That tournament represents the last chance for players to earn Ryder Cup qualifying points. A finish of second place or better for Colsaerts in Scotland would see him leapfrog Kaymer, who has been out of form. England's David Lynn, runner up at the US PGA, and Rafael Cabrera-Bello of Spain could have earned a Ryder Cup debut by winning at Gleneagles but that option has now been removed after Hanson withdrew. There are no longer enough ranking points available for either Lynn or Cabrera-Bello to displace Kaymer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
