Officials did not want to know how bad the situation was at the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) because they did not want to do anything about it, claimed Gordon Pollock QC. The \"Orwellian logic\" behind their attitude was: If I haven't seen what was going on at BCCI, you can't blame me. Mr Pollock was opening a \u00a31bn damages action against the Bank by the liquidators of BCCI, which collapsed in 1991 with debts \u00a310bn. He told Mr Justice Tomlinson the case, alleging \"misfeasance in public office\", was being fought \"in a fairly brutal fashion\". Misfeasance cases were rare, he said, and this one was even rarer because it was brought against \"what was once - and I emphasise once - one of the most revered and respected public institutions in this country\". In a hearing set to last well over a year, Bank officials are accused of \"knowingly or recklessly\" failing properly to supervise the rogue bank's activities. The BoE is legally immune from being sued for negligence, and the liquidators - accountants Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu - are aiming to prove \"bad faith\" on the part of supervisory staff. The liquidators are seeking to add \u00a31bn on behalf of 6,500 UK depositors to the \u00a33.1bn so far recovered for creditors worldwide in the unprecedented lawsuit. BCCI was founded in 1972 by Pakistani financier Agha Hasan Abedi. Backed by Arab sheikhs and, for a time, a major shareholding by Bank of America, he built it into a worldwide operation with 14,000 employees at 400 branches in 73 countries. Incorporated in Luxembourg but based in London, the rapidly expanding BCCI was licensed as a deposit taker, without full banking powers, by the Bank in 1980 - allegedly in the face of dire warnings about its lack of financial prudence. Over the next eight years, evidence emerged of BCCI's links with terrorist organisations, arms shipments to Arab states and Latin American drug cartels. Yet its licence was not withdrawn by the BoE until 1991. Apart from ordinary individual depositors, many from the Asian community, the UK losers included Western Isles Council, which lost \u00a324m, and other local authorities. The Bank's role as supervisor of the banking sector was transferred to the Financial Services Authority in 1997. The Bank says the action is \"not only misconceived, but outrageous\". It says that to accuse 22 supervisory officials and staff of a massive cover-up over 11 years and of deliberately misleading the Bank's governors and others was to compare them with crooks and fraudsters. In any event, there would be no point in trying to cover up something which was bound to emerge eventually when the bank collapsed. But Mr Pollock, in an opening address expected to last two months, said he would seek to prove that officials in the supervisory department ignored their duty to protect BCCI's depositors or simply did not care. Over a considerable period, the BoE \"deliberately ran away from seeking to find out sufficient information about BCCI because it didn't want to be drawn into the role of supervisor\", said Mr Pollock. This was the state of mind of a regulator who knew there was a risk but did not want to know how bad it was because it did not want to do anything. He accused the Bank of misfeasance, stopping short of dishonesty, in its decision to grant BCCI a licence in the first place and its failure to supervise thereafter. The case is expected to last well over a year, with a final legal bill expected to be nearly \u00a3100m, and sensitive bank documents from as far back as the 1970s are set to be aired. Mr Pollock, who has appeared in the past for show business stars such as Sir Elton John, is a top-earning barrister and his fees alone could run to more than \u00a32m. The costs of the case yesterday prompted the former Labour minister Keith Vaz to call on the government to intervene at the eleventh hour and broker a settlement. Mr Vaz, who campaigned on behalf of BCCI creditors and employees, said that, while 70% of the Bank's deposits had been paid back, millions would now be paid to lawyers and accountants instead of creditors. If the Bank lost the case, the taxpayer would pay, he said. If the liquidators lost, the creditors would pay. \"It's not too late to finally end the saga of BCCI,\" he said. \"It's now a carcass which is being fed upon by lawyers and accountants.\" Witnesses to be called by the Bank of England include three of its former governors, Sir Edward George, Robin Leigh-Pemberton (now Lord Kingsdown) and Gordon (now Lord) Richardson, as well as more than 20 people involved in bank supervision. Among the supervisors expected to give evidence are a former departmental head, Peter Cooke, who oversaw banking activity during most of the 1980s, and a former bank executive director, Brian Quinn, the current chairman of Celtic football club. The Bank's role as supervisor was transferred to the Financial Services Authority (FSA) by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, in 1997. Now the FSA and other regulators are watching the case with interest because of its potential to open the floodgates to other claims of financial injustice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
