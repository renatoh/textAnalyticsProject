Strachan, in an attempt to prevent the issue affecting his team before tonight's Carling Cup visit to Bristol City, said of Saturday's incident at St Mary's Stadium: \"It's taboo; there are no questions about it to anyone. I'm not going to say anything about it.\" The Southampton manager's instruction came as the Football Association considered whether to investigate the tunnel-side row. Yesterday the FA was examining reports from the referee Steve Bennett and the match delegate. Blackburn's manager and the Saints coach argued during Southampton's 2-0 victory and clashed again at the end of a game, which was also marred by Andy Cole's red card and an on-pitch brawl. After the final whistle Souness squared up to Rofe and, as Blackburn's manager walked into the tunnel, he shouted and gestured at Rofe as if to invite him to continue the argument. Souness, referring to Rofe, said: \"I don't take kindly to members of opposition staff encouraging the referee to send my players off.\" Yesterday Souness said he would be amazed if he was charged with misconduct. \"I can't see what action the FA can take for me having a shout in the tunnel. That happens all the time. I will be very disappointed if they saw it any other way. There was nothing to break up; it was just shouting.\" Strachan has other worries, with several of his players suffering flu before tonight's tie. The striker Brett Ormerod, who missed Saturday's game with the bug, and the midfielder Paul Telfer, who played despite being ill, are among the doubts. Rotherham, facing a daunting task at Arsenal, are also suffering, through both illness and injury. Carl Robinson and Martin Butler are definitely out, while Ronnie Moore will give his striker Darren Byfield as much time as possible to recover from ankle trouble. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has again said he will use a virtual reserve side in this tournament, with none of the players who started Sunday's 1-1 draw at Charlton set to take part at Highbury tonight. However, Nwankwo Kanu, Edu, Pascal Cygan and Sylvain Wiltord are all in the squad and the Spanish striker Francesc Fabregas - known as \"Cesc\" - may become the youngest player to represent Arsenal in all competitions at 16 years and 177 days. Dave Jones, the Wolves manager, will give some fringe players a chance to impress in the home tie against Burnley. Dean Sturridge, Isaac Okoronkwo and Oleg Luzhny are all expected to start as Jones gives some of Saturday's 4-3 comeback winners a break."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
