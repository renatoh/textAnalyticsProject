The technique is not strictly the same as for bonsai, because the roots have not been pruned The only way to keep grass very short on village greens, cricket pitch and, if you're that way inclined, the garden is to mow it often with a cylinder mower - at least weekly, if not more Chamaecyparis obtusa 'Nana Aurea' is often planted as a dwarf shrub (thuja and chamaecyparis are the best species for tightly clipping). If left unclipped, it would eventually reach 2m Conifers respond well to clipping, but only if it's done little and often. If you cut past the green foliage into the brown wood, they will not grow back At first sight, Bekonscot Model Village seems just a wonderland for kids and a certain type of adult. So what, you may well ask, is this scaled-down version of 30s life doing in the gardening pages? The horticultural interest at this one-and-a-half-acre tourist attraction is what lies between the six model villages: a miniature landscape of farms, fields, woods, lakes and rolling hills planted with more than 3,000 shrubs and trees. Many of the plants are what we know as dwarf conifers, but the name is misleading because, if they'd been left to their own devices, most would be full-sized trees by now. Instead, they have been clipped and trimmed religiously since the village was built in 1929, while Japanese elms, Zelkova serrata and Japanese maples have been \"bonsaied\" and now have shapely trunks and elegant forms. There are, then, lessons and inspiration to be had here for conventional gardeners who have limited space to work with. One shining example is the miniature copy of Hampton Court maze, on which Lonicera nitida 'Baggesons Gold' has been used for the hedging. This is trimmed a number of times a year to keep it truly tiny, and shows how it would clearly make a superb substitute for dwarf box hedging.
