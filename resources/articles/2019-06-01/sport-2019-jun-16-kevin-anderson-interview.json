You need people to speak up.\u201d Anderson, who will continue his comeback at Queen\u2019s Club this week after missing the French Open with an elbow injury, comes alive when discussing matters away from the court. The world No 8 loves what he does for a living but it does not define him. Although Anderson has fond memories of his run at Wimbledon last year when he reached the final after beating Roger Federer from two sets down in the last eight and taking six hours and 36 minutes to overcome John Isner in the second-longest match in grand slam history, he knows there is a world outside tennis. The sport has given Anderson, who faces Britain\u2019s Cameron Norrie in the first round of the Fever-Tree Championships, a platform to air his views and he has backed some important causes as the vice-chair of the ATP players\u2019 council. The 33-year-old has channelled his environmentalism by tackling the use of plastics on the Tour and reveals ambitions to ensure lower\u2011ranked players have affordable access to sports psychologists, while he describes himself as a feminist and has become an ally of the LGBTQ community. It speaks to a campaigning streak in the 6ft 8in power server. \u201cMy wife, Kelsey, and I did our first charity event for two causes last year and we\u2019ll be doing it again,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cThe first was for a local animal shelter in Delray Beach in Florida where we live and where we adopted our dog, Lady Kady, from. \u201cThen we worked with Ocean Conservancy, a company working on sustainability. We focused on a programme called Trash Free Seas. It\u2019s focused on rooting out plastics from our oceans.\u201d In January the journalist Nick McCarvel invited Anderson to speak at an LGBTQ talk at the Australian Open. It bothers Anderson there is no openly gay male player on the Tour. \u201cThere is definitely a stigma attached to it,\u201d he says. \u201cSociety historically has not been very welcoming. Times are changing because people are talking, which is great, but it will take somebody to break that trend. It won\u2019t be easy. It will take a lot of courage. But hopefully if we can be more welcoming it might make it a little bit easier. \u201cOne person doing it might open the gates for others. In the US with team sports there have been a couple of players who have come out. Jason Collins, who was the first NBA player to come out, said one of his biggest challenges was worrying about his teammates. But once he did it and his teammates were supportive of him, it helped others. \u201cTennis is individual so the dynamics are different. My hope is players collectively create an environment where someone feels comfortable. It\u2019s about having good awareness. Jason spoke about this a lot. It\u2019s small things, like saying: \u2018That\u2019s so gay.\u2019 \u201cSomebody who is gay could find it very offensive but not feel comfortable about speaking out. The NBA actually has a system where people are fined for saying that. It can be very offensive and steps like that can be implemented in tennis. It\u2019s part of being respectful and understanding how simple comments like that can be received by others.\u201d These have been challenging times for the players\u2019 council, which is led by Novak Djokovic. The ousting of Chris Kermode as head of the association following a feud with Djokovic left a sour taste, while Justin Gimelstob, an increasingly influential figure in the corridors of power, stepped down from the ATP board in May following his conviction for assault. The Gimelstob affair caused Stan Wawrinka to decry \u201ca worrying decline in moral standards\u201d in the men\u2019s game. \u201cThe council can get very political at times,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cI try to stay as neutral as possible.\u201d Anderson, a relatively late bloomer, has flourished in recent years, losing to Rafael Nadal in the US Open final in 2017 and Djokovic in the final at SW19 last year. He has made his millions. Yet not everyone is so fortunate. Last week the Canadian player Vasek Pospisil took to Twitter to explain the financial challenges faced by lower-ranked players. Anderson empathises with Pospisil. \u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go but we have made huge improvements over the last five or six years,\u201d he says. \u201cThe pension is drastically increased. Prize money is increased. \u201cChanging public perceptions is important. Nobody bats an eyelid in a team sport when a player gets injured and is still getting paid. In tennis there is nothing like that.\u201d As for his immediate ambitions, Anderson hopes to fulfil his dream of becoming a slam champion. Yet this is the toughest era in the sport\u2019s history. \u201cI\u2019ve made two finals and I\u2019m up against guys who have won over 30 grand slams between them,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s been great for the sport. You have to figure it out. Wishing for something else is futile.\u201d Kevin Anderson is competing in the Fever-Tree Championships at the Queen\u2019s Club this week.
