Her dad dug a borehole; they erected a wind turbine. Amy and her older sister cut cabbages at six in the morning and saved up their \u00a31.50-an-hour for Reebok Classics and Kappa Poppers to make them look like everyone else, despite the fact that they travelled to school in a handmade trailer attached to the back of their dad\u2019s bike. \u201cImagine taking phones off your kids now,\u201d says Powney with a laugh. \u201cWell, that\u2019s like what happened to us. We went from a house where you could turn the lights on with a switch, to a caravan where if the wind wasn\u2019t blowing, we couldn\u2019t watch Home and Away.\u201d Flash forward 20-odd years and Powney, 34, is nursing a pink cocktail in the dusky bar of a flash London hotel. She is creative director of the London fashion label Mother of Pearl \u2013 as seen at London Fashion Week twice a year and sold in some of the most prestigious stores in the world \u2013 having in 12 years worked her way up from the bottom of the company to the top. Last year she married Nick Prendiville, who is a retail consultant, and they live in a beautiful house in Walthamstow, east London, with their puppy. And, as it turned out, you can take the girl out of the field, but you can\u2019t take the field out of the girl: something never sat right with Powney and her career in fashion. \u201cI struggled coming into this industry,\u201d she says, squirming. \u201cI\u2019m not a natural fit. You sit at dinner and don\u2019t have the same stories. When I\u2019m talking about cutting cabbages at six in the morning, that\u2019s not what other people at the table are talking about.\u201d More than class-consciousness, the ethics of the industry itself have made her uncomfortable. It\u2019s no secret, much as it might be overlooked, that fashion manufacturing is one of the most environmentally damaging industries in the world, contributing to plastic mountains, harmful emissions, burnt surplus stock, animal cruelty, intensive farming, unsafe working conditions and unfair wages. While she loves the creativity and adores clothes, those evils have always nagged at Powney. \u201cMy upbringing probably set off a process in me,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you can\u2019t just go and switch a light on and off, you have questions about where the power comes from.\u201d Back in the early years of the new millennium, Powney had charged into her degree course at Kingston University raging about the absolute state the world was in. Having read Naomi Klein\u2019s 1999 anti-consumerism book No Logo, she was determined to do an organic, ethical graduate clothing collection. \u201cMy tutors thought I was mad,\u201d she says. Very few designers were doing ethical fashion at the time \u2013 Katharine Hamnett, and some pioneering and daring small labels, fuelled by good will and obstinacy, but with zero industry or state support and little consumer awareness. Powney did what she could. \u201cI used 100% wool, 100% alpaca and reused a few fabrics I\u2019d got from mills,\u201d she says. \u201cI did it. But because it was all so new at the time, you couldn\u2019t just go and get a job in that area. There weren\u2019t any.\u201d Landing an assistant role in 2006 at Mother of Pearl, founded by Maia Norman, was a good compromise. \u201cI thought, it\u2019s a small company, we make quality product, print our silks in the UK, I know all the factories. From a corporate social responsibility level that was pretty good,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t working for the high street or burning clothes. And I fell in love with the company.\u201d But by the time consumers finally started catching up with ethics Powney, now creative director, wasn\u2019t in a position to act according to her values. Mother of Pearl had grown and the demands of fashion retail in a digital world were fierce. \u201cThere were too many collections, too much product and me and the staff were really struggling,\u201d she says. A respite came in the form of the 2017 British Fashion Council/Vogue Fashion Fund award, that won the business \u00a3100,000. Powney took the opportunity to change the retail sales offering back to twice yearly, giving herself time to work on a passion project called No Frills. Two years later and that core collection of sustainable, ethical, traceable clothing has just gone live. \u201cWith No Frills I wanted to be able to say to the consumer, \u2018If you\u2019d like to purchase a garment and know where it\u2019s come from, where it\u2019s been, what materials are in it, how it\u2019s been washed and how the people who have worked on it have been treated, we can do that for you,\u2019\u201d she says. The whopping 34-piece core collection \u2013 from T-shirts to tailoring \u2013 uses Powney\u2019s design signature \u2013 feminine, street-influenced and decorative (ironically, featuring a lot of frills as well as pearls) but with sustainability at the fore. Powney has traced her supply chains to alpaca farms in Peru and wool farms in Uruguay, and has sourced her cotton from farms in Turkey. \u201cNormally a designer goes to a fabric supplier for fabric,\u201d says Powney. \u201cBut if you say to that supplier, who\u2019s usually Italian, \u2018Can you tell me where that came from?\u2019 they\u2019ll say, \u2018No idea.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t grown in Italy, of course. And it was probably bought from China, but China probably bought it somewhere else. Maybe it was dyed in Italy, or woven in another European country and went back somewhere else to be finished. But by the end you\u2019ve been around the world three times!\u201d Powney and her product developer started with geography. \u201cWho grows what? Who makes what? We looked for territories or countries that did the full 360, so that we only used one country or maybe moved it once more for another stage,\u201d says Powney. \u201cWe wanted a small supply chain that we could vet.\u201d In terms of design, No Frills elevates the ethical clothing choices available now, which tend towards the casual and simple. \u201cI wanted to use good fabrics to bridge the gap between the very T-shirty/denim-type brands and the luxury brands of the world. Could I give the woman something that\u2019s sustainable but a bit more design-led?\u201d Included in the collection are MoP signatures like the Jewel Trouser, now using an ethically sourced denim, and a ruffle blouse from certified organic cotton, as well as a double-breasted tailored trouser suit in soft floral jacquard, made from a blend of organic wool and cotton. A brilliant bonus is that for all its ethics, it\u2019s cheaper to buy than the mainline collection (with prices from \u00a390.) Most of it will never go into sale. \u201cIt\u2019s carry-over or trans-seasonal styles that you can wear at any time,\u201d says Powney. \u201cOur aim is that 70% of our business will be No Frills in the next few years.\u201d There\u2019s also a revolutionary way of shopping for it, with a new website enabling customers to filter the whole Mother of Pearl offering (not only No Frills) via 10 sustainable attributes (natural fibres; organic; recycled; digitally printed; traced from field to final; traced from fabric to final; low carbon emissions; low water consumption; respect for animals; mulesing-free (mulesing is an inhumane practice carried out on sheep suffering from flystrike). \u201cSome of our products will only touch one of those attributes,\u201d says Powney. \u201cIt\u2019s not greenwashing \u2013 it\u2019s honest. I just got to a point where I wasn\u2019t happy about the way things were and wanted to do something about it.\u201d She knows there are a million wrongs in the fashion industry and it\u2019s going to take more than her small business to make an impact, but on a personal level she is happier about her place in it. \u201cI never wanted to be a face,\u201d she says. \u201cI never wanted to go out and talk about myself or my outfit. That wasn\u2019t me. But now I\u2019m telling a story I want to tell and I\u2019m fine about that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
