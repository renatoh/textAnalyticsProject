Viva Pi\u00f1ata involves none of these pursuits, and is instead a breed-'em-up, taking place in a lush garden populated by various species of pi\u00f1ata. All can be smashed to release their candy innards, but far more rewarding is to create environments they like until they settle and eventually get busy making baby pi\u00f1atas. Playfully named species including the Bunnyscotch, Sparrowmint and Quackberry visit, stay, have babies, fight and get eaten by pi\u00f1atas higher up the food chain in the confectionary-based circle of life, that is at no time less than family-friendly. Exceptionally mellow to play with its Pixar looks and Dolby 5.1 birdsong, Rare's trademark polish gleams from every surface. \u00b7 Rare, \u00a345 Superman Returns Nintendo DS, PS2, Xbox, Xbox 360 Superman can fly, punch holes through buildings and freeze enemies by breathing on them. For these reasons alone his franchise is an obvious one for conversion to a videogame. Add what the marketing department call a \"major motion picture\", and you'd be forgiven for thinking nothing could go wrong. What emerges, six months after the lukewarm film, is a horrible mess of a game that sees the Man of Steel fighting a never-ending onslaught of anonymous robots strung around no discernible plot and taking place in a suspiciously bland- looking Metropolis. The leadenly prescriptive gameplay either has you punching enemies to death or matching ice breath with hot targets and eye-lasers with cold ones until you feel as though you've regressed to nursery and spent the evening slotting coloured shapes through the appropriate holes in a plastic post box. Utterly empty and devoid of any sort of entertainment value, this is the worst variety of lame, soulless movie-license cash-in. \u00b7 Electronic Arts, \u00a330 Games news: Wii launch It's got a silly name, you control it by waving a wand-style remote control around and it's designed to be fun, even if you've never played a game in your life; the relentless pre-publicity for Wii has effectively imprinted its universal appeal and quirky control mechanics on anyone not living in a sensory deprivation tank. Arriving with Wii Sports, a collection of mini-games including tennis, bowling and boxing, gamers will discover to their horror that resolute game-phobics can now comfortably win the odd round. While long-term play of some games proves exhausting to under-utilised wrist and shoulder muscles, others get easier through small movements of the Wiimote. But it's the spontaneous, tactile sense of play the games inspire that sets Wii apart. Neat, modestly priced and genuinely fresh, the Wii is an exceptionally promising new piece of hardware."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
