Gordon Brown is not thought to be considering these measures for his Budget on Wednesday, but he is being urged to consider them by groups of schoolchildren up and down the country. These and other ideas were put to the Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT) in its annual 'Fantasy Budget' competition, run for schools in conjunction with Bournemouth University. Other ideas included taxing football transfers; junk mail; the amount of rubbish produced by households as an incentive for recycling; and 'second and third cars in families to prevent pollution and tax congestion'. A persistent theme is the use of tax and duties to encourage sustainable development through recycling and greater use of public transport. 'Everybody had something on the environment,' said a CIOT spokeswoman. 'And about 80 per cent had something on public transport.' Most children entering the competition were aged between 15 and 17 - so would reach the age of the current Cabinet and Treasury team in the 2030s. They obviously do not like congested roads. One group of schoolchildren called for the introduction of 'more tollbooths' for charging private car drivers who cross county borders. They felt this scheme would be 'a lot simpler and more efficient' and might 'encourage people to use public transport or share cars'. A rather more controversial proposal from another school was for a 'holiday tax on people entering the country, recoverable by airlines'. This would 'generate government revenue to fund research into pollution-free air travel [and would lead to] improved conditions'. Some of the proposals might generate considerable support if Brown were to test the water with some fresh ideas this week. Members of the public forced to listen to other people's mobile phone conversations on trains and in caf\u00e9s might well support a proposed telecommunications tax, where a '5 per cent levee' [sic] would be placed 'on all mobile phone calls', rising to '7 per cent after five minutes' use'. The drafters of this proposal list as possible benefits: 'To cut excessive and unnecessary calls, as well as limiting the use of phones. Health risks are minimised. Revenue gained can be used for cancer research.' Also potentially popular is the idea of a tax on football transfers. As the proponents of this plan explain, there could be numerous benefits and uses for the cash: 'Tax should be introduced instead of abolishing the system, the money could go to education, and encouraging people into teaching. A decrease in tuition fees would attract more pupils to higher education.' Similarly, the mooted tax on junk mail could well win votes for a government willing to try it. Benefits cited by the schoolchildren include: 'Less rubbish; not as much paper consumption; less to recycle; less irritation to general public; more money for printing news and other important documents.' Several of the ideas put forward have already had support from some parts of the political spectrum - taxes on abnormal company profits, for example. Others - wrapped up in New Labour speak and tweaked a bit - could even be in this Budget. As western governments continue to worry about growing obesity statistics, now could be the time to lower VAT 'on all sports equipment and extra-curricular activities for schools'. The benefits are clear, say the proponents: 'Pressures on time have led to a reduction in sport and exercise in schools, affecting health. Improved health and lifestyle changes as a result of regular exercise [would] also [benefit] the NHS.' The deadline has now closed on the Fantasy Budget competition (and probably on the real Budget as well). Results of the competition are announced at a ceremony at the House of Commons on 30 April. If Brown wants to get in tune with the next generation of voters, perhaps he should pop along. As CIOT president John Whiting asks: 'Would you rule all these ideas out?'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
