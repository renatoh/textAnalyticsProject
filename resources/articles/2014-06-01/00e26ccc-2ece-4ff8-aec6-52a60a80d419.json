The way the Portuguese tells it, he was this close to signing as the England manager in December 2007, to having the job as Steve McClaren\u2019s successor instead of Fabio Capello, who would be appointed by the Football Association. Mourinho\u2019s first spell in charge at Chelsea had ended on 20 September of that year and he had been at home in London for a couple of months, desperate to work and probably getting under the feet of his wife, Matilde. He wanted to stay in England and, because of the terms of his severance with Chelsea, there was only one position that he could take. \u201cAt that time I could not get an English club because of my contract when I left Chelsea \u2026 I couldn\u2019t get an English club in the next two years,\u201d Mourinho says. \u201cI could get the national team but not a club.\u201d The England job was appealing because of the prestige and Mourinho also felt that he had the support of the players, and not only those from Chelsea. \u201cLampard, Terry, Joe Cole, everybody, was saying, \u2018Come, come, come,\u2019\u201d Mourinho says. \u201cMy players said, \u2018The guys from Manchester United and Liverpool call us and say to us: Tell your boss to come.\u2019 I had lots of positive things to push me.\u201d It is fun to speculate how the national team might have fared under Mourinho, who has always admired the traits of English football and, indeed, sought to embrace some of them; he can even say that his sides are rubbish at penalty shoot-outs. It would certainly have placed a different spin on his assessment of the current squad\u2019s chances in Brazil, which he delivers from his role as a Yahoo World Cup ambassador. But one person stood in the way; one person insisted that the job was wrong for him. It was Matilde and, if her reasoning might have been influenced by the possibility of Mourinho dossing about the lounge during the week, it was undoubtedly sound. \u201cMy wife told me not to take it and she was right,\u201d the Chelsea manager says. \u201cIt was the right decision. We are talking about seven years ago \u2026 and I cannot wait two years for a big competition. I cannot be spending two years playing against Kazakhstan and San Marino. \u201cWhat would I do during the week? I could go to see the players training with their teams, I ask for permission to spend time with them and to have individual coaching with them \u2026 I have to work with them, I can improve things. I\u2019m not going to stay at home, I have to travel, I want to see the players, I want to participate in their evolution blah, blah, blah, blah. But in the end my wife was saying: \u2018No football, no matches, is not good for you.\u2019 \u201cAnd she was right. It was not the job for me seven years ago, it\u2019s not the job for me now and I don\u2019t think it will be the job for me in seven years\u2019 time. Maybe in 15 years from now but not seven.\u201d Back when England were lamenting that 3-2 Wembley defeat by Croatia in November 2007, which scuppered their qualification for the Euro 2008 finals, and one man\u2019s temerity to shelter from the driving rain under a brolly, Mourinho found himself analysing the country\u2019s best players. He remembers there being no shortfall in technical quality or experience and yet he could not answer the question as to whether they possessed the requisite mentality. \u201cYou had Lampard and Gerrard in the best years of their career,\u201d Mourinho says. \u201cRooney was in the beginning of his maturity. You had a group of central defenders, all of them in the top moment of their career. Terry, King, Ferdinand, Carragher \u2026 Carragher was not even selected! He was coming in as the fourth or the fifth [choice]. You have fantastic players and [are] never doing it. Why? I don\u2019t know.\u201d Mourinho still cannot answer the question and, like many England fans, he prefers simply to accept that anything is possible from the team. \u201cEngland is the kind of team [from whom] I am always expecting something good but I am never surprised when things go wrong,\u201d Mourinho says. \u201cIf England is world champion, it\u2019s not a surprise for me. If England is knocked out in the group phase, it\u2019s not a surprise for me.\u201d He believes that he is on safer ground in predicting a positive tournament for Wayne Rooney. \u201cWayne is right when he says this is his World Cup,\u201d Mourinho says. \u201cHe\u2019s not a kid any more and he\u2019s not an old player at the end of his career. It\u2019s the World Cup in the right moment. \u201cHe has a role as leader in the team and I think he is ready to cope with this pressure. Maybe the fact that the season was not good for him at United can also play a positive role. He will be ambitious and hungry to succeed.\u201d Mourinho did not want to become embroiled in the discussion about John Terry\u2019s non-availability \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s time to forget John and support Phil Jagielka,\u201d he says \u2013 and, in the end, it came down to penalties. \u201cDon\u2019t speak about penalties with me because I always lose on penalties,\u201d Mourinho says. \u201cThe only time I won was in the Super Cup with Inter when we beat Roma [in 2008]. Imagine how lucky I was \u2013 Totti missed for Roma! But I lost so many times and, after trying everything, my final conclusion is that it\u2019s what He wants [Mourinho points to the heavens]. \u201cAt Real Madrid I didn\u2019t win the Champions League [in 2012] because Ronaldo, Kak\u00e1 and Sergio Ramos missed [in the semi-final shoot-out defeat by Bayern Munich.] These were the best penalty takers. And with Chelsea in the semi-final against Liverpool [in 2007] it was exactly the same. \u201cOne player who was not on our list of takers was Arjen Robben. He said to me: \u2018Put me No1, 100% it\u2019s a goal.\u2019 I did. And he missed. There\u2019s nothing you can do. I keep saying I\u2019m going to win a competition on penalties. It\u2019s going to be a big one.\u201d Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is an exclusive analyst for Yahoo\u2019s football coverage.
