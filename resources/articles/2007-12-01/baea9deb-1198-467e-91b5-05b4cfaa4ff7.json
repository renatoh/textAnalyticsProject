Prolific and outstanding in all these fields, he never seemed to run, but moved with an imposing style and presence. In the 1980s and 1990s, as he reached the top in his several professions, his strange and attractive personality added to his popularity: libertarian and free-thinking, melancholic, pleasure-loving, generous and grumpy. He was born in Lima, Peru, while his Spanish mother, Carola Fern\u00e1n-G\u00f3mez, was touring South America. An Argentine citizen, because his birth was registered later on the tour in Buenos Aires, he arrived in Spain at the age of two. In his memoirs, El tiempo amarillo (The Yellow Time, 1990), he explains how, with no known father, he was brought up by his adoring and adored mother and grandmother. In later years, he believed that actors formed a world apart: excluded from conventional life, theirs was the world of free love, flowing conversation and bohemian night cafes. He was always grateful for the combination of love and freedom he received in his childhood. At the age of 16, in the middle of the Spanish civil war, he entered the acting school run by the CNT (anarchist-led trade union) in Madrid. After the war, he studied philosophy and letters, but gave up his course to work in the theatre, then in films. Between his screen debut in 1943 and 2006, he acted in about 200 films and directed 25. He worked with just about every major Spanish director, from Edgar Neville in the 1940s, the communist Juan Antonio Bardem in the 1950s, Carlos Saura and V\u00edctor Erice in the 1970s, to a younger generation, such as Fernando Trueba in Belle \u00c9poque (1992) and Pedro Almod\u00f3var in All About My Mother (1999). Both these films won an Oscar for best foreign film. In the 1940s and 1950s Fern\u00e1n-G\u00f3mez became a star of rapid paced comedies. He was no romantic lead, though: tall and lanky, red-haired and big-nosed, with a booming voice, he was known as a commercial actor for any part. As he grew older, he gained in physical presence. His distinctive voice spoke with beautiful diction and authority; his ravaged face expressed a life's experience. He started to be taken seriously in 1958, with the comedy La vida por delante (The Life Ahead), which he also directed. He then directed one of his best films, El extra\u00f1o viaje (The Strange Journey), a dark portrait of Spanish rural repression. It came out in 1964, after being censorsed for five years. It was not until 1978, after the end of the Franco dictatorship, that he could freely and fully express himself. This was with the successful Las bicicletas son para el verano (Bicycles Are for Summer), one of six stage plays he wrote. It shows the sufferings of a family and their neighbours in besieged Madrid during the civil war. In the 1970s, he reached an international audience for the first time, starring in Erice's famous El esp\u00edritu de la colmena (The Spirit of the Beehive, 1973). Fern\u00e1n-G\u00f3mez published 11 novels. One of the best is El viaje a ninguna parte (The Journey to Nowhere, 1985), which describes a troupe of impoverished actors traipsing from village to village. It is his greatest tribute to his profession. \"Soy un c\u00f3mico,\" he always replied when asked how he saw himself, and he meant, not \"I am a comic,\" but \"I am a working actor.\" Acting was not a profession, but a way of life. He directed a film of this novel and, in 1986, achieved the unique distinction of winning Goyas (Spain's annual film awards) in three categories: best director and best scriptwriter for El viaje a ninguna parte, and best actor for another film. In all he won five Goyas, more than any other person. Numerous other prizes came his way: the Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias in Arts for 1995 and an honorary Golden Bear for lifetime achievement at the 2005 Berlin film festival. In 1998 he became the only actor to be elected to the Spanish Royal Academy of Language. His last great role was as the republican schoolteacher in La lengua de las mariposas (Butterfly's Tongue, 1999). Fern\u00e1n-G\u00f3mez combined melancholy with gentleness in his portrait of an elderly teacher in a beautiful Galician village just before the outbreak of the civil war. The beauty was about to be smashed for ever, as it was at the end of the film and for all Fern\u00e1n-G\u00f3mez's republican generation. In 1947, Fern\u00e1n-G\u00f3mez married Mar\u00eda Dolores Pradera, a well-known singer. They divorced in 1959. In the early 1970s he and the actor Emma Cohen started to live together. They married in 2000. She survives him, as do his two children from his first marriage, Elena and Fernando. \u00b7 Fernando Fern\u00e1n-G\u00f3mez, actor, film director and novelist, born August 28 1921; died November 21 2007"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
