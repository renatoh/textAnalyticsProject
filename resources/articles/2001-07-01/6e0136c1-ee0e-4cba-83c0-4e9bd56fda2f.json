Frustrated with the limited resources available in the Scottish Premier League, Dermot Desmond, Celtic's majority shareholder, believes his club and Rangers will be in the Premiership within five years. \"This will happen,\" said Desmond. \"The ball has been set rolling and there have been preliminary discussions between the chairmen of a number of clubs about it.\" Desmond says joining the Premiership is the only way the Old Firm can compete with Europe's top clubs because of the huge gap in TV income. Celtic currently receive \u00a33m a year for TV rights while a middling Premiership club such as Leicester City get \u00a320m. The Scottish Premier League is trying to secure a \u00a330m-a-year broadcasting deal to begin in 2002 but even that is surrounded by controversy, with Rangers and Celtic demanding the lion's share. England's 72 Nationwide League clubs share a \u00a3380m, three-year TV and internet contract. Total rights to the Premiership went for \u00a31.6bn. The top Scottish clubs have tried to increase their revenue by proposing an Atlantic League comprising teams from the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium and Scandinavia, but Uefa blocked the idea. However, the Premier League seems set against the latest idea. \"It is not on the cards,\" said its spokesman Philip French. \u0095 Arsenal are close to signing the Japan international midfielder Junichi Inamoto, 21, after reaching agreement with his club Gamba Osaka. The deal, to be announced after the J-League season breaks on 21 July, will make Inamoto the first Japanese player to play in the Premiership. Freddie Ljungberg has signed a new five-year deal with Arsenal worth around \u00a33m a season. \u0095 Real Madrid have denied reports linking them with Arsenal's Patrick Vieira. \"We never talked about signing Vieira,\" said Real's general sporting director Jorge Valdano, who is responsible for transfers. \u0095 Chelsea have made contact with the father of the Barcelona winger Boudewijn Zenden, who acts as his agent, to register their interest in the 25-year-old, according to Spanish reports. \u0095 Newcastle's manager Bobby Robson has all but given up hope of signing Zenden, despite Barcelona accepting a \u00a37.2m bid, after also apparently failing to lure the \u00a310m-rated Paris St-Germain striker Laurent Robert.\"We've put good money on the table for two outstanding players, without any success,\" Robson said. \u0095 Everton are on the verge of signing the Canadian striker Tomasz Radzinski from Anderlecht after making an increased offer, believed to be \u00a34.5m. \u0095 The Internazionale coach Hector Cuper has confirmed his interest in Chelsea's \u00a36m-rated Italian midfielder Sam Dalla Bona. \u0095 Notts County have bought the Leeds striker Tony Hackworth for \u00a3120,000. Ipswich's academy assistant director Paul Goddard has returned to West Ham as Glenn Roeder's No2. The Carlisle manager Ian Atkins has quit to become the No2 at Cardiff City. \u0095 Watford have signed the former Milan defender Filippo Galli, 38, on a free transfer and accepted a \u00a3300,000 offer from Wigan for the Northern Ireland international Peter Kennedy.
