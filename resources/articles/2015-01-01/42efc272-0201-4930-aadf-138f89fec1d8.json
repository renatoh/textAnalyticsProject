In November Rohit Sharma scored 264 from 173 balls for India against Sri Lanka, obliterating by 45 runs the ODI record set by Virender Sehwag. Then shortly after Christmas, in Christchurch, and also against Sri Lanka, Brendon McCullum, with 195 from 134 balls, was within a couple of yards of beating by a distance his compatriot Nathan Astle\u2019s already remarkable 154-ball record for the fastest Test match double hundred. And now De Villiers scores 149 from 44 balls, sweeping the board with all sorts of ODI records including fastest 100, from 31 balls. It almost needs a second look to make sure that a digit has not been omitted from the front. That it happened at the Wanderers in Johannesburg ought to be no great surprise. In July 2006 Sri Lanka made 443 for nine against Netherlands in Amstelveen, still the record ODI score, but the highest between full members had been at the Wanderers a few months earlier when Australia made 434 for four (with Ricky Ponting hitting 164 from 105 balls). \u201cIt\u2019s a 450 pitch \u2013 they are short,\u201d joked Jacques Kallis during the interval and, sure enough, South Africa replied with 438 for nine to win the match. Now De Villiers hits 16 sixes, equalling Sharma\u2019s record, as South Africa made 439 for two. The Wanderers is habitually high-scoring, with a fine pitch, short boundaries and, at almost 1,800m elevation, it is the highest international ground. Golfers who play on the Wanderers course behind the stand at one end will say that you can take 10% from distances for clubbing purposes (see metres and think in yards). The average ODI score in the past four years is 363. This tells only part of the story, however. Techniques, innovations and a spirit of adventure gained from Twenty20 cricket have found their way into the longer forms of the game. Gym work pays dividends. Strokes that have been around for decades \u2013 reverse sweep, switch hit, even the ramp (I played at school with a fellow who could stand square on and flip a length delivery over his head; he became a senior policeman) \u2013 have graduated from being declared outrageous and an affront to mainstream. The biggest development has been the capacity to deal with yorkers, once the go-to response, upsetting length either by hanging back deep in the crease or by stepping forward and using bat-speed (which sounds like a superpower), bottom hand and muscle. Fielding restrictions, the draconian rule on wides and the limit on bouncers, have hampered bowlers almost to an unfair degree so that damage limitation becomes a default position all too readily. Boundary ropes have crept in, first to prevent injury from perimeter fences, then to provide camera positions and, more insidiously, to ensure that the game produces an ever-increasing number of sixes. When a competition such as the IPL actually has sixes sponsored, then clearly there is a commercial imperative: the more sixes, the more exposure, the more television airtime and thus more income. No one there is going to advocate a reduction. Should India bat first when they play Zimbabwe in Auckland next month, given the ludicrously small straight boundaries, 500 is a real possibility. Always, though, the debate returns to bats. Modern high-end blades bear little relation to those of even a decade ago. The bludgeons in use now are habitually described as \u201cheavy\u201d and that is a misnomer. These blades have volume but reduced density whether through the absence of moisture, a lack of pressing or both. They are disposable implements, produced for effectiveness rather than durability. The propensity for genuinely heavy bats, up to three and a half pounds, as used by some in the 1970s and 80s, came about \u2013 I was told \u2013 as a consequence of the absence of sufficient properly seasoned cricket bat willow, so that the only way to make a bat that \u201cwent\u201d was to give it weight. That has changed. The modern bat is perhaps half a pound and more lighter than these \u2013 around 2lb 8oz \u2013 but is volumetrically greater, as evidenced by the edges which serve as effectively as the middle on occasions. I would contest the notion that as a rule bigger sixes are being hit (in my playing days, I saw three hits to the very top of the Lord\u2019s pavilion but heard of none since) but the massive expansion of the sweet spot ensures that what were once mis-hits now also carry, so there are almost exponentially more year on year. A solution, if there needs to be one, is clear: rein the bats in through legislation, in terms not of weight but of dimension, so that the edges have a maximum thickness and there is a maximum depth. It is simple really but will never happen. Firstly, those who are counselled lack true empathy for bowlers. The ICC cricket committee is chaired by a spinner, Anil Kumble, and currently Ottis Gibson also sits. But of 14 members of the trumpeted MCC World Cricket Committee, nine are or were batsmen, two are wicketkeepers and one an umpire. Tim May, a spinner, and Shaun Pollock, a pace bowler, fight a lone battle. There are as many women or umpires as seamers on it and twice as many keepers. As MCC itself is custodian of the laws, which govern the specifications of bats, it is not hard to see the implications. Above all, though, those who run the game, both at international and at domestic level, do not see a problem but rather an asset. Close, low-scoring contests are all very well but nothing beats a run-fest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
