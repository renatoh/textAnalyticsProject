Guardian Australia has learned that \u2013 in a bid to stop the forced redundancies of almost one-third of the Opera Australia orchestra\u2019s 56 full-time employees \u2013 the musicians took the unprecedented step of holding a confidential ballot on 25 September to signal to management its unwillingness to continue working with the concertmaster and orchestra director Jun Yi Ma. According to the orchestra\u2019s now-redundant principal clarinettist, Peter Jenkin, the musicians\u2019 revolt was fuelled by anger at Ma\u2019s alleged participation on a four-member panel that was formed to decide who to sack. The motion of no confidence, which has been seen by Guardian Australia, noted that such a course of action had not been taken lightly. \u201cIt is devastating that we find ourselves in this situation, but unfortunately Jun has demonstrated through his actions that his position as our leader is now untenable,\u201d the motion reads. \u201cSpecifically, his role in the redundancies, his unwillingness or inability to communicate support to his colleagues, his unwillingness to meet with player reps, and his active attempts to undermine [the union] MEAA\u2019s campaign to save the positions, make it clear that we cannot continue to support him.\u201d As concertmaster, one of Ma\u2019s roles is to be chief intermediary in any contentious issue between the players and a conductor, or company management. But his additional title of orchestra director \u2013 not a common title found in opera orchestras \u2013 appears to have placed Ma firmly in the managerial camp. The company\u2019s chief executive, Rory Jeffes, was informed of the vote of no confidence \u2013 signed almost unanimously, sources told the Guardian \u2013 but the motion was never formally tabled to management. An OA spokeswoman declined to comment on the no-confidence motion, but told the Guardian the continuing Covid-19 crisis forced the company into making redundancies. \u201cThey were very difficult decisions for all involved and certainly not made lightly,\u201d she said in a statement. The shortfall in players will be filled by casual freelance musicians, possibly including some of those who were only recently made redundant. \u2018Anger and disappointment\u2019 In the face of a protracted shutdown brought on by Covid-19 in March, Opera Australia\u2019s board approved cuts to all permanent positions across creative, technical and administrative operations in August, without the opportunity for voluntary redundancies. The bulk of remaining staff were placed on jobkeeper, and the company set in motion preparations to sell its Sydney warehouse in Alexandria and much of its contents, including costumes and props. By the end of November, the orchestra will meet as a whole for the first time in more than six months to begin rehearsals for the 2021 summer season. Its size will have shrunk by almost one-third, and the musicians will be squaring off with a concertmaster many may no longer wish to work with. \u201cThere is an expectation that a concertmaster goes in to bat for his musicians,\u201d Jenkin told Guardian Australia. \u201cIf he was pushed into a corner [by management] to sit on that panel, then the right thing to do would have been resign, not move against his own orchestra.\u201d Another musician, whose position was not cancelled and who spoke on condition of anonymity, said management had placed Ma in an impossible position. \u201cHe wears two hats, and as orchestra director he had no option but to participate,\u201d the musician said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t change people\u2019s feelings of anger and disappointment in him.\u201d Oboist Mark Bruwel, who had been with the orchestra for more than 30 years before being dismissed on 25 September, said there were deep concerns over the lack of transparency in the mass forced redundancy procedure. As president of the Symphony Orchestra Musicians Association [Soma] up until September and a former member of the orchestra\u2019s work health and safety committee, Bruwel told Guardian Australia some musicians, including himself, believed they were sacked because of their union activities. \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that people who were outspoken on issues were targeted in the elimination process,\u201d he said. Jenkin, a musicians\u2019 representative on the MEAA\u2019s federal council, told Guardian Australia his case to the Fair Work Commission would argue that his dismissal was based in part on his union membership. The OA spokeswoman denied claims that redundancies were motivated by union activities of their members. \u201cDecisions regarding these redundancies were solely based on the positions required by Opera Australia into the future in responding to this once-in-a-century crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cWe appreciate the significant role that the union plays in the organisation and respect and support our employees\u2019 rights to be a member of the union. \u201cWe consider that we enjoy a positive and productive relationship with the union and are continuing to work with them during these difficult times.\u201d Jenkin and Bruwel are among as many as nine redundant OA musicians, choristers and crew who have so far brought cases of unfair dismissal against the company in the Fair Work Commission, with hearings beginning next week. On Monday, the federal arts minister, Paul Fletcher, met with Jeffes and the OA chair, David Mortimer, to discuss the company\u2019s financial predicament. \u201cOpera Australia, like many other institutions across the nation, is facing difficult decisions in response to Covid-19,\u201d Fletcher told the Guardian. \u201cWhile these decisions are for the board and management, the loss of any Australian job is always regrettable.\u201d OA will receive $21.853m in recurrent federal funding in 2020 and that support would continue into 2021, he said. \u2018A brazen strategy to casualise the workforce\u2019 The Guardian has been given a copy of an email that was sent to OA staff \u2013 including the 16 musicians it had sacked \u2013 on Wednesday. The email called for expressions of interest to fill at least 13 newly vacated \u201ctemporary\u201d positions in the orchestra, across woodwind, string, brass and percussion. The MEAA\u2019s director for musicians, Paul Davies, told the Guardian the company was now scrambling to fill the very positions it purported were redundant in September. \u201cThere appears to be no real change to the operating model as claimed, but rather a brazen strategy to casualise the workforce and reduce wages and conditions,\u201d Davies said. OA\u2019s spokeswoman told Guardian Australia on Monday that previous OA employees were welcome \u201cand indeed have been encouraged, to apply for any vacant seasonal positions that become available in the future\u201d. Federal Labor\u2019s arts spokesman, Tony Burke, said OA management needed to explain itself. \u201c[They] should explain why just a few weeks after sacking permanent performers they\u2019re now hiring temporary replacements,\u201d Burke told Guardian Australia. \u201cArts workers deserve the same job security as anyone else.\u201d Bruwel said he believed that Opera Australia \u201chad committed an act of cultural vandalism\u201d on the orchestra and the company\u2019s chorus and crew. \u201cThere was an ideological as well as a financial agenda and [OA] very much took advantage of Covid-19 to run it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
