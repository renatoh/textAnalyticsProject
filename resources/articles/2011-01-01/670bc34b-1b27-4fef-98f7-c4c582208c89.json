Unlike frustration-prone Sheremetyevo airport, home to the state carrier Aeroflot, Domodedovo has a reputation for being relatively efficient. Its security regime was questioned in 2004 when two female Chechen suicide bombers were able to carry dev-ices on to two passenger planes and detonate them in midair, killing 89. However, according to one western security expert, the airport reacted \"positively\" to those incidents. \"When they had the black widows attack, they beefed up security quite significantly,\" said Norman Shanks. According to Shanks, the airport has several sophisticated body scanners. In other respects, the airport is European, with numerous cafes and snack bars on two floors, as well as internet facilities, boutiques and duty free shops airside where you can buy Russian Standard vodka. Philip Baum, editor of Aviation Security International, said the attack had confirmed the industry's worst fears. \"The aviation security community has been talking for years about the threat of suicide bombers detonating themselves at airports so it is no surprise that this has happened.\" Baum said passenger profiling, where people deemed to be behaving suspiciously are singled out for further checks, could help locate terrorists in public areas in airports. He said baggage screening and metal detectors, the bane of regular airline customers, were becoming ineffective. \"The international community has got to get away from these ridiculous security measures that have never been proven to work.\" It is known that there is an x-ray scanner near the revolving entrance to the airport, although more usually than not there is nobody there operating it. Shanks said increased observation of passengers was the only sensible solution to the new threat. \"It is not practical to check everyone coming into the airport meet-and-greet area,\" he said. However, Shanks said profiling only identified a threat rather than neutralising it. \"The danger is that once that person is spotted, they could trigger the device, when there probably will be lots of people still around them.\" BAA, the owner of Heathrow airport in London, has already launched a trial of so-called \"behavioural profiling\", whereby specially trained staff look for suspicious or anomalous behaviour by people in the airport and, if staff remain concerned after questioning their subjects, refer them to immigration officers or police. The trial has led to prosecutions and criminal convictions, but BAA has not revealed whether those convictions were for terrorist offences."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
