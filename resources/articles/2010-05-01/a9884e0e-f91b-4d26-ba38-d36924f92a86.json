Same stuff, different day. To say there is nothing new in Floyd Landis's allegations about Lance Armstrong and some of those in his orbit would be incorrect. However, the process is depressingly familiar to anyone who has followed cycling's 12 troubled years since Willy Voet was arrested with a carload of drugs in 1998, sparking off the drip-feed of confession, conviction, revelation and allegation that has so poisoned the last decade and more. This latest twist to the Landis case follows the same template set by Voet and the other pentiti: deny until you are desperate, then confess. What varies is the length of time they can keep up the pretence. Landis contested every claim, sought every convoluted explanation science could offer, exhausted every last appeal opportunity, mobilised public support, spent a small fortune. His fellow American Tyler Hamilton did the same following his positive test for blood doping in 2004. In Landis's case the due process of his case dragged through until 1 July 2008. His two-year ban ended 25 days later. Landis's years of self-delusion might prompt incredulity among outsiders but it is nothing novel in cycling's recent past. In October 2000, for instance, in a courtroom in Lille Richard Virenque confessed to doping after more than two years of convoluted denial. That for the first time revealed the extent to which cyclists who take drugs can convince themselves they are clean in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Landis states in his emails that he hopes his allegations may serve some purpose if properly investigated but the simple fact is this: had he come out with his allegations at the time of his positive test for testosterone in the Tour de France in 2006, they would have carried infinitely greater weight. To spend years in denial before turning round and contradicting everything you have clung to over that time \u2013 whatever the details you can produce \u2013 means that any attempt to investigate the allegations can be countered with one simple argument: why should any credence be given to someone who has behaved in this way? Compare and contrast with David Millar. He is not a saint but the Briton's period in denial as the allegations mounted around him in 2004 was infinitely shorter \u2013 a matter of a few months \u2013 and was followed by a prompt confession, a willingness to accept the consequences of his actions, and positive action to redress the harm he had done to his sport. It follows that Millar now has far more credibility than any other cyclist who has been through the mire of drug scandal. A prompt confession from Landis would have spared his sport two years of SSDD. During that time the minutiae of claim and counterclaim resembled a soap opera and, more damagingly, attempts were made to discredit the anti-doping process, providing ammunition for those who had wanted to spare his fellow American Greg LeMond a harrowing day in court in May 2007, when LeMond revealed that a threat had been made by an associate of Landis to reveal that LeMond had told Landis of childhood sexual abuse. Discussing the doping issue after Landis's positive in the 2006 Tour, one high-level sports administrator suggested that cycling should go down a radical road in an attempt to combat doping. There should, he said, be a two-wheeled equivalent of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. With the incentive of an amnesty, cyclists should be able to present themselves in front of a tribunal in complete anonymity to confess what they had taken and when and how. The results should be shown to the peloton to shock them into stopping by making them aware of the sheer blind stupidity of what they were doing. The problem that this administrator highlighted and which the Landis episode underlines is this: there is no framework for cyclists who wish to tell what they know, to contribute to cleaning up their sport. Anyone who wants to bring his misdeeds into the daylight will paya price \u2013 although Millar would contend that the price is well worth paying. An amnesty, an open forum, is simply too radical a step. When LeMond challenged Landis to confess all he knew, if he indeed had used drugs, LeMond told him he could change the sport. Unless Landis's allegations are fully investigated by an independent body, there is little chance of that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
