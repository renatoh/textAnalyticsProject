Saayman, a former Currie Cup rugby union player who helped Bedford to victory in last year's Powergen Vase at Twickenham, is understood to have placed the bets when he was out with a knee injury earlier this season. He is the first player to be banned for breaching the RFL's operational rules which forbid gambling on any professional matches since the case involving Sean Long and Martin Gleeson of St Helens in 2004."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
