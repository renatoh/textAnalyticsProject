The retired four-star general spurned his good friend, the Republican John McCain, to heap praise on the \"transformational figure\" of Obama, the Democratic party candidate, saying America needed a \"generational change\". In a swipe at both Bush and McCain, he added: \"I firmly believe that at this point in America's history, we need a president who will not just continue, even with a new face and with the changes and with some maverick aspects, who will not just continue basically the policies that we have been following in recent years.\" Coming 15 days before the US presidential election, Powell's endorsement was the second important boost to Obama yesterday. The other was the news that his campaign had raised a record $150m (\u00a386m) in September, dwarfing his previous monthly high of $65m in August, and bringing the total raised to $605m. At the weekend, Obama also attracted his biggest US audience of the campaign, when 100,000 people attended a rally in St Louis, Missouri. On Saturday evening, 75,000 people attended an Obama rally in Kansas City. The huge turnouts came as the latest national polls showed the presidential race essentially static, with Obama maintaining a lead of 4%-7%. Speaking on the TV programme Meet the Press, Powell, 71, offered an impassioned endorsement of Obama, and a harsh repudiation of the McCain campaign. \"It was not easy for me to disappoint Senator McCain in the way that I have done this morning,\" Powell said. \"We need a transformational figure, a president who is a generational change, That is why I'm supporting Barack Obama. \"Because of his ability to inspire, because of the inclusive nature of his campaign, because he is reaching out all across America, because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities - and you have to take that into account - he has both style and substance, he has met the standard of being a successful president, being an exceptional president.\" He said race was not a factor in his decision, but added: \"It will be an historic event for an African-American to become president, and, if that happens, all Americans should be proud.\" Powell, who said he had made up his mind over the last two months, was damning about McCain's response to the economic crisis, about what he described as the Republican party's drift further to the right during the campaign, and the attack politics of recent weeks. He also had harsh words for McCain's selection of Alaska governor Sarah Palin as running mate. \"He [McCain] was a little unsure about how to deal with the economic problems,\" Powell said. \"That concerned me. I was also concerned at the selection of Governor Palin ... I don't believe she's ready to be vice-president of the United States. That raises some questions ... about the judgment Senator McCain made.\" He also criticised the McCain campaign for focusing on Obama's alleged ties to the 1960s radical William Ayers. \"Why do we keep talking about him and why do we have these robocalls going on?\" he asked. \"This goes too far ... it's not what the American people are looking for. The party has moved even further to the right ... The approach of the Republican party and Mr McCain has become narrower and narrower. Obama has been more inclusive,\" Powell said. Obama said he was \"beyond honoured and deeply humbled\" by Powell's support. At a rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, he said: \"[Powell] knows, as we do, that this is a moment where we need to come together as one nation - young and old, rich and poor, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, Republican and Democrat.\" Addressing a crowd of 10,000, Obama added: \"He reminded us that at this defining moment we don't have the luxury of relying on the same political games, the same political tactics that have been used in so many elections to divide us from one another and make us afraid of one another.\" McCain said he was not surprised by the endorsement. He was pleased he had the backing of four other former secretaries of state and many military leaders. Speaking on Fox television, he said: \"We're very happy with the way the campaign is going. I've been on enough campaigns, my friend, to sense enthusiasm and momentum, and we've got it.\" Despite Obama's lead in both poll ratings and fundraising, McCain said he could sense \"things are heading our way.\" \"I love being the underdog. You know every time that I've gotten ahead, somehow I've messed it up,\" McCain said. Powell's endorsement should aid Obama in foreign policy and national security, areas in which he is thought to be weaker. Powell served as national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan, was appointed chairman of the joint chiefs of staff by the first President George Bush, and was secretary of state during the current president's first term. While his endorsement carries great weight with Republicans, his standing among liberals was knocked following his speech to the UN before the invasion of Iraq. His enthusiastic support for Obama's \"steadiness\" and \"intellectual vigour\", however, will reassure many Democrats. The money raised in September enables Obama to push his campaign into Republican areas, forcing the McCain campaign to spend money to shore up support in what should be safe states. The Obama campaign said the average donation was less than $100. September brought 632,000 new donors, bringing the total number during the campaign to 3.1 million. The Democratic national committee also raised $49.9m in September. McCain chose to accept public funding of his campaign, which limits the amount he can spend in September and October to $84m. The Republican National Committee raised $66m in September. Much of Obama's financial advantage can be seen on the country's TV screens, where Democrat campaign commercials outplay McCain by three or four to one. The Obama campaign has even purchased a half hour prime-time slot on the major networks a week before the election day.
