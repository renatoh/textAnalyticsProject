The Cupertino company described the 7in device, which comes in white and \u201cspace grey\u201d, as a \u201cbreakthrough home speaker\u201d designed to \u201crock the house\u201d. This means that Apple has placed an emphasis on audio quality, packing the speaker with an array of seven tweeters and a woofer as well as \u201cspatial awareness\u201d that detects its location in a room and adapts the output automatically. In announcing the HomePod, Apple CEO Tim Cook said there were many companies making products for enjoying music in the home but \u201cnone have nailed it yet\u201d. He mentioned wireless speaker systems such as Sonos that \u201csound good but are not smart\u201d and \u201cother smart speakers\u201d (presumably a reference to Amazon Echo and Google Home) that \u201cdon\u2019t sound great\u201d. \u201cWe want to combine this all,\u201d he said. HomePod is controlled using Siri, the company\u2019s voice-activated personal assistant, which has, according to Apple, been trained to be better at answering questions about music such as \u201cHey Siri, who\u2019s the drummer in this?\u201d \u201cApple reinvented portable music with iPod, and now HomePod will reinvent how we enjoy music wirelessly throughout our homes,\u201d said Philip Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice-president of worldwide marketing. The device can also be used to send messages, get updates on news, sports and weather and control smart home devices connected using Apple\u2019s HomeKit. At $349, it will be more expensive than Google Home ($109) and Amazon Echo ($179) but cheaper than the Sonos Play 5 ($499). The product will launch in the US, UK and Australia in December 2017 and in other markets in 2018. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very Apple-esque product in that it seeks to stake out the high end of a market with its technology, price and positioning,\u201d said analyst Paul Erickson from IHS Markit. However, Erickson described the price point as \u201caspirational\u201d given that consumer expectations have been set by cheaper competitors, \u201calthough Apple has done a great job of being extremely profitable without having to cater to the mainstream, and they will drop their price over time\u201d, he said. Besides the HomePod, Apple unveiled a collection of new and upgraded products, including a new computer, the $4,999 iMac Pro. The more powerful iMac is intended to address concerns of creative professionals who had been limited to much less powerful iMacs or the much-loved Mac Pro, which hasn\u2019t been updated since 2013. There was also a new 10.5in version of the iPad Pro, the tablet for professional users, which can support a full-sized keyboard cover. The device has a better display, is faster, and comes with 64GB of memory. The device will start at $649 and start shipping next week. There\u2019s also a 12.9in version that starts at $799. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pushing the boundary of iPads, and today, we\u2019re going to push them further than we ever have before,\u201d Cook said. Just as Google and Facebook did at their developer conferences this year, Apple announced an augmented reality platform called ARKit to allow developers to more easily create augmented reality apps, such as Pok\u00e9mon Go, which overlay digital objects on to the real world. Apple\u2019s senior vice-president of software engineering, Craig Federighi, demonstrated the company\u2019s AR capabilities by placing a virtual coffee cup, lamp and vase onto a real table. Given that it is already supported by millions of iPads and iPhones it will, Federighi said, \u201cbe the largest AR platform in the world\u201d. There were also a couple of updates to Apple\u2019s web browser, Safari, including a speed boost that makes it, according to Apple, the fastest ever desktop browser. It also introduced autoplay blocking, which stops music and video from playing automatically without your permission on websites as well as \u201cintelligent tracking prevention\u201d, which stops ads from following you around the web.
