Watford manager Ray Lewington - once a Fulham player - had suggested that his old club would be feeling the pressure. 'Confidence is at least 20 per cent of any performance,' he said. 'I look back to our win over Southampton and I remember their nervousness that night. If a side is not doing well in the Premiership, there will always be an element of doubt in the players' minds when they take on a Championship side.' Lewington's own team, though, have hardly been doing well in the league either, and it was no more than Fulham deserved when they took the lead after 17 minutes. Mark Pembridge hit an excellent free-kick to the far post, where Fulham's towering centre-back, Zat Knight, nodded the ball home. But Watford scored an equaliser just before half-time through a Heidar Helguson penalty. Other Premiership teams who failed to get the better of Championship clubs included Blackburn, who had to settle for a 1-1 draw at Cardiff. One of the best performances came from League Two leaders Yeovil, who won 3-0 at Rotherham , the Championship's bottom club. A drab game was lit up in the 61st minute when Phil Jevons tucked away his 19th goal of the season from the spot after Paul Terry had been upended. The Millers' misery was complete when Darren Way and Andrejs Stolcers netted two further goals in the last three minutes. League Two promotion hopefuls Swansea , who reached the fifth round last season, drew 1-1 at Reading, currently fourth in the Championship. League One strugglers Blackpool gained a 2-2 draw at Leicester. Millwall's achievement in reaching last season's FA Cup Final counted for nothing at Wolves, where the Lions were effectively destroyed in the first 11 minutes. Wolves opened the scoring from their first noteworthy chance after eight minutes, when Ki-Hyeon Seol collected a loose ball on the edge of the penalty area and celebrated his 26th birthday in style by beating one opponent, and then Millwall goalkeeper Graham Stack. Wolves increased their lead three minutes later when Carl Cort headed home. Millwall, having been forced to make a number of changes to their team, rarely looked like scoring and only two fine second-half saves by Stack from Kenny Miller prevented Wolves scoring again. It was their first win in the seven matches since Glenn Hoddle became their manager and he said: 'I'm delighted with this breakthrough. We hope this is going to kick-start us in the league as well, because it should give us some confidence. We played some excellent stuff in the first half and we came out of the blocks much quicker than them.' Of the other ties, one player who stood out more than most was Nottingham Forest's Andy Reid in the 3-0 win at QPR. The Republic of Ireland winger, linked with a \u00a34million move to Tottenham, put his team ahead with a curling free-kick and a minute later supplied the pass from which Kris Commons made it 2-0 from 30 yards - his first goal for the club since a \u00a3300,000 move from Stoke."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
