In a statement on Friday night Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, reiterated the party\u2019s opposition to the backstop but did not criticise the prime minister\u2019s reported acceptance that there could not be a customs border on the island of Ireland. \u201cThe DUP has always indicated that the United Kingdom must leave the EU as one nation and in so doing that no barriers to trade are erected within the UK,\u201d said Foster, warning against any measure that would \u201ctrap\u201d Northern Ireland in the EU\u2019s single market or customs union. She vowed to use the party\u2019s \u201cpivotal\u201d influence at Westminster \u2013 it has 10 MPs and holds sway over some Conservative party Brexiters \u2013 to block any deal that violated the UK\u2019s constitutional integrity. However, the statement also recognised \u201cthe need to be flexible and look at Northern Ireland-specific solutions\u201d, leaving the door open to a possible compromise between Downing Street and Brussels. Ian Paisley, one of the party\u2019s most ardent Brexiter MPs, said that the DUP would vote down any deal it did not like, but did not pre-emptively condemn Downing Street\u2019s apparent backtracking. Rival unionists, however, pounced on the reports. Jim Allister, the leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice party, said: \u201cIf the proposals we\u2019re beginning to hear about are correct it would totally disintegrate that economic unity \u2026 No matter how you dress it up, that is a fundamental assault upon our position within the United Kingdom.\u201d Jim Nicholson, an Ulster Unionist party (UUP) former MEP, said the region could be left on the \u201cwindow ledge\u201d of the union. \u201cI fear that Northern Ireland is being offered up by Boris Johnson as the sacrificial lamb to save Brexit for the rest of the UK, the European Research Group and especially English nationalists.\u201d Another obstacle to any Brexit deal is the lack of a functioning Stormont assembly and executive. Unionist and nationalist parties voiced scepticism on Friday that they could break the region\u2019s 998-day political impasse. Any Brexit deal is expected to require democratic consent for Northern Ireland\u2019s continued alignment with the EU\u2019s single market in goods, a conundrum with no obvious solution if Stormont remains mothballed. Almost 1,000 days on from the collapse of power-sharing, Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP traded blame for the paralysis and unveiled no plans to restore devolution. Robin Swann, the leader of the UUP, called the inability of Northern Ireland\u2019s two biggest parties to share power an abject failure of politics. \u201cTheir toxic mixture of arrogance, disrespect and incompetence has led the country to where it is today,\u201d he said. Stormont collapsed in January 2017 over a botched renewable heating initiative, the so-called cash for ash scandal. The biggest obstacle to the restoration of power-sharing is an Irish language act. Colum Eastwood, the leader of the moderate nationalist SDLP, said there was negligible progress despite urgency over Brexit and atrophying public services. \u201cThe cold truth is that we are no closer to Irish-language legislation now than we were three years ago. We are facing a national emergency on this island as a no-deal Brexit draws nearer.\u201d The murder of the journalist Lyra McKee in April by dissident republicans galvanised British and Irish officials to shepherd parties into talks at Stormont, with all sides expressing concern at armed groups filling the political void. Talks stalled amid mistrust between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in. Not even the imminent decriminalisation of abortion on 22 October \u2013 unless the assembly reconvenes before that date \u2013 persuaded the anti-abortion DUP to return. Naomi Long, the leader of the Alliance party, called the political stalemate \u201cshameful\u201d. A campaign group, We Deserve Better, is due to hold a protest outside Stormont on Sunday. The gloom in Belfast contrasted with hope in Brussels after British and EU negotiators got the green light to intensify talks to try to hammer out a Brexit deal. There have been two key sticking points: Downing Street\u2019s insistence on a customs border on the island of Ireland; and a mechanism for gaining democratic consent for Northern Ireland\u2019s alignment with the EU\u2019s single market. The latter had raised anxiety in some quarters over a DUP veto on trading arrangements. Thursday\u2019s meeting between Johnson and his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, ended with both sides declaring a \u201cpathway\u201d to a possible Brexit deal, suggesting compromise on both issues. Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, told the BBC there would not be a situation where \u201cone community has a veto\u201d over Brexit plans. He said there was \u201ca range of options\u201d for finding consent. He did not rule out a Northern Ireland-only referendum. \u201cThe key thing is we have to have regard to the Good Friday agreement and have regard to the need to have a cross-community approach to how we resolve this.\u201d Northern Ireland\u2019s business community has repeatedly warned of ruin if the UK leaves without a deal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
