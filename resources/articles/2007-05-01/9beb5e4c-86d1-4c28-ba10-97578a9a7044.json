The incumbent, Matt Prior, was born in South Africa, as was the soon-to-be qualified Nic Pothas, and Gerard Brophy is having a decent season for Yorkshire. But newest on the circuit is Somerset's Craig Kieswetter. And, importantly, though he has a British passport through his Scottish mother, he has another three years of eligibility qualification in which to hone his talents quietly. Born in Johannesburg, he went to the Diocesan College in Cape Town, alma mater to Herschelle Gibbs, before moving to Millfield School to do his A-levels. The former Somerset left-arm seamer Mark Davis immediately spotted his talent there and Somerset quickly signed him. Runs flowed in the second XI last year and it was no surprise when he was called up for his first-team debut against Glamorgan in Somerset's opening Friends Provident Trophy fixture this season. He made some impression. Coming in at No8 with his side 175 for six and Simon Jones midway through a menacingly quick spell, he saw off the England bowler with aplomb before embarking on an innings of class, style and no little improvisation. He made 69 off 58 balls in ushering Somerset to an unassailable 310, hitting Robert Croft for one towering six over midwicket and playing one remarkable scoop shot off the seamer Huw Waters. With Glamorgan's keeper, Mark Wallace, standing up, Kieswetter stepped across his stumps and helped the low full toss past Wallace's left ear for the cheekiest of boundaries. Cheek, or confidence, is not a problem. Kieswetter is already among a small band of batsmen to have questioned the umpire's decision using the new referral system, doing so in its inaugural outing when Somerset entertained Sussex. It didn't do him any good, though, as the caught-behind decision off Robin Martin-Jenkins was upheld. Like most keepers he is strong behind square on both sides of the wicket. He may, however, have to be careful with his pick- up - he stands with his bat held high like many South Africans - and has a tendency to bring it down from second slip. The awkward manner in which he dealt with a James Kirtley bouncer against Sussex might also be examined by opponents. His team-mate Cameron White has certainly taken note of his ability to strike a clean ball. The Australian, who won the Sky Sports Sixes League last year, was recently asked who his rivals in the big hitting stakes might be this season. Remarkably, he mentioned Kieswetter in front of a more obvious colleague, Ian Blackwell. Kieswetter might be a batsman first and foremost but his keeping looks natural, even for one relatively tall for the role. In that Glamorgan match, when it was his turn behind the sticks, he took a stunning catch, leaping high one-handed to his right, to dismiss Alex Wharf off Peter Trego. Somerset's director of cricket, Brian Rose, immediately dubbed it \"world class\". He was right.
