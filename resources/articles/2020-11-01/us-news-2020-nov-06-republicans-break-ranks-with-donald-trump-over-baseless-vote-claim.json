With Trump\u2019s adult children, not least his sons Donald Jr and Eric, emerging with Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Guliani as some of the loudest cheerleaders for the false claim the election is being rigged, it has struggled to gain traction in the courts or among the wider Republican party thus far. Among close allies, South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham and the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, continued to cleave to Trump\u2019s frantic denials that he is on the verge of losing the White House. Many current and former Republicans, however, are concerned that Trump\u2019s attacks on the integrity of the election are dangerous, with a split emerging between those prepared to speak out and those staying silent. Inside the White House itself, a different debate is reported to have emerged, between a group of those close to Trump who believe he must be prepared for defeat \u2013 even if he refuses to formally concede \u2013 and a faction of bitter-enders who believe he should continue to fight through the courts. While some of those who have spoken out include familiar long-term Republican critics of Trump, such as Utah senator Mitt Romney, others have joined in. Maryland governor Larry Hogan, a second-term Republican who has not ruled out a 2024 White House bid, is prominent among them, describing the president\u2019s claims as \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cembarrassing\u201d. \u201cIf there are legitimate challenges, we have a process \u2013 that\u2019s the way it works,\u201d Hogan told the Associated Press. \u201cBut to just make accusations of the election being stolen and widespread fraud without providing any evidence, I thought was really bad for our democratic process and it was something I had never seen in my lifetime.\u201d Hogan\u2019s comment follows that of Illinois congressman Adam Kinzinger, who tweeted that the president\u2019s lying \u201cis getting insane\u201d and pleaded with his party to \u201cstop spreading debunked misinformation\u201d. Others pointed to the inconsistency of Trump\u2019s calls to stop counting in placing he was losing while continuing the count in other places including Missouri Republican senator, Roy Blunt. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop the count in one state and decide you want the count to continue in another state,\u201d Blunt said. \u201cThat might be how you\u2019d like to see the system work but that\u2019s not how the system works.\u201d That includes the Bush-era Republican strategist Karl Rove, who on Wednesday morning said the mass fraud that Trump is alleging was not going to happen in the US. \u201cSome hanky-panky always goes on, and there are already reports of poll watchers in Philadelphia not being allowed to do their jobs,\u201d Rove said. \u201cBut stealing hundreds of thousands of votes would require a conspiracy on the scale of a James Bond movie. That isn\u2019t going to happen. Let\u2019s repeat that: that isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d While Republican rebukes of the president are refreshing for many Democrats, it only comes as Trump\u2019s re-election campaign appears doomed. Biden took the lead in Georgia hours after the Wednesday address, and the Democratic challenger is on pace to flip Pennsylvania. As the president concluded his speech, former representative Carlos Curbelo called for \u201cRepublicans to stand up for our democracy at this hour\u201d. But as Republicans baselessly claim fraud publicly, at least one GOP official involved in the ballot-counting process has said behind closed doors that voter fraud was not an issue. Stuart Foster, a top state Republican official who trained ballot challengers in Michigan, told trainees just days before the election that he was \u201cconfident with our election system\u201d. Foster can be heard making the comments in a recording of the training session leaked to the Guardian. \u201cI\u2019ll get myself into trouble here. I basically made the comment like, so if fraud was so prevalent, then did the Democrats forget to do it in 2016? They just forgot to do it?\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, Trump \u2026 barely won. And it\u2019s not because he didn\u2019t win. [Democrats] just didn\u2019t show up. Did they just forget? Fraud was so prevalent, but they just forgot to do it?\u201d Meanwhile Trump has spent the past week being advised on his way forward by a coterie of familiar faces including former counsellor Kellyanne Conway, Giuliani, Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser and the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, who was recently diagnosed with coronavirus. Even those who believe a Biden presidency is a done deal are reportedly struggling how to convey the news to Trump. \u201cThey know he\u2019s lost,\u201d one Republican source told the Washington Post in a graphic depiction, \u201cbut no one seems willing to tell King Lear or Mad King George that they\u2019ve lost the empire.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
