The owner of the casino is London Clubs International, the stock market quoted group led by Michael Beckett. A deal could be announced within the next fortnight. It is understood that Planet Hollywood, which came out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US two months ago, is not directly involved in the move. Earl, a multimillionaire and confidante of retail entrepreneur Philip Green, has reportedly secured financial backing. London Clubs, which owns other casinos in the capital, such as Les Ambassadeurs, is keen to reduce debt after a slump in the group's fortunes since the terrorist attacks in September 2001. Last year, it reported that annual losses had doubled after write-offs relating to its investment in Aladdin, the Las Vegas casino which filed for bankruptcy protection last November. This year, Planet Hollywood was rumoured to be interested in a joint bid for Aladdin. \u00b7 The Government is to set out its policy on expansion of the casino industry after May's local elections. With regional development agencies, local authorities will gain the power to decide where casinos can operate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
