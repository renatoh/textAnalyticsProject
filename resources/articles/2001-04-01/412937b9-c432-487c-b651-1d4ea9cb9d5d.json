Tim Sherwood, Stephen Carr and Oyvind Leonhardsen, all long-term absentees, have been training all week while Sergei Rebrov has recovered from a hamstring strain. Glenn Hoddle is also hopeful that Ledley King, Steven Clemence and Sol Campbell will be fit for Old Trafford. \"Obviously they're very short on match practice,\" said Hoddle yesterday, \"so it's a question of whether they start, with a view to taking them off, or the other way round. But I think, whatever happens, there'll be a gamble on two or three of the players. It's a very difficult decision and it'll be a very late decision; I'll wait for some of these players even up to Saturday night.\" For Campbell he may wait even later. \"Sol is of vast importance,\" Hoddle said, \"especially with the way the Arsenal team are, all pace and power. The presence that Sol gives us, and his quality of play, would be a major bonus for us. He's improving but whether the game's going to come too quickly for the ankle to recover, I don't know. He's going to be touch and go.\" For Spurs, though, defeat is out of the question. \"It would take the whole team playing well to beat them,\" said Carr, \"but it makes you nervous even thinking about losing. Basically, our season's over if we don't win, it's as simple as that.\" The Arsenal manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, has given up hope of Dennis Bergkamp being fit. The Dutchman missed Saturday's win after damaging an achilles tendon and was not fit for Wednesday night's Champions League victory over Valencia. Wenger said: \"The scans on his foot do not look too bad but he still has pain and he won't be playing on Sunday. I fear he could also be short for our league game at Manchester City on Wednesday.\" Arsenal still have three strikers to choose from but, with Nwankwo Kanu again out of form against Valencia, it looks likely that they will start with the French international pairing of Thierry Henry and Sylvain Wiltord. \"If there are any changes, they will only be a few touches,\" Wenger said. The Cameroon midfielder Lauren, left out last night, could be recalled with the match-winner Ray Parlour moving to the right flank, but Ashley Cole is likely to keep the left-back spot ahead of the Brazilian Silvinho. Uefa has withdrawn a yellow card shown to Valencia's Roberto Ayala during Wednesday's Champions League defeat by Arsenal. The booking has been transferred to his team-mate Jocelyn Angloma, and Ayala will now be able to play in the second leg. Two former directors of Nottingham Forest Football Club face a legal bill in excess of \u00a32m after losing their high court battle to outlaw a \u00a36m cash injection deal for the First Division side. Irving Scholar, the former Tottenham chairman, and Julian Markham had claimed that the deal, which issued \u00a36m of shares to the international equity fund manager Nigel Doughty, devalued their 25% shareholding in the club and was an \"improper\" device to give Doughty control of the whole business. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
