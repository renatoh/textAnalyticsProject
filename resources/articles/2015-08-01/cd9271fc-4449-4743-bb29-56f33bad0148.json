At times weeping and gasping in the courtroom, the girl said Owen Labrie put a blanket down on the floor inside a mechanical room in the building and quickly turned their meeting into a painful sexual assault, biting her breasts and raping her as she froze in confusion and fear, saying no repeatedly but not trying to escape. A tradition of \u201csenior salutes\u201d at the school, in which senior boys or girls send romantic invitations to meet with younger students, dates back decades at St Paul\u2019s. Labrie, 19, who is from Vermont, faces multiple counts of rape, child endangerment and assault. He sat quietly in court during her testimony, sometimes scribbling notes. The girl told Labrie\u2019s attorney JW Carney Jr she had no recollection of telling one of her best friends at St Paul\u2019s school she would probably perform oral sex on Labrie, or allow digital penetration, when she accepted his invitation for a secret meeting last year known as a \u201csenior salute\u201d. \u201cI honestly have no recollection of saying that,\u201d she said. The girl told jurors she went to the rooftop with Labrie expecting only that they might kiss as part of his attempt to score points in an unofficial contest of sexual conquests. Carney, who gained a national profile when he represented Boston crime boss James \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger, presented the girl with a transcript of what her friend told police in Concord, New Hampshire. The friend told police the girl had said \u201cat most, I\u2019ll blow him\u201d. Carney then asked the alleged victim to explain what the term \u201cblow him\u201d means. Outside the courthouse, reporters asked the defense attorney, who says his client met the girl but did not have sex with her, if he worried how jurors might react to his approach handling such a young witness. \u201cI believe the jury will focus on the evidence. It doesn\u2019t matter the style of the lawyer,\u201d Carney said. Labrie claims he never raped the girl and that they engaged only in \u201cpetting\u201d and kissing. His attorney has told jurors he will testify. The girl testified she did not scream or kick Labrie during the encounter and laughed nervously when he ignored her distress. She claimed he said \u201cThat was fun\u201d after the assault and quickly exited the building while she gathered her clothes and struggled to walk downstairs because she was in pain. The alleged victim, who was raised in Tokyo, where her father worked until the family returned to the US when she was 12, said she never had sex before. \u201cI felt so scared. I had no idea what was going on. I\u2019d never been put in that situation before,\u201d she told the jury of 11 men and three women. The girl\u2019s father and other supporters sat in a front-row bench in the packed courtroom while Labrie\u2019s father sat in an adjacent front row. \u201cI tried to focus on the noises around me because I thought this will be over soon. Just wait it out \u2026 I didn\u2019t want to come off as an inexperienced little girl. I didn\u2019t want him to laugh at me. I didn\u2019t want to offend him. I didn\u2019t want to make him feel angry,\u201d she testified. The alleged victim testified she initially rejected LaBrie\u2019s \u201csenior salute\u201d. He beckoned her in a \u201cpretentious\u201d email to climb with him up a set of forbidden stairs and bask in a prized view of the campus. She said she thought the message was a form letter he sent to many girls in an effort to score in a game of conquests some boys played. She relented after LaBrie called her rejection \u201csassy\u201d and another boy convinced her she could trust LaBrie to behave. \u201cHe managed to convince me it was innocent \u2026 Owen wouldn\u2019t do anything against my will. I was thinking, wouldn\u2019t it be cool to see such a cool place?\u201d The girl testified she never tried to leave during the alleged assault and felt like she was \u201coutside of my body\u201d. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to cause a conflict. I didn\u2019t want to come off as bitchy. I didn\u2019t want to cause any trouble. I didn\u2019t want to have that reputation,\u201d she said. She later told friends: \u201cI think I just had sex with Owen Labrie.\u201d She said she blamed herself during the incident for agreeing to meet him. \u201cI\u2019m thinking how naive \u2026 how I never should have left my room that night. I never should have gone. If I had just been able to kick, or yell at him \u2026 If I had been able to get the point across \u2026 I could have stopped it,\u201d she said. Her first instinct not to \u201ccause a confrontation\u201d by reporting she was raped turned into a desire for justice, she said, when Labrie later sent her messages denying he performed sex acts on her. \u201cWhen a boy actually takes your virginity, I hope it\u2019s golden,\u201d he wrote to her. The message shocked her into accepting she had been raped, she testified. \u201cThe fact he was backtracking and trying to protect himself made me realize, oh my God, I had every right to be upset,\u201d she said. She waited until after her older sister\u2019s graduation to tell her family about the incident because she didn\u2019t want to tarnish her sister\u2019s big day, she said. \u201cI was not about to make this weekend about me. No way would I do that. In my head I thought that was too selfish. I thought: my parents don\u2019t need to worry about this right now,\u201d she said. She asked the school nurse for a Plan B pill to prevent unwanted pregnancy and falsely told the nurse the sex was consensual because she did not want the nurse to have to make a report, she said. She also recalled scrubbing herself in the shower after the alleged assault. \u201cI was crying in the shower. I felt like something had just been taken away from me, yet I still thought it was my fault. I should have done more,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
