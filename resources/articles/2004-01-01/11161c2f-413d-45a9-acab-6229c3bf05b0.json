Northern Ireland's specialist registrars - the most senior grade of junior hospital doctor - and consultants today joined their colleagues in England, Scotland and Wales in backing new terms and conditions. Almost 84% of senior hospital doctors in the province supported the contract, which will require consultants to devote three-quarters of their time to direct NHS patient care but also reaffirms their right to treat private patients. Of the 1,484 ballot papers sent out to hospital doctors in Northern Ireland only 842 were returned. The result showed that 702 (83.6%) of those who voted backed the proposed deal, compared to 138 (16.4%) who opposed it. The chairman of the BMA's Northern Ireland consultants committee, Kanwar Panesar, said: \"This is a good contract for patients and consultants. \"We are optimistic that it will help with the recruitment and retention of consultants within the NHS in Northern Ireland; it should also help boost the morale of our workforce and this can only be better for our patients.\" Dr Paul Devine, the chairman of the BMA's Northern Ireland junior doctors committee, added: \"I believe that this new contract will go some way in encouraging specialist registrars to take up consultant posts within the NHS in Northern Ireland.\" The ratification process follows the negotiation of separate contracts by each of the BMA branches in the devolved UK countries for the first time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
