The league also announced that it will accelerate \u00a3125m due to the EFL and National League, although a large portion of that is parachute payments to individual clubs previously relegated from the top flight, not for distribution to stricken smaller clubs. A \u00a320m contribution is also going to be made, the league said in its statement, \u201cto support the NHS, communities, families and vulnerable groups during the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d. That will include a direct contribution to the NHS and more money for clubs\u2019 own community outreach programmes. The decisions followed an intense week of meetings between the Premier League, EFL and the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, as well as discussions between the 20 club captains, in a climate of increasing criticism of players for not having taken pay cuts, including by the health secretary, Matt Hancock. Separately, players themselves are discussing how best to make substantial donations to the NHS, which was aired in a meeting between the captains of all 20 clubs, in which Liverpool\u2019s Jordan Henderson was a significant influence. There is some frustration within football at Hancock \u2013 who made a connection between Premier League players \u201cplaying their part\u201d by taking a pay cut and NHS doctors and nurses who have died treating Covid\u201119 patients \u2013 and other politicians who have made footballers a target of criticism during the crisis. That was largely the result of the Tottenham chairman, Daniel Levy, this week announcing that Spurs\u2019 non-playing staff had taken a 20% pay cut and been placed on the government\u2019s furlough scheme, which pays laid-off people 80% of their salary up to a maximum \u00a32,500 per month, while agreements had not yet been reached with players or the PFA. Clubs will not ask players to take a 30% cut in their annual wage immediately; the figure is understood to be the total for a worst-case scenario, equating to the Premier League clubs themselves losing that amount of their annual revenues if the season cannot be finished. The clubs have already lost significant income for the matches which have not been played, and have effectively ground to a halt. However, the clubs have not yet lost the \u00a3750m TV income covering the remaining matches, and restated their determination to get the season finished \u201cwith the full support of government and when medical guidance allows\u201d. With the league having assessed its potential losses for different possible outcomes, the 30% is understood to be made up of 10% potentially lost in matchday income and 20% from broadcasters, if the season is not finished. In its statement, the Premier League said: \u201cIn the face of substantial and continuing losses for the 2019-20 season since the suspension of matches began, and to protect employment throughout the professional game, Premier League clubs unanimously agreed to consult their players regarding a combination of conditional reductions and deferrals amounting to 30% of total annual remuneration.\u201d Further talks on the issue are due to be held on Saturday involving the PFA, Premier League, players and club representatives. The PFA and its long-serving chief executive, Gordon Taylor, have been holding to the line that in principle they want to discuss only the deferral of wages rather than actual cuts, and for clubs to show the union the detailed financial evidence to justify the savings required. On Thursday the union said in a statement that it objected to clubs putting non-playing staff on furlough if they could afford to pay them, but suggested that players\u2019 wages could be used to pay staff if that was genuinely necessary. The Premier League has been seeking to impress on Taylor all week the haemorrhaging of money clubs are experiencing and could be facing if the season is not completed, or, even if it is, in the scenario of matches having to be played behind closed doors. In Levy\u2019s announcement, he emphasised that Spurs, like all clubs, have no revenues during the suspension. The League Managers\u2019 Association also made a statement saying that \u201cthe vast majority of clubs, particularly in the EFL, are already utilising the government\u2019s \u2026 scheme, furloughing staff where there is no work available\u201d. The LMA said that managers and coaches had also agreed, \u201con a club by club basis \u2026 furloughs, cuts and deferrals\u201d. The Premier League confirmed that matches will not resume, as previously hoped, at the beginning of May, and the FA said in a statement that the Women\u2019s Super League and Women\u2019s Championship will not do so either."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
