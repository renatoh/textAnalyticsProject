He's joined by subtle pianist Tim Lapthorn, and the unobtrusively propulsive rhythm section of Mick Hutton on bass and Matt Skelton on drums. Kemp has an attractively burry and substantial sound (lustrous in his favoured middle register, hinting at a mix of Stan Getzian breeziness and Coltrane's imploring cry), swinging purposefully over Lapthorn's cajoling chords and the rhythm section's cool grooving. Sly and slinky Pear Juice is a classic bebop vehicle on which Kemp and Lapthorn unfold imperturbable inventions over Hutton's loping walk and Skelton's cymbal flutter. The playfully Latin-swaying Posy for Rosie dances over a catchy piano hook, Kemp shows his standards-playing sensitivity on an elegant All of You, and the punchy finale Six Steps is a sparky piece of soul-jazz. The versatile leader is devoted to acoustic instruments and a keen studio techie, too, so the warm and rounded sound of this set is one of its significant virtues \u2013 even if a lot of the music sounds very familiar."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
