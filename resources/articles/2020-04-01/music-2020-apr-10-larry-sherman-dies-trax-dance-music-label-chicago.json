The news was confirmed by the current head of Trax, Rachael Cain, via Facebook. Producer Marshall Jefferson was among those paying tribute, writing on social media: \u201cRIP \u2026 sending love.\u201d Sherman was originally a collector of vintage jukeboxes, and, frustrated with the limited range of records, he bought Music Products, a pressing plant in Bridgeport, Illinois, to press up tracks for them. \u201cI got tired of listening to the Andrew Sisters and Tommy Dorsey,\u201d he once said. \u201cSo I decided to do things the hard way.\u201d He was then approached by house music artists Jesse Saunders and Vince Lawrence who wanted him to release their music. He pressed up Saunders\u2019 On and On \u2013 regarded by some as the first house music record \u2013 and created the Precision label, before founding Trax. Via Trax, Sherman released the futuristic, bass-driven music that defined Chicago house style, such as Can U Feel It by Mr Fingers, Your Love by Frankie Knuckles, Bringing Down the Walls by Robert Owens, and Jefferson\u2019s Move Your Body. Phuture\u2019s Acid Tracks was released by the label and helped coin the term \u201cacid house\u201d, which caused a sensation in the UK in 1988. Sherman was criticised for poor-quality vinyl pressings, missed royalty payments, and a lack of interaction with the artists on his roster. \u201cThere could be a house music convention here and no one on Trax would say to you, \u2018You guys should come\u2019,\u201d house producer Merwyn Sanders told the Guardian in 2011. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realise there was a following in Europe. Up until a year ago, we were clueless.\u201d DJ Pierre of Phuture once claimed \u201cTrax never paid me royalties\u201d, and Jamie Principle, who sang Your Love, alleged he wasn\u2019t properly signed to the label, saying they \u201cliterally just stole my stuff\u201d. In a 2014 statement, the former creative director Jorge Cruz acknowledged the numerous disputes, saying: \u201cThe reality is that the Trax Records name is making money but much of the money is not reaching the label or the artists. We cannot change the past or the legal battles that are tied to it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
