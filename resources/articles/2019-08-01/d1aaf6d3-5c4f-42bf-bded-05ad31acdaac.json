Wyatt, the Labor senator Patrick Dodson and the Cape York leader Noel Pearson were all invited to be panellists on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program on Monday, but none attended. The Labor MP Linda Burney and the APY Lands chairwoman, Sally Scales, criticised Wyatt, four days after he said in the annual Lingiari lecture that a constitutionally enshrined Indigenous voice to parliament would not be considered as part of a referendum on constitutional recognition. Instead he said he would take a \u201cpragmatic\u201d approach foreshadowed in a joint select committee report last year, and in his press club speech last month. Enshrining a representative First Nations body in the constitution was one of two key recommendations of the landmark Uluru Statement. Burney, the shadow Indigenous affairs spokeswoman, said Labor supported the Uluru Statement in full but she would continue to work with Wyatt in a bipartisan way. She said she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that \u201cKen made the decision \u2013 someone made the decision \u2013 that Ken wasn\u2019t appearing\u201d on Q&amp;A, but that only he could explain why he felt a First Nations advisory body should not have constitutional protection. Scales said Wyatt\u2019s position pushed the debate on constitutional recognition back to 2015, before the idea of a symbolic reform was soundly rejected by national community dialogues. \u201cWe have had eight reports in eight years around constitutional recognition in one form or another,\u201d Scales said. \u201cDo we want to wait another eight years? Do we need another eight reports?\u201d Asked by host Tony Jones if she or other delegates who signed off on the Uluru Statement in 2017 would be prepared to compromise, Scales said: \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWe have compromised so much already,\u201d she said. \u201cAs Indigenous Australians, as First Nations people, we have compromised a lot. So why do we have to keep compromising?\u201d Liberal senator Julian Leeser, who co-chaired a joint select committee, said Wyatt and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, both supported a referendum and an Indigenous voice to parliament, just not combining the two. He would not comment when asked if Wyatt had been told not to advocate for a constitutionally enshrined voice. Leeser, a leading constitutional conservative, has advocated support for the Uluru Statement and said he remained \u201ccommitted to constitutional recognition that involves recognition of some form of consultative mechanism for Indigenous people.\u201d Both Leeser and Burney said the next step of the process, the co-design of the voice between government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, should be the urgent priority. \u201cWe should celebrate the fact that we have got a commitment to constitutional recognition and that\u2019s a bipartisan position, and we have a commitment to a voice and that\u2019s a bipartisan position, and we\u2019ve got a commitment to co-design.\u201d Leeser said. Alice Springs councillor Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, also on the panel, said the debate was a \u201cdistraction\u201d from grassroots issues like high rates of Indigenous suicide and family violence. The chief executive of the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, Patricia Turner, rejected that suggestion. \u201cWell, it hasn\u2019t distracted me,\u201d Turner said. \u201cWe\u2019re working very hard to close the gap and to ensure that Aboriginal voices are at the table in negotiations with government as equals.\u201d Burney said the debate was not \u201ca zero-sum game.\u201d \u201cThis is not about a voice as opposed to social justice issues,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is about both of those things at the same time.\u201d Burney, Turner and Scales said the government needed to \u201cget on with it\u201d. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave this for another generation to have the same discussion about a permanent, secure voice to the Australian parliament, representing the views of First Nations people,\u201d Burney said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
