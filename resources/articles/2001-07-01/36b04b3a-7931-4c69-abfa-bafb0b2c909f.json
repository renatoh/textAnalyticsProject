Hitzfeld figured high on United's shortlist after leading Bayern to their third Bundesliga title in a row and the European Cup last season, but in an interview with the German magazine Focus he said there was little chance of him moving to Old Trafford. \"I don't think I would do that,\" he said. \"If I move again then it will be only within Germany. It may be difficult to find a new challenge here but there are still a few interesting clubs.\" Although Hitzfeld, who also won the European Cup with Borussia Dortmund in 1997, went on to reveal that he \"does not like to make definite plans more than a year ahead\", he is not prone to making rash statements. At 52 he is giving serious consideration to retiring when his contract expires in 2004. \"Maybe I will give up training altogether and just work as a television expert. That's a very appealing prospect.\" His pronouncement will strengthen the feeling in the United boardroom that, rather than pursuing a foreign manager, they should make a concerted attempt to lure O'Neill from Celtic when Ferguson's 16-year tenure ends next June. Hector Cuper, who has moved from Valencia to Internazionale this summer, and Leeds United's David O'Leary have also been discussed but O'Neill and Hitzfeld carried most favour. United, meanwhile, have agreed a \u00a32.5m fee with Wigan Athletic for their Northern Ireland goalkeeper Roy Carroll. Ferguson has assured the 23-year-old that although he will be Fabien Barthez's understudy he will be the second choice ahead of Raimond van der Gouw and can expect to make at least 15 first-team appearances this season. Carroll has therefore turned down Everton and if all goes to plan he will complete the move within two weeks. \"The clubs have reached a gentlemen's agreement and we expect everything to be finalised when United return from their tour of the far east,\" his agent Francis Martin said. \"We are waiting for a call to let us know the date of the medical. Roy will continue to train with Wigan but everything is all but done.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
