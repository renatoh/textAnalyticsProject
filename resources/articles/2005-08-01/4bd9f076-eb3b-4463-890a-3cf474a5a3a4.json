You'd see a top, some shoes or even a bag in a magazine or on television, and remember it or rip the page out. At the weekend you'd go to the shops, try it on and think about whether to buy it. Maybe you'd go back the following weekend and complete your purchase. But those days are long gone. The waiting list phenomenon is coming soon to a high street near you - if it isn't there already.These lists are a barometer of taste - if something's on there, you should want it in your wardrobe. It's hot. Currently four national high street stores - New Look, Primark, Reiss and French Connection - are keeping a register of shoppers' names for certain 'highly prized' products. In fact, actually getting your hands on one of these items is almost as enjoyable as wearing the thing itself. But bear in mind you'll be waiting between one week and two months, depending on what you have your eye on. Nowadays fashion fiends have to be quick because everyone's a fashionista. This is the age of the waiting list - and if you thought that sort of thing was the sole preserve of ladies who lunch and spend thousands of pounds on London's Bond Street or Glasgow's Italian Centre, you'd be mistaken. It's no longer just a case of putting your name down for that Stella McCartney medallion bag, as carried by the lady herself, or those Yves Saint Laurent platform loafers. Those in the know are now on the list for the new \u00a312 sequinned racing-back vest from Primark or the highly coveted navy blue belted cape from New Look, as well as a pair of Chloe slouch boots. And if you want a dress from Topshop's bespoke 'Atelier' service - whereby you can get a dress made exactly to your specifications for just over \u00a3100 - you'll be waiting until December for an appointment. It all began late last year when womenswear store Oasis had a month-long waiting list for its look-alike version of Mulberry's Roxanne bag. At any one time, the list was 120 names long. Customers were offering shell-shocked sales assistants double the retail price just to get their hands on one of the bags. Why has our appetite for certain clothes suddenly become so insatiable? Analyst Anika Sorensen from Trendcentral believes it's due to increased awareness of what's on the high streets and what's in vogue - so-called 'style intelligence'. 'Twenty years ago, people read monthly magazines, newspapers weren't riddled with style articles and there weren't the kinds of makeover or fashion shows on the television we have today. The internet and this whole celebrity culture didn't exist.' Monthly and weekly women's fashion magazines, with their 'must haves' and 'buys of the week', play a major part in whipping up demand - something high street shops are only too happy to cater for. These chain stores are also very quick at getting designer replicas on the rails - sometimes in a matter of days - meaning there is more to buy and at cheaper prices. 'The waiting list is certainly a new phenomenon on the high street,' says Helen Penny, spokesperson for the budget high street shop Primark. 'You'd expect it with Chloe or Mulberry - products which have a limited range. This sort of thing has only happened over the past year. We had a huge waiting list for our \u00a310 sequinned shrug.' Designers are also feeling the pressure. 'Everyone wants new things all the time,' says Phoebe Philo at Chloe. 'Shops require so much.' Even the famous can't always sidestep the list. Sources say the fashionista's fashionista, Kate Moss, added her name to the long waiting list at Marc Jacobs in New York last week for one of their gold crochet necklaces. There are just some things no amount of money can buy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
