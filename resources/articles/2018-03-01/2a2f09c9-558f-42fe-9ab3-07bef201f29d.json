The cowardly Roman soldier Brutus has done a runner with his spaced-out friend Philo, realising his flimsy cover story is about to be blown. Queen Kerra has aided the escape of young Cait and her father, telling the young girl that she is \u201cthe one\u201d, but elaborating no further. This episode is an Antedia, Aulus and Kerra-free zone and, I must admit, I missed them. Phelan and Ania\u2019s joyless humping is no substitute for Aulus and Kerra\u2019s mutual nostril-flaring or Zo\u00eb Wanamaker\u2019s profligate swearing. Like two raspberry puddings Cait unwisely removes the bandages from her dad\u2019s eyes to see how they\u2019re healing, but is horrified to see his bloodied hollow sockets staring back at her. What did she think was under there? New eyeballs? She dodges her dad\u2019s questions about what is going on and why they were being chased by a slavering man-beast. \u201cI may be blind,\u201d he says at the beginning of nearly every sentence, but not daft, clearly. The two make for what I think was once their home village before the Romans charged in and ruined it all. And we shall spend the bulk of this episode there, going between the huts occupied by Brutus and Philo, and Ania and Phelan. By Puica\u2019s nostrils Puica, in the form of Divis, strides through the forest, sniffing the air on the trail of the chosen one. He spends the whole of this episode stalking Cait and then biding his time outside her hut, thinking of despicable ways to trick her. When he finally appears in the guise of her dead sister Islene, you wonder why he doesn\u2019t just do the slavering man-beast bit and kill her like he did those Roman soldiers, in bits all over the forest floor, last week. Phelan and Ania/Brenna, goddess of war, stop in the forest for a delicious meal of grass, mud, beetles and badger shit, and Ania can\u2019t understand why her new boyfriend isn\u2019t enjoying it. \u201cDoes my cooking not please you?\u201d she asks with a straight face. He retorts that he\u2019s never crapped so much in his life thanks to her \u201ccooking\u201d. He points out very perceptively that she is not \u201cBrenna, goddess of dinner\u201d and she has to agree. Brutus and Philo have also arrived in the vicinity and make their way to the village. The call of nature Cait\u2019s dad quizzes her over the queen\u2019s words as they leave the citadel. (\u201cYou are the one,\u201d is pretty unequivocal, no?) Little do they know that Puica/Divis has caught up with them and is standing feet away at the gates of the village, pausing dramatically to pronounce: \u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d in his trademark mad whisper. Meanwhile, Brutus has found the local witch-doctor\u2019s drug basement and goes to town trying his wares. He and Philo, who eventually awakes from his trance, spend the rest of this episode getting stoned and talking bollocks like a less amusing Bill and Ted. \u201cSo, beheading your best mate. What set you off down that particular road?\u201d ventures Brutus to his still-mute friend, trying to get anything at all out of him. In Ania and Phelan\u2019s hut, the thatch is shaking to the rhythm of their desolate humping, and they seem unaware of the drama unfolding across the clearing. Puica digs up Islene\u2019s body, breathes life back into it and takes on her form to trick Cait, but she is having none of it. \u201cYou\u2019re not my sister,\u201d she snarls at the apparition. Philo concludes that the gods might be \u201cbollocks\u201d and thus discovers atheism. \u201cWe are alone, Brutus,\u201d he says with sudden sobriety and some gravity. His existential crisis begins in earnest. With Puica gone, Divis tells Cait he was wrong about her, but has trouble saying the word. \u201cIt is my mission to protect you,\u201d he informs her, little believing it himself. He says she must destroy Loka with his help. Our stoned Roman friends try to grasp the thread of conversation again, but it slips beyond reach and they go outside to stare at the moon. \u201cAll hail Luna,\u201d they sigh. \u201cMay she always protect us.\u201d That atheism didn\u2019t last long. Notes from the end of the woad Those long shots of the river valley covered in mist really are beautiful and conjure an ancient time of myth and superstition. This show can look so lovely, from a distance. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about heads,\u201d says Philo, quite understandably, to Brutus, referring to the friend he beheaded while high in an earlier episode. \u201cThese things happen,\u201d says Brutus. Oh, all the time. The trippy visual effects (Gene Simmons\u2019 tongue, etc) in the stoner scene sat very oddly in a show where characters are often high on some twig or another, but these visual tricks are absent. The tongue was funny, though. I am unconvinced by the needless delay in all these demon kings actually fighting each other. Ooh, I\u2019ll appear before you but then I\u2019ll go again because IT IS NOT YET TIME. Get on with it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
