The owner of Heathrow said it would use the proceeds to repay borrowings it is struggling to refinance. Its majority shareholder, the Spanish construction group Ferrovial, admitted last month that regulatory rulings had introduced a \"high degree of risk\" into its refinancing plans by potentially cutting its cashflow from London airports. Some of the pressure was relieved yesterday when BAA said it had sold its interests in six Australian airports to a financial buyer, Melbourne-based Hastings Fund Management. BAA said: \"The sale represents a continuation of BAA's strategy to dispose of non-core international assets.\" It also owns airport management and retail contracts in the US. BAA's refinancing plans had been sent back to the drawing board after the Competition Commission said the airport owner should receive a lower rate of return from Heathrow and Gatwick. The Civil Aviation Authority is expected to confirm the cut in a final ruling in March. Return on capital at Heathrow would fall from 7.75% to 6.2% and at Gatwick from 7.75% to 6.5%. Credit rating agency Standard and Poor's put the group on \"Creditwatch\" as the City feared it could lose \u00a3150m a year by the move. Stephen Nelson, BAA chief executive, warned the ruling would endanger the \u00a33.5bn redevelopment of Heathrow's Terminal 1 and 2. Ferrovial executives have questioned whether a third runway would still be financially viable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
