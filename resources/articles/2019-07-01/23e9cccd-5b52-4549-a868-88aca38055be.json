He still yearns to feel the heat of competition at the highest level of men\u2019s tennis again and has seen nothing during his time away from the tour to make him think he is incapable of challenging Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. By the same token, however, the former world No 1 acknowledges he has a different perspective on triumph and despair six months after career-saving hip surgery. Murray has no desire to experience all that pain again. He will not rush his return to singles action and, after impressing alongside Serena Williams in a polished 7-5, 6-3 mixed doubles win over Fabrice Martin and Raquel Atawo in front of an enraptured Centre Court audience, revealed that it is doubtful it will come at the US Open in August. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty unlikely just in terms of timing,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI spoke to my team a bit about that yesterday. There\u2019s just a lot of stuff I need to get done physically, get myself stronger. The amount of work I need to do on the court to get ready for singles, the amount of work I need to put in off the court to get myself strong enough to play best-of-five sets, it\u2019s still quite a way away unfortunately. \u201cI would love to play. I need to look pretty long-term with this. I don\u2019t want to be having to go through another big operation in a few years. I want to make sure the operation I\u2019ve had lasts for as long as possible. To give it the best chance, I need to make sure that I\u2019m physically really strong before I get back on the singles court.\u201d All the battle scars tell Murray there is no need to force it now. \u201cI said this at the beginning of the grass season: I don\u2019t want to put a timeframe on it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou guys want a timeframe. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take for me to physically get to that level. \u201cI know some people might like it to have taken five months or six months but it\u2019s going to take more time than that. Whether that\u2019s nine months or 12 months or 18 months, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll do my best to make it as soon as I can.\u201d Murray added that he does not intend to travel to the States to play any of the smaller tournaments before the US Open. Indeed he is yet to decide how to play it after Wimbledon. \u201cI want to try to prepare and get ready for singles,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m able to train the way that I need to off the court and still maintain my performance on it in doubles, I would consider that. But I don\u2019t know if I want to go over to the States to play doubles for four or five weeks. I\u2019ll decide on that probably when the tournament [Wimbledon] is done. But having felt how I felt these last few weeks, I\u2019m positive about the future, so therefore I\u2019m going to train properly to try and give singles a go. \u201cWhen I got my hip injury, I was ranked No 1 in the world,\u201d he said after reaching the third round of the mixed doubles alongside Williams on Tuesday night. \u201cI went from playing at the highest level of the sport to really struggling to do day-to-day things. \u201cFirst of all playing tennis was not fun any more because it was painful every time I played. The training and stuff wasn\u2019t great. Then I wasn\u2019t enjoying just going out for a walk. Going out for dinner and things like that, it was just uncomfortable. \u201cNow that I\u2019m pain-free again, I realise that\u2019s actually the most important thing. I\u2019m just doing the things I\u2019ve always loved doing again, which I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to do much the last couple of years.\u201d For the time being the focus is on Wimbledon. And the good news is that Murray\u2019s understanding with Williams was in fine working order during their win over Atawo and Martin, the 14th seeds. Ever the perfectionist Murray was annoyed with himself for failing to convert a few break points \u2013 \u201csomething you get better with playing more matches,\u201d he said \u2013 but Williams hit winners for fun. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that was once in a lifetime, \u201c she beamed. \u201cI just never hit returns like that in my life.\u201d They appear to be having a lot of fun together. Even if they are desperate to win this tournament \u2013 an ambition that will be severely tested when they face the top seeds, Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar, on Wednesday\u2013 there are enough moments of levity to keep everyone entertained. Sir Andy was asked if his esteemed teammate should get an honorary damehood if Team SerAndy win Wimbledon. While Williams blushed, Murray observed her embarrassment with mild amusement. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he drawled."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
