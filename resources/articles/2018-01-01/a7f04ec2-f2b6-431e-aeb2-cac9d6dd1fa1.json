But there\u2019s also seething post-punk that recalls early Fugazi, and the lyrics \u2013 full of blood, spunk and dirt \u2013 are far too jaded and contradictory to make for easy indie-disco fodder. They\u2019re delivered by supremely charismatic frontman Charlie Steen, pitching his delivery between Bullingdon and borstal. As well as his brilliantly smart-arse stream of consciousness on The Lick, the peak is the single One Rizla, where teenage gripes and insecurities cohere into grownup emotional clarity, Steen yelling \u201cyou\u2019re clinging to conflict / just let go!\u201d as a massive anthem surges behind him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
