Writer-director Sadia Saeed\u2019s protagonist Arifa (Shermin Hassan) is a frustrated 28-year-old British Asian woman who works in insurance and lives at home with her parents. Scenes float by with a weird lack of urgency that doesn\u2019t appear to be a conscious choice, jokes are muffled, and some of the performers fail to convince. The film can\u2019t work as comedy, because the material isn\u2019t up to snuff. As a character study, it struggles to wring much of note out of a heroine who may simply be too ordinary. The odd thing is that Saeed seems aware of this shortcoming, working in scenes in which Arifa\u2019s fumbling attempts at creative writing are offered a no-nonsense critique by her tutor. One of the latter\u2019s observations \u2013 \u201cThis isn\u2019t a story; it\u2019s a magazine article\u201d \u2013 reverberates loudly through the slice-of-life snapshots that follow, yet even a student-rag profile would demand more connective tissue than Saeed\u2019s script provides. A naggingly unpersuasive strand involving Dad\u2019s illegal tobacco smuggling operation generates less tension than the matter of which unworthy suitor our girl can shake off first. That quandary, in turn, becomes secondary to minor disputes in newsagents and aerobics classes. By far the film\u2019s strongest suit is Hassan\u2019s bright and likable performance, revealing an inner spark that makes the character less of a pushover than she initially seems. It may serve this performer well should she get her hands on more fortified, lived-in writing. A sparse piano score, by Level 42\u2019s Mike Lindup, adds a note or two of atmosphere, and cinematographer Giuseppe Pignone collates some attractive glimpses of Soho at Christmas and out-of-season Brighton. Yet too often what\u2019s going on registers as humdrum in the extreme. At the risk of sounding like that creative writing tutor, it\u2019s the kind of drama you might experience walking past an open door."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
