Then dig out your swimming costume and head to the temporary lido opening next week in south-east London as part of the London festival of Architecture. The French architecture collective EXYZT have sought inspiration in Roman baths and Turkish hammams to create a lido, sauna and paddling pool, along with beach huts, sun deck, bar and garden, all on a derelict building site in Southwark. As well as swimming, there will be informal music concerts and evening poolside film screenings. \"We want to encourage people to leave their desks and to come and have a drink or bathe, as well as to think of the city in a different way,\" says festival curator Elias Redstone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
