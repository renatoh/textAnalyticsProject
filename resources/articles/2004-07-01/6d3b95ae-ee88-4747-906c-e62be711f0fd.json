At the other you had Chris DiMarco in sotto voce tailoring - tan shirt and blue rain pants, flapping open at the cuffs. From Kings Road, Chelsea, to Scruffy Links, Anywhere. Yesterday, for the second round of the Open Championship at Royal Troon, Poulter was a tad more sedate and DiMarco was a bit hipper, his bags having finally arrived. Wherever DiMarco finishes, put him down as man of the match or, at the very least, American man of the match. Despite arriving late on Wednesday after two anxious days of delays, with no bags, little sleep and no practice at Royal Troon, he went out and shot himself a par in the first round - and that included a triple bogey. He was still moving along nicely in the second round yesterday as fellow Americans - former dominators of the Open - were trying to find a place in the sun for themselves. It went dark for Ben Curtis, the defending champion. He missed the cut. John Daly, Class of '95, opened with a 70 but blew to a 78 and also flunked, as did Tom Lehman ('96) and Mark O'Meara ('98). New hats came into the ring, most notably that of Kenny Perry, aged 43, who shot 70 for a 139 total and then apologised to himself for not coming over here sooner. But DiMarco remains the hero, if a quiet one. He shot that par 71 in the first round and offered: \"I played really well. I made some great up-and-downs. I made a couple of good birdies coming in but I made a bad triple [bogey] on No11, where I hit it on the wrong side.\" As they say on the streets, that ain't the half of it. DiMarco's tale begins at Philadelphia International Airport, where his Monday evening flight to Glasgow was delayed because someone earlier had stuffed a blanket down a toilet. Planes are not allowed to fly unless all their systems are working properly. Repairmen worked feverishly at the problem while DiMarco and his fellow passengers sat around in the terminal from 8.30 until they boarded the plane at 3am. By then, however, the flight crew had exceeded legal time limits for flying. The passengers were disembarked at 4am and scattered to various hotels. When last seen, DiMarco was dragging luggage off a carousel overloaded and jammed. The next chapter finds him on a plane scheduled to go to Heathrow on Tuesday evening. An electrical failure kept that plane grounded for three hours. When it did leave, shortly after midnight, it was too late to let him catch his shuttle connection to Glasgow. Thus DiMarco finally arrived at Troon at about 6.30pm on Wednesday with his clubs but without his clothes, with very little sleep and no practice. Yet he still made it to his fifth Open and shot his second-best opening round. Perry, meanwhile, celebrated his third Open with an eagle two on the first hole on Thursday, and after he had completed a 69-70 for 139 yesterday he scolded himself for not having played the Open Championship earlier, sounding like the evangelist penitent. \"I'm not playing for the money any more,\" he said. \"I'm playing for history. I kind of forget what it was all about there in the middle of the 90s, when I was playing pretty good golf. Maybe I made too much money. I don't know what it was, but for some reason I didn't come over here.\" Apart from the money, there was family with three growing kids. \"When I look back I could kick myself, because I've had so much fun whenever I've come over,\" he said. \"I didn't realise what I was missing.\" He missed the cut in 1991, tied for eighth at Royal St George's last year, and now figures he is getting the hang of links golf. As he said: \"Now I just want a little piece of history.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
