Spence was hospitalized and listed in critical condition after flipping his Ferrari while traveling \u201cat a high rate of speed\u201d northbound on Riverfront Boulevard near Interstate 80 just before 3am, but managed to escape the accident with no broken bones despite not wearing a seatbeat and getting thrown from the vehicle. \u201cMr Spence has been released from the hospital and will need to address those charges,\u201d a Dallas police spokesperson said in a statement to the Guardian on Wednesday. \u201cAs for getting a speed of the vehicle, we will not be getting one. It was a single car accident with no other criminal charges.\u201d Spence, a 2012 US Olympian and native of the Dallas suburb of DeSoto, is widely regarded as one of the world\u2019s best pound-for-pound boxers. He unified the IBF and WBC welterweight championships with a thrilling split-decision victory over Shawn Porter last month in Los Angeles, improving his professional record to 26-0 with 21 knockouts and cementing himself as a pay-per-view attraction. He first won the IBF title with an 11th-round knockout of Kell Brook at Bramall Lane in May 2017."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
