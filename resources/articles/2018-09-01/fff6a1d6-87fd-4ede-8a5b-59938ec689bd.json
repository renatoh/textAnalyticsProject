PHE\u2019s tie-up with Drinkaware for an alcohol-free days campaign prompted the resignation of its alcohol adviser, Sir Ian Gilmore, last week. The agency went ahead with the campaign despite the concerns of 46 experts, including Prof Gilmore, about cooperating with a charity mostly funded by alcohol companies. Three of the experts have since claimed Drinkaware\u2019s website appears to support dangerous levels of alcohol consumption. The authors \u2013 Prof Mark Petticrew and Prof Martin McKee from the Faculty of Public Health and Policy at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Dame Theresa Marteau from the University of Cambridge Behaviour and Health Research Unit \u2013 said the website appeared to have confused daily and weekly drinking guidelines. They accused Drinkaware of \u201cdisseminating messages that could mislead the public about the risk of cancer from alcohol consumption, using strategies similar to the tobacco and other industries\u201d. They also claimed the drink-free days campaign, launched earlier this month, is ineffective and distracts from tougher but proven methods of cutting alcohol consumption. \u201cDrinkaware\u2019s approach \u2026 typically focus[es] on pathological drinking patterns while avoiding or misrepresenting evidence on measures known to work, including pricing, marketing, and availability controls,\u201d they wrote. \u201cDrinkaware\u2019s alcohol self-assessment tool on their website seems to endorse heavy drinking. For example, a 30-year-old man who drinks seven units a day, every day \u2013 over three times the current guidelines for low-risk drinking \u2013 receives the advice: \u2018If you continue drinking at this level and do not exceed the daily guidelines then you are drinking in a way that is unlikely to harm your health. Drinking consistently within these limits is called lower risk rather than safe, because drinking alcohol is never completely safe\u2019.\u201d In response, PHE said such examples \u201cshow the Drinkaware website needs a full audit, which we are discussing with Drinkaware\u201d. But writing in the Lancet medical journal, John Newton, PHE\u2019s director of health improvement, and Paul Cosford, the medical director, continued to defend the tie-up with Drinkaware. \u201cAs a national public health agency, our primary consideration is our duty to protect and improve health. We consider that duty is best served in this case by working with Drinkaware on their campaign,\u201d they wrote. Newton and Cosford claimed the tie-up had allowed PHE to \u201cimprove and inform the work of another body already active in alcohol education\u201d. Petticrew, McKee and Marteau, meanwhile, urged PHE to develop a code of practice on its relationship with industry in order to maintain credibility. Newton and Cosford defended the agency\u2019s other links with industry. \u201cOur successful experience of working closely with the food industry in England on reformulation to reduce salt, sugar and calories in the national diet has been based on a clear understanding that we set standards that we expect the industry to meet, and that we monitor independently,\u201d PHE said. A Drinkaware spokeswoman said it strongly rebutted the claim that its website endorsed heavy drinking. She said the charity\u2019s self-assessment tool used the alcohol use disorder identification test created by the World Health Organization and used by other websites. She said Drinkaware\u2019s website would be amended to remove a single mistaken reference to daily instead of weekly drinking guidance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
