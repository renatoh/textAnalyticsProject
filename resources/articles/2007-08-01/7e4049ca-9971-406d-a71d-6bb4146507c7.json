The information should be easy to find, right? So why have you just spent the last hour trying to locate it? Like many things, it's all about the way you ask. Search engines only look for keywords, so typing in a sentence full of \"ands\" and \"ifs\" isn't going to help. Try using only the words that are most likely to appear, and put any phrases in quote marks so the search engine knows not to look for each word individually. Another way to cut down the pages of results is by using modifiers. For example, if you only want to find documents where the words appear in the title, just enter \"allintitle:\" before your search terms. Likewise, if you know that the URL of a website contains certain words type \"allinurl:\" instead. A handy one when looking for definitions is to put \"define:\" before your word, which will bring up a selection of definitions from a range of sources. On the flip side, if there's something you know you're not searching for, you can omit these results by using the minus sign. So, for instance, if you're looking into history and enter the word \"Queen\" you can avoid anything Bohemian Rhapsody-related by following your search term with \"-band\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
