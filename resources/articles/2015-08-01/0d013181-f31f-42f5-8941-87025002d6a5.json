An entertaining goalless draw with Liverpool left Arsenal scoreless in five of their past six Premier League games at the Emirates Stadium and their clean sheet was secured here by two instinctive saves \u2013the first breathtaking \u2013 by Petr Cech. Arsenal threatened greater reward after the interval and departed cursing an Aaron Ramsey first-half goal wrongly ruled out for offside, but Neville\u2019s pre-match observations in his capacity as a pundit for Sky still seemed pertinent. The England coach was discussing the apparent shift in Wenger\u2019s thought process from Arsenal\u2019s Invincibles in 2004 to the present day and scrutinising a list of the signings made in the five years after his team\u2019s last title triumph. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a word to describe that bunch,\u201d Neville said. \u201cI could but it wouldn\u2019t be usable on television. They\u2019re certainly not what I would call what you want to win you a league, the powerful characters, the strength you need running through your team. The profile of players completely changed and the style has changed and that to me is where I\u2019ve got no sympathy. \u201cI just cannot get my head around why he would not sign players of power to assist these talented players you\u2019ve got to enable them to win the league. It is the one big, if you like, black mark against Ars\u00e8ne Wenger in these last 10 years: why he hasn\u2019t identified an issue with these types of players [points to Francis Coquelin and Santi Cazorla] because they cannot win the league with those types of players. It can\u2019t happen. To me it\u2019s arrogance: to think that you are not going to adapt your team to impact on the other teams you\u2019re playing against. It is either naivety or arrogance because they keep losing this way.\u201d Those comments were put to Wenger. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what that has to do with arrogance,\u201d said the Arsenal manager. \u201cI try just to do my job well for 20 years. I leave judgment to everybody else, the assessment of the quality of my work. Everybody is entitled to that opinion. I could prove to you that it\u2019s not necessarily right but let\u2019s not go into that debate tonight. When you don\u2019t win, you\u2019re wrong and people find reasons. Are they good reasons? I have enough experience to know when it\u2019s right and when it\u2019s wrong. \u201cSharpness is missing a bit. We still miss the spontaneous attitude to finish well what we start. We have started very average, I must concede, with four points after two home games and maybe we won the most difficult game away from home [at Crystal Palace]. And, at this moment, we have not scored [at home].\u201d Wenger, who had been denied his first-choice centre-halves through injury and illness, described Ramsey\u2019s disallowed attempt as \u201ca regular goal\u201d and praised Cech\u2019s reactions for \u201csaving us two or three times in the first half\u201d. The Liverpool manager, Brendan Rodgers, offered similar praise of the goalkeeper\u2019s display but, without the injured Jordan Henderson and Adam Lallana in his own ranks, gleaned satisfaction at the point and a third successive clean sheet in the league. \u201cOur performance level is improving all the time,\u201d said Rodgers, who would not comment on Mario Balotelli\u2019s proposed loan move to Milan. \u201cThe focus is very much on the football element with my teams, but anyone who has followed my career will know the intensity of how we press and the cohesion as a team. That was something that drifted last season, for sure. So it was important that, defensively, we were super organised. That will be the platform for us going forward.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
