Trump\u2019s remarks on Saturday morning came in the wake of his eleventh-hour decision to call off airstrikes in reprisal for the downing of a US surveillance drone. They are significant in that they differ starkly from the official line of his own administration: that Iran must fulfil a list of 12 US demands before sanctions can be lifted. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to have a nuclear weapon,\u201d Trump told reporters before leaving the White House for Camp David. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have Iran have a nuclear weapon. \u201cWhen they agree to that, they\u2019re going to have a wealthy country. They\u2019re going to be so happy, and I\u2019m going to be their best friend. I hope that happens.\u201d Iran has insisted it has no intention of acquiring nuclear weapons and the International Atomic Energy Agency has said there is no recent evidence of development or experimentation with weaponisation. Iran has so far stuck to the limits on its nuclear programme agreed in a multilateral 2015 agreement. But more than a year after Trump pulled the US out of the deal and imposed severe sanctions, the government in Tehran is threatening to break some of those agreed limits. Iran has defended the shooting down of a US navy Global Hawk drone on Thursday morning, saying it had entered Iranian airspace. A senior commander of the elite Revolutionary Guards struck a defiant note on Saturday, in comments quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). Brig Gen Amirali Hajizadeh, head of the Guards\u2019 aerospace division, said: \u201cThis is our response to a violation of Iranian space and if the violation is repeated then our response will be repeated. It\u2019s possible that this infringement of the Americans was carried out by a general or some operators.\u201d Hajizadeh appeared to be mirroring Trump\u2019s suggestion that the shooting down of the drone was the work of a rogue Iranian general. Trump said he would be holding meetings to discuss the standoff with Iran. In his remarks, he seemed to confirm for the first time an Iranian claim that there was a manned US spy plane in the air near the Global Hawk when the drone was brought down. \u201cThere was a plane with 38 people yesterday, did you see that?\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a big story. They had it in their sights and they didn\u2019t shoot it down. I think they were very wise not to do that. And we appreciate that they didn\u2019t do that. I think that was a very wise decision.\u201d In an interview for NBC\u2019s Meet the Press taped on Friday but due to air on Sunday, Trump said if a conflict did break out there would be \u201cobliteration like you\u2019ve never seen before\u201d. \u201cBut I\u2019m not looking to do that,\u201d he said, making clear that potential that Iran might build nuclear weapons was his sole concern. Last May, secretary of state Mike Pompeo laid down 12 conditions for the normalisation of US-Iran relations, which included nuclear demands but also limits on missile development, withdrawal from Syria and an end to support for Houthi rebels in Yemen. Trump, who has been seeking to start a dialogue with Tehran, made no mention of non-nuclear conditions. The combination of dire threats and openness to freewheeling dialogue echoes Trump\u2019s approach to North Korea in 2017. \u201cTrump is notoriously mercurial but one thing he is consistent on is that he does not want to drag the US into a new war,\u201d said Thomas Juneau, a former Canadian diplomat and assistant professor at the University of Ottawa. \u201cHis face-saving solution is to say he called off a military strike on Iran. We have avoided direct violence, but the underlying issues are still there with no off-ramp or process at this point that could lead to a de-escalation.\u201d Trump said he was \u201cgetting praise\u201d for having called off the reprisal strike. \u201cEveryone was saying I\u2019m a warmonger,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they\u2019re saying I\u2019m a dove.\u201d He said his decision made clear he was not in thrall to the hawks he has appointed around him, including his national security adviser. \u201cI have John Bolton, who I would definitely say is a hawk,\u201d he said. \u201cI have other people that are on the other side of the equation. Ultimately I make the decision. The only one that matters is me. I listen to everybody. I want people on both sides.\u201d Trump also gave more detail on how the issue of estimated casualties from US strikes, predicted by 150 by the Pentagon, affected his decision. \u201cThey gave me a rough estimate earlier, but I wanted a more accurate estimate, the more accurate estimates were, I won\u2019t go into the number of sites, but ... it was on average 40 to 50 people to the site,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI come from New York City, we have a lot of Iranians. And they\u2019re great people. I have friends that are Iranians. They\u2019re very smart, they\u2019re very ambitious and tremendous high-quality people. I don\u2019t want to kill 150 Iranians. I don\u2019t want to kill 150 of anything or anybody, unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary.\u201d On Saturday, the Iranian foreign ministry summoned a United Arab Emirates envoy to complain about the UAE allowing the US drone to be launched from a US base on its territory, the Iranian Fars news agency reported. Foreign ministry spokesperson Abbas Mousavi told the semi-official Tasnim news agency: \u201cRegardless of any decision [US officials] make, we will not allow any of Iran\u2019s borders to be violated. Iran will firmly confront any aggression or threat by America.\u201d A diplomat in the region said: \u201cIran doesn\u2019t just feel attacked by the military threat. It\u2019s mostly by the sanctions. Even if the US doesn\u2019t attack, Iran will perceive the sanctions as an escalation and may feel they have to respond to those. I don\u2019t think the US understands this. \u201cTrump presents himself as open to negotiations, but he isn\u2019t really. He won\u2019t remove sanctions and rejoin the [nuclear deal] and anything he says isn\u2019t credible because he pulled out of that agreement in the first place.\u201d In London on Saturday, the British government said a Foreign Office minister would visit Iran on Sunday to call for \u201curgent de-escalation in the region\u201d. The ministry said: \u201cAt this time of increased regional tensions and at a crucial period for the future of the nuclear deal, this visit is an opportunity for further open, frank and constructive engagement with the government of Iran.\u201d To NBC, Trump denied a report that US planes were in the air when he aborted the attack on Thursday night Washington time. He said: \u201cNo, but they would have been pretty soon, and things would have happened to a point where you would not turn back, you could not turn back. Nothing was green lighted until the very end because things change.\u201d There has been some scepticism about Trump\u2019s account. The Washington Post quoted US officials as saying the president had been given casualty estimates earlier in the day and had still approved the operation, which would likely have used Tomahawk sea-launched cruise missiles aimed at anti-aircraft batteries and other military targets. Trump has tweeted there were three targets in all. According to the New York Times, the casualty estimate was supplied by Pentagon lawyers and passed to the president by White House counsel Pat Cipollone, bypassing hawkish national security aides. Tucker Carlson, the rightwing talk show host, reportedly told Trump a conflict with Iran would torpedo his chances of re-election. The Times also quoted Gen Jack Keane, a retired army vice-chairman close to the Trump White House, as saying the president received information that Iranian leaders were furious with the local commander who had ordered the Global Hawk to be shot down."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
