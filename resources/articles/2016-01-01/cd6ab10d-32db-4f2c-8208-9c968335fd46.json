It was far from the first time they \u201chad failed to see games out\u201d. The situation did not arise again on Saturday at home to Wigan, who scored after 16 minutes, but now Crewe cut to the chase, caught up before half-time and held out for a worthy 1-1 draw. Wigan lie comfortably fourth in League One, Crewe last but not in the least worried. This is familiar territory for them. The Railwaymen know their station \u2013 it is five minutes\u2019 walk away \u2013 and remain happy to shunt between fourth and second tiers as they have through history, sticking to their line and ignoring the signals from other clubs of knee-jerk dismissal. Eleven of the 36 managerial changes this season have been in League One, including all three clubs immediately above them. Oldham have been responsible for two. Unveiling John Sheridan last week their chairman, Simon Corney, said: \u201cJohn has always been high on my list whenever we have appointed managers\u201d \u2013 except, perhaps, when they had sacked him in 2009 with the club eighth in the same division. Crewe do things differently, unmoved by fashion, proud of principle and presenting an almost old-fashioned matchday experience of stability and smiling hospitality. Last season they survived on the last day through no credit of their own; they lost at home to Bradford. They have won only twice at Gresty Road since and even lost there to Eastleigh in the FA Cup. But most of their fans, fewer than 4,000 on Saturday and out-shouted by more than 2,000 from Wigan, seem to accept there are more important things in both life and football, such as youth development with an emphasis on technical skills as espoused for more than a quarter of a century by Dario Gradi, who is still director of football at 74. Davis, now 50, made his mark early at Crewe, promoted to captain at 19 after starting his playing career as Gradi began as manager. He played more than 100 games there, then at Burnley and Barnsley, and gained non-league managerial experience before returning after Gradi\u2019s fourth spell in November 2011 and taking them up from League Two six months later in the play-offs. Though remembered on Saturday as \u201can industrial defender\u201d, he carries Gradi\u2019s torch faithfully. The result was a game of fine enterprise and tactical wit. Wigan, after four managers and two relegations in three years, are looking up under Gary Caldwell, 33 and of the same ID, who failed to stop the club\u2019s second drop in his five games last season, after ceding his playing career to injury. After a big summer turnover they are brimming with confidence. Yanic Wildschut, a speedy Dutchman wide on the left, was fed relentlessly and Crewe\u2019s Oliver Turton could have done with more help from George Cooper in front. \u201cWe tried to force them into wide areas,\u201d Davis said afterwards, \u201cbut we needed to retain the opportunity to break.\u201d If the flow of crosses put a blocking burden on the centre-backs, Ben Nugent and Semi Ajayi \u2013 no half-measures here \u2013 the willingness to break and match the high tempo of Wigan\u2019s game was clear. Their goal came from it. Reece Wabara had put Wigan ahead with a snapshot after sustained pressure but the equaliser rewarded Crewe\u2019s intent to play on the front foot with three up against Wigan\u2019s back three. Ben Garratt put Ryan Colclough away on the right from a Wigan corner and Bradden Inman took a precise pass on his chest and beat Jussi Jaaskelainen at the near post. Colclough, with deceptive footwork and acceleration in his first season at 21, still had time to measure a chip against the bar before half-time, leading no doubt to Dave Perkins\u2019 horrible foul straight after it. Colclough was not cowed and Garratt, solid in goal against distant shots, deserved the luck attached to Wildschut\u2019s that hit a post. Davis was pleased they \u201ckept shape and discipline\u201d and said: \u201cEvery time we score it\u2019s a good move but we need to get scrappy ones, too. Most managers scratch their heads over where we are.\u201d They have 20 games to go, starting at Bury tomorrow. He may not get 20 years but, if Crewe go down, it will surely be playing up to their beliefs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
