We had a good wage deal and I now get \u00a38.10 an hour, which is reasonable. In this last year quite a number of drivers have gone off to jobs on the trains because it's better money but I wasn't interested in starting again at my age. And the West Yorkshire council pension is worth hanging on to. There's always a bus-driver shortage. People can't hack it. The roads are so busy and every week someone is assaulted, either a driver or a passenger. Most of the buses have got CCTV now which is good. The city is booming and there's a new cinema and club complex in the centre so we have traffic jams at 2am. I work nights. At the weekends you can't move for the taxis and unlicensed minicabs, so even the night buses have been overloaded and run late. We're all waiting for the supertram which would run along four main routes from the outskirts into the centre. The scheme is out to tender and is supposed to be running by 2007. [Private contractors are bidding to build and run the \u00a3500m government funded project.] If it does get off the ground it'll be a good thing. The traffic is really bad. Public voices: March 21 2001 Bus driver, Leeds Salary: \u00a38.12 an hour from April 1 We've got more passengers on the bus since last year. There's a new bus lane, four miles of it, opened on the main road in Leeds and that's made a hell of a difference. It makes everything \"go\" for the bus, the traffic lights, a clear run. I can see the difference myself as a driver. Our money goes up to \u00a38.12 an hour from April (it was \u00a37.20 last year). I usually drive nights, and work a four-day week, 38 hours, but there's an optional fifth day and overtime so I come out with \u00a3276 after tax, sometimes even \u00a3340 if I do seven days. The train strikes have a terrible effect on us. Everything gets clogged up, but it affects the driver numbers as well. Last year there were a lot of lads leaving because there was a big recruitment for train drivers at Leeds station. You could see them all queuing up round the corner. Wouldn't you with the wages they're getting? The company, First Leeds, are really working hard to overcome low incomes. They have to. We have so many new drivers coming and going and it costs money to train them. A lot of last year's new recruits are moving off starter pay on to better wages now here, so there's less resentment. The violence is getting worse though. A lot of drivers have been assaulted. It's not like it used to be, they're using knives and guns now. We carry a hell of a lot of money, especially at night. You can't afford to think about it too much or you wouldn't go out to work. Some people are off with stress. The company's doing a lot about it - they've got video cameras on the new buses with links back to the garage, so that helps. I've had a few scuffles with passengers, abuse, you know, \"I'll kick your head in\" threats, but not actual weapons myself. The passengers are just the same. The traffic's worse and it all comes down to whether you are on time. They aren't very happy when you pick them up. The Common Good: March 21 2001 Bus driver, Leeds Salary: \u00a37.20 an hour I enjoy it really. I've been driving for 23 years. I think I work well with the public and I've never had a lot of confrontation, and that goes a long way in the job. I feel I've achieved that myself. I'm on permanent nights. We've got a system where you do 10-hour days. They're long days, I'll be honest with you, and the traffic congestion gets to you. I've been doing nights for 15 years or so and it's easier. If I were working five to six days a week in traffic I'd get a bit agitated, whereas I've only got an hour of it on nights. Before privatisation they used to have money to spend, but now it's business and these people have got to make profits. That's the bad side of it. There are no spare staff, if people get sick or what. We do 38 hours in a four day week, plus the optional fifth day if you want it. The daytime lads moan that they're tired, the duty patterns mess up your system, but I'm lucky. I feel better off, though I do get all the drunks till 4 in the morning. I'm on the A rate, the top rate, because I've been here a long time, \u00a37.20 an hour. Anyway I usually take home \u00a3235 a week after tax. I don't get much time to get out and spend it. My qualifications are in tailoring, as a cutter, but that all went downhill in the 1960s, that's why I gave the buses a try, so I couldn't do that again. If I went to work for a haulage company I don't think I could get any more money. Never thought about it really. Plus the conditions are good, the pensions and what have you. Do I feel valued by the public? No, I do not. I like to feel when I'm going out there that I'm doing my bit for the public, but then someone upsets you. It's the traffic, you get late, someone has to stop for a break because of the shift rule, and you try to explain, but they just don't want to know."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
