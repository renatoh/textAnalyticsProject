Look at footage of them interacting with anyone from infants to world leaders and you'll see the human eyes lock on to those ping-pong ball peepers the Muppets have, and the little bundle of cloth and plastic is treated like a proper person. Mostly this is down to the operator, the Muppeteer. They do their job so well they become invisible. Constance Marks's excellent, touching documentary focuses on one such puppeteer, Kevin Clash, who controls the phenomenally popular Elmo. Clash's story is one of unwavering belief, from an early age, that he'd end up doing what he loved as a job. It's a story that he must share with many others in his field; puppeteering isn't something one wanders into late in life. Clash's basic but stable upbringing in Baltimore was far enough away from Jim Henson's New York studios to make his dream seem unachievable as he performed his little puppet shows first for neighbourhood kids, then hospitals and local TV. Never without support from his family, a key ingredient, Clash not only made it to his dream job but also had a hand in (and up) one of their key characters when Elmo landed in his lap \u2013 literally, when a fellow puppeteer threw the at the time unloved Elmo at Clash and asked if he thought he could do anything with it. It's a story full of the interesting tips that make the Muppets so real to people, but it's also a tale of holding on to dreams and of nurturing, rather than mocking, those dreamers. DVD, Dogwoof The Discreet Charm Of The Bourgeoise At a recent BFI interview, screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re stated that the imagination was a muscle, something to be exercised, and that at this Luis Bu\u00f1uel was Olympic standard, an athlete of the imagination. This is one of the duo's best collaborations and it's one where you can almost see the workings: a situation and characters would be set, then they'd come up with something to alter the scene's natural course. Such as when a group of well-dressed men meet in an office, one spies a beautiful woman through the window, so another goes to a cupboard to fetch his rifle \u2026 The film is full of scenes like this, most set around the characters gathering for a dinner that never arrives. Bu\u00f1uel and Carri\u00e8re used this as a springboard for a series of mental games, each trying to outdo the other; to deliver a film full of incident but without plot, to see how long they could keep these plates spinning. It's one of the classics of surrealist cinema, one of Bu\u00f1uel's most accessible and funniest films, the playfulness of the writing process arriving fully intact on the screen. Blu-ray &amp; DVD, Studio Canal Born To Kill Robert Wise's wonderfully amoral, sharp-edged 1947 film noir, complete with a great performance by Lawrence Tierney as the no-nonsense, bullish villain. Blu-ray &amp; DVD, Odeon Total Recall Undoubtedly Arnold Schwarzenegger's smartest film, thanks to Verhoeven's ambiguous and ultra-violent direction, altogether a great-looking remastering ahead of the remake. Blu-ray &amp; DVD, Studio Canal Damages: Season 4 John Goodman and Dylan Baker join Glenn Close for another series of her tightly plotted, well acted and distinctly dark legal series. Blu-ray &amp; DVD, Sony Act Of Valour Saddled with a corny and overtly patriotic script, the Navy Seal cast deliver some poor acting but at least there's plenty of strong and authentic action throughout. Blu-ray &amp; DVD, Momentum"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
