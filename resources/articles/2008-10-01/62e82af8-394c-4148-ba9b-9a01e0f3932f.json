On Wednesday night, for instance, Balanchine's Apollo acquired a most unfamiliar flavour of imperial grandeur. This was partly due to Valery Gergiev, who had flown in to conduct and whose slowish, solidly delineated sound had the effect of conjuring St Petersburg palaces rather than airy Parnassus. But Zelensky, in the title role, also seemed like a boy czar, radiating an air of entitlement and remoteness. This was hard on his three Muses, for while they danced perfectly well on their own - particularly Olesya Novikova - it looked as though they hadn't been granted sufficient rehearsal time with Zelenksy. When he partnered them, the dancing looked hesitant, the images blurred. Much more successfully Russian was the Mariinsky's take on Prodigal Son. Some western companies struggle with the period expressionism of this work: the Siren's bizarre insect manoeuvres, the grotesqueries of her scuttling henchmen. Yet this was the idiom of experimental theatre that Balanchine had known in 1920s Petrograd, and it has left its trace in the Mariinsky bloodline. This was a fine performance, and Kondaurova in particular owned the predatory moves of the Siren like no other ballerina. Ratmansky's Middle Duet is another very Russian piece, featuring a couple whose agitated dance conversation is overseen by a black and white angel. But this early work is not one of Ratmansky's best, and the honours of the programme go to Novikova and Vladimir Shklyarov in Balanchine's Tchaikovsky pas de deux. This showy little duet has become a gala standard, but these two dance with a natural, blithe recklessness that makes the choreography look freshly minted. They are names to watch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
