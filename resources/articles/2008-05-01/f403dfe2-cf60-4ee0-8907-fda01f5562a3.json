Suzanne Holdsworth, 37, a mother of two, was jailed for life in March 2005 after being found guilty of murdering two-year-old Kyle Fisher. It was found she had repeatedly banged his head against a wooden banister. Three judges at the court of appeal in London yesterday ordered a retrial in light of medical evidence that suggested that the child could have had an epileptic seizure. They also took the unusual step of releasing her on conditional bail pending a retrial. Holdsworth was said to be \"highly emotional\" as she was reunited with her family after leaving Low Newton prison in County Durham, where she had served three years of a life sentence. During her trial at Teesside crown court, the prosecution claimed that Holdsworth had \"snapped\" while minding Kyle at her home in Hartlepool. The prosecution case rested on the claim that the boy died from a fatal brain swelling caused by a blow or blows of significant force. Jurors heard that the impact on his head was similar to being thrown from a car at 60mph. Holdsworth denied injuring the child and claimed he had suffered a fit as they sat watching television. During her appeal, Holdsworth's QC, Henry Blaxland, told the three judges that doctors at the original trial had \"got it wrong\", and fresh evidence established that there was a reasonable possibility that the child suffered a prolonged epileptic seizure. Medical experts supported the claim, pointing to three brain abnormalities that suggested the toddler was predisposed to epilepsy. The case has raised questions over the police murder inquiry that led to Holdsworth's prosecution and the use of medical evidence in criminal cases where an infant has died after head injuries. One Cleveland detective said last night that she was \"driven out\" of the force after raising questions about the case. In a statement issued through Cleveland Police, Kyle's family members said: \"All we have ever wanted was to know the truth about what happened to Kyle. Today's decision has brought all the heartache back. However we will fully cooperate in the preparation for the retrial.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
