The WA supreme court on Wednesday evening denied Sea Shepherd\u2019s bid for a judicial review of the shark-cull policy on grounds it had been rolled out following an incorrect legal process. The activists were also seeking an injunction to have the baited drum lines immediately removed pending the review. Speaking outside court, Sea Shepherd managing director Jeff Hansen said the activists felt obligated to \u201chave a crack\u201d at the case, and were determine to continue fighting the cull. \u201cWe will not cease in our efforts until these cruel, barbaric, unsafe and environmentally unsustainable drum lines are removed permanently,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat next can be targeted? Whether it\u2019s whales or dolphins, can they simply have exemptions to kill these animals as well? These are protected animals off our coast that play a vital role in the health of our oceans.\u201d WA premier Colin Barnett welcomed the decision, saying Sea Shepherd\u2019s case rested on legal technicalities, and that the policy was introduced following a rigorous process in expectation of legal challenges. WA Greens MLC Lynn Maclaren said the decision was upsetting for the majority of Australians, whom polls suggest are opposed to the cull. \u201cThis is also concerning for those that feel unsafe swimming in WA waters with a \u2018meat curtain\u2019 hanging just 1km off our popular beaches\u201d. In January, the WA government established shark \u201ckill zones\u201d off eight popular beaches in Perth and the state\u2019s south west, following seven fatal shark attacks in three years. Bull, tiger and great white sharks longer than 3m that are caught on baited hooks inside the zones can be killed. Earlier on Wednesday, the federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, announced that the shark cull policy would have to undergo a full environmental assessment in order to continue after its initial trial period ends on 30 April. Hunt said the issue \u201chas highlighted the need for further research into the shark population off the Australian coast\u201d. He announced funding for a project that would \u201caim to locate juvenile and nursery aggregation areas to enable genetic and electronic tagging to build a greater profile of the population and trends,\u201d he said. The WA government\u2019s lawyers will seek costs for the cause, slugging Sea Shepherd with a bill of up to $19,000. But Hansen says it was worth it. \u201cWe had to have a shot at this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will continue no matter what because we have right on our side.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
