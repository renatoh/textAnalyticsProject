MMP \u2013 mixed-member proportional \u2013 was designed to allow more diverse voices entry to parliament, and award more power to smaller parties in an attempt to dilute the hold that the Labour and National parties had on government. In this regard, it has worked. The 2017 coalition agreement between Labour, the Greens and New Zealand First saw more women and M\u0101ori MPs elected than ever before. But coalition agreements have seldom been easy, and many prime ministers have been forced to compromise on key election promises when they\u2019ve failed to gain the support of their coalition partners. Negotiations following elections can also be protracted, at one point lasting two months \u2013 between the National party and New Zealand First in 1996. In 2017, it took more than three weeks for Labour and New Zealand First to reach agreement. No governing can take place until coalition agreements are signed, meaning an often extended period of limbo following general elections. Recent polls have also shown that 79% of New Zealand voters believe that parties should announce their coalition intentions before the election, thus making it clear to voters who they are really voting for come polling day. Uneasy bedfellows In 2017 Jacinda Ardern had promised voters a capital gains tax but was forced to abandon the plan after failing to gain consensus from her coalition partners, NZ First and the Greens. Sir Michael Cullen, who chaired a tax working group for the government, said he wasn\u2019t \u201cin the least surprised\u201d the tax was dumped. \u201cI always thought there was a high probability that NZ First would veto any legislation,\u201d Cullen said at the time. Ardern was roundly criticised for failing to implement the tax, and has now promised to never introduce it while she is leader. While coalition governments have now become the norm, Labour is now polling 15 points ahead of National in the polls, and are in with a fighting chance of governing alone. Although this would no doubt make her job easier, Ardern has defended the MMP system and the minor parties, saying having them re-enter parliament is a personal goal. Under MMP smaller parties are often richly rewarded for having lent their support to leaders, allowing them to form a government. In 2017 NZ First leader Winston Peters sided with Labour, saying he wanted to \u201cshake up the status quo\u201d. His loyalty saw him win the title of deputy prime minister, as well as the foreign affairs portfolio. But multiple Labour ministers have expressed frustration with NZ First blocking some of their flagship policies. Recently, transport minister Phil Twyford spoke candidly on the often tense relationship. \u201cThey\u2019ve got different priorities, and different political principles than us,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re talking about industrial relations reform, or the capital gains tax or light rail \u2013 New Zealand First they\u2019ve got their views about those. I always hoped we\u2019d get them over the line but it wasn\u2019t to be.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
