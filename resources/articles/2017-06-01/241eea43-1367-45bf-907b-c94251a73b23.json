Now wash the trunks away", "bodyText": "I don\u2019t know much about art, but I like Antony Gormley\u2019s \u201cIron Men\u201d statues (official name: Another Place) on the sands at Crosby, Merseyside. There\u2019s a sombre dignity, a sense of permanence, about them, and it\u2019s great that the public is able to interact with them. Except perhaps when the public interacts too much. Someone has been \u201cvandalising\u201d them \u2013 by which I mean they\u2019ve painted a polka-dot bikini on one (a tad jarring when teamed with the pronounced male anatomical details? I\u2019ll let you decide) and shorts, shirts and the words \u201cI am art\u201d on others. This isn\u2019t the first time that the Iron Men have been \u201cembellished\u201d\u2013 by whom remains an enduring mystery, though previously Everton and Liverpool football shirts were involved. Gormley has now politely requested that the statues be cleaned and left alone, which is fair enough. Doodling beach-grundies on to his artwork is no way to thank Gormley for allowing the statues to stay on at Crosby when they were originally intended to move to New York. Let this be the end of the matter, though it must be said that, in the hot and difficult week just passed, at least one philistine was grateful for the chuckle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
