The Championship side took the lead with a 44th-minute Bobby Reid penalty, before Kevin De Bruyne equalised 10 minutes into the second half. Despite Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s added\u2011time winner, Bristol City remain alive in the tie and their manager is intent they will again be a difficult proposition in a fortnight\u2019s time. \u201cI think it will be interesting,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cCity have big games coming up and the atmosphere at Ashton Gate will be phenomenal. You heard how loud they [the travelling fans] were tonight. They enjoyed themselves and the players did them proud.\u201d Johnson pointed to Bristol City\u2019s away goal, which will come into play should they defeat Manchester City 1-0 at the end of extra time in the return. \u201cIt\u2019s half-time and we\u2019ve got the away goal, we are still in the tie,\u201d he said. \u201cThe buzz continues, the buildup will be exciting. Pep Guardiola said to me we played better than most of the Premier League teams that come to Manchester City. We will take an awful lot from it and learn a lot. It is not over.\u201d Guardiola was content with his team\u2019s display, saying of his players: \u201cThey give everything. The performance was good. Every time we try to make the best performance possible but the performance was good, really good. Manchester City fans around the world must be so proud. It will be tough in Bristol.\u201d He refused to answer a question about Manchester City\u2019s \u00a320m bid for Arsenal\u2019s Alexis S\u00e1nchez."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
