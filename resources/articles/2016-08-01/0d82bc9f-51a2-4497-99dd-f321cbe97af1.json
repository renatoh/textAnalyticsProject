Joyce, the super-heavyweight, progressed to the semi-finals; Buatsi, the young light-heavyweight who has been the find of the tournament, fell short at that stage against the 27-year-old Kazak Adilbek Niyazymbetov, although he can leave Rio proud of a bronze medal at his first \u2013 and possibly last \u2013 Olympics. At 23 he will almost certainly not wait four years to turn professional. His heavy fists can earn him serious money but they could not bring him the win over three three-minute rounds he needed here to reach the final. Niyazymbetov, who has been around, fiddled and sniped his way to a unanimous points decision and there could be no argument with three scores of 29-28 in his favour. This was the most anticipated bout of the evening, given the unseeded Buatsi\u2019s sensational arrival at the highest level with a pair of early knockouts against the third and sixth seeds. Now he faced the second favourite in his division, a seasoned, 5ft 11in Kazak who was prepared to tear his head off for a chance to fight Julio C\u00e9sar La Cruz. The excellent Cuban outboxed the fifth-seeded Frenchman, Mathieu Bauderlique, and made him look more like Baudelaire than an Olympic boxer. There was poetry of sorts in Buatsi\u2019s bout, a serial exchange of couplets between two fighters who did not much care for each other at the start but were gentlemen at the end. When the referee intervened to tidy up an early locking of horns the Kazak glared at his opponent, urging him on for a war if he wanted one. He is a cagey operator, the southpaw, and he picked off the fast-improving and willing Buatsi with neat counters as he moved into range looking to unload. He had success too with a sweeping right hook around Buatsi\u2019s guard and won the nod from all three judges in round one. The haunting statistic that nearly 70% of boxers who win the first round win the fight might have been no concern to banger Buatsi, but he needed to land a heavy shot to impose himself on Niyazymbetov. The Great Britain coach, Robert McCracken, and his team have schooled the youngster well and he advanced behind a tighter guard in round two. Yet he struggled still. It is likely that over a longer distance he would find the task of hunting down his foe a more relaxed exercise, and again the Kazak took the points. Buatsi needed another knockout. A crunching right through the middle rocked back his opponent\u2019s tiring head, but he moved out of reach, pecking away on the back foot. A big left shook him on the ropes and Buatsi railed at the referee for interrupting the action with only a minute left. They grappled and scrapped in an ugly heap as Buatsi desperately looked for the space and distance to do his work. Then it was done: nine frustrating minutes to bring his Brazilian adventure to a conclusion. Buatsi knew he had run out of time, but there will be other nights. He has a lot of potential, yet it is obvious he is better suited to the professional ranks, where time will be on his side. What the super-heavyweight quarter-final lacked in finesse it more than made up for in unadulterated power as Joyce, the late-blooming 30-year-old part-time model and former rugby player, embroidered the head of his 23-year-old Uzbek dancing partner, Bakhodir Jalolov, with a string of heavy head shots. The 6ft 6in, PE student from Tashkent, whose hero is Novak Djokovic, returned everything in the first round to edge it but faded in the second, and went to the floor as much from exhaustion as the weight of his opponent\u2019s blows. Emboldened by the sight of his wilting foe Joyce pounded away and levelled the contest at a round apiece. Would that first-round bogey still his advance? No. The Uzbek took a standing eight count early in the third and looked there for the taking. He fired back briefly but was in full retreat after being warned for holding. Every Joyce shot was getting its dividend in the closing stages. A stiff left hook rattled his jaw and Jalolov took another standing eight. That was enough and Joyce was through to the semi-finals, where he will meet the second seed, Ivan Dychko of Kazakhstan, who outpointed the dangerous Nigerian Efe Ajagba in the second quarter-final. It was another bout of honest bravery. And, to be honest, honesty was in short supply on Tuesday. It had been a night so at odds with the daily session \u2013 when the Irishman Michael Conlan stormed away in defeat shouting about corruption \u2013 that it was hard to imagine it was the same sport."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
