The original reason for drawing up the code, which is being put together by the RFU's performance director Chris Spice, was public criticism of the England team voiced by the Newcastle director of rugby Rob Andrew last November, an outburst which infuriated the national manager Clive Woodward. But the need for one has been given an added urgency in the past week after the most public of spats between Newcastle and Gloucester and between Northampton and London Irish. The chief executive of Premier Rugby, Howard Thomas, said that there was a compelling argument for a code of conduct which went beyond who could say what about Woodward and England. \"A lot of the mud which has been flung should have been kept in hand,\" he said. \"Until the last week it had been a very good season for English rugby in terms of publicity, and we know only too well after the politics of past years how unprofitable letting our bath water out in public is. \"The code must not amount to a gagging order, but we clearly need one. It is one thing to draw up a code but another to decide on sanctions for those who fall foul of it, and there has to be an element of carrot and stick. \"We have to be conscious of the enormous stress that directors of rugby operate under these days. Jobs are on the line and things are said in the heat of the moment at press conferences which are held not long after the end of a game when the adrenalin is still running. We need to help those involved at the sharp end in areas like media training.\" The Gloucester hooker Olivier Azam and the Newcastle flanker Epi Taione were sent off during the league match at Kingsholm at the end of last month. In Andrew's post-match press conference he accused Azam of calling Taione a \"black bastard\" and claimed some Gloucester supporters had been ejected from the ground for shouting racial insults. Gloucester vehemently protested their innocence on both counts and produced a 65-page document in evidence. The club's owner Tom Walkinshaw then announced that Andrew had been banned from Kingsholm and Newcastle responded by submitting to the RFU a formal complaint, which will be considered tomorrow at the disciplinary hearing of Azam and Taione. Newcastle did not submit any evidence with their complaint but are expected to do so tomorrow, pleading that Taione punched Azam after being insulted. Northampton and London Irish traded insults after a confrontational match at Franklin's Gardens on the same day. Fiji's Marika Vunibaka, who was cited for punching an opponent during a World Sevens Series semi-final last Saturday, has been banned from all rugby for 12 weeks. The right-wing's ban starts with immediate effect and will end on March 31."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
