As the billionaire financier and cricket entrepreneur was tracked down by the FBI in Virginia yesterday, an investigation broadened around the world into his allegedly corrupt Stanford International group. The Venezuelan government seized a Stanford-linked bank after a run on deposits, and in Britain the Serious Fraud Office said it was monitoring a link to an auditing firm with offices in London. Customers lined up outside branches of Stanford-controlled banks on the Caribbean island of Antigua to withdraw their savings. Lawyers representing investors who put money into Stanford International accused the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of failing to act on a succession of \"red flags\" arousing anxiety as far back as 1995. In London, international fraud expert Jeffrey Robinson said suspicions over Stanford dated back 15 years and were on \"everybody's radar\" for the past decade. \"I know personally, because I have discussed it with them, a number of law enforcement agencies in the United States, plus a number of prosecutors who have been looking at Mr Stanford for the past 15 years,\" Robinson, a journalist and author, told the BBC's Today programme. US law enforcement authorities have accused Stanford of selling $8bn of purportedly ultra-safe certificates of deposit to American investors by advertising allegedly bogus returns as high as 10% annually and making false promises about the way the money was invested. America's ABC News network, citing US federal authorities, claimed the FBI was also investigating whether Stanford was involved in laundering money for a Mexican drugs cartel. Quoting unnamed officials, it alleged that Mexican authorities had found cheques from a drugs gang in a detained private jet owned by Stanford. The FBI would not comment on the report, but the US's Drug Enforcement Administration, which investigates claims relating to drug smuggling, said there were no active investigations regarding Stanford. \"It's very frustrating for investors that the SEC and other regulators have been investigating for years and haven't done anything,\" said Ross Intelisano, a New York securities lawyer. \"It's frustrating they took so long to shut him down.\" An SEC complaint against Stanford mentions that as long ago as 1995 and 1996 Stanford International reported identical annual returns of 15.71% \u2013 a statistical phenomenon so unlikely that the agency views it as \"impossible\". In 2006, a former Stanford employee, Laurence De Maria, filed a lawsuit in Florida claiming that the bank was operating a \"Ponzi scheme\" by taking investors' money under false pretences to finance an unprofitable offshore brokerage. Stanford paid a $20,000 (\u00a314,000) fine in 2007 for having insufficient capital to act as a broker dealer, followed by $10,000 the same year for misleading investors about its certificates of deposit. Last year, it was fined $30,000 by the US financial industry regulatory authority for failing to disclose how it was valuing securities. Regulators complain that Stanford consistently refused to co-operate with questions over the whereabouts of clients' money. Thomas Ajamie, a Texas lawyer representing Stanford clients, said: \"If the regulators are not being let in, that's not a red flag \u2013 it's a bright red explosion in front of you.\" Business groups in Houston are keen to play down the local importance of Stanford. \"Stanford has approximately 500 employees in Houston,\" said Christina Garza, a spokeswoman for the Greater Houston Partnership. \"That's three tenths of one percent of all employees in the financial services/banking sector in Houston and less than two hundredths of one percent of all employees in the region.\" Since federal marshals entered Stanford International's Texan offices on Tuesday, repercussions spread around the world. In the UK, the Serious Fraud Office said it was \"monitoring\" reports that Stanford's Antiguan auditor, CAS Hewlett, had recently moved its operations to London. Panamanian regulators occupied branches of a Stanford bank hit by a run on deposits, while Colombia and Ecuador halted the operations of local brokerages. In Caracas, President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's regime seized control of Stanford Bank Venezuela after customers withdrew $26.5m, amounting to 12% of deposits. The finance minister, Ali Rodriguez Araque, said: \"We have taken the decision to take over.\" A former president of Switzerland, Adolf Ogi, has stepped down from Stanford Financial Group's advisory board. Sportsmen including the golfer Vijay Singh faced dilemmas over whether to continue wearing Stanford-sponsored clothing. A Dallas judge has frozen Stanford's assets and business activities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
