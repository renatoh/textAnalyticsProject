While discussions about the viability of a merger were pushed into the spotlight by tweets from Roger Federer in April \u2013 since when both ATP and WTA chief executives, Andrea Gaudenzi and Steve Simon \u2013 have expressed support for it, Konta has underlined that it remains only an idea. \u201cBillie Jean King beat him [Federer] to that a long time ago,\u201d Konta said. \u201cSo I think it is something that has been talked about for a long time but having Roger vocalise it drew attention to it. I definitely think in the long run it makes sense for it to be one tour, it makes logical sense but I also know there are a lot of moving parts to it, and I know there will be a lot of people who won\u2019t want it to happen, but also a lot of people who do want it to happen.\u201d A prominent member of the WTA player council \u2013 which has convened frequently since the tour suspension \u2013 Konta points out that \u201cnot so much\u201d has been said since the initial discussion following Federer\u2019s tweets. Should anything come to fruition, she stresses the need for equality. \u201cFor me, for my comprehension, I don\u2019t understand how it wouldn\u2019t be of equals because if we are then talking about that, would it be us literally saying we are worth less than our male counterparts? It would have to be a merger of equals because that\u2019s what we are. I wouldn\u2019t see how, right now in today\u2019s age, it would be allowed to be called anything else.\u201d It is not difficult to understand Konta\u2019s caution. This time last year, her run to the semi\u2011finals at Roland Garros ended against Marketa Vondrousova after they were forced on to a half\u2011empty stadium away from the show courts following bad weather. She said afterwards that she was tired of women having to \u201cjustify their scheduling or their involvement in an event or their salary or their opportunities\u201d. She understands the potential cost of the WTA losing its independence. As eloquent as Konta has always been on general issues, she can be less forthcoming about her own tennis. She often projects her mentality, cocooning herself in relentless positivity. It can be difficult to know how she really feels. One year later, it is refreshing to hear an honest reflection of her Parisian fortnight. \u201cTo make it to the semis for the first time since 2017 was something special. But then there was bit of heartbreak for me \u2026 it was a tough match to lose because I had opportunities, and my opponent played well. Definitely whoever was going to lose that match was going to hurt, and it definitely hurt. But I can look back and say I am a semi-finalist at the French Open and it\u2019s something I can be proud of. And who knows, I may get another opportunity.\u201d As for now, Konta\u2019s ongoing knee injury is \u201cgetting there\u201d but is something she will always have to manage. She is open to contesting the planned LTA national tournaments as the tour remains frozen, now suspended until at least 31 July with the US Open\u2019s status to be declared in mid-June. She has started the Johanna Konta Podcast to pass the time. She misses strolling to her favourite cafe in Battersea Park. \u201cI miss people being relaxed as well,\u201d the 29-year-old player said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re outside you can feel people being anxious. I think there are quite a lot of angry people about, although there are a lot of very kind people who are being more friendly than normal and want to interact. But there is a lot of anxiety about.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
