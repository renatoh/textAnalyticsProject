All the buyer has to do is find a way to collect from the Saudi royal family. After battling for more than 20 years to collect the court-ordered award, worth almost \u00a3135m, Diana Bilinelli has decided to sell it on the chance that others may be able to collect it. Ms Bilinelli and her late ex-husband, Sheikh Muhammad al-Fassi, split over his plans to take more wives. In 1983 a Los Angeles judge awarded her half his assets, including two Boeing 707 airliners, 36 cars, a yacht and homes in Spain, London and Miami. Sheikh Fassi died in Cairo of an infected hernia in 2002 at the age of 50 after claiming he had transferred all his holdings to relatives, including the Saudi monarch, King Fahd, and his brother Prince Turki. \"It's a dandy investment opportunity,\" her lawyer told the Los Angeles Times."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
