After much sparring and antler-locking, mainly in Mexican territory, England's first opportunity to score followed a set piece in the ninth minute. Lee Naylor's inswinging corner from the right deceived the Mexico keeper Armando Navarrette but also John Terry, who headed wide from close range when scoring looked the easier option. Navarrette enjoyed another let-off following Shola Ameobi's shot from distance. Diving to his left, the keeper palmed the ball into the path of Jermaine Defoe but the angle was too acute for the West Ham United striker to capitalise. Coventry City's goalkeeper Chris Kirkland, like Defoe making his debut at this level, had to wait until midway through the half before tasting any meaningful action. Even then Kirkland had good reason not to expect to be involved when Louis Gonzalez delivered an innocuous-looking cross from the left. Titus Bramble misjudged the flight, however, allowing Rafael Marquez to test Kirkland with a downward header. Having aroused the keeper, the same player had him diving to his left seconds later to cover a low long-range effort but the Mexican aggression proved shortlived as Defoe, set up by Malcolm Christie's diagonal pass, tested Navarrette. Christie, who spent the first period playing in an unfamilar right wing role, was deployed as a striker in the second. It was one of many changes that England's coach Howard Wilkinson made during the interval, including giving a debut to the Arsenal teenager Jermaine Pennant. And it was Pennant who began the move from which England broke the deadlock three minutes after the interval, sprinting past Edoardo Isella before finding Defoe at the far post with a deep cross. Navarrette managed to block the West Ham youngster's shot but the rebound fell fortuitously for Christie, who obliged from close range. England came close to increasing their lead after another cross from the right, this a set piece delivered by Sean Davies which resulted in Navarrette tipping Matthew Upson's header over the crossbar. Davies's impressive probings met with a greater reward in the 74th minute when his through-ball allowed Defoe to spring the visitors' offside trap and slide the ball past Navarrette to put England firmly in control. That control became complete eight minutes from time when Isella was sent off, apparently for dissent. The centre back had been fortunate to avoid censure in the first half for two over-robust challenges - one on Ameobi, the other on David Dunn. And he showed his lack of cool again after Trevor Benjamin committed a foul. The Leicester striker was booked, but Isella's reaction was vio lent and the referee Michael McCurry decided - much to Isella's disgust - to show a red card. England wasted little time in exploiting their numerical superiority, the Coventry City striker Jay Bothroyd completing the scoring with a spectacular overhead kick five minutes from time.
