Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP) leaders living in self-imposed exile have vowed to \u201crestore democracy\u201d by returning to the country on 9 November. In the run-up to Saturday Cambodian authorities have jailed CNRP supporters and promised to arrest Sam Rainsy, the party leader, if he enters the country. On Thursday, Reuters reported that Mu Sochua, the deputy leader of the banned CNRP had been detained by Malaysian immigration authorities. Earlier, Sochua told the Guardian she would be with Rainsy when he stepped onto Cambodian soil for the first time in four years. Both have arrest warrants out for them relating to charges supporters say are politically motivated. \u201cWe will not abort our plan \u2026 to restore democracy and establish peace,\u201d Sochua said. Sochua, who spoke from Jakarta, had already been denied entry into Thailand at Bangkok\u2019s Suvarnabhumi airport on 20 October. The Cambodian government has told neighbouring countries not to allow Rainsy to enter Cambodia, and warned 47 airlines not to allow him or other CNRP leaders to fly to the country on their planes. Sochua insisted she still planned to enter Cambodia from Thailand, and that CNRP leaders will be supported by Cambodian migrant workers living in Thailand when they do so. She said: \u201cThe question should be asked to Mr Hun Sen: is he willing to kill his people? Is he calling a war? Is he willing to face an international criminal court? Is Mr Hun Sen willing to use the tanks? It\u2019s not the people facing the army, it\u2019s the army facing the people.\u201d On Monday, Cambodia\u2019s defence ministry said troops were performing exercises with live rounds along the Thai border. At least 48 other CNRP activists have been arrested so far this year, accused of planning to overthrow the government. Rainsy has vowed to \u201cbring about a democratic change, meaning to put an end to the current regime, which is a brutal dictatorship.\u201d On Wednesday he tweeted: \u201cI will depart from Paris on Thursday November 7. I will arrive in Bangkok on Friday November 8 to be ready to enter #Cambodia on Saturday November 9,\u201d with a photo of his airplane ticket. Since Rainsy\u2019s August announcement about his return to Cambodia, CNRP supporters have been targeted by officials in the country with increasing ruthlessness. Last month a video showing Seng Sokhorn, a former CNRP commune chief, calling Rainsy \u201ctreasonous\u201d was released by the government, sparking accusations that it was a forced confession. Sochua said the tactic \u201creminds of the practise of the Khmer Rouge. We see the signs of the Khmer Rouge coming back, and this is very very worrisome.\u201d Phil Robertson, Human Rights Watch\u2019s deputy Asia director, told The Guardian: \u201cCambodia\u2019s slew of arrests of CNRP activists, and mass mobilisation of troops and officials at the border with Thailand, smacks of desperation.\u201d He said the activities comprised a \u201cpropaganda ploy aimed at domestic public opinion.\u201d Rainsy has predicted that joyous crowds will greet him on his Cambodia return, but even in CNRP circles there are doubts that he will make it across the border. Kem Monovithya, the party\u2019s deputy director general of public affairs, said Rainsy\u2019s announcement was a \u201cPR stunt\u201d. Kem Monovithya\u2019s father, CNRP co-founder Kem Sokha, is reportedly under house arrest in Phnom Penh. Sochua rejected the idea that the return was a PR stunt, but said that securing his release would be a top priority once Rainsy entered Cambodia. \u201cDemocracy is at stake,\u201d said Sochua. \u201cOur people deserve to be free and to take real advantage of real democracy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
