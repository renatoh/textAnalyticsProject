In the meantime, America's independent moviemakers have (with a few exceptions, most especially John Sayles) retreated into a private world of idiosyncrasy and personal relationships unconnected to the public life and its moral demands. In March 2004, I identified writer-director Tom McCarthy's debut The Station Agent as embodying all the formulaic aspects of what I called the independent cinema's 'inaction movie': suicide, despair, alienation, eccentric outsiders coming to decaying regional backwaters. However, I still regarded it as 'a film of considerable quality... worth attending to'. Now, in his belated second film, The Visitor, McCarthy (who during these past four years has acted in such notable mainstream movies as Flags of Our Fathers, Syriana and Good Night and Good Luck) brings together the private and public worlds in the story of the middle-aged New England economics professor Walter Vale. He's played by the excellent 60-year-old character actor Richard Jenkins, whose expressively pitted face and balding head are familiar to moviegoers from several dozen appearances as cops, businessmen, political functionaries and other professional types, though few people could put a name to him before the TV series Six Feet Under. Now he is impressively centre stage, figuring in all but two sequences of the movie. Vale is a reticent, vaguely depressed man, no longer much interested in his teaching job at a university in Connecticut where he seems on good terms with neither pupils nor colleagues. The certificates on his office wall show he has degrees from the University of Illinois and Boston University (sound enough but not exactly Ivy League). The use of Tipp-ex to change the date on his syllabus suggests he's been teaching the identical course year after year. He wears tweed jackets and shirts with buttoned-down collars and drives a Volvo estate, a signifier in the movies that the owner is reasonably well off, cautious and calculatedly unflamboyant. We learn slowly and bit by bit, as we would of a withdrawn but not unfriendly neighbour, that he's a widower, his wife was a musician, his son lives abroad and the book he's supposed to be writing is unlikely ever to be finished. Compelled to represent his department at a developing countries conference in New York, Walter goes for the first time in a year or so to his Manhattan apartment. He's shocked to discover that it's occupied by a Syrian musician, Tarek Khalil (Haaz Sleiman) and his Senegalese girlfriend Zainab (Danai Gurira), a jewellery designer, both Muslims. They've rented it in good faith from a Russian conman, but after getting over the fact that Walter isn't an intruder, they're eager that he shouldn't report the matter to the police. It transpires that they're not only illegal occupants but illegal immigrants. Sympathising with their predicament, he invites them to remain as his guests until they find somewhere else to stay. Thus Walter, the detached authority on developmental economics and the problems of Third World countries, suddenly finds that his dry academic pursuits have become acutely personal. Tarek is open, friendly, trusting and introduces Walter to the djembe, the West African drum he expertly plays in a fusion jazz group. This provides a bond between them and puts him in touch with a liberating form of music, a valuable source of therapy for the repressed Walter. Zainab, on the other hand, is suspicious, reserved, taciturn and initially unresponsive to Walter's kindness. This is what saves her from Tarek's fate. One day, while accompanying Walter on the subway, Tarek is picked up by plainclothes officers of the NYPD and drawn into the Kafkaesque world of the immigration people. From the colourful bustle of Manhattan, he's transported to the blank, anomic area of Queens where he's incarcerated in a windowless correctional centre. Fear of being arrested themselves prevents Zainab and Tarek's mother (Hiam Abbass), who now lives in Michigan, from visiting him. So Walter remains his only link with the outside world. All else is set aside as he finds Tarek a lawyer and cares for his mother and Zainab. Ironically, the strain enables him to relax. There is, course, a limit to what Walter can do. Patience is recommended and except for two brief explosions of impotent anger, one on Tarek's part, the other on Walter's, there is no emotional grandstanding. And the film is essentially open-ended. Walter ends up despairing of a faceless bureaucracy that has derived further justification from the 'war on terror'. At the same time, his friendship for these three strangers has renewed his sense of social responsibility and broadened his feeling of humanity. There are wonderful moments in this oblique, understated picture: the shocked Zainab's first appearance, discovered in the bath at Walter's flat like Goldilocks in the three bears' home; Tarek taking Walter to jam with fellow drummers in Central Park; a trip on the Staten Island ferry when Tarek's mother, Zainab and Walter talk about the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island and the Twin Towers. But above all, The Visitor is a film that hangs together as a whole, the images carefully framed, scenes constantly echoing each other and it is memorably acted by all four principals. A great injustice would be done if Richard Jenkins were not to get an Oscar nomination for this performance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
