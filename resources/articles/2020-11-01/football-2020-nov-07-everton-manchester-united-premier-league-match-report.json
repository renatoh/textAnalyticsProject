His boys could not, and did not, fail him here. There was undoubted pressure on the United manager following defeats against Arsenal and Basaksehir but neither renewed scrutiny, an intensive workload nor the blow of falling behind derailed his team against Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s faltering side. Bruno Fernandes orchestrated victory \u2013 a club record-equalling seventh successive Premier League away win \u2013 with two goals and a stoppage time assist for Edinson Cavani, who came off the bench to score his first in United colours seconds after Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 had squandered a glaring chance to equalise for Everton. On such moments can managerial fortunes change. Solskj\u00e6r must have feared the worst when the Everton midfielder steadied himself to volley Alex Iwobi\u2019s cross into the United penalty area in the fourth minute of added time. He produced an air-shot instead, United broke and Fernandes unselfishly squared for the Uruguay international to beat Jordan Pickford with a convincing finish. It was a thoroughly deserved victory, albeit hard-earned and with a performance reflecting an arrival back from Turkey at 4am on Thursday. Everton had no such exertions and no such excuses for looking equally laboured. Their defence was prised open regularly and given scant protection by the new-look midfield that delivered the platform for their flying start to the campaign. Three consecutive defeats have rendered that a distant memory. Solskj\u00e6r turned to his bench with a look of resignation when his team\u2019s sharp start was punctured by Bernard\u2019s early opener, but their response to falling behind will have emboldened him. It was not the reaction of a side short on commitment or at odds with managerial instructions. United controlled the opening exchanges with crisp, one-touch passing and stretched their hosts repeatedly with intelligent movement. That was how they overturned the early deficit. Bernard was making his first Premier League start of the campaign and produced a lively display \u2013 he wasthe only midfielder in royal blue to impress \u2013 and a fine opening goal. For United, it was another example of the weak defending that regularly undermines their other bright work. Pickford, recalled after being dropped against Newcastle last week, launched a clearance towards Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who won the aerial challenge easily against Victor Lindel\u00f6f \u2013 he would bully the centre-back all game \u2013 and flicked on to Bernard. Aaron Wan-Bissaka hesitated and the Brazilian drilledhit a low shot between the legs of the full-back and just inside David de Gea\u2019s right post. United were undeterred and soon level. Ancelotti sensed danger as soon as Everton lost possession in central midfield and berated his players for allowing the visitors to pass through them too easily. They never got near a red shirt. Juan Mata released Luke Shaw on the left and his cross was delivered to perfection between Everton\u2019s central defenders. Fernandes, his run unchecked, ghosted into the chasm between Michael Keane and Mason Holgate to beat Pickford with a superb header. It should have been United\u2019s second but Anthony Martial squandered a gilt-edged chance moments before Bernard struck. Their second did arrive from a similar source, neat combinations prising open Everton\u2019s right flank before Fernandes converted, although on this occasion his finish was accidental. Marcus Rashford, thanked for his work on the school meal vouchers by the Everton Fans\u2019 Forum before kick-off, found Fernandes in space before darting into the area for the return ball. The cross sailed past his head but also beat Pickford via the inside of the far post. Everton\u2019s best opportunity for a second had come and gone by the time they fell behind. Bernard sent Lucas Digne racing into the United penalty area with an impudent reverse pass. Calvert-Lewin was unmarked in front of goal but the left-back took the shot himself and hit the outside of De Gea\u2019s near post with an angled drive. The striker was not amused and would be starved of service in front of goal throughout. Pickford dropped a Mata free-kick at the feet of Harry Maguire after being pushed by the United defender, who kneed the loose ball over the crossbar before taking a kick in the chest from the keeper. VAR ruled no penalty. Maguire was fortunate to escape punishment for a heavy challenge on Digne inside his area, taking the ball and the defender\u2019s ankle but being spared by an earlier offside call against Calvert-Lewin. Pickford saved a one-on-one with Rashford and Doucour\u00e9 missed two good chances to level late on. Fernandes and Cavani punished his second miss in emphatic style, allowing Solskj\u00e6r to turn his ire on the broadcasters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
