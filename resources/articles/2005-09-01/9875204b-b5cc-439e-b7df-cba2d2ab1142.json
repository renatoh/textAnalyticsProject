Already, 43% of school leavers are trotting off, student loan in hand, to one higher education institution or another. The baffling lectures, the dodgy housing, the thirteen and a half grand debt they will on average accrue are all considered to be worth it for the kudos a degree will confer. With much trumpeting about the \"knowledge economy\", the UK graduate population keeps growing. All of which has raised an almighty shrug from employers, it seems. The early findings from management consultancy KPMG's latest report on middle market business suggests that nearly two-thirds of them most value relevant work experience in entry-level recruitment. By contrast, only 9% considered a degree essential. If jobseekers are better with three years of work experience than three years in academia, do we have our priorities wrong? The very different fortunes of two 24-year-olds seem to suggest we might. Received wisdom says that Maddy Hodge, who has a 2:1 in French and Spanish, should be on the fast track to career success. By contrast, Jonny Gallant dropped out of his degree in social and management science a year before graduation and was told he was making a big mistake. But a year after graduation, Hodge doesn't think her degree has helped land her ideal job. \"It's like a promise - do a degree and you'll get a good job,\" she says. \"But a degree doesn't qualify you for anything. We weren't really told about this at the start. Most of my friends aren't now doing what they wanted.\" Hodge took languages after being told they were always in demand. She wants to work as a translator. \"But to be a translator you need a lot more experience and a vocational qualification,\" she explains. She joined an international clothes exporter as a telephonist on graduating, where she is now a dispatches supervisor. Gallant spent the years after leaving his course finding out what he did and didn't like. \"There's a lot of pressure to go to university, but I wasn't suited to it,\" he says. \"There wasn't a single aspect of it I found inspiring. I lost all motivation, and was working a 40-hour week in my student job because I found it more fulfilling. \"When I got a call from a friend at an events marketing company asking for help for a week, I took it. They asked me if I wanted to stay and I wound up being a project manager,\" he says. He also travelled in Australia, where he did telesales work. After returning, he tried estate agency, \"but that was destroying my soul\". A friend introduced him to Canongate Publishers, and he was taken on as a sales assistant for three months to cover sick leave. Nearly a year on, he is still there. Joining a dynamic, mid-size company can mean entry-level staff gain responsibilities and experience more quickly than in bigger organisations, but these jobs have their own pressures that students rarely think about. \"We just don't have the support to make specialist graduate entry schemes viable,\" says Rachel Roe, spokesperson for Egg, one of the UK's most successful online banks. \"The management team is very small. A lot of people have good degrees but you need something that demonstrates you work as dynamically as other members of that team. Work experience for us is the most important thing of all.\" But, points out Terry Jones of the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services, students aren't always willing or able to take on unpaid work experience. \"There are generally two different strategies among students,\" he says. \"The minority look at work experience from year two and view their university careers as vocational development. Others are more interested in the social side of things, and work to make money. \"The city firms will pay them to do work experience, but the smaller ones won't. That can be a block. So a lot of students do go in at admin-level jobs, and have to work their way up.\" Hodge thinks this is accurate: \"I just wish I had done different things at uni, volunteer work even. It was the vocational aspect that was missing.\" Roe points out that a small, close team such as that at Egg is also looking for a good cultural fit between company and recruit (29% of those in the KPMG survey thought this was the most important factor when hiring), and cites that as a reason why mid-size employers aren't too preoccupied with degrees. \"The culture is very different here from other banking organisations. It works much more like what you think of as a dotcom. We work at a fast rate, and we're only six years old,\" she says. Gallant points out that his work history helped to demonstrate what kind of an employee he would be. \"To some extent, jumping from job to job is seen as a negative thing, but it also shows adaptability, which Canongate liked because this was a job whose remits were very uncertain,\" he says. \"I don't think they were at all interested in my having a degree - it was more that I could talk passionately about books.\" But Jones believes it is also possible to use your time at university positively to explore your preferences. \"Pledging yourself to one company at the age of 18? Perhaps my generation would have bought it, but university looks attractive and more stable.\" Given their time again, would Hodge and Gallant do things differently? Although she wishes she had more practical experience, Hodge is rightly very proud of her academic achievements and says she had too much fun at university to regret going. And despite describing his time at university as \"time wasted\", Gallant is quick to point out that: \"I've never applied for a job I'd love if it's asking for graduates. I'm also the only person I know without a degree. There is still a stigma. But the more jobs I do, the less I feel it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
