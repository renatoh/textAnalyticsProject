Mark E Smith had already settled into the contrary, bile-spewing persona that persists to this day. The set included soon-to-be trademark examples of their influential Salford rumble with Repetition and Psycho Mafia. Drummer Steve Ormrod was ousted after the one appearance, setting in motion a revolving door of musicians that has never stopped. Fashions have changed, but Smith remains constant: indie's sneering, contemptuous conscience, a reminder that what matters is not the trousers or the haircuts, but the work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
