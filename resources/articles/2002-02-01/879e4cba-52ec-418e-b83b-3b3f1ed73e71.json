The matter is closed legally with the police but the club are likely to take disciplinary action if they find Bellamy guilty of misconduct. Nothing will be done, however, until Monday. \"Of course I expect a high standard of behaviour from my players,\" said Newcastle's manager Bobby Robson yesterday. \"But we'll get this game over with first and our investigation will then be ongoing.\" The minimum Bellamy can expect if found guilty is a fine of two weeks' wages. Bellamy, 22, is alleged to have kicked and punched Smith to the ground while in the company of his fellow Newcastle players, Kieron Dyer, Carl Cort and Wayne Quinn. The players had been out on Newcastle's Quayside, in the nightclub called Sea. Smith and two flatmates had been talking to the players in the nightclub but had then left to get a taxi when Dyer's silver Mercedes is said to have pulled up and offered them a lift to nearby St Peter's Basin, where Quinn has an apartment. It was outside it that the incident is said to have occurred. At 3.20am on Tuesday Smith made a complaint to Market Street police having checked the players' identities on a Newcastle United website, a friend told the Newcastle Evening Chronicle. \"Charlotte doesn't want to talk about what happened - it's too difficult,\" said the friend, who added that Dyer \"acted like a gentleman\". Bellamy, signed for \u00a36m from Coventry City last summer, has been a success this season but has upset the club, being sent home from Spain having failed to turn up for a dinner in honour of Sir John Hall. \u00b7 The Charity Shield is to be renamed the Community Shield next season by the Football Association as part of a plan to reward the approximately 250,000 volunteers who use their spare time to help the amateur game. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
