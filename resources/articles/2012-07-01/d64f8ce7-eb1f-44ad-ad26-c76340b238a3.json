The gangsta/rapper/actor's directing debut, Something From Nothing: The Art Of Rap, pulls on his many connections to give you a first-hand account of how hip-hop took over the world, and what inspired the great MCs. A few of them join Ice-T on stage at this Thursday's event and the event will be simulcast live to cinemas across the UK. HMV Apollo, W6, Thu; BFI Southbank, SE1, Fri The Luna Cinema, On tour Still waiting for the summer to start? Perhaps it will once this roving cinema event gets moving. It's the reliable formula: a big screen, a nice venue, a classic movie and the great unpredictable British outdoors. For example, Canterbury's ruined St Augustine's Abbey and The Goonies this Thursday, or south London's Brockwell Lido and Anchorman on Friday. Looking ahead, venues include scenic parks, castles and other landmarks, and the bill includes recent, universal crowd-pleasers like The Artist and O Brother, Where Art Thou? And, hedging their bets, Singin' In The Rain. Various venues, London, Surrey, Kent, Dorset, West Sussex, Thu to 22 Sep"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
