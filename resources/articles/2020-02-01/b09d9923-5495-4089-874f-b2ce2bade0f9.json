Horner is bullish about his team\u2019s chances but reckons Hamilton, who will be aiming for a seventh world crown, will remain with Mercedes rather than switch to Ferrari at the end of the season. Verstappen, 22 but entering his sixth F1 season, is convinced he is ready to take the fight to the British driver. Red Bull have not properly challenged Hamilton\u2019s dominant Mercedes team since the turbo\u2011hybrid era began. However, with the regulations stable, Horner is confident that if Red Bull deliver on their car his Dutch driver can be a threat. \u201cMax\u2019s wheel-to-wheel race craft is second to none. The only person I have seen Lewis make mistakes around is Max. Max is the coming man,\u201d Horner said. \u201cHe is 22 and on the ascendancy. Lewis is 35. It is inevitable in any sport there is always another generation coming and, with Max and [Ferrari\u2019s] Charles Leclerc, it is set for a really thrilling year. Of course Lewis also has all that experience and all those years of know-how. I think it is going to be a classic.\u201d Last year Verstappen won three races and finished third in the drivers\u2019 standings. Red Bull improved as the season progressed, as did their Honda engine, Verstappen closing out with four podiums from the final seven races. Expectations are high at Red Bull that they will start in their strongest position since 2014. \u201cWe want to be the team that puts a charge together,\u201d Horner said. \u201cThey still go into this championship as favourites but it would be phenomenal if we had a three-way battle between ourselves, Lewis, Charles and even Sebastian [Vettel], that would be fantastic for the sport and the fans, a stellar year.\u201d Hamilton was explicit last year that he gave Verstappen room on track, given the Dutchman\u2019s propensity for aggressive manoeuvres, which Horner insisted is one of Verstappen\u2019s assets. \u201cAny driver knows that Max will have a go,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is aggressive but he is also calculating in that aggression. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see many incidents last year at all. Even in Monaco he was still prepared to have a go, he wasn\u2019t prepared to sit and settle for second place. It\u2019s not in his DNA: his modus operandi is absolutely flat out and go for it.\u201d Hamilton\u2019s Mercedes contract is running down and he has been linked with a move to Ferrari but Horner expects him to remain with the team with whom he has won five of his six titles. \u201cBernie Ecclestone always used to say drivers want to end their career at Ferrari. I think that might be different in Lewis\u2019s case. He has been unconventional throughout his career. He seems happy in the environment he is in. If it is the most competitive environment why would he want to change that for the sake of driving in a different car?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
