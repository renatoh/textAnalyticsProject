Lazers Do", "bodyText": "What do you get if you Auto-Tune the sound of a baby? A ghostly and beautiful noise, as it happens, which turns up on the penultimate song of this kaleidoscopic and rambunctious album. Sadly, the men behind Major Lazer - dance producers Diplo (Philadelphia's Wesley Pentz) and Switch (London's Dave Taylor) - opt to end their most striking musical idea after just one minute. But then, they have a right to be confident. Their debut is a genre-destroying mix of innovations which entirely depends on a refusal to settle for any one trademark sound. A bit like a Basement Jaxx album remixed by hyperactive hooligan children. The loose concept behind the project involves the imaginary Major Lazer, a one-armed Jamaican ex-commando and nightclub owner who battles the forces of darkness. Gorillaz-style cartoon videos are on their way, but it's all essentially a wacky front for two deliberately faceless producers and a slew of vocalists. While Diplo's clubland background lies in baile funk and Miami bass, and Switch is the don of the electro micro-genre known as fidget house, the two are best-known for their work on the globally informed pop of MIA and Santogold. They figured it might be a nice idea to go to Bob Marley's Tuff Gong studios in Kingston and revive dancehall reggae for British club kids reared on twitchy electro-disco. They've pulled it off spectacularly well. The ominous Anything Goes (featuring Turbulence) is a 21st-century spaghetti western theme, while highlight Cash Flow sees Jah Dan pinpoint the meaninglessness of money without freedom and spiritual awareness. It's pure old-school rasta preaching, but, in recession-hit 2009, his sweetly sung pleas sound like the essence of reason. The meat of Guns Don't Kill... is in its first six tracks, where Santogold joins a set of excellent Jamaican vocalists in a bravura splicing of traditional reggae with upfront disco beats. Single Hold the Line features the gruff voice of Mr Lex and aims to make us \"vibrate like a Nokia\" by way of surf guitar, whinnying horses, chirping phones, ringing cash registers, gated dancehall drums and a sample of Santogold's voice providing a percussive stutter. If Guns Don't Kill... is less substantial on tracks such as the pornographic Bruk Out, there's still enough pleasure in the borderline insanity that sees Diplo and Switch fusing R&amp;B, Euro-house, reggae and Latin on Keep It Goin Louder to make your jaw drop at the cheek of it all. Because Major Lazer's major achievement lies in pulling this rampant eclecticism off without a hint of smugness or self-importance. By virtue of its sheer irreverence, Guns Don't Kill... seems to encapsulate everything you always loved about reggae, and perhaps thought had disappeared.
