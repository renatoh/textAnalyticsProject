Those are just the ones we know about. In this context it was tempting to ask the new man in charge: \"So, Alan, does it feel like your team yet?\" Even Kenny Dalglish's imprint is still on a side who are 18th in the Premier League table, three points short of safety. Steve Harper, the goalkeeper, was signed from Seaham Red Star in 1993 but took five years to break into the first team. During that long apprenticeship Dalglish stopped him from signing for Huddersfield. For Shearer's debut there was an astounding array of human elements thrown together from old regimes, some of them so freshly discarded that Wise, who was instrumental in the acquisitions last summer of Jon\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez, Fabricio Coloccini and Xisco (for \u00a35.7m), is thought to still be on Mike Ashley's pay-roll. At the heart of midfield was a solid Robson buy, Nicky Butt, and an emergency Kinnear acquisition in Kevin Nolan, who was replaced by another former Bolton Wanderer, Danny Guthrie. At full-back were Jos\u00e9 'The Bull' Enrique, bought two years ago by Allardyce for \u00a36.3m, and Ryan Taylor, who was a makeweight in the deal that took Charles N'Zogbia to Wigan. In central defence Chelsea bore down on the Allardyce-buy, Habib Beye, and the Wise-Jimenez inspired purchase, Coloccini, who contrived to be at fault three times for Frank Lampard's opening goal. Coloccini is the only Newcastle player to have appeared in all 31 league games this season, which, on Saturday's evidence, is a further worrying sign. On the wings were Guti\u00e9rrez, who tried hard enough without inflicting damage, and Peter Lovenkrands, who arrived from Schalke 04 in January and departed with a nasty midriff injury to be replaced by Damien Duff, whose own infirmities have deprived him of the speed to dash past opponents, which is quite a handicap for a winger. At the tip of the team, Obafemi Martins was snuffed out by John Terry and Alex, and Michael Owen was compelled to spend much of the game in midfield, as Shearer conceded, to provide a short pass out of trouble when Lampard, Michael Essien and Mikel John Obi were trying to annex the centre of the pitch. On the bench, unused, were Alan Smith and Geremi. Missing, through injury, were the two best defenders, Steven Taylor and S\u00e9bastien Bassong. In another dimension altogether were Xisco, who has made four starts since joining the club, and Mark Viduka, who has made one start this term. This autopsy of a campaign that has yielded only six wins confirms the mismatched and patched-up nature of the squad Shearer has inherited, and it explains why Newcastle's fans were so subdued for the saviour's premiere, which, to his credit, he stripped of all pretensions by arriving in the dug-out like an auditor in town to examine some accounts. With West Bromwich Albion and Middlesbrough so obviously imperilled, Shearer's lucrative task is also brutally simple: to cause, by powers of motivation and organisation, Newcastle United to finish 17th rather than 18th, possibly at the expense of Sunderland, which would raise morale in the city no end. The next seven games will provide no thinking time in which to imagine Newcastle trotting out in 2009\u20132010 transformed. \"Begin afresh, afresh\" intoned Philip Larkin, whose home city, Hull, are also in the soup. But neutrals and some sympathetic Chelsea fans were asking: even if he keeps them up and stays on, does Shearer own a wrecking ball big enough to reconstruct this disparate squad? Assuming he has the inclination."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
