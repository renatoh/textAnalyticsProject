The rumoured deal \u2013 reported by TV Line\u2019s Michael Ausiello, a longtime TV reporter for Entertainment Weekly \u2013 calls for four 90-minute episodes. Sherman-Palladino and her husband, executive producer Daniel Palladino, created the show, which ran from 2000 to 2006, and were largely responsible for most of the caffeine-laden banter of a town of quirky characters, led by single mother Lorelai Gilmore and her daughter, Rory, played by Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel. The show aired on the WB network from 2000-2005, and moved \u2013 without its creators \u2013 to the CW in 2006, then a nascent network formed from the combination of the WB and UPN. Ausiello reports that Bledel and Graham are both expected back for the revival, along with Kelly Bishop and Scott Patterson. Unmentioned are Jared Padalecki and Matt Czuchry, who both played romantic interests to Bledel\u2019s Rory and who are both starring on other TV series \u2013 Padalecki on Supernatural, and Czuchry on The Good Wife. Also unnamed was Melissa McCarthy, who played the best friend to Graham\u2019s Lorelai before her career took off as the star of Hollywood comedies. Edward Herrmann, who played Richard Gilmore, died in December. Much of the cast reunited in June at the ATX television festival, at which they speculated on where their characters might be now. The last audiences saw of Rory Gilmore, she was graduating from Yale having just dumped her college beau, played by Czuchry, in order to become a journalist covering the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama. The show was known for its oddball guest appearances from the world of politics \u2013 including former secretary of state Madeleine Albright \u2013 so it seems almost entirely possible that in 2015 we might find Rory nearing 30 and covering the presidential campaign of another secretary of state: Hillary Clinton. Netflix said they would not comment on the rumours."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
