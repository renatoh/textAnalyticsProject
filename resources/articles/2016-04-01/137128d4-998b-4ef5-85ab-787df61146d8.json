Those who built their wealth on commodities such as oil and steel suffered multi-billion pound falls as rock-bottom prices ate into their personal assets. But there were big rises for property tycoons, including the latest table-toppers, the Reuben brothers, while the list was gatecrashed by new entrants such as Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton and Sacha Baron-Cohen, the comedian and actor behind Ali G and Borat. Sibling property investors David and Simon Reuben, who made their first fortune purchasing Russian aluminium before buying up large tracts of London\u2019s landmark buildings, reached the summit of the annual Sunday Times rich list of Britain\u2019s 1,000 wealthiest people with a combined fortune of \u00a313.1bn, after climbing four places in a year. Sri and Gopi Hinduja \u2013 also brothers \u2013 finished a close second with \u00a313bn, leapfrogging last year\u2019s richest man, the Warner Music Group owner, Len Blavatnik. The tycoon, born in Odessa, Ukraine, fell two places to third as his wealth slumped by \u00a31.6bn to \u00a311.6bn. While the combined worth of Britain\u2019s billionaires grew by nearly 6% to \u00a3344bn, Blavatnik\u2019s fate was mirrored by a host of ultra-wealthy business people. Steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal and family, who in 2008 boasted a \u00a327.7bn fortune that outstripped any in British history, saw his wealth decline by \u00a32bn last year to \u00a37.1bn. Mittal\u2019s wealth was affected by the ongoing crisis in the steel industry, which has claimed more than 5,000 jobs in Britain alone over the past year. The Chelsea FC owner, Roman Abramovich, who made his fortune through his Russian oil business Sibneft, witnessed his worth fall by \u00a3890m to \u00a36.4bn. The Sports Direct and Newcastle United owner, Mike Ashley, who has been rocked by a Guardian investigation into working conditions in his retail empire, was among the biggest losers, as his personal pot shrank by \u00a31.1bn to \u00a32.4bn. Fellow retail tycoon Sir Philip Green suffered a \u00a3280m decline to \u00a33.2bn after a year in which he sold the BHS high street chain for \u00a31, only to watch it plummet towards an administration process likely to begin on Monday. The single biggest loss of wealth affected Carrie and Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo and family, whose value is built on Franco-British oil firm Perenco. Their combined assets tumbled \u00a32.45bn to \u00a33.35bn amid persistently low oil prices. Hefty losses among some of Britain\u2019s richest people meant that the number of billionaires in the UK increased by just three to 120, the slowest rate of growth since the financial crisis, when their ranks dwindled from 75 to 43 in 2009. And while London remains the world\u2019s preferred playground for billionaires, boasting more than any other city, there were three fewer than last year at 77. The annual list of Britain\u2019s ultra-wealthy also boasted some spectacular rises, such as that of Sir James Dyson, the inventor famed for his bagless vacuum cleaner, among other creations. His household goods and technology business reported profits of \u00a3448m last year, with salaries and dividends boosting the Dyson family\u2019s wealth by \u00a31.5bn to \u00a35bn. Perhaps the most remarkable rise was staged by the little-known brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who were leasing a single dilapidated garage in Bury just 15 years ago. The pair have since built an empire worth \u00a3700m by buying and renovating service stations to create a 341-strong chain of Euro Garages. They soared 473 places to 164th as their fortune increased by \u00a3550m to \u00a3700m. Britain\u2019s richest woman is Kirsty Bertarelli, the former Miss UK and would-be pop star who, with her husband, the pharmaceutical billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli, has a combined worth \u00a39.8bn, making them the richest husband and wife team. The wealthiest self-made businesswoman in the UK is Denise Coates, who built the Bet365 business with her family, amassing a combined worth of nearly \u00a33.8bn. The Queen, who celebrated her 90th birthday last week, saw her wealth remain flat at \u00a3340m but dropped 17 places in the list to equal 319th. The sum puts her on level pegging with the entertainment mogul Simon Cowell, the man behind The X Factor and Britain\u2019s Got Talent. New entries included Baron-Cohen, who made his name with his Ali G character and this year released Grimsby, his first film in a decade. Together with his wife, the former soap opera star Isla Fisher, the 44-year-old is worth \u00a3105m, putting him 936th in Britain. Lewis Hamilton was another new entry and Britain\u2019s richest sportsman with a fortune of \u00a3106m. Pop star Adele saw her personal worth soar by \u00a335m to \u00a385m, while there was no surprise that the wealthiest band were One Direction, worth a combined \u00a3132m. Overall, the 1,000 wealthiest people in Britain are worth a combined \u00a3576bn, an increase of \u00a328.5bn on last year, which equality campaigners said amounted to an increase of \u00a3901 every second. The Equality Trust pointed out that the wealth of the richest 1,000 was the same as that owned by the poorest 40% in the UK. They said the increase in the worth of rich list members could have paid for everyone in Britain\u2019s council tax, a year\u2019s rent for 3m households or 1.8m jobs on the living wage. \u201cThe level of inequality in the UK is both completely unjustifiable and hugely damaging for society,\u201d said John Hood, acting director. \u201cA wealth of evidence now shows us that living in a more unequal country means you\u2019re more likely to suffer from poor mental and physical health, have poorer education, trust people less, be the victim of violent crime and even die earlier. It\u2019s not good enough for politicians to repeatedly fail to act on this.\u201d Many of the rich list members chose to use their wealth to fund the Conservative party, with only eight out of the top 50 political donors spurning the Tories. But the Conservatives were denied the two biggest political donations, with the media mogul Richard Desmond handing \u00a31m to Ukip and EuroMillions lottery winners Colin and Chris Weir giving \u00a31m of their \u00a3153m winnings to the Scottish National party during the year.
