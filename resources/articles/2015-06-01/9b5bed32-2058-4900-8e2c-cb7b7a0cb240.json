Nehemiah Fischer, an assistant pastor in Tulsa, was fatally shot Friday by troopers after they helped him and his brother, Brandon Fischer, when their truck became trapped by floodwaters. Police did not initially release much information about the incident, saying only a \u201cconfrontation\u201d had occurred. His wife, Laura, told local media over the weekend that her husband and his brother \u201cwould not have gone after the trooper\u201d. A friend, Mike Haesloop, told the Guardian that Fisher was \u201cnot the kind of guy that\u2019s going to pull a gun on anybody\u201d. On Monday, OHP spokesman Paul Timmons said that when ordered to get out of the floodwaters on Friday, the Fischers walked toward the troopers and Nehemiah Fischer shoved one trooper to the ground. Fischer then was shot. Timmons showed video of the incident, but only one trooper is visible after the scuffle begins. His gun was raised, and OHP is investigating how many shots were fired. Timmons told the Guardian that a gun was recovered from Fisher\u2019s body. \u201cI can\u2019t verify whether it was being brandished but the deceased individual did have a handgun,\u201d he said. Brandon Fischer was arrested for assault and public intoxication. On Monday, Fischer\u2019s father, JR Fischer, told the Associated Press that Nehemiah Fischer was not capable of violence and respected law enforcement, and was a man of God who studied the Bible daily.
