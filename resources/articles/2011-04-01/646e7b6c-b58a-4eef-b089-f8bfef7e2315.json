By coming to terms with that fact that you were actually dead for the 13bn years before you were born and it didn't cause you the slightest bit of inconvenience. Tom Crask, Abingdon, Oxon Fear of death is a contradiction in terms: surely you must be extant (which will patently no longer be the case) in order to fear non-existence? Therefore, don't worry about being dead, because you won't know anything about it. What you are really concerned about is the act of dying. Be guided by Montaigne who, following a near-death experience in his youth, reflected in later years: \"If you don't know how to die, don't worry; Nature will tell you what to do on the spot, fully and adequately. She will do this job perfectly for you; don't bother your head about it.\" Dave Paterson, London NW4 The cessation of consciousness means that \"you\" are not there when it happens. Wittgenstein puts it best: \"Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experience death.\" One may (rationally) fear illness and pain and increasing decrepitude or the dreaded dementia; but one should not fear death. Of course I realise this solace only works for atheists. If you are burdened by the terrors of an afterlife, you must seek comfort elsewhere. Francis Blake, London N17 By bearing in mind that \"Cowards die many times before their deaths, the valiant never taste of death but once\" (Julius Caesar). Pete Whittle, Canterbury, Kent Develop a belief in some form of reincarnation or spiritual afterlife. Failing that, repeat the following: \"You die if you worry. You die if you don't. So why worry at all?\" Live long and prosper. Fred Huckle, London SW1 The antidote for fear is wisdom, so age should solve your problem. Dave Windsor, Brighton You probably can't. We were built to survive, so fear of death is inevitable. The obvious answer is to get a life. Ruby Elliot, London N8 I received an email last week saying that my message was undeliverable \u2013 but I sent the email in April 2006! Where has it been for the past five years? How many miles has it covered in cyberspace? Probably none. Most mail servers will try to pass the message on to the receiving server over a protocol called smtp. If for some reason the receiving server can't be contacted immediately, the local server will try to resend it every few hours before it eventually gives up and puts the message in a \"bad\" queue. What happens next depends on how the particular server is set up. In your case it probably sat there for nearly five years till the administrator finally came along, noticed the size the bad queue had grown to and decided to reprocess it, finally releasing the message so it could complete its journey. If your mail program allows you to view the emails headers, they will contain a precise log of exactly where it has been and for how long, so technically we don't even need to speculate. James Zigrino, Edinburgh Since when have rooms had skirting boards and why? Skirting boards are aesthetically pleasing and give a room a visual solidity \u2013 we used to have regard for finishing things off properly with cornices, coving, parapets and so on. More practically, it would have made life easier for a plasterer, not having to be too precise about the bottom edge of the wall and had the added advantage of making a nice little run for the mice. Vivienne Cox, London W4 Cheese is delicious, very popular and involves a lot of time and expertise to make. Why, then, is the word \"cheesy\" derogative? Fats break down, into butyric and isovaleric acids; this gives flavour and odour to butter and cheese, and to the fat produced by our sweat glands \u2013 hence the odour of cheesy feet. A cheesy grin is probably due to the likeness of the smile to a slice of cheese. Norman Nicolson, London E4 Perhaps it's because you say \"cheese\" when you smile falsely for the camera. So an insincere smile becomes cheesy; from that anything shallow, phony or meretricious. Pat Horrocks, Harrogate, N Yorks Any answers? Into what is the universe expanding?
