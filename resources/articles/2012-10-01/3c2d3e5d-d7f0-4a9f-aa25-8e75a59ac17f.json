Not so. Theatre is still mostly created, and watched, by the white middle class. As a result, actor-turned-writer Nathaniel Martello-White has penned the satirical Blackta, a talent-contest scenario exposing the reality of trying to make it as a black actor: the crazy auditions, the competitiveness and rivalries between friends fighting it out for roles, and the fitness regimes. Old Vic artistic director David Lan guides a cast led by Anthony Welsh, who appeared in The Brothers Size and Sucker Punch, and Javone Prince of E4's PhoneShop. Young Vic, SE1, Fri to 17 Nov Mark Cook Sitelines Festival, Reading Reading just got a whole lot more interesting with the arrival of a new festival with some of theatre's rising stars, set in locations including a garage, an office, a pub and a car park. There's genuinely ground-breaking theatre in the programme including Action Hero's A Western (South Street Arts Centre, 2-3 Nov) which delves into the myths of the wild west. Don't miss Chris Thorpe and Hannah Jane Walker's funny and moving The Oh Fuck Moment (Jelly, 30 Oct), which asks whether we are the sum, not of our triumphs, but our mistakes. Also check out Made In China's Stationary Excess (South Street Arts Centre, 31 Oct). The festivities start with ShadyJane's 2011 Edinburgh hit Sailing On (Abbey School, Wed), performed in a ladies' lavatory. Various venues, to 4 Nov; book via readingarts.com Lyn Gardner The Horror! The Horror! London As Halloween approaches, a number of theatres are hoping to put the frighteners on us. Wilton's Music Hall is the perfect venue for creepy goings-on and offers The Horror! The Horror!, a co-production with Theatre Of The Damned (creators of the hit Grand Guignol) that's an immersive promenade through the vaults and chambers of the building, set in 1904. The combination of twisted music hall, the writings of HP Lovecraft, and Victorian gothic should make for a chilling mix. Also worth looking out for: Soho Theatre once again hosts its annual festival of horror Terror 2012: All In The Mind (Sat to 3 Nov), a collection of four new shiver-inducing plays produced by The Sticking Place. Wilton's Music Hall, E1, Wed to 7 Nov MC The Dark At The Top Of The Stairs, Coventry In the late 1950s William Inge was as well known in his native America as Tennessee Williams. But while Williams remains much produced across the world (West Yorkshire Playhouse is reviving Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, to 27 Oct; the Royal Exchange in Manchester has Orpheus Descending, Wed to 24 Nov), Inge's plays are far less often performed, with the exception of Bus Stop, made famous in a movie version starring Marilyn Monroe. Not seen in the UK for many years, The Dark At The Top Of The Stairs is set in 1920s Oklahoma. But it is not a beautiful morning for the Flood family who are forced to accept that the world is changing very fast and they must adapt or die. Belgrade Theatre, to 10 Nov LG Macbeth, Belfast Lynne Parker's revival of Shakespeare's bloody supernatural tale is given a Northern Irish twist in a production which applies the Ulster idiom to Macbeth's rise and fall. The production is part of the Ulster Bank Belfast Festival At Queens which has a lively theatre-lineup, including NTS's Enquirer (Lesley Buildings, Fri to 4 Nov), about newspaper journalists; Fishamble's Silent (Waterfront Studio, Mon to Wed); and the remarkable Belarus Free Theatre's furious, heart-breaking Minsk 2011 (Lyric Studio, 31 Oct-3 Nov), a show that equates sex with scars, both physical and on the psyche. Lyric Theatre, Thu to 24 Nov LG 'Tis Pity She's A Whore, Bristol First seen out on tour and at the Barbican last year, Cheek By Jowl's acclaimed production of John Ford's bloody 17th-century drama about incest and obsession returns to the UK with dates at Bristol Old Vic and Nottingham's Theatre Royal (6-10 Nov). Set in the teenage Annabella's bedroom, the production excavates the decadence of corruption and immorality which lurks behind the facade of polite Italian society as Annabella's brother Giovanni declares his love for his sister and starts an incestuous relationship with her. Cheek By Jowl has been been producing acclaimed work for more than 30 years under the direction of Declan Donnellan, a director with an sharp eye for new acting talent, and it's safe to say that there will be nothing dusty about this revival of a visceral Jacobean thriller. Bristol Old Vic, Wed to 3 Nov LG DanceLive 2012, Aberdeen Now in its seventh year, Scotland's leading contemporary dance festival shows its form with stimulating small- and large-scale work. A highlight this week is David Hughes Dance performing The Chinaski Sessions (Lemon Tree, Thu), a new work by Kylie Walters, inspired by Charles Bukowski's heavily self-referring antihero Hank Chinaski. The scenario is a rock band trapped in a studio, trying to finish a new album. Live music from Belgian duo I Love Sarah fuels five male dancers through a drama of debauchery, vulnerability and revelation, unravelling at speed. Various venues, Tue to 31 Oct Judith Mackrell Phoenix Dance Theatre, London In its 31-year history Phoenix has undergone drastic reincarnations, but new director Sharon Watson is opting for a more organic change of image, programming work closely connected to the company. Watson's choreography features in a new work Melt, inspired by the music of Wild Beasts; and former Phoenix dancer Ana Luj\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez returns with new work Catch, inspired by surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte. There's a revival of Henri Oguike's wonderful 2004 Signal; plus Kwesi Johnson's SoundClash, a hip-hop inflected piece whose moves respond to the complex patterns of sound waves. Linbury Studio Theatre, WC2, Thu to 27 Dec; touring to 4 Dec JM"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
