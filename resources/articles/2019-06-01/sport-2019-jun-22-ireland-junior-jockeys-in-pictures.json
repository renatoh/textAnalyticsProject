Around the end of August each year, the fledgling jockeys of the horse and pony circuit descend on this fabled white strand outside the village of Ballyferriter in West Kerry. They ride horses that tend to be either young and excitable or old and stubborn. They show the vivacious colours of their racing silks against skies that sit as often as not greyly over the mountains of the Dingle peninsula and the cold waters of Smerwick Harbour. This is horse racing in a pure, amateur form, and at a meeting like this you can\u2019t help feeling it belongs to an older and better world than ours. The young jockeys have about them an air of intensity and a sense of lasered focus that lifts them directly out of childhood and adolescence \u2013 you recognise at once that these are serious operators, and this is a serious game. \u201cI\u2019m 10 years of age now,\u201d says Dylan O\u2019Connor from Liscarroll in County Cork, \u201cbut I started off with the horses when I was about two and a half.\u201d He rode in just the one race at Ballyferriter last summer, but it went well enough. \u201cI came in second, I was about two lengths back,\u201d he says. \u201cThe horse was a fairly old fella, so he was grand, you know? You wouldn\u2019t be nervous getting up on him at all.\u201d Whenever he gets the chance, and whatever the season, Dylan is away with the horses. \u201cI\u2019d always get out on a Saturday, but hopefully I\u2019d be out in the week as well,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd at home I\u2019d be watching it on the television a fair bit. I\u2019d be looking out for jockeys like Jack Kennedy or Ruby.\u201d In Ireland, the jockey Ruby Walsh tends to pass as a one-name entity; he is a key figure in the pantheon of native heroes for the young riders. And you have to start young \u2013 in truth, you\u2019d want to be of veteran stock before secondary school to be seen as a real proposition. If you go well at the likes of Ballyferriter, the entire world of racing might open up to you. \u201cYou have to be 16 for the track racing,\u201d Dylan says. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something I\u2019d be thinking about.\u201d At 14, Daniel King, from Kilbrin in County Cork, is nearer still to the age when professional racing might become a reality. \u201cI\u2019m on racehorses since I was 11,\u201d he says, \u201cand I\u2019m doing the point-to-points now as well. I started racing ponies when I was about nine, I suppose.\u201d This wasn\u2019t his first appearance at Ballyferriter \u2013 he is already a seasoned familiar of the strand, and the 2018 meeting went markedly well for him. \u201cI think I had seven winners... I know that I won the first five races. But the horses I had were good enough now, to be honest, and I\u2019d have expected to go well.\u201d He knows exactly the discipline that\u2019s required should the professional game become a reality (\u201cMy weight\u2019s all right at this stage, anyway!\u201d) but the attraction of racing overrides all else. \u201cAh, it\u2019s a very exciting thing, yeah. Definitely you\u2019d miss it if you\u2019re away from it for any length of time.\u201d Racing horses is a kind of glorious infection, and once you\u2019ve got the bug, there is no reliable cure. Alan Powdrill, the photographer who took these portraits, stumbled upon the Ballyferriter scene while on a road trip down Ireland\u2019s Atlantic coast last summer. \u201cI saw a poster for the races in a bar and thought I\u2019d go out and take a look. And I knew straight away it was gold. I hadn\u2019t realised it was going to be all these young kids racing.\u201d The fact of a typically overcast day in West Kerry was ideal. \u201cI knew if I used a flash, I could really make the colours pop.\u201d The meeting at Ballyferriter is one of many organised by the Horse and Pony Racing Association (Southern Section). There are meetings at Ballingarry in County Limerick, another beach meeting at Ballyheigue in Kerry, another at Allihies way out at the tip of the Beara peninsula in West Cork, and many others. They are held on fields and stretches of sand that have very often been the sites of horse races for hundreds of years. Many of the famous Irish jockeys have come through from the ranks of the HPRA meets \u2013 Norman Williamson, Wayne Lordan, Kate O\u2019Brien. If you can keep manners on a jerky two-year-old across the sands of B\u00e9al B\u00e1n, nothing that Aintree or Cheltenham can throw up should faze you. I\u2019ve been around racing people a bit over the last few years, researching a film script. I have found among them no more than a grudging acknowledgment that there is such a thing as life beyond the racing of horses, but how dull and inert it must be, and why would you even bother? This is very much a tribe, and there are particular tribal instincts. Even with jockeys as young as these, there is a lovely kind of reticence, or modesty. There is no big talk. The victories are worn lightly; the defeats are all the more frequent and are suffered without complaint. It is a sport with a tacit magic made of the trust that develops between jockey and horse, the silent agreement that they can only get through this thing together. On days like this at Ballyferriter, the peninsula might seem to be en f\u00eate \u2013 the chip vans are out, and the bouncy castles \u2013 but when it gets down to the hard business of racing, the attention is intense and deeply serious, and nothing, but nothing quickens the blood like the roaring thunder of a galloping pack across the compacted sands. This is inarguably the kingly sport, even still, and there isn\u2019t a corner of the earth where it is more important to the texture of life; neither is there a place where the riders are more revered. \u2022 Kevin Barry\u2019s new novel Night Boat To Tangier is out this week. His racing script, The Gee Gees, is in development with Element Pictures.
