Anti-fascists from Richmond and Charlottesville publicly advised supporters to avoid the rally altogether, citing serious safety concerns. Molly Conger, a journalist and activist, told the Guardian activists in Charlottesville had agreed to encourage supporters to stay away. \u201cThere is no counter-demonstration planned for the 20 January convergence of armed militias on Virginia\u2019s capitol,\u201d Conger wrote on Twitter on Saturday. \u201cConditions [on] Monday will not be safe. This is not an outcome we can affect.\u201d Anti-fascist groups cited several reasons for their decision, including serious threats of violence, their own opposition to some gun control measures proposed by the Virginia government and concern for ordinary gun owners planning to attend the rally. A number of arrests have highlighted the risk of white supremacist violence at the event. Among those arrested are alleged members of a neo-Nazi group, including men who reportedly discussed opening fire at the Richmond rally, and men who were charged with plotting to murder an antifascist couple in Georgia. As white supremacists, militia groups and conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones announced plans to attend, the event has drawn comparisons to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in August 2017, which produced extensive violence and the murder of counter-protester Heather Heyer. Some local activists who monitor the far right, however, said there were clear differences this time. \u201cThe Charlottesville event was, from the beginning, an event by neo-Nazis and for neo-Nazis,\u201d a Twitter account run anonymously by a longtime Richmond anti-fascist activist said on Saturday. \u201cThere were no other players. Everyone going into that event knew exactly who would be participating and there wasn\u2019t the risk of 5,000 unknowing subjects caught in the middle.\u201d In contrast, Monday is Lobby Day, an annual event organized by a gun rights group, the Virginia Citizens Defense League, that attracts a range of local residents. \u201cI expect a lot of the participants to be older, working class Virginians that are not far-right and do not fit into the category of any hate group,\u201d the anonymous anti-fascist activist who runs the Richmond Twitter account told the Guardian. \u201cPart of the concern is their safety.\u201d The activist said many locals showing up to the rally will likely have had no experience with volatile protest environments. As conspiracy theories about what \u201cantifa\u201d activists might do at Lobby Day continue to circulate on the right, one Richmond-based anti-fascist group has publicly pushed back against such rumors. \u201cHey! Antifascists are NOT bussing [people] in,\u201d Antifa Seven Hills wrote on Twitter. \u201cIn fact we are encouraging folks to stay away from the capitol and downtown [Richmond] because of far-right escalations like this.\u201d In a direct message, the group told the Guardian: \u201cWe are against the [gun control] legislation and the racists attempting to take advantage of this typically calm and multi-issue lobby day.\u201d Skepticism about government gun control is a point of agreement between rightwing activists and some US leftists, who argue that marginalized Americans should have the right to defend themselves with firearms. Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, said last week his supporters had been told antifa \u201cis actually on our side of the fence, because they don\u2019t like these gun laws either\u201d. \u201cIf they show, it\u2019s not going to be to protest us,\u201d Van Cleave told the Guardian on Wednesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
