I love cuddling, especially in the morning, and I do it for as long as I can get it. I find breakfast makes you hungry for lunch, lunch for dinner... and it all makes you overweight. So I start to eat after 12 o'clock. For lunch I like corned beef, white rice and fried onions, which I've eaten for as long as I can remember. My father used to make it; now, no one does it like me. My evening meal will be something like lamb roasted by my wife with probably the best lager in the world - Heineken. I also drink lots of water. Most of the planet is covered with water, so there must be a clue to its worth in that fact. Usually it's tap water because it isn't as old as bottled water. I buy biltong for a snack, from Harrods, since it is healthier than crisps. I also like salt beef and I have lots of vegetables. Cucumbers, organic carrot juice, and broccoli are favourites. Broccoli is not as bad as people make out. It might give you wind, but I'd prefer to have wind and have good health. Health is the number one thing on the planet. However, I am quite partial to rum and raisin ice cream. I'm finding that the issue of gaining weight is becoming more important as I get older. I used to have a 12-pack and now it's gone down to a nine-and-a-half-pack. Mind you, I watched myself being pulled into a meat wagon [arrested] after I protested about the Iraq war and I didn't look too bad. My back and my neck looked good. I've been thinking of late that since I stopped boxing I like food much more. It might be because I have more time to eat. Actually I'm quite hungry now... I never used to get hungry. I never used to be a food person. I've became a coffee drinker since I gave up boxing. I also love to eat anything cooked by a Jamaican. Carbs like rice, yellow yam, Renta yam, sweet yam. Also salt fish fried with onions... Oh yes, I am hungry...' \u00b7 Interview by Chloe Diski Is Chris's basket up to scratch? Salt fish Fish is a decent food, though this is pretty much bereft of the beneficial omega-3 fats. Oily fish such as salmon, trout, mackerel and sardine would be a better catch for Chris. Yam Compared to the potato, yam releases its sugar much more slowly into the bloodstream. This means it is less likely to lead to surges of insulin. White rice Now that Chris's life is more sedentary, the fast-sugar-releasing nature of this food will tend to encourage the laying down of fat in his body. Brown rice would be better. Heineken Beer is often seen as a contributory factor in the weight gain men may experience as they age. On the plus side, studies show that up to an intake of about three units a day, Chris's Heineken habit is unlikely to speed the decline of his nine-and-a-half-pack. Broccoli Broccoli is rich in disease-protective nutrients including indole-3-carbinol which has been linked with a reduced risk of disease including prostate cancer. Rum and raisin ice cream The tubful of refined sugar in ice cream means that it is a food generally best left out in the cold. Lamb Lamb is one of the less intensively farmed meats, and I therefore see it as a superior choice to most chicken and pork for this reason. Corned beef Corned beef contains no corn, but has added sugar and salt, and may also contain the preservative sodium nitrite that has been linked with an increased risk of cancer. Fresh, rather than tinned, meat would almost certainly be a better bet. Biltong I'm a big believer in keeping the diet based on primal foods and, in this respect, biltong fits the bill. A good snack for carnivore Chris and Atkins diet devotees everywhere."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
