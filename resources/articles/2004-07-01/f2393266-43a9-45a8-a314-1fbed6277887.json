Some had been grounded even as Jan Koller attempted to re-start the game, though no one felt the pain of this defeat more acutely than the playmaker limping off the bench. This may prove to be Pavel Nedved's final game for the Czech Republic and, if it is, then this was no way for the European footballer of the year to go out. His side never recovered from his withdrawal after 39 minutes, missing his inspiration on the left flank and the alarm his presence has sent shivering through opposing ranks since he burst on to the scene at Euro 96. Nedved, and his team-mate Karel Poborsky, were expected to retire from the international game after this tournament, though both thought they might go out on a victorious note. \"We are desperately disappointed with the result, but that's all,\" said their deadpan coach Karel Bruckner in the aftermath. \"I have told the boys that I am proud of every one of them and our captain Pavel Nedved has told them in the dressing room that this is the best international team he has ever played with.\" They can take hope from that, though today this may be an international team whose best player has retired. The tournament has been unkind to galacticos, but whereas most of the elite have self-destructed and warrant little sympathy the 31-year-old will be justified in wondering this morning what he has done to deserve this. Christian Vieri, Ra\u00fal, Alessandro del Piero and David Beckham have failed because of poor form; Nedved has arguably been robbed by ill luck. The decisive moment in this contest was its final agonising flick, but the key came after 34 minutes. Tomas Rosicky crossed from the right and Nedved attempted to spear the Czechs ahead from close range only to connect with his smothering marker Konstantinos Katsouranis's backside. His knee twisted, the player fell and a country cursed. For a while it appeared as if there might be hope of an immediate return, the captain anxious to leap from his stretcher and trotting eagerly around the touchline towards the dug-out. But his reintroduction contributed little more than one anxious jump, the discomfort obvious, the pain desperate. His substitution prompted a wail of anguish from the midfielder and tears to sting his eyes. Sitting in the dug-out with an ice pack on his knee, the darling of Czech football cut an inconsolable figure. For the captain the sense of anticlimax was familiar. A petty foul, committed against Real Madrid's Steve McManaman in the Champions League semi-final of 2003, cost him a place in the final against Milan at Old Trafford. Juventus lost on penalties and the suspicion was then that Nedved's, for all the domestic titles he has won with Juve and Lazio in Italy, might be a destiny unfulfilled. He appeared briefly at the end here, attempting to console distraught team-mates as he hobbled around the prone figures, though he was suffering most of all. Perhaps he had been holding himself back, aware of the booking picked up against Jesper Gronkjaer in the quarter-final which Uefa refused to rescind despite television replays suggesting the Dane had dived. That is irrelevant now. Even from a position out on the left, Nedved is integral to this Czech side and they laboured without him here, eventually stuttering to defeat. \"I missed the Champions League final and had to watch it from the sidelines, and I couldn't cope with that happening again,\" he had said at the team's base in Sintra, almost prophetically. Cruelly, he has been denied once more at the last."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
