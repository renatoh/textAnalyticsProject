The Italian saw the headline coming \u2013 as well as a barb from the man who will be in the opposite dugout at the King Power Stadium on Monday evening \u2013 when someone asked whether his signings were crucial to the club. \u201cYeah,\u201d said Ranieri, \u201cbut for me it is finished there, my job finished one year before they won the title.\u201d The reality is that his job effectively finished 12 months before that, when Trevor Birch, Chelsea\u2019s chief executive at the time, broke the news to Ranieri that a Russian by the name of Roman Abramovich was buying the club. \u201cI said: \u2018Me and you are the first who go home,\u2019\u201d Ranieri recalled. \u201cYou imagine, the new owner arrives and he wants to put in his own men. It is normal.\u201d Birch can still remember Ranieri performing a throat-cutting gesture at the time and it was only Abramovich\u2019s failure to land his No1 target that granted the Italian a stay of execution. \u201cIn July, Abramovich wanted to bring Sven-Goran Eriksson, who was the manager of the national team,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t possible for him and he said: \u2018OK, you start and we\u2019ll see what we can buy.\u2019\u201d What followed still leaves Birch astonished. \u201cWithin the space of six weeks we\u2019d spent nearly \u00a3140m on players, I literally had players in different rooms on the same day,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was almost, in a way, all your dreams come true. It was fantasy football in terms of how you can run a club, because you were given unlimited funds to go and sign whoever. This was a guy playing with monopoly money, so in terms of the players who were going to be available for Claudio, the sky was the limit.\u201d Ranieri and Abramovich actually had a reasonable relationship, even if the manager was portrayed as a dead man walking. In Ranieri\u2019s autobiography, Proud Man Walking, he describes the Russian as \u201ceverything a coach would want his chairman to be. Never interfering with selections, not expecting to win every single game, willing to buy more players than you could ask for, and always wearing a smile\u201d. Ranieri travelled on Abramovich\u2019s private jet and spent time on his yacht, yet admits that the latter experience was laced with guilt not pleasure. It was in Monte Carlo, only a couple of hours after Chelsea had lost 3-1 to Monaco in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final first leg, and Ranieri was too consumed by his tactical blunders to enjoy the spectacular hospitality Abramovich afforded the manager and players. He later admitted that he had seen winning in Monaco as a way of \u201cretaliating\u201d to the news that Peter Kenyon, who took over from Birch, was courting Mourinho, but ended up gambling everything \u2013 Ranieri threw on an extra striker after their opponents were reduced to 10 men \u2013 and losing the lot. The damage was terminal. Eleven years later and Ranieri, whose Leicester side are an incredible 17 points ahead of Chelsea in the table, remains very proud of his time at Stamford Bridge. He tells stories about the Chelsea supporters who thank him for what he started, and if there is any animosity towards Mourinho, who spoke so disparagingly of him when the two were managing in Italy, he does a good job of disguising it. There will be a fine bottle of Italian wine, Ranieri said, waiting for the Chelsea manager in his office after the match, and there is no doubt whatsoever in his mind that Abramovich will continue to back the Portuguese. \u201cHe knows Jos\u00e9 very well, and he knows only Jos\u00e9 in this moment can bring the team up. He has the quality.\u201d As for Ranieri, few people will begrudge his remarkable start to the season with Leicester. Birch, who is now firefighting at Bolton in his role as the insolvency practitioner advising the board, admits to taking great pleasure in seeing the man with whom he worked alongside at Stamford Bridge do so well. He describes Ranieri as a dream to work with and said Chelsea fans should be under no illusions about the hugely significant part their former manager played in helping to reshape the club\u2019s future. \u201cClaudio was so close that year, in 2004.\u201d Birch added. \u201cFinishing second to Arsenal\u2019s Invincibles was no mean achievement and in many ways it was a freak result against Monaco. And don\u2019t forget that the year that he took us to fourth place [in 2003], the only player that we signed was Enrique de Lucas on a free transfer. It was the fact that we beat Liverpool in that final game and got into the Champions League that was instrumental in attracting Abramovich. So Claudio played his part, if you like, in saving Chelsea.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
