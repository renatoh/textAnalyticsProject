Bezos, one of the world's richest men with a personal fortune of more than $20bn, has steered Amazon from its innocuous beginnings in 1994 as an online bookseller to a globally influential corporation with interests in media and publishing. Franzen, hailed by Time magazine as one of the great American novelists of his generation, became the first living novelist in a decade to grace its cover in 2010, for his novel Freedom. In an article for Guardian Review before the publication of his new book, The Kraus Project, he writes: \"In my own little corner of the world, which is to say American fiction, Jeff Bezos of Amazon may not be the antichrist, but he surely looks like one of the four horsemen. Amazon wants a world in which books are either self-published or published by Amazon itself, with readers dependent on Amazon reviews in choosing books, and with authors responsible for their own promotion.\" Franzen, whose stories about dysfunctional middle-class families hold up a mirror to contemporary America, has hit out at new media culture before, denigrating ebooks for their impermanence and branding Twitter the \"ultimate irresponsible medium\". This time he fingers Bezos specifically as the culprit, for steering his business in ways that Franzen believes undermine serious writers and do a disservice to readers. He writes: \"The work of yakkers and tweeters and braggers, and of people with the money to pay somebody to churn out hundreds of five-star reviews for them, will flourish in that world. But what happens to the people who became writers because yakking and tweeting and bragging felt to them like intolerably shallow forms of social engagement? What happens to the people who want to communicate in depth, individual to individual, in the quiet and permanence of the printed word, and who were shaped by their love of writers who wrote when publication still assured some kind of quality control and literary reputations were more than a matter of self-promotional decibel levels?\" Amazon's publishing activities, headquartered in New York, have expanded over the past three years through acquisitions of traditional publishing houses, the introduction of its Kindle Singles short-form digital series, and its online platform enabling writers to publish their own work in digital form. All of its book publishing activities have been wrapped around with online promotions, reader review content and constantly updating bestseller lists. \"As fewer and fewer readers are able to find their way, amid all the noise and disappointing books and phony reviews, to the work produced by the new generation of this kind of writer, Amazon is well on its way to making writers into the kind of prospectless workers whom its contractors employ in its warehouses, labouring harder for less and less, with no job security, because the warehouses are situated in places where they're the only business hiring,\" Franzen writes. The novelist has had his own troubles with the printed form. In 2010 the UK first printing of Freedom had to be pulped after a manuscript that did not contain the final edits was sent to the printer by mistake."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
