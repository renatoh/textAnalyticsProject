If City win against Rudi Garc\u00eda\u2019s side and better CSKA Moscow\u2019s result at Bayern Munich then next year\u2019s knockout phase will be reached. But they will be without Ag\u00fcero, who has scored 19 goals in 21 appearances, after the Argentinian suffered knee ligament damage in Saturday\u2019s win over Everton. Manuel Pellegrini said at Tuesday\u2019s pre-match press conference that Ag\u00fcero would be out for four to six weeks, although City\u2019s manager later voiced fears that the layoff could be as long as eight weeks. Dzeko is not 100% match-fit following a calf injury but should start and has a history of important strikes. When City claimed the title in 2011-12 he scored a 90th-minute equaliser in the final match against Queens Park Rangers before Ag\u00fcero\u2019s added-time winner. Last season Dzeko registered nine goals in City\u2019s last 11 matches to help push the team to the championship. Asked if he could again be the hero for Pellegrini\u2019s side against Roma, the Bosnian said: \u201cI\u2019m there when the team needs me and first of all I\u2019m happy to be back because I was never actually injured so long [a month] \u2013 it was a bit hard for me but now I\u2019m back and I\u2019ll do my best to try and score the goals and bring something good to the team. \u201cI did [score big goals] but that\u2019s past now and we have to look to the future, and like I said I always try to do my job and my job is to score goals and I will keep scoring them I\u2019m sure if I keep healthy.\u201d Dzeko\u2019s first appearance since 8 November was as a substitute on Saturday, after 63 minutes. \u201cI expected even less than 30 minutes; I was saying 15 minutes would be OK for me just to get back on the pitch and I already played 30. The feeling was OK but I still need some more games to come back,\u201d he said. On whether he can play all of the match against Rome, Dzeko said: \u201cAgainst Everton definitely not but Wednesday, who knows? We still have days [of] training so I will be better by Wednesday.\u201d Vincent Kompany, David Silva, Stevan Jovetic and Fernandinho, who had been doubtful, trained on Monday morning so they should be available to Pellegrini on Wednesday night. Dzeko believes the high-pressure stakes in Rome can bring the best out of City who defeated Bayern Munich in Group E\u2019s previous round which had also been a must-win game. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a special situation, in the league and Champions League because we were just trying to play but when we were eight points behind [Chelsea] we knew: \u2018OK, now we have to start playing.\u2019 And in the Champions League as well, we lost the game at home to CSKA and then you have to win the next game, and we won it, so maybe we need that pressure: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to explain. \u201cWe will definitely try to go there and score goals because if you don\u2019t score the goals you can\u2019t win the games. It will be a big game for them as well \u2013 I think the atmosphere will be amazing and that\u2019s what\u2019s football\u2019s about, and those kind of games we want to play. \u201cI played many games with the good atmosphere but actually I\u2019m looking forward to that game because they have great fans with a big stadium so it will hopefully be a night to remember. \u201cDefinitely confidence is high \u2013 we won five in a row. It\u2019s better confidence, better atmosphere in the team when you\u2019re winning the games and I think we\u2019re coming back to our normal performances especially after our national teams\u2019 break and hopefully we can be even better in the next week. There will be some big games, crucial games.\u201d Of Ag\u00fcero\u2019s injury, Dzeko said: \u201cThat was a big blow for us \u2013 you can see how he played recently for us. [But] I\u2019m back now, Alex [Kolarov] is back now, hopefully David will be back.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
