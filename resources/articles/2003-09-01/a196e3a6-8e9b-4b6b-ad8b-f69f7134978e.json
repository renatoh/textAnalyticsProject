The England captain says the team wilted physically and mentally in the 100F heat of Shizuoka after Rivaldo's equaliser at the end of the first half \"snatched away\" their momentum. \"We were knackered, we had nothing left,\" he said. \"If it had remained 1-0 at half-time I genuinely believe England might have won the World Cup,\" he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
