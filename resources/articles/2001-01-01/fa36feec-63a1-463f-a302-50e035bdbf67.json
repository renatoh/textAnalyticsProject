Only those who have waded through knee-deep lakes of earth, beer and unspeakable effluent in a vain search for the acoustic stage appreciate the spirit of wartime camaraderie that makes Glastonbury the most loved of all rock festivals. The many regulars, who buy tickets even before acts are announced, swap survival stories about rain, trauma-inducing toilets and the time a boy band himbo called Robbie Williams launched his solo career by invading Oasis's stage. It's the only festival in an overcrowded calendar to retain its flower-power values by giving most of the profits to charity. Glastonbury is certainly the only festival held on its promoters own land, and while it has succumbed to sponsorship (by the Guardian, among others), it still feels like a labour of love. It is not unheard of for revellers to have spiritual awakenings while getting down to Glasto favourite Rolf Harris. On a misty summer evening as music wafts from all the many stages, it's easy to believe the place is situated on ley lines, as hippies insist. Last year wasn't vintage in terms of bands - Radiohead and Madonna declined slots, and banal Travis and the Chemical Brothers didn't exactly up the star factor. Gangs of touts charged \u00a35 a head to let around 100,000 ticketless people in through gaps in the fence, as security guards looked on. At times the atmosphere seemed closer to a West Ham match than a festival, though football stadiums are usually free of crusties peddling hash brownies. It seems time for festival organiser Michael Eavis to rethink his strategy (suggestion: set rottweilers on the touts, and put the crusties on latrine duty - that'll show them). Nonetheless, the cancellation is a loss to fans and to the music business, whose participants need their annual orgy to clear their heads of idiots such as Westlife. But there's always 2002, and the oft-promised, still-unrealised lure of flushing toilets to bring the crowds back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
