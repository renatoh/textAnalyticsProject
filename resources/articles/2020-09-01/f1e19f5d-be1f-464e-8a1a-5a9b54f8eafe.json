This was a horse who had shown no real promise in seven previous hurdle races, yet he had been backed as if such an effort was expected, from an opening 20-1 down to 6-4. His performance was the more remarkable because he all but fell at the first flight, losing all momentum and quite a bit of ground, ballooned most of his hurdles thereafter and went widest of all. Yet, at one of the stiffest tracks in Ireland, those problems seemed to have taken no toll whatever as he cantered six lengths clear on the run-in. \u201cWe are chuffed,\u201d said his owner/trainer, Ronan McNally, to the Racing Post. But the mood had changed when McNally spoke to me on Sunday, by which time he says the handicapper had told him how much higher Dreal Deal will now be in the ratings. \u201cHe\u2019s going up by 19lb because of this whole storm on social media,\u201d McNally said. \u201cThat\u2019s nearly like the horse winning four races. \u201cWhat\u2019s the chance of him going and winning off 19lb higher now? His chances have vastly decreased. The media were saying: \u2018Oh, he\u2019s won with four stone in hand,\u2019 but they were just saying it flippantly. They were laughing. And then everyone on social media kicked off, big gamble this, big gamble that. \u201cIt\u2019s near impossible, 19lb, Jesus. There\u2019s \u00a36,000 made [in prize money] and now I\u2019m on a hiding to nothing. \u201cEveryone thinks you have this big gamble landed and you have all this money, that\u2019s totally inaccurate. I\u2019m very frustrated about the whole situation.\u201d McNally, who says there was sickness in his yard when Dreal Deal ran poorly in the past, backed him on Saturday but insists his winnings will hardly make a dent in the horse\u2019s \u00a350,000 purchase price. He is not, he adds, a big-time gambler and prize money is the income source on which he relies. \u201cI\u2019m no different to any man, if I think my horse is going to run well, I\u2019ll have a few quid on, that\u2019s what most people in racing do. But if I thought I could run my operation through gambling, I\u2019d be out of business in two days. You have to try and win prize money, jeepers creepers.\u201d The matter has been passed to Irish racing\u2019s referrals committee for further investigation, so we will see if that process brings any further light. Personally, I reckon Dreal Deal has got off pretty lightly with a 19lb rise. As the Post\u2019s analyst, David Jennings, noted: \u201cHe won with at least a stone in hand, possibly two, maybe even more.\u201d McNally\u2019s operation is a small one but it is only just over a year since his name came up in similar circumstances, when the well-backed The Jam Man won easily at Southwell, having been beaten 98 lengths on his previous start. The trainer also felt that was explicable, mentioning sickness in his stable as explaining the horse\u2019s previous form, and protested when the stewards interviewed him three times during the course of the day, saying it made him feel \u201clike a criminal\u201d, although no action was taken against him. The Jam Man won his next three races and ended the season on a rating more than two stones higher than the one he had at Southwell. Who would bet against Dreal Deal\u2019s career following a similar arc? For some committed fans, such events add to the gaiety of racing but I got off that bus a few stops back. Potential new enthusiasts are put off by outcomes that essentially pulp the form book. The cost of Dreal Deal\u2019s win is not only to the bookies. Monday\u2019s best bets Good luck to Warwick, where the small permitted crowd will see some interesting jump racing. I worry about the ground, after such a dry spell, but they\u2019ve apparently been chucking 50mm per week on it and have at least managed to get the GoingStick reading down below 8.0. The Bay Birch (2.45) is a ground-versatile sort, a winner at this track who has gone well fresh in the past, so she has plenty going for her in her handicap chase. Somehow, she starts this season half a stone below the mark from which she won at Chepstow last October. She\u2019s 4-1. At about the same odds, Red Nika (3.15) is intersting in the following handicap hurdle. Still only five, he showed plenty of promise as a novice last term, should have more to offer in this sphere and comes from the Tom Lacey yard that has won with four of it\u2019s last six runners. At Hamilton, Fanzone (3.25) is interesting at 9-1 as he returns to sprinting on his first start for a new yard. This might not be his day but I think there\u2019s ability in there and his rating looks beatable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
