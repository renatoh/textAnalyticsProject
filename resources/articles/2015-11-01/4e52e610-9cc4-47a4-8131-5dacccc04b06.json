Aly, one of the hosts on Channel 10\u2019s The Project, has become renowned for his editorials at the end of the show. On Monday\u2019s program he focused on the aftermath of the attacks in France that left 129 people dead. \u201cIsil\u2019s weak,\u201d Aly began, \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t look like that now, but it\u2019s the truth. And they don\u2019t want you to know it, which is why it\u2019s something we should talk about.\u201d The host outlined how Isis took credit for every attack, including those planned without any coordination from the group, such as the Sydney siege, \u201cso that they appear bigger and tougher than they actually are\u201d. \u201cBut Isil don\u2019t want you to know that. How do I know? Because Isil told us they don\u2019t want you to know that in their monthly magazine. \u201cIsil don\u2019t want you to know they would quickly be crushed if they ever faced a proper army on a real battlefield. They want you to fear them. \u201cIsil\u2019s strategy is to split the world into two camps, it\u2019s that black and white.\u201d He added: \u201cThey want countries like ours to reject their Muslims and vilify them,\u201d before cutting to a clip of Pauline Hanson speaking in an interview. The video ends with a riposte to MPs who are \u201cpreaching hate\u201d. \u201cI am angry at these terrorists. I\u2019m sickened by the violence and I\u2019m crushed for the families that have been left behind. But you know what, I won\u2019t be manipulated. We all need to come together. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what Isil doesn\u2019t want. So if you\u2019re a member of parliament, or a has-been member of parliament preaching hate at a time when what we actually need is more love, you\u2019re helping Isil. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that right now, none of us wants to help these bastards.\u201d The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, endorsed Aly\u2019s \u201cinsightful\u201d stance. But the Herald-Sun commentator Andrew Bolt savaged Aly\u2019s comments in his blog on Tuesday, saying Aly \u201ccould be seen to have an agenda\u201d because he was a Muslim and a former spokesman for the Islamic Council of Victoria when it \u201cvoted to make the extremist Sheik Hilali the mufti of Australia\u201d. Bolt said Channel 10 should consider whether Aly should be the station\u2019s \u201cmain explainer of Islamic terrorism\u201d. \u201cAnything that suggests that we can fight the Islamic State with a few hugs and hashtags, plus a big bucket of sand in which to bury our heads, is just what they want to hear,\u201d he wrote."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
