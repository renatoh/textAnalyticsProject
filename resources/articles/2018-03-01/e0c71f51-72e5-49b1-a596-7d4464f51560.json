United are still investigating claims of bullying and racism against Peter Beardsley, their under-23 manager, but have now told his principal accuser he can leave. The 22-year-old made two first-team appearances in cup games last season but failed to make an impact. In footballing terms his release comes as no surprise. Newcastle hope the Beardsley investigation will be concluded by May. The former England forward strongly denies the accusations. Beardsley has stayed away from St James\u2019 Park after being placed on gardening leave in January but spent the past week at St George\u2019s Park on a Football Association coaching course. A Londoner of Moroccan heritage, El-Mhanni played non-league football for Farnborough and Lewes before joining Newcastle in 2016. Meanwhile, Rafael Ben\u00edtez is confident his Newcastle players will remain \u201cunder control\u201d when he takes them to Spain for a four-day training camp on Thursday. The manager will head to a sports resort near Alicante with more than a degree of reluctance but, after Saturday\u2019s game at home to Southampton his team are without a match until Huddersfield\u2019s visit on Saturday 31 March. He is currently in the process of arranging a friendly fixture for next weekend, with Royal Antwerp and the Iceland national team among the potential opponents. \u201cI\u2019m not keen to go to Spain and I don\u2019t usually like to take everyone away from their families but, we\u2019re going because 21 days without a game is too long,\u201d said the former Liverpool manager Ben\u00edtez, who retains vivid memories of one particular such break during his Anfield tenure. Back in 2007 Liverpool prepared for a Champions League game at Barcelona at a hotel on Portugal\u2019s the Algarve. On the final night John Arne Riise\u2019s refusal to participate in curfew-breaking karaoke so enraged a drunk Craig Bellamy that the forward attacked him with a golf club. \u201cWe had a few problems in Portugal with Liverpool, although we then beat Barcelona,\u201d Ben\u00edtez said. \u201cNow, though, we have everything under control. There will be no parties. It\u2019s not too long \u2013 we will train, have a competitive game and then come back. The good thing is that the complex where we\u2019ll be isn\u2019t in the middle of town, so the players will have to stay there, relax and focus on football.\u201d Asked if his squad would be allowed a drink, Ben\u00edtez smiled. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can drink water, no problem.\u201d The manager is adamant there is no chance of a West Brom-like scenario, when four players, during a recent, disastrous, training break in Barcelona, allegedly stole a taxi in the early hours of the morning. One man unlikely to be in Alicante is Islam Slimani, the Algeria striker who is yet to make his Newcastle debut after arriving from Leicester in a \u00a32m January loan move. A thigh injury dictates he is touch and go for the Huddersfield game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
