Never mind the size of the fee that took him from Villarreal to Arsenal last month, the Brazilian centre-half has been held up as the solution to one of the London club\u2019s biggest problems \u2013 the lack of adequate defensive cover. There was general relief when he completed his \u00a311.3m transfer, not least from the existing central defenders, Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny. The former has shouldered the heaviest of workloads this season while the latter has had to manage the discomfort of a nagging achilles problem. Arsenal have been stretched too thinly at the back when injuries have bitten but Gabriel offers strength and reassurance. The 24-year-old is now set to make his debut in Sunday\u2019s FA Cup tie at the Emirates Stadium against Middlesbrough, the in-form Championship leaders and the conquerors of Manchester City in the last round. Aitor Karanka\u2019s team had previously been close to the scalp of Liverpool in the Capital One Cup only to lose an epic penalty shootout 14-13 last September. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said that he wanted to rest Mertesacker but he added that Koscielny had a slight shoulder problem, which would need a late test. Either way, Gabriel should start and even Wenger admitted that the sense of anticipation was underpinned by tension. \u201cThe players are always under tremendous pressure because everything they do is analysed by the pundits and the press,\u201d the Arsenal manager said. \u201cThey know that, and the modern player has to live with that. Resistance to stress has to be stronger than it was 10 years ago. But at least he will not read the press.\u201d The last comment was delivered with a smile, and it referred to Gabriel\u2019s lack of English. He has only the basics in Spanish, according to Wenger, having been at Villarreal for just 18 months and hardly anybody at Arsenal speaks Portuguese. Gabriel\u2019s linguistic shortcomings are part blessing, part curse. \u201cWhen I was in Japan [as manager of Nagoya Grampus Eight], people could say what they wanted,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cI learned to speak Japanese in the end but the difference is that you can speak it and still not read the alphabet. \u201cThe kanji has 2,000 different characters and the children at school have writing lessons every day until they are 14. And even then, they cannot read the newspaper \u2013 it takes so much time. In Japan, I only read the Japan Times \u2013 because it was in English. Gabriel will just focus on his game. That is one of the advantages.\u201d The disadvantages are the scope for costly communication breakdowns. \u201cLook, it is a problem,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t speak English and you don\u2019t understand: \u2018Come out, come back, right, left,\u2019 it is a problem for a defender. You need to know the key words: \u2018Referee. Offside. Foul\u2019. \u201cHe\u2019s the first defender I\u2019ve brought in with no English. In terms of other players, Jos\u00e9 Reyes was not fantastic with his English, even when he left. But Thierry Henry arrived here and three months later, he was fluent in English. Some learn quickly. For some people, it takes longer. Gabriel is very focused. We\u2019ll see.\u201d Wenger will make changes to his lineup for the visit of Middlesbrough, who have lost only once since 21 October, with the one swap he confirmed being Wojciech Szczesny for David Ospina in goal. But Wenger remains determined to mount a successful defence of the trophy that he and his team won last May. \u201cWe have always taken the Cup seriously,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cWe have won it five times during my period here \u2013 nobody has won it more in the last 18 years. Our basic [aim for the season] is always to finish in the top four and then win a trophy on top of that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
