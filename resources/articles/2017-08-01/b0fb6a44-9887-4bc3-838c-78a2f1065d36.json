At the risk of being accused of sniping, wouldn\u2019t this have been a better idea before he published his photography book, What I See? Of course, it was amusing when Brooklyn published his book of snaps (sorry, I mean, in-depth career retrospective) at the age of 18. However, while the book was too early, Brooklyn couldn\u2019t be blamed. He\u2019s just an excited kid, who had doubtless been complimented into doing it (\u201cWow, that out-of-focus shot is amazing!\u201d). Sorry, but I blame the parents. The Beckhams have as much right as anyone to love and encourage their children, but they are in a very rare and strange situation \u2013 where perhaps it\u2019s not so much about teaching your kids to grab opportunities as it is about teaching them not to always grab them. To give a couple of examples: film director Duncan Jones (David Bowie\u2019s son) was in his late 30s when he made Moon. And, while Stella McCartney was slated for using Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell as models in her college fashion show, at least she went to college; she also stuck to refusing to use leather and fur, when, with fashion industry zillions at stake, the useful McCartney surname only goes so far. Maybe the greatest lesson that celebrities such as the Beckhams could teach their kids would be knowing when to say: \u201cNo thank you, I\u2019m not ready yet.\u201d As it is, arguably Brooklyn has been cheated of having a \u201creal\u201d debut photography book, one published after studying and working at his craft, one that may not have been ridiculed. Ultimately, for someone such as Brooklyn, no amount of cash or attention is going to matter more than knowing that they truly earned it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
