According to the Arsenal manager, anyone who falls below expected standards has to accept they are in the firing line. \u201cThis is normal,\u201d Emery said. \u201cI was not surprised because this team has big players and can think about winning the Premier League. They lost a lot of points.\u201d At the sharp end of management there was not much room for sympathy. Arsenal face a United side who have won seven games in succession since Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r replaced Mourinho. United have made up a lot of ground in the Premier League and the two clubs are now locked on 44 points, with Arsenal narrowly ahead on goal difference in the outsiders\u2019 chase for a top-four finish. Emery is wary of how a revitalised United pose a big threat in the FA Cup tie at the Emirates. \u201cThey are very dangerous and in a good moment,\u201d he said. \u201cI am going to find the best first XI, because against Manchester United, we will need the best performance and quality.\u201d There will be at least one forced change with H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn joining the long-term injury list after suffering a cruciate injury against Chelsea last weekend. Petr Cech will be hoping for a return to the team in goal. The Mesut \u00d6zil question rumbles on. The potential for a rendezvous with Alexis S\u00e1nchez adds spice. The striker has been backed by Solskj\u00e6r to respond in a positive way if given a feisty welcome on his first return to the Emirates since leaving Arsenal for United last January. Despite a largely underwhelming year at Old Trafford, Emery is an admirer of S\u00e1nchez, having attempted to sign him while in charge of Paris Saint-Germain. \u201cHe is a very good player and when I was at PSG, we thought he could help us,\u201d Emery said. \u201cWe spoke about a lot of players, about a lot of important players, and one was the possibility of Alexis. But it was not possible because of circumstances at the time.\u201d Even if the home crowd will not be too pleased to clap eyes on S\u00e1nchez, Emery is thinking only about how to quell the varied attacking threats United carry. \u201cI respect him. In my preparations, every player is playing against the best player from Manchester United and one is Alexis S\u00e1nchez.\u201d The player who was prolific at Arsenal has scored only once this season. United have looked liberated under Solskj\u00e6r, with Marcus Rashford in confident form leading the lineand Paul Pogba eager to prompt the attack whenever he can. Emery is hoping Arsenal can show a bit more of the resilience that helped them earn a first clean sheet against a high calibre opponent when they kept Chelsea at a relatively safe distance. The team\u2019s work rate, and greater evidence of pressing led from the front by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette, looked more in keeping with the style Emery is trying to instil."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
