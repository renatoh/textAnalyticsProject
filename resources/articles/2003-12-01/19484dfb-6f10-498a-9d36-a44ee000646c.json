'It's amazing to be home for Christmas,' Mr Henderson told a press conference upon his arrival. The 32-year-old backpacker flew in from Colombia, where he and four fellow hostages from Israel were released two days ago after spending 102 days held captive in remote mountain jungles. Mr Henderson had an emotional reunion with his parents at Heathrow airport before facing the press. 'It does feel amazing to be out, amazing to be free,' he said. Despite his ordeal, Mr Henderson was said to be in good health, although tired and having trouble adjusting to his new-found freedom. 'It still feels like it's September to us,' he said. He has lost two stone after surviving on rations and marching hundreds of miles through sweltering jungle with his captors, the National Liberation Army (ELN), the smaller of Colombia's two Marxist guerrilla groups. Mr Henderson, a television producer living in Clapham, London, thanked the Roman Catholic church, and the Colombian and British governments for their help in securing his release, but he declined to answer further questions. His father also thanked the media. Now he will spend Christmas at home in North Yorkshire surrounded by friends and family. His father Christopher, 59, a retired RAF wing commander, and mother Sharelle, 57, described their son's homecoming as the greatest Christmas present ever. They were called by the Foreign Office on Monday with the news that he was free. Mr Henderson, fellow Briton Matthew Scott, 19, a German, a Spaniard and the four Israelis were kidnapped on September 12. They were part of a larger group of 15 tourists who were travelling to the 2,500-year-old ruins of the Ciudad Perdida, or Lost City. Mr Scott, also from Clapham, made a daring escape bid 11 days later and was picked up by the Colombian army after surviving alone for another 12 days in the jungle. The German and Spanish captives, Reinhilt Weige and Asier Echeverria, were released around three weeks ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
