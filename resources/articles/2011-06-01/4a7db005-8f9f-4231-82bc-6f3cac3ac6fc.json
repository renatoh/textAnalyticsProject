The panel, set up after the sacking of John Steele as chief executive, also includes former England captain Bill Beaumont, fellow board member John Spencer and Rob Andrew, the former elite director, who was advised not to apply for the performance post. It will decide a fourth drafting of the job description, which former England head coach Woodward announced last month he would no longer be considering. Steele's short tenure at the helm of the RFU came to an early end after he changed the performance director's remit by removing any control over Martin Johnson's England side \u2013 a position now to be looked at by the committee of five. \"They will review the role and report back to the board at the end of the month,\" said Martyn Thomas, the RFU chairman. \"In my view, there is no point in having someone who is responsible for developing talent, but whose interest ends with the second team. We are a major rugby nation and should be in the top three of the world rankings, not sixth, a place we have not been since Clive was coach. \"I have a lot of respect for Clive and I was not happy with the way he was treated. He has ruled himself out of the job and will be focusing on the Olympics [as elite performance director]. I cannot envisage us doing nothing until then. We cannot hang around and we will be appointing a firm of recruitment consultants to help us. You can have the best structure in the world, but what is critical is the appointments you make.\" Steele maintained he was carrying out a decision made by the RFU board, whereas Thomas said they had merely voted at a meeting in April to remove the England element until after the World Cup this autumn. Thomas told the RFU's council on Friday that such was the ambiguity surrounding what the board had agreed that he and Steele could both claim to be right. The downgrading of the job was seen as the key reason why Woodward showed no formal interest in the post. Steele had already incurred the wrath of Thomas by postponing an interview arranged with Woodward in early March. England's World Cup-winning coach was, at that stage, the only candidate on the shortlist. Steele sent Thomas and Beaumont, the other member of the appointment panel, an email saying he had delayed the interview, but they learned of the development from Woodward himself. Thomas said he could not understand why Steele had changed his mind about the performance director's tasks. Steele's problem was that it became seen as a search for an England supremo, with Woodward the obvious candidate. He protested that the process would be open and transparent, but found himself presiding over a foregone conclusion. The irony is that when Woodward was the England head coach and found himself saddled with a performance director, Chris Spice, he insisted on continuing to report directly to the chief executive, Francis Baron. There is a feeling the most suitable job for Woodward would be as Steele's successor given that, if he were to become performance director, any chief executive would struggle to get the board on his side should he get into a conflict with Woodward. \"Clive did not apply for the job last time and I cannot see him stuck behind a desk, but you would have to ask him,\" said Thomas. \"I suspect he still sees himself as a man with an outstanding talent for developing exceptional athletes. The fact that Clive withdrew from the process had nothing to do with John leaving the RFU. There was an issue of confidence in the way a critical role had been handled in relation to interviews and candidates.\" Thomas, who will be acting chief executive until Steele's replacement is found, saw off a bid to place a vote of no confidence in him, but the cost was a review of the performance director's role and an inquiry into Steele's departure.
