However, maybe Mozy should forget about storage and go into the T-shirt business. As iJustine says: Everyone was asking me where I got the \"Back the F:\\ up\" T-shirt -- That was their brilliant creation. Seriously, this is the best internet company T-shirt I've ever got! It looks like the best internet company T-shirt I have not got, but I'd buy one, given the chance, even though I've never even heard of Fear Factory. (And, no, I don't want a knock-off: it has to be the real thing.) Sadly, Mozy isn't selling T-shirts. It's much smarter than that. At http://backthefup.net/, it says: You want a \"Back The F:\\ Up\" t shirt, and we want to give you one. But you're gonna have to work for it. So here's how it works. We're not selling them. Instead, we want you to tell us what you're going to do to get one. We're open to pretty much anything, as long as it's awesome, gives Mozy some props, and doesn't suck. Basically you have to suggest a promotional idea. Then, if Mozy agrees, you have to execute your idea. If all goes well, you can then \"Wear your exclusive 'Back The F:\\ Up' T-shirt with pride, knowing that you are FREAKING AWESOME.\" So all you have to do is come up with two brilliant ideas and send me your spare T-shirt ;-) Trivia note: It's T-shirt not t-shirt. It's a shirt that's shaped like a T, and it is not shaped like a t. Using lower case is wrong, and just as wrong as if you wrote about a t-junction or an a-line dress. Although The Guardian has a bit of a fetish that can lead to the inappropriate use of lower-case characters, we generally get this one right. Please, Mozy, copy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
