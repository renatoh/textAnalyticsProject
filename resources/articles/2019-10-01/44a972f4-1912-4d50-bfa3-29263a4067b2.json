Give us a break", "bodyText": "You may like Snackmasters (Channel 4) if you\u2019re a fan of BBC Two\u2019s Inside the Factory, which reveals how popular foodstuffs are made by visiting the production line; or the YouTube series Gourmet Makes, in which a chef reverse engineers a homemade version of a mass-produced snack. Here, visits to the production line of a popular snack are interspersed with \u2013 a crucial difference, your honour \u2013 two chefs competing to make a superior reverse-engineered version. Week one: KitKats. Daniel Clifford, the head chef at Midsummer House in Cambridge, and Vivek Singh, the boss of the Cinnamon Club in London, have three weeks to perfect a convincing four-finger facsimile. Your host is Fred Sirieix, the maitre d\u2019 whose presence, urbanely silver-bearded and twinkly of eye, is such a comfort on First Dates. He is a minor national treasure, and it would be churlish to criticise him. Except, he\u2019s the presenter of Snackmasters, and criticising is what I\u2019m paid for. So: what exactly does he do to warrant cult-hero status? Telling nervy singletons they look nice in that dress is all very charming, but he is doing the hard prime-time yards now, leading from the front, burdened with making a derivative factertainment format work. Gallic suaveness alone isn\u2019t going to snap any wafers. Our Fred\u2019s main problem is the one at the heart of any contrived reality contest, which is whether anyone at home could give a fig about the outcome. Take it seriously and you risk looking foolish; not seriously enough and you admit the whole escapade is a waste of time. Sirieix tries to square that circle by going for macho hype so enthusiastic that you hope it is flavoured with irony. \u201cThese two are so competitive! This is the contest of a lifetime for them!\u201d he says of Clifford and Singh. \u201cNever mind your past accolades, your Michelin stars. This is the defining moment of your career.\u201d Surely he\u2019s taking the mickey? But almost all of Sirieix\u2019s interventions are along the same lines, so it is hard to tell. Definitely having a laugh, or trying to, is Jayde Adams, who is inside the KitKat factory in York. Adams is a comedian rather than a presenter, so it\u2019s up to her to extract the funny from industrialised confectionery. Perhaps she will warm up as the series goes on \u2013 it\u2019s pickled-onion Monster Munch next week \u2013 but for now she is sticking with gags your dad would do. Thousands of KitKats whiz past on a conveyor belt. Adams grabs one. \u201cThat one\u2019s broken. I\u2019ll have that!\u201d So there\u2019s plenty riding on the contestants and, luckily, they come through. Clifford goes for it, spending \u00a31,700 on a bespoke chocolate mould, striving to get precisely the right pattern on his wafer by customising a waffle iron with an angle-grinder and saying things such as: \u201cI haven\u2019t come here to come second.\u201d Singh casually tosses sugar and eggs around in a pan. Clifford puts a KitKat in a centrifuge to distinguish its constituent parts; Singh experiments with using slightly more milk powder. Clifford combines four types of chocolate to try to ape the \u201cunique\u201d KitKat exterior; Singh makes some chocolate. Oddly, neither chef thinks to scrape the coating off some KitKats and remould it, although Clifford does gain an advantage by knowing that the light-brown sticky stuff inside a KitKat is made from \u2026 pureed KitKats. This philosophically challenging trade secret \u2013 only previously known to the 2 million people who saw it on a 2015 episode of Inside the Factory \u2013 is the highlight of Adams\u2019s tour of KitKat HQ. She doesn\u2019t do a joke about it, though (not even the easy one about how they made the first KitKat). At last, we reach the judging, conducted by a panel of five Nestl\u00e9 high-ups who include, says Sirieix, \u201chard-to-please factory production manager John\u201d and \u201cruthless improvement specialist Chiara\u201d. (He\u2019s certainly having a giggle. Isn\u2019t he?) Clifford\u2019s fake KitKat tastes like the real thing, but that counts for little because he suffers an embarrassment to rival a collapsed showstopper in Bake Off: his KitKat doesn\u2019t break, it bends. He moistened his wafer at the last minute and ended up with spongy goo. Singh\u2019s KitKat hasn\u2019t got the right taste, but it\u2019s brittle so it doesn\u2019t spoil the immortal \u201cHave a break, have a KitKat\u201d tagline. He wins by three votes to two. \u201cIt\u2019s a wafer-thin result!\u201d quips Sirieix nonsensically, before urging Singh to \u201chave a break\u201d. Having smoothly done the bare minimum, Sirieix melts away, leaving Clifford to sign off by ruing the fact that his wafer was a travesty. \u201cAdding water to it! What a dick.\u201d Don\u2019t worry, mate. It really doesn\u2019t matter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
