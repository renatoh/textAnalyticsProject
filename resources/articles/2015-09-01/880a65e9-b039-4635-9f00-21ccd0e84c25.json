The neo-fascist group came in third with 7% of the vote, behind the triumphant leftwing Syriza and conservative New Democracy. The result was met with abhorrence and dismay. In April most of its leaders were put on trial on charges of running a criminal organisation masquerading as a political force. The party \u2013 which has denied the charges \u2013 stands accused of murder, armed attacks, money laundering and trafficking. \u201cGolden Dawn is a movement of power, it is not a protest movement any more,\u201d the party\u2019s Swastika- tattooed spokesman, Ilias Kasidiaris, told Star TV as it became clear that the extremists had retained their position as the country\u2019s third biggest political force. \u201cGolden Dawn is the only party seeing an increase in its percentage. In October when Greeks begin to experience the consequences of the memorandum and illegal immigration you will see our support increase radically,\u201d said the former marine, berating the country\u2019s mainstream media for boycotting the party. With 18 MPs in the 300-seat house, around 500,000 Greeks cast ballots in favour of Golden Dawn. The organisation performed especially well in Attica, the greater Athens region and the Aegean islands of Lesbos and Kos where voter support doubled. Both islands have been overwhelmed in recent months by thousands of refugees and migrants fleeing conflict and poverty. Golden Dawn\u2019s anti-immigrant stance at a time of mounting fears over Greece\u2019s frontline role in Europe\u2019s biggest humanitarian crisis in recent history, almost certainly helped. The party, portraying itself as the \u201conly nationalist choice\u201d played heavily on fears that Greeks could soon become a minority in their own country. But, so too, did its shrill opposition to the internationally sponsored bailout accords, or memoranda, that the extremists have said amount to \u201cethnocide\u201d or death of the nation. Polls showed that 16.6% of those who voted for Golden Dawn were victims of record levels of unemployment \u2013 the most grievous side-effect of massive budget cuts and lay-offs enforced as the price of being bailed out to the tune of \u20ac326bn by creditors from the EU and International Monetary Fund (IMF). \u201cIn terms of absolute numbers Golden Dawn was the only party to hold its ground,\u201d said Aristides Hatzis, political commentator and Athens University professor. \u201cIt was not at all affected by the very high rate of [electoral] abstention. Its performance is a danger and disgrace for our democracy.\u201d The party won 6.8% of the vote in the election in January despite most of its leadership being behind bars. MPs, including Nikos Michaloliakos, the group\u2019s founder, and Kasidiaris, his anointed dauphin, were released this year after serving the pre-trial maximum of 18 months in prison. Analysts had predicted a dip in Golden Dawn\u2019s popularity after Michaloliakos admitted to \u201cpolitical responsibility\u201d for the brutal murder of an anti-fascist Greek rap singer in September 2013. The diminutive leader, an admirer of Hitler, has denied neo-Nazi links, but fascist paraphernalia were discovered in his Athens home upon his arrest. Golden Dawn\u2019s emblem resembles a swastika. With the ultra-nationalists using the refugee crisis and economic despair of Greeks to gain ground, political scientists said Sunday\u2019s election was further proof that the Golden Dawn phenomenon had assumed particularly worrying dimensions. All agreed that the virulent anti-immigrant, antisemitic, anti-EU party had spread its tentacles deep into Greek society. \u201cIt tells us that Golden Dawn is not just a symptom of the crisis but is here to stay,\u201d said Dimitris Keridis, professor of international political science at Athens\u2019 Panteion University. \u201cAnd it shows that the Greek disease is not superficial, it\u2019s much deeper than many think.\u201d Before the outbreak of Greece\u2019s great debt crisis, the far-rightists were a fringe party on the political scene gaining less than 0.5% of the vote."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
