Clare Gibson, head of services at the Edinburgh charity Streetwork said the severe weather made survival exceptionally difficult for rough sleepers. As sub-zero temperatures have bitten over the past few days, organisations such as Streetwork have acted, even when other infrastructure have effectively ground to a halt, to try to ensure that the conditions do not prove fatal to those who have nowhere else to turn at Christmas. Gibson said rough sleepers were at risk from violence, drugs and prostitution throughout the year and the severe cold weather presented yet another challenge. \"It's the festive period and everyone's excited about Christmas; for our users they just need to survive on the streets,\" she said. \"We want to be there to give them support \u2013 the snow just makes it more difficult.\" When temperatures fall below zero a severe weather emergency protocol kicks in to ensure everyone is given a roof over their head for the night and stop people dying on the streets. This year the protocol came into effect last month, earlier than usual, and has been called down on more nights than anyone can remember, according to outreach workers. In Aberdeen, where temperatures have dropped as low as -19C (-2F), homelessness charities have been stretched to the limit. Scott Baxter, deputy chief executive of Aberdeen Cyrenians, said organisations had pulled together to meet the needs of rough sleepers and been helped by generous donations from the public. \"A lot of people have been coming to us with the effects of the cold, looking for basic shelter and warmth, clothes washed, showers, more so than we've experienced in recent years and earlier,\" he said. \"It has been stretched but we believe we have helped every one that's come in through our doors.\" In London, St Mungo's believes it has given a bed to everyone who has needed it during the freeze, even if it is a mattress on the floor. Luton Sinfield, St Mungo's outreach and community services manager, said a more co-ordinated regional response to the problem was needed, particularly in London which has 33 councils. \"We think it's really important the mayor, central government, other organisations have a response to back up the local response,\" he said. Without a co-ordinated response, a homeless person who shows up in an area without an ongoing problem of rough sleeping could find little available to them. Statistics published by Broadway Homelessness and Support suggest the number of rough sleepers in the capital is going up, with 2,468 sleeping rough between July and September this year, compared with 2,221 in the same period last year. St Mungo's, like the other homelessness charities, wants the public emphasis to be on tackling rough sleeping 365 days a year, not just at Christmas, and on getting people out of emergency accommodation and into stable housing. Sinfield expressed hope that the cold weather could be the impetus some people needed to get off them off the streets permanently. The cold was a matter of life and death, he said, \"but in a perverse way it can also be that change lever, for people to think 'my life can be different'\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
