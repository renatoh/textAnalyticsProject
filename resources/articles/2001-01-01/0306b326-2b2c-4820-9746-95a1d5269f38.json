Safely tucked over the river on the Wirral, they struggle away in lower divisions, posing no real threat. And then this happened. First Division Tranmere claimed the most prized of their six Premiership cup scalps of the past two seasons to win this Fourth Round FA Cup tie in style. They had never scored in their three other games against Everton, and had waited 32 years for this chance of an upset. But it was no fluke that they left Everton with only a relegation battle ahead of them. Both sides got what they deserved and after a colourful carnival at kick-off, there were more blue seats than blue faces on show by the end. First-half goals from Steve Yates and Jason Koumas were no more than Tranmere merited; in fact they could have led by more at the break. They then kept their collective cool when Everton came out spitting bullets at the start of the second half. It transpired they were firing blanks as Yates finished them off with Rovers' third with just under half an hour to go. To say that Everton's manager, Walter Smith, was disappointed would be to accurately report the most oft-used word in his brief post-match press conference. But what else could he say, in public, about his team? Everton fans will hope there were stronger sentiments rattling around some heads in the home dressing room. Tranmere's manager, John Aldridge, walks on water, according to one of the old school FA Cup banners on display among the magnificent Tranmere supporters, so expressing his joy at beating the club he used to score against so regularly for Liverpool came naturally. Aldridge has admitted he has come close to walking out on Rovers on more than one occasion, but he said that this day belonged to his players. 'That ranks up there with some of the great games I've had and it came against an Everton side with an abundance of quality,' he said. 'I would love Liverpool in the next round, but that [his time at Anfield] is all in the past. Believe it or not, I like Everton to do well, I've got a lot of friends here. I'm from Liverpool, I like Liverpool, Everton and Tranmere. The City is important to me.' Aldridge also admitted the vital importance of the timing of Tranmere's first goal because Everton had, as expected, started the stronger side and had a couple of half-chances to take the lead. But the balance of power shifted from the 22nd minute. Sean Flynn crossed to the far post from the right and Yates looped a header back into the opposite corner of the net as Thomas Myhre watched in horror; he seemed to think the ball was going over. The Norwegian keeper was playing on loan for Tranmere at the beginning of the month, but he appeared totally bemused by his recent team-mates. He still did not appear to know his post from his elbow when Koumas scored 13 minutes later. Andy Parkinson set him up after making a strong run into the penalty area and Koumas scored with a classy chip from just outside the box as Myrhe again looked on in awe. Tranmere twice went close to increasing their advantage before the break. Clint Hill shot narrowly wide from 20 yards and only a last-gasp tackle by Michael Ball denied Parkinson . Everton massively upped their tempo at the start of the second half. They were flying, though mainly into stroppy challenges and over imaginary fouls in the Tranmere penalty area. Determined, but desperate. Tranmere seemed set to just defend their lead, but went one better by killing Everton's spirit with the third goal when Yates headed in at the near post from a 62nd-minute Koumas corner. Not bad for a central defender playing at left wingback. Not bad for a side one place above the bottom of the first division."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
