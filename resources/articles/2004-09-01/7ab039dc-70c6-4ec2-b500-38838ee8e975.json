Hal Sutton has adopted an interesting strategy for his line-up, putting his players in the order they qualified then throwing in his two wild card picks at the bottom. Hardly rocket science then. Bern-Hard Langer has mixed his experienced players with his rookies throughout the line-up, so there are some fascinating match-ups. The action begins in a quarter of an hour with Tiger Woods taking on Paul Casey in one of the games of the day. Casey, ranked 27 in the world, will certainly not be overawed by the prospect, but Sutton will be hoping to reduce the deficit early on with his star player. With Phil Mickelson and Sergio Garcia facing off next, it promises to be some day. Europe need just three points to retain the cup, and three and a half to win it outright. The US overcame a 10-6 Saturday night scoreline to win in Brookline in 1999, but whether this American team has the same determination and ability remains to be seen. I've got my chicken and stuffing baguette with me for my tea, so I'm ready. I hope you all are too. Singles line-ups: Paul Casey v Tiger Woods Sergio Garcia v Phil Mickelson Darren Clarke v Davis Love David Howell v Jim Furyk Lee Westwood v Kenny Perry Colin Montgomerie v David Toms Luke Donald v Chad Campbell Miguel Angel Jimenez v Chris DiMarco Thomas Levet v Fred Funk Ian Poulter v Chris Riley Padraig Harrington v Jay Haas Paul McGinley v Stewart Cink 5.02pm: Two shots gone, advantage to Europe. Tiger Woods drilled his tee-shot into the deep rough - well, as deep as it gets in Detroit. To rub salt into the wounds, Casey whacked his into A1 position. It really would deflate the American optimism if the Englishman could win this first hole. 5.10pm: Woods plays a good recovery shot to land next to Casey on the green. Casey putts first, leaving himself a tricky four-footer for par. Woods' putt is good enough for a gimme. The cheers on the first hole are now not for Woods, but for his team-mate (team associate might be a more fitting word) Phil Mickelson. Big Phil is far more popular with the locals than the aloof Woods. 5.15pm: Casey displays a sign of nerves and misses his putt to halve the hole, putting Woods one up. Casey still doesn't look too flustered though amid the neanderthal cries of \"U S A\". Garcia, meanwhile, smashes his drive just off the fairway from the first tee, and Mickelson sends his flying wildly right of the intended target. So to Rob Hisnay, who, as the first person to email me on this momentous day, deserves to be heard: \"Are Kraftwerk in Detroit to play 'Europe Endless' for Hal Sutton?\" There's no evidence to the contrary, so let's say yes. 5.22pm: Both Casey and his illustrious opponent Woods are making a meal of the par-five second hole. Casey's drive ended in a fairway bunker, from which he could only chip out twenty yards. Woods, in the rough after his drive, also fluffed his second and his ball is waiting for him in the sand. Mickelson and Garcia are also making the amateur players in the crowd feel better about themselves by making a right pig's ear of the opening hole. Mickelson has just played his fourth shot to around six feet from the cup, so a bogey is not even guaranteed. Garcia is in a bunker after two shots, so if he can get down in a further two from there, the hole is the Spaniard's. So to Darren Clarke and Davis Love on the first tee. The Ulsterman hit such a cracker that even some of the Americans ventured to applaud it. Don't hand Clarke a cigar just yet though, as Love is also in a pretty good position. A fan's cry of \"Get in the hole\" immediately after Love's driver had made contact with the ball was somewhat premature. Not to mention idiotic. 5.28pm: Sergio missed his putt for a par, and Mickelson just about read the contours of the green correctly for a bogey, so the pair move on to the second tee all square. Woods, meanwhile, could only manage a par at the second, so Casey has a chance to halve the hole if he can make his eight foot putt for a five. 5.29pm: Casey rattles it into the hole, so he remains only one down. Hopefully that will settle him. I must say I fancy him to avoid defeat in this match, though they could be famous last words. Apologies if they are. 5.32pm: Jim Furyk and David Howell are next up for the ordeal of the first tee, but before that they must have the obligatory photograph. After an hour on the driving range, not to mention several hours of unrelenting nerves, you finally arrive at the first tee just wanting to hurry on with things, and some official demands a flaming photograph. Let's hope Big Phil's was a good'un, as he's having a torrid time on the course. Now he has found a bunker from the tee at the second hole. 5.36pm: Both Woods and Casey missed the green with their tee shots on the par-three third, and Casey has overplayed his second from the rough. Darren Clarke and Davis Love have halved the first hole in pars. This could be the highest quality match of them all. 5.39pm: Woods has missed a putt for par to take the third hole, with Casey nailing another tester from about eight feet. Mickelson has shown his exceptional array of shots, recovering from his dreadful drive to achieve a birdie at the second. Garcia halved the hole with a solid chip and putt. Mark Curry asks: \"Is there any truth to the rumours that a number of 'Euro' players (as the US press likes to coin a name of the opponents) past and present are keen to invite the USGA to solicit a Nafta ruling and hence invite Mexican and Canadian players in to help bolster the depth of team USA for future cups? The embarrassment of having to thump the Ameros like this every two years might well be a factor.\" Well, it certainly has been rumoured, but whether there is any truth to it, I'm not so sure. We could even go back to the match being America against Britain and Ireland. After all, only three of this year's European team are from the continent. That would be equally humiliating for \"U S A\". 5.47pm: Tiger has played a fine approach to the fourth green, which has brough a new exclamation from the rednecks in the crowd: \"Come on bayby, yee-hah, come on bayby.\" Oh my word. 5.49pm: Sergio has bogeyed the third hole, gifting Big Phil the lead. Love has also moved ahead against Clarke with a birdie at the second. There's only red on the board at the moment, as Furyk is also beating Howell. Never fear, though, our saviour Colin Montgomerie will be on the course shortly. 5.51pm: Casey's determination has just increased ten-fold. As he prepared for his third shot, someone who should be ejected from the grounds shouted out, causing the debutant to demand he be silent. Casey proceeded to make an excellent up and down, so is still just one behind. He's yet to find his rhythm, but he is not relinquishing his loose grip on the Tiger's tail. 5.56pm: Kenny Perry and Lee Westwood are all square through one after both players had birdie putts which pretended they were going to enter the cup, only to tease their masters and choose to stay just by the hole. The cheeky beggars. 5.59pm: Casey really is having a rough ride with his audience. After his approach landed in a perilous position, the crowds erupted as if they had just won the whole blimming competition. What other nation would celebrate the sporting hardship of an opponent? What's that? Middle class Britain when Tim Henman plays anyone at Wimbledon? Oh. 6.02pm: Europe has won its first hole of the day. Darren Clarke shook off the nerves to knock his putt right into the middle of the hole at the third. David Howell, on the other hand, has made a disappointing start, and is two down to Jim Furyk. Aha, here he comes. Big Monty steps up to the tee with a face of fierce Scottish determination, and whallops his drive straight down the fairway. The European team needs such inspiration right now. 6.05pm: Casey continues to struggle - he has now bogeyed three of the first five holes. Woods has been barely more consistent, but a confident five-foot putt for five hands the world No2 a two-hole lead. 6.08pm: Colin Montgomerie, what a hero you are. With a huge Saltire waving in the crowd, Monty stepped up to the plate and sent his ball on the way to a fine birdie at the first. David Toms might have a tough day ahead of him. Andy Kocen says: \"Could you send a big plea to whoever runs the power networks in London NW3 to get a move on and restore my electricity. Not that I'm unhappy watching your web updates and would rather watch it on TV - it's that my laptop battery will run out in only an hour's time. In the meantime, I'd like to suggest that the Euros start chanting 'EU, EU' when things go well as part of some kind of counter-idiocy and a taste of their own medicine.\" A good idea, Andy. How about, \"We're on the march with Monty's army etc.\" as well? 6.12pm: Woods has more or less driven the sixth green, which stands 320 yards from the tee. I can barely see that far let alone hit a golf ball that far. Now then, Sergio has a putt to regain all-square status with Phil Mickelson after Big Phil sent his birdie putt on one of those long trips around the green before finally descending the slope towards the hole. After a few hundred grips and re-grips, Sergio finally takes his club back, but the ball at no stage looks on the correct line. 6.15pm: In response to Tiger's awesome drive, Casey plays a phenomenal bunker shot to within inches of the hole. He's covered in sand from head to toe, but it was worth it. The shot hardly raises a flicker from the partisan fans. Lee Westwood has raced ahead of Kenny Perry in the fifth match. He is now, erm, one up after two. Unfortunately, I nipped downstairs to buy a Mars bar, so I'm afraid I can't tell you how or why. 6.20pm: Bad news for Europe: Kenny Perry has pulled back Westwood's lead with a birdie at the short third, and David Howell has fallen further adrift of Jim Furyk. Three holes to be exact. I advised one of my mates that Howell was a great bet for his match. I don't think he'll be too pleased. The brilliantly named Robin Pharoah tells me: \"My flatmate and I countered the chants of 'Yoo-Ess-Eh?' (U.S.A - we presume) with 'Yoo-War-Op' (Europe). We sounded cool.\" Good on ya. Latest scores: Paul Casey 6 Tiger Woods 2 up Sergio Garcia 5 Phil Mickelson 1 up A/S Darren Clarke 4 Davis Love A/S David Howell 3 Jim Furyk 2 up 1 up Lee Westwood 2 Kenny Perry 1 up Colin Montgomerie 1 David Toms Luke Donald v Chad Campbell Miguel Angel Jimenez v Chris DiMarco Thomas Levet v Fred Funk Ian Poulter v Chris Riley Padraig Harrington v Jay Haas Paul McGinley v Stewart Cink 6.27pm: Davis Love is back in charge of his match with Darren Clarke. The man with a Billy Idol haircut was unable to find the white with his putt from the edge of the green to earn a half. David Toms has just made a 25-foot putt to put Monty under pressure to hole his. The Scot's ball is on its way... it's moving very slowly down the hill... very slowly indeed... still going... but it's off line, so they're back to all square. America currently lead the top four matches and the next three are level. It's worryingly reminiscent of the surge the US made at Brookline. 6.33pm: Sergio and Big Phil are quietly making their way around the course. They're now both on the seventh with birdie opportunities. Clarke is beginning to faulter. He has just missed another lengthy putt for half, and is two holes behind. \"Hey, less of the Mars Bars!\" screams Eamonn from Dublin, who is clearly greatly concerned for my diet. He won't be pleased to hear that I've moved on to munching Hula Hoops. 6.37pm: Tiger and Casey look like they were out on the beers last night. The supposed second best player in the world is playing shots that Happy Gilmour would've been disappointed with before his fine-tuning. He has moved prematurely onto the ninth tee, premature as he hasn't passed through the eighth green yet. Sadly, Casey has been unable to capitalise as his play has been even more inauspicious. 6.41pm: There's officially blue on the board, and unsurprisingly it's next to Monty's name. David Toms' putt from three feet travelled around the lip of the hole before slinging out in the opposite direction. Monty celebrated with a Tim Cahill-style shirt over his head sprint around the green. Luke Donald has made a solid start to his match, halving the first two holes with Chad Campbell. The easily dislikeable figure of Chris DiMarco and Miguel Angel Jimenez are also all square after the first hole - that's a match which could produce fireworks if it becomes crucial later on, as the fiery Spaniard will not stand for any of DiMarco's histrionics. 6.48pm: Luke Donald has lost the third hole, putting Chad Campbell one up in their match. Westwood has also slipped behind Kenny Perry, unnoticed by the director at Sky but not by my eagle-eyes. America are ahead in the top five matches. Jimenez, though, has won the second hole, and has played a good tee shot to the par-three third. Funk and Levet halved the first hole with pars. Woods and Casey continue to have messy rounds. They seem to have been on the eighth hole for a couple of hours, but finally they've agreed to pick up and move on after a pair of bogeys. if Casey was playing a strokeplay event, he would be four over after eight holes. That he is only two shots behind shows how poorly Woods is also playing. Latest scores: Paul Casey 8 Tiger Woods 2 up Sergio Garcia 7 Phil Mickelson 1 up Darren Clarke 7 Davis Love 2 up David Howell 5 Jim Furyk 3 up Lee Westwood 5 Kenny Perry 1 up 1 up Colin Montgomerie 4 David Toms Luke Donald 3 Chad Campbell 1 up 1 up Miguel Angel Jimenez 2 Chris DiMarco A/S Thomas Levet 1 Fred Funk A/S Ian Poulter v Chris Riley Padraig Harrington v Jay Haas Paul McGinley v Stewart Cink 6.58pm: The American fans are no longer just irritating, they are now even outright liars. Shortly after Tiger had sent his tee shot towards the ninth green, one moron shouted: \"It's in the hole.\" Clearly, it was not - it was in the air. Both Tiger and Casey parred the hole so Woods is two up at the turn. Sergio has dropped another hole to Big Phil with a bogey five. This match is yet to take off, though Mickelson won't be complaining. Westwood and Jimenez have missed short putts for halves, so Forest fan Lee is two down, and Jimenez is back to all square. The putts simply aren't dropping for Europe like they have in the past two days. Ian Poulter, though, has won the first hole against beanpole Chris Riley. Poulter has not yet been spotted by the television cameras, so an update on his dresswear will follow. Whatever he is wearing, it cannot be worse than the sickly light yellow slipover that Monty is sporting. \"Hula hoops?\" scoffs Elena Papazoglu. \"Pah, real men eat Monster Munch (though Monty Lite probably gives those a miss now).\" Yes, that's my excuse - I'm eating girlie crisps in honour of our dieting boys. 7.02pm: Sergio has holed his first putt of any real distance at the short ninth, and so heads to the back nine one hole behind Mickelson. Clarke has also pulled a hole back on Davis Love. Commentator Butch Harmon is trying to assure viewers that those two are best pals, but I'm not so sure. 7.05pm: David Howell is four down after seven against Jim Furyk. That looks like a given point to the US. Kenny Perry, who was lucky to actually make contact with the ball at times on Saturday and Sunday, is in great nick today, and has just holed a winding putt for a half with Westwood. But Monty is two holes clear of David Toms after a well-judged putt across the slopes - nay, hills - of the sixth green. Niall Lambert observes: \"Looking at your photo, it must get pretty monotonous at the team wife-swapping do.\" Unfortunately, I have since changed the photo to a rather charming pic of Elin Nordegren, but you can see what he was hinting at. 7.12pm: Furyk five up against Howell. Need I say more on that one? More seriously, Jay Haas, 94, has won the first hole against Padraig Harrington. Come on Porridge! Peter Richards may have a point, though I can't tell you what it is: \"It's not 'EU -EU...' It's 'EUR' as in 'ere you are' which, in response to all the yee-hah, should - er - What I'm saying is, the US doesn't have a monopoly on morons. It may very well look that way from where you all are now, but don't we know different?(ly)\" Make of that what you will. 7.15pm: Sergio has pulled level with Mickelson with an absolute beauty of a putt for a birdie at the tenth - the first time I've felt the necessity to cheer out loud. The tension is starting to build and it looks like Europe's Ryder Cup veterans are going to have to be the ones to pick up the required points. 7.17pm: A good couple of minutes for the Irish contingent at Oakland Hills - McGinley wins the first hole and Harrington secures an eagle to draw level with Haas. 7.25pm: Lee Westwood is just one down again after a surprisingly generous concession from Kenny Perry. Sergio Garcia, who has never won a Ryder Cup singles match, could be about to win his third hole in a row after a splendid approach to the 11th green left him with a three of four-foot putt for a birdie. Mickelson wil have to hole from just off the front of the green, unless a fan runs on and chucks it a bit nearer. Latest scores: Paul Casey 11 Tiger Woods 2 up A/S Sergio Garcia 10 Phil Mickelson A/S Darren Clarke 9 Davis Love 1 up David Howell 8 Jim Furyk 5 up Lee Westwood 7 Kenny Perry 2 up 2 up Colin Montgomerie 7 David Toms Luke Donald 6 Chad Campbell 2 up A/S Miguel Angel Jimenez 4 Chris DiMarco A/S 1 up Thomas Levet 4 Fred Funk A/SIan Poulter 2 Chris Riley A/S A/S Padraig Harrington 2 Jay Haas A/S 1 up Paul McGinley 1 Stewart Cink 7.30pm: Sergio holes his putt to charge one ahead. \"Ser-gi-o!\" Westwood has just chipped from just off the treacherous green, but his ball has chosen to be awkward and roll away to end up further from the hole than it started. The little blighter. 7.33pm: The Europeans have recovered the situation a little bit. If the matches were to finish now, America would win 6.5 points, Europe 5.5 - more than enough. But, of course, it's not over until the musical trio of Westwood, Clarke and Monty have bit of a sing-song. Niall Lambert points out the first rule of matchplay: \"Try to beat the hell out of your opponent in the first few holes. Once you're ahead you can go back to the conservative stuff and let the other guy try to pull something out with an increasingly fewer number of opportunities. Looks like the Septics have taken that one to heart. (Monty lives by it. And I'm surprised by Clarke. I thought he'd be eating the lunch of a big fairy like Davis Love III.)\" Niall, you could have let the Europeans know about this tactical innovation. 7.37pm: Only seconds after Clarke sends his ball zig-zagging across the 11th green into the cup, Love does exactly the same to stay one up. These two are playing as well as anyone today. Woods has moved into a surely unassailable lead of three up with sixth to play thanks to an eagle at the 12th. Cue \"U S blah blah blah\". McGinley is two up after three against Stewart Cink, who was unable to sink his ball into the hole from five feet. Sorry. 7.42pm: Porn-star wanabee Miguel Angel Jimenez sends his ball snaking across the slippery green... and into the hole. Can Chris \"I'm American you know\" DiMarco match that? 7.44pm: No he cannot. What a shame. At the 12th, Garcia has a chance for a fourth birdie in four holes. Meanwhile, you'll be pleased to know that, according to the commentators, David Howell still seems to be enjoying playing in the Ryder Cup, even if he is five down! Bless. 7.51pm: This is not a sick joke: David Howell has won, yes won, a hole against Jim Furyk. He's only four down now. Could the greatest comeback in Ryder Cup history be on the cards? Unlikely. With Paul Casey three down with five to play against Woods, and Luke Donald now three behind Chad Campbell after eight holes, this is not proving to be the best day for the English rookies. Another debutant, Ian Poulter, is still all square against Chris Riley though. Incidentally, did anyone else think that the deifying of Riley for winning a match in the, admittedly undesirable, company of Woods was a bit over the top? 7.57pm: The Irish army trailing McGinley and Harrington are enjoying the craic, as they are three up and one up respectively. \"Oh Danny Boy...\" The Spanish contingent have plenty to celebrate too, as Sergio is two up against Big Phil, who has that familiar nervous little smirk on his face. If the scores remain as they are, a big if I know, Europe will win 17-11 - a real drubbing. \"Is there any truth to the rumour,\" begins Mark Curry, immediately implying there isn't any, \"that Karl Rove, director of the US prez reelection campaign for the elephant team, has split the ticket regarding the current disaster zones: the prez has been sent to Florida to survey the storm damage while a posse of neo-cons is being herded together to try to fix the Detroit township golf problem?\" Well, is there? 8.05pm: With Jimenez showing a steely nerve to hole an eight-foot putt for par, and Poulter making a birdie to shoot into the lead against Riley, Europe are ahead in the last five matches. Sergio has an advantage over Big Phil on the 14th green - could this be a fifth win in six holes for Sergio? Big Phil's smirk is gradually evolving into a quivering lip - where's wife Amy when he needs a hug? Latest scores: Paul Casey 14 Tiger Woods 3 up 2 up Sergio Garcia 13 Phil Mickelson Darren Clarke 13 Davis Love 1 up David Howell 11 Jim Furyk 4 up Lee Westwood 11 Kenny Perry 1 up 2 up Colin Montgomerie 10 David Toms Luke Donald 9 Chad Campbell 3 up 1 up Miguel Angel Jimenez 8 Chris DiMarco 3 up Thomas Levet 7 Fred Funk 1 upIan Poulter 7 Chris Riley 1 up Padraig Harrington 5 Jay Haas 3 up Paul McGinley 4 Stewart Cink 8.13pm: Garcia was unable to convert his good position into another victory, but his par was enough to match Big Phil's. Chad Campbell has taken another hole against Luke Donald. He's four up with eight to play, so we can probably give America that point. French superhero Thomas levet, meanwhile, is three up in his match, though Sky, and myself, have refused to comment on it, much to the chagrin of Michael Cassidy. \"If Thomas Levet is one up that probably means he's won a hole.\" Erm, three now, Michael. Sorry. \"When? How? I'm as big a Monty fan as anyone but this is a team event (oh yes, and I do live in France). You should start talking about him 'cos my sneaking feeling is that he's gonna win it for us!\" You could be right. 8.19pm: Howell's comeback was as shortlived as America's promises to be. He is now five down with five to play, which by anybody's reckoning is a hopeless position to be in. Westwood, Lee not Richard, has clawed back the deficit against Kenny Perry to all square, but Clarke is tiring in his fifth successive match, and has fallen two behind Davis Love with only four holes to play. Comically, it looks as though the US are going to edge close towards our current total of 11 points, offering them real hope, only for Europe to pull away into the distance in the end. Matthew Renshaw has emailed in: \"A question for the punters: who would win in a fight between the two teams (captains allowed to join in). Or perhaps singles fights. We think Europe, by two at least.\" Europe certainly has youth and weight on its side, though some of the Americans, notably Jim Furyk, look as though they've been in a few rucks before. USA 6 - 11 EUROPE (Woods beat Casey 3&amp;2) Casey never settled after three-putting on the first green, and although Woods was far from his best, he was too strong for the young Englishman. The world No2 has done what his captain asked, i.e. win, but it is unlikely to be enough. USA 7 - 11 EUROPE (Furyk beat Howell 6&amp;4) Another English rookie bites the dust. Furyk wins the 14th hole to secure a victory which was as inevitable as me missing the winning putt to buy another Mars bar. Howell was all over the place from the first hole, and with Furyk determined to seek revenge for his four losses in the first two days, this was no contest. 8.33pm: Sergio could be about to wrap up his first Ryder Cup singles victory after Mickelson thrashed his second shot into the water at the 16th. Big Phil has been in terrbile form this week, and the Spaniard has capitalised brilliantly. Monty has won the 13th hole to send him one up once more against Toms. This one is turning out to be a battle of attrition. Keith Brazil says: \"I heard that if the Europeans win (if??), their wives are going to run onto the final green and widdle in unison in response to the American wives' actions from a few years back. Please confirm.\" Confirmed. USA 7 - 12 EUROPE (Garcia beat Mickelson 3&amp;2) Sergio's arms are aloft and his ball is in the crowd. Nope, he hasn't lost his temper with the American crowd, he's just beaten Big Phil. A wonderful performance to come from behind against the American No2. 8.46pm: Darren Clarke has kept his match alive on the 16th green with a gutsy seven-foot putt (approximately, it could have been 14 feet for all I know). With Clarke's ball now firmly set just off the 17th green while Love's lies in a nearby bunker, the cigar-puffer still has hope of a point. Swings and roundabouts in the bottom matches, with Levet dropping a hole, but McGinley picking another one up. Niall Lambert is desperately pleading with me to get a picture of Kristen Scott Thomas. Why, I'm not entirely sure. But I'll see what I can do, Niall. Latest scores: Paul Casey LOST TO Tiger Woods 3&amp;2 3&amp;2 Sergio Garcia BEAT Phil Mickelson Darren Clarke 16 Davis Love 1 up David Howell LOST TO Jim Furyk 6&amp;4 A/S Lee Westwood 14 Kenny Perry A/S 1 up Colin Montgomerie 14 David Toms Luke Donald 13 Chad Campbell 4 up A/S Miguel Angel Jimenez 12 Chris DiMarco A/S 2 up Thomas Levet 11 Fred Funk 1 up Ian Poulter 10 Chris Riley 2 up Padraig Harrington 9 Jay Haas 4 up Paul McGinley 8 Stewart Cink 8.52pm: A marvellously delicate chip from Clarke trickles into the hole to draw him level with Love. The aptly name American, to his credit, offers his congratulations to the Ulsterman. On the 18th, Clarke's drive has found the fairway, but Love's has been merely found wanting. Chris DiMarco has just missed a four-foot putt to pull all square against Jimenez. Terribly hard luck. By the by, it is noticeable that the commentators have begun to use the first person plural pronoun. Nobody likes such clearly biased commentary, do they? 8.59pm: Moments ago Luke Donald's participation in this year's Ryder Cup was millimetres away from ending when Chad Campbell's putt dribbled next to the hole. Donald will have to journey to the 15th before he is put out of his misery. Having won the 15th, Lee Westwood has halved the 16th with Kenny Perry. This see-saw battle may yet have one last sting in the tail. Click here for the latest updates."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
