Justin King, the chief exec utive appointed six months ago to turn the company around, will this week take a savage axe to managerial jobs at its expensive Holborn office, but will also unveil plans to take on up to 3,000 staff to fulfill basic customer needs in its stores. The move will be presented as a sharp contrast to the formula of the old regime under Sir Peter Davis, who invested heavily in delivery and depot management technology. King sees the failure of these systems - which cost some \u00a33 billion over three years - as the crux of the problems and is in talks with the suppliers to correct the deficiencies. 'Customers just couldn't buy the things they wanted. The irony is that the goods were in the depots or stores, but didn't make it to the shelves in time,' said an expert. The new approach - cutting up to 700 management 'suits' while hiring cheaper 'shelf-stackers' - is the central plank of King's strategy, which will be promoted to the City with the catchline 'Getting the Basics Right'. It will involve financial pain for shareholders - including the Sainsbury family, with their 38 per cent stake. The dividend is expected to be halved. King is also expected to outline a new pricing strategy which, while not competing with the price-cutting strategy of Tesco and Asda, will, he hopes, lure customers back into the stores. Friends say he is optimistic that rising sales and tightly controlled costs could mean steady profits growth two years from now. But analysts are not expecting a quick fix. Several have lowered forecasts in recent weeks, slashing expected earnings to \u00a3254 million this year and \u00a3220m next. Analysts at JP Morgan have lowered the current year fore cast to \u00a3271m. Philip Dorgan at Panmure Gordon, said: 'Much of the \u00a33bn spent over the past four years has been value-destructive. The \u00a3710m cumulative cost savings achieved over the past four years have largely been at the expense of the customer.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
