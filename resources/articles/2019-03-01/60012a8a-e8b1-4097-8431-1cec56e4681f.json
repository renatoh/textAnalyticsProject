A video of the incident published by TMZ on Friday shows Baer attempting to take a cell phone from his wife, Pamela, pulling her to the ground as she shouts: \u201cOh my God, no, help!\u201d Baer confirmed he got into an \u201cunfortunate public argument\u201d with his wife in an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, saying he\u2019s apologized to his wife and police were not initially contacted, though Chronicle reporter Evan Sernoffsky said authorities later turned up at the scene in the city\u2019s Hayes Valley neighborhood to speak with witnesses. \u201cMy wife and I had an unfortunate public argument related to a family member and she had an injured foot and she fell off her chair in the course of the argument,\u201d Baer said. \u201cThe matter is resolved. It was a squabble over a cell phone. Obviously it\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d Baer, 61, joined the Giants as the team\u2019s marketing director in 1980, working his way up and succeeding Bill Neukom as the team\u2019s CEO in 2012. The couple, who has four children together, has been married for 28 years. A team spokesperson responded to request for comment from the Guardian with a joint statement from Larry and Pamela Baer, saying they were \u201cdeeply embarrassed\u201d by the incident. \u201cRegrettably today we had a heated argument in public over a family matter,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe are deeply embarrassed by the situation and have resolved the issue.\u201d Major League Baseball released a statement saying that it \u201cis aware of the incident and, just like any other situation like this, will immediately begin to gather the facts. We will have no further comment until this process is completed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
