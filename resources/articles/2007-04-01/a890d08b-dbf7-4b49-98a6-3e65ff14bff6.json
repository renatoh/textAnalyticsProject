Colin Montgomerie responded to his crushing loss at last year's US Open at Winged Foot by getting into an argument with a New York state trooper. Like the combustible Scotsman 10 months ago, Justin Rose was the creator of his own downfall on Sunday, taking double bogey on the 71st hole of the 2007 Masters when par would have given him a realistic chance of catching the eventual winner Zach Johnson. But unlike Monty, the 26-year-old Englishman took his disappointment on the chin. \"I didn't drive the ball well on the 17th all week, to be honest with you. It's such a narrow target and I don't think I hit that fairway once all week. But I didn't hit it too badly this time. It just leaked about 10 yards right and at first I thought it had kicked left, which would have been a lucky break. But somehow it flew about 100 yards right on to the 15th fairway and I was dead from there. I had to go for broke and I tried to hit a four-wood to the green. But I could never get it high enough in time and it cost me a double. \"But until then I really felt I was going to do something special. I really fancied myself down the stretch because of how calm I felt and how in control of my emotions I felt. I was ice cool, and normally I get a bit jittery and nervous in those situations. My inner calm was really positive and really pleasing. I was actually able to enjoy the day. I turned to Mick [Doran, his caddie] a couple of times when the crowds were urging us on and said, 'How great is this?'.\" Rose has long been world-class when it comes to handling himself in front of the media but after four days during which a brutal Augusta National course stretched the Masters' reputations as one of sport's most enthralling events, he finally established himself as a world-class player. It has been a long time coming. Or at least it has felt that way because Rose was so talented, so young. When he holed his 80-yard pitch shot on the final hole of the 1998 Open at Birkdale, earning him a share of fourth place, it seemed as if he need only turn professional and his transformation into a superstar would be guaranteed. But the professional game does not work like that, at least not unless your name happens to be Tiger Woods. Those less gifted than the world No1 - and let's face it, who isn't? - need to work hard if they want to share in the game's generous rewards. Rose has worked as hard as anyone. He also had to endure more troubles than most, not least the streak of 21 missed cuts that heralded his arrival into the professional game. But while there were many who were prepared to write him off as yet another teenage prodigy who got too much praise far too soon, the young Englishman ploughed on, occasionally showing flashes of the player he had promised to be. He won twice on the European tour in 2002, and played well enough on the PGA tour to keep his card. The breakthrough came after he dropped his long-time coach David Leadbetter last year and hired Nick Bradley. The latter's simpler approach to teaching the swing had an immediate impact. Five top-10 finishes on the PGA tour last year, coupled with another European tour victory, this time in Australia, lifted Rose into the world's top 50 and earned his spot at Augusta National. As he had done at the 2004 Masters, the Englishman led after the first round, and maintained a place near the top of the leaderboard until he made double-double bogeys at two of the first three holes on Sunday afternoon. Lesser players would have been crushed but Rose responded with a champion's will, chiselling five birdies out of Augusta's granite-hard challenge. \"The turning point was when I made about a nine-footer for par on the 5th. The adrenalin surged there and I still felt the win was on,\" he said. \"When things go wrong you just have to keep telling yourself, 'Come on, create a different story. You have still got a chance of winning. You're the comeback kid. Think of all the knocks you've taken in the past and bounced back from. You can still do this - it will be the greatest comeback Augusta has seen since Jack Nicklaus won in 1986'.\" Alas, there is only one Nicklaus. But Rose can console himself that his chance is likely to come again - and when it does he will know that he, too, has what it takes. Major winners we'll, er, never forget 1987 Masters The Augusta native Larry Mize chipped in for birdie from 140ft at the second play-off hole, the 11th, to beat Greg Norman. 1987 US Open Scott Simpson birdied the 14th, 15th and 16th to beat Tom Watson by one stroke at the Olympic club. They were the only two to beat par but in major terms that was it for Simpson. 1991 Open An outward nine of 29 set up a closing 66 to defeat Mike Harwood by two. But Australia's Ian Baker-Finch then lost all confidence, retiring in 1997. 1996 US PGA After a birdie at the 72nd at Valhalla to force a play-off with Kenny Perry, the 35-year-old Mark Brooks then birdied the first extra hole to win the title. 1999 The Open Paul Lawrie won a four-hole play-off at Carnoustie with a birdie-birdie finish which saw off water-disaster Jean van der Velde and Justin Leonard."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
