The tournament hosts took the lead through their captain, Sherida Spitse, who scored a 27th-minute penalty, before Belgium\u2019s Tessa Wullaert hit a bizarre long-range strike to level the scores, the first goal Holland have conceded all tournament. Belgium pushed for a winner but again fell behind when Lieke Martens\u2019s deflected shot found its way past Justien Odeurs. Martens, later voted the player of the match, cut in from the left and curled her shot for the far corner, only for it to hit Heleen Jaques and wrongfoot Odeurs. Holland go through with maximum points from their three games after victories over Denmark and Norway and will face the Group B runners-up on Saturday in Doetinchem. \u201cOf course there is pressure,\u201d said Holland\u2019s head coach, Sarina Wiegman. \u201cWe are playing on home soil and want to win all our matches. We do have a mental coach but we have prepared well for the matches. In the past women\u2019s football was just there but now the people start to love the women\u2019s game and the team as well and I hope that this adds to the development of women\u2019s football.\u201d In Group A\u2019s other game, an early strike from Katrine Veje helped Denmark to a 1-0 win over the 2013 finalists Norway. After losing 1-0 to Holland and 2-0 to Belgium, Norway knew they had to win to qualify but got off to the worst possible start with Denmark\u2019s Pernille Harder capitalising on a slip from Nora Holstad Berge, before passing to Veje who powered home from the edge of the area after five minutes. Norway were unlucky not to equalise \u2013 they had a penalty saved, hit the woodwork twice and had more possession \u2013 but ultimately could not break Denmark down. This is the first time Norway\u2019s women have failed to win a single game in any major tournament group stage and the first time since 1997 they have failed to progress from a European Championship group stage. Denmark will play the winners of Group B \u2013 containing Sweden, Germany, Russia and Italy \u2013 who play their final games on Tuesday evening."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
