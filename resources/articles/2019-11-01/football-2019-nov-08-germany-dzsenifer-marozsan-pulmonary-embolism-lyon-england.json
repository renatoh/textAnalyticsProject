The blood clot in a lung that briefly threatened Marozs\u00e1n\u2019s career has left her wearing compression stockings when travelling between matches but her exceptional talent continues to thrive in the tightest spaces. Few coaches can devise the sort of tactical tourniquet capable of stifling her creativity. At least Phil Neville has been adequately warned about the threat awaiting his Lionesses from Germany\u2019s midfield on Saturday. During the summer\u2019s World Cup in France, England\u2019s coach described Lucy Bronze as \u201cthe world\u2019s best female footballer\u201d but his right-back was quick to correct him. \u201cIt\u2019s Dzsenifer Marozs\u00e1n,\u201d said Bronze, identifying her Lyon teammate, roommate and good friend. \u201cShe\u2019s the world\u2019s best player. It\u2019s a lovely compliment from Phil but I don\u2019t believe him. You rarely see anyone with as much ability as Dzsenifer. \u201cThe only player I could really compare her to is Kelly Smith. Dzsenifer\u2019s just got so much raw talent; I\u2019ll never be able to hit a ball like she does. She\u2019s so tricky and skilful. I love Marozs\u00e1n.\u201d Purists have long adored an attacking midfielder expert at operating \u201cbetween the lines\u201d but she is also big on end-product; her 96 international games have produced 32 goals. Born in Budapest, Marozs\u00e1n moved to south-west Germany as a small child when her professional footballer father, Janos \u2013 capped four times by Hungary \u2013 signed for Saarbr\u00fccken and they settled close to the French border. Once Marozs\u00e1n\u2019s talent with the ball at her feet became apparent, the German football federation encouraged her to switch allegiances, eventually nationalising the whole family. At the age of 14 years and seven months she made her first-team debut for Saarbr\u00fccken, before, at 15, becoming the youngest player to appear in the Frauen Bundesliga. Now 27, the No 10 made a full international debut in 2010, subsequently helping her adopted country win Euro 2013 in Sweden and securing Olympic gold in Brazil three years later. Marozs\u00e1n has won the Women\u2019s Champions League four times, initially with Frankfurt and on three occasions with Lyon. She believes moving to France\u2019s elegant second city three years ago has \u201cimproved\u201d her \u201cas a person\u201d and, after some initial struggles, is proud of achieving fluency in French. \u201cI feel completely at home in Lyon,\u201d she says. \u201cThe food\u2019s completely amazing. I\u2019ve eaten more cheese in the past three years than in my entire life.\u201d However, in the summer of 2018 her entire future was threatened when she suffered that pulmonary embolism. Despite being ultimately sidelined for only three months and ending the season lifting three domestic trophies, for a while there were genuine fears Marozs\u00e1n might never play again. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t a nice situation,\u201d she says. \u201cI was in pain and had to go to hospital. The first moment you\u2019re diagnosed with a lung embolism you\u2019re shocked, your family\u2019s shocked and the worst thoughts go through your head. \u201cAfter a week, though, it became clear I would fight back. I got a lot of support which gave me courage and strength and, now, I\u2019m just happy to be back on the pitch. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been in this situation you realise how important it is to enjoy every day, because it can happen any day. So I\u2019m really calm now. If I get a little injury, I say to myself: \u2018There are a lot of worse things. Be calm and you\u2019ll be fine soon.\u2019 Now I just enjoy every moment.\u201d It seems such pleasure has been enhanced by Marozs\u00e1n\u2019s decision to relinquish the captaincy given to her by the former national coach Steffi Jones. Even so, she continues to be an unofficial dressing-room leader, using her experience to quietly \u2013 she is not a shouter or finger-pointer \u2013 help bring the best out in a young, still somewhat transitional squad. \u201cYou need characters who go out and win a game, who take the lead and the responsibility,\u201d says Germany\u2019s coach, Martina Voss-Tecklenburg. \u201cPlayers who\u2019ll look you in the eye when things are rough and tell you what\u2019s what.\u201d It seems a case of what might have been had Marozs\u00e1n been fit for Germany at the past three World Cups. In 2011 a knee injury sidelined her and although she travelled to Canada 2015, ankle trouble restricted the playmaker\u2019s contribution to the run to a third-place play-off defeat by England. France 2019, meanwhile, was wrecked by a broken toe, limiting her involvement as Sweden beat Voss-Tecklenburg\u2019s side in the quarter-finals. The bad news for England is that a creative catalyst Neville regards as an international role model is expected to grace Wembley in peak condition. Bev Priestman, his assistant, recently watched Lyon train and returned full of admiration. \u201cBev said Marozs\u00e1n gets five mannequins, puts them out on the pitch and starts practising free-kicks on her own,\u201d says England\u2019s coach. \u201cThat\u2019s the behaviour of an elite player.\u201d With WSL clubs restricted by a wage cap \u2013 only 40% of turnover can be spent on player remuneration \u2013 English teams are unlikely to be able to afford Marozs\u00e1n any time soon so Saturday will offer fans a rare glimpse of her balletic grace in action."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
