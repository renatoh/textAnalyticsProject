The FBI accused North Korea of the cyberattack on Sony over its film The Interview. The agency cited analysis of malware and similarities to past hacks by North Koreans as evidence. No other country was implicated in the attack, President Barack Obama said in a briefing with reporters. \u201cWe will respond,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will respond proportionally, and in a place and time that we choose.\u201d Obama said Sony made a mistake by acceding to the hackers\u2019 demands that its satirical film be scrapped. \u201cWe cannot have a society where some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States \u2026That\u2019s not who we are.\u201d Sony chairman Michael Lynton insisted his company made no such mistake and would still try to distribute The Interview. He tried to shift blame onto the theaters that refused to carry the film after the hackers\u2019 threats. A North Korean diplomat denied any connection between the country and the hack, saying \u201cDPRK is not part of this.\u201d The country\u2019s ambassador to the UN had previously described The Interview as \u201can act of war\u201d. Obama urged Congress to pass a cybersecurity bill that would codify rules for information sharing between the government and private sector. He also answered questions at length about Cuba, race relations and the Keystone XL pipeline. \u201cThis is a problem that\u2019s going to be with us for a very long time,\u201d Senator Dianne Feinstein has announced from the pulpit of CNN. Feinstein, the chair of the Senate intelligence committee, said it is imperative that Congress pass legislation that would \u201callow companies to share information with each other and the government \u2026 and be protected from liability for doing so.\u201d Pressed by Jake Tapper on the question of whether Sony made a mistake, she refused to assign blame, saying she thought that chairman Michael Lynton \u201cdid practice all due diligence, he did call the White House, he recognizes there are contracts with big theater companies.\u201d \u201cThis is a complicated matter \u2026if something were to happen, who is liable for a loss of life?\u201d She instead returned to the responsibility of the federal government \u201cto respond appropriately, imminently.\u201d \u201cThis can\u2019t continue to happen in my view. This is a problem that\u2019s going to be with us for a very long time. so we have to get certain strictures in place to get a handle on it.\u201d \u201cI hope we can convince the North Koreans that this action has a very heavy price.\u201d Finally, Feinstein urged US allies to write an international accord on cybersecurity, saying that the US has already been attacked by hackers in China, Russia, Iran and the states. \u201cAt some point if we face a disastrous attack, and this is what we must prevent, only an international agreement [can] solve it.\u201d Sony made no mistake in pulling The Interview, the company\u2019s chairman insists, despite President Obama\u2019s assertion that they did just that. Michael Lynton told CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria that Sony \u201cexperienced the worst cyberattack in American history and persevered under enormous stress for months.\u201d Lynton tries to shift blame onto the theaters at \u201cthe crucial moment that the threat came out, from what was called the GOP at the time\u201d. \u201cThe movie theaters came to us one by one over the course of a very short period of time, and announced that the would not carry the film. At that point we had no [choice] but to not proceed. And that\u2019s all.\u201d The CEO even argued \u201cwe have not backed down\u201d and said that Sony still has \u201cevery desire to have the American public see this movie.\u201d He said the company is considering \u201ca number of options\u201d, but that it requires an intermediary such as Netflix or a video-on-demand distributor. None, he said, have \u201cstepped forward and said they are willing.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t have that direct interface with the American public.\u201d Asked by Zakaria whether he\u2019d still make the film, Lynton tried to put on a brave face: \u201cI would make the movie again, for the same reasons we made it in the first place. It was a funny comedy, it served as political satire. Knowing what I know now we might\u2019ve done some things slightly differently, but I think a lot of events have overtaken us in a way we have no control of.\u201d The Interview is not the only film that distributors are shying from in the wake of the Sony cyberattack: Paramount Pictures has pulled the 2004 comedy Team America: World Police from screenings in a handful of theaters around the US. Courtesy my colleague Oliver Laughland (@oliverlaughland): Paramount has contacted cinemas to inform them Team America, which depicts the death of former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, has been pulled from release. A spokesman for the Capitol Theatre in Cleveland told the Guardian the studio did not offer any reason for the film\u2019s removal. The cinema had booked Team America back in October for a late-night cult screening. The Alamo Drafthouse cinema in Dallas had booked a screening of the film after The Interview was dropped, but announced on Twitter this too had been pulled \u201cdue to circumstances beyond our control\u201d. The Plaza cinema in Atlanta also tweeted it had pulled a screening of Team America. The 2004 film, which sees Kim Jong-il played by a puppet and killed after he is impaled on the spike of a bavarian helmet, grossed over $50m at the box office. After his death, Kim is revealed to be an alien cockroach from the fictional planet Gyron. The Guardians of Peace have warned Sony to \u201cnever let the movie released, distributed or leaked in any form of, for instance, DVD or piracy\u201d, the Associated Press reports. The email was confirmed by a person close to the studio who requested anonymity because the person wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly about the matter. It was sent to several employees of the Culver City, California, company that\u2019s been roiled by a hacking group calling itself Guardians of Peace. \u201cVery wise to cancel \u2018the interview\u2019 it will be very useful for you,\u201d read the message. \u201cWe ensure the purity of your data and as long as you make no more trouble.\u201d The email also warned against any release of the Seth Rogen, James Franco comedy and insisted that \u201canything related to the movie, including trailers\u201d be removed from the Internet. \u201cNow we want you never let the movie released, distributed or leaked in any form of, for instance, DVD or piracy,\u201d wrote the hackers. \u201cIt\u2019s above us now at government level,\u201d said the person close to Sony. Joshua Pollack, a North Korea watcher and associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies, is reading between the lines of various statements. How the administration classifies the hack could affect its response. North Korea was removed from the list of state sponsors of terror in 2008, and hawkish senator John McCain said the cyberattack was \u201can act of war\u201d earlier Friday. So what happens to The Interview, asks my colleague Peter Bradshaw from the Guardian\u2019s film desk, a question he answers in piece all about censorship and the states eager to stop writers like Salman Rushdie and comedians like Seth Rogen. Despite being withdrawn from cinemas, and having no theatrical or DVD release schedule, it will certainly surface. Variety\u2019s Steven Gaydosshrewdly commented that it will of course become freely available online using precisely the same BitTorrent technology that the North Korean cyber-warriors used for their hacking. On another commercial and diplomatic level, questions will be asked in Los Angeles and Washington about exactly how much China knew about all this. Sony Pictures have led the way in partnerships with the Chinese film industry: even planning a Chinese remake of My Best Friend\u2019s Wedding. All this might be under strain. Perhaps, in any case, Hollywood misread the nature of the North Korea regime. Despite its authoritarianism and instinctive suspicion and loathing for anything that smacks of artistic freedom, it does take cinema very seriously. The Pyongyang international film festival, however bureaucratic and sclerotic, is a rare North Korean institution to which outsiders are theoretically invited (it even showed Bend It Like Beckham once). You can read the full piece, titled \u201cSony\u2019s retreat signals an unprecedented defeat on American turf,\u201d here. A quick look at the day\u2019s developments. The FBI accused North Korea of the cyberattack on Sony over its film The Interview. The agency cited analysis of malware and similar hacks by North Koreans as evidence. No other country was implicated in the attack, President Barack Obama said in a briefing with reporters. \u201cWe will respond,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will respond proportionally, and in a place and time that we choose.\u201d Obama said Sony made a mistake by acceding to the hackers\u2019 demands that its satirical film be scrapped. \u201cWe cannot have a society where some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States \u2026That\u2019s not who we are.\u201d A North Korean diplomat denied any connection between the country and the hack, saying \u201cDPRK is not part of this.\u201d The country\u2019s ambassador to the UN had previously described The Interview as \u201can act of war\u201d. Obama urged Congress to pass a cybersecurity bill that would codify rules for information sharing between the government and private sector. He also answered questions at length about Cuba, race relations and the Keystone XL pipeline. Obama ended with a reflection on the past year and his entire presidency: \u201cOne of the great things about this job is you get to meet American people of every race and every faith. And what I don\u2019t think is always captured in our political debates is that the vast majority of people are trying to do the right thing. And people are basically good and have good intentions. Sometimes our institutions don\u2019t work [as well]. Maybe police departments [do the wrong thing and] surface hidden biases.\u201d He says videos like that of Eric Garner\u2019s death \u201ctrouble everybody\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through difficult times. It is your job, press corps, to report on all the mistakes that are made and all the bad things that happen and crises that look like they\u2019re popping, and I understand that. \u201cBut through persistent effort and faith in the American people, things get better.\u201d Obama listed the economy, energy, education and other issues as having improved over the past six years. \u201cPart of what I hope as we reflect on the new year is this should generate some confidence. When we work together we can\u2019t be stopped. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m going on vacation.\u201d One last question gets in, on the topic of race relations in the US. \u201cBlack America in the aggregate is better off than when I came into office,\u201d Obama said. He continued: \u201cThis is a legacy of a troubled racial past, but that\u2019s not an excuse for black folks, and I think the overwhelming majority of black folks understand that\u2019s not an excuse.\u201d People are working hard, \u201chustling every day\u201d, Obama said. \u201cThey\u2019re starting behind oftentimes in the race. What\u2019s true for all Americans is we should be willing to provide people a hand up \u2013 not a handout. Help them afford college, and if we can help them succeed that\u2019s going to be good for all of us. \u201cA lot of what we\u2019re seeing is coloured by Ferguson, and what we\u2019ve seen in New York, and that is that there are specific instances at least where law enforcement doesn\u2019t feel as if it\u2019s being applied in a colorblind fashion. \u201cThe taskforce that I\u2019ve formed is supposed to respond back to me in 90 days \u2013 not with a bunch of abstract musings about race relations but some really concrete practical things that law enforcement, and police departments, can begin using right now.\u201d Obama also responded to a question about the broader press around police killings and existing divides between black and white Americans. \u201cI actually think it\u2019s been a healthy conversation. This is not a new phenomenon. You\u2019re not going to solve the problem if it\u2019s not being talked about.\u201d The Keystone XL pipeline comes up in what Obama says is the last question. Obama: \u201cAt issue in Keystone is not American oil. It is Canadian oil, that is drawn out of tar sands. That oil, currently, is being shipped out, through rails and trucks, and it would save Canadian companies and the Canadian oil industry an enormous amount of money if they could simply pump it through the United States down to the Gulf. \u201cThere\u2019s very little impact, nominal impact, on US gas prices, what the average consumer American cares about, by having this Canadian oil get through. \u201cAnd sometimes the implication is that gas prices are going to go lower here in the States, but they\u2019re not. It\u2019s good for Canadian oil companies. But it\u2019s not going to be even a nominal benefit to American jobs.\u201d He talks more about jobs. \u201cNow the creation of the pipeline itself is probably going to create a couple of thousand jobs. There\u2019s probably a couple additional jobs that can be created in the refining process down at the Gulf.\u201d Those aren\u2019t insignificant, he says, but next to the jobs created by work on roads and bridges they simply don\u2019t compare. He pitches infrastructure to Congress again. \u201cWe could probably create hundreds of thousands of jobs, or a million jobs, so if that\u2019s the argument there are lots of ways to create American jobs. \u201cI want to make sure that if in fact this process goes forward, I want to make sure it\u2019s not adding to the problem of climate change, which I do consider a very serious issue. And it does increase the cost to the American people.\u201d Asked about politics and Congress, Obama says he takes Speaker John Boehner and Mitch McConnell at their word that they want to work with the president and not against him. The reporter also asks about his streak of executive actions, like on immigration. \u201cThe question\u2019s going to be if executive actions on areas like minimum wage or equal pay, or a more sensible immigration system \u2013 if those are important to Republicans or if executive action bothers them, there is a very simple solution: pass legislation.\u201d He says both Democrats and Republicans simply need to start finding compromises again. A reporter now asks what happens if Cuba\u2019s human rights abuses worsen. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that over the next two years we can\u2019t anticipate and take certain actions that we may find deeply troubling, either inside of Cuba or with respect to their foreign policy. And that could put significant strains on the relationship,\u201d Obama replies. \u201cBut that\u2019s true of a lot of countries out there where we have an embassy. \u201cAnd the whole point of normalizing relations gives us the greater opportunity to have an influence.\u201d Obama says he would be surprised if the Castro regime \u201cmoves to effectively undermine their own policy\u201d. \u201cThere will be carrots and sticks that we can apply.\u201d Asked about whether Fidel came up in his conversation with President Raul Castro of Cuba, Obama says that the ex-president was mentioned only in passing. Obama says he took about 15 minutes to get his preliminary remarks out of the way, \u201cand the end of my remarks I apologised for taking such a long time.\u201d \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it Mr President, you still have a chance to break Fidel\u2019s record, he once spoke for seven hours straight.\u2019 And then Raul gave his own preliminary remarks that lasted at least twice as long as mine, and that gave me the opportunity to say \u2018it runs in the family\u2019.\u201d About the embargo: \u201cWe can\u2019t unilaterally bring down the embargo. But what I do think is going to happen is there\u2019s going to be a process where Congress digests it; there are bipartisan supporters [...] people will see the reactions that unfold. I think there\u2019s going to be a healthy debate in Congress.\u201d \u201cWe have no indication that North Korea was acting in conjunction with another country,\u201d Obama said in relation to the Sony hack. He is then asked about Cuba, and his position on the regime and human rights abuses there. \u201cWe are glad Cuba has released more than 50 dissidents,\u201d he says, adding that he\u2019s glad Raul Castro agreed to work with the UN and international groups. \u201cI share the concerns of dissidents there and human rights activists. This is still a regime that represses its people. As I said in the announcement I don\u2019t anticipiate overnight changes. But I know deep in my bones that if you do the same thing for 50 years and nothing\u2019s changed, you\u2019ve got to do something else.\u201d Then he moves onto the long term strategy of the tectonic shift in US-Cuban relations. \u201cSuddenly Cuba is open to the world in ways it hasn\u2019t been. It\u2019s open to Americans. It\u2019s open to church groups visiting their fellow believers in ways they haven\u2019t before. It opens the prospect of telecommunications and the internet. \u201cAnd over time that chips away at this hermetically sealed society, and I believe that offers the best prospect of greater freedom, greater self-determination of the Cuban people. I think it\u2019ll happen in fits and starts, but we\u2019ll have a better chance.\u201d \u201cChange is going to come to Cuba, it has to. They\u2019ve been reliant for years, first on subsidies from the Soviet Union, then from Venezuela.\u201d It has to change, Obama says, though he doesn\u2019t know how quickly. Obama now talks about pushing infrastructure in the next Congress. \u201cWe are way behind, and early on we indicated that there\u2019s a way to incorporate corporate tax reform [...] eliminating loopholes so that everybody\u2019s doing their fair share. Infrastructure has historically not been a Democrat or Republican issue, and I\u2019d like to return to that.\u201d Obama then banters a bit with a Politico reporter who is leaving for Brussels. He tells her he\u2019ll miss her around the White House and wishes her the best of luck: \u201cI think that what Belgium needs is some, uh, version of Politico.\u201d \u201cI think it says something about North Korea,\u201d Obama said, that it would \u201cmount an all-out attack over a satirical film \u2026 starring Seth Rogen.\u201d \u201cThat gives you a sense of the regime we\u2019re talking about here.\u201d Asked about how the US will respond, Obama shut down the line of questioning: \u201cWe will respond, we will respond proportionally, and in a place and time that we choose. It\u2019s not something that I will announce here today at this press conference.\u201d \u201cMore broadly, this shows we need to cooperate [with international partners] on [cyber security]. Right now, it\u2019s sort of a wild west. And part of the problem is you\u2019ve got weak states that can engage in these kinds of attacks, you\u2019ve got non-state actors [...] that\u2019s part of what makes this issue so important.\u201d Obama then made another push for Congress to draft a cyber security bill for information-sharing between the government and private companies and organisations. Obama continued: \u201cWe cannot have a society where some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States. Because if somebody\u2019s going to intimidate [Sony] for releasing a satirical movie, imagine what\u2019s going to happen when there\u2019s a documentary they don\u2019t like. \u201cEven worse, if producers and distributors start engaging in self-censorship because they don\u2019t want to offend the sensibilities of somebody who frankly probably needs their sensibilities offended. \u201cThat\u2019s not who we are. That\u2019s not who Americans are.\u201d \u201cAgain, I\u2019m sympathetic to Sony \u2013 but I wish they had spoken to me first.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll engage with not just the film industry but the news industry, and the private sector. \u201cAll of us need to anticipate that occasionally there are going to be breaches like this. But we can\u2019t start changing our patterns of behavior anymore than we would stop going to a football game because there might be a terrorist attack. Any more than Boston didn\u2019t run its marathon this year.\u201d Q: What does a proportional response look like to the [Sony] hack? Did Sony make the right response by pulling the film? Obama: \u201cSony\u2019s a corporation, it suffered significant damage. There were threats against its employees. I am sympathetic to the concerns that they face. \u201cThat being said, yes, I think they made a mistake.\u201d \u201cOur first order of business is to try to prevent those attacks from taking place. \u201cEverything that we can do at the government level to prevent these types of attacks [we\u2019re doing]. We\u2019re coordinating with the private sector but we\u2019re not even close to where we need to be. \u201cWe need strong cybersecurity laws that provide for data sharing.\u201d Obama: \u201cI\u2019m energized, I\u2019m excited about the prospects of the next couple of years, and I\u2019m certainly not going to be stopping for a minute in the effort of making life better for ordinary Americans. \u201cThanks to their efforts, we are better positioned than we have been in a very long time.\u201d \u201cMy presidency\u2019s entering the fourth quarter. Interesting stuff happens in the fourth quarter. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d He finishes off with basketball before taking questions. Obama says the administration has \u201crepaid taxpayers every dime\u201d that went into the bailouts of 2009, and says the Affordable Care Act has helped more than 10 million Americans gain health insurance. \u201cMeanwhile, around the world, America is leading. We\u2019re leading the campaign to degrade and destroy. We\u2019re leading the [coalition] to check Russian aggression in Ukraine.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re leading efforts to combat climate change. [\u2026] We\u2019re writing a new chapter here in the Americas by [changing] our relationship with Cuba.\u201d Obama says 2014 will end with more members of the military home than there have been in a decade. \u201cTake any metric you want, America\u2019s resurgence is real. We\u2019re better off.\u201d President Obama arrives on stage: \u201cAll I want for Christmas is to take your questions.\u201d \u201cI said that 2014 would be a year of action and would be a breakthrough year for America. It has been. Yes, there were crises around the world, and many were unanticipated. \u201cThere is no doubt that we can enter into the new year with renewed confidence that America is making significant strides where it counts.\u201d Obama now talks a bit about increasing jobs, wages, oil and natural gas production, and manufacturing investment. A North Korea\u2019s diplomat says the country has no connection to the Sony hacking incident, Reuters reports. The diplomat declined to comment further to Reuters and spoke only on condition of anonymity: \u201cDPRK is not part of this.\u201d Voice of America\u2019s Steve Herman has heard the same refrain, which has been the country\u2019s stance since it first denied involvement on 4 December. Not all nations have left North Korea in the cold \u2013 Russian President Vladimir Putin has invited Kim Jong-un to visit next year, Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov tells state-owned Tass news outlet. Peskov told Tass that Putin had invited his Pyongyang counterpart to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany. If Kim travels to Moscow, it would be his first trip abroad since he succeeded his father as leader of North Korea. In November Kim\u2019s personal envoy met with Kremlin officials in Moscow to strengthen ties between nations. Pyongyang hopes Russia can provide international leverage on issues like its nuclear program and aid, and the Kremlin wants to build a gas pipeline through North Korea to export fuel to the south. President Obama is scheduled to speak in just under five minutes \u2013 just enough time for you to read a bit about the film that so enraged North Korea\u2019s leadership. The Guardian\u2019s Jordan Hoffman, one of the few people who\u2019s seen the sophomoric comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, declared it \u201cidiotic\u201d, \u201cchuckle-rich\u201d and featuring a depiction of Kim Jong-un as \u201cactually a great deal of fun\u201d. You can read his review here, or watch the trailer below \u2013 still online despite the hacker\u2019s demands that even these clips vanish. North Korea has denied involvement in the hack, but even the most generous reading of a string of public statements from isolated nation suggest its leaders are being less than forthcoming. Unnamed officials also said in June that the DPRK would have a \u201cmerciless response\u201d should the film be released, and that the movie stank of American \u201cdesperation\u201d. Then, in July, North Korea\u2019s ambassador to the UN complained about the film to general-secretary Ban Ki-moon, writing \u201cto allow the production and distribution of such a film on the assassination of an incumbent head of a sovereign state should be regarded as the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as an act of war.\u201d Finally, in December, North Korea said Sony cyberattack could be the \u201crighteous\u201d work of its supporters but denied any direct responsibility. You can check out the full timeline of the The Interview\u2019s troubled story here. Former senator Chris Dodd, the head of the MPAA, says the cyberattack was a \u201cdespicable, criminal act\u201d, Reuters reports, quoting the first statement from a major Hollywood studio about the hack. Actors have been less reserved in their criticism not just of the hackers but of the press and each other. George Clooney said Thursday that \u201ca good portion of the press abdicated its real duty\u201d by not investigating the hackers. Clooney also turned his anger against the film industry: \u201cAs we watched one group be completely vilified, nobody stood up. Nobody took that stand. Nobody wanted to be the first to sign on. Now, this isn\u2019t finger-pointing on that. This is just where we are right now, how scared this industry has been made.\u201d You can read more about Clooney\u2019s comments here. How did the FBI peg North Korea as the principal actors in the Sony hack? A digital \u201cfingerprint\u201d likely gave them away, a cybersecurity specialist told my colleagues Dominic Rushe (@dominicru) and Oliver Laughland (@oliverlaughland) earlier this week. Eddie Schwartz, president of White Ops, said investigators will begin by looking at the malware, the software used by the hackers and then look at the next moves they made. \u201cDifferent groups have different patterns of activity that they take on once they enter a system. Those patterns are like a fingerprint, almost like a playbook. You\u2019ll see that they go after certain servers first, that they conduct operations in a certain way.\u201d He said there was only a \u201csmall universe of teams\u201d capable of pulling off a hack as large as this. Schwartz said North Korea was capable of pulling off the Sony hack, but that in past cases third parties had been shown to be responsible, and it was unclear who had commissioned them. The Sony hack was \u201can attack on our freedom of expression and way of life\u201d, Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson has said in a statement. The cyber attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment was not just an attack against a company and its employees. It was also an attack on our freedom of expression and way of life. This event underscores the importance of good cybersecurity practices to rapidly detect cyber intrusions and promote resilience throughout all of our networks. Every CEO should take this opportunity to assess their company\u2019s cybersecurity. Every business in this country should seek to employ best practices in cybersecurity. The Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies are here to help. We seek to raise the level of cybersecurity in both the private sector and civilian government, and provide timely information to protect all our systems against cyber threats. Johnson goes on to pitch DHS\u2019s Cybersecurity Framework to businesses to better protect themselves. North Korea\u2019s annual GDP per capita is just $1,800, per CIA estimates and a Reuters report about just how difficult it will be to respond to the cyberattack. Pyongyang has been sanctioned in various forms by the United States for more than 50 years and has become expert in hiding its often criminal money-raising activities, largely avoiding traditional banks. While sanctions may have slowed its nuclear weapons program, they have not derailed it. One possible response would be to pressure private companies that provide North Korea\u2019s cellular and television services, or to persuade China to close Internet connections, something Beijing, the North\u2019s sole major ally, has been loath to do. Egypt\u2019s Orascom and Thai company Loxley Pacific are both invested in the North\u2019s telecommunications industry. \u201cIn concrete terms, there\u2019s not a heck of a lot they can do because one, North Korea doesn\u2019t have an economy, and two, we\u2019ve already got every sanction known to man against them,\u201d said Jim Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who focuses on cybersecurity. Senator John McCain has called the cyberattack \u201can act of war\u201d, CNN reports, quoting McCain\u2019s comments to an Arizona radio station. \u201cThis is the greatest blow to free speech that I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime probably. We have to respond in kind. We have lots of capability in cyber and we ought to start cranking that up.\u201d \u201cCyber security is the least understood, most dangerous element of our national security today.\u201d McCain also said Sony should \u201csuck it up, show the movie\u201d. As the next chair of the Senate armed services committee, McCain said he plans to hold a cybersecurity hearing in the coming weeks. With the official accusation now public, all eyes turn to President Obama, who is scheduled to speak with the press at 1.30pm. Obama will almost certainly face questions about what the US can do, considering North Korea is already subject to sanctions and has been economically isolated for decades. The US\u2019s complicated relationship with China could also be an obstacle to retaliation, since the latter is North Korea\u2019s primary source of goods. China and the US have traded sharp accusations about cyber espionage in recent years as well. The FBI has released its update on the Sony investigation, which reads in part: \u201cThe FBI now has enough information to conclude that the North Korean government is responsible for these actions. While the need to protect sensitive sources and methods precludes us from sharing [all the details of its evidence], our conclusion is based, in part, on the following: \u201cTechnical analysis of the data deletion malware used in this attack revealed links to other malware that the FBI knows North Korean actors previously developed. For example, there were similarities in specific lines of code, encryption algorithms, data deletion methods and compromised networks. \u201cThe FBI also observed significant overlap between the infrastructure of this attack and other malicious cyber activity the US government has previously linked directly to North Korea. For example, the FBI discovered that several internet protocol (IP) addresses associated with known North Korean infrastructure with IP addresses that were hardcoded into the data deletion malware used in this attack. \u201cSeparately the tools used in the SPE [Sony Pictures] attack have similarities to a cyber attack in March of last year against South Korean banks and media outlets, which was carried out by North Korea. \u201cWe are deeply concerned about the destructive nature of this attack on a private sector entity and the ordinary citizens who worked there. Further, North Korea\u2019s attack on SPE reaffirms that cyber threats pose one of the gravest national security dangers to the United States. Though the FBI has seen a wide variety and increasing number of cyber intrusions, the destructive nature of this attack, coupled with its coercive nature sets it apart. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s actions were intended to inflict significant harm on a US business and suppress the right of American citizens to express themselves. Such acts of intimidation fall outside the bounds of acceptable state behavior. The FBI takes seriously any attempt \u2013 whether through cyber-enabled means, threats of violence, or otherwise \u2013 to undermine the social prosperity of our citizens. \u201cThe FBI stands ready to assist any US company that is the victim of a destructive cyber attack or breach of confidential business information. Further, the FBI will continue to work closely with multiple departments and agencies as well as with domestic, foreign, and private sector partners who have played a critical role in our ability to trace this and other cyber threats to their source. Working together, the FBI will identify, pursue, and impose costs and consequences on individuals, groups, or nation states who use cyber means to threaten the United States or US interests.\u201d You can read the full statement here. \u201cThe US should provide evidence to China,\u201d a spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry has told reporters about the Sony hack. The Guardian\u2019s Jonathan Kaiman (@JRKaiman) reports from Beijing: Responding to questions about China\u2019s role in the incident, foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said in a press conference that China is also the victim of hacking, and the Chinese government is committed to combatting cyber crime. \u201cWe do not understand the full situation, but countries should work together to solve this problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the US has more evidence concerning this incident, it should provide [that evidence] to China.\u201d The state newswire Xinhua has been intermittently reporting on the incident \u2013 on Friday night, a headline read that the White House considered the breach a national security incident; the story did not mention China\u2019s relationship with North Korea or its possible role in the hack. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Obama administration\u2019s response to the hack on Sony Pictures, which anonymous officials have strongly suggested has links to North Korea. President Obama will hold a news conference at 1.30pm ET, and is expected to comment on the US response and Sony\u2019s decision to cancel the film after hackers released thousands of internal emails and threatened terrorist attacks on theaters. Obama is expected to speak on a wide variety of other topics as well. Reuters reports that the FBI will release an update on what it knows about the cyberattack, and whether its investigators have found a definitive link to North Korean or Chinese involvement. An FBI spokeswoman told the Guardian they could not confirm those reports. On Thursday, Sony decided to cancel the Christmas release of its comedy The Interview, which mocks North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. In a statement released to CNN on Friday the hackers purportedly praised the company for acceding to their demands, writing \u201cIt\u2019s very wise that you have made a decision to cancel the release of \u2018The Interview.\u2019 \u201cWe ensure the security of your data unless you make additional trouble.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
