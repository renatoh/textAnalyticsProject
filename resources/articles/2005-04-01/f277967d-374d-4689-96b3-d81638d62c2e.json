You just get such a buzz from being out with the others in your colours - it's like a drug, but legal! Just walking down the street together makes you feel all euphoric and proud. You get such a terrific reaction from passers-by as well: everybody seems to like to see us and we enjoy basking in the admiration (as we like to think of it) of our public. The whole point of RHS is that it is totally frivolous - we don't set out to educate ourselves or change society or raise money for good causes - although many of us do that elsewhere. I became involved after seeing RHS stuff in the shops when I was on holiday in the US last autumn. You can sell a Red Hatter anything in purple and red. When a friend announced her intention of \"growing old disgracefully\" I was inspired to investigate further, so I looked on the society's website and set my heart on a purple feather boa with flashing red lights. Once I got one, I needed somewhere to wear it to ... The RHS is aimed at the kind of woman whose children are still wincing and hissing \"Mu-um!\", even into their 20s and 30s. There's an ethos of being wildly camped up and dressing outrageously. We wear glittery nail varnish, temporary tattoos, purple fishnet tights and spray our hair purple if we can find a spray that doesn't say \"not for grey hair\". We roam the streets in gangs, giggling and terrorising young men. We go on the swings in parks, walk along the top of little walls and run up downward escalators. We blow bubbles, play kazoos and flirt with public officials. You know how people say \"50 is the new 40\"? Well, we say, \"50 is the new eight\". Middle-aged women are supposed to be invisible, safe, dependable and the bedrock of civilisation: Red Hatters are saying, 'Sod that - somebody else can do it.'\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
