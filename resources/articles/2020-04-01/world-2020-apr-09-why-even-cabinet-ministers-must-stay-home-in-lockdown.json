Government ministers including Robert Jenrick have taken to the airwaves every day for weeks to urge the public to #StayHomeSaveLives, as the communities secretary put it in a tweet on Wednesday. However, Jenrick travelled to visit his parents at the weekend, 40 miles from his own home, reportedly to drop off food and medicines. But that explanation is bound to come under scrutiny \u2013 given his own public utterances, which have included repeated pleas for people to turn to local communities to provide this kind of support. The disclosure also comes just days after Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, was asked to resign after it was revealed this week that she had twice visited her holiday home in Earlsferry, Fife, and even visited the local beach during the lockdown. Calderwood, who had been the public face of the \u201cstay at home\u201d mantra in Scotland, apologised for the breach before being asked to resign by the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. The government\u2019s instructions could not be clearer: \u201cOnly go outside for food, health reasons or work (but only if you cannot work from home); if you go out, stay 2 metres away from other people at all times; wash your hands as soon as you get home.\u201d Crucially, they add: \u201cDo not meet others, even friends or family. You can spread the virus even if you don\u2019t have symptoms.\u201d Regarding relatives, the instructions say: \u201cYou should not be visiting family members who do not live in your home. You should keep in touch with them using phone or video calls.\u201d The document adds that if they are elderly or vulnerable \u201cyou may leave your house to help them, for example, by dropping shopping or medication at their door\u201d. It is understood that Jenrick\u2019s parents have had support locally. The lockdown was introduced to stop the spread of the disease. It is designed to shield those who are most vulnerable, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. Even if someone is not displaying symptoms, such as a dry cough or a high temperature, they may still be carrying the potentially fatal virus without knowing it. Senior police officers have reinforced the warnings. Nottinghamshire police, whose patch covers Jenrick\u2019s Newark constituency, said earlier this week: \u201cWe all need to contribute to the national effort to respond to the coronavirus outbreak and reduce the spread of the disease. People need to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
