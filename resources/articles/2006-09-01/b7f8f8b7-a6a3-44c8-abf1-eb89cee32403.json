Thankfully Cole's problems with his head appear to be insufficiently serious to keep him out of today's game against Andorra. Sadly, examples of a player's head \"not being right\" are increasingly common. As with most injuries, this is often caused by using the injured muscle in sudden and unusual ways. The footballer's head is a simple organ. In this case the suspicion is that large amounts of unaccustomed head-related activity during transfer discussions - including thinking, pondering and ruminating - have left his head in a condition completely unsuited to professional football. The internal brain muscle may have become dangerously overextended. After one particularly tough thinking session Cole is said to have complained of headaches, the ability to speak French, a desire to attempt a crossword puzzle and a creeping sense of the essential futility of his own existence. Current treatments for excessive off-field thinking are fairly straightforward. A few hundred hours spent sitting on a couch listening to smooth R'n'B flavas on a diamond-encrusted iPod should go some way towards righting the problem. More advanced cures include buying a watch so expensive it has its own democratically elected government, crashing your Lincoln Navigator into a parking meter while drinking Cristal and Red Bull from your glamour-model girlfriend's sapphire-encrusted Nike training shoe, and golf. Even more worrying is the suggestion that Cole's head is quite literally \"not right\", having been transformed into an inappropriate shape, such as a rhomboid or dodecahedron, during his brief pre-season break. There is a certain logic to this theory. After months of promising gestation, Cole's move to Chelsea evolved into the football equivalent of a difficult birth. Having failed to land the player using traditional methods, Chelsea's agents may have resorted to more drastic means. The club's chief executive Peter Kenyon has spoken privately of plans to employ both the metal birthing forceps and the suction-cup ventouse while trying to coach a particularly reluctant signing out of an exclusive Knightsbridge hotel suite and into his club Mercedes. It is possible that the presence of these instruments at the negotiating table during Cole's \"birth\" as a Chelsea player may have left unsightly welts or bruising. In this case medical experts would agree on a brief early-season layoff to allow for underwater yoga sessions, massage with extra virgin olive oil and many long hours spent lying in a tiny bed yelling his head off while Steve Clarke tries to remember the words to Miss Molly Had A Dolly. Either way, the parlous state of Cole's head will surely be cause for public sympathy at Old Trafford today. English football needs Cole's head back in its original shape and form as quickly as possible. Except, perhaps, if we could just do something about that beard."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
