True to form, Ineos are very much on it, on and off the road, while Romain Bardet\u2019s AG2R team ride like they\u2019ve just stumbled out into the afternoon sunshine after a long and boozy Sunday lunch. Instead of Bardet, the French turn their attentions to a resurgent Thibaut Pinot as their big hope, despite his getting lost in some dodgy Brussels backstreets shortly before the stage start. Monday: Binche to \u00c9pernay The Tour leaves Belgium behind for champagne country. As the race drops down to the finish in \u00c9pernay, and Julian Alaphilippe takes a thrilling win, the press buffet flows freely with fizz. Mindful of my professional responsibilities, I abstain until copy has been filed, which leads to a standard French experience as I stride up to the now deserted bar, licking my lips. \u201cD\u00e9sol\u00e9e, monsieur,\u201d the sommelier says coldly. \u201cC\u2019est ferm\u00e9 \u2026\u201d Tuesday: Reims to Nancy Not for the first time, Dave Brailsford is putting a positive spin on things. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t five seconds,\u201d he says of Geraint Thomas\u2019s time loss the day before to his Ineos teammate Egan Bernal. \u201cIt was just a small little gap.\u201d It\u2019s pointed out to him that in fact it does say five seconds in the Tour\u2019s standings. \u201cIt\u2019s just 30 metres,\u201d he insists. After more than a century of racing, Brailsford has created a new parameter of Tour time continuum, of success and failure, of distance over time. Wednesday: St-Di\u00e9 to Colmar The first day in the Vosges fails to produce any major surprises, as Peter Sagan takes his first stage win of the 2019 Tour, a victory he describes as exquisite. That\u2019s more than can be said for tonight\u2019s accommodation, deep in La France Profonde, in a cavernous old-school auberge with far too much blood red to its interior. We eat in a dining room that looks like a set from The Shining and are waited on by a character from Blue Velvet. Thursday: Mulhouse to La Planche The Tour\u2019s first summit stage and every pundit tips Thomas to lose time and Bernal to move further ahead. On the brutal gravelly finish to the \u201cBench of the Beautiful Girls\u201d, the reverse happens and the defending champion makes his point with a powerful acceleration. Bardet meanwhile, loses more time and crosses the line distraught and humiliated. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed,\u201d he says, but the French shrug and move on to Pinot, now the coming man. Friday: Belfort to Chalon The longest day is often the most soporific and that adage holds true as the peloton plods through the 230km trawl through the Doubs and Jura from Belfort to Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne. Dylan Groenewegen\u2019s win proves the highlight of a humdrum day while Tejay van Garderen\u2019s tangle with some road furniture means he rides almost the whole battered, bloodied and broken before he is forced to abandon the Tour. Saturday: M\u00e2con to St-\u00c9tienne You don\u2019t need to have towering climbs to exhaust the peloton as today\u2019s unrelenting ups and downs leading from the Rhone valley into the Massif Central prove. With 3,700 metres of climbing, Thomas crashing and the temperature rising, the wearing-down process before the big climbs of the Pyrenees and Alps continues. It is, as Adam Yates\u2019s sports director at Mitchelton-Scott, Matt White, describes it, a \u201ctough day at the office\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
