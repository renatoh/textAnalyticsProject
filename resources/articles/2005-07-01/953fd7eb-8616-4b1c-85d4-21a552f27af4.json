Kenyon is angry at the way Chelsea's reputation was constantly brought into question last season in high-profile incidents. The tapping-up saga involving Arsenal's Ashley Cole is one of many that he feels should have been handled better. The ill-feeling between the two London clubs shows no sign of abating and Manchester United have also been pointing the finger after Kenyon met Rio Ferdinand, who has yet to sign a new contract at Old Trafford. But Kenyon believes more responsibility lies at Arsenal's and Manchester United's door. \"I'm not confident relations will be better at all with Arsenal,\" he said. \"We won't be going for Ashley Cole this season and if that improves it that's good. I think we are not going to be sniped at either. We compete on the field and that is an important step. \"We don't comment on other clubs but we are not just going to sit back and take it. I think it's born out of hypocrisy and insecurity. There have been two kids on the block for 12 years and now there is a third kid and he looks like being more successful than the other two.\" Kenyon joined Chelsea on their US tour on Friday but is flying back today to complete the signing of the Lyon midfielder Michael Essien. The French club have demanded as much as \u00a332m for the Ghanaian but Kenyon is adamant Chelsea will not be held to ransom. \"The negotiations are ongoing,\" he said. \"They have stalled while Lyon have been playing in the Peace Cup in Korea but they are due back next week and I would expect they will be picked up again. \"In an ideal world we would have had the squad together for this trip, but as long as we have him by August 31 I will be happy. The prices that are being quoted are unrealistic and we certainly don't want to be doing that.\" Jose Mourinho believes he will have failed Chelsea if they do not win the Champions League before his contract runs out in 2010. The 42-year-old manager feels unfulfilled after Chelsea's semi-final defeat by Liverpool in May. \"It is part of our project for the next five years to repeat successes we did before and win what we didn't, so the Champions League is part of that project,\" he said. \"I would consider it a failure if Chelsea haven't won the Champions League in those five years.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
