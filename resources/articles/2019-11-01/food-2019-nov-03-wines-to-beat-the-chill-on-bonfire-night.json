Of course, the wines I\u2019ll be looking for on Tuesday are nothing like the sunlit bottles of July. I\u2019m after something that gives the impression of being warming \u2013 no matter how illusory the effect may be. It has to be pretty robust as well, since I\u2019m not going to be drinking it in the sort of conditions (or from the type of vessel) where I\u2019ll be able to appreciate any subtle aromas. It would be nice if it were cheap, too, for the same reasons. Feed all that into the wine-style generator and the first option fed back on the ticker tape is Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s southern Italian red, with its tangy cherry and dark plummy fruitiness. Aldi Vinsobres, Rh\u00f4ne, France 2018 (\u00a36.99, Aldi) The south of France is the home of what I think of as the classic Bonfire Night wine. From the Rh\u00f4ne in the west, and on east through the Languedoc to the Roussillon, winemakers here specialise in powerful reds each with their own character but almost always on a theme of brambly fruit, spice, smoke and herb \u2013 wines that are very happy to be drunk from a mug held in one fingerless-gloved hand, with a sausage sandwich or a flask of spicy bean soup in the other. Some recent favourites: the darkly savoury, black cherry juicy Alain Gringon Carignan Vielles Vignes, PGI Pays de l\u2019H\u00e9rault 2018 (\u00a37.99, Majestic); the bright blackberry juiciness and peppery hit of Waitrose &amp; Partners Marselan, Mediterran\u00e9e 2017 (\u00a36.99, Waitrose); and the always reliable, super-succculent, spiced dark berries of Famille Perrin La Vieille Ferme Rouge, Vin de France 2018 (from \u00a37.50, Tesco; The Co-op). Morrisons The Best South Africa Shiraz, Western Cape, South Africa 2017 (\u00a37.25, Morrisons) Other good sources of honest-to-goodness bonfire-side spiciness include south east Spain, where the monastrell variety (known as mourv\u00e8dre in the south of France) does its big bold dark plummy thing with flashes of smoke, spice and just a touch of sweet autumnal chestnuttiness in a pair of bargains: Organic Carta Roja Pura Monastrell 2018 from Jumilla (\u00a37.75, Morrisons) and Tapa Roja Old Vines Monastrell 2018 from Yecla (\u00a37, Marks &amp; Spencer). The boldness of Shiraz, again served with a hint of smoke, is in full effect in Morrisons\u2019 South African bargain and, with freshly milled pepper and crunchy fruit, in Sainsbury\u2019s excellent Taste the Difference Western Australian Shiraz 2018 (\u00a36.75). And for those with a sweeter tooth, or requiring more fortification to ward off the chill, Morrisons Ruby Port NV (\u00a37.15), made by the Symington Family, is brilliant value: a sweet, simple but succulent dark fruit compote.
