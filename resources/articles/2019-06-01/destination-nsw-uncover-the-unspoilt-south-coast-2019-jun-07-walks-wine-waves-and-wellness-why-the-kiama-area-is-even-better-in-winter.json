Just ask our local insiders: Bruce Ferguson of the Little Blowhole Art Bar, Fiona Walmsley of Buena Vista Farm, and Andrew Prosser of Stoic Brewing. 1. Kiama Coast Walk There\u2019s no more spectacular introduction to this region than the Kiama Coast Walk, a 22km shore-hugging pathway taking in one of the most beautiful stretches of the Australian coast, from the Minnamurra River south to Gerringong. Good walkers can tackle it in a day. But you don\u2019t have to trek the whole walk to enjoy its beauty; there are plenty of manageable shorter options, too. Kiama to Gerringong is 6km and you can get the train back, or simply walk from the Kiama Blowhole to the Little Blowhole. If you have children in tow, break it up over a weekend so you can stop and watch the blowholes, read the markers with notes on local history and geology, and spend time at the whale watching platform on the southern headland at Werri Beach, Gerringong. Currents bring the whales close to shore here and sightings are likely from May to November. 2. Little Blowhole Art Bar &amp; Gallery The Kiama Blowhole gets all the PR but the Little Blowhole is more active. From the ridgetop vantage point of the Little Blowhole Art Bar you can indulge in tasty tapas dishes and sample a delicious local wine. Owners Bruce Ferguson and Jamie Cole\u2019s buzzing restaurant takes full advantage of the ever-changing sea views and lush hinterland scenes to the west. The scene indoors changes too, with a new exhibition each month and local musicians moving through. Make sure you book ahead to catch up-and-coming jazz performers from the Wollongong Conservatorium of Music, first Sunday of the month. Little Blowhole Art Bar is perched on the top of a hill in the back streets of Kiama. 3. Picnic at Boneyard Beachgoers are spoilt for choice in Kiama, which has five to choose from. Surf and East beaches are the most child-friendly, says the Art Bar\u2019s Bruce Ferguson. Pack some lunch and head for Boneyard Beach (near Cathedral Rocks) at Kiama Downs on the northern side of the Bombo Headland. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrific grassy picnic spot, dog-friendly too,\u201d Ferguson says. \u201cThere\u2019s no surf or swell so you can snorkel or paddleboard and see the marine life.\u201d 4. Art workshop Spice up a short or long break with a creative activity. In her weekend workshops, Kiama mixed media artist Sharon Blair provides a supportive and fun environment in which people can experiment and build creative confidence. Hand making flower stencils, mono printing with a gelli plate, drawing buds and blooms and colour education are all steps towards you going home with an original creation. Winter workshop dates are July 26-27 and August 3-4. 5. Yoga, meditation and spas Stretch and relax at Emergence Yoga Kiama. Situated in the heart of Kiama, it offers yoga, meditation, adult ballet, pilates and tai chi, and often hosts workshops and retreats. Book into a class or stock up on local yoga products and Doterra essential oils. Some other mindful options: Ferguson runs broyoga classes just for men (check Facebook), and Ali Dear and Karen Emerson of Samayastudio run outdoor classes (choose from slow flow, flow, vinyasa, meditation, or yin). Endota Spa in Kiama and Bella Spa at Gerringong are terrific pampering stops. 6. Tune into festivals The Kiama region is a big drawcard for music acts and you can be guaranteed of entertainment on any long weekend and many other weekends in between. Country comes to the coast on the June long weekend with the KLC festival - Kiama Loves Country. Nearby, Crooked River Winery\u2019s 21st Winter Wine Festival is on the same weekend, with great food, more music, top wines and craft beer on the menu. There\u2019s a Blues Bash at the Kiama Bowling &amp; Recreation Club on 22 June, and the inland hamlet of Jamberoo holds a Music Festival on 20 July. Ferguson recommends dropping into Kiama\u2019s Hindmarsh Park on the first Sunday of the month to catch a free Music in the Park performance. 7. Buena Vista Farm visit Set on seven and a bit hectares overlooking the sea at Gerringong, Buena Vista Farm is a slice of a larger property held by the same family for 150 years. Fiona Walmsley is the fourth generation to farm this bucolic patch and, with her husband Adam, has built up a thriving organic enterprise and teaching centre. Take a cooking from scratch, sourdough baking or fermenting class and enjoy the full farm tour: laying hens, meat chickens, dairy goats, dairy and cheese room, coffee grove, Adam\u2019s apiary, kitchen garden, medicinal herb garden and commercial market garden. \u201cIt\u2019s an old farm and very beautiful, Walmsley says. \u201cWe are very lucky.\u201d Buena Vista Farm produce can be found at Kiama Farmers\u2019 Market every Wednesday and on the menu at local restaurants. 8. Cheesemaking class Cheesemaking classes at Buena Vista Farm are hugely popular. \u201cYou\u2019ll make three or four cheeses,\u201d Walmsley says. The sessions start with morning tea then a walk around the farm to meet the goats and see the dairy. Next stop is the commercial kitchen, where ghee and cultured cream and butter are made. Then the cheese room, where goat\u2019s fetta is produced. \u201cThe class runs the gamut between natural cheesemaking in the kitchen with milk kefir, then the sterilised cheese room operation,\u201d Walmsley says. \u201cWe break the day with a two-course paddock-to-plate lunch featuring produce from the farm.\u201d 9. Stoic Brewing Andrew Prosser is a born-and-bred Gerringong boy who, in league with his father, has turned a craft brewing hobby into a hip South Coast stop. Stoic Brewing occupies a smallish Gerringong industrial unit that houses the large vats. \u201cWhere we brew is where you drink and that overwhelms people when they walk in the door - they\u2019re right next to the vats,\u201d says Prosser, who serves beer, cider and local wines. He buys his cider apples from the farmers\u2019 market or handpicks them up in Orange. His brewer\u2019s yeast goes to nearby Buena Vista Farm for bread-making classes. \u201cThey send us handmade cheese and pork in return.\u201d Order an XPA brew (Prosser\u2019s fave), a pale ale or a cider. 10. Clay Coffee Collective Just up the hill in the Gerringong Arcade, Prosser\u2019s mate Matthew Kennedy owns and runs Clay Coffee Collective. With a master\u2019s in chemistry, Kennedy takes his coffee seriously and is winning legions of fans. The coffee, the baked goods and the cups and plates in the cafe - fashioned by artist Brigita Hammel - make for a delightful stop the whole family will love. 11. Minnamurra Rainforest and Falls For an unforgettable nature experience Buena Vista Farm\u2019s Fiona Walmsley sends people bush, on a self-guided walk into the Minnamurra Rainforest in Budderoo National Park. Get some tips from National Parks staff based at the Lyrebird Cafe then set off on elevated walkways through the rare remnant rainforest that once existed throughout the Illawarra. Spectacular waterfalls, birdsong and potential sightings of superb lyrebirds, eastern water dragons and swamp wallabies will keep everyone entertained on the way to the riverside barbecue area. Take a hamper. 12. Rose valley farmstays, luxurious B&amp;Bs and unique holiday homes The Kiama region is best enjoyed while ensconced in its natural beauty, be it on a farm or by the harbour. For a luxurious stay with nostalgic vibes, bed and breakfast Terragong 1858 offers old school charm in a lovingly refurbished Colonial Georgian home. Off the beaten track but only 10 minutes\u2019 drive from Werri Beach and Gerringong, you can enjoy a family-friendly farm stay at Schottlanders Wagyu Farmstay in picturesque Rose Valley. Also worth a look are the Sebel Kiama for harbour views and easy stroll to the blowholes, and boutique home stays such as Soul of Gerringong, Kelly Cottage at Jerrara, The Shed at Gerroa, and luxury accommodation for eight at Dovecote, overlooking Werri Beach.
