Top stories In the shadow of a cabinet reshuffle yesterday, the government released a long-anticipated review of its climate policies which foreshadows loosening the current safeguard mechanism for pollution levels. Labor and the Greens blasted the new annual emissions projections, which predict Australia will increase its emissions all the way to 2030 and beyond, and called the Coalition\u2019s action on climate change woefully inadequate. \u201cWhen you look at those numbers you really do start to understand why [the government] would sneak them out, because they are a shocking set of numbers,\u201d the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said. Butler also condemned the permissive signal on the safeguards mechanism in the review, as did the Greens\u2019 climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, who noted the government wanted to weaken its \u201cflawed\u201d emissions reduction fund by allowing companies\u2019 pollution baselines to be increased. \u201cThe data is devastating and the policy review is a travesty,\u201d Bandt said. \u201cPollution is going up, we won\u2019t meet even our paltry Paris targets and the government\u2019s only plan is to make matters worse by allowing companies to buy dodgy permits from pig farms in China instead of cutting Australia\u2019s emissions.\u201d Bill Shorten is facing some stormy weather at home in Melbourne \u2013 not yesterday\u2019s thunder and lightning, but a factional fight that has plunged his own branch into turmoil. The brawl is compounding internal difficulties for the opposition leader after the ALP\u2019s loss in last weekend\u2019s Bennelong byelection. A breakaway group of right- and leftwingers want to overturn a stability pact, agreed between the former rightwing parliamentary powerbroker Stephen Conroy and the veteran leftwinger Kim Carr, which has maintained factional harmony in the Victorian branch for several years. A number of Victorian Labor sources have expressed dismay at the outbreak of factional jostling, one characterising the recent developments as \u201cpure madness\u201d. An ex-chief of MI6 has warned that Brexit will cause a loss of British global influence not seen since the 1970s. Sir John Sawers has told British MPs they will need to figure out how to rebuild the country\u2019s economy and international standing after leaving the EU. Calling for an urgent reprioritisation of resources post-Brexit, Sawers said: \u201cWe have to recognise a pretty stark reality faces us at the end of this process, and we have to rebuild from that.\u201d Accused of doom and gloom by the Conservative MP Nusrat Ghani, Sawers bit back. \u201cWe have to acknowledge that Brexit is damaging our economy at the moment. Immediately after Brexit we suffered a 15% devaluation in our currency.\u201d Sawers, a former UK ambassador to the UN, said the distraction of Brexit may have contributed to Britain failing to win a seat for the British candidate on the international court of justice. Theresa May had not been able to play the same international role in the world as the French president had in the past six months. \u201cThat is just a reality,\u201d he said. A Queensland farmer has been fined and ordered to restore native vegetation he cleared on his property, despite a significant media campaign claiming the farmer had done nothing wrong. After initial stories in the Guardian and the ABC last month reported allegations that the owners of Wombinoo, south-west of Cairns, had illegally cleared 60 hectares of native trees, there was a furore as the owners, a farmer lobby group and federal MPs lined up to reject the claim. However, the Queensland government has announced it had found the landholders had engaged in the unauthorised clearing of untouched vegetation. It said while the landholder had a clearing permit in place, approximately 132 hectares were cleared outside the approved area. Justice Peter McClellan, who chaired Australia\u2019s landmark royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, will retire in February. But the ceremony, in Sydney\u2019s supreme court, will not be a standard judge-of-appeal farewell. There will be a \u201cbusload\u201d of grateful child sexual abuse survivors to pay tribute to the man who oversaw the five-year inquiry, sensitively interviewing victims and survivors and their families, cross-examining CEOs, archbishops and rabbis and finally making more than 400 recommendations to keep children safer in future. \u201cWe are attending to show Peter McClellan\u2019s family how much we valued him as chair of the commission, but also as a message to the nation,\u201d says Leonie Sheedy, the CEO of Care Leavers\u2019 Australasia Network told Guardian Australia. \u201cHe worked hard to get our trust and we respect his leadership, his commitment to the royal commission, and the way he led an amazing team of people.\u201d Sport The underperforming English cricket team is facing a backlash post-Ashes, with senior team members felt to have let down the side. While younger talents such as Dawid Malan, Craig Overton and James Vince have surprised fans with their performances, where was the experience and steady hand at the top, asks Andy Bull. The Guardian counts down the top 100 best footballers in the world this year \u2013 today, 100-71, featuring Marcus Rashford, Samuel Umtiti and Keylor Navas. Thinking time The recent case of Ms Norton has highlighted the \u201cfinancial abuse\u201d the family courts can inflict on litigants. The \u201ceye-watering\u201d charges of $860,000 accrued in the accrimonious dispute prompted the presiding judge to refer lawyers to the legal services commission. Justice Robert Benjamin noted the large volume of correspondence between solicitors that were attached to the affidavits. \u201cSome of those letters were inflammatory and reflected the anger of the parties or one or other of them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe letters were at times accusatory. They were often verbose and at times involved unnecessary tit-for-tat commentary ... solicitors are not employed to act as \u2018postman\u2019 to vent the anger and vitriol of their clients.\u201d The law reform commission has launched a review into the family court system and aims to promote earlier and more cost-effective resolutions in family disputes. But Ms Norton is not optimistic. \u201cThe problem is the culture of the court,\u201d she says. \u201cThe system is \u2026 profoundly worrying.\u201d Donald Trump has sat for 20 interviews with cable news channel Fox, and regularly live-tweets its programs, frequently claiming they are one of the few media sources that don\u2019t produce \u201cfake news\u201d. Fox has returned the favour by covering the Russia investigation in a positive light for the president, and is a primary source of information for Republican supporters. The question is, asks Washington correspondent Ben Jacobs, whether Fox\u2019s ardent defence of the president will have a political impact as the net draws tighter around the president\u2019s closest advisers in the Russia investigation. What, if anything, can Fox news do then? The Guardian has named The Handmaid\u2019s Tale the best TV show of 2017. \u201cThe near-future horror of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale arrived on our televisions with a precise timeliness that could be painful to witness,\u201d writes Rebecca Nicholson of Netflix\u2019s production of Margaret Atwood\u2019s novel. \u201cWhile it reflected the cultural and political conversations going on around it with a sometimes eerie prescience, ultimately this was a show about power, piety and corruption, and what happens under any ultra-conservative regime. A large part of the reason it felt so close is not necessarily what\u2019s happening in the US right now, but what\u2019s happening on the news every night, all around the world.\u201d Check out the full pick of top 50 shows here. What\u2019s he done now? Donald Trump has once again accused the Washington Post of printing \u201cfake news\u201d, saying its source for an article on him talking about rescinding Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to the supreme court \u201cdoesn\u2019t exist\u201d. \u201cA story in the @washingtonpost that I was close to \u201crescinding\u201d the nomination of Justice Gorsuch prior to confirmation is FAKE NEWS. I never even wavered and am very proud of him and the job he is doing as a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The unnamed sources don\u2019t exist!\u201d Trump tweeted in response. Media roundup The Herald Sun splashes with a very large and very concerned headline: \u201cBooze price sting\u201d, revealing Aussie drinkers could face paying more for their tipples under a \u201cradical\u201d healthcare plan. A slab of Victoria Bitter, which currently costs about $47, would jump to over $50 under the draft plan, the paper says. The Australian reports that Malcolm Turnbull has sparked a fresh round of infighting within his party by promoting conservative and regional MPs to the frontbench in a sweeping ministerial reshuffle. And the ABC science team has pulled together a handy guide for hitting the beach safely this summer, including how to treat a jellyfish sting, how to identify and avoid rip currents and how to minimise your risk of being attacked by a shark. Coming up A special report on Victoria\u2019s independent broad-based anti-corruption commission\u2019s first five years will be tabled in parliament, marking the end of Stephen O\u2019Bryan\u2019s term as commissioner. Western Australia\u2019s treasurer, Ben Wyatt, will announce the state\u2019s mid-year budget review, which is expected to show a deficit increase from September budget estimates. Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Zendaya, Keala Settle and Australian director Michael Gracey will be in Sydney for the Australian premiere of a new film about PT Barnum called The Greatest Showman.
