After singing to himself on the way to the door, he was heard saying \u201cright\u201d and removing the microphone that had recorded his private moment. Some speculated that it sounded like the start of the West Wing theme, while ITV\u2019s political editor, Robert Peston, suggested that it was a Winnie the Pooh-style ditty. Classic FM, a British radio station, analysed the notes and declared they were \u201cBeethoven-esque\u201d. Some on Twitter saw Cameron\u2019s relaxed demeanour as a sign he was pleased to be leaving Downing Street amid the chaos of the Brexit vote aftermath."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
