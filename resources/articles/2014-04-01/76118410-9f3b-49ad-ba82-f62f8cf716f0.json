The Danish restaurant, known for what the award organisers said was \"meticulous attention to detail, innovative approach to foraging and experimentation with fermentation\", has been restored to the top spot after being ousted last year by Spain's El Celler de Can Roca following three consecutive Noma wins in 2010, 2011 and 2012. \"We didn't expect it at all, we thought we had had our moment on this list. I know that for the team, this is the biggest moment,\" said Rene Redzepi, chef-owner of Noma. \"We came in here expecting nothing. The newspapers said Noma is over. We have a moment that is mind-boggling.\" The list is considered by some as one of the highlights of the global gastronomic calendar, and has emerged as an upstart rival to the Michelin rankings. There was cause for celebration for British foodies of a patriotic bent after Heston Blumenthal's Dinner restaurant climbed two places to occupy the number five spot and another London restaurant, The Ledbury, climbed three places to number ten. For Blumenthal, the result from last night's annual ceremony in the Guildhall, London delivers publicity of a much better kind than the outbreak of a vomiting virus which earlier this year caused him to close the two Michelin-starred Knightsbridge eatery after 24 diners and 21 members of staff were taken ill. There were seven American restaurants in the Top 50, one less than last year, meaning that the USA matched Spain and France as the countries with the highest number of entries on the list, published by Restaurant magazine. Eleven Madison Park in New York moved up one spot to number four and claimed the best restaurant in North America award. Three Spanish restaurants are in the top 10, which includes the two Basque culinary powerhouses, Mugaritz and its fellow San Sebasti\u00e1n establishment, Arzak. Basque gastronomy also continued to advance with a new entry Azurmendi from Larrabetzu, near Bilbao, debuting at number 26 and picking up the Sustainable Restaurant Award. Italy has three restaurants on the list with Massimo Bottura's Osteria Francescana remaining at number three for the second year running. The highest-ranked restaurant from beyond the shores of the US and Europe was Sao Paulo's DOM, although it dropped one spot to number seven despite what the list described as its \"ambitious, research-led Amazonian cooking\". There was consolation in that chef Alex Atala received the Chef's Choice Award, which is voted by the chefs on the list. Another Brazilian chef, Helena Rizzo, saw her Mani restaurant rise ten places to number 36 while the highest climber award was picked up by to Central in Lima, which made it to number 15 after climbing 35 places. Just seven restaurants from Asia made it into the rankings. They include Nahm in Bangkok, Thailand, which was placed at number 13 and named as the winner of the Best Restaurant in Asia award. Gaggan, also in Bangkok, was ranked at number 17.
