Bend it like Beckham director Gurinder Chadha\u2019s new six-part series tells the story of how India became part of the British empire. \u201cThe most exciting thing is simply having Indians in period costumes on primetime British TV \u2013 where their lives and loves are as important as their white counterparts. That\u2019s a flipping radical thing,\u201d she told Radio Times. She hopes the series will be educational as well as entertaining \u2013 in a country where, Chadha says, schools are \u201cfrightened of telling the truth\u201d about colonialism. \u201cMost children in British schools aren\u2019t even told now that there was an empire, that the British ruled India,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cOf course it\u2019s wrong.\u201d Chadha has made her career adapting English classics through a modern lens. In Bride and Prejudice, her 2004 adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s classic, she injected a Bollywood twist, adding a multicultural layer to a story that speaks to the complexities of family expectations. Her work has been heralded as a breath of fresh air in a screen landscape that often leaves minority ethnic audiences in Britain and Hollywood feeling alienated. But Chadha says multicultural casting comes easy to her because her teams are diverse from the inside out. \u201cMy buzz-phrase is \u2018effortlessly diverse\u2019. That\u2019s what I do. My teams, both in front of and behind the camera, are a complete mixture. Diversity, for me, is a state of mind: it\u2019s about how you see the world. \u201cBecause I grew up in a very Indian household in a very English environment, I can jump both sides. That\u2019s what my work is about,\u201d she said. Beecham House, which starts on 23 June, tells the story of John Beecham, played by Tom Bateman, who arrives in India in 1795 as a former employee of the East India Company \u2013 an institution that politically and commercially dominated India during British colonial rule. \u201cIt\u2019s an adventure and a love story. But \u2013 hopefully \u2013 if you\u2019re open to it, a story about today. Because John is an immigrant, looking for a better life. And it\u2019s about nationhood, so it has obvious connections with now,\u201d said Chadha. Chadha, who is used to making films for the big screen, spoke of the luxury \u2013 and challenges \u2013 of working on a six-part series. \u201cIf I want to change one thing, it\u2019s like: \u2018How will that affect that bloody scene in episode six?\u2019 So it\u2019s like six times more what you would do in a movie,\u201d she said. As David Beckham\u2019s retirement spawned a rash of headines such as \u201cEnd it like Beckham\u201d, Chadha spoke of her pride that the title still resonates after 17 years. \u201cAbsolutely [I feel proud]. At having put that phrase into the vernacular. When he was done for driving too fast, it was \u2018Speed it like Beckham\u2019. When he does a lot of shopping, it\u2019s \u2018Spend it like Beckham\u2019. I find it quite thrilling.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
