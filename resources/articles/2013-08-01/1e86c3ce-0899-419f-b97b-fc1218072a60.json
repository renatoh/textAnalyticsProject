Nick Hurd, minister for civil society, made the comments in the wake of recent figures showing that 1.09 million 16 to 24-year-olds are classified as not in education, employment or training (Neet). \"What we see in survey after survey is employers saying qualifications are important, but that just as important to us are so-called soft skills, character skills, the ability to get on with different people, to articulate yourself clearly, confidence, grit, self-control, these kind of qualifications and they are saying we are not seeing enough of them in kids coming out of schools,\" said the minister, according to a report in the Daily Mail. \"Something's gone wrong, this is a critical time in their lives to be stretching and challenging them and make them feel engaged.\" However, there was outrage among many at Hurd's comments, with Twitter focusing that anger. Some took aim at Hurd's own background as the Old Etonian son of the former Cabinet minister, Douglas Hurd, and a member of the Bullingdon Club while at Oxford University. \"'Young lack the grit to get jobs', says minister (4th generation MP, son of a cabinet minister, Eton, Oxford, etc),\" tweeted Matt Cavanagh, an associate fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) thinktank and a former special adviser for the Labour government between 2003 and 2010. Mitch Benn, a comic and songwriter, tweeted: \"If you don't have the grit or gumption to be born into a rich &amp; important family, you've no one to blame but yourself.\" Another Twitter user said: \"young people don't have the grit to find jobs? \u2026 maybe if you gave us some more opportunities we might be able to!\" The figure of 1.09m young people classified as Neet from the Office for National Statistics was for the period January to March of this year. It was up 21,000 from October to December 2012 but down 101,000 from a year earlier. The statistics were accompanied by others showing that just over half (53%) were classified as unemployed. Hurd described the figure as a \"horrible number\" that had been high for too long, and spoke of \"crushingly low\" self-confidence of many young people and the impact this had on their job prospects. \"Social skills and discipline are every bit as essential for success as qualifcations \u2013 yet they are not being taught in schools,\" he added. Ministers last week seized on news of a sharper than expected decline in the number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance in July as fresh evidence that the economy is on the mend. But youth unemployment, which remains stubbornly high, rose slightly, by 15,000 over the three months to June, according to the ONS said. There are now 973,000 16-to-24-year-olds out of work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
