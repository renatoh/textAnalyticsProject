One which consists of muzzling the media, by simply cutting its livelihood and appointing its managers. Nicolas Sarkozy announced in January 2008 that he wished to ban prime-time advertising on public television. Nobody saw it coming, not even the media and culture minister, Christine Albanel, who hadn't been briefed. Apparently, the French president had had the idea only the day before, after a conversation with his son's godfather, Martin Bouygues, the head of TF1, the first private TV channel in France. Although it was then only a presidential idea, one of many, the result was immediate: the two main public channels saw their advertising revenues plummet. The market, it seems, was already anticipating the effects of a law which should be passed by decree in a few days' time and applied from January 5. By decree? The opposition, or what's left of it, is indeed battling fiercely against the bill at the national assembly and its virulence might delay the parliamentary proceedings beyond the January date chosen by the president. With a renewed energy, and in an effort to show a united front, Socialist MPs have showed a sudden and fearless political vigour. They say they will appeal to the constitutional counsel, one of the highest institutional authorities in France. They have also resorted to argue and debate on every aspect of the law in order to slow down the legislation process, an attitude of \"r\u00e9sistance\" which has enraged Nicolas Sarkozy's party, the UMP. Yesterday evening, only 14 out of the 56 articles of the bill had been voted on. It will now be impossible to vote on the entire law by next Tuesday, as originally planned. Yesterday evening, parliamentary debates went on till 1.30am in a very tense atmosphere. This new law regulating the French public broadcast medium proposes among others two new dispositions which have professionals and MPs of the opposition up in arms against it: first of all, the banning of prime-time advertising. Second, the appointment of the different heads of the French public broadcast medium by the president himself. The first one will weaken the financial and political independence of the public networks, the second will in effect give birth to a state controlled public TV and radio. Socialists, Greens and communists denounce what they see as a \"democratic regression\" \u2013 a regression dating back to the late 50s and the Algerian war, a time when the public TV and radio were state controlled by De Gaulle's administration. However, yesterday, article 8 was passed: the heads of the public radio and TV networks will be appointed by the president. The opposition's power sf that of obstruction, nothing more. Sarkozy's party enjoys a strong majority at the assembly. A foreign observer could argue that the new law only puts into words a traditionally French reverence towards the power in place. But to make a bad cultural habit into law dangerous step backwards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
