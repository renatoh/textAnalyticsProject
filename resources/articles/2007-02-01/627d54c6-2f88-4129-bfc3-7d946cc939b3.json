Until now, the UK has restricted its military effort to Helmand province, and the decision to have a broader remit could expose soldiers to greater risk. The defence secretary, Des Browne, last night issued a statement confirming the deployment of extra troops. He said: \"Following a cabinet discussion, the Ministry of Defence is now working on the final details of changes to our force levels ... I will announce our decisions in the proper way, to parliament on Monday. \"The UK has always agreed that Nato needs more forces in these regions ... We have been trying hard to get other nations to live up to the joint commitment Nato made to Afghanistan and provide more forces ... authorised to fight. We will continue to press. But we must be realistic.\" The force will arrive in May and could be deployed across Herat, Nimruz, Kandahar, Ouzgan, Zabol and Daykondi. It will support the Canadians and Danes. Whitehall sources admitted that the additonal deployment had been forced on the British government by the failure of defence ministers at a Nato meeting in Seville on February 7 to get other countries - notably France and Germany - to increase their troop commitment or lift the caveats holding them back from engaging in anything but peacekeeping. Nato is in overall charge of forces in Afghanistan, and the outcome is seen as a test of the organisation's credibility. A Whitehall source said: \"[After] Seville, we faced a choice along with the Americans: do we increase our commitment or accept a potentially worsening situation?\" The use of a mobile force will add to the sense that Nato is having to stretch its forces thinly as it prepares for a new Taliban offensive. Forty-eight British troops have died in Afghanisatan since 2001. Whitehall sources denied that the pressure to act in Afghanistan had precipated the decision to cut the British presence in southern Iraq by 1,600 troops. The cut eases the pressure on the army, but Whitehall insisted the cuts in Iraq were necessary to ensure the Iraqi army started to take control of the country. The cost of the extra deployment is put at \u00a3150m. The alliance already has about 35,000 troops in Afghanistan, including 5,600 British troops, mainly in Helmand. There has been frustration within the alliance that the brunt of the fighting has been borne by troops from just a few countries - notably Britain, Canada and the US. The shadow defence secretary, Liam Fox, rounded on some EU countries saying: \"Those troops should be coming from countries such as Germany, France, Italy and Spain who have so far not shown the adequate resolve to be part of a full Nato complement in Afghanistan. We have now had three reinforcements since the time that John Reid told us we were not going to be under-deployed in Afghanistan. \"It is clear that the government has failed to get our Nato allies to carry their share of the burden in Afghanistan. Too many of our European partners are now pocketing the Nato security guarantee but leaving UK taxpayers and the UK military to carry the cost. \"It is clear now that our army is so over-stretched we can't carry two conflicts. We were told initially that there were no plans to reduce troops in Iraq to reinforce in Afghanistan.\" The Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, Nick Harvey, said: \"Attempts to bolster our efforts in Afghanistan are to be welcomed, but the fact remains that the British army is severely overstretched.There must be clear objectives and clear aims, rather than the confusion that has surrounded much of the mission.\" The deployment came as Britain grounded its Nimrod fleet of aircraft for safety checks. There have been concerns over the safety of the fleet of maritime reconnaissance aircraft since September when one crashed in Afghanistan killing 14 British servicemen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
