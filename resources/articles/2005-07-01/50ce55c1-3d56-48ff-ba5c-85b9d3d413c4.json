In fact it fell by 13 percentage points, a fall equivalent to 29%. In relation to support among other groups, we similarly confused percent with percentage points. We often do. Tory gains at the general election have masked the party's continuing decline, Conservative modernisers warned yesterday. Young, urban, professional and female voters have deserted the party in droves, according to a new report by the reformist Tory pressure group C-Change. Most of the 31 seats the Tories gained in the May election changed hands because Labour voters switched to the Liberal Democrats, not because they embraced the Conservatives, said Nicholas Boles, the director of C-Change. He warned that it would take \"confrontation, tension and conflict\" within the party before it was in fit shape to win again. The Case For Change, published as Tory MPs voted to reclaim the right to select their leader from rank and file members, portrays the party's supporters as well as activists as out of touch with public opinion. In a damning verdict on the \"core vote\" strategy employed repeatedly by Conservative leaders, including Michael Howard, Mr Boles warned that it was those who had abandoned the Tories who would hold the key to Downing Street at the next election - not \"a retired colonel ... or shaven-headed white van driver from Romford\". Launching the report, the former Tory health secretary Stephen Dorrell MP said unless the party reached out to new supporters it could even lose seats. \"We spend far too much of our time focusing on the 32% or 33% who have supported us through thin and thinner. We should be focusing on the extra 10%,\" he said. The report, based on analysis by Andrew Cooper of the Populus polling company, shows that between 1992 and 2005 the party's support among women fell by 13% to 32%; among the AB upper-middle-class voters by 18% to 36%; and among 25- to 45-year-olds by 16% to 26%. While more blue-collar workers support the party, such voters are a decreasing proportion of the electorate. Mr Boles pointed out that former Tory seats which had fallen to Labour, such as Manchester Withington, Cambridge and Birmingham Yardley, are now in Lib Dem hands. The Lib Dems have also seized the second place from the Tories in numerous seats, particularly in northern English cities. Damian Green, a prominent backbencher, called on the party to respond by using liberal, free-market mechanisms to achieve one-nation goals, while the former party chairwoman Theresa May argued that it had to recognise the feminisation of politics to appeal to female voters. Francis Maude, the Tory chairman and founder of C-Change, said the report was \"an absolutely on-the-money diagnosis\". But while C-Change was keen to stress that its supporters could not be pigeonholed, pointing out that they were likely to back different leadership candidates, many in the party argue that the Tories must stand by their traditional message. In a recent speech the shadow home secretary and Tory leadership favourite, David Davis, pointedly remarked: \"You never get anywhere by trashing your own brand.\" The report came as members of the 1922 committee of backbenchers voted by 127 to 50 to remove the party's universal franchise and allow members only a consultative role in selecting the leader. A substantial minority wanted an electoral college system instead, so that members would play some part in choosing their new leader. Andrew Tyrie MP, a member of the 1922's executive committee, described the outcome as \"a victory for common sense\". The decision must be still be approved by party activists and endorsed in a second ballot of MPs before the formal leadership contest can begin at the end of September. Mr Howard will stand down at the end of the year. Kenneth Clarke has offered his strongest hint yet that he could stand for a third time. The former chancellor, who is 65, told the Tory Reform Group: \"The more I consider my options, the prospect of my becoming a candidate by the autumn becomes more attractive.\" But it is unclear where he would find support as many previous backers, including Mr Green, have already indicated a preference for other candidates. Mr Davis won fresh support yesterday from Philip Hammond, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. The solutions Caring Conservatism The Tories can return to power only if they show they are in touch with contemporary, multicultural society by embracing socially progressive, female-friendly values and rejecting 'yah-boo' politics and outdated prejudices, argue modernisers such as Theresa May and Andrew Lansley. The same, but better Strong leadership, a clear message and unity are the key to electoral success. People will happily support the Conservatives if they know what they stand for. The party needs a trusted, experienced and persuasive leader such as cabinet veterans Ken Clarke and Malcolm Rifkind. Low taxes, higher vote Tories can win if they stand up for traditional Conservative principles, such as supporting stronger families, and persuade people that cutting taxes will help the poorest as well as promoting economic growth, David Davis argues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
