Think we might keep doing it.\u201d But he\u2019s not smiling, and nor is anyone else. On one side his assistant John Mitchell is staring at the back wall and on the other his captain, Owen Farrell, is looking down at his hands. England have just beaten Scotland 13-6, a good win in difficult conditions. The real question, then, is what the hell are they so angry about? They\u2019re angry about the beer bottle that hit Neil Craig on the head before the game. They\u2019re angry about the way the crowd booed Farrell while he was lining up his penalty kicks. They\u2019re angry because of the stick they got about the way they played in Paris. They\u2019re angry because they were called out for talking about \u201chate\u201d and \u201cwar\u201d in the days before the game. They\u2019re angry because they remember how the Scots celebrated after they won this fixture in 2018. They\u2019re angry because of what people have been saying to them on social media. They\u2019re angry for every reason and they\u2019re angry for one reason \u2013 because they need to be. Anger is the energy they\u2019re running on right now, the fuel Jones is using to get through this season, when they still have so much to prove, so much more hard work to do, even though they\u2019d already done so much, and proved so much in the World Cup. Just ask Ellis Genge. Just like Jones, it feels as if anger is Genge\u2019s favourite state of mind. And it\u2019s working for him. He was superb coming off the bench against France, and then again against Scotland. Genge is a player with a point to prove. When he won his first cap in 2016 he thought: \u201cRight, here we go. I\u2019m an England player.\u201d And he told Jones that, too. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m ready for it.\u201d He wasn\u2019t and Jones told him so after England drew with Scotland in this fixture last year. \u201cWe went away and he picked my game apart.\u201d He wasn\u2019t fit enough, Jones said, and he missed too many tackles. \u201cHe\u2019s been a very harsh critic of mine behind closed doors and I appreciate him for that. I need that.\u201d It made Genge go away and work harder. And yes, it can be edgy and uncomfortable and sometimes it spills over. \u201cWe\u2019ve had our spats, our arguments. It gets quite personal. I think if you don\u2019t take that stuff personally you are probably in the wrong line of work. For me I\u2019ve gone away worked on my game and it\u2019s coming to fruition.\u201d He still has a way to go, he says. But before he does he has a few of things he wants to talk through, a list of people who have pissed him off lately. The opposition. The press. The public. Pretty much everyone. \u201cListen, you\u2019ve seen that video of them lot singing about us two years ago or whenever it was,\u201d Genge says, talking about the Scots\u2019 celebrations after they won in 2018. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that and expect people to not take that personally. I\u2019ve heard it all, I\u2019ve seen it on social media, what they say about us, and you see it in the media too. And then when Lewis [Ludlam] said it was going to be a \u2018war\u2019, people were trying to attack him for that. Come on, do you know what I mean? Don\u2019t be assy about it. We want to beat them and they want to beat us. It\u2019s fact.\u201d And that bottle? \u201cWhat\u2019s that about? It\u2019s out of order.\u201d And the booing? \u201cI\u2019ll tell you for a fact, if that happened at Twickenham, which it never does, we\u2019d be getting called \u2018English this\u2019 and \u2018English that\u2019,\u201d he says, swallowing the words he\u2019d rather use. But it happens away at Murrayfield and everyone\u2019s saying: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s good for the game.\u2019 Whatever. All the stuff we\u2019ve been saying in the media, they\u2019ve been saying that here for years, and none of you have ever had the bollocks to stand up and say that it\u2019s not on. And then we say something this week and we get attacked for it.\u201d Genge was still at it after, on social media. Later on Saturday evening he posted a collage of clips of things people have said to him since the match finished. There\u2019s one calling him arrogant, another calling him a \u201ccouncil estate chav\u201d, a third calling him an idiot, complaining he was swigging a beer and talking like a zombie during his TV interview. \u201cGood win for the boys,\u201d Genge wrote above it. \u201cOn the way back to my council estate to see my illiterate friends who all talk like zombies and are all terrible role models for kids.\u201d He\u2019s sharp, on the edge, right where Jones wants him to be."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
