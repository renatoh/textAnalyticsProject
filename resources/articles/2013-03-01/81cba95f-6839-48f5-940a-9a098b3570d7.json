US president Barack Obama said he looked forward to working with Argentine Jorge Bergoglio, who chose the papal name of Francis, \"to advance peace, security and dignity for our fellow human beings, regardless of their faith\". Obama also highlighted the significance of Bergoglio being the first pope from the Americas. \"His selection also speaks to the strength and vitality of a region that is increasingly shaping our world, and alongside millions of Hispanic Americans, those of us in the United States share the joy of this historic day,\" he added. Minutes after Pope Francis, who is also the first Jesuit to be elected, addressed the crowd gathered in St Peter's Square, Rome, British prime minister David Cameron tweeted: \"A momentous day for the 1.2bn Catholics around the world as His Holiness Pope Francis I is appointed the 266th Bishop of Rome.\" On Twitter, the pope's mothballed account was revived and read: \"HABEMUS PAPAM FRANCISCUM,\" a reference to the cardinal's new name. European Union leaders Herman Van Rompuy and Jose Manuel Barroso wished the new Catholic leader \"a long and blessed pontificate.\" UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said he looked forward to working with the new pope, adding that he was certain Francis would \"build on the legacy of his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, in the promotion of inter-faith dialogue\". In South America, a range of emotions greeted news of the first pope from the continent. Even in Communist Cuba, church bells rang to celebrate his election. Catholics in Buenos Aires, where Bergoglio has been the cardinal, flocked toward the cathedral. Local resident Ana Maria Perez said: \"He is going to be the pope of the street.\" \"It's incredible!\" said Martha Ruiz, 60. She said she had been in many meetings with the cardinal. \"He is a man who transmits great serenity.\" At the St Francis of Assisi church in the colonial Old San Juan district in Puerto Rico, church secretary Antonia Veloz exchanged high-fives with Jose Antonio Cruz, a Franciscan friar. Cruz said: \"It's a huge gift for all of Latin America. We waited 20 centuries. It was worth the wait,\" said Cruz, wearing the brown cassock of the Franciscan order. \"Everyone from Canada down to Patagonia is going to feel blessed. This is an event.\" \"This is something exciting,\" the 50-year-old Veloz said. \"I'm speechless.\" In Santo Domingo, the bells pealed in the city's main cathedral in the colonial district. In Panama City, public relations executive Nelsa Aponte said with teary eyes: \"This made me cry, I had to get out my handkerchief. We have a new pastor, and for the first time, he is from Latin America.\" Archbishop Vincent Nichols, president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales expressed his joy at the news: \"As he begins his new Apostolic ministry, as the Bishop of Rome and Shepherd of the universal Church, Pope Francis may be assured of the prayers and loving support of the Catholic community throughout England and Wales.\" Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, the former head of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, said the new Pope was an \"inspired\" choice. \"He is a humble, gentle and very intelligent and spiritual man,\" he told Channel 4 News. \"I think that Pope Francis is going to be a blessing for the Catholic Church and for the world. Many will think it is a surprise choice, for me it is an inspired choice.\" The Bishop of Wakefield, the Rt Rev Stephen Platten, who is chairman of the Governors of the Anglican Centre, in Rome, and former co-secretary of the Anglican Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC), welcomed the election of Pope Francis. He said: \"It is exciting for all of us that the new Holy Father is from the New World. It is exciting too that he brings with him a profound theological background formed within the Jesuit family.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
