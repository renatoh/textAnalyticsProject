Tonight\u2019s penultimate episode was a taut and tense hour featuring a number of intriguing and enjoyable head-to-heads: not just the titular duel. Yet it\u2019s hard to see how all those storylines are going to be wrapped up in an hour next week and hard too to escape the feeling that this series is ending just as it was kicking into full gear. Our heroes It\u2019s an established law of Peaky Blinders that when the going gets tough, Tommy Shelby truly gets going, and thus it proved this week as our hero made swift work of Luca\u2019s ambush thanks to his superior knowledge of the terrain and a tip-off from Polly (as correctly called by most people below the line, well done). Unfortunately for the ever-busy Shelby he failed to eliminate his main target \u2013 even if he did make him dispense with his matchstick in fury \u2013 which means next week seems certain to be a bloodbath. Still, among Tommy\u2019s many excellent qualities is the ability to think a few steps ahead, and I\u2019m pretty sure that he intends to somehow use the arrival of the military into Birmingham and the looming General Strike as a way of neutralising all his enemies once and for all. No, I don\u2019t know exactly how he intends it all to shake down but, as with most of Tommy\u2019s schemes, this will be multi-layered. Tommy wouldn\u2019t be Tommy if he didn\u2019t also have a couple of romantic entanglements to sort out amid all the bloodshed and dodgy deals. Poor Lizzie was promised a nice house and financial support, when what she craves is emotional connection (oh Lizzie, cut your losses and find a man who appreciates that kind heart and sharp brain). Meanwhile, Jessie was treated to a candlelit dinner complete with dancing and a quick kiss. That said, if I were Tommy I\u2019d tread carefully where Jessie is concerned: their date was in its own way as menacing as the earlier confrontation between Luca Changretta and Alfie Solomons. In both cases we saw two people probing each other for intention and power and in both cases there was a considerable amount of acting going on behind the charm and fine words. As to whether it will be Tommy or Jessie who ends the series victorious having converted the other to their cause \u2013 I\u2019d say a stalemate appears the most likely outcome while noting that the truest words Tommy spoke all evening were \u201cLet\u2019s call her dangerous \u2026 she\u2019s no fool.\u201d The bad guys In an evening stuffed full of confrontations, the night\u2019s most enjoyable head-to-head was between an apparently chastened Changretta and the ever-bombastic Solomons. Their meeting was a delicate dance for power peppered with great comebacks, which settled once and for all who would win the much-anticipated Ham-Off (Tom Hardy, of course. Any doubts were settled the moment he delivered the line: \u201cI already know what you want. I just want you to tell me out loud so I can check how ridiculous it is.\u201d) Here the true extent of Luca\u2019s ambition was revealed: his visit to Birmingham was power grab as much as vendetta. Tommy recognised it and Alfie astutely confirmed it, which is why I don\u2019t believe for one moment that Solomons has set the Peaky Blinders up, rum deal or no rum deal. Alfie has always had a head for business and there was a reason Tommy showed him the gin distillery. I expect that the finale will see the united firm of Shelby and Solomons make their bid for Prohibition glory \u2013 the question remains, is Luca aware of that or has his \u201cnatural Italian fucking arrogance\u201d blinded him to Alfie\u2019s \u201cJewish air of absolute certainty\u201d? And what role will Aberama Gold play in all this mayhem? I continue to have bad feelings about him (and not simply because he\u2019s played by Aidan Gillen, a man who has built a career out of playing untrustworthy characters). He\u2019s the most uneasy and unpredictable of allies because, unlike Alfie, he is not driven by the desire to make a profit. Polly, herself increasingly untethered to society, recognised that (and astutely played on Aberama\u2019s belief in ghosts and witches), but what is the true price of their fragile alliance? I can\u2019t help wondering if when the blood and dust settles next week we may find out that this alliance is the real betrayal and she has \u201cfreed\u201d herself from Tommy to join forces with her \u201cvery unsuitable man\u201d. Additional notes Poor old Arthur, back on the Tokyo and falling apart at the seams. Linda will have her work cut out saving his soul this time. I wish Ada had more time on this show. Her confrontations with both the suave Colonel Younger and Tommy were hugely entertaining. Bonnie Gold has the cold-eyes of a killer and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s prepared to obey anyone\u2019s rules. Never has a man looked more unsuited to life on the road than Michael. Will he make it to the end of the series? I\u2019m genuinely unsure. Someone needs to tell Luca that a code of honour is the last thing you need on the mean streets of Small Heath. \u201cTell the people who live in these houses that they are free to go about their lawful business. Tell them that the rule of law has been restored.\u201d Why, Inspector Moss, is that a spine you\u2019ve regrown? Anachronistic yet strangely right song of the week Laura Marling\u2019s haunting Saved These Words was smartly used during the aftermath of Tommy\u2019s shoot-out, but this week\u2019s award goes to Iggy Pop and Jarvis Cocker\u2019s atmospheric slowed-down take on Red Right Hand. Quote of the week \u201cOf course, I\u2019m sorry, Tommy Shelby is going to stop the revolution with his cock ...\u201d The ever-astute Ada says what we were all thinking. So what did you think? Will Alfie betray Tommy or is this part of a double-bluff to take out Luca? What mischief will come of Aberama and Polly\u2019s relationship? And if you were going to stop a revolution what appendage would you use?
