In April, the company said on Thursday, Schultz will become \u201cexecutive chairman\u201d, and the Kevin Johnson, chief operating officer, will step up to replace him. Shares of the coffee retailer\u2019s stock took a sharp dive on the news in after-hours trading, dropping 3.3% to $56.78. Schultz, who will remain chairman of the board, will devote time to furthering a \u201csocial impact agenda\u201d, he said in a call with investors. His duties will also include developing new technologies for Starbucks stores, like the company\u2019s recent foray into carbonated \u201cnitro\u201d cold brew. In 2000, Schultz left the CEO position after running the company since 1987; in early 2008 he returned to steer it through the financial crisis after the company lost half its value on the stock market over the course of a single year. The coffeehouse chain\u2019s current situation is different from its position eight years ago, Schultz said, because the 2016 management team was better-suited to the challenges of the market than 2008\u2019s senior staff had been. The move is not entirely a surprise. Schultz stepped down from a seat on the board he will now chair in 2013, and rumors about his political aspirations have circulated for some time. A spokeswoman for the company dismissed them. \u201cHoward has long said that we need to stop looking to Washington DC for wisdom and inspiration, and instead look for it in our cities and towns, in businesses and community organizations, and in one another,\u201d she told the Guardian. Schultz \u201chas no plans to run for political office, as he has said many times, and will remain with the company\u201d, she said. In his new position, Schultz will shift focus to \u201cretail innovation\u201d, the company said in a press release. Schultz said that he was \u201cdelighted\u201d Johnson would take over his duties and said he would focus on finding \u201cthe balance between profit and conscience\u201d with the company\u2019s veteran-hiring programs and its anti-poverty programs. \u201cI think we can all agree, Republican or Democrat, that there\u2019s a lot of people being left behind and that companies can do more for the communities they serve and for the people they employ,\u201d Schultz told investors. Schultz has been a very public CEO. The coffee executive had been vocally political during the 2016 election season, telling CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow, \u201cI think it\u2019s obvious that Hillary Clinton needs to be our next president\u201d in September. The company overwhelmingly contributed money to the Clinton campaign \u2013 nearly $65,000 to Trump\u2019s $1,400 in contributions. Schultz wrote a downbeat memo to staff when Trump won the election: \u201c[L]ike so many of our fellow Americans \u2013 both Democrats and Republicans \u2013 I am stunned,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world,\u201d Schultz wrote, though he said he was \u201chopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division\u201d of the season. On the conference call, Schultz was more upbeat: \u201cThese are exciting times for us all,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
