After his victory in Florida, an exuberant McCain told supporters that on February 5th, \"we will have as close to a national primary as we've ever had in this country. I intend to win it and be the nominee of our party.\" Give McCain this: the \"intend to win\" line was as close as he came to gloating in the entire victory speech. He praised Romney supporters for \"[fighting] hard for your candidate\" and offered consolation, saying, \"the margin that separated us tonight surely isn't big enough for me to brag about or for you to despair.\" The senator praised fourth place finisher Rudy Giuliani for inspiring \"me and millions of Americans\" and lauded third place Mike Huckabee's \"good humour and grace.\" One might argue that this fitted well with McCain's history as a fierce warrior and determined peacemaker. As a prisoner of war, he resisted the Viet Cong with all his cussed, vulgar might, and was severely beaten for it. As a senator, he was more insistent than any of his colleagues that relations between the US and Vietnam must be normalised, and won. But his magnanimity this time was self-serving. Why self-serving? Because McCain has a conservative problem that he's trying to solve. A huge number of American right-wingers despise him - Ann Coulter even said she'd campaign for Hillary Clinton if McCain wins the Republican nomination - and he's not quite sure what to do about it. If it was a simple disagreement over issues, McCain might be able to flip-flop his way out of it, and indeed, he's tried. The testiest exchange between McCain and Romney so far was in a New Hampshire debate, when McCain accused Romney of lying about his record over the issue of \"amnesty\" for illegal immigrants. McCain used to favour a fairly easy path to citizenship for millions of undocumented foreign workers, but now he has come around to the \"enforcement first\" position. That is: first secure the porous southern border, and then we'll see about what to do next. It hasn't worked. Many conservatives have been willing to excuse Romney's flip-flops on a whole number of issues, from immigration to abortion to gun control, but not McCain's. They'd rather throw their lot in with the former one-term governor of the most liberal state in the union than vote for a senator with an 82% lifetime American Conservative Union (ACU) voting record, who rails against pork-barrel spending and voted against the Bush initiative to have Medicare pay for prescription drugs for old folks. This perceived double standard incenses McCain supporters, who scream hypocrisy. Even if true, that's beside the point. Romney has consistently moved right on issues that matter to conservative activists and McCain, who prides himself on being a \"maverick\", has moved the other way. In 2005, his ACU score was 80%. In 2006, the last year for which ratings are available, it fell to 65%. Moreover, his McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill makes it difficult for interested non-profits to advertise such inconvenient facts during the primary or general elections. A look at a politician's supporters can also be instructive. In California, the high-spending, socially liberal, environmentally-friendly governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has endorsed McCain. In Virginia, state delegate David Albo, author of the hated \"abuser fees\" that tacked thousands of dollars onto routine speeding tickets, serves on the McCain steering committee. In Florida, he was endorsed by governor Charlie Crist, whose heavy-handed approach to regulating the insurance industry has led some observers to label him a \"socialist\". Granted, there may be something mildly irrational or even desperate in the conservative rush to embrace Romney, but opposition to McCain makes good philosophical sense. Though the senator has lately tried to argue that he's one of Ronald Reagan's legitimate heirs, it's not true. McCain's conservatism is much closer to an imperialistic Toryism than Reaganism. He opposes congressman-earmarked spending because he thinks it's unseemly and undermines trust in government. More populist and libertarian-minded conservatives tend to believe trust in government is the problem. And that's a problem for John McCain. Because of the front-loaded primary schedule, his lead in several winner-take-all states, and the continued presence of Mike Huckabee as an evangelical spoiler, he may capture enough delegates to win his party's nomination. But that still leaves the Democrat-tilted general election, where the Republican nominee is going to need every possible vote to prevail. Many conservatives are so mad at McCain that even the threat of a Hillary Clinton presidency won't budge them.
