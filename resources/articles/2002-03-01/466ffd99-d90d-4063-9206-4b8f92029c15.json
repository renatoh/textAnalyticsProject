Mapmaker Fra Mauro relocated the fabulous monarch Prester John in Africa - Marco Polo having testified that he wasn't in China, where he was supposed to dwell splendidly. The Peutinger Table, an 11th-century copy of a Roman strip map showing only the roads more travelled (the hell with the rest of the country) resembles early automobile route books (\"turn left at the first red barn\"). You could probably sail the African coast now with the 1351 Laurentian chart, and the 1375 Catalan Atlas added the Blue Nile, deleted monsters and only got vague around the Scots coast. Ace.
