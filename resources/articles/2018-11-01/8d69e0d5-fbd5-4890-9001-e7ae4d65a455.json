That is what really makes people angry,\u201d Andrews told the Nine Network on Sunday. \u201cThey want politicians who say what they are going to do, and then get on and do it. Where that leaves (the prime minister Scott) Morrison I leave it for you to judge.\u201d On day one of term two, Andrews did the rounds on breakfast television, championing his \u201cpositive and optimistic plan\u201d for the state and decrying the Liberal-Nationals\u2019 attempts to \u201cscare\u201d their way into power. Victorian Labor will return to majority government with as many as 16 more seats following the ballot result that shocked even the winners. As of Sunday morning, about 71 per cent of lower house ballots had been counted and Labor grabbed 52 seats, with another 10 in doubt. The Coalition lost half of its seats and calls were being made for senior Liberal party figures to resign. The opposition leader Matthew Guy conceded defeat. The Coalition vote also collapsed in electorates traditionally held by conservatives, including in eastern suburbs such as Ringwood, where there was a swing toward Labor of more than 9%, and the blue-ribbon Hawthorn, held by the shadow attorney general, John Pessuto, but under threat of falling to Labor. \u201cWe did a lot of things right but obviously something has gone horribly wrong,\u201d Pessuto said. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to clearly have to do a root and branch review. We shouldn\u2019t be in this position.\u201d The result makes Andrews the first premier to win a second term since Steve Bracks in 2006. An alleged terrorist attack in the city just one fortnight before the election fuelled the Coalition\u2019s law and order campaign, but this failed to sway voters and appears to have worked against them. The ABC psephologist Antony Green had called victory for Labor by 7.20pm. Andrews told party faithful at Labor party headquarters in Mulgrave that Labor was \u201cthe most progressive government in the nation\u201d and that voters had \u201cin record numbers rejected the low road of fear and division\u201d. \u201cAnd for that, I am very, very proud.\u201d The federal Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, said Victorians had \u201ccomprehensively\u201d rejected the tough-on-crime messaging of the Coalition, which he said had the potential to \u201cdivide the Australian community\u201d and \u201cattack\u201d multiculturalism. \u201cI thought the Victorian community said very loudly and clearly: \u2018We reject a campaign based on fear and division\u2019,\u201d Di Natale said. \u201cI want to congratulate Daniel Andrews and the Labor party.\u201d But the Greens were headed towards a disappointing result, with Brunswick on a knife-edge despite the party running a comprehensive campaign there and predictions they would gain they seat. The party was also projected to lose Northcote and in difficulty in their seat of Prahran. Albert Park and Richmond, also seats where the Greens had hoped to make gains, were seeing swings towards Labor. The party\u2019s hopes of forming minority government were dashed. While analysts focused on critical bellwether seats like on the Frankston line like Bentleigh, Mordialloc, Carrum and Frankston, all won by the party forming government at the last four elections, the swing against the Liberal party in seats believed to be safe was unprecedented. In the very safe seat of Box Hill in the east, for example, there was a 14% swing towards Labor. In Ferntree Gully, held by the Liberals by 7.7%, there was an 8.7% swing against the Liberals by the time 21.7% of the vote was counted. The Liberals held the affluent bayside electorate of Brighton by 9.7% at the last election but by 10pm the 19-year-old Labor candidate, Declan Martin, was only marginally behind. There were shouts of joy and chants of \u201cfour more years\u201d in Mulgrave as more seats kept falling Labor\u2019s way. Statewide, Labor saw a swing towards it of about 6%. The Coalition was projected to hold just 17 seats at most. \u201cAbout those who today could not see their way clear to support our positive and optimistic plan \u2026 we will still govern for you, we will govern for all Victorians,\u201d Andrews said in Mulgrave. \u201cWe will make sure that regardless of how you voted, we will have better schools, we will have better hospitals, we will build the infrastructure we need and create the jobs that are so important.\u201d The leadership spill three months ago, which saw Malcolm Turnbull, popular in parts of Victoria, replaced by Scott Morrison, had an impact. Federal politics played a part in the Coalition bloodbath, the shadow education minister, Tim Smith, said. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got federal politicians talking about themselves and their various ambitions, that hasn\u2019t helped our party like it didn\u2019t help Labor during the Rudd Gillard years,\u201d he said. In his concession speech the Liberal leader, Matthew Guy, said his party had campaigned on issues \u201cof the most importance to Victorians\u201d. \u201cTonight is clearly not our night,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that. We acknowledge that. We accept that.\u201d Immediately after his short speech Guy left the stage and shut himself in an administration office, while his colleagues cleared out of the venue at the Veneto Club in Bulleen by 9.30pm. Guy left the venue without giving interviews. The former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett called on the Liberal party state president, Michael Kroger, to resign. \u201cMichael, if you\u2019re listening, it\u2019s 8.20pm \u2013 by midnight, I hope your resignation is on the floor,\u201d Kennett told Seven News. As the night went on there were also signs of possible upsets in the regions, somewhat overshadowed by Labor\u2019s overwhelming victory. Cathy McGowan-endorsed independent Jacqui Hawkins remains in with a shot in Benambra in Victoria\u2019s north-east, while Ali Cupper is also a chance of nabbing Mildura from the Nationals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
