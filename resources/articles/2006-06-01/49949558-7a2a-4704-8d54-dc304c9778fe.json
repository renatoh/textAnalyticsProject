Trinidad &amp; Tobago are seen as no-hopers, England and Sweden as certain qualifiers and Paraguay as a team who will fall just short. Try convincing the South Americans, though, that their fate lies in a rapid exit. As the former Newcastle midfielder Diego Gavil\u00e1n chats after training it becomes clear they regard such predictions as flawed. Paraguay have reached the second round of the past two World Cups and then given fancied opponents difficult matches. In 1998 they were six minutes from taking the hosts France to a shoot-out when Laurent Blanc scored a golden goal. Four years later Germany defeated them with a goal in the 88th minute. Gavil\u00e1n warns against dismissing this squad, which took four points off Argentina in qualifying. \"We respect all opinions but Paraguay is a strong team in South America, like England is in Europe,\" he says. \"Paraguay have very good boys, some with experience, others very young, and this World Cup is maybe the best team Paraguay has had. \"We know we have to fight, not just against England but against Sweden and against Trinidad &amp; Tobago as well. We have to respect them all the same. If in England everybody says that Paraguay will not pass to the next round that's better for us because we have confidence, but we know we have to play the football.\" That starts against England on Saturday and An\u00edbal Ruiz's squad feel capable of causing an upset. \"Yes, why not?\" Gavil\u00e1n says. \"Especially because I know the squad is in great shape and is at a great moment. Our coach knows everybody, which is very important because at the last World Cup Cesare Maldini did not know the players very well, or which players could do better than others. Ruiz knows everyone very well and I don't see why Paraguay cannot beat England.\" The only two previous meetings between the teams have ended in comprehensive England wins, 3-0 at the 1986 World Cup after two goals from Gary Lineker and 4-0 in a friendly at Anfield in 2002. Gavil\u00e1n played in the game four years ago and accepts that Paraguay will have to perform far better but he likes the fact that all the expectation is on England. \"For us it's better,\" he says. \"If you are favourites and you don't do well, it's not good for your country. If people think you have only a small chance and you do well it's better because you have more motivation. The boys are doing very well and in every training session and every friendly we have been thinking about England.\" Paraguay came to Europe ahead of several teams travelling similar distances to adjust to the time difference and conditions. They have drawn with Norway and Denmark and beaten Georgia and have avoided too much excitement at Wayne Rooney's injury problems. \"Rooney is a great player but you have Owen, Crouch and other strikers with the same quality,\" says Gavil\u00e1n, a likely substitute on Saturday. \"We respect all the team and all the stars England have, not just Rooney. We will have to play against Lampard, Gerrard and Beckham so England are not just about Rooney and we have to respect them as a team. \"They are a very difficult team to play because they are very strong, they play very fast. It is different football from what we play in South America but these friendlies against Norway and Denmark were for us to do everything that we can to prepare to play against England.\" Judging by the sight of Ruiz joshing in training with one of his players over a free-kick he had awarded, the relationship between players and coach is strong. Ruiz, a Uruguayan, took over from Maldini after the last World Cup, initially on a temporary basis, and his squad has plenty of experience, both of European football and previous World Cups. The right-back Denis Caniza and the central defender Carlos Gamarra are among those who featured in 1998 and 2002, and Gamarra has so far played eight World Cup matches without conceding a free-kick. Options up front include the Bundesliga strikers Nelson Haedo Valdez and Roque Santa Cruz. Bayern Munich's Santa Cruz is working his way back from a knee injury. \"Santa Cruz is a very strong man, mentally and physically, so we hope he can play in the first game,\" Gavil\u00e1n says. \"If not, we have [Jos\u00e9] Cardozo and [Nelson] Cuevas and Haedo - big players who can do better or the same as Santa Cruz.\" Paraguay have no intention of being on the first flight back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
