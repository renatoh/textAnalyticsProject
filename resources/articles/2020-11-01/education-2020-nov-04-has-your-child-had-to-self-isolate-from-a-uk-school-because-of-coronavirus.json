How did you explain what was happening to your child, particularly if they are very young? Tell us more about the experience: what was the impact of them of isolating from the outside world again, or knowing that they were considered a risk to other people? How willing was your child to return to their school or nursery afterwards and how did they feel about staff? How did you cope balancing work and sudden unexpected extra childcare? What support did you get from employers and from schools or nurseries? We\u2019ve heard from a number of parents about kids experiencing rolling self-isolation: how many times has your child been asked to stay at home since schools and childcare setting started up again?
