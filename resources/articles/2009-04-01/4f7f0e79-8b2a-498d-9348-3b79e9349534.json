In a wide-ranging Easter interview, the former prime minister spoke of his religious faith being a \"comfort\" to him at all times. Blair also denied that his foreign policy had helped recruit terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan and described acts of terrorism as \"utterly evil\". He told BBC Radio 3's Belief programme that his decision to go to war in Iraq had not been taken lightly. \"I do not pass a single day in which I do not reflect on this and think of the responsibility. I think these decisions are the most difficult you ever take, and you cannot and should not take them incidentally because you believe that you have some religious conviction that's superior to anyone else.\" The consequences of action were \"serious\" but so were the results of inaction, he said. Blair, now Middle East envoy for the Quartet of the US, UN, EU and Russia, denied that Britain had \"provoked\" terrorism by taking part in conflicts abroad. On Afghanistan, he said: \"The people from those groups that back the Taliban that then go in and plant a car bomb \u2013 how are we provoking them to do that? \"That's what has to be challenged, and actually one of the reasons why we will not defeat this, in my view, until we start challenging this position within Islam and outside of Islam, is because there is no reason why they should do that.\" He added: \"I think actually these acts of terrorism are utterly evil \u2013 yes, I do. \"And when you think of the numbers of wholly innocent people that have died, you see that's why I don't say the people with responsibility for the deaths are the people that remove the bad regime that everyone accepts as bad. \"I say the responsibility lies with the people doing the terrorism because there's no reason for them to do the terrorism.\" In January Blair said that he thought about the soldiers and civilians who died in the Iraq war every day and suffered from continued doubts about whether he did the right thing. Blair, who converted to Catholicism after leaving Downing Street in 2007, said his religious faith was a \"comfort to me all the time\". He said: \"In the end you accept there is a higher power than yourself and that is both something that should make you fearful, but something that also is a source of comfort.\" Blair also revealed his first spiritual experience, as he remembered praying with his headmaster at school when he was 10 years old. His father \u2013 \"a kind of militant atheist\" \u2013 had just had a stroke and was rushed to hospital. Blair said: \"I remember actually praying with the headmaster of the school. I said to him: 'Before we pray, I should tell you that my father, he doesn't believe in God.' \"And I always remember the headmaster saying to me: 'Well that doesn't matter, because God believes in him.' \"I was in a great state of emotion, and then at the end of the day my father was clear, he was going to live. But what I know is it made a \u2013 as it would, on a 10-year-old child \u2013 tremendous impact on me.\" \u2022 Belief is on BBC Radio 3 at 11pm today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
