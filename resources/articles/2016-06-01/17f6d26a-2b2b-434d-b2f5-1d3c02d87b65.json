Wilshere, to be clear, was showing a neat line in humour once he had come down the long, gravelly path to Les Fontaines, the chateau in Chantilly where players make themselves available for interview. He blew out his cheeks in admiration when asked about Rooney\u2019s performance against Russia and, if one thing came across from listening to the Arsenal player, it was the complete absence of any personal grievance. \u201cIt hurts me to say but he plays the position unbelievably,\u201d Wilshere began. \u201cI\u2019ve said it before: he\u2019s our best player. He\u2019s got that range of passing, he understands the game. He can still play up front in my opinion. He can be a striker, now a midfielder, and he was our best player against Russia. Everything went through him. I just love watching him, I love playing with him.\u201d Such a eulogy makes it feel like a trick of the mind that only a few days ago Rooney\u2019s place in the team had not just been a matter of public debate but led to some lengthy conversations between Roy Hodgson and his coaching staff. Rooney played with so much distinction that Wilshere was asked if he saw similarities with Andrea Pirlo and, for a player in that position, there really is no higher compliment. \u201cYes, because he understands the game so well,\u201d was Wilshere\u2019s take. \u201cHis appreciation of the strikers\u2019 positions \u2026 he reads their runs when not many other people would even see the pass. To get that pass right, with the right weight, takes a special player. Or the times, in training as well, when he picks up the ball deep and sprays a long pass. He never gets one wrong, he\u2019s always perfect. That\u2019s when you can tell he has something special. \u201cI watched him towards the end of the season playing for Manchester United in that deeper role and people were saying: \u2018Can he do it?\u2019 I was sitting there thinking: \u2018He\u2019s doing it and he\u2019s the best player on the pitch.\u2019 People say he is not as quick as he used to be but his understanding of the game \u2026\u201d That, of course, presents Wilshere with a problem regarding his own selection against Wales on Thursday and the same goes for Jordan Henderson and James Milner if, as expected, Hodgson decides to keep Rooney in his new position. Equally nobody should under-estimate Hodgson\u2019s loyalty towards Wilshere, given that the 24-year-old is here on the back of only one Premier League start for Arsenal last season and, astonishingly, without having managed a full match for his club since 23 September 2014. Wilshere read one report recently pointing out that Leeds United had appointed six managers in that time. Or to put it another way, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 117 times since Wilshere lasted 90 minutes in Arsenal\u2019s colours. Yet Hodgson still chose him ahead of Danny Drinkwater, one of the genuine heroes of Leicester City\u2019s championship season. \u201cI\u2019m thankful to him,\u201d Wilshere said of the England manager. \u201cI have a great relationship with him and always have. We stayed in contact throughout my injury. He was loyal to me. And I want to repay that.\u201d Wilshere\u2019s guess is that the game in Lens will feel like a derby match. \u201cIt is going to be tough, there are going to be tackles. It is going to be like a Premier League game. If you put both teams down on paper we would win but it doesn\u2019t work like that in football.\u201d It is also clear England\u2019s strategy will be, in considerable part, to negate the threat of Gareth Bale. \u201cLionel Messi is on a different planet to anyone,\u201d Wilshere said, \u201cbut Ronaldo and Bale are up there with the best in the world.\u201d Will England man-mark Bale? \u201cI don\u2019t think so. We need to do what we did the other night [against Russia]. When we lose the ball we have to stop them counterattacking and win the ball back straight away. We have done that over the last couple of years and we have got better and better at it. \u201cObviously everyone was disappointed about what happened against Russia but after sleeping on it and watching the game back we actually put in a really good performance. I can\u2019t remember an England team that I have played in that has played football like that. In the past we have been criticised for not being able to keep the ball under pressure, not being technically good enough, wasteful in possession. But on Saturday I felt we kept the ball well. If we couldn\u2019t get in down one side, we came out, we went through midfield, we played really well. If it wasn\u2019t for the late goal everyone would have been delighted.\u201dWilshere, to use his own description, is \u201cdesperate\u201d to play and, temporarily, he also seems to have forgotten the Football Association\u2019s instruction not to say anything even mildly controversial. \u201cWe know that Wales don\u2019t like us,\u201d he volunteered matter-of-factly. And do England like them? \u201cNot really.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
