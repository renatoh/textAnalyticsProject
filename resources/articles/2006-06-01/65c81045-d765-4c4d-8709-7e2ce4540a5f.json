When the public is asked how we would like to see the licence fee spent we never say \"more makeover shows, lots and lots of sport, far more repeats, and some trashy reality formats which both exploit and humiliate the public\" - despite the fact that this could be a pretty close description of what we actually watch. Nor do people say \"more imports\". It is hard to believe that there was a time when as many of the BBC's flagship programmes came from America as were made in Britain. Dallas, Dynasty, Kojak, Starsky and Hutch - Saturday night for two decades was American import night. Likewise ITV housed a slew of imported primetime programming - from Columbo to LA Law. It is extraordinary to think that after 20 years of fairly progressive globalisation, it should make news that the BBC has bought an American series - in this case Three Pounds, a medical drama, starring Stanley Tucci. But the issue seems to be whether the BBC should be in the international acquisitions market at all. Thirteen episodes at \u00a3300,000 a pop is \u00a34m, which would buy you about six episodes of highish quality British drama, or notoriously expensive to make and difficult to develop comedy. As pounds per minute go, Three Pounds is pretty good value. It is also true that the intelligent buying of American shows has immensely improved British television in both production techniques and quality of writing. Looking across the almost entirely homegrown output of the BBC these days, one can see a quality and style which might not be a copy of US drama and comedy production but is certainly influenced by it. But at a time when the BBC is probably producing a higher volume of top quality programming in more areas than ever before, should it be holding back in the acquisitions market to let its more challenged domestic rivals have a go? First of all let's remember that the BBC does have an awful lot of money. It has, since the last licence fee settlement in 1998, seen the level of the licence fee rise by 15% in real terms and, additionally, because of the increase in number of households, there are 15% more homes now paying the licence fee than there were in 1998 - as a result it now receives over \u00a33bn a year. Over the same period ITV would point to the fact that its own income has dropped in real terms to less than \u00a31.7bn. But then ITV is also out of the acquisitions market, leaving Five and Channel 4 as the principal terrestrial contenders, with Sky perpetually lurking in the wings with a large bag of cash. If the BBC's activities in the international programme market were stifling the development of UK drama, then one could argue that it should not be buying American drama. But even this is fairly tenuous - the BBC has not always made particularly great calls in this area but it is rarely through lack of funds and more through lack of audience. The BBC might also have paid Jonathan Ross two or three times the amount Three Pounds cost to keep him at the corporation this week. Paying a presenter several million pounds a year might be highly controversial - but Ross is a great talent and offers an emotional connection between the BBC and its audience which is vital if it is to retain its popularity and licence fee. There is nothing wrong with imports on the BBC - Heimat, 24, even The Simpsons did something UK producers at the time could not. But the time is coming when the BBC's economic and creative strength might dictate that there are at least certain areas where it has to be muzzled - if only to give the others a chance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
