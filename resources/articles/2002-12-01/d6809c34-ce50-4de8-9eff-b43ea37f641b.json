Fulham believe the agents may have contravened Fifa rules by acting for Lyon as well as themselves in the \u00a311.5m deal in August 2001. The club's chairman Mohamed Al Fayed wants to discover exactly where the money paid for Marlet ended up, which would have to come out in open court. Questions are being asked at Fulham about whether part of the money they paid Lyon has found its way to the agents, who were mandated to act only on Fulham's behalf. They also wonder whether the agents helped to bump up the cost of Marlet, whose price raised eyebrows given that he was not a regular for France. The agents, BMB Conseils, have invoiced Fulham for about \u00a32m for helping with the move and have been paid about half. Fulham have withheld further commission payments and they are ready to start legal action within weeks to recover the money they handed over. Fulham worked with BMB, run by the Boisseau brothers S\u00e9bastien and Pascal, in Marlet's transfer but fear the agents may have acted improperly in also aiding Lyon and striking further payment deals with the French club. Fulham have conducted an internal investigation and may pass the results to the Football Association. The club have stated that Jean Tigana's role in the transfer was entirely above board. BMB have lodged a formal complaint with the FA about Fulham's refusal to pay and deny any wrongdoing. Fulham have contacted Lyon for help with their investigation, seeking information in particular on BMB's role, but are understood to feel frustrated by the club's response. They may choose to withhold the final payment of Marlet's fee, which Lyon said was due next week, until they are certain about the destination of all the money. Lyon said yesterday that they expected the instalment on time and denied paying BMB. \"The agents were used solely by Fulham,\" a club spokesman said. \"They were mandated by Fulham and we never employed them regarding this transfer. None of the money we receive will go to them. Any money that they receive will come from Fulham.\" S\u00e9bastien Boisseau said his agency have done nothing untoward. \"We have no particular worries, we are very calm about it,\" he said. \"There was no particular problem with the Marlet transfer and we don't understand why all this is happening. If there were questions to be settled, we would refer back to the FA. We have already spoken with them and we will contact them again to assess the situation. If necessary we will go to England to discuss it with them.\" Fifa will investigate only if the matter is brought to its attention. It said that agents could be disciplined for acting for the buying and selling clubs, with punishments including a fine or a ban from working. \"It's a conflict of interests,\" a spokesman explained. \"The club releasing the player wants to get as much money as possible, whereas the club buying wants to get the player as cheap as possible.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
