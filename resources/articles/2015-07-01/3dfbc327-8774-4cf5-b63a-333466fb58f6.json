Shaw has impressed on United\u2019s tour of the United States, with the 20-year-old benefiting from the rest he was given by not participating at the European Under-21 Championship with England earlier in the close season. Last season he suffered nine differing injuries and struggled to show the pace and form that persuaded Van Gaal to buy him after he played for England at the World Cup in Brazil. But the manager pointed to how Shaw is a young player and he feels sure United will see the best of him when the campaign starts with Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s visit to Old Trafford on 8 August. \u201cLuke Shaw is a big talent. He\u2019s very young so it\u2019s not so easy for him to come from Southampton to as big a club as Manchester United,\u201d said Van Gaal. \u201cI think that it shall be the season of Luke Shaw, that I believe. I believe in him and he has to feel that and I hope he shall show it. But he\u2019s 20 years old. How many players of that age are playing in the Premier League?\u201d Shaw is expected to begin the new season as the first-choice left-back. Daley Blind can also operate in the position, though he has so far been played in central defence in United\u2019s three tour matches. \u201cI already said many times I play where the manager needs me,\u201d said Blind. \u201cNow he gives me the chance in this position and I try to do my best,\u201d he said. \u201cI have played there before, so I know what is asked of me.\u201d Adnan Januzaj also faces a crucial season due to questions over the forward\u2019s temperament. Van Gaal and his coaching staff believe the 20-year-old could apply himself better and draw more from his talent. Januzaj was among the best United players during David Moyes\u2019s tenure as manager two years ago. But since then his form has been uneven and he is yet to convince Van Gaal that he deserves a starting berth. The manager was encouraged by the 20-year-old\u2019s goal in United\u2019s 3-1 victory over Barcelona on Saturday\u2019s. However Van Gaal wants to see consistently high performances from the Belgian."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
