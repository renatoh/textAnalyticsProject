Britain?", "bodyText": "As Nick Nurse went through his final preparations on Thursday night, a message came through on his phone from an old friend. \u201cI get in touch before every game, mostly,\u201d says Nigel Lloyd, one of the standout players on the Birmingham Bullets team that Nurse coached to a British Basketball League (BBL) title in 1996. \u201cHe was getting a lot of grief about a timeout he made in Game 5. So I just said to him, \u2018Good luck tonight. Stick to your instincts. You\u2019ve been right so far.\u2019 And he messaged me back \u2013 and this is before the game now so I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Dude, you need to concentrate\u2019 \u2013 and he said, \u2018Good point\u2019. When the game finished, I just said to him, \u2018Congrats, well done\u2019. And Nick gets back to me with a message that reads, \u2018Thanks, Nigel, it feels exactly like \u201896\u2019\u201d. After guiding the Toronto Raptors to a historic 4-2 series win over the heavily-fancied Golden State Warriors in the NBA finals \u2013 ensuring a first-ever championship for the Canadian team \u2013 Nurse walked into the post-game press conference and discussed his unlikely rise, with a specific nod to his long stint in the UK. \u201cAll those jobs meant the world to me at the time,\u201d he said, referring to a coaching career that began with the Derby Rams in 1990 and continued through stints in London, Manchester and Brighton before he returned to his native US and tasted success in the NBA minor leagues. \u201cI loved all of them. Whether it was winning with Birmingham or with Rio Grande Valley. I never really got discouraged. I didn\u2019t really care about the level I was coaching at. I just wanted to learn and get better.\u201d He arrived in the East Midlands a lifetime ago, hired by Derby owner Tim Rudge as a player-coach. Nurse had just finished a scholarship at the University of Northern Iowa, where he had built a solid reputation on and off the court. He had served as an assistant to Eldon Miller and although the NBA was never an option, he still felt there were some playing opportunities further afield. He sent his CV to various teams around the globe but heard nothing. Then Rudge called, offered him a dual role and Nurse made his BBL debut five days later. \u201cHe was in his early 20s but looked about 16 or 17 and was quite scrawny\u201d says Martin Ford, who was part of that Derby team. \u201cAnd he was pedantic. It was all about precision. \u2018You sprint down the floor and you stand at this point because this is the optimum place you need to be to start our offense\u2019. Now, that point was about half a square meter. So, the biggest thing I took from him was the pinpoint positioning of players.\u201d The team travelled to games in a white van. It was customary for the coach to drive but Nurse wasn\u2019t old enough to take the wheel of a rental so Ford, the starting center, stepped up instead. \u201cA couple of times it broke down on the M1, driving back from Thames Valley and Crystal Palace,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI tried to cradle it to the service area but didn\u2019t manage it so we had to offload on the motorway and wait for assistance. A slight difference to what Nick is used to now.\u201d Nurse used the unconventional travel experience to his advantage. It allowed him to build relationships, namely with Ford. And that led to trust and the players committing fully to what their coach wanted. \u201cHe was my co-driver,\u201d Ford says. \u201cHe\u2019d sit in the front and we\u2019d chat. He was interested in you as a person. He wanted to know about my work, my family. That keeps you grounded as an individual but it also allows you to almost demand more from other people. I remember one game and it was tight. I\u2019d got injured, rolled my ankle or something. He took a timeout, came up to me and said, \u2018I need you out there. I know you\u2019re hurt but there are young lads here who don\u2019t have the experience so you\u2019ve got to come out and give me everything you have to try and help us win this game now.\u2019 Because he\u2019d got to know me and because he\u2019d allowed us to get to know him, we understood that desire to win. He created that within us. So I was quite happy to get back out there.\u201d Kevin Routledge, chairman of the BBL during much of Nurse\u2019s time there, also noticed Nurse\u2019s talent. \u201cThe players knew he was for them,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they were going to go the extra mile. It\u2019s not about how much they get paid or the training facilities. Ultimately, it\u2019s about how much they buy into a coaching philosophy. It\u2019s a completely different circumstance Nick is in now but it\u2019s still about getting five guys out there, playing for each other.\u201d Since taking charge of the Raptors last summer, Nurse has frequently mentioned the one season he spent in Birmingham. You can understand why. While there, he first bumped into Masai Ujiri, a journeyman player, then lining out for Derby. Decades later, Ujiri \u2013 born in Bournemouth but raised in Nigeria \u2013 would become Raptors general manager and hire Nurse to replace Dwayne Casey as head coach. When Ujiri followed up that appointment by signing superstar Kawhi Leonard, Nurse claimed the last player he coached of that calibre was Tony Dorsey, a key member of the Bullets team. \u201cDorsey was the unstoppable force, like Kawhi,\u201d says Lloyd, who Nurse compared to Kyle Lowry. \u201cThere are a lot of similarities. Nick references that period all the time. He doesn\u2019t have to say it was like \u201896. He\u2019s won other championships. But 1996 was the first final, the first time he put a team together, when he figured out the way he wanted to coach and try out a lot of new things. Like the Raptors, we ran into the top team \u2013 London Towers, who\u2019d won everything. We weren\u2019t supposed to beat them but we ended up doing it at Wembley. \u201cI remember our last practice before we headed to London and it was one of the calmest practices we ever had. Whatever he said to do, we all did it. Similar to how Toronto were this year. No emotion, everyone knew what they had to do, the goals they had to accomplish ... he had us so prepared going into that weekend. You looked around and everyone was focused. It was a special feeling. It just felt different.\u201d Nurse won another championship with Manchester Giants in 2000 and was twice voted Coach of the Year. During his final spell in the UK with Brighton Bears, he ended up as head coach, general manager and owner. Memorably, three days after his eviction from the Celebrity Big Brother house, five-time NBA champion Dennis Rodman played for Nurse against the Guildford Heat and stuck around for two more games. \u201cThat was him thinking outside the box,\u201d Routledge says. \u201cHe saw the opportunity and had the audacity to pull it off. It was great publicity, it wasn\u2019t going to win him the league title but it was something he will have learned from. And that was the thing that always struck me about Nick: constantly learning and testing things out to see if they could work.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
