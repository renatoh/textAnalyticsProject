Microsoft spent hundreds of millions on Web TV before realising that people weren't that keen to spend hours squinting at the web on their TV set. ITV Digital (n\u00e9e ONdigital) was convinced that giving people yet another set-top box to access the web was the way to take on Sky - it was wrong, of course. And who now remembers the Bush Internet TV, that design classic that would let you view less than half the pages on the web? Surprise, surprise, the idea is back, but this time it just might work. Diary has been hearing rumblings from a number of manufacturers planning to produce Freeview boxes incorporating a new web browser, which Sony is also planning to use for the PS2. Unlike earlier attempts, this will allow TV surfers to view everything they can see on their computers, including Flash animation, movie clips and sound. It will also provide viewers with a return path for the first time, for interactive voting and the like. Expect the first of these second-generation web-TV boxes to be on the shelves by Christmas. \u00b7 Freeserve's admission that its longstanding relationship with Dixons is likely to come to an end next February will come as no surprise to seasoned watchers of the ISP. The electrical retail giant has been increasingly keen to distance itself from its former offspring since it sold it to France Telecom-owned Wanadoo in 2000. What is more surprising is the amount that AOL and BT are allegedly prepared to pay to take its place as the ISP of choice in Dixons, Curry's and PC World stores. According to some insiders, the deal is unlikely to work out profitably for either company if they have to pay the amount mooted. \u00b7 Recently launched 3G network 3 - handsets still available at half price on a high street near you - stepped up its campaign to lure users from rival networks last week by slashing call prices and announcing that the phones would now work in the north. Way back in March, the company insisted that it wouldn't compete on price, but on the quality of its services. Amazing what a couple of months of worryingly low sales can do, isn't it? \u00b7 Fearsome hairy rockers Metallica have finally embraced the web, three years after they sued Napster and railed at their own fans for downloading their songs. \"We've always wanted our fans to experience our music online,\" drummer Lars Ulrich said. \"But until now, the distribution methods have not passed the kind of quality standards our fans have come to expect.\" Nothing to do with having finally woken up to the web five years too late, then? We wouldn't say that to his face, of course. \u00b7 Owen Gibson is the Guardian's new media editor"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
