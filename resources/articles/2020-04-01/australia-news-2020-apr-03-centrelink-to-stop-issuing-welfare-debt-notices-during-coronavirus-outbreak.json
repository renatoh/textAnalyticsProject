The decision, which was described as a pause on \u201ccertain debt activity\u201d, follows reporting in the Guardian that Services Australia staff were chasing welfare recipients over alleged debts last week at the height of unprecedented demand for Centrelink services with phone lines jammed, the MyGov website crashing and thousands of Australians in dole queues around the country. But despite the pause, Services Australia quietly issued a notice on Friday that it intends to use Medicare data for a data matching program to include \u201cdetecting overpayments and recovering debt\u201d. The notice raises the prospect that \u2013 although the government has abandoned sole reliance on the controversial \u201cincome-averaging\u201d method to calculate robodebts \u2013 it could now arm itself with Medicare data to continue to pursue suspected underpayments. Robert said the pause would last at least six months and allow the government to redeploy staff to process benefits claims. He confirmed that people could apply to the agency to have existing debt repayments stopped and said \u201cfraud and serious non-compliance\u201d action would continue. \u201cThe decision allows Australians to focus on their personal situation during these difficult times, and supports the government\u2019s priority to get assistance to people as quickly as possible,\u201d Robert said. The notice states that Medicare data will be used to \u201cmake sure Centrelink payments are only made to people who are entitled to those payments\u201d and \u201chelp the whole-of-government approach to identify serious and complex fraud so the integrity of payments and taxpayer expectations are met\u201d. Information that can be data-matched between Centrelink and Medicare databases are: standardised first and surname, nickname/alias standardised, gender, date of birth, address, email address, telephone number, and Medicare benefits schedule usage (date of last service). \u201cServices Australia expects to match approximately 9.8 million unique records held in its Centrelink database,\u201d it said. \u201cBased on fraud criteria, Services Australia anticipates it will examine approximately 5,000-9,000 records per year.\u201d The government faced calls to pause debt recovery as early as 20 March, given it had taken such actions swiftly during the recent bushfires crisis. But Services Australia had said only that the agency had hardship provisions available. Last week, the social services minister, Anne Ruston, told the Senate \u201cover the last few days every resource that has been available within Centrelink and all external resources that we have been able to access have been moved into the processing of the new payments\u201d. Since then, welfare recipients have sent the Guardian copies of \u201cAccounts Payable\u201d debts letters issued by Centrelink during the coronavirus crisis. One debt letter, which was issued by Services Australia on 23 March, asks the recipient to repay $6,500 and states that the amount is due on 21 April. On the same day, the MyGov website crashed due to demand so significant Robert initially attributed to a cyber attack before backtracking. Another Family Tax Benefit debt letter for $5,700 seen by the Guardian was issued on Tuesday, 31 March, one day after the government announced the jobkeeper wage subsidy program. The listed due date is 29 April. Debt recipients can ask Centrelink to pay the money back over a payment plan. The Greens senator Rachel Siewert said she was pleased the government had \u201cfinally\u201d paused welfare debt action. \u201cI was told two weeks ago in the Senate by the Minister for Social Services that debt recovery had been suspended, now two weeks later we have confirmation from Minister Robert,\u201d she said. \u201cConstituents have been contacting us with debts that were raised against them this week.\u201d But Siewert said the government should go further, by guaranteeing to suspend all debts raised under the income compliance program, widely known as robodebt. \u201cThe government has to guarantee that all robodebts are suspended including people who are on existing payment plans,\u201d she said. The Guardian revealed last week the government has been working on a secret plan to repay hundreds of thousands of Australians under the botched robodebt program. The government declined to comment on the leaked plan, citing an ongoing class action against the scheme. Services Australia has paused new debt reviews under the robodebt program, but has been continuing to finalise existing reviews, the Guardian understands. People who have welfare debts against their name can be barred from accessing advance payments, which are available to social security recipients in financial distress. Hank Jongen, a Services Australia spokesman, said the debt pause would apply to a \u201cbroad range of debt raising and recovery activities, including those connected to social security payments, Family Tax Benefit and Child Care Subsidy\u201d. \u201cActivities that will cease include referrals to external collection agencies, as well as the garnisheeing of tax refunds,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring the pause we are not asking customers to commence repaying money they owe to the agency except where it relates to fraud or serious non-compliance. \u201cAll open reviews under the online income compliance programme will also cease unless customers choose to continue their review. Customer requested reassessments and appeals on finalised reviews will also continue.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
