The reality is most trades are \u2018unfair\u2019 for a variety of reasons. Many variables inflate and decrease value; player position, age, potential, time left on contract, bidding wars between clubs, contract offers, injury history, list requirements. Player X may have a greater on-field output than Player Y, but that doesn\u2019t guarantee the \u2018trade price\u2019 will be higher. Whilst an individual trade may not necessarily be a win, it may not necessarily be a loss either as a player, draft pick or on-trading may yield a reward down the line. Trading is ultimately the act of risk assessment and calculating potential gains. The following is a breakdown of all the movements and an evaluation of the handiwork of list managers over the last two weeks. All trades are rated in an individual sense, although some trades are linked via on-trading: Tom Boyd to Western Bulldogs, GWS receive Ryan Griffen and Pick six Considering the high value of both ends of this deal, only eight years hindsight will tell who \u2018wins\u2019. In terms of current value, the Dogs now have a player who they can build a side around. It\u2019s almost a deal they had to make, as there are few lower ebbs than losing your captain and coach in a week. The Giants add short-term class and experience, but it\u2019s a wonder whether Griffen at his peak will be there when they challenge for a premiership. Pick six isn\u2019t too bad either. Western Bulldogs: 8/10 Greater Western Sydney Giants: 8.5/10 Jonathan O\u2019Rourke and pick 43 to Hawthorn, GWS Giants receive Pick 19 and Pick 40 Hawthorn\u2019s decision to trade their first-round pick for Giants midfielder Jonathan O\u2019Rourke is fraught with risk. The highly rated junior struggled with form and minor injury, but now moves into one of the best development systems in the league. If the move fails, the risk was worth it as the Hawks seek to replace an aging midfield. GWS on the other hand, are left with decent compensation which saw them eventually upgrade for pick seven. Value for Hawthorn: 7.5/10 Value for GWS: 7/10 Jeff Garlett and pick 83 to Melbourne, Carlton receive Pick 61 and 76 Regardless of off-field problems and a lack of defensive pressure, Garlett is an AFL standard small forward on offensive numbers \u2013 something Melbourne have struggled to keep on the field. On the Blues side of the coin, Garlett lost value spending too long outside the senior team. The swap of draft picks is in project player and rookie upgrade territory, something a rebuilding Carlton will find a way to utilise. Melbourne: 6.5/10 Carlton: 6/10 Joel Patfull to GWS, Brisbane receive Pick 21 The Giants receive a dual Lions best and fairest winning defender, perhaps one of the more underrated players running around outside Victoria. Experience and workrate guaranteed, GWS are able to bolster their defence. The Lions will use pick 21 for their own ends, whilst impressive youngster Justin Clarke is more than capable of filling the hole left by Patfull. A rare \u2018fair\u2019 trade. GWS: 8/10 Brisbane: 8/10 Allen Christensen to Brisbane, Geelong receive Pick 21 Brisbane\u2019s score in the last trade was related to finding the currency to net Geelong half-forward Christensen. Christensen is a classy footballer, who in recent times has been hit by injury. Added to a squad with supreme midfield and flank depth, Christensen has no excuse not to flourish in his new home when he is fit. Geelong would ultimately be disappointed with what they received, but his value was hurt by recent injury and contract status. Brisbane: 8/10 Geelong: 6/10 Dayne Beams and pick 67 to Brisbane, Collingwood receive Pick five, Pick 25 and Jack Crisp; Levi Greenwood to Collingwood, North Melbourne receive Pick 25 After nearly two weeks of haggling, Dayne Beams is now a Lion. Picks five, 25 and Jack Crisp are certainly overs, but Beams being in contract put the ball in Collingwood\u2019s court. Beams at his best is one of the top 10 midfielders in the league, so mark it down as a luxury purchase. Levi Greenwood, regardless of his excellent 2014 form, is worth the pick North received for him. He spent most of his last contract out of the team and was often stifled by other ball winners at the club, he heads to Collingwood to fill Luke Ball\u2019s role in midfield. Brisbane: 7.5/10 Collingwood: 8/10 North Melbourne: 7.5/10 Mitch Clark to Geelong, Heritier Lumumba to Melbourne, Collingwood receive Travis Varcoe All three moves in this deal depend on who gets the best out of their respective players. Mitch Clark, despite his talent has been riddled with issues since his final year at Brisbane. At 27, confidence in his body and mental health must be restored quickly for Geelong to get the best out of him. Lumumba and Varcoe, when at their best, featured in world beating teams, where their freedom from opposition scrutiny saw them become dangerous footballers. It\u2019s highly improbable they\u2019ll get that sort of freedom again, but are short term upgrades on wing/half back for both clubs. Geelong: 6.5/10 Melbourne: 6/10 Collingwood: 6/10 Rhys Stanley and pick 60 to Geelong, St Kilda receive Pick 21 Geelong\u2019s list needs evens this trade out a little. Hamish McIntosh and Nathan Vardy have been injury ravaged and the list of tall project players Stephen Wells has drafted are taking their time. Stanley played a decent amount of football and averaged six marks a game in 2014. With Mitch Clark and Tom Hawkins due to take the best defenders, Stanley would find life much easier in the Geelong forward line. That said, giving up pick 21 is nothing to sneeze at as Chris Pelchen and Ameet Bains continue their fine work of rebuilding the Saints. Geelong: 6.5/10 St Kilda: 8.5/10 Kristian Jaksch, Mark Whiley and Pick 19 to Carlton, GWS receive Pick seven Carlton fans shouldn\u2019t despair in downgrading a first round pick. List wise the decision makes sense, an able looking tall and midfielder plus a pick in the top 20 is solid business. There wasn\u2019t much currency player wise to get the move done on Carlton\u2019s end, allowing GWS to add another early first round pick. Carlton: 7.5/10 GWS: 8/10 Jonathan Giles and pick 62 to Essendon, GWS receive Pick 53 Excellent value for Essendon. Giles is an able footballer at senior level, who can go forward and kick goals. It\u2019s rare that a big man with his output moves with such a small currency involved. Essendon: 7/10 GWS: 5/10 Paddy Ryder to Port Adelaide, Essendon receive Pick 17 and Pick 37 Finally the stalemate ends. Ultimately, Port with such a young list can afford to bypass their first two picks while shooting for a flag. Ryder\u2019s value on Essendon\u2019s end is about what they received. While tall players with versatility are at a premium, Ryder\u2019s had two good seasons career while having no All Australian appearances. Two picks in the first round despite the fallout from the Asada saga is an OK return. Port Adelaide: 8/10 Essendon: 7/10 Mitch Hallahan to Gold Coast, Hawthorn receive Pick 47 and Pick 49 This is a potential mistake by the Hawks. Gold Coast pick up a mature midfielder who appears to have more potential than first thought. A purchase for peanuts. Gold Coast: 7.5/10 Hawthorn: 5/10 Adam Cooney to Essendon, Western Bulldogs receive Pick 37 There are massive questions over Cooney\u2019s durability, but he is a decent addition to any clubs midfield depth. Many times they\u2019ve fallen over when midfielders missed games over the last two years. Pick 37 isn\u2019t a bad swap for such a short term fix. Essendon: 6.5/10 Western Bulldogs 6/10 Sam Frost, Pick 40 and Pick 53 to Melbourne, GWS receive Pick 23 A versatile defender and a few picks for project players is satisfactory for Melbourne. However, giving up Pick 23 for a player who was about half an hour from being picked up for free in the pre-season draft is questionable. Melbourne: 7/10 GWS: 8/10 Shane Biggs and Pick 39 to Western Bulldogs, Sydney receive Pick 37 Dogs pick up a project player in Biggs, who held his spot in the Sydney team for a few games in 2013 only to drop back into the reserves in 2014. Little risk involved, all about the Dogs getting the potential out of him. Western Bulldogs: 6.5/10 Sydney: 6/10 Liam Jones to Carlton, Western Bulldogs receive Pick 46 Jones fills a need on the cheap for Carlton. He has potential that can be tapped, but it\u2019s all up to the Blues football department to do the rest. Carlton: 6.5/10 Western Bulldogs: 6/10 Luke Lowden, Kyle Cheney, Pick 43, Pick 47, Pick 59 to Adelaide, Hawthorn receive Pick 31, Pick 50, Pick 68 Two depth players for the Crows and a range of mid round picks. Hawks first pick moves up to 31. Adelaide: 5/10 Hawthorn 5.5/10 Pick 10 and Pick 47 to Geelong, Adelaide receive Pick 14 and Pick 35 Pick swapping sees Adelaide give up four spots in the first round to hold a strong presence in the middle of the draft. Crows recruiters must believe there\u2019s value in the pick 30 to 50 range. Free agents Jarrad Waite to North Melbourne \u2013 Key forward depth during a flag tilt. He is a risk, but other reliable tall forward Ben Brown has only played seven games. 6/10 Shaun Higgins to North Melbourne \u2013 Has outside skill and positional flexibility. Questionable contract length and injury history, but gives Brad Scott the ability to free line-breakers Shaun Atley and Luke McDonald into the midfield. 7/10 James Frawley to Hawthorn \u2013 Average recently, but over time did an exceptional job in a poor team. Impact won\u2019t be immediate, Brian Lake\u2019s replacement. 7.5/10 Nick Malceski to Gold Coast \u2013 Pick of the free agents. Proven defender slots into a young and talented side on the verge of supernova. 9/10 James Gwilt to Essendon \u2013 Had limited ability since a knee injury, but is at a bare minimum AFL standard depth. 5/10"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
