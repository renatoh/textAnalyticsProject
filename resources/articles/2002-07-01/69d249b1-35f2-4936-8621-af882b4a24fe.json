Sandy Lyle and Dave Musgrove have long been an item in the golfing sense and when Lyle was starting out and struggling financially he and \"Muzzie\" would share a motel room, so halving the cost. Later, when Lyle began to amass his millions, he bought a mansion in Surrey and on occasion would invite his caddie to stay. \"Sometimes he brought me breakfast,\" Musgrove says. \"How good is that?\" It was a great player-caddie relationship, briefly interrupted but now restored, and yesterday, when Lyle birdied the last three holes for a three-under-par 68, was a throwback to the good old days. The round was, in one sense only, reminiscent of how Lyle played on the Saturday of the 1987 Open at Muirfield when the weather in the morning was utterly vile. He ignored the howling gale and driven rain and, using only a one-iron off the tee, got round in 71. At the short 16th, as they waited for the green to clear, Sam Torrance and Jack Nicklaus caught up and Torrance asked Lyle how he was going. \"I'm one under,\" said Lyle. \"What!\" said Torrance incredulously and turned to Nicklaus, who was sitting on a bench, head in hands. \"He's one under,\" said Torrance, and Nicklaus, worn out, just shook his head sadly and muttered: \"I don't believe it.\" The average score that morning from the best golfers in the world was about 78. The headlines the next morning hailed Lyle as the \"Iron Lion\", and yesterday was much the same: he used his driver only three times and for much of the time was down to a three-iron. The round, according to Musgrove, owed something to preparation. They have a new gadget, a range-finder, which measures the distance each individual ball travels on the practice ground, so solving the problem of distance control. But it also owed something to perspiration. \"That was the old Lyle,\" said a slightly exasperated Musgrove afterwards. \"Missing greens in all the wrong places. The pin's on the right at the short 4th, so he misses it right; it's on the left at the 7th, so he misses it left; and at the 13th, where's the only place not to go? The bunker, of course, so where does he go?\" Each of those short holes was bogeyed, with the 7th being, in Lyle's words, \"the best bogey of my life\". Having missed the green left, he thinned the ball across the green into a bunker and then had to get down with both knees on the grass to play a shot where the ball was two feet beneath him. It came out to 10 feet and Lyle, thankfully, holed the bogey putt. \"Then we get to the 8th,\" said Musgrove, \"and he hits this two-iron off the tee into the rough. Now he's been striping that two-iron for three months, but all of a sudden he says: 'I can't hit it.' Just that, 'I can't hit it.' So now we're down to 13 clubs and what can we do? We've got to hit summat. So we go with the three-iron for the rest of the round.\" It served Lyle well on a day when the weather made few demands. He chugged along at level par until, at the short 16th, he hit a six-iron \"as well as he could hit it,\" said Musgrove, \"and then he started complaining because it didn't finish close enough.\" He holed from 12 feet, though, and on the 17th had a 32-footer for a birdie. \"He's having a look at it,\" said Musgrove, \"and then he says: 'This is the putt Tony Jacklin missed.' I mean, talk about positive thinking.\" Jacklin famously three-putted to lose the 1972 Open to Lee Trevino, but this one went in, and the three-iron came out again for the 18th tee. It left him a 200-yard six-iron second which came to rest four feet away. That was surely OK? \"Nah, he wasn't satisfied. He kept saying it should have kicked in closer off that bank. Some people are never satisfied.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
