Austria, Poland and Azerbaijan are the other opponents in the six-team group following this afternoon's draw in Frankfurt. Sven-Goran Eriksson's side were among a series of favourites given a relatively easy ride in the preliminary draw for the 2006 World Cup finals in Germany. France, the 1998 champions and Euro 2000 winners, were placed in European group four where their toughest rivals will be Switzerland and Ireland. Meanwhile Italy's trickiest opponents in a not-too-daunting group five were Slovenia, Scotland and Norway. The draw threw up some other interesting confrontations with the Netherlands and the Czech Republic again pitted together - as they were in both the preliminary and finals draws for Euro 2004. Germany as hosts are the only automatic qualifier and will be joined by 31 other countries for the finals which open in Munich on June 9, 2006 and end exactly one month later with the final in Berlin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
