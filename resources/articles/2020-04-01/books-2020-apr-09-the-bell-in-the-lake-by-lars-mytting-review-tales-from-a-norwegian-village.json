The first instalment in a planned trilogy, The Bell in the Lake is set in 1880 on a barren Norwegian peninsula and weaves local legends with stories of a community on the brink of modernisation. Butangen is described as being \u201ctwenty years behind its neighbouring villages, which were thirty years behind Norway\u2019s towns and cities, which were fifty years behind the rest of Europe\u201d. Rich, sinuous prose makes tangible the villagers\u2019 gritty perseverance in the face of poverty, isolation and the unpredictable climate. When a young priest and a German architect decide to demolish the dilapidated stave church, with its sonorous Sister Bells that are said to chime before impending disasters, they are met with resistance. But both men make a deep impression on 20-year-old Astrid Hekne, a descendant of the conjoined twins who generations before gave the bells their name \u2013 and who would weave pictures, \u201ctheir four arms flying\u201d, of the dreaded Skr\u00e5p\u00e5natta or Judgment Day. Quick and inquisitive, Astrid hungers for the outside world; she is not like the average Butangen girl, who will marry, bear children and return to care for the livestock \u201cwith the afterbirth still steaming behind her\u201d. But as the novel progresses, Astrid discovers that she is at the mercy of her surroundings and Butangen\u2019s unchanging community. The Bell in the Lake is based on local myths and real people, and you can sense the hours spent by the author sleuthing through old church records for material. However, Mytting\u2019s prose never collapses under the weight of his considerable research; he has seamlessly absorbed dialect words and phrases into his own vocabulary. Much of the local detail is inevitably lost in English, but translator Deborah Dawkin has gone to great lengths to create an equivalent of the rural vernacular, and the result adds wonderful texture to the translation. Although there is the occasional awkward phrase, The Bell in the Lake is a beautiful example of modern Norwegian folklore. \u2022 The Bell in the Lake by Lars Mytting, translated by Deborah Dawkin, is published by MacLehose (RRP \u00a316.99).
