An Ambedkar memorial, 30 April). The timing is very interesting. This week I received confirmation of a lecture on Ambedkar's contribution to Indian political thought that I am organising at Oxford University, to be delivered by Professor Bhikhu Parekh in the second week of June. There is certainly a need for an awareness of Ambedkar's ideas at a time when the UK is facing the challenge of incorporating ethnic minorities. Sumeet Mhaskar St Antony's College, Oxford \u2022\u2008So Simon Hoggart thinks that the \"new\" system of three points for a win in football has not made much difference in terms of goals (Simon Hoggart's week, 30 April). This method was adopted by the Football League in 1981, 30 years ago. Has Hoggart got used to the new decimal currency yet?

Chris Ainsworth Rawtenstall, Lancashire \u2022\u2008Fascinating snooker semi-final on Saturday. While everyone had expected Ding to Trump Trump (Sport, 29 April), Trump Dinged Ding. Alan Hallsworth Waterlooville, Hampshire \u2022\u2008Mary Beard's riposte to David Lammy MP is in the best tradition of our prime minister: \"Sweetie, come and visit me if you think I live in an ivory tower.\" In future will female MPs be addressed as \"Dear\", and males as \"Sweetie\" (The conversation, 30 April)? David Giles West Wratting, Cambridgeshire \u2022\u2008Dartmoor, 10.30am, 29 April: four cuckoos heard (Letters, 28 April), cyclists everywhere, walkers and runners galore, two groups of Ten Tors trainees, one man from Luxembourg, several Guardian readers and not a union flag in sight. Only things missing: the usual coach parties. Phil Page Yarner Wood, Devon"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
