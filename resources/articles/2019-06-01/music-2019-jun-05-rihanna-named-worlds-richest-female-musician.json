The singer\u2019s worth is estimated at $600m (\u00a3472m), including revenues made from her fashion and beauty lines in addition to those from her music career. In May 2019, French luxury brand LVMH confirmed it would launch Rihanna\u2019s fashion company, Fenty, making her the first woman of colour to lead an LVMH fashion house. \u201cI want to be as disruptive as possible,\u201d she told the New York Times of the venture. \u201cThe brand is not traditional.\u201d LVMH also backs Rihanna\u2019s lucrative cosmetics company, Fenty Beauty, which launched in 2017 and is worth more than \u00a33bn, from which Rihanna has earned $570m, Forbes reports. Boots recently acquired UK distribution rights for the brand. She also designs an inclusive lingerie line, Savage x Fenty, in partnership with TechStyle Fashion Group. In May, Rihanna told the New York Times that she wasn\u2019t driven by money but by her work. \u201cThe money means that I can take care of my family. The money means that I can facilitate the businesses that I want to. I can create jobs for other people. My money is not for me; it\u2019s always the thought that I can help someone else or, in the future, for if I have kids.\u201d In 2012, Rihanna founded the Clara Lionel Foundation, which supports health and education efforts in impoverished communities around the world. In February 2017, she was named humanitarian of the year by Harvard University. Forbes\u2019s list of the top five richest female musicians finds Madonna in second place ($570m), C\u00e9line Dion in third ($450m), Beyonc\u00e9 and Barbra Streisand tying in fourth ($400m) and Taylor Swift in sixth ($360m). The publication defines \u201cself-made\u201d as \u201csomeone who built a company or established a fortune on her own, rather than inheriting some or all of it\u201d \u2013 hence the Kardashian scion Kylie Jenner being named America\u2019s youngest \u201cself-made\u201d billionaire earlier this year thanks to her cosmetics brand, Kylie Cosmetics. The latest issue of Forbes magazine also names Jay-Z as the world\u2019s first billionaire rapper, claiming that the 49-year-old\u2019s empire \u201cconservatively\u201d totals $1bn after valuing his various ventures as well as any real estate and his art collection."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
