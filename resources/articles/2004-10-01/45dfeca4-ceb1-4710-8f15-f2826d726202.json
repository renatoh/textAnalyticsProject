There was also relief for Italy's coach Marcello Lippi in Parma. The former Juventus manager had looked on in frustration as his side suffered a 1-0 defeat in Slovenia on Saturday, but they appeared to be cruising to a comfortable victory against Belarus last night when Francesco Totti scored his second of the match to put Italy 3-1 ahead, and although a flurry of goals in the final 15 minutes had Lippi's side hanging on for an unconvincing 4-3 victory, Slovenia's crushing 3-0 defeat in Norway means that the Azzurri have returned to the top of Group Five. Spain suffered a disappointing evening in Lithuania where they were held to a goalless draw, but there was no such problem for Sweden who, inspired by two Henrik Larsson goals, won 4-1 in Iceland. Ruud van Nistelrooy also scored twice as Holland beat Finland 3-1. Kahveci Nihat, who had earlier missed a penalty, salvaged a point for Turkey against Denmark with a goal 20 minutes from time. The Danes had led through Jon Dahl Tomasson's first-half penalty but they were forced to play with 10 men for more than an hour when Jesper Gronkjaer was dismissed after being involved in an off-the-ball incident. But both nations have lost ground on Group Two's surprise package Albania, who retained their place at the top of the table with a 1-0 win in Kazakhstan. Two goals from Jan Koller and a superb strike from Tomas Rosicky gave the Czech Republic a 3-0 victory over Armenia . However, the night's biggest celebrations were in Luxembourg. Having ended a run of eight years without a qualification point with a draw 2-2 at home to Portugal on Saturday, Liechtenstein went one better last night when they thrashed their hosts 4-0."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
