They are likely to go to Dubai - suitably away from the limelight - with the squad flying out within three days of the conclusion of the season on May 11. Any England players involved in the European Cup final on May 15, would link up after that. Eriksson must name a provisional 30-man squad by the end of April, with the final 23 to be announced before May 21. But the Swede intends to finalise his names by the end of the Premiership season and then to put players on stand-by, to be called up if necessary, rather than sending them home if and when they are not required. That would limit the chances of a repeat of the Paul Gascoigne-type tantrum prior to France 98, when he was told that he would not be part of Glenn Hoddle's squad. Controversies also dogged Terry Venables in the build-up to Euro 96, when he was England's coach and the players' drunken antics in Hong Kong were much in the public eye. \"Our plans are still to be finalised but Dubai is one of several venues we are considering as part of our World Cup build-up,\" an FA spokesperson said yesterday. \"The squad will spend five days at their destination, with the presence of partners and wives helping to generate a relaxed atmosphere. It is an option because of its climatic conditions and it's 'on the way' to Japan. We hope to confirm our arrangements soon.\" England are due to play South Korea in Seogwipo before arriving at their tournament base of Awaji Island, Japan, in time for a second friendly, probably against Cameroon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
