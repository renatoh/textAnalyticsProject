The Tottenham striker struck the bar against Croatia on Friday and had another effort ruled out for offside, leaving the Golden Boot winner without a goal in six games for his country to equal his worst run of scoreless games at that level. Kane has scored five times in the Premier League this season, to trail the leading scorer, Chelsea\u2019s Eden Hazard, by two, but there have been suggestions he has appeared jaded after cutting short a holiday to ensure he was available for Spurs\u2019 opening match. \u201cWhen you set the standards that I\u2019ve set over the last few years and you fall a little bit below them, people are going to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just the game we are in. I\u2019m experienced enough now to know that and not to get too high or too low. \u201cI just stay focused on my job and what I need to do. In the Premier League, I\u2019m second-top goalscorer. I\u2019d like to have scored more for England recently but, as a striker, you go through spells where maybe it goes off the bar, whereas other times it comes off your heel and goes in the back of the net like in the World Cup. \u201cI don\u2019t think my game has dipped. It\u2019s been tough after the World Cup, not getting much rest, but I think I\u2019ve dealt with it well. I\u2019ve stayed fit and stayed healthy. That\u2019s my main priority at the start of the season. \u201cNow it\u2019s building on that and pushing forward over the winter period. \u201cI thought I played well against Croatia in a tough game. When you are up there, you just have to battle, hold it up, bring others into play. For me, it\u2019s just focus on my job for the team. I\u2019ll be ready to go Monday.\u201d The goalless draw in Rijeka secured England and Croatia their first point of the Nations League, though Kane anticipates a far sterner test against Spain. \u201cYou look at the way they have played over the last 10 years or so, they have set that standard,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not quite there yet in that aspect, in the way they keep the ball. We\u2019ve got different qualities. We\u2019ve got great pace in the team, great one-against-one ability, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to try to exploit when we play them. \u201cIt will be a tough game, but these are the experiences you want to be in. We\u2019ve got a good squad with young, hungry players who are ready to come in and make a difference.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
