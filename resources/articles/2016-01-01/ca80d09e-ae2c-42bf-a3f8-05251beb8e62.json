A year ago Ras Mohammed national park would have been crowded with boats above and hundreds of divers below the water, but today\u2019s visitors have the blue depths almost to themselves. After the bombing of a Russian tourist jet shortly after takeoff from nearby Sharm el-Sheikh last year, most flights to the area were cancelled and tourists have mostly stayed away. Thousands of miles away along the Mediterranean coast, Tunisian security guard Karim Sahloul surveys another idyllic beach at the resort of Sousse, which was emptied by a terrorist attack. After a lone gunman opened fire at a hotel, killing 38 mostly British holidaymakers, few have dared to come back. \u201cSousse is not like before; now it is very quiet, very dark,\u201d says Sahloul, who was hailed as a beach-front hero last summer after risking bullets to administer life-saving first aid to Briton Allison Heathcote. \u201cA lot of people are now without work, restaurants and shopping centres are closed, everyone is feeling it.\u201d His bravery, and that of other tourism workers who raced to protect visitors, earned plaudits, but it was not enough to restore the confidence of visitors or their governments, which have slapped travel warnings on countries across the Middle East and north Africa. A string of high-profile attacks, fears of more violence and official travel advisories have led to a catastrophic collapse in visitor numbers in a swath of countries across the Middle East and north Africa which had turned sun-and-sand holidays into a critical pillar of their economies. Mile after mile of empty hotels along the Sousse beachfront bear mute testimony to the shattering impact of the June attack and a March assault on tourists in the Bardo museum in Tunis, in which 21 were killed. Sahloul counts himself lucky to still have a job: \u201cThe whole city depends on the tourists. Really life is hard; there are lots of people without work.\u201d Tunisia\u2019s tourism minister, Salma Lummi, warned that the sector, which employs an estimated 400,000 people, had reached a \u201ccrisis point\u201d and that its collapse risked fuelling a vicious circle of extremism. \u201cHotels have to close and this is an important industry. One of the sources of terrorism is lack of hope. It is not the only motor of it, but it is one of the very important origins,\u201d she said. In Egypt, the decline in tourism has been slower but just as devastating. Annual visitor numbers peaked at 14 million in 2010, but then the country\u2019s revolution began in January 2011, sparking political instability that ate into tourist confidence. The numbers have never topped 10 million since and are expected to fall slightly to around nine million for the 2015 fiscal year, with the plane bombing and attacks on tourists adding to concerns about general violence. Beaches and diving sites from Dahab to Sharm el-Sheikh and Hurghada are empty or sparsely visited. The beach hotels that are still open have shut down restaurants and wings and cut back on activities and, though they are a long way from the northern Sinai base of the Isis affiliate which claimed responsibility for the bombing of the Russian plane, Cairo, Alexandria, Aswan and Luxor have also been hit hard. \u201cNow we have no leisure tourism at all, it\u2019s all conferences and business. We\u2019re suffering a lot, as we have no groups,\u201d said Ahmad Samir, assistant sales groups manager of the Marriott hotel chain in Cairo\u2019s upscale Zamalek neighbourhood. At the popular monastery of St Catherine\u2019s, beneath Mount Sinai, the Bedouin guides sit disconsolate and barely employed. Some nationalities, Americans among them, require a police escort to visit. Along the coast even the rough-and-ready beach camp huts are empty, with even Egyptians only visiting in the smallest of numbers. \u201cI had my own four-wheel drive to take tourists on excursions,\u201d says one driver now driving for another firm. \u201cI had to sell it to make ends meet.\u201d Efforts by Egypt\u2019s ministry of tourism to boost arrivals with campaigns on social media have also fallen flat, with the recent #ThisisEgypt campaign hijacked by Twitter users who lampooned the campaign by using the hashtag alongside examples of Egypt\u2019s poor human rights record. Turkey\u2019s tourism sector is bracing for a similar shock after an Isis-orchestrated suicide attack killed 10 people in the heart of Istanbul\u2019s historic Sultanahmet district, outside the Blue Mosque, this month. Most of the dead came from Germany, the country which sends the most visitors to Turkey \u2013 5.2 million last year \u2013 and cancellations are expected, worsening an already bleak year. Up to 4.5 million Russians were already expected to change holiday plans after the Turkish military shot down a Russian jet that strayed into Turkish airspace on a bombing mission over Syria, and military operations against Kurdish insurgents in the south-east have added to a sense of crisis. \u201cThings are getting worse for Turkey\u2019s tourism sector, with crisis after crisis erupting before the last one is resolved,\u201d lamented H\u00fcrriyet Daily News columnist G\u00fcnes K\u00f6m\u00fcrc\u00fcler. \u201cThe situation is so bad that we should simply accept this year as a \u2018lost year\u2019 for tourism.\u201d In Israel, and in the occupied West Bank too, where numbers were only just beginning to recover from the impact of the 2014 Gaza war, tourism is again in reverse following more than three months of almost daily violence between Israelis and Palestinians. Despite hopes by Israel to market its own Red Sea coastal resort, Eilat, to Russian tourists avoiding Egypt and Turkey, there is little evidence yet of that succeeding. \u201cWhat we see is not connected to [the 2014 Gaza war] but rather an extended, low-intensity conflict without an end,\u201d Eran Ketter, a lecturer on tourism planning, management and marketing, recently told the Israeli daily Haaretz. \u201cIt wears down the tourists and Israel\u2019s ability to launch campaigns, because it is impossible to promise that it will be over soon.\u201d When suicide bombers killed 60 people in three hotels in the Jordanian capital, Amman, tourism for the first six months of 2005 declined by $1.5bn (\u00a31bn) in a country where tourism makes up 15% of the economy. Even those countries least affected by the regional turmoil have not been spared. Morocco has had no major terrorist attack since 2011, but also remains under a shadow. The UK Foreign Office does not advise against travelling to the country, but has warned the 500,000 Britons expected to visit this year that there is \u201ca high threat from terrorism\u201d. Necessity, however, is the mother of invention. While the usual tourists stay away, some countries are attempting to look to different places to fill the gap left by absent Europeans and Americans. In Egypt the government announced this month that it would grant Chinese tourist groups visas on arrival as a way to boost visitors. For its part, Tunisia is trying to attract new tourists from Algeria to stay afloat. \u201cVisa-free arrival from China could have a positive effect,\u201d said economics analyst Angus Blair, head of the Signet Institute. \u201cThere won\u2019t be the same numbers as from Russia, but it could make up for some of the fall.\u201d This article was amended on 20 January to correct the year of the Amman suicide bombings. The original dated them to last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
