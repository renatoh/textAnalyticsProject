But then Gucci has become a fashion week hot ticket through designer Alessandro Michele\u2019s wicked skill at confusing people. The venue, a disused theatre with a shady past as a hedonistic 1980s nightclub, was not what guests might have expected from the first Paris fashion show by the most powerful brand of the moment. At a rambling post-show press conference that was very much part of the evening\u2019s theatre, Michele answered a question about the bulbs deadpan: \u201cIf you plant them, they will turn into flowers\u201d. Of the venue, he said, \u201cI mean, I wanted to do a show in Paris, but I didn\u2019t want to do it somewhere like the Louvre\u201d, with just a hint of sardonic eye-roll at the notion of staging a show in a venue so hilariously unimaginative. Gucci\u2019s arch rival Louis Vuitton will stage its show in the Louvre next week, as it does each season. Eighty-four models weaved through the theatre one by one toward the stage, where they slowly formed a technicolour cast, floodlit as if about to take a bow. Halfway through the show, a guest who had been keeping a low profile in a black trouser suit and with her gaze towards her lap, leapt from her three-down-from-Anna-Wintour seat and began to sing; it was Jane Birkin, who serenaded the crowd with her song Baby Alone in Babylone. \u201cHer presence was the presence of a poet,\u201d sighed Michele after the show. She was namechecked in Michele\u2019s show notes along with Mickey Mouse, handbag muse for the season \u2013 quite a sober reference, when you consider that last season\u2019s models carried rubberised baby dinosaurs \u2013 and Dolly Parton. Michele collects portraits and says: \u201cThe head and shoulders are the most interesting part to look at, for me.\u201d His catwalks are crowded with turbans and sunglasses, earrings and frilled collars, chest-height slogans and embellished shoulders. The model line-up mixed men in with women, none in disguise or drag yet all dressed with so little adherence to style rules \u2013 to who wears pink froth for evening and who a jacket, who has long hair or a Stetson or a rainbow of sequins \u2013 that it seems irrelevant. Which, presumably, is the point."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
