Labor and the Greens combined in the Senate on Wednesday to amend the government's bill to provide for a $400bn debt ceiling \u2013 a $100bn increase on the current level, but not the $500bn the government had sought. The amended bill will now be returned to the House of Representatives. Speaking on ABC radio, Hockey said Labor was \u201cplaying games\u201d and this could force the new government to take drastic action. \u201cWe\u2019ve inherited this mess ... there is no choice, if Labor prevents an increase to the debt limit, there is no choice to having massive cuts to government expenditure,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they want to own the cuts to the budget they will own them,\u201d Hockey said. \u201cI will not put in place a budget that has a bigger debt than the debt limit and therefore the Greens and Labor will be responsible for the very significant cuts that will need to be made.\u201d Hockey has also warned that Labor could be responsible for a US-style government shutdown if it persists with its stance on the debt ceiling, and accused Labor of \u201cplaying games\u201d because at the same time as it was opposing the increase in the debt limit it was also opposing proposed savings the government had already announced. Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen accused Hockey of \u201cconfecting\u201d a crisis. \u201cThis is a political stunt of the treasurer\u2019s own making \u2026 There is no crisis. If the treasurer is mature enough and sensible enough to work with the parliament he can get an increase to $400bn today ... nobody wants to see a stand-off and a crisis like they had in the US and we wouldn\u2019t let that happen, but the government has some responsibility here. \u201cMr Hockey can confect a crisis for political purposes if he wishes to but it is not the responsible thing for the treasurer of Australia to do.\u201d As well as ramping up the rhetoric, the government is also seeking to persuade Labor of the need to raise the ceiling. Tony Abbott said he had offered the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, a private briefing from the Treasury secretary, Martin Parkinson, on the state of the budget in order to win Labor support to increase the debt cap. The prime minister said that while he was prepared to organise the extraordinary Treasury briefing, he was not prepared to release the government\u2019s independent advice for the public or parliament to justify the rise. \u201cWhat I am offering is a full and frank briefing for the opposition by the treasury secretary Parkinson and other officials,\u201d he told the ABC\u2019s 7.30 program on Wednesday night. \u201cThis is Labor\u2019s debt and we have always been critical of Labor\u2019s addiction to debt and deficit. We want to rule a line under this. We don\u2019t ever want to go near the Parliament asking for the debt ceiling to be dealt with again.\u201d But Bowen said on Thursday that Labor did not want a confidential briefing, it wanted the government to give a full explanation to the Australian people. The government introduced the bill to increase the debt cap by $200bn after Question Time on Wednesday. But Labor is attempting to amend the increase to only $100bn, on the grounds that the Coalition has not justified such a large increase. During Question Time, Labor challenged statements by Tony Abbott that he had never opposed attempts by Labor to increase the debt cap. \u201cWhile we always opposed it, we never voted against it,\u201d Abbott told the parliament. On 7.30, Abbott argued that under Labor\u2019s pre-election fiscal outlook, the gross debt was forecast to reach $370bn. Abbott used former treasurer Wayne Swan\u2019s justification of a buffer within the debt cap of between $40 to $60bn \u201cfor safety against contingencies\u201d. But opposition treasury spokesman Chris Bowen challenged the Government to release Treasury advice which justifies the $200bn rise or return to the parliament at a later date when an increase over $400bn. \u201cI am prepared to continue sitting tonight so that you can have an increase,\u201d said Bowen. Labor\u2019s Ed Husic ridiculed the turnaround in the Coalition\u2019s attitude to the debt limit, describing it as similar to a hypnosis show at an RSL club. \u201cChange your mind when you hear the clap,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir message now doesn\u2019t match what they said before.\u201d The Greens\u2019 Adam Bandt said the government had not put forward \u201cone single argument\u201d to justify the rise. \u201cThis high-handed arrogance will not wash,\u201d said Bandt. \u201cWe are prepared to act on published information to increase the limit but we are not prepared to write a half a trillion dollar cheque.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
