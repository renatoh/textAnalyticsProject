In February Quaden\u2019s mother, Yarraka Bayles, posted a video saying: \u201cThis is what bullying does,\u201d after her son, who has dwarfism, was bullied at school. \u201cI\u2019ve just picked my son up from school, witnessed a bullying episode, rang the principal, and I want people to know, parents, educators, teachers, this is the effect that bullying has,\u201d Yarraka says in the video. In the confronting video, Quaden says: \u201cGive me a knife, I want to kill myself.\u201d But Quaden was accused of faking his distress by trolls after a fundraiser for him raised hundreds of thousands of dollars. After the attacks from anonymous trolls the little boy was supported by the actor Hugh Jackman and invited to lead Australia\u2019s Indigenous All Stars rugby league side on to the pitch for an exhibition match in Queensland. Devine retweeted the Twitter user @bubblebathgirl, who claimed Quaden was an actor whose mother posted a fake sobbing video and collected $300,000 in donations. Devine said: \u201cThat\u2019s really rotten if this was a scam. Hurts genuine bullying victims.\u201d When the Twitter user @CoffeyJPC responded by saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a crime if it is a scam. Child abuse. How could anyone parent do this?\u201d Devine replied: \u201cYep. Exactly. On the case.\u201d The ABC Media Watch host, Paul Barry, criticised Devine\u2019s post at the time and linked to a video by the factchecking website Snopes that confirmed Quaden\u2019s age. Barry said Devine should have checked the veracity of the post \u201cas any proper journalist would do, she would know that it\u2019s nonsense, and she should not be retweeting it and suggesting it might be true. Do you expect no standards from such a prominent columnist?\u201d But Devine did not delete her tweet and said: \u201cTypical of your sloppy research @therealpbarry. I never mentioned anything about age. Dishonest diversion.\u201d The statement of claim says the tweet was defamatory because it carried the imputations that Quaden had \u201cdishonestly acted out being distressed in a video to obtain money from donors\u201d and that he had dishonestly pretended to be the victim of bullying, thereby hurting genuine victims of bullying\u201d. It also implied that his mother had \u201cposted online a video of her son knowing it falsely depicted him as being distressed, to get donations\u201d and that she had \u201cdishonestly coached her son to pretend to be distressed to get donations\u201d, according to the documents lodged in the federal court on Monday. According to the statement of claim, News Corp lawyers in March refused to accept that the company had responsibility for Devine\u2019s Twitter account, saying it was \u201cself-evidently a personal account and is published by Twitter\u201d. New Corp said it would not comment on the matter. Devine has also been approached for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
