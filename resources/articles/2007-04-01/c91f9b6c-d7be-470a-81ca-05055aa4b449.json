Tesco was ordered to sell the former Co-op store, on Uxbridge Road, to a rival three years ago to increase competition. But yesterday the OFT said Tesco had not yet named a credible candidate buyer. John Fingleton, the chief executive of the OFT, said: \"Further delay risked critically undermining the credibility of the ... process and with it the integrity of the UK merger regime.\" Tesco, which has numerous stores in the area, acquired the Co-op to use as a temporary home while its own store in the town was refurbished and extended. When that development was complete Tesco moved out of the Co-op and closed it. The OFT then ordered it to be sold to another \"one-stop shop\" rival to ensure healthy competition for grocery shoppers. Tesco applied to redevelop the Co-op and earlier this year sent in the bulldozers. It is rebuilding the outlet as a smaller store and a number of other retail units. Tesco insists that it has tried to find a buyer, but that the OFT has turned down those it has put forward as they would not be direct rivals to Tesco. Tesco's legal affairs director, Lucy Neville-Rolfe, described the new inquiry as perverse and said it would create further delay and uncertainty for shoppers in Slough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
