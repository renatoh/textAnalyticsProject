Photoshopped spoof Oxo cubes with Mike Ashley's head superimposed above the legend \"laughing stock\", adverts for the team's clubcall (0800 won nothing, won nothing, won nothing) and that old standby, a viral video corruption of the subtitles for the film Downfall, have all been sent by people glorying in the club's demise. Last weekend's 6-1 drubbing by Leyton Orient has given those connoisseurs of schadenfreude new impetus and with 10 days to go before Newcastle begin their Championship campaign and with no new owner, manager or players in sight, the situation could hardly be more bleak or the barbs more cruel. It's fashionable to knock Newcastle fans. Last year in the Times after the resignation of Kevin Keegan, Matthew Syed wrote an astonishing polemic, ridiculing them as \"whining, whingeing, self-pitying, self-indulgent and deluded\". Despite the fact that his description could at times be applied to almost any football fan I know, his characterisation of the Magpies' faithful seemed to strike a chord with supporters of other clubs who waded in with an orgy of piss-taking and derision. The opportunity to mock afflicted clubs is one of the joys of being a fan and payback time is difficult not to relish but the sadistic edge to the jeering spree is getting harder to stomach. Newcastle fans do not possess uniquely contemptible qualities and trying to pin the blame on them for the club's travails in the two years since Ashley purchased the club is the ultimate red herring. Ashley has always portrayed himself as a football ing\u00e9nue and, by implication, any mistakes he made were perpetrated with the best intentions. He has had three shots at popularity \u2013 by buying the club from the Hall family and Freddy Shepherd who made millions out of it while leaving the trophy room in the same state they found it, sacking Sam Allardyce and replacing him with Kevin Keegan and that last-gasp appointment of Alan Shearer in a failed bid to stave off relegation. Each time he has squandered it. You can discount Shepherd's apologists who say the new regime's jettisoning of the former chairman was its first error, as if darkly hinting in Hilaire Belloc's words: \"And always keep a-hold of Nurse, for fear of finding something worse.\" But the goodwill Ashley stimulated with his \"man of the people\" routine ran out when he insisted on the \"continental structure\" and headhunted Dennis Wise to be its recruitment supremo. The departure of Keegan over the sale of James Milner and the arrival of Xisco instead of the manager's preferred target, Bastian Schweinsteiger, pitted fans against the board and provoked Ashley's first attempt to relieve himself of the burden of ownership. When that failed he let the club drift on under the management of Joe Kinnear, sanctioned buying Kevin Nolan, who has looked too slow for the past two seasons, and got Ryan Taylor, the epitome of a makeweight, in the deal that took Charles N'Zogbia to Wigan. When Kinnear became ill, Chris Hughton took charge for six games before Shearer was given eight games in a bold but doomed gamble to secure Premier League survival. Since then it's been back to drift, with Ashley determined not to take the rudder and potential buyers locked into a stalemated game of hardball with the vendor. In the eight weeks since Newcastle were relegated it is as if the club has been taken hostage and with 10 days to go before their Championship debut fixture against West Bromwich they are left back in the hands of Hughton, a capable coach but, after various lacklustre caretaker spells, palpably not a manager. The players they are left with are the ones for whom they paid too much, reward too handsomely and are reluctant to rack up future liabilities by either paying them off or subsidising their Premier League wages at other clubs for the duration of their contracts. In the past boards have counted on the loyalty of fans to endure all hardships but if ever a statement needed to be made, it is now. The BBC reported the fact that only three people turned up at the St James' Park megastore to buy the new canary away strip as if it was a bad sign and it might be argued that the arbitrary choice of yellow was a mitigating factor. I hope, however, that it was more a sign that enough is enough and that Ashley's relaxed approach to the club's summer of aimless meander will not go unchallenged. \"Sitting here in limbo,\" sang Jimmy Cliff, \"like a bird ain't got a song.\" Tonight's friendly against Leeds gives Newcastle fans the perfect opportunity to use their voices again and call time on the neglect that has left their club in such a parlous position."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
