Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. Let\u2019s start with a success story. \u201cI\u2019ve just finished Memento Mori by Muriel Spark,\u201d says ignicapilla, \u201cyet another recommendation from this forum and another that I\u2019ve enjoyed enormously\u201d: The thing that struck me most about the book was that the average age of the main characters is around 80 and I can\u2019t remember reading anything else that gives more than scant attention to a single character from that age group. It\u2019s only my second Muriel Spark novel (no prizes for guessing the other) but it certainly won\u2019t be the last. Constellations by Sinead Gleeson has given captainlego plenty to think about: This is part memoir, part essay collection with the unifying theme of the body, and what it is like, or what it means to live our lives through our bodies (if that makes sense). Gleeson has/had a history of quite serious illness, so the book is a reflection of her experiences in dealing with her own illnesses and at the hands of various surgeons, nurses, midwives and the Irish medical profession in general. It\u2019s a thoughtful and reflective read; at times funny, poetic and heartbreaking, but shot through with great humanity and good humour. Olga Tokarczuk\u2019s Flights (translated by Jennifer Croft) has also had JayZed looking at constellations: Flights is a fragmentary, essayistic meditation on travel, connectedness and human anatomy with no clear narrative structure. It comprises over 100 sections ranging from a couple of sentences to 30+ pages: while some of the longer sections can be read as short stories, many of the shorter sections are simply brief meditations on an aspect of travel psychology or anatomy. Tokarczuk has described this structure as a \u201cconstellation novel\u201d in which the author throws her stories into orbit, allowing the reader to form meaningful shapes from them. It makes for a challenging read, and I have to confess to finishing the novel (if indeed it is a novel) feeling that I\u2019d encountered some interesting themes and ideas among the fragments, but I hadn\u2019t quite figured out what the point was. Despite that, there was a lot to like about this. The writing is consistently good, and the book included some compelling stories (the Dutch anatomist who dissected his own amputated leg; a Polish man whose family inexplicably goes missing on a Croatian island; a retired sailor who takes a ferry out into the open seas) and explored many interesting ideas. I felt that I learned a lot from the journey, even if the destination wasn\u2019t clear to me. Maybe that was the point. Elizabeth Strout\u2019s Olive Kitteridge has enchanted allworthy: How could I have not read it before? Strout\u2019s an alchemist. How does she do it? You think you know someone and then you\u2019re shown again. So deft with just a few brush strokes and Olive herself. How brilliant is it to have a no frills, no nonsense, complex heroine who is flawed and yet we care for her. It is pure magic. Julia Boyd\u2019s Travellers in the Third Reich has fascinated Alexia_R: I think I may have first heard about this book here. If so, thank you to those of you who recommended it. I thought it was a fantastic piece of research. Utterly fascinating. She draws on material from all sorts of People travelling in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s, naturally many of them are well-off but by no means all. Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in Germany and also just in the rise of extremism and how people actually living through it see it without the benefit of hindsight. Purity is Veufveuve\u2019s first time with a Jonathan Franzen novel: I thought it was just terrific storytelling. He controls the multiple strands superbly as they weave across time and space, bringing it together beautifully at the end. (The nod to Dickens via Pip is cheeky but not entirely unearned.) My wife says I\u2019m the only person she can admit to having enjoyed this to. There\u2019s little doubt its written with a powerful male gaze but I also think the only two truly sympathetic characters are both women: Pip and Leila. Finally, NicolaVintageReads has been re-reading Persuasion and \u2013 oh my goodness: My edition has the cancelled chapter where Captain Wentworth proposes to Anne at the lodgings of Admiral Croft. Would be wonderful to know why Austen changed her mind about this chapter and decided on Captain Wentworth declaring his feelings in a letter written while Anne was in the room. The more I re-read Persuasion the more I like the cancelled chapter! That\u2019s right. There\u2019s an alternate (almost) ending. Wow. Interesting links about books and reading John F Callahan looks at decades of Ralph Ellison correspondence. The secret feminist history of Shakespeare and Company. Critics from the New York Times discuss their favourite books of the year. Bharat Tandon tries to make Henry James\u2019s Bostonians sound interesting. \u201cPrinters ink is the greater explosive,\u201d reads a sign watching over the Poetry Room at City Lights Bookstore. An encomium to a special place. He needs a bigger boat: Connor Harrison wants to get his books to Canada.
