Let\u2019s fund the NHS instead", "bodyText": "George Monbiot points out that the UK dismissed early warnings about coronavirus, spending billions on the arms industry while ignoring real threats (What does \u2018national defence\u2019 mean in a pandemic? It\u2019s no time to buy fighter jets, Journal, 8 April). This Covid-19 crisis focuses our minds on where priorities really lie; the NHS will undoubtedly emerge as a frontrunner. We need to spend on \u201cnational defence\u201d because that is a prime responsibility of government, but it should be commensurate with our national income and with the real threats facing our nation. In that light, one has to question whether spending between \u00a32bn and \u00a33bn per year (actual government figures are hard to come by) on maintaining a Trident submarine on constant nuclear deterrent patrol at sea \u2013 when the missiles are not targeted and have been at \u201cseveral days\u2019 notice to fire\u201d for over 20 years for lack of any perceived nuclear threat \u2013 is now a proper use of our rapidly vanishing national financial resources. This is on top of some \u00a360bn-plus to replace the submarines, their missiles and other assorted costs associated with Trident. Cmdr Robert Forsyth RN (Ret\u2019d) Former executive officer of a Polaris submarine and nuclear submarine commanding officer Cmdr Robert Green RN (Ret\u2019d) Former Fleet Air Arm nuclear-armed aircraft bombardier-navigator \u2022 George Monbiot deserves a prize for his article \u2013 such clear common sense. It makes it even more ludicrous that, despite spending \u00a3205bn on a new generation of nuclear weapons, the end product will not even remotely be \u201cindependent\u201d. We have to borrow from the US, on a rotating basis, the missiles on which to put our nuclear warheads. A sign of foolish national vanity? Certainly. Theft from the NHS? Inevitably. Immoral and useless? Undoubtedly. Bruce Kent Vice-president, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
