Last time I was there (1994!) it was a small village with a few cafes and guesthouses ('losmen') clustered around the water palace. You can stay in the water palace itself, and swim for free in the pools there. Lovely rice fields all round, forest behind and views to the sea to the south in the distance. Worth going to for a day trip even if you don't stay there. Oh, and as anyone will tell you, Ubud and the surrounding villages is an excellent place to catch dance performances - there's something happening nearly every night of the week there. Enjoy!
