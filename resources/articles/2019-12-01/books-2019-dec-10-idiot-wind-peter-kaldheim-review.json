Three decades ago he used one of these lockers to store all his belongings. He was broke, unemployed and homeless in the city. His life, he writes, had become \u201conly something to survive, and for that I had no one to blame but myself and my accomplices: alcohol, cocaine and a deep-seated streak of what my old Greek philosophy professor would call akrasia \u2013 a weakness of will that allows one to act against one\u2019s better judgement\u201d. Born to working-class parents in Brooklyn, he had graduated from Dartmouth. At 22, he was married to his high-school girlfriend and working as a copy editor at Harcourt Brace in New York. He dreamed of publishing his first novel by the time he was 25. But there is a rift between one\u2019s dreams and one\u2019s deeds that Kaldheim tried to bridge by staying past happy hour every evening in the West Village. His wife left him after she found out he had been cheating. He quit Harcourt and became an acquisitions editor at another publishing firm. The new job came with a pay rise that he again squandered on his drinking. He developed a taste for speed and cocaine, and resigned from his job after spectacularly failing to meet a deadline. Kaldheim landed in prison in Rikers Island after selling coke to an undercover agent. He got married again and lost his wife to a brain aneurysm during a trial separation. By the time he was homeless in his mid-30s, he was spending his nights hopping from bar to bar, drinking and \u201cfreelance dealing\u201d. When he realised he was too deep in debt to a violent drug boss, he decided to get out of the city. He abandoned all his clothes in the locker at Penn Station, fleeced a customer for cash one last time and caught a Greyhound bus to Richmond, Virginia, even as a terrible blizzard kept other New Yorkers indoors. Idiot Wind is Kaldheim\u2019s record of that escape from New York, a journey that ends, eight months and 5,000 miles later, when he finds a job at last as a cook in Montana. Along the way, he lives from one meal to the next, hitching rides across 20 state lines, hopping trains, donating blood plasma for cash, scrounging for leftovers in bins, spending countless nights in the open. He isn\u2019t shy about making his influences apparent \u2013 during stopovers, he reads Jack Kerouac\u2019s On the Road and George Orwell\u2019s Down and Out in Paris and London in public libraries \u2013 but the book is animated by Kaldheim\u2019s resolution that his dissolute days are behind him. In Richmond he meets a single mother working through her drug habit to regain custody of her daughter. He drives around a town all night in North Carolina with an heir to a property fortune relapsing from his medication. A Vietnam-era veteran reveals his battle scars to Kaldheim when he sees traffic helicopters hovering around a road accident. He hitchhikes across the Mississippi with a teenager who has run away from home after losing his mother to cancer. These encounters are not cautionary tales. To Kaldheim, they reinforce a sense of fellowship that he realises he had been hankering after in New York. Acts of both unexpected kindness and lingering bitterness offer him a conceivably headier fix: the romance of being involved, however fleetingly, in someone else\u2019s life. The people he runs into on the road are also recovering in one way or another. Wars, drugs and years of economic turmoil have simultaneously opened up and narrowed their worlds. The uncertainty is embodied in the movies they seem to like, including those by Nicholas Ray and David Lynch. Their music \u2013 Bob Dylan, ZZ Top, Rahsaan Roland Kirk \u2013 reflects back to them their self-image of being constantly at a sort of crossroads in their lives. Although it is a memoir set in the Reagan years, the milieu still feels so contemporary. We know those cheap windowless hotel rooms that come furnished with a \u201csagging bed\u201d and the \u201cobligatory four-drawer dresser, with two missing drawer-pulls and a cherrywood top whose edges were deckled black with cigarette burns\u201d. We\u2019ve noticed the \u201cfreelance dealers\u201d who wander from bar to bar looking desperate every night. Cashless, and without a place to go, we\u2019ve all spent some mornings in public libraries. For those vulnerable and stranded in the US, certain things appear to have remained unchanged. Too many of us still have to resort to the Penn Station luggage lockers. \u2022 Idiot Wind is published by Canongate (RRP \u00a314.99). To buy a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.
