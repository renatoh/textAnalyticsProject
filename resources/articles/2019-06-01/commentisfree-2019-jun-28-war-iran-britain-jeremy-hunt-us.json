Its marble columns, many still standing, were erected about 500BC when inhabitants of the British Isles were capering around in animal skins and it was Greeks who posed the biggest military threat. Donald Trump\u2019s America was a bad idea whose time had not yet come. Britain\u2019s recent history with Iran is, for the most part, shaming. Nineteenth-century imperialists and traders exploited and bullied, redrawing its borders with the Raj. British armies invaded and occupied and, in the 1920s, helped to elevate Reza Shah to the peacock throne. The ensuing era of autocratic rule sowed the seeds of the anti-western 1979 Islamic revolution. At Persepolis, graffiti left by Victorian army officers still defaces its pillars. The US has since supplanted Britain as tormentor-in-chief, but Iranians have long memories. Many would agree with Mohammad Mosaddegh who, before the 1953 Anglo-American coup that ousted him as prime minister, told the US envoy Averell Harriman: \u201cYou do not know how crafty they [the British] are. You do not know how evil they are. You do not know how they sully everything they touch.\u201d Given this bitter legacy, and its other regional blunderings, it might be assumed Britain would fight shy of further intervention. Not a bit of it. This week the US slapped unprecedented sanctions on Iran\u2019s senior leaders, suggesting diplomacy is at an end. Yet as Washington\u2019s war drums beat ever louder, a familiar sucking noise can be heard above the din. It is the sound of Britain being inexorably drawn \u2013 again \u2013 into an avoidable, calamitous Middle East war. What is truly astonishing is not that Trump and headbanger hawks such as John Bolton and Mike Pompeo are gunning for Tehran \u2013 they have been spoiling for a fight ever since they wrecked the 2015 international nuclear agreement. Nor should we be shocked at the daily escalations, provocations, insults and punishments inflicted on Iran. That\u2019s par for the course when Washington turns bellicose. What should really chill the blood of British citizens is the way their own government \u2013 and the two men who want to be the next prime minister \u2013 are creating a situation, largely undiscussed and undebated, in which Britain will have no choice but to support a Trump attack on Iran, and worse, will have little hope of avoiding direct military involvement. This senseless, heedless drift into another ill-conceived, unjustifiable and illegal conflict must surely stir alarming memories in the most complacent Tory heart. Do none of these people recall a similar made-in-America catastrophe in Iraq in 2003? Don\u2019t the Chilcot report\u2019s damning findings \u2013 that Tony Blair failed to explore all peaceful options and deliberately exaggerated the threat \u2013 ring urgent bells now? The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, supposedly the sensible Tory choice, is clinging uncomfortably to the White House bandwagon. Hunt knows full well American and Israeli claims that Iran is building a nuclear weapon are hyperbolic and disingenuous. But, he says, Britain under his leadership would \u201cstand by the United States\u201d and consider military intervention in Iran \u201con a case-by-case basis\u201d. Hunt has also made clear he accepts unproven US intelligence blaming Iran for recent attacks \u2013 indeed, he disowned a British general who questioned it. And he agrees with Trump that Iran\u2019s ill-defined \u201cdestabilising activity\u201d constitutes a casus belli. Hunt may not want war. But a British military buildup is under way on his watch, including deployments of special forces, marines, Royal Navy ships out of Bahrain and, potentially, RAF F-35 fighter jets based in Cyprus. Trump has already demanded armed patrols to protect oil tankers in the Gulf. Just where does Hunt imagine all this will lead, if and when the US starts shooting? Boris Johnson has said less about Iran, hoping perhaps not to remind people of his mishandling, when foreign secretary, of the Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe case. Yet his likely attitude to an outbreak of hostilities is no mystery. Johnson is an unabashed Trump-world groupie. He already has the president\u2019s personal backing. And his Brexit strategy, such as it is, depends on swiftly cutting a comprehensive US trade deal. If Trump turns to Britain when faced with Iranian retaliation \u2013 which would certainly have happened last week if planned US air strikes had gone ahead \u2013 arch-sycophant Johnson, like company-man Hunt, can be expected to fall tamely, even enthusiastically, into line. Will parliament or the public be consulted in a timely fashion? Not a hope! It\u2019s true the US takes ever less notice of what British leaders say \u2013 reflecting a wider problem of declining national influence. But Trump still needs moral ballast. The prospect of Britain sleepwalking into a new American war has been greatly increased by Tory-propagated delusions about the country\u2019s global status and supposed ability to \u201cpunch above its weight\u201d. Their bluff may soon be called. But it won\u2019t be Tory blaggers who pay the price. The Conservatives\u2019 Brexit obsession has also distracted attention and blurred judgment. When the foreign office minister Andrew Murrison visited Tehran this week, his tough reception should not have come as a surprise. In their talks, Seyed Abbas Araghchi, deputy foreign minister, displayed an embarrassingly accurate grasp of where post-imperial, post-Europe Britain was going wrong. \u201cIt appears that the British government\u2019s entanglement with the predicament of Brexit has prevented it from having a correct understanding of the global realities,\u201d Araghchi said acidly. Its collusion with \u201cAmerica\u2019s bully-style measures\u201d would only further harm the UK\u2019s standing. The Iranians are right. Across the Middle East, Britain is too often seen as in league with despots and murderers while its subservience to harmful American policies erodes its reputation. In Yemen, Britain is closely identified with a Trump-backed, Saudi-led war that has caused immeasurable suffering \u2013 and to what end, save further unlawful weapons sales? When it comes to Palestine, Trump\u2019s risibly biased \u201cpeace plan\u201d is destroying the international consensus favouring a viable Palestinian state \u2013 a consensus consistently supported by Britain. In Syria, commendable British humanitarian aid efforts are sabotaged by US indifference, while in Egypt a dictator receives Trump\u2019s blessing even as he scandalises universal human rights law. If Trump\u2019s hawks get their war, Britain risks being sucked in on the side of an aggressive superpower whose words and deeds are increasingly inimical to this country\u2019s interests and values. There\u2019s an old debt to be paid, and it\u2019s high time Britain finally did the right thing by Iran. That requires unhesitating, active opposition to the threat the Trump regime poses to Iranians, the wider region \u2013 and to us. \u2022 Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
