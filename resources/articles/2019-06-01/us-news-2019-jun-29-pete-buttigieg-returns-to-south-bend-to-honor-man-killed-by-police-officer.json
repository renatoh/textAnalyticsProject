It was the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s first visit to the city he runs as mayor since a contentious town hall event last weekend threw a national spotlight on the shooting, Buttigieg\u2019s record in office and his relationship with black voters. After consulting with people close to Logan\u2019s family, Buttigieg was not set to attend the funeral. He instead participated in a peace walk and a community event including faith leaders and police representatives. Logan, 54, was shot dead on 16 June, after police responded to a call about someone breaking into cars. Sgt Ryan O\u2019Neill, the officer who shot Logan, said he came at him with a knife. O\u2019Neill had not turned on his body camera. He was placed on leave. An independent prosecutor will investigate. Early in his term in office Buttigieg, 37, demoted South Bend\u2019s first black police chief. In a city that is 27% black and 15% Latino, 90% of officers are white. In Thursday night\u2019s Democratic debate, Buttigieg was asked about his failure to bring greater diversity to South Bend police. He said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t get it done\u201d. He also said he \u201ccould walk you through all of the things that we have done as a community, all of the steps that we took, from bias training to de-escalation, but it didn\u2019t save the life of Eric Logan. And when I look into his mother\u2019s eyes, I have to face the fact that nothing that I say will bring him back.\u201d The gay Afghanistan veteran and Rhodes scholar has proved to be the surprise package of the Democratic presidential primary so far, polling in the top five candidates at state and national level. The realcleapolitics.com polling average places him fifth, behind Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris. Speaking to CNN on Friday, the mayor said: \u201cThese are issues that America hasn\u2019t solved, that no city has solved, but where we\u2019ve made progress. Sometimes it\u2019s three steps forwards and two steps back. I\u2019m not going to present myself as the person who is going to resolve racial tension and racial inequality in this country. That\u2019s not the story I\u2019m telling. \u201cWhat I am saying is that we have addressed these issues in my community. We have learned from that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
