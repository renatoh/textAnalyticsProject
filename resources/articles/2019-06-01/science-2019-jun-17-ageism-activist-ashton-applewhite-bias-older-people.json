So what? That\u2019s what women the world over do, you might think: dye grey hair to hide their age. But what Applewhite did was different: she dyed her hair grey. Not Kim Kardashian-platinum grey, but defiantly uncool, bog-standard grey. \u201cI went to a matinee, so it was all old people,\u201d she says, grinning widely as she absentmindedly tousles her hair, the brown roots showing. \u201cWhen it finished, everyone left via an escalator. I looked down and there was not a grey head to be spotted. I suddenly thought: \u2018This is one way we collude, en masse, in making ourselves invisible as older women \u2013 and that\u2019s a real problem, because when people are invisible, so are the issues that affect them\u2019.\u201d When Applewhite, author of This Chair Rocks: A Manifesto Against Ageism, gave a TED talk titled Let\u2019s End Ageism in 2017, it was an unexpected hit, with 1.5m views to date. In the video, the audience gives Applewhite repeated standing ovations as she talks about how it is not the passage of time that makes it so hard to get older, it\u2019s ageism: a totally illogical prejudice that pits us against our future selves. \u201cAgeing is not a problem to be fixed or a disease to be cured,\u201d she exhorts from the TED stage, to shouts of support. \u201cIt is a natural, powerful, lifelong process that unites us all.\u201d But back to the matinee: \u201cI stood at the top of that escalator,\u201d Applewhite, now 66, says, \u201cand I thought, wouldn\u2019t it be amazing to have the year of letting our hair go grey, so the world can see how many of us there are and how beautiful we are and how diverse we are?\u201d Applewhite, who is based in New York, inherited her mother\u2019s no-grey-hair gene. But she decided that if she was going to talk the talk, she needed to walk the walk: \u201cThe big, if shallow, surprise is how much I liked having grey hair, because I didn\u2019t expect to,\u201d she says. \u201cBut other people\u2019s reactions varied. My manager at work said: \u2018You don\u2019t look older\u2019; my friend Mer said: \u2018You look older\u2019; and her husband Josh said: \u2018You look hot!\u2019\u201d \u201cBut what was most interesting was a contributor to my blog, who said: \u2018Fine for some, but my hair doesn\u2019t look good grey.\u2019 OK, no judgment, but I wonder how much of her opinion is coloured by what the grey signifies to her \u2013 because that\u2019s what we need to work on, in ourselves and in the culture: decoupling \u2018older\u2019 from \u2018undesirable\u2019 and \u2018old\u2019 from \u2018ugly\u2019.\u201d This is the elevator pitch for Applewhite\u2019s exuberant, thoughtful and surprisingly entertaining book. \u201cMy call to action skews towards the first and foundational step of confronting internalised ageism,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that is only the first step. It is clear that upending discrimination on the basis of age will require fundamental changes in the way society is structured.\u201d \u201cWe have to come up with fairer and broader ways to access productivity, devise more ways for older people to continue to contribute, support them in their endeavours and decouple the value of a human being from success along any of these metrics,\u201d she says. It is not news that the population is ageing. Life expectancy in Britain is growing by a dramatic five hours a day. Furthermore, in 2014, the average age of the UK population exceeded 40 for the first time \u2013 up from 33.9 in 1974. This is no mere blip; the trend will continue as life expectancy increases. In fact, this year marked a demographic turning point: for the first time since the early 1980s there were more people either too old or too young to work than there were of working age. The number of people in the UK aged 85 or more is expected to more than double in the next 25 years and by 2040, nearly one in seven Britons will be over 75. By 2066, 26% of the total population will be aged 65 years and over. Some 10 million of us alive in the UK are likely to live past the age of 100. But despite the overwhelming message from media and society that wrinkles are unattractive, old people are incompetent and ageing is something to be feared, research also shows that people are happiest at the beginning and the end of their lives. And despite the fear that most of us have of care homes, the vast majority of people over 65 live independently: \u201cHow come so many of us unthinkingly assume that depression, diapers, and dementia lie ahead?\u201d asks Applewhite. \u201cThat the 20th century\u2019s astonishing leap in life expectancy is a disaster in the making? Underlying all the hand-wringing is ageism: discrimination that sidelines and silences older people.\u201d Applewhite\u2019s journey from her personal experience of ageing to the political stage seems to have hit the crest of a wave: the reception of her book has been more than enthusiastic. Anne Lamott, a New York Times bestselling author, said: \u201cI never use the word empower, but this book has empowered me.\u201d Despite the acclaim, however, the prevailing message about age and ageing is, Applewhite says, uniformly negative: \u201cThere are giant, legitimate challenges individually and structurally to scaling up the support an older population will require, and to the personal fears about running out of money and ending up alone. But what never occurs to most of us is that hugely amplifying those fears and contextualising them is the culture in which we age. The story of the 80-year-old supergeezer jumping out of an aeroplane or the 50-year-old woman waylaid by early Alzheimer\u2019s is going to get a lot more readers than the true story, which is that most of us muddle along fine and continue to do everything we always did, or at least, versions of it, right to the end.\u201d Ageism, she believes, is the \u201clast socially sanctioned prejudice\u201d. \u201cRacist and sexist comments no longer get a pass, but who even blinks when old people are described as worthless, incompetent, or \u2018out of it\u2019?\u201d Suppose, she suggests, we could step off \u201cthe treadmill of age denial and begin to see how ageism segregates and diminishes our prospects\u201d? \u201cUntil then,\u201d she says, \u201cageism will pit us against each other: it will rob society of an immense accrual of knowledge and experience; and it will poison our futures by framing longer, healthier lives as problems instead of the remarkable achievements and opportunities they represent.\u201d So how to counter ageism? Applewhite is clear about where we all need to start: \u201cThe first and most essential step is to look at our own attitudes towards age and ageing because most bias is unconscious and we can\u2019t challenge bias without thinking about it. All change starts within.\u201d Don\u2019t compliment an older person by telling her she is different \u2013 fitter, stronger, more stylish \u2013 than other people her age, she says. Watch out for sanitised or romanticised views of ageing: sexless, placid depictions of older people on a cruise or playing the token wise elder: \u201cIdealised depictions of later life distract from the real challenges of ageing and the need to confront them.\u201d Don\u2019t use adjectives for older people that you wouldn\u2019t use for younger ones, like feisty and kindly. Try active, opinionated and kind instead: \u201cChildren are little \u2013 their grandparents are not,\u201d she says. Above all, \u201cwe must be proud of our age,\u201d she says. \u201cAge pride is for everyone who refuses to regret waking up a day older, who acknowledges long life as the privilege it is, and who is prepared to challenge the power structures that underlie all discrimination.\u201d This Chair Rocks: A Manifesto Against Ageism by Ashton Applewhite is published by Melville House UK for (\u00a312.99).
