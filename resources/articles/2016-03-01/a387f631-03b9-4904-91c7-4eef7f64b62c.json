Hundreds of protesters were stranded outside the venue, and they faced off with a handful of Trump supporters. The campaign used only EventBrite to issue tickets and, despite the crowds, was still making those tickets available until the event was scheduled to start. In a venue that can only accommodate 1,200 people, that meant hundreds were forced to stand in the rain for more than 90 minutes, just to catch a glimpse of the Republican frontrunner. It was, even in the spring rain, a recipe for tense confrontations: while some left early, wet and disappointed, the true diehards and their very committed opponents were there as Trump arrived. They stayed, waiting for him to leave. The police had marked off a staging area for protesters opposite the east entrance of the venue \u2013 Trump went in through the north, press through the south. It was directly opposite an awning many would-be participants used to shelter from the intermittent rain. Under the awning, two men held up a banner reading \u201cTHE SILENT MAJORITY IS PISSED!\u201d A large Donald Trump impersonator posed for pictures. Then a yell went up as the motorcade was spotted and bedraggled fans rushed north, slipping in the mud and jostling for position. \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201d some young men shouted, as people held cellphones and selfie sticks over the heads of the crowd and \u201cThe Donald\u201d, as one older lady called him, waved at his fans before walking inside. Some more headed for their cars, while others retreated to the east entrance wait it out. The real fans stayed, in the rain, around the north entrance, only to eventually be shooed off by police as Trump\u2019s speech was ending. Vendors selling both Trump-specific and general conservative swag worked the scene. \u201cOh, we\u2019re local vendors,\u201d one older man said. \u201cWe offered him a donation, but he said he don\u2019t want our money, just asked for our votes. \u201cHe don\u2019t need my money, anyway.\u201d As soon as the \u201cSilent Majority\u201d guys rolled up their banner and left, they were replaced by vendors hawking more T-shirts, buttons, flags and signs \u2013 none sanctioned by or benefiting the candidate. The vendors, including an African American man with gold teeth and a large white man with a shaved head and two gauges in each ear, exhorted the crowd not to leave without a souvenir. Meanwhile, a short, middle-aged woman with a red and white golf umbrella followed a white woman in a hoodie, a white man in a blue T-shirt and duck camouflage cap (a popular Ohio print) and a black man with short dreads around the covered area. Eventually, as they left, the umbrella carrier shouted to the other woman: \u201cYeah, you better put your hoodie up!\u201d The middle-aged woman was one of several roving Trump supporters milling around apparently looking to start trouble. Protesters didn\u2019t exactly stay in their designated area, and, as police and secret service agents guarded the entrances and some people listened to a livestream of the speech on their cellphones, the two groups began mingling and exchanging insults. In the designated protest area, a group of young people suddenly started yelling \u201cDump Trump!\u201d at passersby, who sometimes responded with insults. \u201cFuck you, you commie! Go back to Africa!\u201d yelled one man at the most vociferous protester \u2013 who didn\u2019t exactly appear to be of recent African extraction. \u201cFuck you \u2013 you\u2019re the one voting for a commie!\u201d he yelled back. A group of very young men in American flag-themed clothes walked towards the protest area and started blowing an air horn, earning jeers from the protesters. The woman with the red and white umbrella pointed at the kids and laughed. A small, middle-aged man started jumping up and down, waving his fists at the protesters from 20ft behind the awning. \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201d he screamed. The protesters shrugged their shoulders. Suddenly, a middle-aged lady in a pink T-shirt, with a piece of wet neon pink poster board reading \u201cTrump is Hitler\u201d on one side and \u201cHillary Clinton 2016\u201d on the other, walked into the crowd of Trump supporters and began yelling at another middle-aged woman, both in English and Spanish, about Trump being a fascist. She was quickly surrounded by Trump fans, waving flags and umbrellas and shouting: \u201cUSA, USA, USA.\u201d Soon, she was surrounded on all sides by Trump supporters jostling each other and snickering at one another, sometimes chanting. A man began to record her, laughing. \u201cHillary\u2019s a murderer,\u201d someone shouted. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d she said. \u201cNo one wants to touch you!\u201d a young man yelled. \u201cMaybe if someone did, you wouldn\u2019t be here!\u201d yelled another. \u201cBuild the wall! Build the wall!\u201d the crowd chanted. \u201cHillary kills babies!\u201d yelled another woman. As a police officer finally came up to try to get her to move to the designated protest area, the crowded cheered. \u201cIt\u2019s our party,\u201d another guy said, \u201cGo back to yours over there.\u201d As Trump\u2019s speech, barely audible from people\u2019s cellphone speakers, seemed to be wrapping up, the officers guarding the doors moved to shoo people off. \u201cWe need you guys to get off the property,\u201d one said. \u201cYou can be on the sidewalk, don\u2019t block traffic, but we can\u2019t have you here right now.\u201d Slowly, in the drizzle, the Trump fans walked back to their cars, some pausing only momentarily to heckle the protesters on the way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
