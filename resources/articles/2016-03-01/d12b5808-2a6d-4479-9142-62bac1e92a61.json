The attacking midfielder\u2019s career has stalled at Bayern Munich, where he has made only 12 appearances this season, and he is keen on a move away from the Allianz Arena despite the impending arrival of Carlo Ancelotti as Pep Guardiola\u2019s replacement. Bayern want almost \u00a330m for the player they signed from Borussia Dortmund in 2013 but Liverpool hope a deal can be agreed for \u00a315m-\u00a320m. That valuation is based on G\u00f6tze having only 12 months remaining on his Bayern contract at the end of this season and his reluctance to sign an extension. Arsenal are also interested in the player who scored Germany\u2019s winning goal in the 2014 World Cup final but the attraction of working with Klopp for a second time has given Liverpool a significant advantage. G\u00f6tze enjoyed the finest period of his career for Klopp at Dortmund, scoring 22 goals in 83 Bundesliga appearances and playing a key role in the club\u2019s two Bundesliga titles, one German Cup success and progress to the 2013 Champions League final. The combination of a fresh start away from Bayern plus renewing acquaintances with Klopp is believed to appeal to the Germany international, who has found opportunities limited under Guardiola and struggled with injuries during his time in Bavaria. The change of manager at Bayern this summer has not altered the player\u2019s opinion. Klopp knows his former Dortmund charge is ideally suited to the gegenpressing style he wants at Anfield and is using his contacts in Germany for the first summer transfer window of his Anfield reign. The Liverpool manager played an influential role in persuading the Cameroon international defender Jo\u00ebl Matip to leave Schalke for Merseyside when his contract expires at the Bundesliga club this summer. Liverpool have also signed the highly rated Red Star Belgrade playmaker Marko Grujic for next season although, at 19 years of age, the \u00a35.1m recruit will need time to adapt to the Premier League. G\u00f6tze\u2019s arrival would represent a far bigger coup for Liverpool and Klopp, however, despite his recent difficulties with the Bundesliga champions. His ability to operate across the frontline is an added attraction for the Liverpool manager as he seeks to strengthen in the summer, with inherent, expensive signings such as \u00a332.5m Christian Benteke expected to make way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
