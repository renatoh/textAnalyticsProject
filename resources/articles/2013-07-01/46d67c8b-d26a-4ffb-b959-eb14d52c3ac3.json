In the past six majors he has done that only at the Masters when he finished fourth. 2013 US Open: Par 70 Weekend 76, 74 2013 Masters: Par 72 Weekend 70, 70 2012 US PGA: Par 72 Weekend 74, 72 2012 Open: Par 70 Weekend 70, 73 2012 US Open: Par 70 Weekend 75, 73 2012 Masters: Par 72 Weekend 72, 74 Magic moment Bubba Watson's approach at the 9th, drawing the ball in to nestle several feet from the flag, was a contender before Robert Garrigus holed the shot of the tournament on the 15th. Putting from way off the front of the green, at a hole Henrik Stenson had suggested could even see the odd four-putt, Garrigus barely tapped the ball when he struck it. Then he watched as it gathered pace for maybe 60ft before dropping in. One to watch Henrik Stenson Two under par With a second consecutive 70, the 37-year-old, who was third at Birkdale in 2008, is in contention for his first major going into the weekend. Stenson, who lost to Phil Mickelson in a play-off at the Scottish Open, bounced around the scoreboard on Friday, making up for a pair of bogeys with two birdies on the back nine. Strop of the day On day one Charl Schwartzel was so infuriated by his attempt to play out of the rough that he sent his club flying after the ball. Phil Mickelson's reaction at the 6th on Friday was tame by comparison. Having swiped his ball into the rough he could not contain himself. \"For crying out loud,\" he yelled, slumping, wincing and scrunching up his face. His round did get better, though.
