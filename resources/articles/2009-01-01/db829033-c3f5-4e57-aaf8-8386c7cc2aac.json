The scrum-half had been relatively quiet until the 65th minute when, with the Sharks trailing 17-16, he scooped up a Clermont turnover on the halfway line and sprinted clear down the blind side, slowing only to step inside a sole covering defender. Sale added a third try from David Tait, a young No8 who outplayed the better-known Mathew. The latter was replaced by Richard Wigglesworth early in the second half after an unconvincing performance \u2013 hardly the best way to prepare for his departure for Portugal tomorrow with team-mates Mark Cueto, Andrew Sheridan and the rest of the England squad. Sale leapfrogged Clermont to finish second in the group behind Munster, whose game in Montauban had been postponed because of bad weather. There were no such problems at a balmy and almost spring-like Stockport, although that is unlikely to make Sale's director of rugby, Philippe Saint-Andre, regret the decision he is expected to announce on Monday. It has been widely reported in the French press that Saint-Andre is to join the rugby madhouse of Toulon, replacing the former All Blacks captain Tana Umaga, with the chequebook of the seriously wealthy Mourad Boudjellal to flourish. That could mean more problems for Sale, who already know that their cult hero S\u00e9bastien Chabal will be following Saint-Andre back to France and fear that the likes of S\u00e9bastien Bruno and Luke McAlister could also be tempted by Toulon Both teams made a host of changes here, Sale choosing to rest key men such as Charlie Hodgson and Chabal after their hopes of qualification were shattered by last Friday's mauling in Munster. Clermont's relaxed attitude was more intriguing and suggested that they regarded their own chances of making the last eight as little more than mathematical. It made for some easy-on-the-eye if less than intense early exchanges, with Clermont's big Fijian wing Napolioni Vonowale Nalaga offering the first hint of a difficult afternoon for the Sale backs when he bumped off Mark Cueto and Mathew Tait in his first run. McAlister, who moved inside to stand-off in the absence of Hodgson, replied with a moment of class for Sale, before Tait was again found wanting in defence by Thomas Combezou. It was a surprise that it took 10 minutes for Sale to open the scoring, with McAlister sucking in the defence for Luke Abraham to send Oriol Ripol over on the left, McAlister converting for a 7-0 lead.But Clermont replied with a penalty from Seremaia Bai, another Fijian, and then nudged ahead when Combezou touched down Anthony Floch's left-footed grubber. McAlister brought Sale level again with a penalty which also cost Clermont's captain, Thibaut Privat, a trip to the sin bin for killing the ball. But even with 14 men the French regained the lead with a try from another Floch kick. This time Nalaga applied a powerful finishing touch, with Cueto and Ripol left trailing in his wake. McAlister pulled a penalty back for Sale to cut their half-time deficit to 17-13 and reduced the arrears to a single point midway through the second half. That kick came shortly after his first miss of the afternoon, for an offence that saw Combezou become the second Clermont player sent to the sin bin, in his case for a dangerous lifting tackle. Combezou was still off the field when Peel made his decisive intervention \u2013 a score that will provoke plenty of debate in Wales."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
