They were losing 3-2 with two minutes of normal time remaining. Yet in a finish as wild as it was improbable, the US pulled off their first ever win over Holland. J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann famously likes to set his players stiff challenges. But with another friendly against Germany coming up next week, sending a roster missing many key names to face two of Europe\u2019s top teams seemed to be courting the risk of severe embarrassment. On Friday at the Amsterdam Arena, though, it was Guus Hiddink\u2019s side that was left looking foolish. While the US back line was repeatedly breached by a home side that ought to have scored at least twice more, the visitors did not cave and produced a spirited second-half comeback that exposed the Dutch defence as lackadaisical and disorganised. If at times their attacking play was almost irresistible, even without the injured Arjen Robben, at the other end of the field the Netherlands looked every inch a nation that is languishing in third place in their Euro 2016 qualifying group, five points adrift of second-placed Iceland. Revitalised by late substitutions and some unlikely heroes, the US took advantage and will be in buoyant mood for the exhibition against Germany in Cologne on 10 June, and, surely, their defence of the Concacaf Gold Cup, which starts next month on home soil. As the head coach ponders his options for that tournament, several fringe players enhanced their reputations while the team as a whole showed a stubborn streak that helped compensate for some tactical and technical deficiencies. Though Klinsmann was without the likes of Clint Dempsey, Jozy Altidore, Geoff Cameron and Omar Gonzalez, there was little indication in the early stages that the US would be overmatched by the side that finished third in last year\u2019s World Cup. Michael Bradley hit the post with a shot from the edge of the box after 19 minutes, then Brek Shea found space on the left but aimed his effort too close to goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen. The warning signs for the US were evident though, with orange-clad forwards afforded too much space on almost every attack. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar duly gave the Netherlands the lead after 27 minutes, heading past Brad Guzan after defenders John Brooks and Ventura Alvarado failed to track him tightly enough. The advantage was short lived, as Fabian Johnson\u2019s 34th-minute cross from the right found Gyasi Zardes arriving at the far post, and his surprisingly powerful right-footed stab at the ball squeezed past the goalkeeper. The 23-year-old Los Angeles Galaxy forward\u2019s celebration was strangely low-key, as if he scored goals at this level all the time, but it was his first goal for USA on his sixth appearance. Perhaps the reaction was an attempt to show that performing on a high-profile stage does not faze him. His lively overall display indicated that might well be true. While the US looked promising going forward, the quality of defending was a worry, albeit against such accomplished players as Memphis Depay, Robin van Persie and Huntelaar. Holland pushed hard to regain the lead in the early stages of the second period and Klinsmann\u2019s side cracked within four minutes. Huntelaar scored again with his head, powering the ball high through Guzan\u2019s outstretched arms. After 53 minutes he claimed a hat-trick, crushing a shot from distance that deflected off Depay and went in off the post. But Depay\u2019s inadvertent contribution was so significant that it seemed likely the strike would be credited to Manchester United\u2019s new signing. At this point it seemed probable that the Dutch would go on to burnish the scoreline even farther. But they did not so much take their foot off the gas as apply the handbrake, turn off the engine and throw the key out of the window. The US were rewarded for their persistence with a 70th-minute breakaway goal for John Brooks\u2013- an easy finish to cap a sharp team move, and his first for his country since the fondly-recalled 86th-minute winner against Ghana in Brazil almost a year ago. It prompted a ridiculously open final phase. Cillessen thwarted substitutes Bobby Wood and Jordan Morris, the Stanford University student, before Reading\u2019s Danny Williams claimed his first international goal in the 88th minute via a deflection off Luuk de Jong. Seconds after the restart the PSV Eindhoven forward forced a great save from Guzan with a header, then hit the woodwork on the rebound. The drama was not done, as Morris crossed for Wood, alone in the six-yard box, who scored the winner from close range."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
