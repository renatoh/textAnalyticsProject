It is the coolest portrayal of a computer hacker, and one that gets only more seductive as the film rolls on and Neo becomes the sci-fi superhero every hacker secretly wants to be. The reality of computer hacking, however, is a lot less glamourous and it can be illegal to break into a computer without authorised access, leading to not-so-cool consequences if you upset the wrong people. Last year, British hacker Gary McKinnon - also known as Solo - faced extradition to the US for tapping his way into America's department of defense, Nasa and other top-level secure computers, costing the US an estimated $1m (\u00a3572,000) in tracking and correcting his hacks. But if remotely breaking into high-security computer systems still appeals to your inner racketeer, there is an alternative that will keep you in line with the law. Ethical hacking, the controlled staging of a hacker attack against a corporate network to reveal weaknesses in its security, has become a viable career option for many IT enthusiasts. Also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking, it is increasingly being employed by security-savvy organisations. \"It's not going away; in fact, it's escalating,\" says Kris Raven, sales and marketing director at 7Safe, an information security consultancy that trains government, police and IT professionals in crime prevention and ethical hacking. \"Anyone interested in IT should make sure that information security training is part of their learning programme.\" 7Safe's courses teach a potential penetration tester how to find loopholes in a company's security and patch them up by, for example, preventing a denial-of-service attack on a computer network, which can cost dearly in damage and lost business. In 2004, the police estimated that hacking cost the UK economy \u00a32.4bn. The 7Safe courses, many of which have been accredited by the University of Glamorgan as part of a postgraduate certificate in penetration testing and information security, also award an industry-recognised CSTA (Certified Security Testing Associate) certificate and can be used as masters-level course credits. Such graduate training programmes are increasingly popular as this previously shunned element of IT security grows in recognition among big business and the government. The Department of Trade and Industry, for example, has approved the creation of an Institute of Information Security Professionals (IISP), which aims to standardise the profession and bring it on par with respected occupations such as accountancy and law. \"The courses let employers know these hackers are on the right side,\" says Raven, who confirms that all students must pass a security check against a criminal or terrorist background. The software company Oracle, which has recognised that ethical hacking is an important tool in the arsenal of its business IT managers, is also wary of employing less savoury types. Matt Moore, Oracle's security assessment manager and himself a white-hat hacker, warns: \"I wouldn't employ anyone who had a background in unethical hacking - absolutely not.\" So, how to get a job as a hacker without first trying the less legitimate routes? \"Try to get some practical experience in the field before applying for jobs - for example, a summer job working for an IT security company,\" Moore advises. \"Being able to demonstrate a passion for IT security in general is also important. It's really [about] having an in-depth knowledge of computers, how they work and how they interact. If you have such knowledge, you can use it as you wish.\" In other words, go down the unethical hacking route if you will, but there's legal money and job security to be had by helping prevent such underhand tech tactics. Check company websites for ethical hacking job advertisements or use the services of specialist recruitment firms, such as Barclay Simpson and Alderbridge. Moore's personal background is similar to that of many ethical hackers. He had enjoyed playing with computers since he was a child - \"taking them to bits and putting them back together again\" - and later began working in IT. However, you do not necessarily need a formal computer science qualification. \"You get people with a wide variety of backgrounds,\" says Moore, who studied modern languages at university, and knows other hackers who graduated in subjects as diverse as chemistry, media studies and atomic physics. \"It suits people who are methodical,\" he says. \"There is a fair degree of patience required, especially when it comes to testing software. It's very challenging.\" \"Almost a certain obsessiveness is required,\" adds Duncan Harris, Oracle's senior director of security assurance, dryly. The popular image of a hacker is an antisocial nerd who prefers the company of computers to real-world human interaction. But the increasingly positive reputation of ethical hacking is helping to change the image to a socially acceptable job choice of which your parents could be proud. \"A lot of software vendors, such as Oracle, Microsoft and IBM, employ ethical hackers,\" Harris says. \"We may not all be prepared to admit to it, but a number of companies do employ them. They may give these staff another name, but they are ethical hackers.\" Furthermore, the varied job skills that ethical hacking trains you for could boost your career in the future. \"There has been a dramatic change in some of the styles of testing that Oracle has performed over the years,\" says Harris. \"Most of the testing we had done before was what I call positive testing - checking the product worked correctly. A lot of the ethical hackers have pointed us to more negative testing. It's a bit like lateral thinking - trying to defeat the computer system.\" Such lateral thinking means ethical hackers have to consider and analyse different points of view, understanding how a successful business and its employees work, as well as a computer: you have to think like a hacker to defeat one. One trick employed by black-hat, or unethical, hackers is \"social engineering\", whereby hackers pose as IT staff in order to trick unsuspecting workers into disclosing their username and password. So, call it what you will - ethical hacking is a realistic career option for any graduate with a love of all things cyberspace. \"As long as computer programmers write software programs that will never be 100% security-bug free,\" says Harris, \"there is going to be a need for ethical hackers.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
