Eddie Jones is expected to endorse the Northampton hooker despite Hartley having spent more than a year of his career serving suspensions but Haskell says the player he has known since they were in the same England Under-19s team commands the respect of his international team-mates. \u201cDylan is a good man,\u201d Haskell said. \u201cHe is abrasive, which is what you want, and he is committed in everything he does. He will lead by example and his passion for the shirt is renowned. I love Dyls and he is a good friend of mine. You pick players to do a job and I am not particularly conformist myself. \u201cIf you are the best guy for the job, you play; your track record does not matter. There might be a few people with stiff collars who will get a little bit upset but that is the nature of the game and I do not worry too much about people\u2019s opinions. You live and die by the sword: Dyls is a good man, a good player, gives 100% and I could not care less what he has done before.\u201d Wasps have made the quarter-finals of the European Cup many times but they were not fancied to top a group made up of former winners. Their second thumping victory over Leinster, the Irish province\u2019s heaviest defeat in the tournament, followed emphatic victories over Toulon and Bath while their two defeats were both to last-minute tries. Leinster were a match for them for the first 40 minutes but as soon as play broke up, Wasps flew away. Five of their seven tries came in the second period and they scored 39 unanswered points to condemn Leinster, the last team to take home the trophy before Toulon took a liking to it, to the bottom place in the group. \u201cI am not one usually given to celebrating victories because I move on to the next thing pretty quickly but I will enjoy this the best I can,\u201d Haskell said. \u201cAs a win it ranks right up there. Everything went right for us. We focused on one game at a time rather than looked at the bigger picture and that helped take us to where we wanted to be. I was hungry to work at my game after the World Cup, realising I was not playing as I wanted to, and being captain at Wasps gets the best out of me.\u201d Leinster, who opened the scoring with a try after two minutes, were not helped when their fly-half, Jonathan Sexton, captaining the side on his 100th appearance, left the field on nine minutes after a clash of heads with his former team-mate, Brendan Macken. He will have to follow return-to-play protocols before Ireland\u2019s Six Nations opener against Wales one year after returning from a long layoff following a series of concussions. Wasps had already lost their scrum-half Joe Simpson, who injured his ankle after landing awkwardly as he went for a high ball, but his replacement, Dan Robson, was his side\u2019s most influential player, involved in their first three tries and quick to spot opportunities. He set up the best try of the match, combining with his half-back partner Jimmy Gopperth from a scrum on halfway to free Elliot Daly who had too much pace for the covering defence. Daly\u2019s all-round contribution will give the England coach, Eddie Jones, something to ponder as he considers his three-quarter line for Murrayfield. \u201cElliot is pushing to play against Scotland,\u201d Haskell said. \u201cLike every player, he can improve in certain areas but he is one of the best outside-centres in the country for me. He is the life and soul of our team, a giant child who plays practical jokes on everyone. He has a lot of experience for a young player and he is talking a lot more now on the field. As captain, that is what you want.\u201d Wasps Piutau; Bassett, Daly (Miller, 65), Macken, Halai; Gopperth (Jackson, 65), Simpson (Robson, 5); Mullan (Bristow, 65), Shervington (Johnson, 62), Cittadini (Cooper-Woolley, 62), Launchbury (Gaskell, 63), Davies, Haskell (capt), Smith, Jones (Hughes, 62).
