To be host broadcaster for the biggest event in the world is the ultimate prize in television sport and the prospect of record audiences for its coverage a delicious certainty - whatever havoc digital switchover will have caused to traditional mass audiences by then. So the BBC's new director of sport, Roger Mosey - formerly of the Today programme, Radio 5 Live and currently television news supremo - couldn't be taking over at a better time despite the cloud of an enforced move to Manchester hanging over his department. In addition to the glittering prize of a home Olympics, Mosey inherits a considerable portfolio of rights, thanks in part to the pro-sport regime of ex-director general Greg Dyke, including the FA Cup, Six Nations Rugby, Premiership highlights, Wimbledon, the Grand National, the Derby and the Open. The loss of the Boat Race to ITV this year was a mild embarrassment but caused hardly a dent in the BBC's formidable armoury of sports deals. This is how it should be. With Sky's buying power in the pay-TV market now a fact of broadcasting life and audiences fracturing further as multi-channel grows, making major live sport available to everyone free-to-air must be a core part of public service broadcasting. National and international sports events are a crucial part of our social glue as a nation and with the build-up to the London Olympics, interest in sport will increase as the games inspire more people to get involved as participants and spectators. The exception to this happy scene is cricket. It is not part of the Olympics and from next year the best of the game, the live Test matches, will not be available free-to-air for the first time in living memory. With last year's series win over the West Indies, and an Ashes victory over the Australians this summer a real prospect, interest in the game has reached new heights. Channel 4's lively reinterpretation of the rules of cricket coverage has also brought new and younger viewers to the game. But when its live coverage of the Ashes series against the Australians finishes, all live Test matches will move to Sky and the free-to-air viewer will have only the crumbs of recorded highlights on Five to look forward to. This has happened in part because the Test has been relegated from the top league of so-called listed events - the crown jewels of sports fixtures that must be made available to the public service broadcasters for universal coverage. Test cricket now appears in a subsidiary group of events that may be sold for pay-TV as long as highlights appear on one of the main terrestrial channels. On one level I have no problem with the sports rights market working in this way: Sky outbid both the BBC and Channel 4 fair and square to secure the rights. But there is a nagging sense on this deal that Test cricket was lost to free-to-air television as much through neglect on the part of the public service broadcasters as because of Sky's financial muscle. When Channel 4 won the live Test rights in 1998, it caused shock waves at the BBC, which had practically invented television coverage of the game. But Channel 4 proved a worthy successor, introducing innovations that thrilled traditional fans and attracted new viewers. However, five-day cricket matches are difficult for a single commercially funded channel to accommodate without disrupting the rest of the schedule, and with a new management at Channel 4 there emerged a sense that the game wasn't quite so secure in its new home. And so it has proved. The BBC meanwhile, rich with cash from its inflation-plus licence fee, had invested heavily in football and international rugby. And, having been spurned seven years before, the corporation had lost some enthusiasm for the cost and the awkward scheduling needs of live cricket. Sky - previously partner with Channel 4 for the England Test rights - moved in for the kill. Today's rights market - notwithstanding the public service legacy of the listing system - is a cut-throat place and those who bid big, win big. But I believe both the sport and the BBC will come to regret the loss of the game to pay-TV. In common with many fans, I hope that when the rights come round again, the BBC can swallow its pride, dig deep into its relatively capacious pockets and restore Britain's second national sport to its rightful place on the air: free and available to all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
