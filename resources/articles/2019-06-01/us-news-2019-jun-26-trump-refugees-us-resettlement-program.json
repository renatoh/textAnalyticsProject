After eight years in an Ethiopian refugee camp, he resettled in Idaho in 2012, learning at an airport in Florida that instead of being sent to Texas, as originally planned, he was being moved to what was then a mysterious place. \u201cPeople were saying \u2018Tecle, you can say no, this is America, you have freedom\u2019 because everyone was shocked and nobody had heard of this secret state [Idaho],\u201d Gebremicheal said. He didn\u2019t want to cause trouble and went with the plan, setting three big goals for himself in his new home, all of which he has accomplished: returning to school, buying a home and serving the community which accepted him by working in the state house. \u201cI have come to the decision, it [Boise] is the best place for refugees,\u201d said Gebremicheal, who announced in May he is running for city council in Boise. His is just one story about the life-changing power of the US refugee resettlement program \u2013 a program which has never been in such jeopardy. Donald Trump has for two consecutive years overseen the lowest refugee admission rates since the modern resettlement system was created in 1980. Since October, the US has admitted just 14,808 refugees and is projected to have allowed in just 22,000 before the end of the fiscal year in September. In fiscal year 2018, it admitted 22,491 people. Those shrinking numbers represent more separated families and more countries able to justify lowering their own resettlement numbers. In human terms it simply means fewer Tecles in the US. Trump\u2019s war on refugees is no secret. He paused the refugee resettlement program a week after taking office and repeatedly tells lies that refugees have been tied to terrorist attacks, even though none of the more than 3 million refugees resettled since 1980 have committed a lethal terrorist attack. The White House adviser Stephen Miller reportedly said he wanted to end all refugee resettlement in the US and has suppressed government studies that show the economic benefits of refugee resettlement. The executive branch wields immense power in determining each year how many refugees will be resettled in the US during the fiscal year, which begins in October and ends in September of the following year. The current ceiling is 30,000 people \u2013 which is equivalent to 0.009% of the US population and is the lowest ceiling since the modern program began. Bob Carey, who led the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) under Barack Obama, warned that what is happening to the program under Trump is dramatically different from what happened under the past six administrations, Republican and Democrat. \u201cIt is ideologically driven by some people in this administration who are against immigration in any way, shape or form,\u201d Carey said. No person immigrating to the US faces more scrutiny than a refugee. Trump\u2019s own national security agencies have ruled that the system for deciding who is let in has been made as secure as it can be. People close to the program said the opposition to refugee resettlement in the federal government originates from a small group of people. And the many who do support the program have been marginalized, ignored or left their jobs. \u201cYou have seen pushback from some quarters, otherwise there would be no program,\u201d Carey said. Hidden family separation When the US decides to allow fewer refugees in, it is also deciding to keep more families separated because a prime role of resettlement is reuniting families separated by war and other circumstances. Deborah Baliraine Jane resettled in Ohio in January 2016, but the journey that led her there from Uganda still dominates her day-to-day life as she waits for her children to also be resettled. In 2014, her husband and other men threw acid on her, scarring her face, because of the work she had done to help female victims of domestic abuse. She fled immediately, leaving her three daughters and one son with family while she sought safety. The children moved to Kenya and have been approved for resettlement in the US, but it has taken years for them to complete the interviews, vaccinations and orientations needed for processing. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say today, but we\u2019re waiting,\u201d Baliraine Jane said. But now if her children arrive as planned, they will be absorbed in a resettlement infrastructure that has crumbled under Trump. Advocates warn that even if the program were to be returned to its previous rates \u2013 an average of 95,000 people each year over four decades \u2013 the programs that support them are closing down and cutting jobs and people who work there are leaving for different fields. \u201cEven if a new administration or this administration were to change course and decide they were going to stand by these commitments, it\u2019s not going to be reconstructed in a short period of time,\u201d Carey said. The domino effect of the US retreat One of the prevailing concerns about the US curtailing its refugee program is the negative impact it has had on resettlement across the globe. Until Trump took office, the US was the world leader in refugee resettlement. In 2017, after Trump took office, the amount of resettlement places available across the globe dropped 54% compared to 2016, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). The US has supported resettlement for its moral value and diplomatic role. It was helpful, for instance, for the US to welcome in people fleeing communist regimes during the cold war. And accepting refugees is an act of solidarity with countries that accept much higher rates of people, such as Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, which have taken in 5 million Syrian refugees. \u201cWhen we resettle refugees, It\u2019s not just the people who are coming, it\u2019s also the signal we\u2019re sending,\u201d said Jen Smyers, associate director of policy and advocacy for the immigration and refugee program at Church World Service, which helps resettle refugees. Smyers continued: \u201cWhen we don\u2019t have that moral leadership, we can\u2019t ask other countries to step into that void.\u201d Advocates said it is clear the US withdrawal has had knock-on effects across the globe. In 2016, Kenya\u2019s interior cabinet secretary, Joseph Nkaissery, linked a plan to close Kenya\u2019s Dadaab refugee camp to decisions by wealthy countries to limit refugee resettlement. \u201cWe will not be the first to do so; this is the standard practice worldwide,\u201d Nkaissery said. \u201cFor example in Europe, rich, prosperous and democratic countries are turning away refugees from Syria, one of the worst war zones since World War Two.\u201d From non-partisan to political lighting rod The sudden change in attitudes towards the US refugee program emerged in the run-up to the 2016 election, when the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris were incorrectly blamed on refugees. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, then led a procession of American politicians in demonizing refugees. This tactic was used in local government election races in districts that had never even resettled refugees and in states that had tiny refugee populations. In a presidential debate, Trump said Syrian refugees were actually a \u201cgreat Trojan horse\u201d, echoing language used by President Franklin Roosevelt and other politicians in the 1930s to justify keeping Jewish admissions low during the Holocaust. For all this hysteria, however, refugees and advocates said the political messaging contradicted their own experiences of American public attitudes to refugees. After the travel ban, the International Rescue Committee said it saw a 100% increase in volunteers in Democratic-leaning states and a 90% increase in volunteers in Republican-leaning states. Those numbers have remained steady ever since. Advocates are now looking to Congress to loosen the executive branch\u2019s grip on the refugee program. Democratic lawmakers introduced two bills in April, the Grace Act and the No Ban Act. The former would set an annual admissions floor of 95,000 refugees and the latter would repeal the existing Muslim ban and prohibit the creation of similar, broad laws by the executive branch in the future. They are hoping to seize on the support for refugees in local communities. Dauda Sesay, who moved to the US in 2009, said he has experienced an overwhelmingly positive reception in Louisiana, even in the current political climate. It was an American soldier who rescued Sesay from Sierra Leone when he was 16. He was nearly mistaken for dead after he was attacked by political opponents of his father, a local leader in their village. The men killed his father and burned down Sesay\u2019s childhood home while his mother and other relatives were inside. Sesay said in normal American life, people are looking towards their future as 16-years-old. \u201cUnfortunately for me that\u2019s not what happened \u2013 it\u2019s when my whole life turned 180 degrees,\u201d he said. He recovered in a military hospital, met his wife, and spent nine years in a refugee camp in the Gambia, before coming to the US. \u201cI say thank you to this nation for giving me and my family a second chance at life,\u201d Sesay said. The most racist incident he experienced involved a university professor. Because of the professor\u2019s cruel remarks, Sesay would show up to class as late as possible to avoid the professor while still getting credit for attendance. He said it was painful, but he was awed by how his fellow students came to his defense, calling in the university dean to observe class because of the racism they had witnessed. \u201cSeeing that my fellow students advocated on my behalf, makes me appreciate this nation,\u201d Sesay said. \u201cThere are only a few, very few people that represent things like that. They don\u2019t represent the majority of this nation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
