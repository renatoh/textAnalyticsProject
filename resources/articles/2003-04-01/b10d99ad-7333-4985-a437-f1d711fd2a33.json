It cites the release of a number of political prisoners, including pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest and the increased independence of businesses, for the change to its policy. General manager Damian Perry said: 'We don't believe the boycott was helpful. Ever since we left, our local contacts have been asking us to come back.' Perry is confident that money spent with Burmese businesses will no longer find its way into the hands of the military junta. All profits from trips made there until July 2005 will go into the Intrepid Foundation - a registered charity, which funds poverty-line building projects and hospital equipment in Asia. But Tourism Concern is sorry to see Intrepid Travel change its policy. Director Tricia Barnett said: 'Aung San Suu Kyi is still asking people not to come to Burma because the $200 arrival fee reinforces the junta's position.' However, she conceded: 'It's never been a black and white issue.' The first 15-day tour leaves on 23 August and costs \u00a3560, including travel in Burma, accommodation, some meals, guides and site entry. Flights cost extra."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
