At today's Convention on Modern Liberty, those on the right set out their version \u2013 the Englishman safe in his castle, fighting off the intrusions of the wicked state. Shadow justice secretary Dominic Grieve kicked off the day with a warning that we are creating a \"state monster that is threatening to gobble up freedom\". The panellists in the subsequent session on \"The Conservatives and Civil Liberties\" quickly warmed to the theme. Laura Sandys, Conservative candidate for South Thanet, said she did not like the term \"government\" and described the state as a \"flesh-eating disease\". Blogger Iain Dale got an appreciative response when he quoted Ronald Reagan's assertion that \"the most scary words in the English language are 'I'm from the government and I am here to help.'\" Of course, the more influential and powerful governments become, the more important it is to scrutinise their actions and keep in check any erosion of liberties. But this is not the same as rubbishing the state as an idea. As Conor Gearty has warned, many people, especially the weakest and most vulnerable, rely on democratic governments to defend and protect them. Indeed, without good and active government it is impossible to deliver social justice or equality \u2013 both of which are fundamental to a wider definition of civil liberties. But during the hour-long Conservative session the panellists had nothing positive to say about the achievements of democratically elected governments. Instead, they focussed on issues from CCTV (not in the pub, unless local people want it, but maybe on the Tube), how they could avoid adopting a European-style human rights agenda (not a good thing, although no-one seemed sure exactly what it is) and the plummeting levels of trust (a breakdown in community feeling). The Labour government, as panellists taking part in a later session on \"The Left and Liberty\" heard, is undoubtedly to blame for some of this state bashing. The invasion of Iraq and its fall-out has led to a web of anti-terrorism legislation that journalist Mary Riddell said \"strikes at the heart of liberty\". Mike Rustin, professor of sociology at the University of East London, said the Labour government had failed to protect people from the excesses of the market, siding too often with big business, undermined wider civil liberties and the positive role the state can play. But this should not equate to a rejection of democratic governments. The challenge now is to tackle the real issues around privacy and surveillance and then take the argument forward so civil liberties include campaigns for equality, social justice and a renewal of the democratic process. To achieve this, elected governments that strive to represent the wishes of the people are not a wicked force \u2013 they are essential. \u2022 See more on the convention and civil liberties at liberty central"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
