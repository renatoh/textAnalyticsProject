Morning, Small Talk. You narrowly lost out on an Olympic medal in 2008. How much is Beijing a motivation? I was so young when I went to Beijing \u2013 I was 17, I went there and I had four fights [losing in the bronze medal match] and I'll have the same amount to win gold in London so I've got the experience. It's what I've been training for and dreaming about. Apparently, there are plans to show this summer's Olympics on TV and organisers may even put up a few posters in church halls. Is the pressure for London 2012 unwelcome? No, it's really exciting \u2013 a once in a lifetime opportunity for any British athlete. I can't wait to compete in front of 8,000 screaming fans \u2013 it'll be pretty special. If everyone in the Olympic village decided to have a fight, the taekwondo athletes would kick the living hell out of everyone else, no? [Chuckles] No, we're not the only fighters in the village, there's judo fighters and boxers. Every Olympic sport is tough in its own right so everyone deserves to be there. What about the wrestlers? Small Talk realises they're not exactly The Undertaker but some of those guys are pretty big. [In a flash] I wouldn't have a chance against them. And what was your favourite toy? I had a Power Ranger figurine. I actually took up taekwondo when I was five because I was trying out Power Ranger moves on my brother. Our parents took us to the local club because it was safer and I fell in love with the sport. My brother still helps me now and has coached me to gold medals a couple of times. He's very much part of team Cook. You're from Dorchester originally. What constitutes a good night out there? Some readings from Thomas Hardy? I've never been out for a night in Dorchester. I moved to Leicester and Loughborough and now I'm in Manchester so I was too young. I used to go to the cinema, though. What do you krank out on karaoke? [Thinking long and hard] Ooof. I'm trying to think of one. What would be easy to sing? Probably a Rihanna song, I'd try my hand at one of hers. [Genuinely distressed] I can't think of one, though. I know I'd struggle on the high notes. Talking of Rihanna, who would you rather take on a trip to Dorchester Cineworld \u2013 her or Katy Perry? Aaah. I don't know, they're both beautiful, amazing women. I'd probably go for Rihanna, though \u2026 I could just see her being a bit more lively and entertaining. [Suddenly] Actually put both down. I'll take both of them out. You've fought your way around the world. What's your favourite city? Apart from Leicester. I love America. I love Florida, I must have been to Disney World a good seven times. I've been to Vegas four or five times. I'd just turned 21 when I won the US Open there and I had a bit of a gamble. I came out even and paid for the night out so I couldn't complain. Who's the most famous person in your mobile? Tanni Grey-Thompson. She mentored me in the run-up to Beijing and we still talk now. She's got loads of advice on how to handle yourself at the Olympics and she's a fantastic woman. Have you ever seen a ghost? No one ever says yes, so we'll get to the next que \u2026 [Quickly] I have yes. My grandma passed away last year and I saw her at a bus stop. I might have been wrong. But I was in my car and looked to my side and she was just how I used to picture my grandma. I looked away and got really cold and shivery and when I looked back in my mirror she was gone. I think she was probably just saying goodbye \u2026 she could have done it in a nicer way though, not at a bus stop. What's the last film you saw? Act of Valor/[Valour if you're going with the English spelling]. The actors are real Navy Seals, it was brilliant, very realistic and eye-opening. Who would play you in a film of your life? Small Talk imagines it would be someone good at kicking people. Jason Statham maybe \u2026 Hmmm. I'm not good with actor's names. The English actor in Warrior \u2026 Tom Hardy, he'll be able to do the English accent too. He's my pick. And finally, the big question. What's the largest animal you could knock out with one kick? A squirrel? A tortoise? Mike Gatting? Largest animal \u2026 Let's go \u2026 Let's go big \u2026 a hippo. As long as it's not on the charge. Small Talk will keep that hippo tethered, Aaron. Thanks for your time. Thanks, Small Talk. Bye.
