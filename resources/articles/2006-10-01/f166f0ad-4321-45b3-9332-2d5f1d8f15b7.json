Some women, the bereaved, have not cast off their mourning robes since 2003. Others, Christians included, wear Muslim dress as camouflage to preserve their lives. Driving a car or walking bare-headed is a come-on to executioners in a country where last year's Western fashions have become this season's shroud. These are hideous times for women targeted by Shiite and Sunni militias. As my colleague Peter Beaumont reported earlier this month, murder rates are rising for those in the wrong sect, the wrong job or simply the wrong place. In the new Iraq, there is only one way to live, in fear and enforced submission, but death comes in many forms. If the revenge killers, armed robbers and rape gangs do not get you, then suicide bombers might. It would be false, in any war, to cast women as victims. The prosecutors, the combatants and torturers of this conflict all have a female element. Women have no monopoly on peace, democracy, human rights or broken hearts. But there are many dangers, beyond personal fates, in allowing the women, and all other civilians, of Iraq and Afghanistan to become the shadowy Greek chorus of their wars. With the American midterm elections imminent, the rhetoric is heavy with machismo. Generals rattle sabres, as Bush and Blair reinforce the creed of toughness. If Nouri al-Maliki, the Iraqi leader, cannot show some neo-Saddamite backbone, then Bush may yet favour someone more dictatorial. Statisticians dissect the Lancet's estimate of 650,000 dead, while no one notices that back gardens and football fields are being dug for overspill graveyards. Even by its own brutal standards, war has become dehumanised, yet oddly sanitised too. Technology lets onlookers see everything, but shame or failure have neutralised the scent of blood and blurred the images of torment. Once the war on terror was sold as a feminist crusade. Bush claimed to fight 'for the rights and dignity of women' and Cherie Blair talked about helping Afghan women to 'free their spirit'. Such words sound hollow now, after a week in which Nato bombers killed at least 12 civilians in an area previously declared Taliban-free by the alliance. In a climate of reborn repression, an Afghan headmaster was beheaded not long ago, in front of his wife and eight children, for daring to educate girls. In Iraq, the Western coalition has presided over a catastrophe in which the emancipated women of a once-secular state suffer more repression than their grandmothers. It is ironic, at the least, that female British cabinet ministers queue up to denounce the veil while never apologising for mandating a war propelling women back to the Dark Ages. Iraq is now a country where a woman's face may be classified by rapists and murderers as what Australia's leading Muslim cleric calls 'uncovered meat'. The great veil debate, a staple of the British radio talk show, is being played out for real in Baghdad's morgues. Hence the silent exodus. An Iraqi women told me yesterday that her friends are desperate to marry foreigners, however old, ill-educated or unknown. 'Marriage to a stranger is an escape route,' she said. 'Their only concern is to get out of Iraq.' This week, like every other, 10,000 people will cross the Syrian border. Since the war began, 3,500 women may have been trafficked into prostitution and Unicef says Iraqi girls as young as 12 are working in the brothels of Damascus for a few dollars a day. These are the women and children who were going to throw flowers at their liberators. In the absence of WMD, they were the casus belli on whose thin shoulders rested the edifice of war. And now, in the disaster of the invasion, they are all but invisible. Bush and Blair made these citizens the bearers of their spurious dreams. With military scores to settle and congressional elections to fight, there is no time to linger on a refugee crisis or an imploded society. The political bind is grim enough without shining any spotlights on the messy human detritus of war. But already the backlash has started. As ever, it is being run in the name of women. Terrorised by militias and sold short by the new constitution, they are the greatest losers of a nascent theocracy. They were, the latest argument goes, better off under Saddam. Though that is true, in many cases, it is not helpful to hark back to an era when no one had rights. You can argue, as I always have, that the Iraq war was an illegal fiasco, but any idea that Saddam presided over an age of enlightenment, however relative, merely feeds an argument smothered in superannuated blame. Much as it may soothe Western consciences, there is little practical point in arguing that Blair should have been ousted long ago or musing on how much better things could have been if only Donald Rumsfeld, the black architect of postwar planning, had fallen under a tank. Navel-gazing distracts from the real issue, which is what can be done to help Iraqis. The easy answer is: nothing. The military is never there for the families who wake to find the mahdi army's calling card of a Kalashnikov bullet and a note that reads: 'Leave your area now.' It is understandable that 51 per cent of British women, watching the slaughter of civilians and the grief of soldiers' families, want troops out. But premature departure, a victory salute to jihadists, would almost certainly mean anarchy. How many children's bodies does it take to make a bloodbath? And do Western peacemongers dare risk unleashing such a fate? Despite the real danger of making things worse, it may still be better, just, for the occupiers to stay. But that offers no solution, beyond pushing back the last frontiers of hell. Mass troop deployment, or miracles, might help restore security, but neither looks likely. The only feasible way forward is a return to the human values invoked, so rashly, in the prospectus for war. That would mean humility and acknowledgment of failure. It would mean realising that military force is bankrupt. It would mean abandoning the politics of delusion before Afghanistan becomes Iraq Mark Two. It would mean treating with terrorists, where necessary, and taking Iran and Syria off the death row of diplomacy. It would mean accepting that the isolationism of Bush and Blair has achieved no victory, beyond moulding the template of an atomised world. And it would mean dedicating all future foreign policy to those who die and suffer without even the consolation of hoping that their sacrifice will procure a better tomorrow. Any woman in any war-torn Iraqi street could tell our leaders that much. But she is too busy trying to stay alive. mary.riddell@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
