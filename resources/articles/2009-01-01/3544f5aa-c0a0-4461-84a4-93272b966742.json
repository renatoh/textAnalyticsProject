Official figures released yesterday showed that manufacturing production declined by 2.9% in November. Excluding summer 2002, when celebrations for the Queen's golden jubilee caused a short-lived slip, that made it the weakest month since June 1985. \"As has been the case in many other economies, industrial activity in the UK has now fallen off a cliff,\" said Paul Dales, of the consultancy Capital Economics. He added that, in total, output had dropped by 7.8% from its peak, to a level last seen in 1995. \"In other words, 14 years of gains in activity have been wiped out in just nine months.\" Industrial production, which includes mining and energy as well as manufacturing, fell 2.3% in November, to a level 6.9% lower than the same month in 2007. The fresh evidence of the parlous state of British industry will intensify demands for action from the government to support threatened firms and provide re-training for workers who lose their jobs. Gordon Brown will hold a \"jobs summit\" on Monday to outline his response to rapidly rising unemployment, and the Treasury is preparing a package of measures to unblock clogged credit markets. Vince Cable, Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said the scale of the decline in output raised fears that the manufacturing sector would be so severely gouged that it would be unable to benefit from rising demand and the cheap pound once the worst of the downturn is over. \"If the British economy is now going to be restructured, then the traded sector will have to have a larger role, and this is ominously not a good start,\" he said. \"We can't have an economy that is based primarily on pyramid-selling schemes in the City and on finance; a return to more solidly based things like manufacturing has to be part of the mix.\" The worse-than-expected news from manufacturers underlined the speed at which the economy deteriorated in the final quarter of last year. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research said the fall in output pointed to a 1.5% contraction in gross domestic product in the three months to December, which would make it the weakest quarter since 1980. The respected thinktank added that there had only been five quarters in which output fell more sharply since quarterly GDP figures were first produced in 1955. Steve Radley, chief economist at the employers' group EEF, said few sectors had escaped the downturn. \"This is a sign that confidence has fallen right acoss the globe, and that all the major economies are affected,\" he said. He added that further layoffs among distressed manufacturers were likely in the coming weeks, after the announcement of 1,200 job cuts at Nissan's Sunderland plant last week. Many carmakers announced longer-than-usual shutdowns over the Christmas holidays in response to a sharp decline in demand from consumers suffering from the credit crunch, but the new figures reveal that car production plunged by 21.7% in November, even before most of the emergency closures began. The woes of British industry were echoed right across Europe in November, as firms slashed production amid plunging demand from consumers in all the world's major markets. Industrial production in Germany slumped by 3.1% in November, and in France it declined by 2.4%. Analysts at RBS said that on the basis of these gloomy figures, industrial output in the eurozone as a whole looked likely to have declined by about 4% in the final quarter of 2008."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
