It is an award that Gary Megson can also expect to have bestowed upon him if he succeeds in his mission to restore Premiership football to the club. His chances of achieving that ambition will have improved again after this well-deserved but late victory. It was another day of tension and rancour that threatened to turn sour until two goals in the final 10 minutes soothed the fevered brow of the Nationwide League's serial prowler of the technical area. At one point, Megson had to endure a cascade of jeers from his own fans for the decision to substitute Artim Sakiri, the one bright spark in 55 minutes of drudgery. But he was left to laugh longest as his replacement, Jason Koumas, produced the perfect corner for Darren Moore to break the deadlock with a towering header. To ram home Megson's tactical triumph, Lloyd Dyer then made the most of Crystal Palace's attempts to rescue a lost cause, hitting his first senior goal on the break to turn the boos to howls of delight. Albion inched closer to their goal of an instant return and rewarded the crucial decisions of their manager. 'Those people that booed, I am sure they will turn round now and say maybe they were wrong and I was right. I didn't take off Artim because he was playing badly, I just wanted to give us a better option of winning the game and it worked,' said Megson. 'You could feel the tension lift when Darren scored and that is all that matters in the end. It is easy to take decisions. It is the consequences that matter. I know the fans were booing me, but I will continue to do my job professionally and for the best of West Brom.' Moore, a devout Christian, deserves his return to the Premiership more than most after a cruciate-ligament injury left him a spectator for most of their campaign among the elite. His superb header for only his second goal of the season pushed Albion towards their fourth successive victory and left Crystal Palace manager Iain Dowie deflated. 'It was a moment of defensive madness,' he said. 'My back four switched off and that cost us the game. I know who should have been marking Darren and the big lad does not need a second invitation.' Palace frustrated Albion for long periods and could have pinched the points themselves if Andrew Johnson's 71st-minute header had contained more conviction. By the time Neil Shipperley's header struck the crossbar in stoppage time, it was too late to rescue the situation as Palace slipped to their third successive away defeat. While Albion's lead over third place was extended by Sheffield United's defeat at Cardiff City, Palace's own aspirations of joining them in the Premiership via the play-offs are receding as quickly as Dowie's hairline. They are now nine points adrift of the top six with only eight games remaining. Predictably, Dowie is refusing to accept that it is a lost cause, but nothing short of maximum points from trips to Cardiff and Rotherham United will be enough to maintain their outside interest in the end-of-season lottery for a place in the big time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
