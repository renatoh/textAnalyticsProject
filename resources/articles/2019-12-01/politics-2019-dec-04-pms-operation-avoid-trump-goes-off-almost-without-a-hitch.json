One of these days we\u2019re going to see Stanley Johnson elbowing his way through a flag backdrop and inquiring of the world\u2019s media: \u201cAre you lovely lot all here for me?\u201d Answer: no. I\u2019m afraid tickets to public life are non-transferable. But at Wednesday\u2019s summit in Watford, Johnson Jr was going to be a big boy boss and do it all on his own. Yes, here he comes, Cuck Norris, electioneering from behind a Nato platform. He\u2019s not a statesman, but he plays one on TV. For this press conference, Johnson was being minded by Dominic Cummings, who was clad in a heavily unbuttoned shirt, and watching from the sidelines with all the easy charm of an East German gymnastics coach. Oof. You really, really don\u2019t want to mess up those landings, prime minister, or deliver your \u201cCorbyn means two referendums\u201d line merely twice, and not the three times you were instructed. Otherwise you\u2019ll be getting the belt and another injection tonight. Fortunately for his life expectancy \u2013 and his precious fertility \u2013 Johnson followed his coach\u2019s instructions. Not once in the entire press conference or the questions thereafter did he utter the word \u201cTrump\u201d, or even the word \u201cpresident\u201d. Instead, he found endless distancing variants, from \u201cthe current US administration\u201d to \u201cthe United States\u201d to simply ignoring the mention of Trump in any question. Unfortunately, the prime minister had appeared rather more forthcoming when he thought he wasn\u2019t being watched. Tuesday\u2019s Buckingham Palace reception yielded a couple of viral clips, in which Johnson could be seen joining in with Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macron as they took the piss out of Donald Trump, in order to amuse Princess Anne, who many viewers assumed had herself just done the Alan Partridge \u201cso what?\u201d shrug at the Queen when she got a dirty look for not greeting the US president/hotelier. (Incidentally, the latter sentence marks the exact point at which the \u201csentences you didn\u2019t expect to type four years ago\u201d officially outnumbered all the other typed sentences, ever. We have reached it: the political singularity. There is now no way back to normality.) As far as the Buckingham Palace piss-taking was concerned, Johnson was stagily baffled. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what is being referred to,\u201d he said of things that people can literally see happening on film. \u201cThat\u2019s complete nonsense,\u201d he eye-rolled. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that\u2019s come from.\u201d From the film of it happening. It\u2019s come from the film of it happening. For their part, No 10 tried a slightly different tack. A senior source scrambled to tell lobby journalists: \u201cIt is others that were having the conversations and Boris certainly was not leading.\u201d \u201cNot leading.\u201d You don\u2019t need to tell us that, dear \u2013 he\u2019s barely turned up to his own general election campaign. Yet preposterously, we\u2019ve spent much of the past few days having to listen to radioactively bad-taste declarations that Johnson is the only one who will stand up to terrorists, when he\u2019s miles too scared to even stand up to Andrew Neil. I try not to pay too much attention to terrorist methods, but I\u2019m pretty sure they don\u2019t bring down planes and buildings and decent people with the polite inquiry: \u201cHow many children do you have?\u201d In the event of an actual terrorist attack, Boris Johnson is the guy who\u2019d pull you in front of him as a human shield. So yes, I believe the term is \u201cleading from behind\u201d. In fact, the Buckingham Palace camera picked up Johnson pulling some weird lumbering move for the others, perhaps imitating Trump\u2019s rather simian deportment. This would feel somewhat glass-housed in the circs. You should do a fat joke next, prime minister, or maybe one about him having stupid hair. Still, Operation Avoid Trump was arguably the most successful Nato mission in a while. With the exception of single brief handshake, we didn\u2019t get public sight of the rituals of Johnson and his brother-from-another-mother. Trump and Johnson are believed to be the last two remaining manscaped orangutans in the world, but as the past two days have shown, you can\u2019t get them to hang around in the room together long enough to do their political mating. What you can have instead is Johnson bellowing \u201cget Brexit done\u201d behind a Nato podium, while foreign journalists tried to ask him important questions about the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. Stay classy, PM. \u201cI want to strengthen MI5,\u201d Johnson droned. \u201cBut Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party want to install a home secretary who wants to disband MI5.\u201d Asked whether He Who Must Not be Named could be trusted on his professed lack of interest in including the NHS in trade negotiations, Johnson affected outrage. \u201cI think I might just wind up this press conference now because I think we\u2019re scraping the barrel,\u201d he tutted. The barrel? Oh my God, the barrel! I remember the barrel. We scraped through its bottom so long ago that we\u2019re now five miles beneath it, and still tunnelling like bastards. IN THE NAME OF SANITY, TAKE US BACK TO THE BARREL! We didn\u2019t know we were born."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
