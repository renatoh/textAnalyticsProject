Two men, aged 46 and 48 from Bridgnorth in Shropshire, were ejected from the away section during the 2-2 draw and later arrested by Sussex Police outside the ground. They have since been released pending investigation. The incident was one of several cases of alleged homophobic abuse at top-flight matches during a week in which the Premier League has backed Stonewall\u2019s Rainbow Laces campaign in support of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender people in sport. Brighton\u2019s chief executive and deputy chairman, Paul Barber, told the club\u2019s official website: \u201cIt\u2019s both sad and depressing that once again we find ourselves having to address another situation of discriminatory abuse. Prior to kick-off, we had a huge show of support for the Rainbow Laces campaign brilliantly backed by the vast majority of people inside the stadium, and yet before the game is over, we are forced to deal with these two individuals, who think it\u2019s OK to behave in this way. \u201cWorking with Sussex Police, I\u2019m pleased to report that once again our staff were able to take swift action, which hopefully will increase the chances of a conviction. We simply won\u2019t stand for it at the Amex. Once again, it\u2019s very hard to comprehend why some individuals think it\u2019s acceptable to behave in this way, but we are very clear that neither Brighton and Hove Albion, nor the wider football community, will tolerate homophobia or discrimination at any time, in any form. We would urge any fans confronted with similar discriminatory behaviour to report it immediately, either directly to a steward or via our anonymous hotline, and we will take strong action.\u201d Wolves have confirmed they will be supporting Sussex Police\u2019s investigation into the incident and say they strongly condemn any form of discrimination. A club statement said: \u201cWolves can confirm that there were two arrests for homophobic abuse at yesterday\u2019s game against Brighton and Hove Albion. There is no room in football or society for discrimination of any kind, and the club strongly condemns such behaviour. \u201cOur ethos at Wolves is about being \u2018One Pack\u2019 \u2013 an attitude our supporters are very passionate about and that extends to our relationships across the football community, regardless of rivalries on the pitch. The club is now offering its support to Sussex Police in what is a criminal investigation.\u201d A Sussex Police statement said: \u201cTwo football fans were arrested following reports of homophobic gestures made at the Amex Stadium on Sunday 8 December. The suspects \u2013 both away fans during Brighton and Hove Albion\u2019s match against Wolverhampton Wanderers \u2013 were identified by club stewards and arrested on suspicion of using threatening or abusive words or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress. \u201cThe two men \u2013 aged 46 and 48, and both from Bridgnorth in Shropshire \u2013 have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.\u201d Monday\u2019s announcements from Brighton and Wolves come after Everton launched an investigation on Sunday into reports of homophobic chanting aimed at Chelsea fans during the Toffees\u2019 3-1 victory at Goodison Park on Saturday. Also on Sunday, a 41-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offence following Saturday\u2019s Manchester derby between City and United at the Etihad Stadium."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
