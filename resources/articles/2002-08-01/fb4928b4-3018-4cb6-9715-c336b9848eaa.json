Both were three-year-olds and Barathea Blazer (2.55) can strike another blow for the younger generation in today's big betting race at York. Mick Kinane, successful last year, partnered Barathea Blazer when Peter Harris's colt landed a major gamble at Newbury in May. He will be getting down to his lowest weight for some time to renew his association and the effort should be worthwhile - Barathea Blazer looked to be crying out for this longer trip when chasing home Sun Bird at Haydock last time. Dawn Invasion, from the stable successful with Give The Slip, and Charley Bates are other three-year-olds with the right sort of credentials. Bourgeois could prove best of the more experienced runners. Islington (2.20), for whom there were valid excuses for her poor run in the Oaks, can turn Epsom tables on Kazzia in the Yorkshire equivalent. Sir Michael Stoute's filly looked better than ever when trotting up at Goodwood and should stay a mile and a half. Stoute can initiate a double with Leadership (1.45) , who ran so well behind Vintage Premium here last month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
