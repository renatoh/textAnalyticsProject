The Manchester United defender was handed the punishment by a three-man disciplinary commission on December 19 but the FA have now received the 120-page document which confirms the player's wish to appeal. Ferdinand will begin the ban tomorrow in the hope that if his suspension is reduced or revoked on appeal he may be free to play for England at Euro 2004. A statement on the FA's official website www.thefa.com said: \"The FA has today received an appeal from Rio Ferdinand against the decision of an Independent Disciplinary Commission on 19th December 2003, and against the sanction imposed. \"A date for an appeal hearing will be set in due course. \"As there has been no request to set aside Rio Ferdinand's suspension, it will start tomorrow, 20th January as ordered by the Commission.\" Ferdinand was selected for a random drugs test by UK Sport representatives at United's Carrington training ground on September 23 but failed to attend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
