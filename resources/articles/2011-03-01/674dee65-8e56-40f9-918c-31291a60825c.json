Despite showing \"no ability whatsoever\", following an arbitrary division between the senior and junior races, he surprised himself by romping to victory over a group of younger boys. \"The strange thing about it was that it was quite a turning point in my own school career and gave me a tremendous boost in confidence, even knowing all the coincidences that made it possible,\" he recalls. \"The thing about sport is stretching yourself to do things you never thought were possible, it's learning to cope with success and also disappointment. It can really transform people.\" A second such moment, the secretary of state for culture, media, Olympics and sport says, occurred more recently. \"When I took the brief in opposition four years ago, it is true to say that I knew least about sport,\" says Hunt, the breadth of his remit is demonstrated by books about Henry Moore and, bizarrely, N-Dubz on the coffee table in front of him and paintings of racing silks on the walls. \"But I have enjoyed it the most. It has completely blown me away. Both how easy it is to get gripped by the many things going on in the sporting world but also how incredibly powerful it is as a tool to inspire young people.\" Stirring stuff, illustrated by tales of his trip to a rocking Aviva Stadium to see Ireland stop England in their tracks and the looming responsibility of officiating his first junior football match this weekend \u2013 he is taking an FA refereeing course that has now entered the practical phase. But a world away from the knotty policy decisions and Byzantine power struggles facing Hunt as he bears responsibility for delivering the \u00a39.3bn Olympics project, wrestles with intractable problems in football's corridors of power and attempts to put a brave face on the effect his government's cuts programme will have on grassroots sport. Ten months after assuming cabinet responsibility for sport, Hunt has finally agreed to speak about it because he is keen to talk up the School Games, launched last week with a letter to head teachers signed by him and Lord Coe. Last autumn an angry and articulate coalition of schoolchildren, teachers, Olympians and sports administrators \u2013 backed by opposition MPs concerned recent gains would be squandered \u2013 forced the government into a U-turn over plans by Hunt's colleague Michael Gove to slash funding for school sport. According to those involved, even natural political opponents, Hunt played a pivotal role in winning his colleagues round and emerged with much credit. Concern lingers among those at the sharp end but a new funding formula \u2013 based around plans for a network of inter- and intra-school competition that will culminate in regional and national finals \u2013 has given them confidence. \"It would be completely wrong to say that under Labour the targets were about participation and that under the coalition it's about competition. We need both,\" says Hunt. \"We've got an obesity crisis to tackle. But we also need actively to embrace the power of competitive sport because life is very tough and it is one of the best ways to teach people how to cope with success and failure.\" But inspiring young people through sport was just one of the legacy promises to help London secure the Games. Another was the notion a home Olympics would somehow inspire the rest of us to get off the sofa. It is a feat that has not been achieved by any previous Games \u2013 and the omens for London do not look good. Hunt admits the overall national aim to get 2m more people playing sport and exercising by 2013 has been quietly dropped and it is understood the only remaining component - a 1m target to get more adults playing sport three times a week that will be nowhere near achieved - will shortly follow suit, to be replaced by a more \"meaningful\" national ambition. Listening to Hunt, the Charterhouse-educated son of a naval officer who admits he enjoyed \"fantastic\" sporting facilities at school despite his lack of aptitude, lay out his plans in measured terms it is easy to forget the devastation that could be wrought on local sports facilities owing to his government's cuts. Hunt insists Sport England, which like the elite sport agency UK Sport has had its funding protected by Hunt thanks to changes in the way Lottery money is distributed, will help maintain investment. But early evidence from around the country has swimming pools, leisure centres and community sports projects pulling up the shutters as local authorities cope with the cuts the government says are necessary to deal with the deficit. \"Let's look at this again in six months' time. I think the local authorities I have had contact with are extremely committed to their sporting provision and are finding new structures and new ways of doing things,\" says Hunt. Part of the reason there has been so much focus on the Olympic legacy has been that preparations for the Games had \u2013 until very recently \u2013 been remarkably smooth, once the initial storm over the \u00a39.3bn budget passed. Hunt urges caution as he ruminates on the scale of the task across 19 government departments, from the 150 heads of state that the Foreign Office will have to co-ordinate to the obvious transport challenges. \"Things are on track but when you think of the scale of this, the number of things that could go wrong is also huge. There is absolutely no room for complacency,\" Hunt says. Aside from the obvious medal chances in the velodrome and pool, where he will doubtless have the best vantage points on offer, he has applied for tickets to other less heavily subscribed events. \"My wife's Chinese so I'm going to apply in the ballot for some tickets to the badminton finals and the table tennis finals in the hope it will be Britain against China for those.\" The coalition of interest that had been holding the various Olympic agencies together has been shattered in recent weeks, however. The British Olympic Association's row with the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games over the way any hypothetical surplus is defined and distributed, now heading for the Court of Arbitration for Sport, could not have come at a worse time. The IOC's inspectors arrive today for the latest of their regular visits and next week the Olympic sporting world descends on London for the SportAccord conference. Hunt chooses his words carefully but cannot hide his annoyance and admits to being \"very concerned\" about the escalating row. It is clear where Hunt's sympathies lie \u2013 not least because the government believes it is first in line for the first \u00a363m of any hypothetical surplus. \"The last thing anyone wants is for key people to be distracted by having to deal with lawyers when we should be focused on operational and logistical issues,\" says Hunt. From one warring tribe we move seamlessly to another \u2013 the depressing, familiar questions swirling around the way English football is run. Hunt talks up the success of the Premier League but does not diverge from the assessment of the sports minister, Hugh Robertson, who called football the worst governed sport in Britain. \"Most people find it difficult not to share those views, because there have been so many disappointments in the way football governance has worked in recent years,\" he says. Hunt talks about the need to increase the number of qualified coaches, make it easier for supporters to take a stake in their clubs and produce more homegrown talent to the benefit of the national team. Nobody would disagree with those aims. The question is whether the government has the will to drive through the means. Once the parliamentary committee delivers its report Hunt insists he will not be slow to act. \"There is a moment now, with the select committee inquiry, with the humility we have to feel over the lack of success of that [World Cup] bid and the England team in South Africa, when we can come together and create something that works,\" he says. Hunt was not alone in looking shell-shocked by the 2018 bid team's failure to secure more than a single vote as he filed out of the conference hall in Zurich where the decision was announced. That immersion in a brand of politics even more mendacious than the Westminster kind left a strong impression. \"Looking back, I was very disappointed that in retrospect every discussion I had with people associated with the bid in that week wasn't about who had the best bid but it was about who was doing deals with who,\" he says. \"It was very disappointing and I do believe Fifa has to be a lot more transparent. I talked about English football having a moment and I think Fifa has an opportunity now to reform itself in the way the IOC did in 1998 after Salt Lake City and I hope it embraces that opportunity.\" Some hope. Hunt possesses a likeability that some of his colleagues on the Tory front bench lack and, despite the odd high-profile gaffe, many believe that he is destined for promotion shortly after the Olympics. Yet for all that he has impressed many in sport, there are others who believe the debate over football governance will revert to type \u2013 strong words, followed by inertia \u2013 and are waiting for the impact of the looming local authority cuts, in particular, with horror. They fear the government has effectively swapped all the bold legacy promises for grassroots sport that were attached to the Olympics for a two-week jamboree that will make the nation feel a bit better about itself. But Hunt insists he remains committed to a genuine legacy, having acquired a real love of sport and its potential. \"I would never claim that I'm going to win a pub quiz on sport but I would hope people will be able to see my commitment to sport by what I've done,\" he says. \"I've got the zeal of a convert and the enthusiasm of someone who genuinely loves something that hadn't been part of my life for many years, probably since school, and is now something I really enjoy.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
