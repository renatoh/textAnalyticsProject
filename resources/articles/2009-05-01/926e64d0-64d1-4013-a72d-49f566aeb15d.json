You can tell just by walking past their Swindon terrace home, where the windowsills are lined with model vehicles. Classic Minis are what the couple like best, and until recently the pair would spend weekends at Mini shows and conventions. Not any more. For the past four months the couple have barely been able to afford to go to the supermarket, let alone indulge their passion. The Alfa Romeo Chiffers had bought on finance is already back at the dealership. And the painful irony is that the source of their money woes is exactly what makes them most happy: cars. Until 30 January Chiffers, 62, worked for a Japanese haulage company called MIK Logistics, part of the Honda group. The Swindon branch had just one main customer: the enormous Honda plant in the north-east corner of the town, which had employed about 5,000 local people since being extended in 2000. Bertram, 50, was an agency worker contracted by a firm called STVA, which transports new cars via rail. The Swindon outpost of STVA was based on the Honda site. Chiffers's job was to visit Honda's suppliers, picking up engine parts, fuel tanks and brake pipes and transporting them via lorry to Swindon. He earned \u00a38 an hour and generally worked 14-15 hours a day, five days a week, making about \u00a3560 a week before tax. Bertram, who would load new cars on to train wagons, earned \u00a36 an hour. By the end of January both had no work to go to. Bertram was told one Friday that her services would no longer be required because the Honda plant was shutting down for four months. As an agency worker she would receive no pay-off. Chiffers was slightly more fortunate \u2014 his company decided to follow Honda's lead and shut down for the same four months until the start of June, promising to pay permanent staff full basic pay for the first two months, amounting to a 40-hour week \u2014 meaning far fewer hours and less money that he was used to. For the last two months of the shutdown Chiffers has received just 50% of that. When the plant reopens on Monday he hopes to be back in business and on full pay. When Honda decided to halt production at Swindon after global sales fell sharply year on year, it was unclear what would happen to those directly employed by the Japanese car firm. In the end 1,300 workers took the Associate Release Programme, which is Honda's favoured euphemism for voluntary redundancies. Around 3,500 opted to ride out the storm, and have not been at work since the plant shut on 31 January. They have been told work will resume on 1 June, when the plant is expected to start producing the new Jazz. One of the workers who decided to cut his losses and be \"released\" was 44-year-old Paul Cushion, who had spent more than 18 years working in Honda's press shop, where panels for the cars were made. He took the decision to leave two weeks before the plant shut down in January. \"I didn't want to feel I wasn't in charge of my life so I decided to get out while there was a decent offer on the table,\" he said. Cushion was given a payout and now runs a company called Bikersmate, which sells motorcycle parts on the internet auction site eBay. Stephen Williams, 49, from Chippenham, who has worked on the Honda production line in Swindon for eight years, decided to stay on. \"It seemed the sensible thing to do,\" he said. \"As you get older you get less employable, so you look at it and say, 'I have 12 years left of my working life.' If I do take redundancy I could be out of work for another three or four years. \"It has been hard finding things to do,\" said Williams. But with the support of the Unite union, which represents the workers, he has enrolled on an IT course at Wiltshire College's Calne campus. Like all the workers hit by the four-month shutdown, Williams will owe Honda 250 hours of overtime when he returns to work in June. This means that any overtime that he works when production picks up again will be unpaid. Despite obvious hardships caused by the shutdown, the Honda workers are in some ways the lucky ones. There are many people in Swindon and beyond whose livelihoods relied on the factory being up and running \u2014 dozens of suppliers, as well as the logistics firms Chiffers and Bertram worked for \u2014 who have been hit much harder by the halt in production. It is a bitter blow, said Bertram. \"Sometimes I get annoyed when people say 'poor Honda workers'. Everyone seems to forget about people like us, who were part of the infrastructure around the plant.\" Until very recently, Swindon was the archetypal boomtown, boasting near enough full employment, with blue chip firms such as Motorola, Intel and Zurich Financial Services moving into town in Honda's wake. But these are exactly the sort of firms hit hardest by the economic downturn, and the people of Swindon are suffering as a result. In January Swindon saw the highest percentage increase of unemployment benefit claimants in the country. But amid the doom and gloom, there is a ray of light emanating from a showroom in Ashworth Road in the east of the town centre. Mark Riddiford, of Fish Brothers Honda, said business was booming. \"We've had a lot of people coming in here saying specifically that they want to buy a Honda to support the local workforce,\" he said. \"Perhaps it's the Dunkirk spirit.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
