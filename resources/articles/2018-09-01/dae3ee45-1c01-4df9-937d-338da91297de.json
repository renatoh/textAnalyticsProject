Joshua, who puts his WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight belts on the line against Alexander Povetkin at Wembley on Saturday, wants Wilder, the WBC champion, next. But Hearn said talks with the American\u2019s camp have broken down and it could take at least a year for the fight to take place. Hearn said: \u201cIt comes to a stage where if they won\u2019t even reply to us, how can you try to make the fight? My dad emailed Shelley Finkel [Wilder\u2019s co-manager] a fortnight ago and said: \u2018We\u2019ve sent you a signed contract on all the terms you agreed\u2019, but they didn\u2019t respond. It\u2019s very strange. If they want to make it for April, we need to have some dialogue. If you want 50-50, at least tell me so we can discuss terms.\u201d Another complicating factor is that Hearn wants to name Joshua\u2019s next opponent before Wilder fights Tyson Fury, which is expected to take place in early December. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait until then because of all Joshua\u2019s mandatory situations,\u201d Hearn said. \u201cJoshua will box in April and then he won\u2019t fight again until November or December 2019.\u201d Joshua knocked out Whyte in seven brutal rounds in December 2015 but wobbled badly in the early stages, and Hearn believes there would be a huge buzz about a rematch. \u201cWhyte is a much bigger fight than Povetkin in Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the world scene Povetkin is well known and credible, but Whyte, with the history of the first fight, the build-up, it\u2019s a huge fight.\u201d Hearn accused Fury of cashing out by deciding to face Wilder in the early stages of his comeback following a drug ban and well-publicised problems away from the ring. \u201cIf it\u2019s a massive offer and he\u2019s got a chance of winning the world heavyweight title, we shouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s mad,\u201d Hearn said. \u201cBut he\u2019s smart enough to know in his mind he\u2019s nowhere near ready. The problem is it\u2019s one thing training for Sefer Seferi and Francesco Pianeta and another being match-fit for Deontay Wilder.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
