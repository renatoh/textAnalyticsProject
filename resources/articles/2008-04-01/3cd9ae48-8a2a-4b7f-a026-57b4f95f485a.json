The England No 3, Luke McShane, now plays little but retains his strength, drawing with the world No1, Vishy Anand, in this season's Bundesliga. The big mover is our youngest grandmaster David Howell, 17, who has advanced to fifth place, the same spot as his Norwegian contemporary Magnus Carlsen has reached on the world list. Howell has regained the edge in his race with England's other young hope, GM Gawain Jones, who has dropped to ninth. It is an ageing list, with only seven of the top 100 born after 1985. Translated, this means that the Fischer babes of a quarter of a century ago, who took England to No 2 behind the USSR, are now middle aged and past their chess peaks. Who, besides Howell and Jones, can replace them? The outlook is murky, probably bleak. Not a single junior younger than Howell ranks in the top 100 yet. England's best two under-17 prospects, allowing for age, are the Surrey 14-year-olds Yang-Fan Zhou of Whitgift and Samuel Franklin of Dulwich. Both have made large rating advances in recent months but have yet to reach the master 2200 level. Another significant move is by the Cambridge academic Harriet Hunt, who has passed Scotland's Keti Arakhamia-Grant as the UK's top-rated woman. Hunt, who holds the IM title at men's level and is No 27 in the overall England list, finished a good fourth at the strong Stockholm women's open last month, defeating the tournament winner with this fine attacking game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
