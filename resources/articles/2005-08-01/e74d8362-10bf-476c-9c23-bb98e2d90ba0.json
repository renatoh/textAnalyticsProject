Though Jose Mourinho can win with his best players on the sidelines the same does not appear to true for Spurs, who with Michael Carrick, Jermain Defoe and Edgar Davids all on the bench, were fortunate to maintain their unbeaten start against a Blackburn side reduced to 10 men by the dismissal of Lucas Neill. The Australian had already been booked when he clattered into Davids from behind, giving Dermot Gallagher little option but to brandish a second yellow card. It is Blackburn's second sending-off of the season after Paul Dickov's dismissal at West Ham 12 days ago and will no doubt augment the belief that Mark Hughes's side lacks discipline. Rovers were fined \u00a310,000 by the Football Association last week after accumulating five red cards and 74 bookings last season. They have a \u00a350,000 fine suspended until the end of the campaign and could face further problems if the FA decides to review a second-half incident win which Andy Todd appeared to butt Andy Reid, though Gallagher took no action. \"I think [Todd] was excited a little bit because otherwise I can't understand this,\" said Jol, who added that Reid had a \"bump on his forehead\". Hughes claimed, predictably, that he had not seen the incident, though the Blackburn manager did acknowledge that Neill's sending off was justified. \"It was an ill-advised challenge given that he had an earlier yellow card,\" said Hughes. Until Neill's rush of blood Rovers had looked by far the better side, though with Dickov suspended and Craig Bellamy injured they lacked a cutting edge. Hughes had little option but to deploy Shefki Kuqi as a lone striker and the former Ipswich forward was found wanting. Kuqi squandered two excellent opportunities, the first of which arrived just before the half hour mark when Morten Gamst Pedersen's pass bisected Spurs' defence. But Kuqi took his eye off the ball and screwed his shot wide of the post from only eight yards. Pedersen, who was the home side's most penetrative player, carved another opening for Kuqi early in the second half. This time he cut inside before flighting a right-foot cross towards Kuqi. The Finn controlled the ball on his chest but then headed tamely into Robinson's arms. Tottenham's threat was at best sporadic and in a lacklustre first half they managed only one shot on goal, when Reid drilled a speculative drive that Brad Friedel comfortably saved. Robbie Keane and Mido were ineffective in attack and bereft of quality service. Jol's explanation, which suggested he included two players among his substitutes who were carrying injuries, was as unconvincing as his side's performance. \"Michael Carrick had a slight injury after [Saturday's] game,\" said the Spurs manager, \"and Davids had an inflammation of the knee but we have a good squad so that's why we did what we did.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
