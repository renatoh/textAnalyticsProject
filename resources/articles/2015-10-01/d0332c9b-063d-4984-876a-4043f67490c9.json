Fairey was in court for a brief scheduling conference, in a case in which the 45-year-old stands accused of causing more than $20,000 in damages during a visit to Detroit, some of it through the use of wheat paste to stick posters to building walls. In May, Fairey was invited by the billionaire Dan Gilbert to paint several murals in the city, including a 185ft mural on the soaring One Campus Martius building. The high-profile case has attracted international attention, particularly given the intense prosecution of a \u201cquality of life\u201d crime by a city that is still badly affected by violence. The mayor of Detroit, Mike Duggan, has long taken an adversarial stance against graffiti. He has said he expects the alleged vandalism by Fairey to be \u201cinvestigated vigorously\u201d. In a preliminary examination last month, Detroit police sergeant Rebecca McKay said she led a \u201cteam\u201d of investigators to inspect the claims against Fairey. \u201cMy team and myself went out searching for these [unauthorized works],\u201d McKay said. No direct evidence was produced: McKay said none of the building owners witnessed Fairey painting an image, and neither did her officers. \u201cWith my eyes, did I see him do it? No, I did not,\u201d McKay said, adding that building owners identified with works tied to Fairey had not approached the city. When officers contacted the building owners, however, at least eight said they wanted to file complaints. It is unclear if prosecutors have video evidence against Fairey. Detroit officials declined a request for comment by the Guardian. \u201cThe city does not comment on ongoing litigation,\u201d said Detroit corporation counsel Melvin \u201cButch\u201d Hollowell, in a statement to the Guardian. \u201cOur position in this matter will be made in court.\u201d While it is unlikely that the city of Detroit will be able to stop street artists producing unauthorized works, the Duggan administration is adamant that investigating \u201cquality of life\u201d crimes is a priority. Such an approach is a key part of so-called \u201cbroken windows\u201d policing, under which relatively minor crimes are investigated aggressively and which Detroit has adopted in recent years. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re going after violent crime; we\u2019re going after all crime,\u201d Detroit police chief James Craig told the Detroit News in July. That level of persistence, and how it has affected Fairey\u2019s case, is \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, said Matt Eaton, a partner at the Library Street Collective, a gallery that hosted an exhibition of the artist\u2019s work earlier this year. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine this being a source of inspiration for aspiring artists in the city,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cIt definitely gives you pause when deciding to move forward with any public arts initiative.\u201d Jesse Cory, co-owner of local gallery and publisher 1xRUN, said Detroit officials were \u201coverreaching\u201d. The prosecution of Fairey \u201cseems to be more of a communication vehicle\u201d, he said, for city officials to say: \u201c\u2018We\u2019re changing the status quo, starting with this case.\u2019\u201d \u201cMany crimes have been committed for a building to become derelict,\u201d Cory said, \u201cfrom the original owner not paying property taxes, from the scrappers that went in and pulled out all the copper, or the arsonist that set the place on fire. \u201cThe graffiti, or in this case the wheat paste, is the last offense in a series of events for many of the properties that have become a beacon for graffiti.\u201d Cory said, however, that the impact of the Fairey case on the local art community had been limited. If anything, he said, the case had catapulted public art into local dialogue, generating interest in new areas. At a recent mural festival in Detroit\u2019s Eastern Market, which maintains some of the most striking works of public art in the city, Cory said the crowd appeared to come from a \u201cdiverse cross section of demographics in age and race from our entire metro area, that [were] just discovering this contemporary public art\u201d. The festival, indeed, featured a work \u2013 by New York-based Pursue and Kwest from Toronto and featuring a police car with shackled hands protruding from the back window \u2013 that referenced Fairey\u2019s legal battle. Eaton said the city should strive to engage with the arts community for guidance and advice. \u201cCommunication is the key here,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s have a friendly conversation and take a closer look at what constitutes art and how it\u2019s different from vandalism.\u201d The case against Fairey moves along. After prosecutors revealed a spike in the cost of the alleged vandalism, the charges were increased. Fairey is now facing a sentence of up to 10 years, as well as two counts of malicious destruction of a railroad bridge. His attorney, Bradley Friedman, did not respond to requests for comment. Fairey\u2019s next court hearing is set for 10 December. Trial is scheduled for 26 January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
