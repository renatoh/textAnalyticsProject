Two leading building societies, the Yorkshire and the Newcastle, this week announced they are upping the amounts they will allow first-time buyer couples to borrow in order to help those desperate to get a foot on the property ladder. Both have unveiled deals specifically aimed at first-timers. The Newcastle will now lend couples up to 3.75 times their combined income, while the Yorkshire has gone a lot higher. It will allow couples as well as single salary applicants to borrow up to 4.75 times their (joint) income, depending on individual circumstances and provided they sign up for a fixed rate mortgage lasting at least five years. That means a couple earning \u00a350,000 between them could get a loan of up to \u00a3237,500. It is not unusual to hear of lenders offering high \"income multiples\", but these usually relate to single incomes. When it comes to joint income multiples, these traditionally hovered at around the 2.5 to 2.75 times mark but have been been creeping up recently. So why are some banks and building societies increasing the amounts they are prepared to lend, and are they acting responsibly? Some people are likely to take the view that allowing first-time buyers to borrow ever-larger sums at a time when growing numbers of borrowers are buckling under the weight of debts smacks of highly irresponsible lending. But the mortgage industry insists this is not the case and that banks and societies are simply moving with the times. Interest rates are low, and nowadays lenders have much more sophisticated credit profiling and scoring techniques for assessing how much people should be allowed to borrow. Ultimately, they argue that with growing numbers of first-time buyers priced out of the market, bigger loans are the only answer. To coincide with the launch of its new deals, Yorkshire building society published research revealing the \"extreme desperation\" of many of those keen to buy. It found some will go to any lengths to become homeowners, including buying with a partner they don't really want to be with, or lying about their income to get a mortgage. The Yorkshire's 4.75 times joint income multiple would certainly appear to be one of the highest on offer. However, a spokeswoman says it is only offering the higher income multiples on certain first-time buyer deals. These include: \u00b7 A five-year fixed rate \"offset plus\" mortgage where the rate is 5.49% until June 30 2011 for those borrowing 95% of the property's value, or 5.59% until the same date for those borrowing 100%. With this deal, parents (or other relatives) can use their savings to reduce the amount of interest paid, and the loan also offers either 0.6% cashback or free legal fees and refunded valuation. \u00b7 A \"fresh start\" loan where you pay zero interest for the first six months, then 5.49% fixed until August 31 2011 (for those who can raise a 5% deposit. It rises to 5.74% for those borrowing 100%, though there is a \u00a3400 cashback at this higher rate). There is a \u00a3395 fee. Meanwhile, the Newcastle has a new 100% mortgage fixed at 5.89% for five years which comes with free valuation and \u00a3250 cashback. Alternatively, you can pay 5.75% if you forego the cashback and pay a \u00a3300 fee. It says its new higher income multiples (3.75 times joint, four times single) have been coupled with decreased minimum salaries: \u00a317,000 for single applications and a combined \u00a325,000 for joint. So what are other lenders doing? Ray Boulger at mortgage broker John Charcol says it is now quite common to see banks and societies offering 3-3.25 times joint income. \"There are an increasing number that are offering in excess of four times joint and in some cases five or a little over,\" he says. Northern Rock will go above five times joint for couples who take its Together loan, provided they earn enough, have a decent credit score and are happy to take out a five or seven-year fixed rate. Nick Gardner at broker Chase De Vere Mortgage Management says that while the Yorkshire's 4.75 times joint multiple might look high, borrowers are tying themselves into a fixed rate for five years. That means they know their monthly payments are not going to spiral, and hopefully during that time their earnings will increase, making repayments more affordable, he adds. r.jones@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
