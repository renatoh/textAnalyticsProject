Tourists can spend a couple of hours as 'honoured guests' at weddings held at the Mountview Hotel and the Hotel Chandigarh Beckons, as well as a some privately owned venues, mingling with the newlyweds and their families and friends. The local tourist board is asking couples to consider inviting up to 10 foreign guests to their wedding as a 'personal contribution towards promoting the city'. There's no cost involved - you just contact the tourist board if you fancy a shindig. Vivek Atray, director of Chandigarh Tourism, said: 'Weddings in north India are extremely grand occasions and will provide a lot of entertainment for foreign tourists. The idea will be a smash hit.' Contact Chandigarh Tourism on 00 91 172 274 0056 or visit chandigarhtourism.gov.in to find out more."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
