Down to 10 men before half-time, they saw off opponents who had taken what seemed to be an impregnable 2-0 lead on the night. When Lionel Messi struck a penalty against the crossbar and then hit a post, they must have felt their hard work was about to be rewarded. Now Robert Di Matteo's squad will travel to Munich to contest the final without four of their leading figures, all of whom committed the indiscretions that will cost them an appearance on the biggest night of the season. But if the remaining players can produce another performance like this, and continue to ride their luck, Roman Abramovich could finally be seeing the fulfilment of the dream that lured him into football. On a wild and crazy night, the conclusive blow on behalf of a depleted side came from the most unlikely source. Fernando Torres, on the pitch as a late substitute for the majestic Didier Drogba, took advantage of Barcelona's commitment to all-out attack to latch on to a clearance and score the goal that confirmed the victory. After a miserable 15 months at Stamford Bridge the Spaniard has finally written his name into the club's history for something other than his record transfer fee. So who would bet against Chelsea now, in whatever shape they travel to Bavaria on 19 May? This success was a victory for obduracy, pure and simple. In dismissing the challenge of a side generally reckoned to be among the best ever assembled, they demonstrated that defending effectively is just as much of a football skill as the ability to construct attacking moves that ravish the senses. Perhaps styles of play in football are not, after all, a question of morality. Exponents of creative play will always attract admirers who see them as some sort of a force for good, and Barcelona, with Unicef on their shirts and history on their side, explicitly encourage such a response. But now they have sponsorship from Qatar, along with debts of more than half a billion euros, for which they are treated leniently by Spain's tax authorities. Who is to say they are intrinsically worthier than Chelsea, whose backing comes from assets that once belonged to the Russian people and whose football, if more rudimentary, is probably closer to the game as it is played by the majority of the planet? Barcelona started off with their customary 70% of possession and ended up with as close to 100% as you will ever see on a football field, at least at this level. By that time Chelsea had long since lost both their starting centre\u2011backs and their reorganisation was so thorough that for most of the second half Drogba found himself taking up residency at full\u2011back, with notable success. It was a cameo that exemplified the strength of Chelsea's resistance. First the Ivorian stationed himself on the right, where he dispossessed the 20-year-old Isaac Cuenca, part of the latest flowering of talent from La Masia, with contemptuous ease before accelerating up the flank, sweeping Carles Puyol aside and drawing a sprawling save from Victor Vald\u00e9s with a shot from 45 yards. Then he was repositioned on the left, where he successfully shut down the dangerous Dani Alves. The authorities banned bullfighting in Catalunya last year, but there were times on Tuesday night when it seemed as though the corrida had been given a reprieve. As the home side scored their goals, they appeared ready to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce to a wounded and defenceless enemy. But then, on the stroke of half-time, Chelsea dragged themselves back into the contest with a quite marvellous strike. All goals against Barcelona are scored against the run of play, but this was a particular classic, Ramires running on to Frank Lampard's shrewdly judged through pass to lift a nerveless lob over the advancing Vald\u00e9s and, to the astonishment of all present, restore Chelsea's edge in the tie. A sudden flick of the stricken bull's horn, and blood was staining Barcelona's suit of lights. Messi's penalty miss, four minutes into the second half, maintained the little Argentinian's curious barren run against Chelsea, but also illustrated the tension undermining Barcelona's attempts to turn their territorial supremacy into harder currency. As for Chelsea, all they could do was throw everything into the attempt to cling on to their lead. Was it a trick of the imagination, or had the pre-match singing of the Camp Nou's cherished anthem, the Cant del Bar\u00e7a, been delivered with a slightly less assured tone than usual? After two big defeats inside a week, the customary mood of serene anticipation in the bars lining the boulevards around the stadium had seemed tinged with anxiety. Tuesday night's failure may throw doubt on the future of Pep Guardiola, yet to agree a contract for next season. Who could have imagined Di Matteo, sacked by West Bromwich Albion last year and appointed Chelsea's interim manager by Abramovich after the dismissal of Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, getting the better of a man who has won 13 major titles in his four seasons as Barcelona's head coach? Fundamental to Chelsea's success was the feeling that Messi's cape has temporarily lost its power to mesmerise opponents. A negative factor, perhaps, but there was much to admire in the performance of a team who, with blood pouring from a variety of wounds, simply refused to lie down and die. If they are indeed ready to be dragged off to the knacker's yard, they will want one more night of glory first."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
