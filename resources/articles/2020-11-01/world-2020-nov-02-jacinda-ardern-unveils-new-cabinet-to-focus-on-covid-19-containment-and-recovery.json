Robertson, one of Ardern\u2019s most capable ministers and a close ally, handled the government\u2019s spending in response to Covid-19. The government created a NZ$50bn Covid response and recovery fund targeted at new initiatives meant to address both the immediate response to the pandemic and the longer term economic damage left in its wake. Robertson is the first gay man to hold the role of deputy prime minister. \u201cI still get a lot of emails and messages from young gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people who look towards us to provide that kind of role-modelling,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I\u2019ll keep doing my job the way that I\u2019ve been doing it, but I\u2019m very proud to have the role.\u201d Of the 20-strong cabinet, eight are women, five are M\u0101ori, three are Pasifika and three are LGBT. In an unexpected move, Nanaia Mahuta, an MP since 1996, was appointed foreign minister, replacing New Zealand First leader Winston Peters, a populist maverick whose party was not returned to parliament at the election on 17 October. The trailblazing M\u0101ori MP will become the first female foreign minister in New Zealand\u2019s history. Ardern said Mahuta showed \u201cdiplomacy skills that we need to represent New Zealand on the world stage\u201d during her last three years as local government minister. \u201cShe is someone who builds fantastic relationships very, very quickly and that is one of the key jobs in a foreign affairs role,\u201d Ardern said. Mahuta said she was \u201cabsolutely privileged\u201d to take on the job. Mahuta was the first woman to wear a \u201cmoko\u201d, into New Zealand\u2019s parliament after getting the traditional M\u0101ori facial tattoo in 2016, two decades after she was first elected. She has previously held the customs and M\u0101ori development portfolios and will hold on to the local government ministry alongside her foreign responsibilities. Ardern also announced a new ministerial post for Covid-19 response, with Chris Hipkins taking the role. Hipkins took over as health minister in July when David Clark resigned following gaffes including going mountain biking during lockdown. Hipkins responsibilities will include overseeing Covid-19 testing, managed isolation and border controls. He retains the education portfolio. Andrew Little, one of Labour\u2019s most effective ministers, and the politician who begged Ardern to take his place as party leader before coming to power at the 2017 election, takes up the health portfolio. A new MP, Ayesha Verrall, an infectious disease doctor, has been brought straight into cabinet. Verrall was one of the Ardern government\u2019s key scientific advisers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Ardern said it would be foolish at this time not to use Verrall\u2019s experience and said she wanted her voice in cabinet rather than in a consultation role. New Zealand\u2019s response \u2013 to go hard and early on lockdowns \u2013 has been generally praised around the world, moreso as new lockdowns are being announced in Britain and Europe. Four new Covid-19 cases \u2013 all in managed isolation \u2013 were announced today. The last case in the community was 10 days ago, on 23 October. New Zealand has 77 active cases. Its total number of cases is 1603 including 25 deaths. A former prominent cabinet minister, Phil Twyford, paid the price for under-delivery of Kiwibuild \u2013 the programme aimed at addressing homelessness and housing affordability \u2013 and transport projects. He has been given minor portfolios outside cabinet. Green Party leaders James Shaw and Marama Davidson are also ministers outside cabinet \u2013 climate change and family violence portfolios respectively \u2013 having reached a \u201ccooperation\u201d agreement with the government. Under New Zealand\u2019s MMP system, agreements between parties are common, particularly when no one party can form a government alone. In this case the agreement with the Greens was reached even though Labour did not need them to govern. Ardern said all the positions were assigned on merit. \u201cI think one of the amazing things about New Zealand is that we are often in a space now where all of these questions (about diversity) often become secondary,\u201d she said. \u201cThe representation is there. And that is not the first consideration.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
