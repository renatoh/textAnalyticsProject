But in certain situations you are caring for the tree in terms of removing diseased limbs. There's a lot of human terminology. If you're cutting a tree it's not really such drastic surgery if you're taking off dead parts. But it is a bit of an operation. You have to spend quite a long time rigging up devices to lower quite heavy bits of wood if there's a greenhouse underneath it. You may have a tricky job to get up the tree, tie ropes round the limb, have people on the ground and rig up pulleys. It's not all about chopping down trees. If you're caring for a tree you're just removing bits that are going to harm it. If it's got rot, or gangrene in human terms, it's going to find its way into the heart of the stem. If you cut that limb off before it spreads you are in essence protecting the tree. That's the nicer end of the business. There are some brutal ends such as cutting down a nice tree just because someone wants you to, which I don't like and try to avoid doing. Most of the business is in people's gardens here in Glasgow. Tree limbs can block out light or become dangerous when they get older. It's a wonderful job for variety. My favourite job is going up into a big grand beech or elm and taking out the dead wood. People always shout at me: \"It's not falling that's going to hurt you. It's hitting the ground!\" They're trying to wind you up when you're trying to do something tricky. I dread a tree going wrong when I'm trying to fell it, going the wrong way and crashing into someone's house. It would be a nightmare but it hasn't happened yet. A few times heavy limbs have gone whistling a few inches past my leg or my chainsaw's slipped and missed my knee. Touch wood, I've never had an accident but there have been some close shaves where I've gone white. It's a bit hazardous but I've never fallen out of a tree. I'm trying to avoid it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
