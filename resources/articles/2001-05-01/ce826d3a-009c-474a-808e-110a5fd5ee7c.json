But it is this lack of public distinction between the role of these maintenance technicians and that of a career professional engineer which continues to rob many students of a vital and potentially rewarding career in engineering. And, as Tony Price, director of undergraduate studies, school of engineering, University of Warwick points out, this re-education must start at schools. \"Undergraduates are driven toward the subjects that they are familiar with at school and at home. But we still struggle with the fact that, for many, an engineer is someone who fixes the TV.\" It is a situation that just about every university engineering department now faces. But, as students now start to work towards their degrees at school and have to make decisions on their career paths before entering Year 12, it is vital it is tackled now to secure the profession's long term future. After all, the fact is that there are huge opportunities at the moment in the UK engineering field. Just about every discipline has a shortage of good engineers, largely brought about by the decline in admissions over the last few years. This is particularly acute in the civil and chemical disciplines which seem to have suffered greatest from not being considered \"sexy\" enough to school students. Certainly there are some disciplines that remain more popular than others. Electronic engineering, mechanical engineering and anything to do with the computer and communication industry pull in the most students. There are also comparatively modern courses such as materials and integrated general courses which have greater appeal. The profession is trying to change to make engineering more aspirational. \"Students have to have a broad notion of what they want to do while at school,\" says Price. \"But it is a mistake to think of engineering as a purely vocational subject.\" Unfortunately, it is still true that many conventional engineering careers attract woeful salaries. But it is also true that within each engineering discipline there is a wide range of potential employers and a wide range of potential career paths and salaries available. Professor Richard Chaplin, head of the department of engineering at Reading University, explains: \"It is our experience that, in comparison to our peers, more of Reading's students actually stay in engineering when they graduate. But engineering degrees prepare students for many other careers. This seems particularly so in civil engineering.\" However, recent changes by the Engineering Council, the profession's over-arching registration body, have been introduced to try to raise the academic entry level for chartered engineers. This means that all courses accredited by the EngC are now four year MEng qualifications and usually require students to have at least 24 A-level grade points to be accepted. This has been a tough challenge for the profession, particularly in disciplines such as civil engineering which, historically, have had a high degree of practical training. As a result, there are many other routes to, and types of, professional qualification now available to suit a variety of career paths. It is fair to say, however, that in most cases becoming chartered is still the ultimate goal of a professional engineer. And the reason is simply that, again in most cases, the financial rewards are greater after this qualification is achieved. But this greater emphasis on potential earnings has, according to John Williams, deputy head of the engineering department at Cambridge University, been forced much higher in students' minds today. \"The fact that students now graduate with a significant debt means that they are far more attuned to jobs and careers,\" he says. \"However, it is a fact that Cambridge engineering students have the highest starting salaries of any university, and after graduation 50% stay in industry, 20% go into management consultancy, 15% go into higher degrees and the rest end up as civil servants, in the city or as teachers.\" Of course not all universities are blessed with the ability to attract the brightest students in the same way that Cambridge can. However, even the best engineering departments seem to be inheriting problems from the changing basic education system in the UK. \"There are big gaps in student knowledge coming into university,\" says Colin Kerr, head of administration at Imperial College, London. \"A student may have an A-level in maths but that does not necessarily mean that they have the bedrock skills in calculus and statistics.\" This quite often means universities having to adapt courses to give students the necessary help getting up to basic levels of understanding. But, on the brighter note, the popularity of gap years seems to be helping potential engineering undergraduates and is generally encouraged by universities, particularly if it involves some element of industrial placement. This clearly gives students some real industry experience and helps to put learning into context. Teaching standards remain generally high in engineering but there is real concern in many disciplines about how this will be maintained. Most of the top universities for teaching also have high research ratings and there is a clear link between the two. It is widely acknowledged that the cash that usually accompanies research helps bolster the teaching resources. But in an industry facing severe skills shortages, this resource is becoming harder and harder to find. Professor Adrian Long, dean of the faculty of engineering at Queens University Belfast, has his fears. He recently surveyed around 40 engineering departments at universities in the UK and his results, so far unpublished, show that most are having critical problems finding enough of the right teachers. \"There is potentially a very damaging situation developing for engineering and one that the government should be lobbied to turn around,\" he warns. \"The simple fact is that in many disciplines, notably computer science and communication-related subjects, the industry is always prepared to pay higher salaries.\" General engineering General engineering degree courses avoid the need to specialise too early in your career. But beware, if you want to become a professional chartered engineer, make sure that the general degree you choose is accredited by a professional institution. Growth in the general engineering course is a throwback to the original Oxbridge engineering courses. These give a rounded grounding before allowing students to choose a specific discipline, such as electrical, mechanical or civil in which to graduate. The model is still particularly successful at these traditional universities with Imperial College, Oxford and Cambridge head and shoulders above the rest. Colin Kerr head of administration at Imperial College London explains that it is becoming increasingly important to offer students flexibility in courses. \"There is now a greater link between university, careers and jobs,\" he says. \"It is scary but kids are thinking seriously about what career they want at 15 years old. But, for example, the average 14-year-old has no appreciation of civil engineering or the role of civil engineers.\" It is important to find out how the course is structured as general engineering degrees can vary hugely. University of Warwick, for example, also offers courses with integration between disciplines rather than commonality of subjects. The hope is to attract more of the brighter students and to give them access to a better career path and salary structure. Materials Materials engineering is increasing in popularity largely due to its non-traditional status and industrial links. However, there are comparatively few universities offering the course as it remains a specialist interest area and is an expensive course to run. John Williams, deputy head of the engineering department at Cambridge University, which came way out ahead in the Guardian's teaching assessment table explains: \"We still have a separate material science department but at many other universities they have been absorbed into the engineering departments. There are perhaps only five or six true materials departments left in the UK. This is the trend.\" Cambridge also again scored a high value-added rating, indicating the number of students converting lower A-level grades into upper second and first class degrees. Chemical Bizarrely, chemical engineering is going through a difficult time at university. It is strange because, almost without exception, university engineering departments report that this discipline offers one of the best career potentials. John Williams, deputy head of the engineering department at Cambridge University confirms this problem. \"Chemical engineering is struggling. Maybe it is a perception problem. The fact is that salaries for chemical engineering graduates are still the highest.\" One theory lies in the fact that chemistry at school is seen as too difficult and often lacking in real life application. There is also evidence that students are shying away from working with what is considered to be an environmentally unfriendly chemical industry. While Cambridge has returned by far the highest teachig ranking in the survey, the University of Wales, Swansea, has a particularly high value-added score reflecting the fact that it is the only university in Wales to offer Chemical Engineering. Electrical and electronic Queens University Belfast leads the way in electrical engineering, both in terms of overall teaching quality but also in value-added rating, showing that it is able to take lower A-level standard students and turn out high class degree graduates. Professor Adrian Long, dean of the faculty of engineering explains: \"We are fairly buoyant in terms of student numbers. We are fortunate that we can recruit top quality students.\" He adds: \"In comparison to the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland still recognises a link between engineering and technology. There is still a high regard for engineering. Virtually all our UK students are from Northern Ireland where we still have the old grammar system. I think that this helps us get better academic results.\" Electrical and particularly electronic engineering are among the few disciplines to benefit from public perception. There is a very close link with computers, and students are familiar with this technology. However, Long warns against simply following fashion: \"One thing that I always try to emphasise to students is the huge variety and challenge in an engineering career. But it is a fact that, compared to careers such as management consultancy, salaries are much too low for the quality of the graduates.\" Civil Civil engineering, of all the disciplines, has had a tough time attracting university applicants. The industry is misunderstood, it has a bad reputation and is not renowned for paying well. However, while much of this is justified, the reality is that the current skill shortage is biting and tending to push up salaries and enhance careers. University of Wales, Swansea, comes out top in the Guardian teaching assessments, in part due to its record of delivering good quality graduates from lower entry candidates. Professor Bob Cryan, dean of engineering is not surprised. \"Civil engineering is a five star research rated department and this has definitely pushed the standard. We have a very highly rated teaching department and I personally believe that the two are closely linked.\" Civil engineering does offer huge variety. There is strong practical element to the career but it also offers opportunities in design, management and the environment. Recent changes in routes to becoming chartered have also had a huge impact on the civil engineering profession. The result is that membership of the professional body, the Institution of Civil Engineers has been widened to reflect the huge breadth of talents needed in this diverse industry. It also continues to be more attractive to women engineers at university, although the number actually making it through to working in industry is still far too low. Mechanical Good research is related to good-quality teaching, according to Dr Steve Pickering, senior admissions tutor at Nottingham University's school of mechanical engineering, materials and manufacturing science and management. Nottingham is top of the Guardian's teaching assessment league for mechanical engineering. \"We have a rigorous feedback system from the students and so are very aware all the time of teaching problems arising,\" he says. \"It is very important that we maintain a good-quality course. We want to keep students applying to Nottingham, but we also want to keep the industry happy.\" Mechanical engineering is the most popular discipline at Nottingham and accounts for 30% of admissions. The perception of the industry has a huge impact on popularity and, for example, explains Pickering, the manufacturing sector is suffering - perhaps because the industry is perceived to be in decline. But he adds: \"Certainly at school, students do not really understand what some courses are all about.\" Nottingham also has a good value-added rating, indicating that it is able to return good quality graduates from lower graded A-level students. The course also has the advantage of now being embedded within a larger and more wide-ranging department which helps give students a broader understanding. \"We are seeing many of the traditionally separate engineering disciplines merging into single departments at universities,\" says Pickering. \"Of course this does bring economies of scale but can also help to improve synergies between the different skills.\" \u0095 Antony Oliver is editor of New Civil Engineer magazine.
