The husband and wife team, known as Eley Kishimoto, started off creating some of the most copied and much loved textile prints for a number of fashion houses in the Nineties, and progressed to making their own clothes to show off their prints in 1996. Their collections are now sold around the world. If you like their quirky aesthetic, these are clothes that will never go out of fashion. You simply add to your collection season by season. And for the past few years, they have been adding their own brand of surface decoration to china tea sets, chairs, a limited edition of Globetrotter suitcases (the ultimate luxury), speakers, record covers, and logically enough, wallpapers. But this week, their most ambitious project has gone on show - at a stately home in Northumberland. Not content with printing on paper and fabric, they have printed on concrete. Eley Kishimoto are among 13 fashion designers who have been given free rein to create an installation at Belsay Hall. The English Heritage neo-classical mansion with a 14th-century castle and formidable gardens will be decorated by Alexander McQueen, Stella McCartney, Julie Verhoeven, Clements Ribeiro, Paul Smith and Zandra Rhodes for a show called FAB (short for Fashion at Belsay). Eley Kishimoto were familiar with the building, having designed a 150-seater sofa as part of an exhibition of chairs and seating held there in 2002. McCartney has taken up residence in the great hall of the castle, Julie Verhoeven is in the gardens, and Agent Provocateur is in a bedroom. The Eley Kishimoto installation is in the drawing room. They have worked with Tom Emerson of architecture practice 6a. 'We wanted to do something in a field we hadn't worked in before,' says Mark Eley. 'It's a model - the start of a relationship.' They have applied their silk-screen printing techniques to concrete panels. 'It's very simple. We've created interior and exterior spaces with structures like little towers and a vista down the middle so it is like walking down a street.' It seems that Eley Kishimoto have their sights set beyond simply decorating clothes (the duo's first menswear collection is launched next year) and the odd home accessory. 'We want to deal with dressing the exterior of buildings, public spaces. We want to make them patterned and bring clothes to the environment.' This is not such a pie-in-the-sky idea. Designer Thomas Heatherwick has paved the way with his Blue Carpet in Newcastle, a public artwork made out of masonry and forming a 'carpet' in the square outside the city's Laing Art Gallery. Patterned paving stones in a city square, or printed park benches, or even street furniture isn't such a bad idea. The cladding technique could even be applied to some of the country's more brutal concrete tower blocks. The possibilities are endless. Tom Emerson agrees. 'Modern architecture is interested once again in decoration,' he says. 'Printed buildings is something we will see people experimenting with more and more.' They have already worked on projects that involved printing on glass or polycarbonate, and point out that buildings have been decorated with scraffiti - layers of different coloured plaster with patterns scratched back into it - for centuries. Herzog and de Meuron have also printed on concrete. 'Belsay is a fantastic setting,' says Emerson. 'It has repeated patterns throughout the architecture so everything has a rhyme. We decided to print on everyday materials, cement and plasterboard. The print transforms it into something extraordinary and refined.' Eley Kishimoto recently signed a licensing deal with an Italian manufacturer, freeing them up to concentrate on growing the company and experimenting with their prints - they have sold to 20 new stores in Italy alone. They are collaborating with a new sportswear/ fashion concept with Ellesse for spring/summer 2005, and their store, tucked away in a quiet street in Borough in southeast London, is becoming a place of pilgrimage for die-hard fans. There, you can see the full range of their work, including the colourful tea sets and the furniture developed in collaboration with Typical, run by interior designer and entrepreneur Jason Maclean. Their printed Hobnob chair was a discovery Maclean made on his travels in Australia - made by a company which was still producing them using an original mould from the Fifties. Eley Kishimoto simply added a print and transformed an old design. As the designers insist, it's amazing what a bit of print can do. And if they have their way, it's something we'll be seeing a lot more of, in places we least expect. \u00b7 Admission to FAB is included in the entrance to Belsay Hall, Northumberland, open daily from 10am-6pm, until 30 September (01661 881 636).Typical Eley Kishimoto is at 40 Snowsfields, London SE1 (020 7357 0037)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
