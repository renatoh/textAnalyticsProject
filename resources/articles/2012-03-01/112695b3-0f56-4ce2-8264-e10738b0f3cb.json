It can pay off the headhunters before phoning that nice Mr Mallett in Cape Town with an apology for having led him to understand, in all good faith, that there might be a well-paid job waiting for him at Twickenham. The job is already being done and, whatever Ireland manage to conjure up at Twickenham on St Patrick's Day, in the final match of the tournament, Stuart Lancaster has made an unanswerable case for promotion from caretaker to permanent head coach. As it happens, England are still in with a remote arithmetical possibility of winning the championship, were events to swing wildly to their advantage at home and in Cardiff on Saturday. At the end of a competition in which they have won all their three away matches for the first time since the tournament expanded to become the Six Nations 13 years ago, who would say they had not deserved it? Everything we have seen of Lancaster in recent weeks suggests that he is a coach of vision and integrity as well as a modest and straightforward man. Just as important: he also seems to be a lucky coach, thus satisfying Napoleon's requirement of his generals. The match was in its final minute, with the score at 22-24 and England hanging on by their bruised fingertips, when France went about the business of working themselves into a position from which to score the drop goal that would have secured the win and changed all sorts of destinies. When the necessary platform had been steadied and the ball came back, it landed in the hands of Fran\u00e7ois Trinh-Duc, who had been on the field barely five minutes after replacing Lionel Beauxis, the fly-half who had taken his place in the starting lineup. Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 had included Beauxis for his powerful kicking repertoire, which includes drop goals. Had he been on the field, no one would have bet against the Toulouse man nailing an effort from 35 metres and sending the Stade de France into a paroxysm of ecstasy. Instead it was Trinh-Duc who was given the responsibility and, despite being put in possession with ample time and space, he muffed his attempt quite hideously. If that was an example of Lancaster's luck, England will be wanting more of it. But luck must be subservient to other qualities such as strategic wisdom, tactical intelligence and motivational ability, each of which Lancaster, below, has demonstrated during this campaign. Perhaps best of all, he has shown that he can make a side believe in their ability to win. All three of England's away victories have featured narrow margins: 6-13 in Edinburgh, 15-19 in Rome and now 22-24 in Paris. The only home match played to date resulted in a 12-19 defeat by Wales. No more than a single score divided the sides in any of these four matches, but it would be a serious mistake to assume that this indicates a straitened approach to the task of playing tournament rugby. Some might say that England's resources, unparalleled in the world of rugby, oblige them to win matches by emphatic margins all the time while putting on the sort of exhibition associated in the minds of the Twickenham public with names such as David Duckham, Rory Underwood and Jason Robinson. But Lancaster was invited to pick up the England squad at a time when their morale and reputation were at the lowest level in living memory and just after they had managed to damage the standing of the giant figure who captained them to their greatest triumph. It was a hugely daunting task, perhaps one encouraging caution in a caretaker, but Lancaster, having accepted the commission, made it clear that he was going to do the job according to his own principles, using the benefit of the experience accrued during his time with the Saxons. England may not have accomplished all the things they would like to have done during the handful of weeks since he took over but the clear signs of positive evolution were visible in Sunday's opening stages, when their fluency and imagination surprised France. And as the match neared its shuddering conclusion, their firm-jawed resistance was embodied in the full-on tackle made by Owen Farrell to stop a dangerous French attack after Aur\u00e9lien Rougerie had broken clear and steamed towards England's 22. It might not seem as important but Lancaster has also banished the surliness that characterised the squad in good times as well as bad. The RFU board should go ahead and make the decision now. Whether by luck or judgment, they find themselves in an ideal position. Even they can hardly blow this one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
