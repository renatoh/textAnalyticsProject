Virginia Giuffre said on Twitter on Tuesday: \u201cI\u2019m so scared right now, having trouble breathing, fever &amp; cough. Getting tested for Covid-19 praying it\u2019s not positive.\u201d She posted a picture of herself wearing a mask and lying in a hospital bed. She thanked wellwishers and said she was sure she \u201cwould be fine\u201d, but added that she hated hospitals and had had \u201cquite a few bad experiences in my time\u201d. Giuffre, 35, who is based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, alleges she was trafficked to London while working for Prince Andrew\u2019s friend Jeffrey Epstein. She heaped pressure on Andrew in December when she gave an interview to the BBC in which she repeated allegations that she had sex with the prince when she was 17. She alleges this was done on the instructions of Ghislaine Maxwell, a socialite and close friend of Epstein, the US financier and sex offender who killed himself in August. Andrew has categorically denied all claims of wrongdoing and maintains that he has \u201cno recollection\u201d of meeting Giuffre, although he was photographed with his arm around her. Giuffre\u2019s health fears have not stopped her from keeping up the pressure on the prince. In a separate comment on Tuesday, she railed against \u201cBS answers\u201d and said it was time to change laws around statutes of limitations. Last month, a New York prosecutor said Andrew had \u201ccompletely shut the door\u201d on cooperating with US investigators in the Epstein case and his office was considering further options. Andrew had said in November last year he was \u201cwilling to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations if required\u201d. In the December BBC interview, Giuffre said: \u201cHe knows what happened, I know what happened, and there\u2019s only one of us telling the truth, and I know that\u2019s me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
