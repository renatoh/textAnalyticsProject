I couldn't help feeling that each of these lavish productions felt slightly fin-de-si\u00e8cle \u2013 the last of the really luxurious premieres before funding cuts hit? It seemed to me that, of all these pieces, it is Alice that will have the greatest staying power. I can easily see it in the Royal's repertory in 30 years' time. It is by no means a perfect piece: it is a bit too choppily action-packed and abrupt, and one would have liked more moments when the stage cleared and the dancers simply danced; nor does it exactly push back the boundaries of the art form. But it is certainly a fantastically entertaining show. Crucially, it contains both magic for the kids and enough in-jokes to keep grown-up balletomanes happy, with sly references to Ashton, Balanchine, Tchaikovsky, Minkus and more. A special pleasure of the premiere was Zenaida Yanowsky's Red Queen. She's always been a wonderfully intelligent dancer; now she's revealed as a supremely gifted comedian. She and Simon Russell Beale's Duchess were a hoot. Will a toothbrush collection win the Art Fund Museums prize? This year I'm one of the judges, along with others including Lola Young, Jeremy Deller and chairman Michael Portillo, choosing the winner of the \u00a3100,000 Art Fund Museums prize. We have already selected the longlist of 10, and now we embark the fun bit: visits to the museums \u2013 spread as far north as Ayrshire (the Robert Burns Museum) and west as Llandudno (the Mostyn). First up was the utterly delightful Hertford Museum, home of the country's largest toothbrush collection (what's not to like?). It's the very model of a small local museum, absolutely embedded in its community, bursting with intriguing treasures \u2013 from the rather alarming stuffed hornbill in the stores to an intricately stitched 19th-century shepherd's smock straight out of a Hardy novel, and an exquisite medieval reliquary. Jeremy and I will be recording each visit \u2013 he in pictures, me in words \u2013 on my blog in due course. Forest Fringe uprooted Bad news from Edinburgh: the Forest Caf\u00e9, home of Forest Fringe, the most inventive and fresh theatre and performance art you'll see during the August festivals, is in the process of being sold from under the feet of the artists' collective who lease the building year-round. The identity of the buyer is not known, but rumours circulate about a chain coffee shop: and what a shame it would be for this quirky, rough-round-the-edges space to be brought into anonymous corporate line. If the sale goes through, this August would be the last that the Forest Fringe, directed by Andy Field and Deborah Pearson, would be able to operate out of the cafe. Still, my guess is that \u2013 ingenious and bright as they are \u2013 they will find a new home."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
