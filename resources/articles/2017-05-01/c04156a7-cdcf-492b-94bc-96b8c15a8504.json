And you know what? Good. I\u2019m glad. Bring it on. What else have you got? Tell me there\u2019s cyanide in the water, cat wee in milk and mercury in apples. Reveal that vegetables bring on rickets, porridge triggers heart disease and every child that hasn\u2019t had a daily beaker of scotch since birth is doomed. Throw everything you\u2019ve got at my baffled, anxious, well-meaning mother\u2019s brain. I\u2019m done. Yesterday was my daughter\u2019s second birthday; we achieved our dream of getting her through the first two years without added salt or sugar and that is it: from now on she\u2019ll be on an exclusive diet of Mars bars, turkey twizzlers and gin. Well done us! In two whole years, we never gave her salt or sugar! Arsenic, yes. More arsenic than you\u2019d find in the complete works of Agatha Christie. Really ladled it into her, the old arsenic. Magnificent. Saw us right through the weaning phase. Thanks to the news, I will forever look back on October 2015 to April 2016 as the period when I went out at least twice a week and walked round the supermarket or greengrocer\u2019s, selecting the freshest bunches of spinach or kale or cabbage or carrots, paying the mark-up for organic versions, scrubbing off the earth until my hands were raw\u2026 then every day, every single day, hunched over the hob, lightly and carefully steaming the day\u2019s allocation\u2026 pureeing them in the vegetable water to preserve the vitamins\u2026 washing up the pot, the blending bowl, the blades\u2026 and then, last of all, the final flourish, just before spooning the results into my daughter: stirring in a \u201cdangerously large amount\u201d of arsenic. Terrific. I say \u201cevery day\u201d. I mean most days. Sometimes we travelled. We\u2019ve managed the odd night away, weekend away, even fortnight away, in the two years since she was born. On those occasions, I carried ready meals \u2013 but not just any old ready meals, special healthy ready meals, don\u2019t worry about that. When going on proper holidays, I actually spent money sending boxes of them to myself in foreign countries. Oh yes! International postage! God forbid I would risk being stuck abroad with the little one, separated from my trusty pans and blender, forced to feed her something that\u2019s been cooked with a knob of salted butter or a sprinkle of caster sugar. Why would I risk that, when I could spend vast amounts of time and money supplying myself with packages of special healthy meals that now turn out to contain so much fruit juice and \u201cagave syrup\u201d that I might as well have turned her upside down and squeezed a 500g bottle of treacle into her? I\u2019m not complaining about the time spent. That\u2019s how I wanted to spend my time. Different people react to parenthood in different ways. Many of my closest friends, who love their children immeasurably and certainly as much as I love mine, need space from them. Quite apart from the financial imperative, they need for their own sanity to create separate professional achievements, maintain separate relationships or just have quiet days off. That\u2019s not how it\u2019s been for me. To my surprise, it turned out that I find childcare infinitely interesting. It\u2019s more rewarding than anything else I do and there\u2019s no real peace or pleasure in being away from her. I\u2019ve kept working a bit, but only to try and have some sort of skeleton career going for the future. The sad thing is, I thought I\u2019d done well with the food. I\u2019d estimate that 80% of my satisfaction in the job of parenting is seeing her hunger assuaged with proper nutritional goodness: vitamins and minerals, fruit and veg, like watering a tiny plant, scattering it with tomato feed and standing back to watch it grow. I\u2019m a terrible mother in so many ways, but, when it comes to mealtimes, I\u2019ve really put in the elbow grease. And the arsenic. Then there\u2019s the special \u201cbaby cereal\u201d that turned out to be vastly more sugary than Weetabix\u2026 the special \u201cfollow on\u201d toddler milk, \u201cpacked with goodness\u201d, that turns out to have contributed to a national children\u2019s dental crisis\u2026 So it\u2019s not the time I mourn, it\u2019s the job satisfaction. The pride and self-worth derived, then snatched away \u2013 as if you\u2019d spent two years working on an office report, handed it in and watched the boss laugh as he set fire to it. This wasn\u2019t about being a faddy, trendy, Gwyneth Paltrow of a parent. I saw the raised eyebrows of the older generation when they noticed she doesn\u2019t have sweets or ice cream, orange squash or milkshakes. They wanted to say (but knew not to): get over yourself, that stuff was good enough for you at her age! And I wanted to say (but didn\u2019t): I\u2019m trying to recreate exactly what it was like at my age, when there wasn\u2019t so much sugar in everything else! We\u2019re told there are spooky additives in everyday groceries! I\u2019m just trying to give her the chance to develop a normal, human, non-American palate! But, like William Goldman said about the film industry, nobody knows anything. They didn\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know. So perhaps it should just be Mars bars and turkey twizzlers from now on; toffee apples and videogames, cans of Pepsi and 18-rated films. If we can\u2019t manage \u201chealthy\u201d, we could at least offer fun. Problem is, the plan worked too well: her tastes are set now. She won\u2019t want cupcakes and iPads, she\u2019s too keen on wooden toys and spinach. And arsenic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
