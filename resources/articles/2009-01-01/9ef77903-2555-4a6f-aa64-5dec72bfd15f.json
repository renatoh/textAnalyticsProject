President Barack Obama had barely let go of the Bible on which he had sworn the oath of office before the front page of the White House website had been radically altered. At 12.01pm eastern standard time, out went the rather text-heavy Bush administration front page on whitehouse.gov, with its sections on: Global War on Terror; the Freedom Agenda; the Bush Record and Mrs Bush's Leadership. Instead those clicking on it were welcomed by a smiling photograph of President Obama under the headline : \"Change has come to America\", along with a gallery of images that included the whole Obama family getting out and interacting with the community and text sections on subjects such as Honouring Dr King's Legacy and Serving America. A video of The Whistle Stop Tour showed Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, vice-president Joe Biden, and his wife Dr Jill Biden \"following the same route that Abraham Lincoln rode 150 years ago \u2026 [on] their way to the inauguration on a whistle stop train tour that wove its way from Philadelphia through Delaware and Maryland on its way to Washington\". Before midday, the website had a picture of George Bush, holding hands with Laura Bush making their way along a red carpet laid outside the north portico of the White House. It now says: \"WhiteHouse.gov will be a central part of President Obama's pledge to make his the most transparent and accountable administration in American history.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
