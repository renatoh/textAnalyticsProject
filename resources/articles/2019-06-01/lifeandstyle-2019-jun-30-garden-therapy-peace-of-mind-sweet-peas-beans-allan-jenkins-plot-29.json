I had wanted rest and to recuperate. My bones ache, my heart too, but gardening is therapy. I had run out of time the night before, stuff left undone. So I am at the allotment, Monday morning before 5am, almost no one else on the road. At the gate, it is just me and the joyful chorus. My troubled world suspends, almost disappears. My breathing and pulse rate slow. I will drift awhile in the moment. I have trays of beans seedlings to put in next to the new poles. The sweet peas can wait for now. I had toyed with the idea of a row of single stakes, but there is something comforting about tying them all in together. The soil is soft here at this end of the gentle slope. I work my way around the poles, five sticks wide, times two. I plant four, sometimes five seedlings for each pole, something of an insurance (I hope) against pigeons and slugs. And, anyway, it will be a while yet until we have too many beans. I water them in with a seaweed mix to ease the move to adulthood. I am joined by robins and blackbirds. Chatter from the trees. By 6am I am done. I have forgotten my aches. My concerns have receded. And there is still time for a walk and a bath before breakfast. I will be back later in the week when I can steal another hour (or three). We still have to sort where the sweet peas will go. Many we will share with friends and family, the tomatoes, too (Howard tells me we have \u2018hundreds\u2019 more in his greenhouse). Our first summer structure is up and primed. There will be beans and sweet peas. And peace of mind.
