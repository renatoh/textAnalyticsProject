The letter bomb, addressed to Gary Titley, the leader of the UK Labour members of the European parliament, was opened by a member of staff in his office at Radcliffe, Greater Manchester. Nobody was hurt. Mr Titley said: \"This morning, a member of my staff opened a package addressed to me, and it immediately caught fire. \"Thankfully, no one was physically injured, though obviously this was a shocking incident. There can be no justification for these attacks, which in reality are an attack on democracy.\" Earlier today, a letter bomb exploded at the European parliament headquarters in Brussels. It was addressed to Hans-Gert Poettering, the head of the German Christian Democrat party, and was opened by a female employee, who was unhurt in the incident. At least one other letter bomb was sent to the European parliament headquarters, and was addressed to the head of the Spanish conservatives, Jose Ignacio Salafranca, but did not explode. Earlier reports claimed that a third device had been sent today. Officials said that at least five letter bombs, postmarked Bologna, had been sent to MEPs or officials since December 22. All were in brown paper packages. Investigators are exploring possible links with Italian anarchist groups who claimed responsibility for the earlier bombs and say they are targeting \"the new European political order\", according to the Press Association. The latest packages to arrive in Brussels appeared to have passed through security screening operations before the earlier devices had alerted staff to a Bologna-based threat. The parcels were then sent on to the offices of the MEPs, where they remained during the fortnight-long Christmas break. Previous letter bombs were sent to the Bologna home of the European Commission president, Romano Prodi, the head of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, Jean-Claude Trichet, the offices of Europol, an EU police data-gathering centre in the Hague, and cross-border crime body Eurojust. European parliament spokesman David Harley said that a security review was under way. \"The Belgian police are now working with our security services to re-scan the tens of thousands of packages which have been sent to the European parliament in recent weeks,\" he said. \"We are relieved that no one was hurt or injured. We are concerned that, out of the tens of thousands of packages received in recent weeks, one or two have apparently slipped through the security net. \"We will be carrying out an inquiry later today to assess what further security measures may be required. We are confident, but not complacent, that the situation can be returned to normal as soon as possible.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
