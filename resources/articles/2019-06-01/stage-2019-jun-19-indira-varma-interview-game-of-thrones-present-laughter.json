The actor is recalling the howl she lets out in season four of Game of Thrones, after her lover Oberyn has his eyes gouged out by a hulking brute called the Mountain. Splatter flies and we cut to her character, Ellaria, who gives a blood-curdling screech. What personal demons, I wonder, was Varma summoning to produce that? \u201cIt was the last thing they shot that day,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI had one go. We were losing the light. So it\u2019s like\u2026\u201d She draws a breath and drags out an expletive until her voice squeaks. Then she says with a shrug: \u201cYou have to deliver.\u201d Varma, who has triumphed in Shakespeare, Shaw, Pinter and Hare, is now starring in No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s Present Laughter at the London theatre. But she\u2019s still best known as ruthless Ellaria, who we first meet embarking on a foursome with Oberyn and is usually to be seen writhing at his side, or scheming with her Sand Snake daughters. In Matthew Warchus\u2019s production of Coward\u2019s 1939 comedy, Andrew Scott dons theatre\u2019s most famous dressing gown to play the tousled matinee idol Garry Essendine. Varma is Liz, who never got round to divorcing Garry and manages his career with utmost pragmatism. This involves navigating his dalliances with debutantes and, in a fresh gender-switch, with predatory male actor Joe (Joanna in Coward\u2019s original). Coolheaded, elegant, shrewd: there\u2019s a hint of Liz to Varma, who illustrates points with gestures placed as carefully as her words are chosen. \u201cLiz is the one person who is direct with Garry, so he values that relationship. He is pulled in every direction by flattery and adulation. The thing about Liz that I love is she walked away from the marriage. She\u2019s really powerful.\u201d This is Varma\u2019s second Coward \u2013 she did The Vortex at the Donmar in 2002. I presume she saw his plays growing up in well-heeled Bath? Apparently not. \u201cBut I used to queue up for the Theatre Royal because they did \u00a31 standing room tickets. I saw Lettice and Lovage with Maggie Smith. It blew my mind.\u201d What else excited her? \u201cPeople laugh but I love mime. I feel sad because I\u2019ve kind of let it go.\u201d Her career took her through different doors, she says. I picture Varma shutting out Marcel Marceau in a sad little mime. She might find a way back in, she insists \u2013 \u201ca cat flap into that world\u201d. Varma, who is 45, was raised in an arty home by her Swiss mother (a graphic designer) and Indian father (an illustrator). Were they keen on her having an acting career? \u201cMy dad wasn\u2019t. He\u2019d just throw at me, \u2018You should be a doctor.\u2019 Utterly ludicrous. I was crap at science.\u201d She went off to Rada. How was that? After a slight sigh, she talks instead about the fun of acting as a child: \u201cThere\u2019s something so pure about being able to mess about, where there are no expectations.\u201d She then remembers Rada as \u201cgreat but quite intimidating\u201d. There is a pause. \u201cWe all go through moments of self-doubt and going, \u2018I\u2019m the mistake.\u2019 Or, \u2018Maybe I\u2019m not right for this. I don\u2019t fit into what I think the theatre world is. I\u2019m not useful to that world yet.\u2019 To begin with, I felt like that.\u201d She graduated in 1995 and Mira Nair cast her as a servant turned courtesan in Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love, inspired by the ancient Hindu text. Nair was impressed by her \u201cwilful gaze and imperiousness\u201d and the film, shot in central India, was a \u201cbaptism of fire\u201d says Varma. At 21, she hadn\u2019t trained for film nor grown up on movies. Here she was debuting in a leading role requiring considerable nudity. \u201cIt was the first time I had to lose weight. I\u2019d prided myself on being me \u2013 take me as I am! But the reality is that you\u2019re there to serve the material. Suddenly you\u2019re having to change yourself a little to fit this ideal.\u201d She lost confidence and grew angry. But did she have a lot of trust in Nair as a director? \u201cYeah \u2013 and as a woman,\u201d she says. I ask if Kama Sutra narrowed the roles she was offered. \u201cOh God, yeah,\u201d she says twice. \u201cMy name\u2019s Indira Varma. It\u2019s an Indian name. And I think, you know, if I had a Spanish name, people would maybe think I was Spanish. If I had a North African name, also. If I had an English name, I might be seen differently.\u201d At drama school, one teacher suggested she change it but she thought: \u201cI\u2019m going to forge a path for those with foreign names!\u201d Another encouraged her to keep it. \u201cI\u2019ve always been torn by that decision. I\u2019m still in the business and I\u2019m here at the Old Vic, but there have been moments where I\u2019ve thought: bloody hell, I\u2019ve missed out on that because actually they liked the tape and then someone went, \u2018Bit too Asian \u2013 not really what we\u2019re looking for.\u2019\u201d At Rada, Varma had been cast as an old man \u2013 \u201cand as a parrot!\u201d But after Kama Sutra, she says, \u201call I was being offered was Indian exotica, women who take their clothes off\u201d. She concentrated on theatre, playing Phoebe in As You Like It (opposite Stephen Mangan) and Bianca in Othello (directed by Sam Mendes). She had the distinction of not just doing Pinter but also starring with and being directed by the great playwright. She does an impressive Pinter impersonation, recreating his words of advice: \u201cNothing you do is wrong.\u201d She laughs and explains he wasn\u2019t talking \u201cto me personally, daaarling! But if you are truthful, then nothing you do is wrong. That is the most liberating thing you can say to an actor.\u201d Back on screen, Varma was a hoot in matching Burberry cap and bikini in Bride and Prejudice, Gurinder Chadha\u2019s Bollywood Austen makeover, looking on aloof in the Caroline Bingley role. On telly, in the satirical Broken News, she was newsreader Melanie Bellamy, frantically pacing around a studio. In Luther, she played humanitarian lawyer Zoe, whose grace contrasts with her explosive detective husband (Idris Elba). She was superb in Patrick Melrose, too, wracked with concern for Melrose\u2019s mother Eleanor as they share a Ferris wheel. This summer, she appears in Official Secrets, a film about GCHQ whistleblower Katharine Gun. She plays Shami Chakrabarti, the former director of Liberty who invited Varma to tea at the House of Lords. \u201cI look nothing like her,\u201d she says, \u201cand she\u2019s half my size.\u201d Varma has just done a TV pilot, For Life, playing a gay prison warden. Curtis \u201c50 Cent\u201d Jackson is involved. \u201cHe\u2019s done some music for it!\u201d she laughs. \u201cReally cool!\u201d Her industry, Varma says, requires actors to be Teflon on the outside but able to access their vulnerabilities in performance. \u201cIt\u2019s a paradox.\u201d She aspires to something similar when performing: \u201cI\u2019m in control of it but also not giving a fuck, so anything can happen. That tension is what it\u2019s all about.\u201d Does she carry characters around with her during rehearsals? \u201cPrior to having a child, it was all-consuming.\u201d Now Varma has a daughter with actor Colin Tierney, she switches off more easily \u2013 although they\u2019ve been telling her to stop talking so loudly, reminding her she\u2019s not on the Old Vic stage yet. Several Thrones stars are doing theatre in London this summer: Gwendoline Christie is playing Titania, Julian Glover is doing Tennessee Williams, Faye Marsay is at the Donmar. Did she meet many of the TV juggernaut\u2019s huge cast? \u201cWhen I came in, in season four, our storyline had a wedding which meant everybody was there. It was really lovely.\u201d What did her audition require? \u201cI just had to, like, prowl around a little bit.\u201d An actor friend had randomly emailed to ask why she wasn\u2019t in the show. Varma thought: \u201cYeah, why am I not?\u201d She emailed another friend who worked on it and got the audition. Why is it so popular? She talks about clever storytelling, power struggles, then admits: \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t watched the whole thing to be honest.\u201d But she praises the Shakespearean richness in how characters contradict themselves. Varma\u2019s real Shakespeares include a Titus Andronicus at the Globe that supposedly had audiences fainting. \u201cOften they didn\u2019t pass out in the gory bits,\u201d she says. \u201cThe language is sort of more shocking.\u201d She remembers doing Twelfth Night and the power of Andrew Aguecheek\u2019s \u201cI was adored once too\u201d line. \u201cThey call it a heart-stopping line. At both the matinee and the evening, a person had a heart attack in that scene. Somebody who\u2019s a bit of a fool, who says stupid things, suddenly has one line that is profound. I did The Vertical Hour with David Hare. He said if you want to say something important, make a joke beforehand. I think Coward does that.\u201d Present Laughter\u2019s title comes from Twelfth Night. Coward\u2019s play was first called Sweet Sorrow but that was considered too gloomy for a wartime audience. \u201cI think Matthew is trying to go for the Sweet Sorrow version,\u201d says Varma before breaking out in a smile: \u201cBut there\u2019s definitely laughter!\u201d Present Laughter is at the Old Vic, London, until 10 August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
