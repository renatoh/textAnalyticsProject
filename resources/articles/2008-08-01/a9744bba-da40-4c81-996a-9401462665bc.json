Fiszman dismissed suggestions that Wenger has settled for artistic merit over mounting a serious challenge to Manchester United and Chelsea and he insisted Arsenal were in rude financial health even before effectively balancing the books on their summer signings, with their only notable buys so far being Samir Nasri and Mika\u00ebl Silvestre. He said it would be \"no problem\" to finance a \u00a330m signing. \"If he said to us 'I want this guy and he's \u00a330m, can I buy him?' the answer is yes. Absolutely yes,\" the director said. \"We totally back him. It's his decision.\" Wenger is looking to buy another midfielder and Fiszman strongly rejected the idea that the manager prefers style to substance. \"Absolutely not. We want to win and win badly but Ars\u00e8ne believes in creating teams the way he does. There's a dual problem for him. If we were to buy names, you are talking about relatively mature players who need to be integrated into the way Ars\u00e8ne plays. They don't know our style and it also impacts on the youngsters who've been brought through.\" Fiszman dismissed talk of a crisis after last weekend's defeat at Fulham, but accepted Arsenal need to capture their first trophy since 2005. \"I think it is time we won something again but only one club can win the Champions League and one can win the Premiership. We were close as you possibly can be last year ... We are optimistic this year.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
