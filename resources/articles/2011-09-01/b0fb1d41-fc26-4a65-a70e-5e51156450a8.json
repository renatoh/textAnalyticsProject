Over the past year they have been labelled \"morons\", \"sick-pots\" and \"dissidents\"while Leeds council's joy at China choosing the city as a base for the 2012 Olympics was greeted with \"all Leeds gets is increased sales of sweet and sour pork\". But forthe victory over Crystal Palace on Saturday, Bates failed to mint anything fresh. His critics, he wrote, are \"inarticulate short-sighted morons whose actions could wreck the club\". Fans who bemoan his parsimony in the transfer market will note the club have not even splashed out on a thesaurus Torres can't find his feet in country for old men Fernando Torres has put his poor start at Chelsea down to the age of the players: \"Chelsea has an older player, who plays very slow,\" he is reported to have said, shifting responsibility away from the man in his mirror. All very well, except the old lags with the old legs did fine for Nicolas Anelka and Daniel Sturridge at Sunderland No jacket required for bewildered Bruce Steve Bruce bid farewell to Asamoah Gyan with a swipe at \"the parasites\" who surround the striker. But what of the diamante-studded shellsuit top embossed with a map of Africa Gyan gave to Bruce as a present over the summer? One Wearside charity shop is bound to be getting a very singular and sparkly donation any day now Goal of the weekend Rub\u00e9n Rochina for Blackburn Rovers v Fulham, Craven Cottage We can't give it to Sergio Ag\u00fcero every week and the Blackburn striker's sumptuous left-foot strike that whipped past Fulham's Mark Schwarzer before hitting the bottom of the crossbar and bouncing in was the finest solo goal Statistics of the weekend 7 Manchester United hat-tricks scored by Wayne Rooney, tied for fourth on the list with Sir Bobby Charlton, behind Dennis Viollet and Jack Rowley. Denis Law with 18, though, looks unassailable 10 Record number of Premier League penalties conceded by Bradford City in 1999-2000 and Blackburn in 2006-07. Norwich City have given away four in four games so far this season 800,000 Pounds spent by Crawley Town on player transfer fees since the summer of 2010 compared with Morecambe who have spent zero. Morecambe defeated Crawley 6-0 on Saturday Meanwhile \u2026 in Erinsborough Wondering why Harry Kewell chose to move home to Australia and sign for Melbourne Victory over offers in Europe? Wonder no more. It seems there may also have been a lure for Mrs Kewell, Sheree Murphy, who has been lined up for a role in Neighbours by the show's producers. \"Our UK audience is massive, so to have somebody like Sheree would be great as she would be instantly recognisable to viewers over there,\" said a spokesman for the show. It comes as a terrible shock \u2026 to find Neighbours is still going."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
