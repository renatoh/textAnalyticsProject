But he seemed not to notice. Serena Williams seemed not to mind. Although it is not long since she emancipated herself from her big sister, she has other burdens to unload. Like getting rid of the memories of Roland Garros. Yesterday's was the younger Williams' first match since the torment of a lost title, the torture of a cruel crowd, and all the tears. This was a little bit of therapy with a lot of new possibilities. And it had gone well. There was a 6-3, 6-3 win over Jill Craybas, a touch on the shoulder, and a smile for a fellow American, not to mention the steady reconstruction of her serve, and unstinting applause from a very different crowd. This one marvelled at the muscular champion's dominant performance, ogled her accessories - the swinging orange belt and the giant circular earrings - and wondered how the woman who served so solidly could have had her delivery so rudely treated such a short time ago. She had gone away with father Richard and worked on it. Now he was on hand to witness his handiwork, smoking and chewing on a cheroot before the match, head slightly tilted during it, the calculated loopy look replaced by a glaze of studied introspection. When Serena hurtled down the first of her six aces, there was just a glance in his direction, though for a while she wasn't quite herself. \"I was a bit more nervous today - I don't know why,\" she said. To others the reason had seemed obvious. Then there was also the Lleyton Hewitt effect. \"I didn't want to take my opponent for granted. I'm sure he didn't take his for granted,\" she corrected herself hastily. \"But I wanted to make sure I was on my toes. I didn't want to make history by having two No1 defending champions go out.\" At the end, instead of needing to escape from a crowd, she was able to go to it. Signing autographs and touching hands brought smiles, though these moments had their darker side. Trailing her closely, and carrying her bag, was her personal bodyguard. It was here last year that a stalker was captured by police after crashing a getaway bicycle. Had she sensed she had gained more fans for the way she handled the Paris situation than she had for winning four grand slams? Had it humanised her? She basked in the sentiments of those questions and showed a light touch in dealing with the next one. \"You said you felt a little embarrassed that you had cried?\" \"My eyes were watering,\" she interrupted. \"Correction.\" After the laughter she was serious: \"They realised that even though I win a lot, and I do a lot of things, it's like I'm human. I'm just a young lady trying to make her way in life.\" Just that. There was, of course, the matter of a few million dollars, a few million sycophants, and a Wimbledon defence with a new meaning to it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
