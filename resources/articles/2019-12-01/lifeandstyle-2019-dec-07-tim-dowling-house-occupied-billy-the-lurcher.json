Even the cat\u2019s food bowl isn\u2019t safe", "bodyText": "It is Sunday evening, and my wife and I are returning from a weekend away. On the walk from the station we stop to buy two toothbrushes, because we left ours behind, and a bottle of wine, because. \u201cIt\u2019s so cold,\u201d my wife says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so tired.\u201d \u201cNearly there,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019ll order a takeaway, and then I\u2019m going to bed,\u201d she says. \u201cFine,\u201d I say. When I open the front door, a small grey head pokes out of it at about knee level. Two black, mournful eyes look up at me as if to say: well, this is awkward. \u201cHello, Billy,\u201d I say. Billy is a highly self-conscious lurcher who lives in a permanent state of social mortification. He\u2019s not our dog \u2013 he belongs to the youngest one\u2019s friend \u2013 but we see a lot of him. This is not the first time he\u2019s greeted us at the door looking shamefaced. It becomes clear that Billy is not alone. From inside the house there wafts the smell of cigarette smoke and the unmistakable sound of Fifa 19 being played in manager mode. Someone is laughing. Someone else is cooking. Somewhere behind the door, our actual dog is barking. \u201cCan we come in, Billy?\u201d my wife says. As I push the door wider, Billy takes three steps backwards, all the while fixing me with a look that seems to say: forgive me. In the sitting room, the oldest one and his friend are using a joystick apiece to revitalise the computer-generated lineup of Sligo Town. The middle one is sitting beside them, monitoring another match on his laptop while also looking at his phone. I shed my coat where I stand. \u201cWhat an unexpected pleasure,\u201d my wife says, dropping her bag. \u201cI know, right?\u201d says the oldest one\u2019s friend. In the kitchen, the youngest one and Billy\u2019s owner are making chilli, apparently for everyone. \u201cHey,\u201d the youngest one says. \u201cHey,\u201d his friend says. \u201cA full house, then,\u201d my wife says, collapsing on to the sofa. \u201cIncluding Billy,\u201d I say. Everyone turns to look at Billy, who is at that moment poised to help himself from the cat\u2019s food bowl. At the sound of his name, he turns his head and flashes me a look that says: I promised myself I would stop doing this, oh God, I\u2019m loathsome. The middle one and his friend fill two bowls and retreat upstairs. I pour myself a glass of wine and go in search of a place to sit. I end up watching Fifa 19 being played in manager mode for several bewildering minutes. \u201cNo!\u201d shouts the oldest one as the opposition score. \u201cHe\u2019s picked his pocket there, in the dying seconds of the first half,\u201d his friend says. I point to the screen. \u201cCan you turn that back into a television?\u201d I say. \u201cYeah,\u201d the oldest one says. \u201cAfter this.\u201d I stand up and return to the kitchen. Billy follows by my side, like a small, embarrassed pony. My wife is at the table, reading a magazine that arrived while we were away. \u201cWhat are you doing back here?\u201d she says. \u201cI came to hang out with you,\u201d I say. \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m having some quiet time.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019ve got nowhere to be,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd neither does Billy.\u201d At the sound of his name, Billy gives me a rueful look and leaves the room. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d my wife says. \u201cI need space, and you\u2019re ruining it.\u201d I sigh, refill my glass and return to the sitting room, where I find Billy lying on the floor, on top of my coat. He lifts his head and fixes me with a pained gaze that seems to say: this is not what it looks like. \u201cOh, Billy,\u201d I say, retaking my seat. Finally, the match ends. The oldest one returns the TV to TV mode, and lobs the remote at me. I point it at the screen and press. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d the oldest says. \u201cEscape To The Chateau,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to defend my devotion to it at this point.\u201d \u201cFair enough,\u201d the oldest one\u2019s friend says. Billy returns his head to my coat and stares at the ceiling with a look of boundless regret."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
