In July Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude met with 19 leading companies to discuss the need for new efficiency savings. Cable &amp; Wireless said it has identified ways in which its current contract base could provide savings for the government. The company said that the MoU has opened up the opportunity for \"increased engagement and collaboration\" with various government departments that are looking to drive down costs and improve efficiencies. Brian Woodford, managing director of public sector and partners at Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide, said: \"We are encouraged by comments from the Cabinet Office that they want increased choice and competition in the procurement process. The MoU represents an important milestone as we meet the government's immediate efficiency agenda and commit to support its reform initiatives.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
