Summer schools for teachers from different subjects should be set up where they can learn the craft of writing and take their new skills back to the classroom, it is being suggested. The 10-day summer schools would be held during the holiday and be the core part of a national writing project that would be adopted across the UK, researcher Richard Andrews, professor in English at the Institute of Education in London, proposes. He says: \"We need to deepen our competency of writing as teachers in order to help kids become better writers themselves.\" Andrews wants the UK to develop its own version of the national writing project used by teachers in schools in the US, which was first introduced in 1974. Under the US model, teachers are trained in six key areas of writing \u2014 content; structure and genre; stance; fluency (which includes structure and grammar); diction (including vocabulary) and accuracy in spelling and punctuation. The latest evaluation of the US initiative published earlier this year showed \"improvement\" or \"significant improvement\" in all six areas from children who were taught by teachers who had been through the project's professional training and development compared to children who were taught by teachers who had not. The findings are especially important because they compared the results of children from four different geographical areas and included children from different socio-economic backgrounds. Says Andrews: \"These are extraordinary results.\" Poor performance The idea to adopt a national writing project in the UK comes as statistics continue to show a gap in performance between children's achievement in reading and their achievement in writing, particularly at the age of 11. According to this year's key stage 2 results, the number of 11-year-olds reaching level 4 in writing was 67% compared to 88% in reading. But Andrews says: \"This isn't about schools failing to meet English standards, because in reading we have done very well. But children lag behind in writing, especially at the age of 11. That is why I want to contribute to the national effort.\" While he believes teachers' lack of writing skill has contributed to the gap, there are other influencing factors. \"Writing is a complex business, which is why it's difficult for kids. It's not just about the surface features such as spelling or grammar, it's about learning to express yourself in a whole range of genres.\" He says writing and speaking are also much more difficult than reading and listening because they are \"active skills\": \"With writing you have to produce and create.\" But there are other issues that may play a part in children's underachievement in writing. Andrews says: \"It may be that there isn't enough time being spent on extended writing or speaking. If you are filling in worksheets or filling in small texts, you aren't getting the practice in lengthy composition.\" Surprisingly, perhaps, Andrews does not blame the text messaging and email culture. \"Texting is a compressed language and you have got to be able to know what you are writing when you use compressing. There is value to texting \u2014 we shouldn't worry about that.\" Andrews's research report, The Case for a National Writing Project, which was funded by the not-for-profit organisation the CfBT Education Trust, calls for a three-year pilot scheme to be set up in the UK. Costing at least \u00a3260,000, the idea would be to establish either a large-scale pathfinder pilot or develop a smaller pilot that would involve four pairs of schools \u2014 one primary and one secondary \u2014 in both rural and urban locations. Whichever pilot model was adopted, teachers would be expected to attend a creative writing school during their summer holiday and would be trained in the same six key writing skills used in the US scheme. The teachers would then feed back what they have learned into their schools' professional development programme. Two annual conferences would also be held. Ideally, Andrews says the teachers would come from a range of subject disciplines, including the sciences, if the scheme is to benefit the whole school community. He says: \"They don't have to be English teachers. If you offered the invitation to teachers from other disciplines as well and got people who have history or science interested, you could take them along; they may in fact be better than English teachers. When I was at the University of York, I worked with science teachers who were very interested in the arguments and language of science.\" According to Andrews, it may be misguided to assume that teachers of English are best placed to teach writing. He says: \"The burden has in the past fallen on literacy or English teachers. While these teachers often have a degree in English, they have only been asked to write in a limited range of forms. When they do their PGCE, they really narrow their writing competencies down to a range of writing styles. English teachers are brilliant at advanced reading, but an English literature degree is not a degree in advanced writing.\" Professional practice While English teachers may balk at the suggestion that they may be poor teachers of writing, it is a view shared by the National Association of Writers in Education, a membership organisation made up of professional writers and teachers to improve links between the two professions and schools. Its director, poet Paul Munden, says: \"If you look at other creative arts, you have music or arts teachers in schools who are [practising] artists or musicians. English teachers don't see themselves as creative writers.\" Munden believes one of the reasons behind the lack of children's creative writing skill has been the narrow focus of the government's literacy programme. He says: \"It focused so much on the basics, for very good reason, but it's meant that the more creative things have got squeezed out, although that is starting to swing back to some extent, I think.\" While he welcomes the idea of a national writing project in the UK, he says there will always be a place for bringing professional writers into the classroom. \"It's always useful to have a real role model coming in and talking to children, building on what the teacher can deliver,\" Munden says. He agrees with Andrews that a national writing project could boost the professional development of teachers and their creative writing talents. He also believes it is crucial that creative writing becomes a core part of initial teacher training. \"Until that happens, we will always be struggling to catch up.\" Andrews's proposals may have the support of professional writers as well as \"senior advisers to ministers\", but they may struggle to win the backing of teacher unions. Chris Keates, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers (Nasuwt), says teachers are naturally reflective practitioners and open to new ideas and ways of working, but she says: \"Teachers are very sceptical about so-called magic bullets to solve a problem. Even if the results from the US are encouraging, teachers will want to look at this research and evaluate it, and if I was a teacher with an English degree the question I would be asking is, 'How could I get my degree if I couldn't write?'\" \u00b7 Have your say: post your comments at EducationGuardian.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
