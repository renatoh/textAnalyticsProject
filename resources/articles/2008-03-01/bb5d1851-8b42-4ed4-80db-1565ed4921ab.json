As his relegation-threatened team-mates expressed relief at securing a point at Birmingham on Tuesday, Given was waiting to be operated on by Ulrike Muschaweck, a leading specialist who has previously operated on Alan Shearer, Michael Owen and Steve Harper. Given has been troubled by groin problems since undergoing emergency surgery after perforating his bowel in an accidental collision at West Ham last season, and Harper has been deputising in recent weeks. \"It was nice to travel home from Birmingham without that sickening feeling of losing another game,\" the stand-in goalkeeper said. \"We are disappointed not to have won, but it was a big point although it will mean nothing if we don't win against Fulham [on Saturday].\" Kevin Keegan would relish recording the first win of his second stint at Newcastle and against a club he has managed, and Owen acknowledges that victory would assuage the squad's anxieties. \"We aim to finish the season with everyone saying, 'What were we worried about?'\" said the captain and scorer of the equaliser at St Andrew's. \"We need to win but we have something to build on and are optimistic. Ours was a decent performance, and it keeps Birmingham below us.\" Owen was partnered by Mark Viduka and Obafemi Martins, the latter turning a little petulant when he was substituted in the second half. Yesterday, though, the Nigerian claimed all is well. \"There are no problems. All I'm trying to do is help the club get away from the relegation zone. The new coach [Keegan] plays attacking tactics and that suits my game a lot. I am satisfied with that and the way we are going forward and wanting to pass now.\" Middlesbrough, meanwhile, will not be appealing against the red card issued to Mido during Saturday's 1-1 draw at Arsenal, where he was sent off after his boot made contact with Ga\u00ebl Clichy's head as the pair challenged for possession. After consultations with Mark Halsey, the match referee, and Keith Hackett, the head of refereeing, Gareth Southgate opted not to pursue the matter. \"Whether or not there is intent is no longer considered relevant,\" the manager said. \"It's about whether a challenge is putting an opponent in danger. But a three-game ban is very harsh - we're not happy about it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
