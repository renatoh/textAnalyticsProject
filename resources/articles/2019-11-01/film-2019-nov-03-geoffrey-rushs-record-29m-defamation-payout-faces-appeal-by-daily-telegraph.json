Set down for two days, the appeal was brought by the Telegraph through its parent company, Nationwide News, after a judge ruled the paper had defamed Rush by alleging he \u201cengaged in inappropriate behaviour\u201d during a theatre production of King Lear in 2015. The Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid announced in May that it would appeal the verdict, citing 16 grounds on which it claims the trial was miscarried and that federal court justice Michael Wigney\u2019s conduct in the case \u201cgave rise to an apprehension of bias\u201d. If the appeal fails, Rush is due to receive $2.9m in damages based on past and future lost earnings. It is the largest ever defamation payout to a single person in Australia after the Victorian court of appeal last year slashed the actor Rebel Wilson\u2019s damages payout from $4.5m to $600,000 over defamatory articles in Woman\u2019s Day magazine. Published under the headline \u201cKing Leer\u201d in November 2017, the Daily Telegraph reported the Sydney Theatre Company had received the anonymous complaint but provided no further details. Follow-up articles were published the next day, which Wigney said \u201cdoubled down\u201d on the story. Rush sued the newspaper and the journalist Jonathon Moran, claiming the articles conveyed the imputation that Rush was a \u201cpervert\u201d, a \u201csexual predator\u201d and \u201ccommitted sexual assault\u201d. Heard over two weeks in November last year, much of the trial centred on the evidence of Rush\u2019s co-star Eryn Jean Norvill, who made the initial complaint about the actor to the Sydney Theatre Company. Despite being at the centre of the Telegraph\u2019s articles, before the trial Norvill said she had never previously spoken publicly about Rush\u2019s alleged behaviour towards her. After she complained to the theatre company, Norvill said she did not want to take the issue further, and did not want Rush to be informed of her complaint. She was not named in the Telegraph\u2019s stories and did not cooperate in their publication. Over two days, Norvill told the court that Rush \u2013 one of Australia\u2019s best-known actors \u2013 engaged \u201cdaily\u201d in a pattern of \u201csexual harassment\u201d including \u201csexual innuendo\u201d and groping gestures that made her feel \u201cbelittled\u201d, \u201cfrightened\u201d and \u201ctrapped\u201d. The trial also included a rollcall of prominent members of Australia\u2019s film, television and theatre community giving testimony on behalf of Rush. The Oscar nominee Judy Davis and US agent Fred Specktor both took the stand to give evidence for the actor, while the director of the King Lear production, Neil Armfield, and two actors, Robyn Nevin and Helen Buday, told the court they did not witness any inappropriate behaviour from Rush during the production. In his judgment, Wigney found in favour of Rush and said the reports in the Daily Telegraph were \u201cin all the circumstances, a recklessly irresponsible piece of sensationalist journalism of the worst kind\u201d. The judge said that while he was \u201cacutely conscious of and had regard to the difficulties and disadvantages that are often encountered by complainants in cases involving allegations of sexual harassment\u201d, he ultimately rejected Norvill\u2019s evidence and instead accepted the version of Rush\u2019s witnesses. He said Norvill\u2019s evidence was \u201cnot only uncorroborated but contradicted by ... the evidence of Rush, [director Neil] Armfield, [and cast members Robyn] Nevin and [Helen] Buday.\u201d During the verdict, Norvill closed her eyes as the judge said she was a witness \u201cprone to exaggeration and embellishment\u201d. In the closing stages of the trial, lawyers for Nationwide News had attempted to introduce evidence from someone who became known as \u201cwitness x\u201d alleging separate acts of a \u201csexual nature\u201d against Rush. However, the evidence was refused, and it wasn\u2019t until May when a suppression order was lifted that it was revealed \u201cwitness x\u201d was the Hollywood actress Yael Stone, star of the Netflix series Orange is the New Black. In an interview with the New York Times in December, Stone alleged that, during a 2010 Belvoir St theatre production of The Diary of a Madman, Rush held a mirror above her while she showered, danced naked in front of her and touched her back in an \u201cunwanted\u201d and \u201cvery sensual manner\u201d. Rush denied the allegation, saying in a statement issued through his lawyers at the time that the allegations were \u201cincorrect and in some instances have been taken completely out of context\u201d. \u201cHowever, clearly Yael has been upset on occasion by the spirited enthusiasm I generally bring to my work,\u201d he said. \u201cI sincerely and deeply regret if I have caused her any distress. This, most certainly, has never been my intention. \u201cWhen we performed in The Diary of a Madman eight years ago, I believe we engaged in a journey as artistic comrades. Over the years we have shared correspondence that always contained a mutual respect and admiration. \u201cAs I have said in the past, I abhor any behaviour that might be considered as harassment or intimidation to anyone \u2013 whether in the workplace or any other environment.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
