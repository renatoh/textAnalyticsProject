The 2.5 metre (8.2ft) saltwater crocodile clamped its jaws around Chantal Burnup's torso soon after she entered the water at Doubtful Bay, 1,491 miles north of Perth in Western Australia. Chantal's father wrestled her from the crocodile's jaws while her brother, Simon, 14, beat it away. \"Simon was so brave. I know how lucky I am,\" said Chantal, who suffered bruising, cuts and puncture wounds in the attack."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
