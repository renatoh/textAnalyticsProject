Charities are warning that up to 111,000 lone parents \u2013 nine out of 10 of whom are women \u2013 are being \"set up to fail\" because of the lack of jobs available to them or childcare help to go back to work. The changes, designed by the previous government, mean that all single parents with a youngest child aged seven to nine will be switched from income support to jobseeker's allowance (JSA). Parents with a youngest child aged 12 were moved to the new system in 2008 and those with a youngest aged 10 were moved over in 2009. The coalition has said that the age threshold will reduce again in a year's time to five \u2013 when the youngest child reaches school age. The move will add to pressure on families, who have been identified as among the biggest losers in last week's spending review. In the days since George Osborne, the chancellor, unveiled the government's spending plans, research has consistently identified women and families as the biggest losers. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that families would suffer the greatest losses under the welfare reform plans, while an analysis by the Trades Union Congress found that single parent families would lose most from cuts to departmental budgets. Overall, women stand to lose more than twice as much as men. Research by the House of Commons library found that of the \u00a38.5bn being raised by cutting welfare alone, \u00a35.7bn \u2013 two-thirds \u2013 is coming from women, while \u00a32.7bn is being raised from men. Fiona Weir, chief executive of Gingerbread, a charity that supports lone parent families, said: \"The coalition government says it wants to make work pay and to support single parents into work, but the reality is that today thousands of single parents are being set up to fail. Government needs to act fast to improve availability of jobs with flexible working hours, improve the job-search support provided from day one of a claim, and increase access to childcare. \"Gingerbread welcomes the aim of new welfare reform proposals to make work pay, but the timescale for their implementation is too long for the single parents affected by today's change. We urge the government to introduce short-term measures to help make short-hours jobs pay, and to review recent decisions to cut help with childcare costs which will create a further barrier for single parents trying to get into work.\" Switching from income support to JSA does not incur immediate financial penalties, but people receiving JSA are expected to be actively looking for work, attending jobcentre interviews and be willing to take employment that fits within their child's school day. If they refuse work, they can lose up to 40% of their payments. The extension of the plans until the youngest child in a family reaches the age of five was announced at the budget, when the government estimated that a further 100,000 single parents would be affected in 2011, saving \u00a3380m between then and 2015. Weir highlighted the downturn in public sector employment as a particular barrier for single parents finding jobs. Women make up 65% of public sector workers and 75% of local government employees, and are expected to bear the brunt of the estimated 490,000 job cuts. Many of them work part-time in order to fit their jobs around their family lives. 'There just aren't the jobs' Michael Ireland, 37, a lone parent of three, has been unemployed since he wound up his freelance photography business in June. Two weeks ago, he received a letter saying his fortnightly \u00a3120 in income support was to stop from November, and that he was to get jobseeker's allowance instead \u2013 a change he supports, in theory. \"I think the government is right to encourage people to get jobs, but the problem is they haven't put in the support to help people like me get back into work,\" he said. \"There just aren't the jobs out there at the moment, and it is only going to get worse after the cuts announced last week.\" His children \u2013 two boys, 16 and 14, and a girl, 9 \u2013 attend different schools, and he has to drop off and pick up the two youngest every day. \"When I look at job adverts, the first thing I look at is not the pay, but the hours,\" he said. \"Realistically, I can't start until 9.30 and I need to leave by 2.30 at the latest. I've looked at getting my daughter into a kids' club at her school, but it's jammed full. A place there costs \u00a31.50 per half hour, but I'd take it if we could get one so that I could work.\" He has applied for all sort of jobs, \"from sandwich filler to regional sales director\". He was rejected for the first, he said, because the firm decided he had \"too many other commitments\". But he would have taken it, he insisted: \"I want to work.\" To improve his job prospects, Ireland is due start a nine-month NVQ in childcare in November, but is unsure whether he will be allowed to once on jobseeker's allowance, let alone follow it with a degree.
