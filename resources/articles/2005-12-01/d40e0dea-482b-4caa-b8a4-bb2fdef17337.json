A second utility, Bristol Water Group, reported a 44% increase in interim profits to \u00a310.5m as it also benefited from an increase in its prices. Pennon justified the payments to shareholders as a one-off gain resulting from a decision to reduce its financing costs through taking on more debt and retiring some of its equity. As part of the move, South West Water, which provides regulated water and sewerage services to 1.6m people in Devon and Cornwall, is giving customers a one-off \u00a320 per household payment. But the south west branch of the consumer council for water was sceptical about how much customers were benefiting. Its chairman, Charles Howeson, said consumers in the south west \"frankly can see no light at the end of the tunnel in terms of relatively steep increases.\" Bills in the south west are expected to rise by a further 25% in real terms over the five years from April, bringing the average bill up to \u00a3450 a year by 2009, according to analysts. Some customers are paying nearly \u00a3700 already and Pennon yesterday announced a better-than-expected 22% rise in first half profits before tax and exceptional items of \u00a360.8m. The company said it wanted customers to share in its financial success and so would send them a \u00a320 cheque before the end of March. \"This is a one-off opportunity arising from the financial restructuring and the board thinks it's appropriate to share the efficiency that generates under the circumstances,\" said South West Water's chief executive Bob Baty. Pennon finance director David Dupont described the payment to customers as \"meaningful\" and said local people were aware that the relatively high level of bills resulted from an expensive push to clean up beaches. Pennon plans to hand back money to investors via a share buyback as well as a 20% rise to 16.5p in its first half dividend. This, plus a commitment to a 3% per annum rise in the real dividend until 2009/10, sent its shares to a record \u00a312.08, double their value of two years ago. South West Water accounted for a 15.4% rise in operating profits to \u00a377.8m with its Viridor waste management business providing a further \u00a316.8m with a 15.1% increase. The latter business was boosted by higher user fees."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
