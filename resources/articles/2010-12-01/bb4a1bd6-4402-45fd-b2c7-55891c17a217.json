A sweet lies on the floor, tempting even though it is covered with hair. A child walks home in the dark, frightened that every shadow is a monster. It's fair to say that Playing Out is more downbeat than the average children's album; add in the musical sophistication of tracks like Illegal, a sultry blend of doo-wop and funk, and you might suspect it's not made for children at all. But that would be unfair to the Crayonettes \u2013 folk singer Kathryn Williams and her punky pal Anna Spencer \u2013 and their ability to reflect the surreal meanderings of a child's imagination in the way that, say, Lewis Carroll did. Their songs are witty, silly and gently instructive, sufficiently simple for a child to love, but with enough depth that they don't drive parents mad. In other words, as children's music goes, Playing Out is the holy grail."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
