The editorial in Grapevine magazine, which is delivered free to 23,000 houses in Sheffield each month, recounted a conversation between the editor, Ian Macgill, and an \u201cold chum\u201d in which the latter said pavement cyclists needed to be \u201ctaught a lesson\u201d using wire at head height. In the article, Macgill said he objected to the idea on the grounds that cyclists may be decapitated \u201cand the pavements will become covered in red slime and gore, which will cause all sorts of health and safety hazards\u201d. He might slip and hurt himself leaving the Grapevine office, he said. Contacted by the Guardian, Macgill said it was just \u201ca piece of whimsy\u201d. \u201cTell people who complained that I\u2019m probably going to recommend landmines next time,\u201d he said. The remarks have gone down badly among the local cycling community. \u201cThis kind of comment \u2013 joking or otherwise \u2013 legitimises the anti-cyclist hatred and rhetoric that groups like Ride Sheffield, Peak District MTB and me \u2013 as well as others such as CycleSheffield have worked hard \u2013 successfully I might add \u2013 to combat,\u201d wrote Chris Maloney on his Keeper of the Peak blog. \u201cMore than that, as well as legitimising the bile, Macgill has gone one step further and suggested ways in which an easily led idiot could cause serious bodily harm. It\u2019s not surprising that there have been a number of people calling for the police to be involved,\u201d Maloney added. He claims acts of \u201ctrail sabotage\u201d \u2013 where routes are booby-trapped with wire or other objects \u2013 are a regular hazard for mountain bikers in Sheffield and beyond. \u201cIf Macgill were even remotely aware of the almost weekly examples of trail sabotage cyclists see he\u2019d have realised just how poor taste his ridiculous column is,\u201d wrote Maloney. \u201cPerhaps he could imagine his kids or grandkids being on the receiving end.\u201d Maloney printed a list of businesses advertising in Grapevine \u2013 which include the Foundry Climbing Centre and wedding venue Tapton Hall \u2013 \u201cshould you wish to make an educated decision on where you next spend your cash\u201d. People then contacted the businesses online to suggest they not advertise with Grapevine again. A number of cyclists across the UK have been hurt by wires in recent years. In Manchester in 2016 Adam Hoult was \u201cnearly decapitated\u201d after being caught by a booby trap tripwire on a popular route in Stretford. He was left with a crushed oesophagus and severe burns around his neck which he feared at the time could scar him for life. A survey of Australian drivers earlier this year suggested more than half think cyclists are not completely human, making it easier to justify hatred or aggression towards them. Macgill was unrepentant and suggested the advertising boycott would not work. He repeated a call from the magazine to make number plates mandatory on bikes \u201cso that we can photograph and report cyclists if they are cycling on the pavement\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
