This doesn't happen much, but the stars aligned earlier this month when Ann Coulter called John Edwards a \"faggot\" at a big conservative conference, and her usual defenders on the right decided she wasn't worth the struggle. Winced Michelle Malkin: \"We don't expect our children to be exposed to that garbage at the nation's pre-eminent conservative gathering.\" Cringed RedState.org: \"I hope every single conservative in America disowns her.\" Music to liberal ears. The speed with which everyone tossed Coulter overboard is surely an indication that something is going right in the world. (Yes, it's no longer OK to call a presidential candidate a faggot onstage at a major political conference. Ditto basketball players and actors.) But what about the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Peter Pace? Last week, while defending the army's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, Pace said he believes \"homosexual acts between individuals are immoral and that we should not condone immoral acts.\" He added that he does not think \"the armed forces of the United States are well served by saying through our policies that it's OK to be immoral in any way.\" Democrats and gay rights groups were quick to condemn. But Robert Gates and every leading GOP presidential candidate weren't. (Sam Brownback actually sent Pace a letter of support.) Does this state of affairs make sense? I doubt it. To review: Ann Coulter gets in trouble for calling a straight man a faggot for a couple of laughs. Peter Pace slathers opprobrium on actual gay people, in support of a policy that affects actual, real-life gay people, and gets a supportive nod from his boss. All he has to do is issue a clarification a few days later: \"I should have focused more on my support of the policy and less on my personal moral views.\" This is ludicrous. Pace's \"personal moral view\" is that homosexual acts are immoral. And he supports kicking gays out of the military precisely because it reduces the number of such acts. So it's a tiny bit difficult to imagine how Pace could have \"focused more\" on the policy, while leaving morality out of the picture. His personal morality is the whole reason he supports the policy, not some incidental feature, like an umbrella or an ugly tie, that he can just choose to leave at home. Of course, Pace can get away with this because he's a far less obnoxious figure than Coulter (not hard). But Pace's clarification also plays on the strangely bifurcated way in which Americans treat homosexuality. In pop culture, across the media and among political elites, saying a bad word about gays is no longer acceptable, and even whining about immorality is something that needs to be clarified. But the statute books - and, to some extent, opinion polls - are yet to catch up. (And if you live in any state other than Massachusetts, there are far more conspicuous examples of this than don't ask, don't tell.) In short, our public rhetoric has outpaced our public policy. It wouldn't be the first time. The southern senators who spent the 1950s blocking civil rights legislation rarely voiced their public opposition in crude racial terms. Instead, such laws were said to be anti-democratic, or ultimately bad for blacks. (Dick Russell, the longtime head of the Conservative Coalition, was eloquent enough to make an anti-civil rights agenda sound like Immanuel Kant.) You can find other examples today. It's not kosher for college students to host an illegal immigrant-themed party. But it's perfectly fine to pass laws that deprive them of most social benefits. And so forth. When it comes to gay rights, catching up is probably just a matter of time. (Does anyone doubt that gay marriage will be acceptable and legal in a generation?) But, in the meantime, why treat the fights as two different things? Winning rhetorical battles against the likes of Ann Coulter is easy. Winning substantive battles against the likes of Peter Pace and Bob Gates is hard. It would be a mistake to confuse the two: Equal respect can be a pretty convenient way of papering over a lack of equal rights. And it would be a mistake to pretend they're equally valuable. Sure, the rhetorical battles might count for something. Peter Pace will not be invited to many Georgetown dinner parties if he keeps going on about those crazy gays and their moral emptiness. And, of course, it's nice when everyone condemns Ann Coulter. It really is. But wouldn't it be so much nicer if they just let gays serve in the military?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
