The Lincolnshire arable farmer, who for decades has relied on \u201camazing\u201d workers from eastern Europe to plant the broccoli and cauliflower he grows for Tesco, was trying to come to terms with the EU referendum result, and it hurt. Questions of access to labour, the falling pound and what will happen to the EU subsidies that make his wheat crop viable were all on his mind. But as with so many remainers across the UK on Friday, it was his fears for future generations that triggered the tears. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me \u2013 I am 67,\u201d he said, his voice cracking. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realise what this means. But they will \u2026 Stability is a wonderful thing.\u201d Gesturing to his friends who voted out, Bradley added: \u201cWe can all afford a beer. This is a good life. Why upset the apple cart?\u201d His was a lone voice in a pub busy with some of the 75.6% Boston voters who sided with leave on Thursday. They were mostly middle-aged and retired men who complained about foreign workers crushing wages, clogging up the NHS and \u201cdegrading\u201d the town by drinking in the streets. \u201cThere\u2019s too many foreigners,\u201d said Lesley Gardner, 74, a retired lorry driver. \u201cI used to start at 5am and finish at 11am for \u00a3100. The foreigners will do the same for \u00a340. I believe leaving will increase the wages again.\u201d \u201cI am not concerned about them coming and working, but I am concerned about the social effects,\u201d said Peter Massam, 48, a petrol tanker driver. \u201cThey are not interested in integration, it\u2019s harder to get GP appointments, and I had a problem getting my child into primary school.\u201d There is no doubting the impact the free movement of people across the EU has had in Boston, where the streets resound with eastern European languages and rents have risen because landlords are able to pack more migrant workers into each home than UK citizens will accept. Of the towns and cities that voted most strongly for Brexit, Boston saw by far the greatest levels of net migration in the last recorded year, with 1,364 more foreigners arriving than leaving between June 2014 and June 2015. In 2011, 13% of Boston\u2019s 64,637 population was born abroad, and in January, the town was named the least integrated in England by the Policy Exchange thinktank. In the marketplace, migrants and English residents tried to make sense of the Brexit vote. Nigella Glasukaite, 55, a Lithuanian auxiliary nurse at the town\u2019s Pilgrim hospital said she was \u201cafraid the European Union was collapsing\u201d. \u201cI am sad,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have worked so hard to be together, with free movement to give people a better future, and now everything is changing.\u201d She talked with Nick, 50, a local plumber, about the need for more integration between different cultures. \u201cI have lived here all my life and it\u2019s happened too fast,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has not been enough integration and that feels alienating.\u201d For Nick and the large majority in Boston, the time to keep trying is now over. But while many of the Brexiters sank a celebratory lunchtime pint, there was a reminder of how the British economy relies on EU labour. Outside the health clinic, several dozen young eastern Europeans, many here just for the summer, waited to board shuttle buses to their 10-hour shifts bagging salad for Asda and Aldi. Around the corner, on West Street, lined with eastern European grocers, Illona, 33, a Lithuanian who runs the Baltic Food Store, agreed that there were problems with immigration. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to stop migration because it has become too much,\u201d she said. \u201cEnglish people are angry because they think we don\u2019t want to speak English. Some of us don\u2019t want to integrate. But in 13 years of being here, I have never had a problem with a neighbour. We are friendly, we have made a life here, and I don\u2019t think about going back to Lithuania. I don\u2019t need benefits; I work a lot and pay taxes and I don\u2019t see why we should leave.\u201d Daniel Kiszewski, 19, who runs the neighbouring Polish mini-mart, said he couldn\u2019t understand the referendum decision. Kiszewski, who came to the UK from Poland at the age of three, said he had rarely felt any tension between communities. \u201cLook at Germany,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are experiencing 10 times worse [immigration] than us, but I don\u2019t see them getting crazy about it.\u201d Michael Brooks, the deputy leader of Boston borough council, said he was pleased with the vote, and said the European Union should have helped with the impact on services and housing. \u201cThe issues were raised time and time again locally,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople got very, very frustrated.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
