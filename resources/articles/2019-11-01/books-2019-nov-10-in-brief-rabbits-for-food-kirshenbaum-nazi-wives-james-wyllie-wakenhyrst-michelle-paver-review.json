She is in hospital following a New Year\u2019s Eve breakdown after months of depression. As the novel spools back in time, we follow Bunny\u2019s journey from accomplished writer to psychiatric patient, by way of her best friend\u2019s death and flashbacks to her childhood. In the hospital, Bunny clashes with the doctors, makes wicked observations on her fellow patients and writes hilariously about the hospital\u2019s creative writing class. Razor-sharp, astutely observed and acerbically funny. Nazi Wives: The Women at the Top of Hitler\u2019s Germany James Wyllie The History Press, \u00a320, pp288 \u201cAmong the thousands of books about Nazism,\u201d writes Wyllie, \u201cbarely a handful focus on the wives of the leading figures in Hitler\u2019s regime.\u201d Redressing that imbalance, Wyllie tells the stories of the wives of Goering, Goebbels, Himmler and others, charting the trajectory of each from first becoming involved in the movement through the war and beyond, into \u201cthe postwar twilight of denial and delusion\u201d. Highlighting similarities in the women\u2019s backgrounds, Wyllie provides a distinctive prism through which to view the period. Wakenhyrst Michelle Paver Head of Zeus, \u00a38.99, pp368 (paperback) It\u2019s 1966 and 69-year-old Maud lives as a recluse in a semi-derelict Suffolk manor house, which she has inhabited since her father bludgeoned someone to death with a pickaxe more than 50 years ago. Having lived out the rest of his days in an asylum, her father has recently died, leaving behind a triptych of paintings that may have contributed to his madness. The narrative returns to Maud\u2019s troubled childhood with her tyrannical father, whose misogynism and sexual exploitation we learn about through Maud\u2019s reading of his diary. Treading a fine line between the supernatural and psychological torment, Paver\u2019s tale is atmospheric and intriguing. \u2022 To order Rabbits for Food, Nazi Wives or Wakenhyrst, go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837.
