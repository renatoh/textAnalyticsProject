The German-language manuscript, titled Quantum theory of the monatomic ideal gas, was published in 1925. The paper predicted that at temperatures near absolute zero particles in a gas can reach a state of such low energy that they clump together. In 2001, University of Colorado at Boulder scientists Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman were awarded the Nobel prize for their work based on Einstein's theory. Bridge collapse Thirty-one people were injured when a temporary bridge erected at a pop music festival in Salzburg, Austria, gave way. Concert goers were sent tumbling when the two-metre high wooden and steel bridge, which spanned a small stream, buckled late on Friday. Authorities said the injured suffered broken bones, cuts and bruises. Indian border fight Indian and Bangladeshi border guards were firing at each other again yesterday, a day after a dispute over a construction along the frontier flared into a gunfight. Early on Friday, Indian troops fired on hundreds of Bangladeshi workers and soldiers to stop the construction of a river embankment close to the zero line, triggering a gun battle that lasted almost the whole day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
