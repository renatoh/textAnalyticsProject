Critics of the approach have warned that prorogation would involve the Queen in a constitutional crisis, because formally it is the monarch who ends a session of parliament. Raab said it was unlikely to come to that because MPs\u2019 powers to block a no-deal Brexit were limited. He said that if chosen as Tory leader he would return to Brussels with a \u201cbest, final offer\u201d - including the removal of the Irish backstop \u2013 but insist there could be no further delay, and that the UK would be prepared to leave without a deal. \u201cI think anyone who is talking about delay or who is taking [World Trade Organization trade terms] off the table is having the perverse effect of weakening our negotiating position in Brussels. That\u2019s the lesson of the last three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a test of nerve here and if candidates cannot stand up their resolve to lead us out by the end of October in a leadership contest, what chance would they have under the heat of the negotiations in Brussels?\u201d Raab said the Peterborough byelection, in which the Tories finished third, and the party\u2019s drubbing in the European election, showed it was \u201cdevastating for the Conservatives if we don\u2019t keep our promises on Brexit\u201d. He said: \u201cWhat we can\u2019t have is this paralysing uncertainty, bad for the economy, bad for trust in democracy, bad for the Conservatives \u2013 as we are seeing \u2013 of just going on and on with this prolonged torture of haggling with the EU when we haven\u2019t got a deal in sight.\u201d The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, said on Thursday that it was \u201cblindingly obvious\u201d the new Conservative prime minister would not be able to suspend parliament to push through a no-deal Brexit. \u201cThat is simply not going to happen. It is just so blindingly obvious that it almost doesn\u2019t need to be stated, but apparently, it does and therefore I have done,\u201d he told MPs. Following Theresa May\u2019s formal resignation as Tory leader on Friday, the starting gun has been fired in the race to succeed her. The nomination process will take place on Monday, with candidates requiring eight MPs to back them in order to enter the race, with the first round of voting on Thursday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
