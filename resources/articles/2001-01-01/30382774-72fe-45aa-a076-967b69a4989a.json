Souness recalled: \"I'd been offered the job and I couldn't believe what I saw in that match. But I was keen to take it.\" Nine months on from the result that epitomised a traumatic season, Blackburn are third in the First Division with a game in hand on Bolton, who are second and three points ahead. They have lost only one of their past 15 league matches and currently look the best bet to claim second place in the one-horse race that Fulham have made of the Nationwide League. But Souness is not happy. His team, epitomised by the frustrating Matt Jansen, possess as much talent as most in the Premiership but their lack of killer instinct is alarming. This match was almost as one-sided as the one that Souness watched on television last March, and the hard work that Blackburn made of it told the manager that the progress he has overseen is not yet sufficient. \"We've just got to start punishing teams and putting them out of their misery,\" Souness said. \"I don't know quite how many we could have scored today but we could have sent our fans home very happy. I take blood-pressure tablets and, the way things are going, I'm going to have to ask my doctor to give me a stronger dose. \"We missed far too many chances and that's something we've got to improve on, if only to make it an easier afternoon for the staff and the supporters. But this was a potential banana skin for us and it was important we won. So far so good over the holiday programme, but having had to chase the game for such a long time might work against us at Norwich [today].\" Jansen accepted his share of the blame for the fact that Blackburn were not home and dry long before the 68th minute, when he finally made amends for a series of earlier misses. One in particular, when he somehow missed from three yards early in the second half, will live long in the memory. \"I had to score after missing that one,\" he said. Despite his profligacy in front of goal, the 23-year-old forward is finally showing signs that he can fulfil the talent that brought him to Sir Alex Ferguson's attention as a youngster with Carlisle. With Jansen at the heart of all Blackburn's attacks, Crewe never looked likely to repeat their victory here last season. The Crewe manager Dario Gradi said: \"All I can ask is for my team to show character. Our whole team only cost \u00a372,000, compared to Blackburn's millions, but my aim isn't to be as good as Blackburn. It's to be as good as we can be.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
