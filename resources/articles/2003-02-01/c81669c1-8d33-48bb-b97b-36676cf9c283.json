Amos Elon is one of the rare examples. An acclaimed reporter in Europe and Washington at a time when Israeli foreign correspondents were a novelty, he returned home to become a perceptive analyst of his own country. His 1971 book The Israelis: Founders and Sons is still a classic portrayal of how a self-reliant and often short-sighted mentality developed among native-born \"sabra\" Israelis which was different from the utopian vision of the early Zionist settlers who arrived from Europe. In mid-career Elon made the lifestyle switch to which many other political journalists - and politicians - aspire but few achieve. He transformed himself into a scholar and historian, using his linguistic gifts to beaver away in the archives of various capital cities before retreating to a Tuscan farmhouse to put his material into book form. Already the author of acclaimed biographies of the Rothschild family and Theodor Herzl, the father of Zionism, Elon's latest book, a study of Jews in Germany, marks the climax of his intellectual change of interest from the present to the past. It is an impressive work of scholarship with many sub-themes, not least the rich issue of Jewish self-description and how it alters according to place, time and the pressure to assimilate. Yet Elon has not given up writing about contemporary Israel. In recent months he has produced a stream of essays in the New York Review of Books about the intractability of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His analysis and mood have become steadily more gloomy, and his latest article concludes: \"It may yet, I tremble at the thought, lead to results far more terrible than those we are now witnessing\". He finds Israel's election results this week \"so predictable. This is a traumatised society which is also a very bad judge of events. They vote for the same Sharon who promised them security and peace and hasn't delivered. They forget that, and rally to him in even greater numbers because he hits back hard against the Palestinians,\" he says. Elon's dark view of the future raises the question of whether his devotion to historical research serves as a form of psychological retreat from the contemporary barrenness of Israeli public life, just as his relocation to Italy seems to be a geographical escape. Although many other Israelis live abroad, Elon is one the few Israeli writers who do. He carries an Israeli passport but spends most of his time in the house near Lucca which he and his American wife Beth bought decades ago as a summer home. He writes in an upstairs room with a view of red-tiled houses and a church tower peeping out above olive trees across a narrow valley. He entertains on a terrace shaded by a prolific plum tree. They moved to Italy when his wife gave up her work as a literary agent three years ago, but still spend their winters in Jerusalem, although this winter they were in the United States, where he was a visiting professor at New York University. \"In a certain sense he's the first post-Zionist\", says Clinton Bailey, an ethnographer, historian and neighbour from Elon's Jerusalem years. \"He's always been rather ambivalent about Zionism. The first part of his book, The Israelis, was given over to the Zionist experience but then it moves on to another track, suggesting that maybe Jews are really a diaspora people. He ends up living in a place like Italy where Jews have been more comfortable than almost anywhere\". Tom Segev, one of the leading Israeli historians of the British Mandate period, calls Elon's absence from Israel \"very sad\"; his calm reason is desperately needed at home, Segev says, although he does not see it as a betrayal of Israel - \"The whole of Israeli society was moving towards post-Zionism until the intifada. Part of the process of Israel's becoming less Zionist is a change of attitude towards Israelis who live abroad. You can live in Israel and be a post-Zionist, or you can live outside Israel. In Elon's case, his intellectual world doesn't require him to live anywhere in particular.\" Post-Zionism is a complex term. It can apply to the school of thought which believes the original Zionist project has been fulfilled, and that there is no longer any need to call for a great in-gathering of Jews, let alone that historic \"Judaea and Samaria\", the Palestinian-populated West Bank, has to be colonised and annexed. But post-Zionism is also used loosely as a label for the work of the revisionist historians in Israel who have been producing a more balanced account of the 20th-century history of Jewish-Palestinian relations and demystifying the underdog image of Jewish heroism triumphing against overwhelming odds. \"I see nothing of this kind of post-Zionism in Elon. Nor has he ever supported the vision of a bi-national state once put forward by Ha'shomer Ha'tzair or parts of Mapam\" [a socialist-Zionist party in the early years of the Israeli state], says Professor David Cesarani, a Southampton University scholar of Jewish history. \"His book The Israelis was a fantastic insight into the people who went to Palestine and why, and Elon is a great voice of sanity. But he still adheres to the ideas of Zionist socialism. He's a conventional old-fashioned Zionist, who supports Israel within the 1967 borders and believes the expansionist project must be abandoned.\" The irony of the discussion about Elon and post-Zionism is that most of his work has been on pre-Zionism, particularly in the German-speaking world where his parents and family lived. The title of his new book, The Pity of It All: A Portrait of Jews in Germany, 1743-1933, published by Penguin this week, is deliberately understated. The message, with its Aristotelian overtones of tragedy and catharsis, is that Hitler was avoidable. Elon is not one of those who believe the emergence of a racist dictator with a programme of mass murder was the climax of a long and irresistible tide of anti-semitism in German life, and that Jews who thought they could live safely in Germany were naive. Elon writes: \"Some claim to have discerned an inexorable pattern in German history pre-ordained from Luther's days to culminate in the Nazi holocaust... Such absolute certainties have eluded me. I have found only a series of ups and downs and a succession of unforeseeable contingencies, none of which seems to have been inevitable.\" Until its unification towards the end of the 19th century, Germany was a series of principalities and city-states with differing social and political climates. There was never a total expulsion of Jews as there was from England and Spain, although several German cities did expel them. Anti-semitism rose and fell in different places at different times. Elon writes that Frankfurt, though later one of the more liberal German cities, was perhaps the most oppressive place for Jews in western Europe in the 18th century. \"Only Rome and the Papal states treated Jews as harshly,\" he adds. Starting with Moses Mendelssohn, the religious thinker and first practising Jew to be assimilated into German intellectual life, and ending with the historian and philosopher Hannah Arendt, Elon's characters are all people of the enlightenment who worshipped German civilisation. They were involuntary outsiders whose \"true religion was the bourgeois Goethean ideal of Bildung (high culture)\" but who \"retained an outsider's sharpened sensibility and wakefulness\". Along with the thinkers and poets, this highly educated or self-educated group of Jews produced some of Germany's greatest polemicists, satirists, literary critics and connoisseurs of avant-garde art. \"The book is in a way a history of assimilation\", Elon says. \"Zionists never engaged with the history of assimilation. To them it was subversion.\" In the United States, where The Pity of It All appeared last autumn, some reviewers have complained that it focuses too much on upper-middle-class and secular Jews. Walter Laqueur in the Los Angeles Times said it \"deals essentially with the great figures of that period, the wealthy and the famous. But the great majority of German Jews were neither Nobel prizewinners nor multimillionaires, but middle-class merchants or lower-middle-class artisans or even working-class people... [Could one have a history of] Jews in Britain that concentrated on Disraeli, Viscount Samuel and Siegfried Sassoon?\". In the New York Times Steven Zipperstein wrote: \"Perhaps it is because Elon seems interested almost exclusively in those who he declares at the book's beginning were 'the best among them', those who 'tended to be indifferent to all religion and to view both their Jewish and their German heritage with detached irony', that he gives scant attention to the vast majority of German Jews, whose relationship with both German and Jewish culture was, not infrequently, far more earnest and less ironic, and was born of a desire somehow to embrace - or at least include - both. Elon pays no attention to the development of Reform Judaism or, for that matter, neo-Orthodoxy or Conservative (then called Historical) Judaism, all of which offered influential, distinctively German-Jewish responses to modernity.\" To forestall similar comments in England, Elon and his English publisher changed the subtitle from \"a history\" to \"a portrait\" of German Jews. But Elon says he deliberately focused on certain Jews who interested him\"... those who were cosmopolitan and secular militants for a multicultural society which would go beyond national cliches,\" he says. He is particularly fascinated by the complex inter-relationship between educated Jews who wanted to be complete Germans and Germans who respected Jews but could not fully accept them. \"Before Hitler rose to power, other Europeans often feared, admired, envied, and ridiculed the Germans; only Jews seemed actually to have loved them,\" he writes. The irony of this sentiment is of course terrible in the light of what befell Germany's Jews, and the book aims to explain Jewish attitudes in the period leading up to Hitler. Elon's own parents were Zionists who left Austria for Palestine in 1928, two years after he was born, and long before the menace of Hitler was apparent. In Tel Aviv, where his father had an export-import buisness, they continued to speak German at home and had mainly German-speaking friends. Amos has one sister, who still lives in Tel Aviv. At the end of the second world war Jewish immigration was rising and tensions with Palestinians grew as Zionist paramilitaries mounted a campaign against British rule and for a Jewish state. After two years of reading law at Tel Aviv university, Elon joined the Hagana, the forerunner of Israel's army. He served for three years. In 1950 he resumed his studies, this time at Jerusalem's Hebrew University where he switched to history. On graduation he won a British Council scholarship to Peterhouse in Cambridge in 1953 and studied under the eye of the conservative historian Professor Herbert Butterfield, who made a lasting impression. \"I remember two things in particular which Butterfield said,\" Elon says: \"'History is just one bloody thing after another' and 'No border is ever secure until it makes the other side absolutely insecure, and so it makes the next war inevitable'.\" The liberal-left newspaper Ha'aretz had given Elon a vacation job in 1951 as a provincial reporter in Tiberias. He had also written an acclaimed investigative piece, posing as a Romanian Jewish immigrant, on the bureaucratic hassles and other problems facing newcomers in Israel. On his return from Cambridge two years later it was natural for Ha'aretz to appoint him to the staff. He was given a job as a roving correspondent in Europe, \"a wonderful assignment\", he says, since he only had to write once or twice a month and had plenty of time to travel. \"They even created a poster for my articles - 'An Israeli in Europe',\" he beams. He was in Poland for the strikes in Poznan in 1956 when workers denounced Soviet rule, and in Hungary when the Russians sent in tanks to crush a nationalist uprising. Seen as a rising star, he was sent to Washington, where he spent six years. While there, he met Beth Drexler, who was working for the Democratic Senator Hubert Humphrey. They have a daughter, Danae, who became a sergeant in the Israeli army but is now a TV documentary-maker living in New York. She has just collaborated with a Palestinian on a film for Israeli TV. Soon after the couple's return to Israel, Elon was back on the road, this time in Paris and Bonn. One result of that period was his book Journey through a Haunted Land: The Two Germanies. Not surprisingly, the book centres on the issue of how post-war Germany was coming to terms with its past. Elon sought out the two literary men of conscience, Heinrich B\u00f6ll and G\u00fcnter Grass. \"It was a time when there was great interest in Germany in the Jewish culture which had been lost. I remember a clergyman in Brandenburg, lamenting to me how terribly dull life was without the Jews and their wit and vivacity,\" Elon says. \"I was impressed by the bit in Grass's novel Dog Years where a character has magic glasses through which you can see people in the clothes and uniforms they used to wear. I had the same feeling. When you met people, you never knew whose hand you were shaking. The judiciary, for example, were the same people who had served under Hitler.\" Elon wrote the book in German \"because I really wanted to get into their shoes. The book was highly critical, but most Germans took the fact that it was in German as a compliment.\" He returned to Israel in 1965 to join Ha'aretz's editorial board, and concentrate on Israeli issues. The Six-Day War in 1967, in which Israel defeated the armies of Egypt, Syria and Jordan and began its occupation of the West Bank was a watershed for the country and for Elon. He became a passionate critic of Israel's expansion. To him Zionism had always been a secular movement, heavily influenced by other nationalist movements in 19th-century Europe, though it had unique features. It never had the support of state power or, with a few exceptions, the upper class. The first settlers were idealists or anarchists. \"I hate that word Zionism. There's a religious quality to it. I prefer to look it as a Jewish national movement,\" Elon says. His view owes much to two people he admired. As a 20-year-old he had worked briefly as a researcher for the writer Arthur Koestler. \"Koestler had a premonition that if the religious Jews took over, it would be a disaster,\" Elon recalls. \"Hannah Arendt also saw that. She said it would lead to war.\" Elon also likes to quote Theodor Herzl's comment that Zionism was a movement which could least afford to make mistakes. He quotes the deathbed quip attributed to Herzl - \"Don't commit any idiocies while I'm dead.\" Elon says, \"I often think back to that remark. For a relatively long time after 1948 it was observed. Starting with David Ben-Gurion, Israel was led by wise and cautious men, experienced in the ways of Europe. They were conscious of limitations and ready for compromise.\" It was this which helped win Israel international legitimacy until 1967, when the mood changed. Ben-Gurion, by then in retirement, wanted Israel to hand back the occupied territories immediately, but two generals, Moshe Dayan and Yigal Allon, who were in the cabinet, led the resistance to any concessions. Elon sees them as the architects of Israel's later troubles, not only for their hardline security policies but for introducing and emphasising the concept of historical rights to land. Until then Israel had \"an existential basis, derived from the Holocaust,\" Elon argues. \"I was repelled by the notion of historical rights. It exists in German history, Irish history, Serb history. It always leads to disaster. If there's any lesson in European history, it is precisely this.\" There was a complete failure to under stand Palestinians. Elon recalls a lunch he had with Dayan in the King David hotel in Jerusalem. \"He believed that if you didn't interfere with Palestinians in their daily lives, the occupation would be OK. I said to him, 'These people also have national ambitions'. I remember Dayan's reply as clear as anything: 'What is this West Bank? It's just a handful of small townships'.\" In discussions with Ha'aretz's editorial board, Elon regularly challenged the concept of historical rights long before it led to the huge and fateful movement of settlers on to the West Bank and Gaza. Other young writers such as Amos Oz took a similar line, but Elon was probably the most prominent journalist among them. Although the government was not listening, it was an exciting time for intellectuals and bon viveurs, according to Clinton Bailey. \"There was a certain modishness and popularity in being at the cutting edge of liberalism. There was no risk of being sent away, and you could still have dinner with ministers even as you attacked their line. Jews had access to the Old City and you could get cases of wine sent over from the monastery in Bethlehem.\" \"Elon was intelligent, educated, a very good writer. With his easy-going charm, he was nicknamed 'The Viennese',\" recalls Eliahu Salpeter, for many years a fellow-member of the Ha'aretz board. Elon hammered away in his columns for six years, but says he was in a minority of one and getting increasingly shrill as his arguments went unheeded by politicians and barely supported by the rest of the Ha'aretz team. He did not mind being attacked. He just became frustrated that his case failed to get through. In an aside, he says the accusation which has become so popular among right-wing Jews that Jewish critics of Zionism are \"self-haters\" was first used by the journalist Theodor Lessing in the 1930s. \"In a discussion on Israeli TV some reactionary once asked me 'Are you one of those self-haters?'. I replied 'No, I don't hate myself. I just hate Jews like you'. Of course you could never say that on a TV programme in any other country,\" he laughs. Elon abandoned daily journalism and went freelance, writing and lecturing. A chance meeting in Harvard in 1973 with Sana Hassan, a young writer from a highly-placed Egyptian family, led to a series of conversations, published in 1974 as Between Enemies: A Compassionate Dialogue Between an Israeli and an Arab. Nowadays the title sounds quaint, but the book helped end the taboo on Israeli-Egyptian contacts which Egypt's President Anwar Sadat was to bury with his visit to Jerusalem in 1977. At the time the book appeared Sadat was furious with Sana Hassan, whose husband was the president's chief of staff, and he was forced to divorce her. For the next five years Elon visited Egypt for three months every year. Zeev Schiff, now the doyen of Israel's military analysts, who also travelled there regularly for Ha'aretz, says, \"Amos was very quick in establishing contacts. I was looking for guns and bad intentions. He was looking for smiles and the best of intentions.\" But Elon has never lost his critical touch. His recent articles on the Palestinian national movement are far from complimentary. \"Sometimes it's hard to know who he hates most, Arafat or Sharon. He's part of the great tradition of leftwing Zionism and Jewish radicalism,\" says Cesarani. Elon's prevailing mood on the Israeli-Palestinian stalemate is bleak. Confidence in a two-state solution is eroding, with extremists on both sides in the ascendant, he believes. The settlements are almost irreversible, he fears, partly because of the cost of compensating their inhabitants if they retreat, but mainly because the settlers have enough influence to dominate any possible Israeli coalition government. \"It was almost impossible to move 3,000 settlers out of Sinai under Begin. Now there are 400,000,\" he says. While Israeli control over the Palestinian majority on the West Bank increasingly relies on brute force, the morality of the Israeli army is going downhill: \"Soldiers loot nowadays,\" he says, \"they looted banks in Ramallah.\" He does not believe protests by Israeli reservists will get far enough to force the government to withdraw. Israel's leadership is worse than it has ever been, he argues, and the country is in thrall to politicians whose only skill is in manipulating the electorate to believe there is no room for compromise. The alternative scenarios which Elon foresees are grim. One is a wholesale ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from the West Bank. The other is a \"greater war, possibly nuclear, chemical, and biological\". If there were ever hope that the United States would act to restrain Israel, Elon sees no chance of that under the present administration in Washington. He recently spent three months in New York, which confirmed his view that the US has \"a missionary regime which wants to be top dog in the world\". The combination of a short-sighted and hardline American administration and an equally blinkered government in Jerusalem is dire, he believes, and the idiocies which Theodor Herzl warned against have never been more lethal.
