As long as he gets a few games for Manchester City between now and the World Cup he will remain in Roy Hodgson's plans. Jack Wilshere need not worry about rushing back for Sunday's game against Manchester United as, even if he cannot play, he will still be considered for the England friendlies against Chile and Germany. And though Steven Gerrard will be 34 at the next World Cup and appears to be hinting at international retirement afterwards, Hodgson will have a go at changing his mind if he thinks he can contribute something beyond Brazil. \"As a coach I will always be trying to keep what I think are the best players,\" Hodgson said on naming Southampton's Adam Lallana and Jay Rodriguez in a squad that once again aimed to strike a balance between experience and youthful promise. \"I'm just going to bring a very pragmatic approach to the situation, choosing who I think are the best players, and I'm convinced that anyone who gets handed the shirt, whether they have played the last four games for their club or not, will go out and do the job.\" Apart from nationality the main difference between Hodgson and predecessors such as Fabio Capello and Sven-Goran Eriksson is that he came to the job with his eyes open. Capello was startled when he realised how small a pool of talent there was to work with in the mother country and, though he set out with a principled policy of only selecting players who were appearing regularly for their clubs, when the crunch came he was forced to adapt. Eriksson was repeatedly frustrated by injuries to key players at crucial moments, either towards the end of a season or in the middle of a tournament, so much so that he made himself unpopular by demanding a winter break that the FA was in no position to sanction. Hodgson knows the score. Not only does he have fewer players to select from than leading international rivals but, come the World Cup, they will be weary and quite possibly injured. \"That's the way it is,\" he said. \"We all know there aren't enough English players playing regularly at the top level, only four or five English players started in the Champions League this week, for example, but the first thing you need to accept as a national coach is that you are at the mercy of clubs and club managers. \"They make their decisions and you have to make yours to fit round them. I certainly don't intend to have a rule that, if you don't play for your club side, you don't play for England. I will never go that far. On the other hand I'm not prepared to say either that, if you never get a game for your club, don't worry because you will always be a part of the England set-up. \"Joe Hart, for instance, only lost his place a couple of games ago. If we get to February and March and he still isn't playing, or has been replaced, then that's a problem, but at the moment he is still the keeper I rate No1 and I'm still picking him. It is obvious we do not have as many goalkeepers to choose from as we once did but in that position it is more about quality than quantity. We also have Ben Foster, Fraser Forster, John Ruddy and Jack Butland, and we should be able to find a good goalkeeper out of those five.\" Hart is likely to start against Germany, a bold choice of opponents considering the runaround England were given in Bloemfontein in the game that drew an emphatic line under their participation in the last World Cup. Hodgson is all too aware that the present feelgood factor might not survive a similar result, and also that the Germans have managed a continuity of selection that England have found elusive. \"I was quite surprised to discover Germany can boast seven players who have played in 75% of their qualification games,\" he said. \"We have only three. They seem to have been a bit luckier with injuries.\" While Eriksson was of the opinion that something other than luck was at work, Hodgson sees little point in arguing for a rest period now. \"I've been told not to continue talking about winter breaks,\" he said. \"It is a subject for discussion but for me at the moment it doesn't serve any purpose. There won't be a winter break this year, that's for sure, so as far as Brazil is concerned it doesn't feature highly on my list of priorities. There are more pressing issues.\" Trying not to lose 4-1 to Germany might be considered one of those but the Winner-esque message from Hodgson to the nation is \"Keep calm, it's only a friendly\". \"It will be a massive test for us if Germany put their best team out,\" the England coach said. \"But whatever happens at Wembley won't be the same as meeting a top nation in a tournament. Nothing can reproduce that. We have just taken four points off Brazil in two friendlies. Does that make us the better team? Will Brazil be shaking in their boots if we meet next summer? I don't think so.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
