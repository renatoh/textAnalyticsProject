What made this feat remarkable was that, by then, he had already suffered from Parkinson's disease for 15 years. He had fought the disease from the day he was diagnosed and brought his remarkable insights to bear in a memorably frank book, Shadow Over my Brain, published in 2000. He initially sought a psychoanalytic explanation for his illness, believing that something in his childhood, perhaps some unresolved conflict, may have caused it, and for two decades he underwent just about every standard and experimental medical treatment as well as a range of alternative therapies, some of them bizarre. But the only treatment of any lasting significance was the chemical dopamine. Todes was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, the son of Lithuanian-Jewish immigrants; his mother died a painful death from gallstone complications three weeks before his seventh birthday. Educated at King Edward VII school, Johannesburg, he attended Witwatersrand University, where he qualified as a dentist but, uncomfortable with apartheid, he emigrated to Britain in 1954. He worked as a dentist while studying for a higher qualification, the fellowship in dental surgery of the Royal College of Surgeons. Yet, by then he realised that dentistry was not for him, preferring a career in psychoanalysis. In pursuit of his new ambition he entered the West London medical school, which took mature students, in 1957, qualifying in 1960, and spent two years working in junior hospital jobs before heading to New York in 1962 to work in an analytically based psychiatric hospital. He then worked in a busy mental hospital in Boston attached to Harvard University. While waiting to go to the US he had met an American girl, Lili Loebl, who walked into his practice needing treatment. She was the Newsweek correspondent to the United Nations. They married in 1964. Returning to Britain, he worked at Halliwick hospital and the Tavistock clinic, both in north London, the latter run by the distinguished child psychiatrist John Bowlby, author of the classic study Child Care and the Growth of Love. From there he moved to the Hampstead child therapy clinic, run by Anna Freud, daughter of Sigmund, over whose methods they quarrelled. During this time he rented an attic with a brass bed from the writer Beryl Bainbridge, with whom he remained friends. He later worked at Paddington Green children's hospital under child psychiatrist Donald Winnicott, who wrote the important work The Child, the Family and the Outside World. He was 39 when he noticed a tremor in his left hand. It was his daughter's fourth birthday party. His GP immediately diagnosed Parkinson's. Within a year he started searching for a cure. L-dopa, a drug which increases dopamine levels, had just been discovered. Though his symptoms were mild, it was then thought that drugs might alter the course of the disease, so he took large doses, which sometimes caused grimacing. Over the next 20 years he tried every therapy under the sun. He tinkered with doses of Sinemet, a tablet containing L dopa and other chemicals, which made him manic when he took too little and caused grimacing when he took too much. He had crises when he was off work and sometimes in hospital, and took early retirement when he was 57. He went doctor-shopping, bypassing his GP, trying acupuncture, and biofeedback, a once fashionable procedure to bring the body under control, as well as taking dangerous doses of iron, enduring a nonsensical elimination diet and prescription anti-Parkinson drugs. A drug called teguride showed promise but caused psychosis in overdose; Dr Jos\u00e9 Obeso at the Opus Dei hospital in Pamplona, Spain, was trialling it using a continuous pump called a bomba. He went there for treatment in the mid-1980s and found it so horrific that, aided by Lili, he did a moonlight flit. In 1988 he underwent, under local anaesthetic, a transplant of fetal brain cells. It didn't work. A year later he had a heart attack and, having neglected his physical fitness, the rehab he was prescribed did more for his Parkinson's than any other treatment. He continued in private practice until 1992, treating patients at his home. Todes loved music and was a regular at London's Wigmore Hall. He is survived by Lili, two sons and a daughter. \u00b7 Cecil Jacob Todes, child psychiatrist, born May 29 1931; died June 5 2008 \u00b7 This article was amended on Wednesday August 13 2008. The editing of this obituary made dopamine a hormone rather than a chemical, and Sinemet a drug rather than a tablet containing L dopa and other chemicals.
