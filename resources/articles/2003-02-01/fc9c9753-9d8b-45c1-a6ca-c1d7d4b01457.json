As far as the protesting went, what transpired here last night was something more approaching apathy. So much for an evening of spiteful vitriol. Peter Ridsdale may have arrived at the stadium with some trepidation but there was to be no ceremonial shirt-burning or public ripping-up of season tickets, and few discernable chants imploring someone, anyone, to \"Sack the board\". Instead, Leeds fans heralded the first home game since Jonathan Woodgate's \u00a39m sale to Newcastle by answering their manager's plea and merely supported their side. The spattering of banners smuggled into the arena did not stay up for long, with Mark Viduka's early goal deflating the more vocal dissidents as much as First Division opponents. One placard at the front of the Revie stand demanded the chairman stopped \"killing LUFC\" but grim realisation appeared to have belatedly taken hold in this disgruntled pocket of west Yorkshire. \"It's calmed down a little bit now,\" conceded Chris Daniels, a season-ticket holder from Doncaster whose air of resignation was shared by most. \"People are starting to realise that the gamble simply hasn't paid off. It's nothing sinister, just disappointing. The \u00a3100m or so invested in players has backfired and more and more people are seeing that what Mr Ridsdale is saying makes sense.\" \"We are still angry at seeing the club going backwards after all the progress of the last few years,\" added David Walls, one of many who vented his spleen at Goodison Park on Saturday but was becalmed last night. \"Three years ago we were looking up, wondering what might be achieved. Now that's all changed and everyone's wondering where we might actually be going.\" But only when Leeds retorted to the visiting fans' taunts midway through the first half with a chorus of growling boos did their disaffection momentarily surface. The visit of West Ham in the Premiership on Saturday could yet prove a more volatile platform on which the protest could be mounted. The fact that Leeds partisans had actually received some rare good news yesterday amidst the general doom and gloom may have ex plained the muted atmosphere. Alan Smith, sidelined last night with flu, and Jamie Milner are on the brink of signing new deals, with Harry Kewell and Danny Mills likely to follow suit. Already, the \u00a39m Woodgate fee is being spent. Smith and his agent Alex Black met Ridsdale yesterday with the 22-year-old England striker and lifelong Leeds fan agreeing on a new 3-year contract worth \u00a340,000-a-week. \"The contract has to be drafted up, but we would expect to get it signed later this week,\" said Black. \"No one can deny Alan's commitment to the club.\" Nor, indeed, Milner's with the Premiership's youngest ever goalscorer aiming to sign his first professional contract by the end of the week. The 17-year-old is currently on \u00a3250-a-week scholarship deal though that weekly figure, with the help of his representative from the Professional Footballers' Association, should soon inflate to around \u00a32,000 on a four-year deal. Given the recent mass exodus of talents from these parts, that news will have prompted sighs of relief from those shivering inside Elland Road, though last night nowhere will such sentiment have been felt more keenly than in the directors' box."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
