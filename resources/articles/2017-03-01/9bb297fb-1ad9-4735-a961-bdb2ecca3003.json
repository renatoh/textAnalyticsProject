Hartley toed the party line \u2013 that Farrell had suffered an injury after a collision with Jones\u2019s dog, Annie \u2013 but did so with a telling roll of the eyes before stating: \u201cI asked if he was OK and he said yes. Owen Farrell is a tough boy... I\u2019m not going to waste much headspace because I\u2019m fairly confident he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Jonathan Joseph, who has been recalled to England\u2019s starting lineup at outside-centre, also shone more light on the situation of his midfield partner by saying: \u201cHe\u2019ll be completely fine. He\u2019ll be out there on Saturday.\u201d Jones, however, produced little but smoke and mirrors. \u201cOwen could be a doubt. He\u2019s got a bad leg, so he couldn\u2019t finish training. He\u2019ll be all right,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he ran into my dog. My dog was running around and he ran into it.\u201d When it was pointed out to Jones that he had given conflicting answers over Farrell\u2019s fitness, he replied: \u201cYeah, but I think he\u2019ll be all right. Is that OK?\u201d And when it was put to him that Annie was not responsible, he added: \u201cYou don\u2019t know that. \u201cAnnie is a pretty tricky runner and sometimes she gets off the leash. He just ran into someone at training \u2013 as simple as that. He\u2019ll be all right, possibly.\u201d Jones was not willing to explain what Farrell\u2019s injury was, though it is understood it was to a leg and he was seen leaving Thursday\u2019s training session, watched by the Lions coach Warren Gatland, early as a result. Though Farrell plays at inside-centre, he offers fly-half cover to George Ford; and Saracens\u2019 Alex Lozowski was reportedly at England\u2019s Bagshot training base despite being omitted from the squad on Tuesday. Jones\u2019s contradictory comments came two days after pictures emerged of whiteboards at a training session which appeared to show England\u2019s intended starting lineup. The whiteboards were not 100% accurate, though they did feature 14 of the 15 starters with Joseph, Ben Youngs and Jack Nowell returning. Billy Vunipola, who made his first Saracens appearance since a knee injury in November last weekend, was deemed fit enough only for a place on the bench. \u201cHe\u2019s always in with a chance; he\u2019s one of our best players but he\u2019s not ready to start yet,\u201d added Jones. \u201cWe didn\u2019t say he was going to start. The boards weren\u2019t left out by accident.\u201d Nathan Hughes retains his place at No8 but will be expected to make way when Vunipola is considered ready to start. \u201cIt was a bit of excitement for me \u2013 another person with great experience and a lot of caps under his belt,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cThis week we have been pushing each other and training well together and it will show on the weekend.\u201d Jones was also reluctant to discuss Saturday\u2019s opposition and when asked about Scotland\u2019s team selection that includes the in-form openside flanker Hamish Watson, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not worried about what Scotland does all I\u2019m worried about is us. Whatever they serve up we\u2019ll deal with.\u201dAll of the above deflects attention from the fact that England are pursuing a record-equalling 18th consecutive victory on Saturday but are not playing particularly well whereas Scotland, who have not won at Twickenham since 1983, are. Indeed England have not been ahead at half-time in their last four matches. \u201cWe\u2019ve been ahead at the 80th minute mark and that\u2019s the only time that counts,\u201d said Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s like starting a 100 metre race \u2013 you can be ahead at the 10m mark but you\u2019ve got to be in front at the 100m mark.\u201d Meanwhile both Hartley and Nathan Hughes gave their backing to England supporters singing \u2018Sweet Low, Sweet Chariot\u2019. A recent report in the New York Times featured criticism by American academics of the cultural appropriation of a song about slavery. \u201cI like it that the fans are behind us and they give us a boost to go that extra 10%,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cIt lifts the players on the field as well,\u201d Hartley added: \u201cI don\u2019t know the history. To me Swing Low is the England rugby song. \u201cI\u2019ve known that as a kid, growing up in New Zealand. To us it\u2019s the noise, the sheer atmosphere it generates and the feelgood factor it gives Twickenham.\u201d England team to face Scotland M Brown; J Nowell, J Joseph, O Farrell, E Daly; G Ford, B Youngs; J Marler, D Hartley (capt), D Cole, J Launchbury, C Lawes, M Itoje, J Haskell, N Hughes.
