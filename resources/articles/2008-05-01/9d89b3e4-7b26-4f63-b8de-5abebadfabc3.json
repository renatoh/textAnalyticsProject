Sebastian Coe, the chairman of Locog, London's 2012 organising committee, and a Stamford Bridge season-ticket holder, had seats reserved in the directors' box at the Luzhniki Stadium to sit among the Chelsea party. But late last week Lord Coe was finding it difficult to secure passage out of Moscow in time to attend crucial meetings tomorrow, the last day of the International Olympic Committee's three-day visit to London. Although he was offered a seat on the team plane, it does not touch down in Gatwick until tomorrow afternoon. As there were no alternative return flights in time for one of the most important days in the Locog calendar, Coe reluctantly decided yesterday to call it off. \"It was always going to be a late fitness test,\" Coe told colleagues. He and his children will instead watch the match on television in their living room. Also missing will be Mick Hucknall, Simply Red's lead singer and a passionate United fan. Hucknall, who calls Sir Alex Ferguson a friend, will not be in Moscow as his band is performing in the on-course concert at golf's BMW Championship at Wentworth. He says he will attempt to record the second half and hopes, in the manner of the Likely Lads episode, to avoid all mention of the score until he watches it post-performance. Glory spells cash Chelsea and Manchester United are the world's two most indebted clubs with combined liabilities of \u00a31.5bn, as revealed in this newspaper yesterday, but a sizeable chunk of the winners' debt can be covered by income arising from tonight's match. According to research conducted by Simon Chadwick, professor of sport business strategy and marketing at Coventry University business school, winning the final will be worth \u00a385m. Chadwick's research, which was commissioned by Mastercard, finds that even the losing club will earn \u00a330m. That will come courtesy of intangibles such as increased squad value but also extra TV revenue and bonuses linked to existing commercial deals. With upwards of 40,000 English fans in attendance, Moscow also stands to make \u00a335m from hosting the event. Bobbies in Red Square Standing alongside the 7,000 Russian police on duty tonight will be 18 British surveillance officers with experience of spotting known hooligans. But after violence coinciding with Zenit St Petersburg's Uefa Cup final appearance in Manchester there are fears of attacks on English fans by local hooligan groups. Several followers of the England team were assaulted during their trip to the Luzhniki Stadium last year. Moscow's municipal authority has pledged to use anglophone operators today to deal with emergency calls. Trinidad told to pay up Shaka Hislop, Stern John and Kenwyne Jones have won a first victory of their close season after an arbitration ruling found that the Trinidad &amp; Tobago Football Federation should pay its 2006 World Cup squad 50% of net profits in accordance with pre-tournament promises. The verdict, which is subject to a confidentiality clause, was leaked to the Trinidad Guardian on Monday after a hearing in London last month but the players must now establish what the TTFF generated from their participation. They have contended that it raised tens of millions of pounds through sponsorship and government grants. No going back Betfair settled the markets relating to all but one of the 45 matches highlighted in tennis's Gunn-Rees report released yesterday. If matches are found to have been won illegally it might open the bookmaker to claims from cheated punters. However, despite there being provision in Betfair's regulations for the reversal of settled bets, senior sources at the company say it is unlikely to do so \"ex post facto\". There is a precedent: Betfair stuck by the podium result of the 2003 Brazilian grand prix when Kimi Raikkonen was mistakenly handed victory, even though Giancarlo Fisichella was later named as the race winner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
