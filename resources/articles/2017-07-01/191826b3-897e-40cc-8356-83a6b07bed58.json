Real are aware of United\u2019s position but are undeterred and may soon indicate their desire to prise the 26-year-old away from Old Trafford. De Gea came close to joining Real two years ago when Louis van Gaal was the United manager. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho does not want the Spaniard to leave and United believe that, because he is not agitating for a move and has two years left on his contract, their position is far stronger than in 2015."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
