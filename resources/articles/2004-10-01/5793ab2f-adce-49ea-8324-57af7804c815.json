Howard Stern, the shock-jock radio host and the medium's biggest star for 20 years, announced he was leaving terrestrial radio and, as of 2006, going to work for the start-up satellite broadcaster Sirius. The move may come to signal the moment when subscription-based satellite radio, with hundreds of stations of largely commercial-free programming, became a serious force, as well as the moment the financially flat and creatively stagnant US radio business was forced to reinvigorate itself. Terrestrial radio has been losing audience share for years, and after a decade of consolidation is under fire for stripping out any individuality. Shock-jock Stern, whose capacity for pornographic and scatological talk knows few limits, will be paid $100 million a year for five years to move his carnival of comic banter and desperation to Sirius. To get the satellite industry off the ground, he said, a high-profile star 'had to make the move in a big way. I'm the only one to do it'. He said he was excited to make the move, describing it as 'the most important deal in radio history'. More to the point, Stern has been falling foul of his employer Infinity Broadcasting, a division of Viacom, and the Federal Communications Commission. A series of on-air pranks conducted by Stern and his team caused the company to be fined $1.75 million, the highest ever levied for indecency, and caused Clear Channel Entertainment, the Texas-based radio goliath, to drop his morning programme from seven of its stations. Stern did not try to disguise his enmity toward Clear Channel last week, saying it had succumbed to pressure from religious fundamentalists when it took him off the air. 'I want to make satellite radio so big it reduces Clear Channel to rubble.' Like cable television, satellite radio is not subject to federal indecency scrutiny because it is available only to paid subscribers. Stern said traditional radio 'doesn't allow me to be myself' and cited FCC restrictions as one of his main motivations. 'I'm tired of the censorship,' said Stern. 'The FCC has stopped me from doing business.' Over the last two years, he said, the comedy he was able to air had been restricted. Since Viacom's CBS was hit with a $550,000 FCC fine for showing Janet Jackson's breast during the Superbowl, bodily functions have gone the way of hard-core sex and been banned. 'I want to know why a grubby (but sometimes amusing) man and his comments are vilified when there are far more offensive actions being taken,' Stern said. 'I'll resist any political comments about sending military personnel to an unnecessary death but ask others to consider this as part of the bigger picture when compared to sexual innuendo, overt smut and frequent coarse language.' Beyond the loss to terrestrial radio (Stern brings in about $80m in ad revenue and $50m in cash flow) Sirius is taking a gamble. The company has lost $1 billion over the last five years and will have to add one million subscribers to make economic sense of hiring Stern. Founded in 1990 as Satellite CD Radio Inc, New York-based Sirius is battling XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Sirius is the underdog with 600,000 subscribers, compared to XM's more than 2 million. XM has its own bawdy talk-show team, Opie and Anthony, but it's as yet unclear whether consumers want talk on satellite radio or that the reason for having it is to get away from talk and the plague of commercials. In recent years, restricted playlists, endless commercials and station call-outs have, to many ears, made radio virtually unlistenable. Recently Clear Channel, the much-feared giant of the business, which owns more than 1,200 stations, said it was cutting back on the number and length of commercials because they were causing listeners to tune out. But Sirius has lagged in the all-important battle to get its product into cars. XM has deals with General Motors and Honda to pre-install XM in its new models and that deal alone should add 2 million customers next year. Sirius, which has a deal with Ford, is taking lessons from Rupert Murdoch. Signing Stern is akin to News Corp's Fox network snatching professional football away from CBS, or Sky buying Premier League football rights in the UK. Since Stern's show dominates the market among males aged 18 to 49 and ranks No 1 in many of the 46 markets it is broadcast, and given that this demographic is technologically confident, Sirius believes it will have no trouble signing up the extra million subscribers it needs by 2006. Last week, there were some who could not pretend they were sad to see Stern go. The American Family Association's Randy Sharp said: 'He should be happy, and we're happy he's off the publicly owned airwaves. Quite frankly, we hope one day he sees the error of his ways and reforms his message to America.' Stern's move is also underscoring a broader debate about radio and television. As the niche quality cable station HBO has shown, terrestrial television consumers will pay for quality. Satellite radio attracts devoted subscribers with its bold array of choice and freedom from the interference of commercials. Moreover, radio is in need of a technological makeover. With the rise of digital television, iPods, TiVo and other devices, radio's reliance on analogue transmission is outdated. The advent of digital radio, with better reception, on-demand programming and time-shifting is on the horizon and should give consumers more freedom over when and how they listen. Whatever the future holds, Stern's announcement last week has given the entertainment business, and especially the music business, which has in many ways been crushed by the expense of getting its product on radio, reason for optimism. Jeff Jarvis, a media executive and author of the BuzzMachine blog, told the New York Times: 'We're going to mark today as a moment of sea change. This is going to be the breakthrough for satellite radio to become large enough to be a viable business.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
