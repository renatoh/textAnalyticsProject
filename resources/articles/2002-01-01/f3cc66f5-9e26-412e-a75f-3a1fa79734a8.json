A report by the political correspondent, Kirsty Walker, which appeared on the front page of today's Express, quotes Mr Denham, the minister responsible for crime reduction, as saying street crime was now so bad he feared for the safety of his children. \"I have a mobile phone, I have a family and I am a parent and sometimes I feel anxious about my family's safety and my own with growing street crime,\" Mr Denham was reported to have said. But when Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, challenged Mr Blair over the story in the Commons today, he was told Mr Denham had said \"no such thing\". The prime minister said Mr Denham had written to the editor of the Express denying he had made the comments. \"You quote me as saying 'sometimes I feel anxious about my family's safety and my own with growing street crime,'\" said Mr Denham. \"Your readers should know that I did not use these words and that they were made up by your reporter or a press agency.\" He added: \"The parent who never worries about their children does not exist. Tackling street crime is a priority. But making up stories is not going to help.\" The Express was unavailable for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
