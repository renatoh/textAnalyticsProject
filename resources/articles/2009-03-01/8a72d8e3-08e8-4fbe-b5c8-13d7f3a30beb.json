It was the hardest fought of Pendleton's four world titles in this discipline, going to three heats against Holland's Willy Kanis, with the final decided by a photo. It was also her most emotional. When the verdict was announced there were not the usual exuberant celebrations but a deluge of tears. Her relief was palpable, which perhaps owed something to this being Pendleton's first gold medal of the championships, to add to the silver and bronze she collected earlier in the week, and something to the fact that the British team are not dominating in Poland as they have done during the last two seasons. This was the team's second gold medal of the championships, after Wendy Houvenaghel's in the pursuit, but, reflecting the fact that the spoils are being shared across the board, it propelled Britain to second in the medals table, behind a resurgent Australia. Pendleton has the chance of another one today in the keirin, with Lizzie Armitstead also a decent bet in the points race. Still in tears as she came off the podium, Pendleton sought to explain her emotional reaction: \"I'm so relieved I can't explain. It's one of the greatest achievements of my career, because going straight back into training and racing after the Olympics was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. \"I was aware that no [2004] Olympic champion won the world title the following year, and that made the pressure to win greater. But I couldn't imagine not wearing this,\" she added, tugging at the rainbow jersey of world champion. Earlier, Mark Cavendish's hopes of defending his world Madison title ended in a crumpled heap on the wooden boards of the velodrome when his partner, Peter Kennaugh, suffered a high speed crash just as the race began to heat up. The British twosome had been riding a conservative race, saving themselves for a supreme effort towards the climax, similar to that which won Cavendish and Bradley Wiggins a thrilling title race last year in Manchester. But with 63 of the 200 laps remaining \u2013 and with Cavendish having initiated a break to gain a lap on the peloton \u2013 he was hit by one of the Colombian riders, who fell into the path of the rapidly approaching Kennaugh. The 19-year-old who, like Cavendish, hails from the Isle of Man, was left with nowhere to go other than straight into the stricken rider; and such was the impact of the crash that his bike was instantly smashed in two. While a spare was brought track-side, Kennaugh smacked the Perspex on the inside of the track with frustration. Cavendish continued in the race until, eventually, his team-mate was able to rejoin. It was effectively the end of their race, though, and they finally placed sixth, with Denmark the comfortable winners. \"I can't remember much about the crash,\" said Kennaugh, \"but it changed the course of the race.\" For Kennaugh and Cavendish, though, there is hope for the future, with both confirming that they would like to team up at the London Olympics. \"It felt really good,\" said Kennaugh of the partnership. \"I want to turn professional on the road, get a couple of grand tours in my legs, and I think the field will do well to keep up with me in London.\" Cavendish, who last week took the biggest win of his career in the Milan-San Remo classic, was just as bullish, describing the race as \"the most technically sound Madison I've ever had. It was about learning for the future, so we can be happy with our ride\". If Kennaugh was bruised physically, Britain's male sprinters will be suffering from wounded pride. After qualifying second, third and fourth in the 200m time trial, they fared less well in the match sprints, Matt Crampton losing in two straight rides to France's Kevin Sireau, and Jason Kenny, the Olympic silver medallist, surprisingly easily beaten, two-nil again, by another Frenchman, Gr\u00e9gory Baug\u00e9. Ross Edgar took his quarter-final to three rides against the Malaysian Azizul Hasni Awang \u2013 the diminutive sprinter who pulls a wheelie every time he launches his bike at the line \u2013 but lost the decider. There was small consolation for the trio when Crampton won the consolation race for fifth place, with Kenny sixth and Edgar eighth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
