She's also sent a text: \"House has been burgled. Pls call asap.\" I pray that she and our two children are OK, quickly pick my holdall off the carousel, nip to the bathroom to wipe my face, and call her back. \"Hi. It's me. Everything OK?\" \"We're fine. It was just a shock. They haven't taken much.\" \"Phew. How horrid for you\u2026 Er, is my coat OK? It was hanging in the entrance hall.\" \"Pardon?\" \"My new camel coat. I left it there the other day when I popped round to say goodbye to the kids\u2026\" \"Strangely, I haven't checked.\" Her sarcasm has arrived on the other side of the Atlantic all too intact. \"Yes, sorry, it's not important.\" A lie. It is important. In fact I'm praying they didn't take it. Camel's a hard colour to wear and it would be wasted on a pasty-faced youth. Not only that, but I'd bought the last one in my size. \"Is there anything I can do?\" I ask, trying to sound helpful. \"Not really; it feels a bit creepy that strangers were in our house. I just thought you should know.\" \"Francis Bacon ended up dating someone who broke into his house,\" I say, trying to paint a brighter picture. \"That is a comfort \u2013 thank you, Jason. If they come again, I'll be sure to give them your number.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
