I am the technical sales engineer for the US-owned brakes manufacturer Performance Friction. We specialise in providing brake discs and pads for racing cars and motorbikes, which for me, means liasing with the teams, and providing them with the products they require. I wanted to work in motor sport right from an early age. After school I did an apprenticeship working on Austin Healy classic sports cars - in effect, I trained as a car mechanic. After five years of that I decided to go to college and did a mechanical engineering degree at Liverpool. It gave me a good background in engineering, but there wasn't enough on cars. I then applied to car manufacturers for a job as a design engineer, but I couldn't get an interview. When I discovered the course at Cranfield it appeared to offer me a way into the industry, so I sold my beloved motorbike and signed up. Although we were the first intake of what was then a new course, it was well structured. We would have a week of lectures on a particular subject such as aerodynamics and this would be followed by a week working on a project, applying what we had just learnt. Between those weeks, we had two taught modules on the business of putting together a car to race, how to manage a project, and how to finance it. As a group we were challenged to design, cost out, and manage the project to build a car to be used to teach motor racing - similar to a Formula Ford. For my individual thesis I created a computer program to analyse the rear suspension of racing motorbikes. Throughout the year we had lectures from visiting industry figures, and I understand that Jackie Stewart does one there now. One of the best things about the course is its links to the motor sport industry. Before I started it I couldn't get a job interview, but I had three before I'd completed it - without even filling in an application form. Although I'm in a sales role, I still rely heavily on my technical knowledge and I know that the people I deal with appreciate my expertise. The fact that I'm also doing what I always wanted is fabulous. The only downside of being so heavily into your job is that your social life does tend to suffer somewhat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
