No wonder, then, that most journalists and memoir-writers strike preposterous poses in their attempts to convey music's enigmatic essence. The opening sentence of Joe Boyd's memoir of his early career as a producer raises fears that White Bicycles may be yet another display of heaving hyperbole: \"The Sixties began in the summer of 1956, ended in the autumn of 1973 and peaked just before dawn on Saturday, July 1, 1967.\" Thankfully, the book quickly settles down to become one of the most lucid and insightful music autobiographies I've read. With disarming self-confidence and a subtle smile, Boyd argues that his memoir \"disprove[s] at least one 60s myth: I was there, and I do remember\". Many veterans of that lysergic, dope-foggy decade are ill-equipped to be historians, but Boyd is in remarkable mental shape for someone who nursemaided such psychedelic classics as The Incredible String Band's The 5000 Spirits, Dr Strangely Strange's Kip of the Serenes, and Pink Floyd's debut single \"Arnold Layne\" (whose flip-side's original lyrics went \"Let's roll another one!\"). A Harvard-educated fellow from Princeton, New Jersey, Boyd co-managed London's UFO Club during the flower-power era but, although he occasionally inhaled, he always kept his head - especially when he was in the recording studio control booth. His productions for Fairport Convention and Nick Drake have worn particularly well, eschewing gimmicky effects in favour of a clear, warm, intimate sound. Boyd is a complex man whose motives for becoming a producer are typically mixed. On the one hand he recalls the \"eureka moment\" when he realised that his intensely philosophical, visceral love for musical sound could be turned into a career - \"listening for a living!\". On the other hand, he confesses to a lifelong ambition to be an \u00e9minence grise, which took him to the cocaine-strewn boardrooms of Hollywood. The Joe Boyd who thrilled to the hippy exoticism of The Incredible String Band as he captured \"Cousin Caterpillar\" on tape scarcely seems the same man as the one who writes: \"Freddy Weintraub's office was my favourite stop on the executive floor at Warner Brothers Studios.\" But he is, and the contradictions are part of this book's appeal. Although Boyd has had a successful career by any standards, he details his failures and missed opportunities with some relish. Offered a chance in 1970 to buy the publishing rights to the future output of an obscure Swedish songwriting duo (namely Abba), he loses interest in the deal and goes off to Hollywood to produce the music for the movie Deliverance instead. The marketing execs suggest releasing \"Duelling Banjos\" as a single; Boyd humours them but is so convinced the record will sink without trace that he neglects to put his name on it. It becomes his only number one hit. Regrets are few, however, for the man who brought Muddy Waters to Britain for the first time, stage-managed Dylan's historic electric gig at Newport in 1965, discovered Nick Drake, produced Fairport Convention's folk-rock masterpiece Liege and Lief (one of the most influential LPs ever made) and ran a club which, week upon week, hosted groups such as Pink Floyd, Soft Machine, Family and Procol Harum. Music memoirs are often sunk by the \"you-had-to-be-there\" factor, particularly when it comes to allegedly glorious live performances by artists whose legacy of recordings is feeble or nonexistent. There are a few such moments here, as when one-hit-wonders Tomorrow deliver a \"tremendous\" concert that represents the era's absolute \"peak\" (the pre-dawn July 1 event referred to in the book's opening line). Mostly, though, Boyd demonstrates clear-eyed analysis and an unusual awareness of the broader picture. Indeed, White Bicycles is virtually unique among rock memoirs in its avoidance of woolly sentimentality and wild exaggeration. There is something of the scholar about Boyd, a detachment that belies his pivotal status as a participant. Occasionally, Boyd's self-discipline robs us of incidental pleasures that a more rambling raconteur might have offered. Describing a trip through the Deep South in search of authentic blues, he crafts single-sentence summaries of experiences that other writers would have spent paragraphs on. But there's more than enough vivid reminiscence to keep the book buoyant, and Boyd's prose can convey a lot in a few words. Recalling the Blues and Gospel Caravan tour he organised in 1964, Boyd notes that legendary blues buddies Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee \"cordially loathed\" each other offstage. Meeting Pink Floyd's dandyish managers in 1967, his first impression was that they \"looked like monkeys dressed up for a PG Tips commercial\". John Hopkins, his UFO Club confederate, is framed by a drug squad officer who, to clinch the bust, \"reached, conjurer-like, behind his sofa and pulled out an evidentiary plum\". The 16 pages of black and white photographs, like Boyd's text, capture evanescent history with remarkable clarity. Here is John Lee Hooker playing a blues all-nighter at Alexandra Palace, hunched in front of a crowd of solemn, nerdy white youngsters. Here are Bob Dylan and Joan Baez arm-in-arm with Pete Seeger and Peter, Paul &amp; Mary, warbling \"We Shall Overcome\". Here is Nick Drake, hesitantly stroking a keyboard with one hand and sucking on a cigarette with the other. Rock autobiographies usually rely on pre-existing devotion to the artists concerned. White Bicycles has, I think, enough of a grasp of larger issues - historical, philosophical, psychological - to be of interest to readers unfamiliar with the records Boyd produced. Such readers might be forgiven for not suspecting that Joe continued to play an important role in the 1970s, 80s and 90s, because White Bicycles sticks so scrupulously to its stated timeframe. Now that's self-discipline for you. \u00b7 Michel Faber's latest book is The Fahrenheit Twins (Canongate)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
