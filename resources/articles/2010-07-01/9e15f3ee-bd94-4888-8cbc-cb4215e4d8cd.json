Dwindling downstream water supplies and deteriorating water quality have now reached catastrophic levels in southern Iraq. There are also serious concerns about the disposal of US military hazardous waste. Saddam Hussein's deplorable draining of the marshes was not only a security measure, but a move to prepare the area for oil. The coming operations of multinational oil companies are a much greater danger than you suggest. Dr Kamil Mahdi Exeter \u2022 How strange to base a discussion of university funding around the cost of \u00a316,000 for a place at Oxford (Comment, 8 July). Where does this figure come from? What does it include? For purposes of comparison, an A-level student receiving about 20 hours' tuition a week and lots of marking of written work costs about \u00a36,000 a year. Tom Jupp London \u2022 If Erica Jeal really thinks London music lovers can \"wander up to the Albert Hall\" (The Perfect Proms, Film &amp; Music, 9 July) to hear Placido Domingo and Bryn Terfel, she should advise them to do it at least 24 hours before kickoff, and to take their sleeping bags. Harold Lewis Cobham \u2022 Your praise for the Normans (Editorial, 6 July) reminds me of Marcus Brigstocke explaining that education, parliament, the law and Mr Grimsdale all benefited from Norman wisdom. Daryl Kayes Leeds \u2022 What's this about Ronaldo paying \u00a310m to a surrogate mother (Lost in Showbiz, G2, 9 July)? Surely that's a transfer fee. Marco Livingstone London \u2022 So Nick Clegg thinks that people are warming to the coalition (Report, 10 July). He should get out more.
