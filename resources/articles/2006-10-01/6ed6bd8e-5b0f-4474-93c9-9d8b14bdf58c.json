There could only be one name for the race which began Martin Pipe Day here yesterday, when Cheltenham's new season got under way in honour of the 15-times champion jumps trainer, who retired in April. Hit Parade, in a humble seller at Taunton in 1975, was the first of 4,182 career wins for the man who rewrote what was then the winter game's record books. Returning to the course where he stacked up 34 Festival winners, making him the second most successful trainer at Cheltenham's showpiece meeting, Pipe revelled in the occasion but also had to endure a frustrating afternoon with his son David, who has taken over the reins at Pond House stables, denied a likely-looking victory when Abragante came down at the final fence in the penultimate race. Backed from 9-1 to 100-30 in morning exchanges, Abragante was the one that got away. The five-year-old, having his first run in a handicap on his chasing debut, had all the hallmarks of a Pipe (senior) special. \"I'm in the background, though whether it's helping or hindering David I'm not sure,\" said Pipe. \"But I still like plotting one up. The entry book is where the fun begins.\" It looked a lot different back in 1975 when Hit Parade was make-or-break for Pipe. Len Lungo was the jockey on board that day and yesterday the Scot, who made his mark on Martin Pipe Day when training the winner of the third race, Monolith, recalled how important it was for Hit Parade to win. \"Without a winner Martin's licence would have been restricted to amateurs' races the following season,\" he said. \"Before the race David Pipe [Martin's late father] told me 'Martin will never train a winner'. But I told him Hit Parade would win. \"The horse wasn't always the best of jumpers,\" recalled Lungo. \"So I got to Taunton early with a crowbar and loosened the inner flight of hurdles all the way round, just in case he hit one. But we made all the running and, in fact, he jumped well. The party went on for a week.\" The Pipe camp were unable to celebrate a winner yesterday, the tone for the day being set in the opener when Christdalo, in the David Johnson colours, blundered her chance away at the third-last flight of hurdles. Victory went to Lou Du Moulin Mas, trained by Paul Nicholls, the man who wrested the title from Pipe in April. Pipe's announcement of his retirement on Channel 4's The Morning Line coincided with Nicholls being crowned champion. Rivalry between the two has rarely been friendly, and yesterday Nicholls was pleased just to have trained another winner. \"You try and win races. It doesn't matter what day it is,\" he said. \"But Martin was a brilliant trainer.\" Looking ahead to next March, Nicholls cautioned anyone keen to back Kauto Star for the Queen Mother Champion Chase. \"He is very unlikely to run there unless the ground is really soft,\" he said. \"I was pleased with his win at Aintree on Sunday, and I'm sure he will get further than 2\u00bd miles. I think this year the race for him could be the two-mile-five Ryanair Chase, and I would say at this stage he is very unlikely to run in the Champion Chase, unless the ground was very, very testing. \"We are going to go for the King George with Kauto Star. I could definitely see him lining up for the Gold Cup one day, though I wouldn't know if it would be this year or in two years' time.\" Martin Pipe's legacy lived on yesterday, through the 51-1 treble completed by his former stable jockey, Tony McCoy. The third leg, on Butler's Cabin, came at the expense of Abragante and on this day you suspected even the ultra-competitive champion jockey would have forfeited that winner to see Team Pipe score. Showing all the fierce will to win of his former employer, McCoy had set the ball rolling on the 6-1 winner Backstage, trainer Evan Williams' first runner for owner Sir Robert Ogden, who stormed to a 16-length victory in the \"15 Times Champion Trainer Novice Chase\", the second race on the Pipe-themed card. McCoy had got down to 10st 5lb to ride the four-year-old and Williams smiled: \"He wasn't going to do that weight just to have a day out. Fortunately missing his tea and breakfast was well worth it.\" One horse McCoy will probably not be scoring on this season is his old chasing partner Iris's Gift, who will be Dominic Elsworth's mount in Saturday's Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby. Connections feel that as McCoy will be so often claimed for the JP McManus horses this year, the Stayers' Hurdle winner should form a new season-long partnership. \"Dominic rode the horse schooling 18 fences and reported that he jumped like a gazelle,\" said Iris's Gift's owner Robert Lester. Ron Cox's tip of the day Armariver 4.30 Cheltenham A shade disappointing since being disqualified after beating stable-mate Pirate Flagship here last season, Armariver has made a solid start this time and stands out at these weights. Third to Massini's Maguire at Chepstow after a last-flight blunder, Paul Nicholls' six-year-old was set to meet the winner on 21lb better terms here. \u00b7 Yesterday's selection Aston Lad obliged at 4-1 to follow up the 11-2 Monday nap, Kyles Prince."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
