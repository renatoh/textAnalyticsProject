George Moncur and Marvin Sordell gave the home side a 2-0 half-time lead and a perfect afternoon was blighted only by Reza Ghoochannejhad\u2019s late consolation for the Addicks. \u201cThere\u2019s only one club I want in the next round and that\u2019s West Ham,\u201d said the Colchester manager (and former West Ham player) Kevin Keen. \u201cIt would be a dream for me. We were fantastic, we got our rewards and everyone was absolutely top drawer. A few of them proved that they should be playing at a higher level.\u201d The Charlton interim head coach, Karel Fraeye, whose side lie 23rd in the Championship, said: \u201cWe put out a team that should be strong enough to beat Colchester and they were not \u2026 We are in the situation that we are in now and this battle will not stop.\u201d Colchester were not the only League One side to defeat Championship opposition, with Walsall putting out Brentford and their former manager Dean Smith thanks to Sean Mantom\u2019s first-half goal. Smith saw his former side the Saddlers ease into the fourth round at Griffin Park but vowed to \u201clook at the bigger picture\u201d, having rested four first-choice players due to fixture congestion. \u201cI did want to win the game, especially against my old club \u2026 I\u2019ll tell you if I did the right thing after the Burnley game.\u201d And Peterborough United also knocked out Championship opposition in the shape of Preston North End, with another manager \u2013 Posh\u2019s Graham Westley \u2013 getting one over a former club. Championship Ipswich Town survived a scare against League Two Portsmouth, with Mick McCarthy\u2019s side needing a late equaliser from Ryan Fraser to force a replay after a 2-2 draw at Portman Road. \u201cI thought they were excellent,\u201d said McCarthy. \u201cI was relieved to go in at half-time 0-0 though I did think we were better in the second half. We were below par but they are one of the better League Two teams.\u201d There were four home wins in five all-Championship ties. The 2014 finalists Hull City were 1-0 winners over Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, Steve Evans\u2019 Leeds United triumphed 2-0 over his former club Rotherham United, Burnley surprised the leaders Middlesbrough with a 2-1 win at the Riverside, Sheffield Wednesday won 2-1 against Fulham, and QPR extended their winless run against Nottingham Forest at the City Ground to 31 matches after a 1-0 defeat. Huddersfield Town and Reading face a replay after a controversial stoppage-time penalty allowed Nahki Wells to make it 2-2, and League Two Northampton Town took Championship strugglers MK Dons to a replay, with Ricky Holmes scoring twice in a 2-2 draw. The League One rivals Bury and Bradford City will also have to do battle again after a 0-0 draw at Gigg Lane. Blackburn Rovers\u2019 visit to Newport was postponed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
