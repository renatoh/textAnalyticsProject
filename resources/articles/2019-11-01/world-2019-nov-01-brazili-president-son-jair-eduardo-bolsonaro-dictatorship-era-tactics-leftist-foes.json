Eduardo Bolsonaro made the incendiary remarks \u2013 which many observers suspect were a deliberate distraction from renewed media speculation over the family\u2019s links to organized crime \u2013 during a softball YouTube interview broadcast on Thursday. In the interview the 35-year-old congressman claimed \u2013 without offering evidence \u2013 that the recent wave of Latin American protests and the left\u2019s return to power in Argentina were part of a Cuba-funded conspiracy to bring \u201crevolution\u201d to Latin America. \u201cIf the left radicalizes to this extent [in Brazil] we will need to respond, and that response could come via a new AI-5,\u201d said Bolsonaro, who is the regional representative of Steve Bannon\u2019s far-right group \u201cThe Movement\u201d. That was a reference to one of the most traumatic events in recent Brazilian history \u2013 December 1968\u2019s Institutional Act Number Five (AI-5) - when Brazil\u2019s military rulers moved to extinguish growing political unrest by indefinitely outlawing freedom of expression and assembly and closing congress. \u201cThe AI-5 was an instrument intended to intimidate people \u2026 It allowed the dictatorship to repress all opposition and dissent,\u201d the historians Lilia Schwarz and Heloisa M Starling wrote in their recent \u201cbiography\u201d of Brazil. As a new era of suppression began and dissidents fled into exile, one newspaper tried to skirt the censors with a now famous front page weather forecast that announced: \u201cStormy weather. Suffocating temperature. Air unbreathable. The country is being swept by strong winds.\u201d \u201cAI-5 was such a symbolic moment because it signalled the intensification of the military movement\u2019s authoritarianism,\u201d Schwarz said. In a country still grappling with the legacy of those grim days of authoritarian rule, Bolsonaro\u2019s provocation \u2013 for which he later offered a partial apology \u2013 sparked outrage, from left to right. \u201cDeclarations such as those of Eduardo Bolsonaro are repugnant,\u201d the speaker of Brazil\u2019s lower house, Rodrigo Maia, tweeted. \u201cThe AI-5 \u2026 suspended rights and introduced censorship: an authoritarian\u2019s dream. The dream of the [Bolsonaro] clan,\u201d tweeted Joice Hasselmann, a disaffected Bolsonaro ally. \u201cWe cannot allow this serious attack on democracy.\u201d Leftwing politicians vowed to seek the politician\u2019s removal from office. \u201cEduardo is a spoiled brat bawling his authoritarian desires \u2026 We will not stand for it,\u201d tweeted the progressive senator Randolfe Rodrigues, summoning Brazilians to a day of \u201canti-authoritarian\u201d protests next Tuesday. Schwarz called Bolsonaro\u2019s remarks a Trumpian bid to distract from compromising media reports that undermined the Bolsonaro family\u2019s \u201cmoral standing\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like Donald Trump\u2019s tendency: every time you feel a scandal drawing near \u2026 you do something to draw attention away from that matter and put it somewhere else,\u201d she said. Foreign observers were also aghast. \u201cI never thought I would \u2026 hear such nonsense out of Brazil,\u201d one veteran ambassador told the Brazilian journalist Jamil Chade. The controversy caps an anarchic week in Brazilian politics. In the early hours of Wednesday Brazil\u2019s president launched a furious tirade against the \u201cputrid\u201d press from a hotel room in Saudi Arabia. That outburst came after Brazil\u2019s top broadcaster revealed the investigation into the 2018 assassination of the leftist politician Marielle Franco suggested the suspects had met at Bolsonaro\u2019s compound before the attack."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
