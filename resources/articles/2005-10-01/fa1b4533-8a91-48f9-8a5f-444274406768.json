But never, ever, listen to them.\" That was a long time ago. Nowadays, traders are much respected by economists and mathematicians, if not for their individual insights into the workings of the economy, then certainly for their collective wisdom. And that wisdom is now being harnessed in a truly unexpected way - for the social good. Anyone who has ever traded a financial instrument knows how difficult it is to beat the collective stock of knowledge that is built into the price of a currency, share or bond. The efficient market hypothesis states that the current price always incorporates all the known information at the time, whether that knowledge comes in the form of economic data, chart patterns of previous price action, or anything else in the public domain. For those of us who earn a living by trying to outsmart the markets, that hypothesis has been annoyingly difficult to disprove. But market efficiency can be harnessed for much more than just making or losing money. Since the late 1980s, the University of Iowa has been running an electronic exchange that allows (mainly) academics to trade small sums of money on forthcoming presidential elections. On average, in the week before each election, the markets have predicted the candidates' share with an average error of 1.5 percentage points, compared with an error of 2.1 points in the final Gallup poll. Markets have now been shown to out-perform collections of \"experts\" in predicting monthly economic data better than the best economists, or in accurately forecasting whether WMD would be found in Iraq. Mathematicians believe that the existence of a market allows large numbers of people effectively to \"pool\" their collective wisdom, with each new trader able to bring a unique new insight into the mix. How can this power be harnessed for the social good? Iowa has recently been experimenting with the trading of \"flu predictions\", in which traders have been asked to forecast the state of flu alert that will be in place in the state several weeks in advance. Researchers have found that the flu prediction market has been able to predict the state of flu alert with 90% accuracy a fortnight ahead of time - long enough to allow medical staff to gear up prevention and treatment regimes. Iowa economists will next turn their attention to a market that will predict the number of bird flu cases in the US. It cannot come soon enough. Prediction markets, as they are now called, are cropping up in fields as diverse as the war on terror and Hollywood box-office receipts. The Pentagon, no less, wanted to open a market in future deaths from terrorism, believing this would enable them to be alert when the terror threat was particularly high. This was stopped by Congress because it was thought to be \"macabre\". Understandable, perhaps. But the opportunity to use the power of markets to save lives has nevertheless been lost."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
