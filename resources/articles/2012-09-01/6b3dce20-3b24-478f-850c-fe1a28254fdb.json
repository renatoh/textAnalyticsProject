This set features 10 covers, including Elvis Costello and Cait O'Riordan's Baby Plays Around, Jimi Hendrix's Hey Joe and Nick Drake's Time Has Told Me. Mehldau creates fascinating detours and slow-changing moods and motifs in his improvisations on Sufjan Stevens' Holland and Baby Plays Around. But he cuts dazzlingly loose on Clifford Brown's Brownie Speaks and Sonny Rollins's Airegin. Hey Joe could have been shorter, and the later tracks (with a growing Latin-jazz presence) have something of a business-as-usual feel. But the dynamics and empathy of this ensemble remain pretty irresistible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
