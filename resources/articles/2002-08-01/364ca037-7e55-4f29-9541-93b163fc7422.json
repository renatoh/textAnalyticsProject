I'm in agreement and am off home. Cheers for your emails, Sean. 6.10pm: Bad light stops play 12th over: India 62-2 Now Dravid comes in on the act, beefily hitting Harmison through the covers for four (the 150th boundary of the match, incidentally). Almost immediately the umpires offer bad light to the Indians who, not surprisingly, accept. Although play won't be called off until 7pm that might be it for the day, I reckon. 11th over: India 58-2 Tendulkar is on fire! He c-c-cracks three successive boundaries - although the final one, low through the covers, was slightly fortuitous. Despite the pounding (12 off the over), Hoggard has been bowling well - lots of nice away swing. 10th over: India 46-2 Not surprisingly, England have made a bowling change, Harmison comes in for Flintoff and bowls a nice, tidy maiden. Nineth over: India 46-2 It's rare to see Hoggard stray down legside but he does it twice in succession to Dravid. The result? A boundary then a single as India's batsmen continue their confident approach to a difficult position. Tendulkar is now on 24 from 28 balls, with Dravid 15 off 20. Eighth over: India 40-2 Flintoff is proving far looser than his bowling partner, Hoggard, and Tendulkar takes advantage. A punch through midwicket gets him a couple before a cracking square drive brings a boundary. A quick single follows before Dravid finishes an expensive over with a fine leg glance for four. Seventh over: India 29-2 Hoggard regains his accuracy - he's hitting an area just around off-stump steadily now - and although Tendulkar clearly wants to clout him he's unable to do so. Good over. Sixth over: India 28-2 Another over, another Tendulkar boundary, this time he chases after a widish Flintoff delivery and thrashes it for four. He's now on 15, with Dravid on 6. Fifth over: India 23-2 Another over, another Tendulkar boundary, this time through mid-off for four. Fourth over: India 18-2 Flintoff keeps up the pressure, until he slips in a widish one. Immediately Tendulkar is on to it, crashing a shot through the covers for four. Third over: India 13-2 Hoggard's straight and steady but Dravid is up to the challenge. India are still 247 runs behind though, so there's a long, long way to go. Second over: India 11-2 Another over, another England wicket! Flintoff raps Jaffer on the knee roll and, after some deliberation, umpire Triffin says it's out. The Hawkeye replay doesn't agree with him, however - it suggests the ball was going over the stumps. First over: India 7-1 Hoggard's first over and already India are a man down! Sehwag doesn't play a shot at a delivery that heading towards middle and off and umpire Koertzen has no choice: he's out! 5pm Bad light has stopped play. Over 144: England 617 all out England's innings has finally come to an end. Craig White ends on 94 not out after Harmison slices a drive to gully off the bowling of Agarkar. Over 143: England 616-9 Now that's a rare thing: a maiden over. Harmison is facing Nehra though, so it's not too much of a surprise. Over 143: England 616-9 White goes on the attack, smashing a top spinner off Harbhajan into the second tier of the stand for six and nearly adding another boundary two balls later. White's now on 93. Over 142: England 603-9 England bring up the 600! The last time they did that was against India at Lord's in 1990 when Graham Gooch hit 333 out of a score of 653-4. The clouds are darkening, the umpires have checked the light but play continues. Over 141: England 599-9 Harmison off the mark! He paddles a turner from Harbhajan around the corner for a couple before nearly edging a top spinner and, next ball, surviving a bat-pad appeal. Over 140: England 596-9 Finally India have broken the partnership! Hoggard edges Nehra, but despite wicketkeeper Patel going for it then dropping back, Dravid at first slip is able to take the catch. Hoggard is out for 32 off 102 balls in 109 minutes. Over 139: England 596-8 That's more like it! Ten runs off the over as England push again. Incidentally, Hoggard and White's ninth wicket partnership is a record for any England v India Test match - beating the 83 by Fletcher and Gifford at Chennai in 1972/73. Over 138: England 586-8 It's all gone a bit quiet at the moment. The big question, of course, is when will England declare. Perhaps at tea, which is being taken later than usual, much to my stomach's chagrin. Over 137: England 583-8 Ganguly tries his medium-pacers but White just swats them aside, taking seven more off the over to take England 227 ahead. Over 136: England 576-8 Hoggard picks up another couple with a drive behind square to move onto 27. White looks in control on 6. Over 134 and 135: England 573-8 Another computer crash. Apologies. England's rate rate has dipped before tea and the spectators are doing a Mexican wave. Cue lots of boozy cheers and boos. Over 133: England 570-8 England march slowly towards 600. You can't blame them for not declaring yet - they're scoring at 4.3 an over, the pitch looks fairly harmless and the Indian's are dispirited. They're 214 ahead at the moment and with 54 possible overs left to play today there's still a lot of cricket left to be played in this Test match. Over 132: England 569-8 Hoggard hits another smooth cover drive to move onto 25, his highest ever first class score. He deserves it too - he's batted very well. Over 130 and 131: England 564-8 Another computer crash, but don't worry, you haven't missed much. White is now on 61 while Hoggard has moved onto 21. India's bowling is still powder-puff. Over 129: England 554-8 It says something about the ineffectiveness of the Indian attack that Matthew Hoggard is now looking completely confident at the crease. Three more off Zaheer Khan takes him to 16, with White on 60. Over 128: England 550-8 Sehwag comes on to try his cheeky off-spinners, but Craig White is in full control at the moment and a full-blooded boundary and a clever sweep shot take England to 550. Over 127:England 544-8 White gets a deserved half-century, and moves onto 54 when VVS Laxman somehow lets one slip through his fingers for a boundary. It somes up India's day. Overs 125 and 126: England 540-8 Sorry, more computer problems. Since I was last with you Craig White has moved onto 49 and Matthew Hoggard onto 13. England are 183 ahead, which certainly gives them a chance of winning this match. India, meanwhile, look desolate. Over 124: England 532-8 After being bullied by White for another boundary, Harbhajan at last finds from sharp turn - taking it from outside off to leg. But a bit of extra bounce takes it over leg stump, much to White's relief. Drinks. Over 123: England 525-8 Khan's back on for a frustrated Agarkar, but both White and even Hoggard are handling him comfortably. White punches a wide half volley through the offside to move onto 43. Over 122: England 519-8 Harbhajan tries to give it more air, but once again White is equal to it. He's now on 38, with Hoggard on 4. England now lead by 162. Over 121: England 516-8 It's Hoggard v Agarkar again. The Indian tries everything to dismiss Hoggard - short, round the wicket, you name it - but once again comes off worse after conceding another four byes after straying down leg-side again. Over 120: England 512-8 Craig White is handling Harbhajan superbly and cuts him away through covers for four on the last ball of the over to move onto 37. Over 119: England 506-8 Hoggard can't get anywhere near Agarkar, who clearly is scenting blood. However on the fifth ball of the over, Agarkar overdoes it and fires a fierce one down the leg side, conceding four byes. Over 118: England 502-8 Harbhajan has rediscovered his just-outside-off-stump, and some accurate bowling has White dabbling and missing. He'd like to get a single off the last over to regain the strike but is unable to do so. Over 117: England 500-8 White takes a single off Agarkar's first over to bring up the 500. Hoggard then sees out the over, although he's fortunate not to edge a superb outswinger that beats him all ends up. Over 116: England 499-8 Another good over for England - White plays Harbhajan superbly and moves onto 32, while Hoggard gets off the mark too. Over 115: England 494-8 White takes the single offered by the Indian field early, but Hoggard proves capable of defending the last three balls in Agarkar's over. Over 114: England 493-8 Sorry for the delay, computer problems which come, typically, just as England lose their eighth wicket. Cork prods one down off Harbhajan and Jaffer takes a brilliant catch up close. Cork goes for 31! Over 113: England 492-7 Another bowling change sees Agarkar on at the Radcliffe Road End. Unlike earlier in the day he doesn't produce much movement. Over 112: England 489-7 Harbhajan returns from the Pavillion End. White adds three more as England head steadily but surely towards 500. Over 111: England 486-7 If ever a team looked dispirited on the field it's this Indian side. White and Cork share a boundary each to take them onto 29 and 22 respectively and bring up the 50 partnership. Over 110: England 477-7 Dominic Cork may be batting on one leg but so far it's not affecting his batting - another boundary over the covers off Agarkar takes him to 25. Over 109: England 472-7 The first runs of the afternoon! Zaheer bowls it widish and Cork stands up tall and times it exquisitely through the covers for four. Over 108: England 468-7 OK, we're back. Agarkar from the Pavillion End gets the first maiden of the day. Bob Cushion says: \"I'm feeling a bit deprived, what's the use of an English summer if you can't moan about another abject batting collapse whenever they lose a quick wicket or two? Credit where it's due though, I don't ever recall them batting so well and so consistently.\" Agree completely about the batting Bob - England have looked a lot more solid this year (though facing Sri Lanka and India certainly helps). However, there's no need to feel deprived. Just concentrate your fury on another target - like this dismal English summer/ lack of quality TV (it's as good as it used to be or Ulrika Jonsson. Over 107: England 468-7 More runs. Lunch arrives with White on 16, Cork on 17 and England 111 runs ahead. See you again at 1.40pm. Over 106: England 462-7 Harbhajan comes on for Nehra and starts steadily. Are we about to get our first maiden of the day? In a word, no: White expertly cuts Harbhajan's last ball for four. England now lead by 109 runs. Over 105: England 462-7 After a couple of loose overs, Kahn finds his line and length. England, who have so far scored 121 this morning, can only manage a single. Still they won't complain about their morning's work. Over 104: England 461-7 Another over, another boundary: Nehra strays outside the off-stump and Cork crashes a cover drive for four. That's the 22nd boundary of the day. Over 103: Eng;and 456-7 Now White gets in on the act, taking eight off Khan's over to move to 11. Over 102: England 448-7 For five deliveries it's a quiet over - White nudging a single, Cork playing defensive and straight - but then Cork lofts a lovely shot over Nehra for four. He's now on 12, with White on 3. Over 101: England 443-7 It hasn't taken Cork long to get his sights set - he's just thrashed Khan for two fours in an over. Over 100: England 435-7 The new batsmen, Cork and White are understandably more cautious and it's a fairly quiet over. Ros from London takes advantage of the lull to explain why her object of teen affection was Mike Atherton. \"Well, put it this way,\" she says. \"Which sounds better? Joining thousands of screaming young females at a Bros concert and throwing your knickers at robotic Luke Goss, or spending a happy Sunday at Old Trafford catching Mike's eye from a strategic position on the boundary and putting away a few kilos of strawberries? Once I was even able to retrieve a ball for him during a long innings by a Surrey opener.\" I can empathise to a certain extent Ros - I remember the joy of getting Arnie Sidebottom's autograph when Yorkshire played Northants at Wardown Park, Luton - but surely you could have picked a more dashing player than Athers? Graham Gooch, perhaps? Over 99: England 433-7 You know what they say about London buses. You wait for one to come along and... Well, India know that feeling. Incredibly, after a morning without any success whatsoever, Zaheer Khan's just taken the wickets of BOTH Flintoff and Stewart. Flintoff went first for 33, beaten for pace by a delivery that shoots low and is bowled. Then, after Craig White got off the mark with a single, Stewart was bowled by one that cut back for 87. And Dominic Cork has just survived an lbw appeal too! The Indians are bouncing around like a boxer that's had a double dose of smelling salts. And no wonder - they are right back in this match! Over 98: England 432-5 Nehra steams in and nearly gets the breakthrough on his second ball. Stewart, who's rode his luck today, gets an inside edge which zips past the slip cordon for four. Two balls later and this time there's no luck involved - Stewart cracks a superb boundary for four to move to 87. Over 97: England 422-5 Flintoff's on fire! He smashes Agarkar twice through the covers to move onto 33 from 43 balls. Incidentally, they've scored 81 runs off 14 overs today - a run rate of well over 5.50 an over. Over 96: England 411-5 Flintoff is on fire. He rocks back and pulls Kahn through the covers for four. We've got a drinks break now. One hour down, another seven and half to go. \"I'm reading this from an overheated office in London,\" says Ros from London. \"Quick question. What is my teenage hero Mike Atherton up to now? And is it true he is in constant pain from his back?\" Your teenage hero is commentating on Channel 4, Ros - and yes, he is still in pain from his bad back. Incidentally, Atherton is a strange choice for teenage affection, Ros - why not Luke Goss or Joey from New Kids On The Block like everyone else? Over 95: England 405-5 A few overs ago, Agarkar had Stewart in lots of trouble. But you wouldn't know it at the moment. The Indian bowler has lost his line and Stewart enjoys successive boundaries as England race past 400. Every man and his dog reckoned this Test match would be a draw after two days, but if England keep this up they could yet etch out a win. Over 94: England 397-5 A quieter over but Stewart keeps the score ticking over nicely. England are now 40 runs ahead. Over 93: England 391-5 Agarkar, who's been India's best bowler this morning, produces some more late movement and Stewart edges it between wicketkeeper and first slip. Patel goes for it but then stops, Dravid at first slip barely moves and the ball shoots between them for four. The upshot? Lots of glances between the Indian team, while Stewart gets his 50. Two further boundaries takes him to 60 - and poor Agarkar has conceded 12 off the over! Over 92: England 379-5 Zaheer Khan replaces Harbhajan, but his first ball is a half-volley that is more juicy than a cup full of squeezed oranges. Boundary to Flintoff! Two balls later, Zaheer is loose again and Flintoff gets another four. He's now on 20, with Stewart on 49. Over 91: England 371-5 India take the new ball and immediately it pays dividends as Stewart edges to Ganguly at second slip. Or did he? Stewart refuses to walk and after lots of replays it seems that the ball hit the ground first. The third umpire's decision? Not out! Over 90: England 369-5 Another expensive over for India as Stewart takes advantage of a Harbhajan long-hop to score another boundary and move onto 46. Over 89: England 363-5 After a steady over - a hint of swing, though not much extra bounce - Agarkar strays down the leg side on his final ball and Stewart smashes it for a boundary. He's on 41 now and looking good for his half-century. Over 88: England 358-5 Stewart, who's been very restrained so far, pulls Harbhajan for a boundary then gets another couple with a well-timed prod through the covers. Over 87: England 352-5 Agarkar keeps it tight, but without the prodigious swing or bounce we saw in his first over. Ganguly has set a very defensive field. Stewart is on 31, Flintoff on 10. Over 86: England 350-5 A change in the bowling as Harbhajan replaces Nehru. He starts pretty well - he's giving the ball lots of air, but Flintoff is able to keep the scoreboard ticking over with a couple of well-placed shots. Over 85: England 347-5 Great over from Agarkar, who gets his line right and some decent swing from the off. From his second delivery Flintoff, eager to keep the score ticking over, goes fishing outside off-stump - but Agarkar produces some extra bounce and a good deal of swing and very nearly takes the edge. Over 84: England 346-5 A decent start for England - Flintoff cracks a boundary and takes a single off Nehra's fairly innocous bowling. Pre-amble It's slightly cloudly at Nottingham but don't worry: there's no spitting rain or swirling wind around so we'll be starting on time. And, to make up for rain on days one and two, we'll be playing a minimum 105 overs today. That's great news for everyone at Trent Bridge of course, but less good for my verge-of-RSI-fingers. Will they'll be able to cope?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
