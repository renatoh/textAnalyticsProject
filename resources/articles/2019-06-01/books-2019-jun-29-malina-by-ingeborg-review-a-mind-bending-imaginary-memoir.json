And with mind-bending novels such as this around, who could argue? Bachmann described it as an \u201cimaginary autobiography\u201d and, like her, the narrator is a middle-aged writer living in Vienna. Around those basic facts is constructed a startling edifice of psychological intensity, centred on the men in her life. Her lover is Ivan, for whom she shows a dedication less romantic than pathological: \u201cEven if Ivan was created just for me, as he certainly was, I can never claim him solely for myself. For he has come to make consonants constant once again and comprehensible, to unlock vowels to their full resounding \u2026 \u201d She worships Ivan \u201cfor retrieving me from underneath all the rubble\u201d, even though he insults her in staccato, cut-off conversations (\u201cGray and brown clothes make you old\u201d). She doesn\u2019t communicate with him, but chops up her narrative with fairytales and imagined interviews, confiding in the reader. And why, we wonder, doesn\u2019t Ivan seem interested in Malina, the person she lives with? Malina is a mystery, defined only by the impact he has on our narrator. Is he a man, Malina, or a woman, Lina? Is he real, or an aspect of the narrator? (\u201cI don\u2019t want to lead Ivan astray, but he will never realise that I am double. I am also Malina\u2019s creation.\u201d) Nothing is really certain; even her passport has her profession \u201ccrossed out twice and written over\u201d. Malina embodies the equanimity the narrator cannot achieve in her own mind and body. This originates in childhood with her father, who represents Austria\u2019s struggle to come to terms with its Nazi past. Her father\u2019s abusive atrocities tear the book down the middle (\u201cI am fired to death in the kiln of my father\u2019s frenzy\u201d) and run through its second half. Amid all the talking (and much smoking of cigarettes), there is a plot, which sends Malina, Ivan and the narrator to a destructive conclusion. Malina\u2019s long sentences hold the reader close, and the novel\u2019s white-hot emotions make it an addictive read. Bachmann\u2019s vision is so original that the effect is like having a new letter of the alphabet. Malina was intended as the first part of a trilogy; Bachmann\u2019s death in 1973 from injuries sustained in a house fire, before she could complete it, is a loss to literature. \u2022 Malina, translated by Philip Boehm, is published by Penguin Modern Classics (RRP \u00a39.99).
