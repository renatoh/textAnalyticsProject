It was his ex-wife. Something was wrong. She rarely called when she knew he was behind the wheel. \u201cShe said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to tell you something. I\u2019ve got a news alert on my email that said the ABC offices have been raided over the Afghan Files,\u2019\u201d McBride says. \u201cWe both kind of nervously laughed, and she said, \u2018I\u2019ll speak to you later.\u2019\u201d As McBride continued the long drive home from Sydney to Canberra, federal police were busy sifting through sensitive documents at the ABC\u2019s Sydney headquarters. They had the power to add, copy, delete or alter anything relevant to the 2017 Afghan files expos\u00e9 on special forces misconduct in the Afghanistan war. The warrant listed McBride as the police\u2019s first subject of interest. McBride unleashed powerful forces when he decided to go public years ago with what he discovered as a military lawyer serving in Afghanistan. Those forces have already exacted a crippling toll. \u201c[My ex-wife] would probably say \u2013 and I think there\u2019s an element of truth in it \u2013 it killed David McBride,\u201d he says. \u201cThe man that she married was killed by the defence force, and I\u2019m someone who\u2019s different. \u201cDoing something like this, taking on the whole government, it sends shockwaves through your life, and not much survives, really.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s raid on the ABC prompted outrage among civil rights groups, transparency campaigners, journalists and unions. It came just a day after federal police searched the home of the News Corp reporter Annika Smethurst, searching for documents related to her coverage of proposed new surveillance powers for the Australian Signals Directorate. 2GB host Ben Fordham\u2019s revelation about asylum seeker boats attempting to reach Australia from Sri Lanka is also the subject of a home affairs investigation, as the department attempts to identify his source. The raids have not occurred in isolation. Multiple whistleblowers who revealed government wrongdoing are currently being pursued through the courts with alarming vigour. The government is prosecuting Witness K and Bernard Collaery, who revealed an unlawful spy operation against Timor-Leste during oil negotiations. Richard Boyle, the tax office worker who revealed the government\u2019s heavy-handed approach to recovering debts, faces a long stint in jail if convicted. Assoc Prof Joseph Fernandez, a journalism lecturer at Curtin University, has spent years studying source protection and the Australian media. He says the consequences of this week\u2019s raids are clear, regardless of whether journalists are charged. \u201cSuch raids, regardless of what happens here to journalists or to others, will have an immeasurable censoring effect on contact people have with journalists,\u201d Fernandez says. \u201cIn my research in this area over the years, it was clear that even senior public servants are apprehensive about having contact with journalists, even about mundane things, in the wake of laws that enable the authorities to track down sources.\u201d The McBride matter had been bubbling away for some time before Wednesday\u2019s raid. Guardian Australia understands police have been talking to the ABC since at least September, trying to find a way to access the documents without resorting to a very public raid. The ABC did not hand over the documents. The AFP also maintains there was no notification to the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, before the raids. He was alerted only after they took place, the AFP says. But critics have raised suspicions about the proximity of the raids to the federal election and the time that has passed since the original publications. Prof John Blaxland, a former army officer now with the Australian National University\u2019s Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, says the optics suggest overreach. \u201cMultiple raids in the one week, so shortly after the election outcome and without a compelling explanation, leave us wondering as to whether this is something that has been pending for some time, something that those authorising them knew would generate controversy that was best left until early in a new term of office, when the political fallout could be contained,\u201d Blaxland says. It\u2019s a suggestion the AFP has flatly denied. The AFP\u2019s acting commissioner, Neil Gaughan, said on Thursday such investigations were complex, lengthy, and driven by nothing other than operational and evidential considerations. The election played no role in their timing, and the AFP was not attempting to intimidate journalists, he said. \u201cAny inference that suggests our decisions were influenced by anybody outside the organisation is strongly refuted,\u201d Gaughan said. The police union, for its part, urged the public to remember officers were just doing their job, following the law as it exists. Police were acting on referrals made to them by the defence department. \u201cI understand that there is intense media reporting in relation to these warrants and I am proud of the way AFP members have professionally executed their duties during this trying time,\u201d the federal police union boss, Angela Smith, told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe members involved are doing their job and doing it professionally.\u201d Denis Muller, from the University of Melbourne\u2019s Centre for Advancing Journalism, says arguments about the police operating at arm\u2019s length from government miss the point. \u201cThe point is that the politicians have constructed a repressive legal regime designed to protect the executive branch of government, impede accountability to the public and exert a chilling effect on the press,\u201d Muller wrote in the Conversation. Police were acting under old laws when they raided Smethurst and the ABC. The AFP said it was acting under \u201csecrecy offences in Part 6 and 7 of the Crimes Act 1914\u201d. Those laws bar public servants from unauthorised disclosures, and prohibit the publication of official secrets. In recent years, the powers available to the government have increased dramatically. In 2015, both major parties helped usher in metadata retention laws, which prompted huge concern for the anonymity of journalists\u2019 sources. Metadata \u2013 details about a particular communication, rather than the content of the communication itself \u2013 now must be retained by telecommunications companies for two years. A vast number of government agencies are allowed warrantless access to the metadata. Late last year, the Communications Alliance said its members had received requests from at least 80 different government agencies. Police are required to obtain a warrant to access a journalists\u2019 metadata and say the need to access a reporter\u2019s details is \u201cextremely rare\u201d. They admitted in 2017 that they had failed to get a warrant in one such case. Further laws were enacted last year allowing the government to compel technology companies to assist in decrypting private communications. The new powers again threatened a key avenue of communication between whistleblowers and journalists \u2013 encrypted messaging applications. Labor\u2019s Mark Dreyfus has raised concerns about the raids, questioning why they have taken so long, and expressing doubt that government ministers were not aware of the operation. He has suggested a Senate inquiry may be needed. \u201cThe government is responsible for this,\u201d Dreyfus told the ABC. \u201cThese are government documents, this is government information, the government referred this to the Australian Federal Police.\u201d Blaxland believes a \u201crobust examination\u201d of Australia\u2019s intelligence and national security regime is now needed, to take stock of the current laws and to better address serious risks posed by attacks such as the one revealed this week that targeted the Australian National University. \u201cWe know much legislation has been approved concerning these domains in recent times and it is time for a holistic review,\u201d Blaxland says. \u201cIssues that should be addressed range from the industrial-scale hacking of national institutions \u2026 the largely unexplained aggregation of powers in the home affairs portfolio and the related discomfort evident within associated security and intelligence agencies. \u201cI advocate this not out of some conspiratorial obsession, but because I sense the need to clear the air, to assure the public of what is going on and, where practices are suboptimal or excessive, to ensure recommendations are made and enacted upon to see that they are modified.\u201d Tensions between national security and a free press are not unique to Australia. The United Nations enshrines the right to access information and protections for sources and whistleblowers through the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Australia has ratified. Yet a 2015 UN study into source protections, the first of its kind, found governments across the world were failing to ensure \u201cadequate protections to whistleblowers and sources of information\u201d. Clashes between the need for secrecy and the public\u2019s right to know were common, the report found. But where such difficulties emerged, the UN said governments should always avoid enacting laws that restrict free speech. \u201cWhen the right and the restriction clash, as they are often purported to do, governments and international organisations should not adopt laws and policies that default in favour of the restrictions,\u201d the UN\u2019s special rapporteur found. Australia\u2019s whistleblower protections \u2013 chiefly available through the Public Interest Disclosure Act \u2013 face frequent criticism for their weaknesses. Government whistleblowers must take extreme care to raise concerns internally and with external watchdog agencies before they can go public. Even then, whistleblowers are able to obtain protection for disclosures to the media only in limited circumstances. It\u2019s a common theme among whistleblowers who have been prosecuted. The ATO whistleblower, Boyle, raised his concerns internally through the PID Act before going public. He now faces a maximum 161-year sentence. Witness K went to the inspector-general of intelligence and security to raise concerns and seek approval to talk to Collaery, an approved lawyer for the intelligence services. McBride similarly made internal complaints, sought protection, and went to the police. The leak has already caused him to spend one night in detention, and he faces a long stint in jail if he loses his case. Despite all the pain it has caused him, McBride says he would take the same course if he had his time again. \u201cMy lifelong friends kind of laugh at the irony of me being a whistleblower, because it\u2019s not what anyone would have expected of me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when you\u2019re confronted with behaviour which is so bad, you don\u2019t really have a choice, whether you\u2019re a goody two-shoes or not.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
