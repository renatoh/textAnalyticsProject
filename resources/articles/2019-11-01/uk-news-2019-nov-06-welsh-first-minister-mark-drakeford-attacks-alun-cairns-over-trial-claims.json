Mark Drakeford accused Cairns of being arrogant and out of touch and criticised him for not coming forward to explain the circumstances of a case that is threatening to overshadow the Welsh Conservatives\u2019 campaign. Last week, the Welsh Conservatives claimed Cairns was unaware of his former aide Ross England\u2019s role in the rape trial before it became public a few days before. On Tuesday, BBC Wales published an email it said was sent to Cairns by his special adviser, Geraint Davies, more than a year earlier, in which Davies wrote: \u201cI have spoken to Ross and he is confident no action will be taken by the court.\u201d The email was sent on 2 August 2018, the BBC reported. Four months later, England was selected as the Welsh Conservatives\u2019 candidate for the Vale of Glamorgan for the 2021 Welsh assembly election. He was later suspended after being accused by a judge of deliberately sabotaging the rape trial. The rape victim is among those who have called for Cairns to resign. Drakeford said Cairns\u2019 position was another example of the Conservative party\u2019s arrogance to go alongside remarks by Jacob Rees-Moggs about the Grenfell fire and comments from a Tory candidate in Gower, south Wales, suggesting that people on the reality TV show Benefits Street needed \u201cputting down\u201d. The first minister and Welsh Labour leader told BBC Radio Wales on Wednesday: \u201cThe Tory party is an arrogant party. Mr Cairn\u2019s predicament is an example of the wider arrogant and out of touch nature of the Conservative party. You saw it with Jacob Rees-Mogg, you saw it with their candidate in the Gower. \u201cTo believe that you can say one thing and then to be found out that what you said wasn\u2019t true. To believe that when you are found out you don\u2019t have to respond to it at all. The Tory party is out of touch with people. Mr Cairn\u2019s predicament I think is just an illustration of that.\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow secretary for Wales, Christina Rees, said Cairns had been caught \u201cbrazenly lying\u201d. She said on Wednesday: \u201cWe are being asked to believe that Alun Cairns\u2019 special adviser knew about Ross England collapsing a rape trial, that the same adviser emailed details to Alun Cairns \u2013 and still, Alun Cairns didn\u2019t know anything of it. It\u2019s patently, palpably absurd. \u201cWorse still, he has refused to comment since these latest revelations have surfaced \u2013 even as the victim from the original trial calls on him to go.\u201d Plaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, wrote to Boris Johnson saying: \u201cThe revelation that Alun Cairns knew about Ross England\u2019s role in this case before endorsing him as a candidate shows that Mr Cairns is unfit to hold public office. \u201cAt worst, Mr Cairns is complicit in the attempted cover-up of his former staff member\u2019s actions which collapsed a rape trial. At best, he has displayed gross incompetence in judgment, dishonesty and a lack of leadership.\u201d Privately, there is growing concern among Welsh Conservatives at Cairns\u2019 silence. A spokeswoman for the Welsh Conservatives said: \u201cThere is no new information from this leaked document confirming an informal conversation which took place a considerable time after the trial collapsed and is consistent with statements made. \u201cThe full details of this case are still not known and we have taken action in writing to the court. All forthcoming information will be taken into account as the party conducts a thorough investigation.\u201d After England made claims about the victim\u2019s sexual history while giving evidence during the rape trial, the judge, Stephen Hopkins, told England: \u201cYou have managed, singlehandedly, and I have no doubt it was deliberate on your part, to sabotage this trial. \u201cMr England, as far as I am concerned, this matter so far as you are concerned isn\u2019t ended. I shall be writing personal letters to people who are politically close to you and I hope they take appropriate action. Get out of my court.\u201d The defendant, James Hackett, was later convicted of rape at a retrial."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
