The biggie was Call of Duty: Finest Hour, the console edition of the WW2 classic series. Steve Boxer was wowed enough to award four stars. \"Technically, Finest Hour is the most impressive second world war console game\", he said. This is slightly less of a complement when you consider its competitors include the shocking Medal of Honor: Rising Sun, but worthy praise all the same. On a totally different tack is The Moment of Silence, an adventure game for PC. This much-maligned genre still has something to offer those gamers who fancy using their brain rather than reflexes. \"Gaming should be about adventures, and where would adventure games be without a good story?\" asks Rhianna Pratchett in her three-star review. Last up is my review of Killzone, the much-hyped, but ultimately disappointing first-person shooter for PS2. I had high hopes for this, but was badly let down by the whole experience. Maybe I was a little harsh giving it only one star, but two would be the max here. Anyone else disappointed by Killzone?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
