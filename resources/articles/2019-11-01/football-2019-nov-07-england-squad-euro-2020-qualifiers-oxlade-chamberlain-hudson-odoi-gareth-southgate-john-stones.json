The Leicester midfielder was pictured in a casino at the same time as England were losing to the Czech Republic last month after withdrawing from the squad owing to illness but has been a driving force behind his club\u2019s strong start to the season. Maddison was first selected for last year\u2019s Nations League matches against Croatia and Spain before being recalled last month but has still to make an appearance. Southgate said he had not spoken to the 22-year-old since he was pictured at the casino and said it is now up to Maddison to show his ability on the pitch. \u201cIt would be dangerous territory for me to go on a moral crusade over something I don\u2019t think was a good decision but was in his own time and we had released him from the squad,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think this was one to hinder him in terms of selection but it\u2019s not a good situation for a player when we\u2019re talking about him in Sofia [before England\u2019s qualifier against Bulgaria], and talking about him here and he\u2019s yet to get on the pitch for us. \u201cSo that\u2019s the challenge. You want to be high-performance, low-maintenance. I am prepared to work with players who are more difficult but you\u2019re more likely to back those players if they\u2019ve scored a winner for you and sweated blood for you, and that\u2019s the bond you build with those players over a longer period of time.\u201d Maddison\u2019s inclusion in a bloated 27-man squad for the matches against Montenegro and Kosovo that also features recalls for John Stones, in place of Michael Keane, plus Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Callum Hudson\u2011Odoi is an indication of how highly rated he is by Southgate. With no place for Dele Alli and injury concerns over Chelsea\u2019s Mason Mount and Ross Barkley, who started the matches against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria respectively, it could be a fight between Oxlade-Chamberlain and Maddison to fill one of England\u2019s three midfield roles. Asked if this represented a last chance for Maddison, Southgate said: \u201cI would imagine he\u2019s got that. He probably didn\u2019t realise what the consequences of going out might be and he\u2019s not been with an England team before. He wouldn\u2019t, perhaps, have picked up the responsibility that goes with that. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s aware of that now. \u201cThe important thing is we\u2019ve not viewed him differently because we\u2019ve picked him and he\u2019s in the mix with all of those other good players we\u2019ve talked about to try to get in the team. So, it\u2019s on to the football.\u201d The surprise 2-1 defeat in Prague scuppered hopes of sealing early qualification for Euro 2020 but victory over Montenegro at Wembley on Thursday in what will be England\u2019s 1,000th international would put that right. Southgate said the racist incidents that marred the 6-0 win over Bulgaria had overshadowed an impressive attacking display \u2013 albeit against poor opponents \u2013 but he believes there is still plenty of room to improve despite an impressive qualifying record with 26 goals in six matches. \u201cWe didn\u2019t create a huge amount of chances in Prague but goals per game, we\u2019re the top scorers in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are only Belgium and Russia who\u2019ve scored more and they\u2019ve both played two games more than us. So that area of the field doesn\u2019t concern me. I know there is this thirst for this creative player but we\u2019ve scored more than anybody else. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re still seeking that pivot who can do all sides of the game. If any of you see him by all means throw your hat at him. \u201cThere are areas of the pitch that we need to progress but our attacking play and the patterns \u2026 the game in Bulgaria was a great example of what we are capable of doing to teams with the movement, with the speed with the quality on the ball that we have in those areas of the pitch.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
