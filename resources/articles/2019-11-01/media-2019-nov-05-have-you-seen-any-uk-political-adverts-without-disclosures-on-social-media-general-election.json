Ahead of the UK general election we would like you to help us collect examples of political adverts running on social media which do not mention who has sponsored them. Political adverts on Facebook should clearly state who has paid for them in their posts. However, commercial adverts do not say who they are \u201cpaid for by\u201d but only show that they are sponsored. If you have seen any political content on social media that does not clearly state who has paid for it we would like to hear from you. Share your photos If you see an advert that does not say \u201cpaid for by\u201d screenshot it. Then, click on the three dots next to the advert, select \u201cwhy am I seeing this ad?\u201d and screenshot that information as well. Which platform did you see it on? Which political party was it for? If it did not have a disclosure on it what was the reason the platform gave for showing you the advert? Though adverts will be banned from Twitter on 22 November, we would be interested to know if you see any posted after this date. Tell us about your experiences in the encrypted form below.
