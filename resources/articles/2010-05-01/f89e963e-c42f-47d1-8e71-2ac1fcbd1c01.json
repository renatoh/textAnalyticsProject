The idea comes ahead of child poverty statistics to be published. Radical reforms of the benefits system are to be announced next Monday and the universal child benefit has been identified as an area ripe for cuts. Instead of an across-the-board cut or means-testing, the IPPR proposes increasing the benefit from \u00a320.30 a week for the eldest child and \u00a313.40 for subsequent children to a flat rate of \u00a322. Most of the extra cost would be recouped by taxing payments to families on middle and higher incomes. The IPPR says this could lift 350,000 children out of poverty. There were about 2.9 million living in poverty in 2007-08. Carey Oppenheim, co-director of the thinktank, said: \"The value of child benefit can be reduced for those on middle and higher incomes, but using some of the savings to boost the incomes of the poorest families could help to tackle our shameful levels of child poverty.\" The IPPR argues that this approach is better than means-testing, which tends to lead to lower take-up rates because of complicated application forms. The government spends around \u00a311.7bn a year on child benefit, which has a 98% take-up. The IPPR's proposals would increase the cost by \u00a3700m. For families on more than \u00a337,400, the weekly benefit would be taxed at 40%, making it worth \u00a313.20 per child."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
