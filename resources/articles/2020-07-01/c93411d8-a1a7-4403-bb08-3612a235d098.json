Arsenal will contest their 12th game in 39 days when they conclude their Premier League campaign against Watford on Sunday and will do so without a number of players. They include Shkodran Mustafi, who hurt a hamstring in the FA Cup semi-final win against Manchester City and will miss next Saturday\u2019s final, and Arteta believes the schedule has played a significant part in the absentee list. \u201cMustafi\u2019s injury is related to it because we had to expose our players and we had some really bad injuries in the last few weeks where we lost big, big players: our goalkeeper [Bernd Leno], central defenders and [Gabriel] Martinelli, central midfielders\u2026 \u201cBut it is what it is. It\u2019s unprecedented times with Covid, we knew the challenge. It\u2019s our responsibility to put a plan together where we don\u2019t expose them as much but sometimes it\u2019s inevitable, because when you don\u2019t have the numbers they have to keep playing.\u201d A scarcity of creative resources has also hampered Arteta, although that is largely down to the squad\u2019s lack of balance. Arsenal are 16th in the table of chances created in the top flight \u2013 one behind the relegation-threatened Watford \u2013 and he knows a vast improvement is required. \u201cThey don\u2019t lie, those stats,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you relate that to Arsenal it\u2019s not good enough and there are certain aspects of the games we don\u2019t control as well as we should. \u201cAt the same time, when you are in a process where you need immediate results \u2026 for the short-term objectives, you have to find a way to do it. You cannot just shoot yourself in the foot by doing something at certain moments that you are not able to do. We are trying to find this way but the next step in our evolution has to be very much linked to that, to improve that area a lot.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
