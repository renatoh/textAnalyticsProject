But exactly what the twist is, it's better to discover for yourself. Let's just say it gives the horror formula an exhilarating jolt without destroying it, in a Lost-meets-Scooby-Doo sort of way \u2013 a meta-mystery tour signposted with spoiler alerts. Battleship (12A) (Peter Berg, 2012, US) Taylor Kitsch, Liam Neeson, Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, Rihanna. 131 mins After the triumph of Transformers, Hasbro spin off another of their products, resulting in an effects-driven alien invasion that looks a lot like, er, Transformers. Expect Michael Bay-scale destruction, lots of CG explosions and military heroism, with extra cheese. A Night To Remember (PG) (Roy Ward Baker, 1958, UK) Kenneth More, Robert Ayres. 123 mins Restored version of the definitive pre-Cameron account of the Titanic's sinking. It's really much more of a documentary than a disaster movie \u2013 sticking to the facts, playing up class tensions and reining in emotional excesses. Mozart's Sister (12A) (Ren\u00e9 F\u00e9ret, 2010, Fra) Marie F\u00e9ret, Marc Barb\u00e9, Delphine Chuillot. 120 mins Wolfgang's literally unsung elder sister gets her story told, and it's a tale deserving of costumery, lush orchestral scoring and feminist rehabilitation. It's evocative of the era, but dramatically underpowered. Delicacy (12A) (David &amp; St\u00e9phane Foenkinos, 2011, Fra) Audrey Tautou, Fran\u00e7ois Damiens, Bruno Todeschini. 109 mins Can young widow Tautou learn to love again? Do bears prefer indoor toilets? Except she falls for the balding office klutz who everyone thinks is way out of her league \u2013 which just makes it even cutesier. Edge (15) (Carol Morley, 2010, UK) Maxine Peake, Joe Dempsie, Nichola Burley. 92 mins Dusted down after the success of her acclaimed doc/drama Dreams Of A Life, this earlier fictional effort of Morley's brings together a group of disparate loners in a cliff-edge hotel at a notorious suicide spot. It's subdued but poetic, in a slightly self-conscious way. Blackthorn (18) (Mateo Gil, 2011, Spa/US/Bol/Fra) Sam Shepard, Eduardo Noriega, Stephen Rea. 108 mins Shepard has all the grizzled stature it takes to portray Butch Cassidy in his sunset years, embarking on one last Bolivian adventure with an escaped Spanish robber (Noriega). Sturdy, traditional storytelling and the striking landscapes are just about enough. The Gospel Of Us (12A) (Dave McKean, 2012, UK) Michael Sheen, John-Paul Macleod, Matthew Aubrey. 145 mins Filmed version of Sheen's remarkable modern-day passion play, scripted by Owen Sheers and utilising the locations and population of Port Talbot. Mel Gibson it ain't. Out from Friday Breathing An Austrian delinquent learns about life and death. Marley Documentary on the king of reggae. Salmon Fishing In The Yemen Ewan McGregor befriends the Arabs and lands Emily Blunt. Elles Juliette Binoche in a tale of student sexual exploitation. Gone Amanda Seyfried tracks her abducted sister. Lockout Guy Pearce on a rescue mission in space. Beauty South African study of repressed homosexual desire. The Divide Nuclear survivors fall out in their fallout shelter. Fury Toronto-set thriller starring Samuel L Jackson. Vicky Donor Bollywood fertility comedy. Elfie Hopkins Amateur sleuth Jaime Winstone uncovers gory secrets. Grave Encounters Found-footage horror set in an abandoned hospital. Hollywoo French cross-cultural comedy. Town Of Runners The roots of Ethiopia's long-distance sporting success. Transit A family camping trip turns into a game of survival. The Bad &amp; The Beautiful Seminal 1952 melodrama. Coming soon In two weeks ...
