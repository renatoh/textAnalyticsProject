His and Sands' opener, Ham Hocks and Cabbage, is an initially sly-walking and then explosive soul-jazz sermon fit to blow the roof off in a nightclub; Hallelujah Time is a gospel-pounding vehicle for Sands in scorching Oscar Peterson mode; and My Favourite Things turns from a prolonged hover around the riff into a tempo-stretched reworking of the melody. Jazz has been played like this for decades, but that doesn't stifle the cheers when experts like these go for it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
