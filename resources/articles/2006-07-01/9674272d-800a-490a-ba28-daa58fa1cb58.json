Dr Nicholas Bartha, 66, died late on Saturday from injuries he suffered in the explosion which levelled the building a week ago. Police were unable to speak to him following the blast because he was in a medically-induced coma. Dr Bartha's ex-wife told police she received an email from him shortly before the explosion warning that she would be \"transformed from gold digger to ash and rubbish digger\". It continued: \"I always told you I will leave the house only if I am dead.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
