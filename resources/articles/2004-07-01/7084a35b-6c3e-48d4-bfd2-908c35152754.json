Martin Newland", "bodyText": "Job: editor, Daily Telegraph Age: 42 Industry: publishing Circulation: 880,950 (Dec 2003-May 2004) 2003 ranking: new entry Speculation has surrounded the future of Telegraph editor Martin Newland ever since the papers were put up for sale and Conrad Black's media empire was engulfed by scandal. But Newland, who took charge of the broadsheet last year following Charles Moore's retirement, is widely perceived as having done a good job in the most difficult of circumstances. And for a Telegraph editor he is remarkably interested in what its readers might perceive as low culture. At a conference in March 2004 he predicted that a rival paper proposed by Daily Mail columnist Stephen Glover was doomed because \"the Glover jihad extends not just to celebrities but crime - what we call 'marmalade dropper' stories\". \"When 17 million watch I'm a Celebrity, you can't be so snobbish as to ignore it.\" He also denounced the Times' bid to woo new readers as a \"jihad\" but said he \"quite liked the idea\" of a tabloid although claimed the expense of launching twin editions didn't seem to justify the benefits. The ownership of the Telegraph Group was finally resolved last month with its \u00a3665m purchase by the Barclay brothers and the early word is that no tabloid will be launched. But after joking that he would be the shortest lived editor in Fleet Street, Newland is understood to have been told by Sir David Barclay's son, Aidan, that he will remain as editor when they officially take control of the papers at the end of this month. There is much hard work to be done at the paper, which saw its circulation fall another 4% over the last 12 months, and in May 2004 sold fewer copies than the Daily Express. Sunday Telegraph editor Dominic Lawson and former editor of the Business, Jeff Randall, now business editor at the BBC, were both mooted as his possible replacement, but now it seems Newland will be given his head to turn the paper's fortunes around. Under Newland, the Telegraph has already moved away from the neo-Conservative political stance of its former proprietor, and Newland is understood to favour a return to the paper's former strengths, with an expanded news and foreign reporting section. Aping the tabloid format adopted by the Times and Independent is unlikely, but Newland is believed to want to introduce changes to the broadsheet format. Newland, who joined the Telegraph in the late 80s, worked his way up the ranks under Max Hastings and then Moore before leaving for Canada as founding editor of Conrad Black's Toronto paper, the National Post. He returned to Britain last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
