Do you have a phone number or address for contact purposes? Surely it must still honour this amount? AR A Music Zone went into administration in January following \"poorer than expected\" Christmas sales, though the company is continuing to trade while the administrators seek a buyer. If they fail to find one, Music Zone will be wound up and, as a customer, I'm afraid you would come bottom of the list for debt recovery. It's also unlikely that any new buyer would honour your credit note, though to be certain you should contact the administrators - Bill Dawson and Nick Dargan at Deloitte &amp; Touche on 0161 832 3555, 0161 455 6456 or 0161 455 8765."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
