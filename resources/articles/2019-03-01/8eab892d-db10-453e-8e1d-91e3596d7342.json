The women\u2019s national side, ranked sixth in the world, is currently without a permanent home but following a feasibility study commissioned late last year could now set up camp in Victoria by 2022, a year out from the 2023 World Cup. The new government-funded facility would feature a boutique 5,000-seater stadium to be used for low-level matches, and would host training camps and elite pathway programs for the Matildas, as well as other national and representative teams, and coaching and development programs. It would also serve as the new administrative headquarters for the state\u2019s governing body and play an important role in developing young talent as part of the new Emerging Matildas program. New Australia captain Sam Kerr said: \u201cIt would be an amazing thing for the Matildas to have their own base and somewhere we can call home, and to know it\u2019s ours so we can get the best out of not only the Matildas but of the Young Matildas.\u201d Six local government authorities \u2013 Brimbank, Casey, Darebin, Maribyrnong, Maroondah and Greater Shepparton \u2013 and La Trobe University, at its Bundoora campus, have submitted expressions of interest. Football Victoria president Kimon Taliadoros said the creation of such an elite training centre for football would mark \u201cthe coming of age for women\u2019s sport in Australia\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting initiative for the women\u2019s game in Australia and would serve to inspire generations of female footballers who dream of following in the steps of their heroes,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly, a dedicated facility would go a long way towards helping Victorian football meet our stated objective of 50:50 gender participation by 2027.\u201d The Matildas will wrap up their Cup of Nations campaign against Argentina on Wednesday night at Melbourne\u2019s AAMI Park, where a crowd of around 10,000 is expected. Should Ante Milicic\u2019s side avoid defeat, they will secure the inaugural title. Follow the action from AAMI Park with the Guardian\u2019s liveblog. Kick-off is 6pm AEDT on Wednesday"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
