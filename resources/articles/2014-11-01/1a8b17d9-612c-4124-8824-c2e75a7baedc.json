A video was released earlier in the day, seeming to show Kassig\u2019s head at the feet of an Isis militant. Administration officials spent Sunday examining the video. In a statement that referred to the name the Indiana native adopted after converting to Islam while in captivity, Obama said: \u201cWe offer our prayers and condolences to the parents and family of Abdul-Rahman Kassig, also known to us as Peter. We cannot begin to imagine their anguish at this painful time.\u201d Secretary of state John Kerry also released a statement. \u201cDuring [Kassig\u2019s] time in captivity,\u201d he said, \u201chis family, and the entire government, including his home state Senator Joe Donnelly, worked to avoid this tragic outcome. \u201cHis mother\u2019s searing plea directed to his captors is unforgettable. The fact that her appeal went unheeded is only further testament to the wicked inhumanity of the [Isis] terrorists who have taken her son from her.\u201d Obama was speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his return from the G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia. He praised Kassig as a humanitarian killed \u201cin an act of pure evil\u201d by Isis. The president said the group \u201crevels in the slaughter of innocents, including Muslims, and is bent only on sowing death and destruction\u201d. The video was released by al-Furqan Media, which is controlled by Isis. It showed a man who looked and sounded like a British-accented fighter seen in other such videos, standing over what appeared to be Kassig\u2019s severed head. The video also contained footage of what appeared to be the beheading of several captured Syrian soldiers. On Sunday, Isis claimed to have carried out a suicide bombing at Baghdad airport in Iraq. Five people were wounded. Kassig, a former army ranger who served in Iraq before returning to the Middle East and founding a humanitarian group, was captured in October 2013. \u201cThese were the selfless acts of an individual who cared deeply about the plight of the Syrian people,\u201d Obama said. He is the fifth western hostage to be killed by Isis. Two American journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and the British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, were the others to be killed. A British journalist, John Cantlie, is believed to be being held by Isis, who also hold a 26-year-old American woman who was taken while engaged in aid work last year. The woman\u2019s identity has not been revealed, out of fears for her safety. In October, Kassig\u2019s family released a letter written by him from captivity. He wrote: \u201cI am obviously pretty scared to die but the hardest part is not knowing, wondering, hoping, and wondering if I should even hope at all. \u201cIf I do die, I figure that at least you and I can seek refuge and comfort in knowing that I went out as a result of trying to alleviate suffering and helping those in need.\u201d On Sunday, the Kassig family released a statement regarding the loss of their \u201ctreasured son\u201d, and asked for the media to respect their privacy. In his statement, Obama said: \u201c[Isis\u2019s] actions represent no faith, least of all the Muslim faith which Abdul-Rahman adopted as his own.\u201d Kerry said: \u201cAbdul-Rahman Kassig, also known to us as Peter, was a young American who personified the values of altruism and compassion which are the very essence of his adopted religion of Islam.\u201d Earlier in the day, the Council on American-Islamic Relations condemned the \u201cbarbaric murder\u201d and repudiated \u201cthe anti-Islamic ideology that produces such brutality\u201d.
