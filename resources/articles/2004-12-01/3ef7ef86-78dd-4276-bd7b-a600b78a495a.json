Back in an era when it was truly meaningful, Stein would preach that the qualifying phase of major tournaments was a time to 'pull on the dungarees' to tackle the hard work, with the finals themselves an opportunity to 'wear your Sunday best'. Events at Ibrox and Murrayfield in the past few days, following Celtic's elimination from Europe and Scotland's pathetic two points from three World Cup outings, have demonstrated that the clubs and the national team no longer possess a good suit. Indeed, the moths seem to have even been at the working clothes. In the matter of landing prizes for culpability, Rangers surely take the lollipop. Placed in a Uefa Cup group so weak that it seemed impossible not to finish in the first three, Alex McLeish's team were even favoured by the order of play. One of their two away matches was against Amica Wronki, the Polish pub team whose presence in the group stage of the tournament remains a mystery. The Ibrox side's 5-0 victory in that opening match was followed by a 3-0 win over Grazer AK of Austria in Glasgow that seemed to make their passage into the last 32 as inevitable as sunrise. Even the 1-0 defeat by AZ Alkmaar in Holland in their third match could not have been regarded as a potentially fatal blow. The club now managed by Co Adriaanse have never lost a European match at home and Rangers are not exactly equipped to make that kind of history. The combination of the other results in the section, however, left them needing at least a draw from their final outing, at home to Auxerre last Wednesday, to be certain of qualification. Even defeat would have allowed them to progress, as long as the Austrians did not beat Alkmaar (the latter already assured of topping the group) at the Arnold Schwarzenegger stadium in Graz. But McLeish insisted that that match would have no bearing on Rangers' approach to their mission and that victory would be the goal because 'we wouldn't know how to play for a draw'. In the circumstances, the manager produced a bizarre game plan, one that hinted strongly at containment as his first priority, with thrusting ambition some way behind. As midfield players go, Fernando Ricksen is hardly Zinedine Zidane, but the Dutchman had been a powerful influence in Rangers' improved fortunes this season. McLeish removed him from the area where he has been effective and played him at right-back, with the Georgian Zurab Khizanishvili pressed into midfield with the specific instruction to man-mark Auxerre's Ivory Coast player, Bonaventure Kalou. He did such a terrific job that Kalou scored both goals in the French side's 2-0 victory. With Alkmaar losing by the same score, Rangers, astonishingly, were relegated to fourth place. The outcome of their endeavours in this tournament is a serious set-back for McLeish, who had been retrieving some lost credibility over the previous few weeks. Victories over Celtic in the CIS Insurance Cup and in the Premierleague, bringing at one stage a temporary lead in the championship, had supporters salivating over the prospect of ending the Celtic Park side's domestic dominance. The clamour that has followed the European failure has focused almost exclusively on McLeish's part in the debacle, rendering him vulnerable again. But it is reasonable to hypothesise that, even with Ricksen in midfield and Khizanishvili at right-back, Auxerre would have won. What McLeish's side demonstrated above all was a dreadful lack of subtlety, over-reliant on blind, uncoordinated charges forward in the hope that it would unsettle opponents who were much too smart to be intimidated. Far from cowering, Guy Roux's composed team simply passed Rangers towards a painful death. With Khizanishvili and Bob Malcolm, both essentially defenders, in the supposedly creative department in central midfield, this was not the surprise of the century. The most depressing post-script to the abysmal performance of McLeish's side was that even taking a single point would have preserved automatic qualification for the group stage of the Champions League for the Scottish title winners. Instead, Scotland were overtaken by Belgium and whoever wins this season's championship will have to go through a third qualifying round tie for at least the next two campaigns. Martin O'Neill talked earlier this year of the relief he felt at Celtic not having to pre-qualify in August, an uplifting experience that has proved to be disastrously short-lived. Hearts, too, had the opportunity to preserve the automatic place when they played Ferencvaros at home on Thursday. The 1-0 defeat not only put and end to that, but to the Tynecastle team's own prospects of progressing in the Uefa Cup. Even victory would not have been sufficient, since FC Basel's win over group winners Feyenoord in Switzerland would have left Hearts in fourth place at best in any case. But landing at the bottom of the section after a performance that was as uninspired and unthreatening as Rangers' the night before simply deepened the general dejection around the country. John Robertson's side were at least in a markedly stronger group than McLeish's team, while Celtic's achievement in taking five points from a Champions League section that included Milan, Barcelona and Shakhtar Donetsk begins to look not only forgivable, but highly commendable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
