To add to the antecedents cited, I suggest Lyra owes something to Cathy Earnshaw, whose creator, Emily Bront\u00eb, was memorably characterised by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar as \u201cMilton\u2019s rebellious daughter\u201d. It was Cathy for whom \u201cheaven did not seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the middle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke sobbing for joy.\u201d Substitute Oxford for the moors and I imagine Lyra would concur. Emma Jones Abingdon, Oxfordshire \u2022 No men\u2019s rugby union England team, nor any men\u2019s English football team, have won a World Cup unless Labour have been in government. Perhaps something to consider when deciding whether to vote Labour at the forthcoming general election. Barbara Hawkins Great Ayton, North Yorkshire \u2022 The print version of your article (Six ways to save money \u2013 and fight the climate crisis, 2 November) did not feature the easiest, cheapest and most effective way of reducing electricity consumption. Just change any remaining tungsten, halogen or compact fluorescent bulbs for LEDs. John Freeman Kingswinford, West Midlands \u2022 Your list of 10 best Jane Fonda films (G2, 1 November) missed out Cat Ballou! Admittedly Lee Marvin stole the show, but it\u2019s still a Fonda film. Steve Lupton Manchester \u2022 I can\u2019t believe Steelyard Blues is not in your assessment of Jane Fonda\u2019s best films. For me, it runs very close to Klute as being her best.
