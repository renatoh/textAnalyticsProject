Analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) shows that the number of people working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment has reached record levels, fuelling fears that the phenomenon of \"midworking\" will see a generation of people in a job but employed for only just enough hours to cover essential spending. Researchers put the cost of midworking at \u00a39bn in terms of lost earnings and benefits. The IPPR says the recession has hit the poorest hardest. Employment for people with fewer than five GCSEs has fallen by more than 8% since the recession began \u2013 far higher than other groups \u2013 and the thinktank says Britain's experience is likely to mirror the US, where there is much higher \"underemployment\" among less educated, lower skilled and lower income households. In the US, studies have shown this contributes to a \"high and rising degree\" of income inequality and growing poverty. Lisa Harker, co-director of the IPPR, warned that dealing with the shortage of jobs and the costs of underemployment had to be high on the agenda of an incoming government: \"While many people want to work part-time for family or other reasons, IPPR's analysis shows that a growing number of people are trapped in insecure work or unable to work enough hours to earn a decent income.\" Harker pointed out that more than one in five involuntary part-time workers are aged between 16 and 24: \"Young people in particular are victims of this growing trend and there is danger that their long-term employment prospects will be badly affected. The large number of underemployed workers does not attract as much attention as those who have no work at all, but this hidden phenomenon is in many ways just as big a problem.\" Economists say that a number of factors have led to the rise in midworkers. One is that firms have held on to workers during the economic downswing, preferring to cut hours rather than numbers. Another is that more generous tax credits have given rise to in-work benefits which could end up subsidising part-time work. \"We could be stoking part-time jobs with these bigger benefits,\" said Professor Jonathan Wadsworth, of the centre for economic performance at the London School of Economics. \"Not that part-time work is always bad. But you do not have a full-time income and the real problem is that [you] need to ensure part-time jobs are not dead-end jobs.\" Wadsworth said job creation remained a \"big concern\". He says the fact that employment fell only 3% while the economy shrank by 6% means companies are unlikely to be hiring when the economy picks up. The public sector, which was sheltered during the recession, will be shedding staff. All the parties have proposals to get people back into work \u2013 the Tory scheme will cost \u00a3600m \u2013 but Wadsworth doubted whether the Treasury could afford to create employment. \"Whoever gets into power will have to spend a lot of money to intervene [to create jobs]. I cannot see that happening.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
