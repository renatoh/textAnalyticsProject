I was a spokesperson for Save the Children and my job was to help set up an emergency communications team. It was my first experience of a humanitarian catastrophe and I was overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster. I\u2019d never seen anything like it. Neither had many of the aid veterans. The scale of the devastation and death \u2013 and need \u2013 was staggering. But what surprised me most was the huge appetite for debauchery among the foreigners who had flown in to help. I\u2019d been expecting death. Perhaps I was naive, but I hadn\u2019t been expecting sex. The capital was devastated and millions of people had lost their homes. The aftershocks meant it wasn\u2019t safe to sleep in the buildings that were still standing, most of which had been flimsy structures in the first place. The streets and parks were packed with families who had nothing and nowhere to go. We couldn\u2019t even reach the areas that were worst hit. The disaster killed more than 220,000 people and injured more than 300,000. Many people were still trapped under rubble and the city stank of rotting bodies. By some miracle, the Save the Children compound in P\u00e9tion-Ville had been untouched by the disaster. There weren\u2019t enough secure buildings for us to stay in, but most of the charity\u2019s staff slept in tents in the grounds. In the first week after the quake, I was awoken at night by the ground rippling with aftershocks and by street dogs, which had been feeding on human remains in the rubble, and were scratching to get inside my tent. But many of the thousands of humanitarians and journalists flown to Haiti to cover the disaster were staying at the UN compound, including the photographer I was working with. Through him, I got a detailed insight into the parallel life of the humanitarian community in Haiti in the weeks after the disaster. We were there for almost a month. Most days, we would drive out of our respective compounds into unbelievable horror. We saw children having legs amputated by surgeons beneath a tree in a park because the hospitals were in ruins. We met mothers who had been separated from their children and were desperately trying to find them, fearing that American evangelists might \u201cadopt\u201d them and that they would be lost forever. We saw people who were so hungry they looked ready to kill over sacks of rice. Against the backdrop of this horror, the photographer would tell me stories from inside the UN compound. There was a huge bowl of condoms next to the till in the UN canteen, he said. By the end of dinner every evening, this bowl would be empty. The aid workers and journalists packed into the compound were sleeping on floors, in courtyards, hallways, wherever there was space, so there wasn\u2019t much privacy. But a rota had been drawn up, he said, and at night the meeting rooms were booked up in hour-long slots for people to have sex. I should be clear, I didn\u2019t see \u2013 or experience \u2013 any of this myself. This is hearsay. Nor did I see or hear about any aid workers or journalists paying for sex. There didn\u2019t seem to be the need. And of course, sex in war and disaster zones isn\u2019t surprising. I\u2019ve seen a lot of it in other disasters since; there have been books written about it. There\u2019s a basic psychology to it, something about a primal need for comfort and trauma bonding. But what I found disturbing in Haiti was the profound disconnect between the overtly sexualised atmosphere in the aid and journalistic community and the visceral horror of the catastrophe surrounding us. I saw the international aid community do a lot of good in Haiti. It also brought cholera to an already devastated country. Now it appears that aid workers also took the opportunity to buy underage sex cheaply. Trauma bonding I can understand \u2013 callous exploitation I cannot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
