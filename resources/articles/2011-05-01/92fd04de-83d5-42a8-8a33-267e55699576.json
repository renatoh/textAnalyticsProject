April through November, the Flea is an outdoor affair, crowded with hungover hipsters and sunburned toddlers enjoying pupusas (Salvadoran stuffed tortillas) and locavore popsicles. On Saturdays, it takes place on a lot in Fort Greene (176 Lafayette Ave), while on Sundays it camps out on the Williamsburg waterfront (27 North 6th St). Once the weather turns cold, from Thanksgiving through March, the action moves indoors to the lobby of One Hanson, a spectacular landmarked building also known as the Williamsburg Savings Bank. The historic location adds a certain grandeur; you can practically feel the local pride reverberating off the vaulted ceilings. \u2022 brooklynflea.com Dalaga This frilly, girly clothing store is so warm and friendly that sometimes it feels like a sleepover party \u2013 ladies, you might want to leave your male companions outside (or send them to Alter down the block). Dresses tend to run at around $70 and come in various flavors of sexy and sweet; tops, some with flirty ruffles and some with daring cut-outs, fall in the $40-to-$65 range. Shoes and jewelry also run under $100, so it's easy to walk out with an entire party outfit. In fact, it might be wise to make sure you've got hot evening plans before you even walk in. \u2022 150 Franklin Street, +1 718 389 4049, dalaganyc.com Fred Flare The most adorable shop in Greenpoint, and possibly the entire five boroughs, Fred Flare appeals to the squealing six-year-old in each of us with candy-colored gifts and perky, shockingly inexpensive womenswear. Want a pencil case shaped like a hot dog? It's only $9! A harmonica necklace charm that plays music? A bargain at $12! Trendy mint green headphones? Well, those are $68, but they're also from high-quality audio brand UrbanEars. The shop is the only brick-and-mortar location for Fred Flare, which has built a cult following with its cuteness-obsessed website. Skip the neon-lit Times Square stores hawking \"I Heart NY\" shirts; this is a much better place to find presents for the folks back home. \u2022 131 Meserole Ave, fredflare.com Beacon's Closet A welcome antidote to New York's many precious, carefully curated consignment shops, Beacon's Closet is a massive warehouse of pre-worn clothing. Merchandise ranges from vintage Diane von Furstenberg to timeless denim from Wrangler and Levi's to two-year-old H&amp;M, all of it hip enough to survive an inspection by the store's highly discerning buyers. They can afford to be picky \u2013 Beacon's is set smack in the middle of the most fashion-obsessed neighborhood in Brooklyn, which means stylists and other industry insiders unload here. Prices wouldn't necessarily pass for \"thrift\" anywhere else in the country, but you can expect to pay less here than you would at Topshop or Urban Outfitters. \u2022 88 N 11th Street, +1 718 486 0816, beaconscloset.com Dijital Fix If the collection of shops at 218 Bedford is Williamsburg's answer to a mall, then Dijital Fix is its version of Best Buy. But because this is Brooklyn, the gadgets here are sleek and unusual. Bestsellers include Danish headphones and a portable turntable that comes packaged in its own case with built-in speakers. Photographers will geek out over the range of cameras, while Luddites should find plenty to admire among the minimalist Field Notes notebooks. And nobody can resist the EcoSpheres, fully contained self-sustaining ecosystems in which tiny shrimp gambol among seaweed in a dome the size of a paperweight. \u2022 218 Bedford Ave, +1 800 670 8941, dijitalfix.com The Brooklyn Kitchen The Brooklyn Kitchen offers toys for all types of gourmands, from experts who regularly butcher their own meat to casual foodies who just want to read a nice chef memoir while someone else does the cooking. The atmosphere and the merchandise are equally no-nonsense and user-friendly: Look for homey linens, heavy-duty cookware like Le Creuset pots, and high-design kitchen gifts such as silicon oven mitts and steamers. DIY-ers love the in-store classes like \"Grow What You Eat, Eat What You Grow\" and \"Introduction to Homebrewing,\" while carnivores love the fact that the shop shares its big, industrial space with The Meat Hook, a decidedly non-vegetarian specialty foods shop. \u2022 100 Frost St, +1 718 389 2982, thebrooklynkitchen.com Alter Like Oak without the attitude, Alter is a mini-chain specializing in cool clothes for cool kids. It's a trek from the subway to their original Greenpoint shops \u2013 one for men and one for women \u2013 but the young, trendy, and broke are willing to make the pilgrimage to shop for affordable, hard-to-find indie brands and repurposed vintage. Accessories are also a big draw, especially the sustainably-produced Osborn shoes and the insanely cheap sunglasses. The newer Williamsburg shop, in a still-gentrifying neighborhood several stops past the area's Bedford Avenue center, stocks the same merchandise but caters to both men and women. Bonus: It's only a few blocks from Motorino, which has some of the best pizza currently available in New York City. \u2022 407 Graham Ave, + 1 718 609 0203, alterbrooklyn.blogspot.com Dear Fieldbinder Women in leafy brownstone Brooklyn have perfected a certain laid-back, quirky-casual look \u2013 think of local resident Michelle Williams, with her pixie haircut and geek-chic oxfords. Dear Fieldbinder has zeroed in on that look with laser-like precision, offering a complete wardrobe for the young creative-professional types who populate the neighborhood. The dresses come from up-and-coming labels ranging from the sweetly retro Lauren Moffatt to the sophisticated, menswear-inspired Won Hundred, while the shoes are sourced from cool-kid brands like Marais USA and F-Troupe. And unlike in so many Manhattan shops, the salespeople don't turn into ice queens when you ask questions \u2013 instead, they're downright chatty. Taken as a whole, the effect is fashion-forward but never pretentious. \u2022 198 Smith Street, +1 718 852 3620, dearfieldbinder.com Epaulet Mostly-menswear shop Epaulet has hit on the perfect combination for couples shopping together: give the guys a range of well-tailored basics to sample, and keep the ladies occupied with a tightly-edited collection of shoes. The owners, themselves a married couple, are obsessed with sustainable production, though never at the expense of style. Ask about the provenance of a chambray shirt or a pair of house-label jeans, and you're liable to wind up getting a mini-lesson on American fashion history disguised as a funny story about the road trip they took to the factory. For girls, the shop does carry a small range of tops, dresses, and jackets, but the real focus is on Epaulet-brand clogs and footwear from such crunchy-but-trendy brands as Melissa and Toms. \u2022 231 Smith St, +1 718 522 3800, epauletshop.com Erie Basin Hidden in quiet, industrial Red Hook, this tiny shop focusses on antique jewelry. Owner Russell Whitmore has an eye for period pieces that appeal to contemporary sensibilities, like Victorian mourning brooches and Art Deco engagement rings \u2013 many a hipster marriage proposal has its genesis here. Red Hook as a whole is worth a day trip \u2013 it's the least gentrified corner of south Brooklyn, meaning quirky local businesses can afford to thrive amid the waterfront grit. The Van Brunt shopping strip offers crafts, vintage, and highly acclaimed eating and drinking options, and the Fairway supermarket has marvelous views of the Statue of Liberty, but Erie Basin is where you're most likely to find something you'll want to take home. \u2022 388 Van Brunt Street, +1 718 554 6147, eriebasin.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
