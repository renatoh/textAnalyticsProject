The Ministry of Defence is considering new measures that would prevent serving officers and civil servants being compromised by formal and informal meetings with lobbyists. Labour said the government must enshrine this in a new code of conduct. Bernard Jenkin, the Tory chair of the public administration select committee, has written to Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, urging him to accept proposals to establish in law a conflicts of interest commissioner. Jenkin said he had warned ministers that scandals were inevitable, and demanded a change in government policy. The furore began at the weekend when six senior former members of the armed forces were caught in a sting by the Sunday Times. Reporters posed as representatives of a South Korean defence firm seeking help to lobby the MoD. Two of those who offered to help, Admiral Sir Trevor Soar and Lieutenant General Richard Applegate, appeared to be doing so in breach of rules set out by the advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba). The rules state that former officers should respect a two-year purdah between leaving office and starting to work as lobbyists. Two others duped by the newspaper, Lord Dannatt, the former head of the army, and Lord Stirrup, the former chief of the defence staff, will be investigated by the House of Lords independent commissioner of standards. All six of the officers secretly filmed by the Sunday Times have denied any impropriety. On Monday Lieutenant General Sir John Kiszely resigned as president of the Royal British Legion, after he described the remembrance festival as a tremendous networking opportunity. The revelations threw a spotlight on Acoba, an independent body that can give advice but has no powers to punish former officers, ministers or civil servants if they decide to ignore it. This has prompted Labour to draft its own code of conduct and urge the government to adopt its key principles. They include banning personnel from public appointments if they ignore Acoba's advice, extending the period of purdah to up to five years in certain cases, and fining defence companies that employ lobbyists who break the rules. Defence companies could have contracts cancelled or reviewed if they are caught defying Acoba. The MoD would be required to publish a list of all personnel who have left service and would need to abide by Acoba rules, so that nobody could be in any doubt about who can and cannot work as lobbyists. Jim Murphy, the shadow defence secretary, said: \"The government should consider a tough new code of conduct for the defence industry and lobbyists. There must be sanctions for wrongdoers and deterrents for others. Advocacy is important but it must be totally transparent, which is why we are arguing that companies must disclose their lobbyists and military figures must be open about their meetings. Important rules are in place, but they must be enforceable and strengthened.\" The Cabinet Office said it was still considering the proposals from the select committee, which were published in July. In his letter to Maude, Jenkins said the recent coverage had been \"deeply corrosive to public trust in politics and the public service. It is exactly the kind of scenario that our rep warned against, and it demands a change of government policy.\" He added: \"This case reinforces the need for a statutory conflicts of interest commissioner, backed by statutory rules, which will establish a culture in which people respect both the rules and also respect the spirit which should underlie the rules.\" An MoD spokesperson said: \"As the defence secretary made clear on Sunday, equipment is procured in the interests of our armed forces and not in the interests of retired senior personnel. The defence secretary and the MoD's permanent secretary have been discussing the issues raised on Sunday and want the department to be as open as possible to ensure access is not abused for commercial purposes. Defence ministers, the permanent secretary and the chief of defence material already all publish their external meetings quarterly and the MoD is looking at what further measures can be taken.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
