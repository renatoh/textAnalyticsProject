We still make love at least once, usually twice, a day, occasionally more than that. For me, nothing else in life comes anywhere close to the complete euphoria it brings. Now we\u2019re older, sex takes longer, but that\u2019s a bonus. I reckon we must have made love something like 22,000 times over the years, and yet each new experience is full of passion and desire. In some ways there is even greater urgency, because time is going by and we need to make the most of every occasion. There\u2019s been plenty of scope for variety. We\u2019ve experimented with all sorts of positions, more than a hundred altogether, and with locations outside the bedroom, including a corner of our garden. One memorable highlight was six sessions in a private swimming pool, where we managed to sustain uninterrupted coitus for two hours at a time over a couple of exhilarating days. We\u2019ve repeated that on several occasions Neither of us can contemplate the idea of sex with anyone else. It\u2019s something unique we have together. Love and sex for us are inextricably bound up with each other. Life apart is unthinkable, though we know it will happen one day. Our memories and the joy of seeing our children and grandchildren thrive will be consolation for whichever one of us is left behind. Meanwhile, we couldn\u2019t be happier, and hope there are lots more opportunities for cuddles and sex still to come. \u2022 Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life. Want to share yours?
