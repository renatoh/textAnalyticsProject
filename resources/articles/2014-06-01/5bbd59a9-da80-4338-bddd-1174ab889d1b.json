Kasai Allstars are a 16-piece band made up of five different groups from the Kasai region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, joined here by an extra 24 guest musicians. All of the tracks involve chanting, an insistent array of percussion and relentless riffs from guitars, xylophones and the amplified, distorted likembe thumb piano. There are some extraordinary moments, from the unaccompanied chanting and likembe workout on Thus Spoke the Ancestors to the suitably spooky and edgy title track. Several of the musicians took part in the Congotronics vs Rockers project three years ago, along with members of Konono No 1, their producer Vincent Kenis and singer Juana Molina, and the final track is a suitably frantic reminder of that tour. Play it very loud."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
