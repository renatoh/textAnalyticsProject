In an interview with the BBC, the Dalai Lama also said that while he was a supporter of the EU and thought it would be better for the UK to remain part of it, he did not want to see Europe become \u201cMuslim\u201d or \u201cAfrican\u201d. Asked about the US president, whom the Tibetan spiritual leader has previously unflatteringly impersonated, he said: \u201cHis emotions [are] also a little bit,\u201d and made a gesture waggling his finger near his temple. \u201cOne day he says something, another day he says something. But I think [there is a] lack of moral principle. When he became president, he expressed America first. That is wrong. America, they should take the global responsibility.\u201d The Dalai Lama was asked about the EU, of which he said he was an admirer: \u201cI am [an] outsider, but I feel better [to] remain in the European Union.\u201d The interviewer, the BBC\u2019s Rajini Vaidyanathan, pointed out the campaign for Britain to leave the EU used one of the Dalai Lama\u2019s quotes about migration to Europe as part of its campaign. \u201cThe goal should be that migrants return and help rebuild their countries. You have to be practical. It\u2019s impossible for everyone to come,\u201d he had said. The Dalai Lama reiterated this position, saying that while European countries should take in refugees and educate and train them, the aim should be to return them to their home countries. Asked if refugees should be allowed to stay in Europe if they wished to, he said only a limited number ought to be able to remain. \u201cBut [for the] whole [of] Europe [to] eventually become [a] Muslim country? Impossible. Or [an] African country, also impossible,\u201d he said while laughing, adding: \u201cKeep Europe for Europeans.\u201d The Dalai Lama was also asked about comments he made in 2015 that if a female Dalai Lama were to replace him then she must be \u201cvery attractive, otherwise not much use\u201d. He laughed when asked if he understood why the response had offended women, saying: \u201cIf [a] female Dalai Lama comes then she should be more attractive. If [a] female Dalai Lama,\u201d before pulling a face, \u201cI think, [people would] prefer not [to] see her, that face.\u201d The Dalai Lama also said he had not given up hope of returning to Tibet, from which he has been exiled since 1959, and that he has been in contact with senior retired Chinese officials. He said he thought the Chinese people were changing their attitudes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
