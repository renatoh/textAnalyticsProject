These potential \u201coutliers\u201d \u2013 aged 36, 50, 53, 55 and 58 \u2013 are a reminder that scientists are still racing to understand the nature and impact of the new disease as it spreads in China and around the world. The virus is far less deadly than severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), another coronavirus-caused respiratory disease, which emerged in China in 2002. Nearly one in 10 people infected with Sars died, while the epidemic in Wuhan has so far killed about 2% of those who contracted it. That rate could potentially come down even further, as authorities get better at detecting and testing for less seriously affected patients, said Antonia Ho, consultant in infectious diseases at Glasgow University\u2019s Centre for Virus Research. \u201cAt the start of an outbreak detection will always be skewed towards severe cases because those are the ones that are going to be picked up by doctors and hospitals, because they need treatment. But as surveillance improves you will pick up less severe cases, and they are more likely to survive. \u201cWe won\u2019t know the accurate fatality rate until we can do large population studies, when you can find out the number of people who were infected but either had no symptoms or very mild ones.\u201d Cases recorded so far suggest most infections are not serious. \u201cIt appears that the majority of infected persons have mild symptoms, though a small proportion do develop breathing difficulties, including pneumonia,\u201d said Ho, a specialist in respiratory epidemics. The question for experts is who might be susceptible to getting more seriously sick \u2013 and with many cases only recently recorded, how long it takes to identify cases that need more medical help. A recent paper suggests that it takes an average of eight days from symptoms first appearing to the onset of breathing difficulties, according to Ho. \u201cIt can seem OK at first, then get much more serious, though only in a small proportion of people.\u201d So far, although infections have been identified in children as young as two, the vast majority of victims have been older, and most have had underlying health conditions. The Observer has compiled a list of 47 coronavirus victims, whose cases were reported in detail by Chinese authorities up to 29 January. Most were provided by the government of Hubei, the province at the centre of the crisis, which gave the last case details on 25 January, with others from Sichuan and Henan provinces, and city authorities in Beijing and Shanghai. They show many victims already suffered from illnesses including diabetes, heart problems, chronic bronchitis and other conditions. However there\u2019s no explanation for the apparent \u201coutlier\u201d cases of relatively young victims, and no details as to why these cases have been made public. But they do raise questions about whether some healthy people in middle age could be vulnerable to the disease. The youngest victim, aged 36, was of particular concern, experts said, because it was unclear what made him susceptible, and if it was something that could affect others. \u201cThis 36-year-old is an enigma,\u201d David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told Time magazine. \u201cWe know that the majority of people who have died to date have co-morbidity and are elderly.\u201d Adding to the concerns is data showing that the disease spreads more easily than Sars, with some of those infected able to pass it on before they show symptoms. A cluster of four cases in Germany appears to have originated with a single traveller who didn\u2019t show any signs of illness until after she had left the country, a group of scientists warned in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine this week. That may make it much harder to control the spread. Sars patients could largely be isolated as soon as they became infectious \u2013 when symptoms began to show \u2013 making it easier to trace and monitor contacts who could be at risk. Modelling research published in the Lancet estimates that up to 75,800 people in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, may have been infected with the new coronavirus by 25 January. If the fatality rate stayed the same, at about 2%, that could mean more than 1,500 deaths. Far fewer than flu causes each year, but still more than the Sars outbreak. And scientists have warned that even if the outbreak is brought under control, the number of new infections may keep rising for weeks or longer. \u201cI don\u2019t think we know enough at the moment to say how it\u2019s going to pan out,\u201d said Paul Hunter, professor of health protection at the University of East Anglia. \u201cIt\u2019s still plausible that this will be restricted to China and a few other countries and will ultimately peter out and disappear by the end of the summer. But it\u2019s also plausible that it will spread very widely,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced that we have enough data yet for the models to be sufficiently convincing about where between those two extremes it will eventually fit.\u201d Additional reporting by Jonathan Zhong"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
