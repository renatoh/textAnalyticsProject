British Horseracing Authority officials, who plan to inspect the course before the next meeting on 8 July, have ordered reports from their racecourse stewards on duty and the Worcester executive amid concerns about the lack of water available to cool down distressed horses. Temperatures in the stable yard, where the horses are kept before going out to race, reached 90 degrees at the Midlands track according to the BHA vet on duty yesterday, and the runners were getting dehydrated before they were due to race. It was clear there were serious problems following the running of the opening event after which two horses collapsed owing to heat exhaustion, including the third-placed runner Highland Laddie. So much water had to be used to help revive the gelding that the staff at the track were having difficulty re-filling the water holders at the course. Track management and senior officials at the BHA were adamant, however, that welfare concerns and not a shortage of on-course water was the reason racing was called off. Professor Tim Morris, director of equine science and welfare at the BHA, said: \"The length of time taken for the distressed horse to be treated for dehydration, and the amount of water used, was exceptional. The delay this caused, coupled with the exceptionally high temperatures in the stable yard, meant the horses due to run in the following race were already becoming dehydrated. The abandonment of racing on the grounds of horse welfare was undoubtedly the right course of action. \"We have asked for separate reports from both the stewards and the Worcester executive and our racecourse inspectorate will visit Worcester ahead of their next meeting to see if any improvements can be made in terms of the availability of water.\" Fergus Cameron, the clerk of the course at Worcester, has promised a full review. He said: \"We will obviously be making what changes are appropriate to bring some improvements. Today was not good. But the facilities we have, until today, proved to be more than adequate for what was needed.\"He said all racegoers would be able to have free entry into any other meeting at Worcester later this season. There are bound to be wider concerns raised about summer jump racing, which has grown significantly in recent years, following yesterday's distressing scenes and local trainer James Evans says changes may have to be made. He told the Attheraces TV channel covering the meeting: \"I wrote to the summer jump racing committee two years ago on some issues. I think we need to learn from what has happened and modify our systems. \"Running races in excess of three miles in the heat of the afternoon \u2013 that will have to be looked at. Maybe we need more evening meetings. Horses are being asked to gallop flat out for over two miles \u2013 that's quite a lot to ask of horses in extreme heat.\" Tim Vaughan, who saddled Trevian to win what proved to be the only race of the day, accepted the decision to abandon the remainder of the card but was critical of the day's events. He said: \"I had said to them that they have got a river just 50 yards away and it wouldn't have taken long to get a pump or something to get more water that way. I do love having runners there, and I don't want to criticise too much, but it was a bit of a farcical scene. \"Under the circumstances it was the right decision to abandon for the horses' welfare, I just felt it was all lacking in some common sense in the first place. There were hundreds of people there today and I have spent owners' money bringing the horses across.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
