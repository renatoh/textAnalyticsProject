Big deal", "bodyText": "David Bowie went to a shop and bought something. This is news because he doesn't do that much. Apparently. Or is it perhaps that he doesn't do it much, because whenever he does, it's news? The Telegraph reports that Bowie bears \"little resemblance to the fashion icon of the 1970s\". The Daily Mail reports that he was wearing clothes. It's pretty amazing that a man can be hounded by the world's press as he goes about his daily life, simply because his talents brought joy to so many people. Pretty amazing, petty-minded and destructive. The trouble with the press is that it's stupid, exploitative and insensitive, and thinks it has a \"right\" to be so."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
