Through four prolific decades in the film industry, he built a reputation as a master creator of robotic/animatronic creatures and prosthetic makeup, well-versed at blending physical effects with computer-generated imagery. For his groundbreaking work in special effects, and as a makeup designer, Winston was highly honoured in Tinseltown. Working with big-name directors including Steven Spielberg, James Cameron and Tim Burton, he was nominated for an Oscar 10 times, winning on four occasions. His relationship with Cameron was especially fruitful; he won a visual effects Oscar for Cameron's Aliens (1986), visual effects and makeup prizes for the same director's Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and the visual effects award for Spielberg's Jurassic Park (1993). At the time of his death, he was working on Cameron's latest movie, Avatar. \"He ran at full throttle, in both work and play, and was a man of kindness, wisdom and great humour,\" Cameron said. \"He was a kid that never grew up, whose dreams were writ large on the screens of the world.\" Winston was born in Arlington, Virginia, and, as a child, enjoyed drawing, puppetry and monster movies. After graduating in art from the University of Virginia in 1968, he moved to southern California, hoping, like many, to make it as an actor. But he was soon drawn to the world behind the camera. Partly inspired by watching the movie Planet of the Apes, remarkable for its use of prosthetics, he completed a makeup apprenticeship programme at Walt Disney studios. In 1972, he launched Stan Winston Studio from the garage of his home in Northridge, Los Angeles (it now boasts more than 50 employees). Beginning work as a makeup artist in television, he quickly collected two Emmy awards. His work on the 1974 TV movie The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman, in which the title character, played by Cicely Tyson, ages from 19 to 110, turned heads in the industry and he was soon working on big-budget feature films. Besides his four Oscars, nominations came for Heartbeeps (1981), Predator (1987), Edward Scissorhands (1990), Batman Returns (1992), The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) and Artificial Intelligence: AI (2001). Winston also won three special effects Baftas and achieved yet more kudos in 2001 when he became the first special effects exponent to receive a star in the sidewalk on Hollywood Boulevard. The governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his former guise as a muscle-bound action star, battled hordes of Winston's terrifying creations in Predator, and they became friends during the making of the movie, sharing a passion for motorbikes, cigars and chess. Winston, as the New Yorker magazine described several years ago, was celebrated for \"almost single-handedly elevating the craft of creature-making from the somewhat comic man-in-a-rubber-suit monsters of the 1950s and 60s to animatronics - electronically animated, part-robot, part-puppet creatures that have terrified millions of moviegoers\". Yet for all his technical wizardry, he preferred to be considered a \"character creator\". \"It's not about technology,\" he once said. \"It's about writers writing wonderful stories with fantastic characters and me being able to create a visual image that's beyond what you'd expect.\" Most recently, Winston successfully collaborated with director Jon Favreau on the comic-based action movie Iron Man. Despite some film industry reservations about Robert Downey Jr's credentials as an all-action leading man, the film proved an enormous critical and commercial success. A great deal of the credit must go to Stan Winston Studio, whose hi-tech armoured suits delighted both the Marvel comic's diehard fans (a notoriously tough audience to please) and young audiences new to the character, who packed out multiplex cinemas worldwide. \"He was experienced and helped guide me while never losing his childlike enthusiasm,\" Favreau said. \"He was the king of integrating practical effects with computer-generated imagery, never losing his relevance in an ever-changing industry.\" Winston is survived by his wife, Karen, his son Matt and daughter Debbie. \u00b7 Stanley Winston, special effects and makeup artist, born April 7 1946; died June 15 2008"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
