Now the lives of the Danish crown princess, Mary, and the crown prince, Frederik, are to be depicted on screen in 2015 with two television projects charting their lives and romance. Neither project has been approved by the palace, but Mary: The Making of a Princess is billed as a \u201ctrue life fairytale\u201d about how Australian Mary Donaldson met Prince Frederik at a Sydney pub in 2000. Her prince will be getting the biopic treatment in Frederik\u2019s Young Years \u2013 focusing on his playboy reputation in the 1990s. The latter is directed by 36-year-old actor/screenwriter/director Christian Tafdrup, who played the dastardly TV executive Alex in the final series of Borgen (Danes in showbusiness tend to multitask). Despite Tafdrup\u2019s royal project being unauthorised, the Danish ministry for cultural affairs has contributed 200,000 Danish kroner (about \u00a321,000) towards script development via the Danish Film Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s an ambitious project for me,\u201d said Tafdrup. \u201cI haven\u2019t yet directed a feature film [he is to direct his first full-length feature in January] and I\u2019ve got to make 10 years of Crown Prince Frederik\u2019s life into one believable story. But I\u2019ve got a good relationship with the film institute from working on short films for them, so I guess they trusted me to do a good job.\u201d The government funding is indicative of the country\u2019s relaxed attitude and irreverence towards its royals. While most Danes wouldn\u2019t describe themselves as monarchists, Queen Margrethe is the most popular monarch in Europe with approval ratings of 70%. \u201cWe tend to feel close to our royals in Denmark,\u201d said Tafdrup, \u201cand they come across as quite normal. There\u2019s a lot of gossip about them in magazines, but I was interested in the idea of Frederik as an ordinary guy, like the rest of us, who was just born into this really different life.\u201d Frederik\u2019s Young Years will chart the life of the prince between the ages of 22 and 32, featuring previous flames including former Danish MP Malou Aamund and model Katja Storkholm as well as Frederik\u2019s meeting with his future wife during the 2000 Sydney Olympics. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to a few people close to Frederik with his permission,\u201d said Tafdrup, \u201cbut it\u2019s a tricky area. I understand that the palace may not want me to do this film but my intention isn\u2019t to be rude \u2013 I\u2019m interested in creating fiction based on facts. It\u2019s a universal story about what it\u2019s like to be a young man coming of age, set in a royal environment \u2013 it\u2019s definitely not a royal soap opera.\u201d The competing biopic on the royal couple may not have such lofty ideals \u2013 it\u2019s being produced by Fremantle Media Australia, the company behind the teatime telly classic and students\u2019 favourite Neighbours. Mary: The Making of a Princess is about how difficult it was for the Tasmanian-born estate agent Mary Donaldson to adapt to royal life and how the \u201chappy-go-lucky girl from Hobart\u201d transformed into a royal renowned for her sense of style. Australian actors Margot Robbie, 24, and Rose Byrne, 35, are the frontrunners to play Mary, according to Australia\u2019s Gold Coast Bulletin, but Fremantle Media\u2019s Sydney publicity manager, Adrian Motte, insisted there was everything to play for. \u201cWe haven\u2019t cast yet or shot a frame and we don\u2019t have a director that we can announce at this stage but the project is being overseen by Fremantle Media Australia\u2019s Head of Drama, Jo Porter. Jo oversees all of FMA\u2019s drama output, including Neighbours,\u201d said Motte. Most Danes seem untroubled by the impending explorations of their royal family. But after a recent spate of regal film flops, everyone will be hoping that their royal power couple won\u2019t be handled in the vein of Grace of Monaco, Diana, or worse Hallmark\u2019s 2011, William &amp; Catherine: A Royal Romance \u2013 a film reviewed by the Guardian\u2019s Stephen Bates as \u201ctoe-curlingly, teeth-furringly, pillow-bitingly ghastly\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
