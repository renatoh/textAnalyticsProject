A hard-earned victory over Watford at the City Ground made it six npower Championship wins in a row and 34 league games undefeated at home going back to last season. Success also took them into second place in the table \u2013 they lay in 19th position in late August \u2013 and laid the foundations for the confrontation with Queens Park Rangers, the runaway leaders, at Loftus Road next Sunday. Seven points may be the difference between the sides but Forest have two games in hand. Game on for the two automatic places in the Premier League next season; game on, indeed, with Norwich City and Swansea City, among others, also likely to have a say. At this rate, for Forest, the form horses, qualifying for the end-of-term play-offs would almost represent failure. Yet that is where Billy Davies, the feisty Forest manager, reckons they might end up. \"When I look at all the other clubs, the competition is so fierce,\" he said. \"An honest evaluation? I think that we might be a little short of automatic promotion but are great candidates for the play-offs. \"Second place? We are where we are. There's still 18 games to go. I'm going to bore you with all that usual bollocks. It's only February. QPR? Don't tell me that it's any bigger than the game the following week or the last five games of the season. It's just about accumulating points over 18 matches.\" Davies can be an awkward cuss, bemoaning everyone from Lady Luck to the Forest boardroom to rival managers, on a regular basis and in that apparently always-threatening Glaswegian accent. It is a nature born of a footballing passion, worn unashamedly on his sleeve. It might not be everyone's cup of tea but it appears to be working at Forest, especially at the fortress that the City Ground has become. Not since Blackpool plundered a 1-0 win in September 2009 \u2013 eight months after Davies's arrival and now 34 regulation league games ago \u2013 have Forest lost on home soil. Naturally, Forest's remarkable 4-3 defeat \u2013 also against Blackpool \u2013 in the second leg of their Championship play-off semi-final last May is not counted in the lengthy unbeaten sequence. It is a memory that few Forest fans, let alone Davies, would care to recall. It took only 52 seconds for Davies's slick-passing team to take the lead, the ball swept crisply along the left flank before Chris Cohen found Marcus Tudgay lurking in the Watford penalty area. A quick shimmy and swift shot, which Scott Loach got a hand to, and Forest had made the perfect start. Watford might have folded. Their six successive league wins, which had enabled them to rise from 14th to sixth in the table, seemed a long time ago. That they had not won in their previous three matches, including a startling loss to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in the FA Cup fourth round, had not augured well. Curiously, though, Tudgay's strike appeared to inspire not deflate them. Lee Camp saved smartly from Danny Graham after the Watford striker had fastened on to a sloppy Luke Chambers backpass. A Will Buckley cross proved too fierce for any team-mate to touch in and Camp produced a marvellous leap to keep out Lloyd Doyley's piledriver. Forest, organised and rarely prone to panic, absorbed the pressure and retaliated as the suited-and-booted Davies urged them on from his technical area. Only Loach's fingertip save prevented Cohen from making it 2-0; only the erratic finishing of Robert Earnshaw prevented the match from being effectively over by the hour mark. Watford responded valiantly but Graham was again thwarted by Camp while Buckley fell too easily in the area under the challenges of first Chambers and then Chris Gunter. Graham Scott, the referee, was not fooled. No spot-kicks, he ruled. \"They were stonewall penalties,\" Malky Mackay, the Watford manager, said. \"Unquestionable, both of them.\" No fear, though, of Davies shutting up shop. On came Lewis McGugan, Nathan Tyson and Dele Adebola, as attacking a trio of substitutes as any manager could wish for, and Forest comfortably held off the late Watford rally. Next stop Loftus Road; a stern test of Forest's emerging Premier League credentials."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
