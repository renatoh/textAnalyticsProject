The blockade, backed by Republican senators, was political: WikiLeaks had published Chelsea Manning\u2019s material documenting US military drone strikes and civilian killings in Iraq; stopping inflowing cash silenced Julian Assange\u2019s outfit, albeit temporarily. What could be done? Perhaps it was time for a cryptocurrency to stride from the proverbial phone booth, underpants over its tights, and save the day? After all, bitcoin\u2019s philosophy was that it would cut out the middleman, whether state functionary or corporate lackey, and realise a radical future in which, for instance, Afghan women, prohibited from opening bank accounts, might work and get paid in bitcoin. Certainly, in December 2010 there was much enthusiasm from cypherpunks for WikiLeaks to link to bitcoin on their website for donations. In a fascinating thread on bitcointalk.org reproduced in this book, Mike Gogulski wrote: \u201cScrew big business. Google, Microsoft and Wal-Mart can all eat flaming death as far as I\u2019m concerned \u2026 where systems like bitcoin can be helpful is in making both government and big business irrelevant and obsolete.\u201d Why aren\u2019t we living in that radical future in 2019? One reason is bitcoin\u2019s enemies made sure it never arrived. The Indian government, for instance, refused to recognise bitcoin as legal tender. Facebook refused cryptocurrency ads while developing its own. Earlier this month, it launched the cryptocurrency Libra, opening the possibility that Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s techno-oligarchy is not just more valuable and powerful than many nation states but will be able to print its own money too. What remains is nostalgia for the recent past, when the takedown of the powers that be seemed possible. On the same 2010 thread, another cypherpunk added: \u201cbring it on. Let\u2019s encourage Wikileaks to use Bitcoins.\u201d But it didn\u2019t happen. Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious, pseudonymous, probably not Japanese but possibly British, perhaps even multiple bitcoin inventor, nixed the idea: \u201cNo, don\u2019t \u2018bring it on\u2019 \u2026 I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy \u2026 the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.\u201d Bitcoin has since disappointed radicals who hoped it might spark revolution. Ten years ago the first bitcoin transaction took place. Since then, fortunes have been amassed (in December 2017 Nakamoto was worth over $19bn, making him/her/they possibly the 44th richest person in the world, if he/she/they is a person), and fortunes have been lost since early 2018, when bitcoin\u2019s bubble burst. That failure is not just down to Bitcoin\u2019s enemies, but internal too. Power over the Bitcoin network has concentrated in the hands of those few whose computer power and maths skills are sufficient to mine for bitcoins (mining involves using costly software to solve maths problems and miners help keep the Bitcoin network secure by approving transactions). Just as the Sex Pistols got co-opted by the business they postured as seeking to destory, and just as the vision of a decentralised, uncensored, free internet foundered with its commercialisation, so Bitcoin has been taken over by those whom economist Nouriel Roubini calls \u201ccharlatans and swindlers\u201d. What\u2019s worth salvaging is not so much bitcoin, but Nakamoto\u2019s vision for it. Like FBI agent Fox Mulder in The X-Files only more so, Nakamoto trusts no one and that philosophy has underpinned his/her/their invention. In bitcoin, cryptographic proof replaces the uncertain trust of humans in institutions. The tricky notion of the blockchain is key to that: what it amounts to is that verified but unconfirmed transactions are aggregated into a block that is spread across the network of users and added to a stack of other blocks. This blockchain is held, at least in theory, by every user, in a \u201cdistributed ledger\u201d that obviates the need for a central third party authority. The purpose of this little book is to explain how the blockchain works and why it still inspires. It consists of Nakamoto\u2019s breakthrough 2008 paper Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, a guide to it by blockchain aficionado Jaya Klara Brekke, along with appendices, an introduction by James Bridle and informative essays parallelling bitcoin with the cryptographic work at Bletchley Park that helped the allies defeat the Nazis. \u201cI want to make your eyes shine in bright-eyed wonder as you reread the Bitcoin white paper, just as mine did,\u201d Brekke writes. That\u2019s the peril and pleasure of the book: her guide mixes the off-putting ardour of a doorstep God botherer with excitement over the elegance and unrealised potential of Nakamoto\u2019s idea. Bitcoin may be in the recycling bin of radical initiatives, and Nakamoto unheard of since 2014, but the blockchain idea of a self-sustaining framework for the development of consensus is still worth developing \u2013 and not just to change how we spend. In our serially disappointed age, the blockchain suggests a way better than mere cynicism about state and privacy-violating corporations, albeit one that doesn\u2019t seem ready to take over the world any time soon. \u2022 The White Paper is published by Ignota (\u00a312.99).
