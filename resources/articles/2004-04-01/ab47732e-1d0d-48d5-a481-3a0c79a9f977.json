Yes, he can", "bodyText": "David Carradine is exactly the sort of actor you'd expect Quentin Tarantino to rediscover for posterity. He hails from the same B-movie background wherein languished such QT faves as Pam Grier, Robert Forster and Michael Madsen, actors with a special quality that lay largely unappreciated until Tarantino lent them renewed acclaim. Of course, thanks to his fondly remembered early-1970s TV show Kung Fu, Carradine is altogether more famous than these journeymen and women. But somehow his success on TV, although it resulted in steady work in nearly 100 movies over the years, never quite blossomed into big screen stardom. He's a household name to people over 30, but most of them know nothing of him beyond Kung Fu. This is not for lack of talent. I think Carradine discovered things in the 1960s and 1970s counterculture that interested him more than stardom, like martial arts and eastern mysticism, and he used acting as a day job to finance these pursuits and the odd personal movie project, such as his self-directed Americana (which is interesting and affecting and took eight years to edit) or You and Me (which is almost impossible to see). That said, the eldest son of the famous Hollywood studio actor John Carradine, and halfbrother of actors Keith and Bobby, has dotted his career with more than a few worthwhile projects. He had some good times with the Roger Corman crowd of the 1970s, starring in Scorsese's Boxcar Bertha and in Paul Bartel's campy Death Race 2000. Undoubtedly the pinnacle of his career was his starring role as itinerant folkie Woody Guthrie in Hal Ashby's 1976 biopic, Bound For Glory, which benefited from his considerable musical expertise and fine singing voice. He was also memorable as one of the Younger gang, alongside his brothers, in Walter Hill's landmark western The Long Riders. He does a fine line in uncredited cameos, too: he gets shot in the toilet by brother Bobby in Mean Streets, and has one deathless line as a philosophising jailbird in Altman's The Long Goodbye. With his sonorous voice, his rangy presence and his Native American features, Carradine is an instantly recognisable legend. Let's hope Tarantino does him justice. Career high: Bound For Glory, a performance that's not as widely remembered as it should be. Career low: He's made a million shitty movies, but to his Shaolin way of thinking, such distinctions aren't important. Need to know: Lived with hippy princess Barbara Hershey from 1972-75. During their time together she added the name \"Seagull\" and they named their son \"Free\". It was the times, man! The last word: On his role in Kill Bill Vol 2, after not appearing in the first movie: \"I have more lines in this movie than Hamlet had... I just talk. I'm sort of the Samuel L Jackson of this movie.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
