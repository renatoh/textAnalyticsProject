This is a guide to what they do and how your donations will be spent. Trees for Cities Since 1993, Trees for Cities has planted more than 1m trees while working with volunteers, schools and local communities to create and revitalise green spaces in socially deprived urban neighbourhoods. Its aim is to tackle global heating, create social cohesion and beautify the UK\u2019s cities. Its share of donations to the 2019 appeal will focus on two areas. The first is planting trees, woodlands and park projects in \u201cforgotten places\u201d \u2013 UK towns and cities that have historically been environmentally neglected. The second is to develop a Generation Tree programme, supporting and training individuals and community groups to create their own grassroots tree-planting projects. \u201cWe get stuck in with local communities to cultivate lasting change in their neighbourhoods \u2013 whether it\u2019s revitalising forgotten spaces, creating healthier environments or getting people excited about growing, foraging and eating healthy food,\u201d said David Elliott, Trees for Cities\u2019 chief executive. Trees for Life The Trees for Life vision is of a revitalised wild forest in the Scottish Highlands, providing space for wildlife to flourish and communities to thrive. The aim is to rewild Dundreggan, 10,000 acres of land near Loch Ness, through tree planting and natural regeneration, providing vital natural solutions in the face of the climate crisis. The restoration of the forest \u2013 which once covered most of Scotland \u2013 will help to reduce the impact of climate change by storing carbon; it will prevent flooding and soil erosion by holding back water after rain, and nurture biodiversity. Trees for Life aims to bring more people into the world of rewilding through school programmes and volunteering. \u201cWith the support of Guardian and Observer readers, hundreds of thousands of people will get the opportunity to experience and be inspired by wild nature,\u201d says the charity\u2019s chief executive, Steve Micklewright. Global Greengrants Fund UK The most effective ways of tackling environmental harm and social injustice come from people on the frontlines, says Global Greengrants Fund UK, which since 2013 has supported nearly 400 grassroots organisations working to protect the planet. Global Greengrants Fund UK will serve as an intermediary for the Guardian and Observer\u2019s 2019 appeal, using its extensive networks of expert advisers and partners in the Amazon region to distribute its share of appeal donations to local groups campaigning on climate justice, rights to land, water and resources and women\u2019s environmental action. \u201cStrengthening indigenous and local community land rights is key for forest protection in the Amazon. It is crucially important to tackle the global aspects of climate change on a rainforest that provides one-fifth of the world\u2019s oxygen,\u201d says Eva Rehse, Global Greengrants Fund UK executive director. Woodland Trust The vision of the UK\u2019s largest woodland conservation charity, Woodland Trust, is of a UK rich in native woods and trees for people and wildlife. Together with its 500,000 members and supporters it has planted nearly 50m trees and hundreds of new woods over the past five decades, and saved thousands of threatened woods. Its share of the appeal donations will help it to continue its programme of woodland expansion across the UK, providing free trees for communities and schools while creating new woodland sites free for people to enjoy and engage adults and children, and help to keep our woods free for people to enjoy. \u201cWe can\u2019t achieve the levels of woodland creation and protection to fight back against climate change and tackle nature decline on our own,\u201d said Darren Moorcroft, the Woodland Trust chief executive. \u201cWe want to continue to create havens for wildlife by planting millions of trees every year, campaign for new laws to protect ancient woodland and restore damaged ancient woods so they can breathe again and be safe for the public to enjoy for years to come. \u201cTogether we can achieve it and we are delighted that the Guardian has chosen us to be one of the Christmas appeal partners.\u201d Please donate to our appeal here"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
