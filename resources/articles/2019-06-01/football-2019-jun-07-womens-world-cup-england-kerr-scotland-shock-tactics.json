It makes for a scenically dramatic landing but the sense of excitement experienced by passengers pales into insignificance next to that of Phil Neville\u2019s and Shelley Kerr\u2019s players as they embark on the final approach towards their opening World Cup game here on Sunday. While Scotland are playing in their first World Cup, England aim to improve on the bronze medal they won four years ago in Canada and Neville\u2019s prescription for glory involves his Lionesses playing with smiles on their faces. The rapport between coach and players is so strong that Nikita Parris, the England forward who has just left Manchester City for Lyon, has even had the audacity to slip salt into her manager\u2019s tea. \u201cPhil took a big sip, spat it out like \u2018Urghh\u2019 and said: \u2018Was that you?\u2019 He knew immediately it would be me,\u201d said Parris. \u201cI like to play tricks and I\u2019d say that was my best one. We\u2019ve got a relaxed environment. We\u2019re like a family.\u201d Neville clarifies game plans during 6am runs along the sea front, watching the waves crash on the pebbly shoreline, but his players prefer sitting in the impromptu cinema they have set up in the team\u2019s medical room with eyes glued to the latest episodes of Love Island. The latest instalment of their rivalry with Scotland is likely to be somewhat different from the 6-0 thrashing England dished out in Utrecht in the opening game of Euro 2017. Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s involvement in the national team has proved a catalytic game changer, with the first minister facilitating six-month sabbaticals from work for Kerr\u2019s part-time contingent. Scotland\u2019s fitness has, consequently, improved dramatically and a squad featuring world-class individuals including Arsenal\u2019s Kim Little and Chelsea\u2019s Erin Cuthbert in addition to high-calibre semi-professionals such as the Glasgow City left-back Nicola Docherty appears fully bonded. Neville holds Kerr, previously in charge of Arsenal, in the highest regard as a tactician and a manager of people. Kerr is, in one sense, as down to earth as they come but it is no exaggeration to say the 49-year-old possesses that certain, almost undefinable, aura shared by all top-class coaches. Her superior communication skills are augmented by what is described as a mercifully rarely used yet terrifying thousand-yard stare. Whereas England\u2019s manager opted to cancel training on Friday and offered his side a day off, Kerr\u2019s players limbered up in the foothills that tumble down above the city before talking tactics at \u201cdevil in the detail\u201d team meetings. It seemed a case of horses for courses but Leah Williamson endorsed Neville\u2019s decision to remove his foot from the accelerator. \u201cAfter training on Thursday everyone felt really confident and had a good feeling, so sometimes it\u2019s best to leave it at that,\u201d said the Arsenal defender. \u201cWe\u2019re all here to enjoy ourselves and that\u2019s Phil\u2019s main message. He says these are the best days of our lives and it would be a shame to waste them with stressing. We\u2019ve got so many characters in the team that, even when we\u2019re working, we\u2019re still having fun.\u201d Williamson was talking in a casino \u2013 in the quiet of early afternoon it should be emphasised \u2013 but no gambles have been taken with the safety of England players who, for security reasons, have generally remained within the precincts of their hotel and its private beach during downtime. It was different at Canada 2015 and Euro 2017 but fans wandering around Nice\u2019s old town are unlikely to bump into a window-shopping or coffee-sipping Lioness. With Scotland adopting a similar policy \u2013 not to mention sharing the Love Island addiction \u2013 the two squads have not met up here but they know each other inside out. Williamson is unsure whether such familiarity is a plus or a minus. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we got drawn out of the hat in the same group,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bizarre one. For fans it\u2019s definitely a good thing but, for us, I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d She has equipped Neville with a verbal dossier on her Arsenal teammate Little. \u201cI\u2019ve highlighted a few of her tricks, odd little things,\u201d she said. \u201cBut Kim\u2019s world-class.\u201d Parris, like Williamson, is playing in her first World Cup finals and accepts success will not come lightly. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have ups and downs along the way,\u201d she said. \u201cWe might not always like it but, at times, we\u2019re going to have to be prepared to be honest with each other. The girls who got a bronze medal in Canada said it was the hardest thing they\u2019ve ever done. So now we\u2019re going for gold, it\u2019s going to be difficult. Nobody\u2019s going to give us the World Cup; nobody\u2019s going to give us an easy game.\u201d Scotland will certainly not. \u201cOn paper we\u2019ve bridged the gap with England,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cBut now we\u2019ve got to bridge it where it counts, on the field. We\u2019ve already captivated our nation by qualifying \u2013 now we must ensure the legacy. We don\u2019t want this to be an isolated incident.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
