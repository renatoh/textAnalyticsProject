The IOC's president, Jacques Rogge, has recently taken a lead in attempting to tackle the global issue of match-fixing and corruption, which have been most prevalent in football, snooker and cricket but which he believes also poses a threat to the Olympics. Rogge has claimed that the problem is as much of a threat to sport's future as doping, and has convened a series of summits to agree a plan of action, involving sports ministers from around the world, including Britain's Hugh Robertson, and Interpol. \"It is a world problem and it is a very pernicious problem. With the introduction of broadband, you can bet worldwide,\" Rogge told the Guardian last month. \"The danger is that from illegal betting comes match-fixing and you see more and more attempts to manipulate matches. It is as dangerous as doping for the credibility of sport. It's only the beginning of a huge battle.\" John Penrose, the government minister with responsibilty for gambling, is expected to unveil proposed changes to the Gambling Act on Wednesday, which will add the IOC and other international governing bodies to the list of those covered by the legislation. It will allow the Gambling Commission, given added responsibility for policing sports corruption in the wake of a review overseen by Liverpool FC's former chief executive Rick Parry last year, to share information from the police and law enforcement agencies. Bookmakers are legally obliged under the terms of their Gambling Commission licence to alert the authorities if they detect any suspicious betting patterns. The Gambling Commission can also share evidence collected by police, including telephone records and witness statements. The existing list chiefly covers domestic governing bodies but will be expanded to include the IOC, the International Cricket Council, Uefa, Fifa, the International Tennis Federation, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association and the International Rugby Board. Under a separate move that will require new primary legislation, the government has also promised to require offshore bookmakers offering bets in the UK to be licensed by the Gambling Commission. That will also bring them under the act and require them to share information. Uefa's president, Michel Platini, has pledged to tackle the issue in football following a spate of arrests across Europe. Rogge said last month that Olympic athletes could be tempted to cheat because many may not be as well paid as those in other sports. \"That is the reality we have to live with. We are going to monitor the London Games very closely,\" he said. \"We will make inquiries and also ask the support of the police. The arsenal is there. I hope we don't have to use it.\" The rapid pace of technological change that has facilitated a global market, huge illegal betting markets in Asia, and the rewards on offer for those tempted to cheat, have combined to make the threat of match-fixing and betting corruption a huge issue for sports governing bodies. The problem made headlines last year when the Pakistan cricketers Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Asif and Salman Butt were found guilty by the ICC of agreeing to bowl no-balls at specific points during the third Test against England at Lord's."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
