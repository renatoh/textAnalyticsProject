It's so easy to be oppositional. Politically, it's really all I know. But now, it's happened. Last night, I listened to Barack Obama and felt joy and pride and no knots at all. Cenk Uygur puts it well: \"I figured out why I was so relieved tonight. It's because I have spent the last six years \u2026 on pins and needles that we were going to lose America and do tremendous damage to the world.\" But, he points out, we didn't lose America. Overnight, a country changed. It's really a stunning thing. Hope did get us here. A progressive blogger I respect explained her role clearly: \"I'm an advocate,\" she said. She's not a journalist. I co-opted this line, and it has recently allowed me to write, always, with furthering the Obama agenda in mind. We just had to win. And then last week someone asked me, well what do you do when Obama's in the White House? Are you still such an uncritical advocate then? And so now a mini-generation must go from uncritical advocates to watchful observers. Politics is politics, and Obama will show feet of clay. Lord knows the Congress will, like instantly. What happens when promises don't come true? When do bloggers stop celebrating and start sharpening their knives for their own party? Another thing I think is very telling is the race question this morning. When pundits and journalists dissected Hillary Clinton's candidacy, it became all about her stature as the first serious woman candidate for president. She didn't run as a woman, per se, but in hindsight, she was synecdoche for \"female politician\". Similarly, in this morning's headlines, Obama's race is mentioned in each subhead. The New York Times: \"Racial barrier falls in decisive victory.\" Last night, CNN cut to many African-American crowds and focused on the historic angle that Obama is the first black president. I don't deny the import of this, and as a white woman, perhaps I can't even grasp its significance. But I didn't vote for Obama because he is black. Crowds in the streets last night didn't cheer just because Obama is the first black president. He is about so many other things. He can't yet become a symbol, because there is too much work to be done."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
