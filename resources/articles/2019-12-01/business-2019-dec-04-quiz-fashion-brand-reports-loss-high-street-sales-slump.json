Quiz, which operates 246 UK stores and concessions, reported a year-on-year sales slump of 11% across its UK retail estate in the six months to the end of September. The share price of Quiz, which reported a \u00a33.8m profit in the same period last year, slumped by 16% in early trading. The company said: \u201cThe trading conditions on the UK high street have remained very challenging. A continued reduction in footfall across the group\u2019s standalone stores and concessions have resulted in a sustained and weaker than initially anticipated negative like-for-like [sales] performance.\u201d The high street sales slump prompted Quiz to review its UK retail estate and take a \u00a37m non-cash charge to take into account issues such as onerous leases until it has a chance to renegotiate terms or shut stores. \u201cWe anticipate that we will continue to operate a number of these stores after the expiry of their existing lease terms,\u201d the company said. Quiz said that over the next two years it would have the opportunity to renegotiate or terminate leases for 50% of its UK stores. The company said the average lease length on its stores was 26 months. Emma-Lou Montgomery, an associate director at Fidelity Personal Investing, said: \u201cIt looks like up to half may close. In the meantime, they will just be an additional cost that the group could do without.\u201d The retailer blamed the continuing shift to shopping online for its ailing performance on the high street. Tarak Ramzan, the Quiz chief executive, said: \u201cThe exceptional charge incurred in relation to store impairments and onerous leases is partially attributable to the structural shifts whereby consumers are increasingly shopping online.\u201d Quiz\u2019s UK retail estate is made up of 75 stores and 171 concessions. The company, which has already said it intends to shut 20 concessions during this financial year, opened two new stores in the six-month reporting period but has said it would not open any more. \u201cThere are no current plans to open further stores and future openings will only be considered if the terms of the lease and the associated property costs ensure that the store can be expected to trade profitably,\u201d the company said. Ramzan said its focus on expanding internationally and growing the Quiz online business, where revenues increased by 7% to \u00a320m, would help drive the business back to profitability. \u201cWe have a clear customer focus, a healthy brand and a flexible model that the board believes will enable Quiz to adapt to the changing retail environment and return to profitable growth in the medium term,\u201d he said. However, analysts were not impressed that Quiz\u2019s online performance remained flat year on year. John Moore, a senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: \u201cThese results are a bit of a nightmare before Christmas for Quiz. \u201cRevenue decreases at its bricks and mortar offering is not a particular shock. However, flat online revenue to mitigate that loss is a shock and disappointment. The City has been worried about Quiz for some time now and today\u2019s figures will do little to ease those concerns.\u201d The company said it was banking on the Christmas trading period and there had been a positive response to its recent product ranges. Quiz will be hoping for a better festive season than last year, when weaker than expected sales prompted a profit warning in January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
