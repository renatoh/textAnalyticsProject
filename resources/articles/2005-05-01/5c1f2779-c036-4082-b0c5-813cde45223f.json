He conceded that due diligence disclosures by Allied had been limited, but added that they were sufficient for Pernod to construct its bid, which it is pursuing jointly with US group Fortune Brands. Pernod reported better than expected sales for the first three months of 2005, up 7% at \u20ac752m. Highlights included strong growth in China and a 45% sales volume increase in Pernod's Jacob's Creek Australian wine range in the UK, albeit at lower margins. A 1.8% decline in US volumes was disappointing, but Mr Burrows stressed it was due to one-off pricing and marketing changes on Seagram's gin last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
