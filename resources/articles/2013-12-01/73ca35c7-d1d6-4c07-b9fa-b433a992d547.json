But, much as I admire the musical's good intentions and professional skill, Lloyd Webber's instinctive romanticism sits oddly with a social and political critique. The book and lyrics by Christopher Hampton and Don Black leave us in no doubt as to the show's stance. We first see Ward gazing at a replica of himself in the Blackpool Chamber of Horrors and performing the song Human Sacrifice. And we backtrack to see how Ward enjoyed manipulating the great and not-so-good and first introduced Christine Keeler to the secretary of state for war, John Profumo, at a Cliveden party in 1961. Their affair might have been forgotten but for the fact that Keeler was also involved with a Soviet naval attache and was later violently attacked by a jealous lover. When all this came out in 1963, society found a scapegoat in Ward who was tried for pimping and took his life before a verdict could be pronounced. Inevitably a lot of the show is taken up with recounting past events. This gives Lloyd Webber scope to come up with nifty pastiche songs in the style of the early 1960s. There's an evocation of nightclub tackiness in Super-Duper Hula-Hooper, a nod towards rhythm and blues in Black-Hearted Woman and a re-creation of high life debauchery in a lewd chorale which tells us \"You've Never Had It So Good, You've Never Had It So Often.\" This last number, neatly choreographed by Stephen Mear and well staged by Richard Eyre, recalls the salacious stories of the time about a masked man in a lace pinny said to be a minister of the crown. But, if the show is intended as a blistering attack on the British Establishment's victimisation of Stephen Ward, it is only partly successful. Alexander Hanson plays Ward excellently as a suave fixer who enjoyed knowing everyone and even imagining that he was a vital conduit for MI5. But, for all Hanson's commanding presence, we never get to fully understand Ward's character: his sexuality, given his strangely platonic relationship with Keeler, remains a mystery. And when, at the climax, he belts out a big Lloyd Webber number, Too Close to the Flame, you feel he's become the victim of musical rhetoric as well as the judicial system. It's a story that requires the same tone of mordant irony that Kander and Ebb brought to Chicago or The Scottsboro Boys. But Lloyd Webber's great gift is for exploring fulfilled or thwarted desire; which is why much the best song here is a painfully moving ballad, I'm Hopeless When it Comes to You, which Joanna Riding as Profumo's obdurately loyal wife sings to her errant husband. For the most part this is a musical in which technical proficiency outweighs retrospective anger. Eyre directs it well on a revolving Rob Howell set that gives us a whistlestop tour of the 60s. Charlotte Spencer looks good as Keeler without ever suggesting she was half as much fun as her pal, Mandy Rice-Davies, whom Charlotte Blackledge endows with a bubbling bounciness. Daniel Flynn as the adulterous Profumo and Anthony Calf as Cliveden's aristocratic owner do all that is required but the show undeniably belongs to Hanson as Ward. And it is not his fault if we feel that this story of the breaking of a social butterfly on a wheel needs a melodic astringency that is not exactly Lloyd Webber's forte. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 December 2013.
