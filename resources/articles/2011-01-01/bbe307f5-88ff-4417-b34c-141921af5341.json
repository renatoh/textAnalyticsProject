They know it's a real question. You can hear the anxiety in their voices as Nick Clegg, Simon Hughes and others insist they are staying together, staying true, staying put. If it was so certain they wouldn't need to keep saying it. For the longer the coalition goes on, the more they seem to be two parties, not one. There is the coalition liberal party, which has a coherent world-view and programme. It is centred round Clegg, Danny Alexander and David Laws. It emphasises suspicion of the big-spending state and finds common ground with the Conservatives on the economy. I am not saying they are Tories themselves \u2013 they disagree about Europe, certainly, and civil liberties, often \u2013 but they are comfortable with David Cameron, and want him to succeed. Then there is the left-liberal or social democrat party, which claims the allegiance of Hughes, former leaders Menzies Campbell and Charles Kennedy, rising star Tim Farron and probably poor Vince Cable. These people are miserable about propping up Tory Thatcherites, yearn for an alternative strategy and share Labour instincts about fairness, spending and cuts. Cable's ill-advised words about taking on Rupert Murdoch, which cost him part of his department, were a private scream of pain. The coalitionist liberals and the left-liberals sound alike when they are criticising the Brown and Blair years; they almost all hated the Iraq war, the suspension of old liberties and the over-centralisation of policy-making. But the two sides of the Lib Dems are not alike when it comes to the future. It is now perfectly possible that the Lib Dems may have to split. The Oldham East and Saddleworth byelection explains why. The Lib Dem candidate kept his share of the vote only because Tories flocked to support him. It would be the same the other way around in areas where the Tories are stronger. Interviewing the Tory MP Mark Pritchard, secretary of the 1922 backbenchers' committee, for Radio 4's Week in Westminster, I was startled to hear him acknowledging the logic of it: he may hate the so-called \"purple plotters\" who would like to fuse the Tory and Lib Dem parties, but he'd like to see \"closer co-operation\" between Tories and Lib Dems in every byelection. In other words, the coalition party with the lesser chance should soft-pedal. Then Chris Davies, the Lib Dem who won the old Littleborough and Saddleworth byelection in 1995 and is now an MEP, passionately burst out that this was impossible. Any such suggestion would split the Lib Dems; nobody could countenance it. Why so hot under the collar? Because left-liberals can't stand what is happening. As the party slumps in the polls it needs Conservative life-support tubes. Dr Cameron is happy to oblige, because it suits him. But life gets harder for the social democratic liberals as the embrace gets tighter. Meanwhile, across the Commons divide, Labour is appealing ever more directly to them. Douglas Alexander, speaking at the weekend Fabian conference on the same platform as Hughes, put it well when he described the pain of Lib Dems today: they see themselves as part of the centre-left project, but are inside a centre-right administration. He rightly warned they would be judged on what they did, not what they said. A similar message came from Ed Miliband yesterday. What strikes me most about his positioning is how much easier it makes things for Lib Dem defectors. Miliband talks about defending local communities; about learning the lessons of an over-managerial state; and about Labour's failures in regulating the City. He is also the most pro-green and civil libertarian leader Labour has had. It simply isn't true that he is offering no new direction for the party: slowly but steadily he is repositioning Labour away from Brown-Blairism in ways which the decentralising, liberal left ought to appreciate. That old veteran of the SDP, David Owen, told the BBC's Politics Show today that he might rejoin the party, and certainly hopes to vote Labour, now that it is a social democratic party. At the same time, he showered praise on Miliband. The instincts of the Hughes-Kennedy brand of Lib Dems could well be sorely tempted by further Labour repositioning under Miliband. The Labour leader isn't sounding tribal \u2013 though I thought his patronising offer to work with Clegg only if he \"repented\" was about encouraging a split rather than being genuine. Miliband has, though, offered to share a platform with Clegg on the alternative vote referendum, the next fascinating dilemma for centre-left politicians. It is beginning to look as if Labour peers, led by Lord Falconer, could wreck government plans for a spring referendum by insisting on detailed scrutiny in the Lords \u2013 where time is running out. Almost every aspect of this bill is weird. The Lib Dems have made winning the referendum into a fetish, a symbol they have \"got something\" out of the coalition. Yet it is not really a proportional voting system, and many psephologists think it might actually disadvantage the Lib Dems. The Labour case against the bill is a strong one, which ought to appeal to Lib Dem traditions of localism: they say it is unfair to spatchcock the boundary changes and reduction of parliamentary seats on to the referendum, putting the two together in one bill. These changes are being imposed with Maoist speed and will break up many natural communities in the interest of arithmetic, slicing across estuaries, adding islands to blobs of the mainland, and destroying the identity of old constituencies. Worse, the formula seems to mean the perpetual redrawing of boundaries. Most people assume that the raw politics of the boundary changes is simply to squeeze Labour. If so, think again: a survey by the Democracy Audit suggests Labour would indeed lose more MPs, about 25, but that the Lib Dems, with a far smaller Commons party, would lose at least seven (and the Tories 13). If AV does not, after all, strongly boost Lib Dem representation, this looks like \u2013 at best \u2013 a neutral change for them. Is it really Clegg's trump card? A truly cynical Labour policy might be to encourage the AV referendum to go forward, because it would be a vote about Clegg and would be lost, provoking a Lib Dem crisis and a split. But Miliband does not have to stoop so low. The centre ground is shifting; as Lib Dem radicals follow the logic and their voters, they are moving his way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
