It\u2019s a question some of the world\u2019s greatest minds have patiently pondered. When Marilyn Monroe was photographed with a copy of James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses in 1955, for example, it sparked a debate about whether she had actually read all those big words. More recently, the model Emily Ratajkowski\u2019s literary predilections have caused a stir among the chattering classes. \u201cThe day I read that she was a fan of Chilean novelist Roberto Bola\u00f1o, my brain short-circuited,\u201d wrote the American cultural critic Thomas Chatterton Williams in a 2018 profile of Ratajkowski published in French Marie Claire. \u201cThe mere fact that she knew [Bola\u00f1o\u2019s] name seemed unbelievable.\u201d Why am I dredging up a celebrity profile from 2018 when it is 2020 and the world is on fire? The answer, my friends, is in the question. Also: Williams\u2019s interview belatedly went viral over the weekend, and Ratajkowski herself weighed in. The model, who is writing a book of essays about \u201cwhat it means to be a model and a commodity\u201d, summed up her overall reaction to Williams\u2019s work with an about-to-puke emoji. \u201cI really hope this will be the last of my \u2018she has breasts AND claims to read\u2019 profiles/interviews,\u201d she tweeted. Ah yes, we haven\u2019t got to the breast bit yet. Williams is obsessed with Ratajkowski\u2019s cleavage; he describes her as having the \u201cmost perfect breasts of her generation\u201d. He marvels at her articulating an \u201cintelligent response\u201d to a question while wearing an \u201cextraordinarily deep neckline without a bra, all the while seeming to know, deep down, just how absurd and confusing \u2026 such an outfit looks with everything she\u2019s saying\u201d. But don\u2019t worry, Williams isn\u2019t entirely distracted by her sexuality, which he describes as \u201comnipotent and animal\u201d. He generously notes that it \u201cmight sound silly to say this \u2026 but she seems truly authentic\u201d. The entire profile is a masterclass in creepy condescension. To be fair, Williams didn\u2019t write the profile alone. The commission was originally given to his wife, Valentine Faure, but she let him fly to Cap d\u2019Antibes and do the interview because, he explains, she thought he\u2019d \u201cenjoy it more\u201d. His wife contributes to the piece but the really awful bits belong to Williams. He can take some solace in the fact that his profile isn\u2019t the worst thing that has ever been written by a pompous man about a famous woman. To give Williams his due, he didn\u2019t compare EmRata to a baby cat, unlike Thomas B Morgan, who described Brigitte Bardot as a \u201csassy kitten\u201d in a 1960 profile. Or the writer Rich Cohen, who began a 1995 Rolling Stone profile of Alicia Silverstone by describing her as a \u201ckittenish 18-year-old movie star whom lots of men want to sleep with\u201d. Other classics of the Creepy Interview Dude genre include Stephen Marche\u2019s 2013 Esquire profile of Megan Fox; he describes her as \u201ca sexual prop used to sell movies and jeans\u201d. And Art Tavana\u2019s 2016 LA Weekly piece about the musician Sky Ferreira: he likens her to \u201ca freshly licked lollipop\u201d and compares her breasts to Madonna\u2019s \u201cdefiantly atomic boobs\u201d. I could go on; there are gazillions of these examples. However, I think we are all suffering enough. So, to return to the original question: yes, you can read books when you have breasts. But I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s possible for some men to write about women without making complete tits of themselves. \u2022 Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
