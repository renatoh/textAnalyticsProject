Begovic made it clear he wanted to move on this summer and Chelsea had long identified the Bosnian as the man they wanted to take over from Petr Cech as deputy for Thibaut Courtois. After rejecting an earlier bid from Chelsea, Stoke accepted the Premier League champions\u2019 increased offer and the only hold-up related to the player that would move on loan to the Britannia Stadium as part of the transfer. Van Ginkel, who had been linked with Sunderland, Newcastle and Southampton, is believed to be that man. Stoke were backed into a corner with Begovic once contract talks broke off with the 28-year-old, who had only 12 months remaining on his deal. The Midlands club is entitled to be satisfied, however, with the \u00a38m fee it has received and in particular the acquisition of Van Ginkel. A 22-year-old Holland international who spent last season on loan at Milan, Van Ginkel will help to fill the void left by Steven Nzonzi\u2019s transfer to Sevilla. Begovic\u2019s departure at Stoke is offset by the arrival of Shay Given, who was about to sign for Middlesbrough until the Premier League club turned his head at the last minute. Given, now 39, underwent a medical at Stoke on Thursday and is set to sign a two-year contract. Jack Butland, the England Under-21 international, will start the season as Stoke\u2019s No1."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
