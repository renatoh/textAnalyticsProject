Cleveland police officer Timothy Loehmann told grand jurors he shot because Tamir pulled a gun \u2013 which turned out to be a pellet gun \u2013 from his waistband. \u201cThe suspect had a gun, had been threatening others with the weapon and had not obeyed our command to show us his hands,\u201d he said. Loehmann fatally shot Tamir, who was black, within two seconds of arriving at a local park on 22 November last year, after a 911 caller reported that there was a juvenile in the area with a weapon that was \u201cprobably fake\u201d. The full details of the call were not passed on to the officers, according to other accounts released by the Cuyahoga County prosecutor Timothy McGinty. A Cuyahoga County grand jury is currently considering whether to bring charges against Loehmann, 27, and his partner, 47-year-old Frank Garmback, both of whom are white. Garmback was the driver of the patrol car on the day of the shooting. The officers, who had previously declined to be interviewed by county investigators, provided written testimony that was released by prosecutors after being read to grand jurors on Tuesday. Loehmann said he told Tamir to raise his hands repeatedly as the boy was \u201creaching into his waistband\u201d before the officer opened fire and had exited his patrol cruiser because he had been trained that \u201cthe cruiser is a coffin\u201d. \u201cI observed the suspect pulling the gun out of waistband and his elbow coming up,\u201d Loehmann wrote in his submission, dated 30 November 2015. He continued: \u201cWith his hands pulling the gun out and his elbow coming up, I knew it was a gun and it was coming out \u2026 the threat to my partner and myself was real and active.\u201d Lawyers for the Rice family have repeatedly dismissed claims that Loehmann and Garmback could have given the 12-year-old sufficient warnings or commands, given the fraction of time that passed between the officers arriving on the scene and opening fire. On Tuesday, Rice family lawyers described the prosecutor\u2019s decision to allow the officer\u2019s unsworn statements before the grand jury as \u201ca stunning irregularity\u201d. \u201cNo regular target of a criminal investigation would be afforded this opportunity,\u201d the group said in a statement. In Garmback\u2019s statement, he concedes that the patrol car had slid along the ground and \u201cdid not stop where and when I intended\u201d. The steady release of evidence presented to the grand jury, including three expert testimonies that concluded the shooting was justified, has been staunchly criticised by Tamir\u2019s parents and protesters in Cleveland, who argue that the drip feed of information is designed to prepare the public for a non-indictment. Rice family lawyers have requested the grand jury also hear testimony from two experts who concluded the shooting was not justified. Asked for a statement on the officers\u2019 behalf, their attorney, Henry Hiler, said in an email on Tuesday: \u201cWe respect the grand jury process and have faith in our judicial system.\u201d The officers\u2019 statements were read to the jurors a day after Tamir\u2019s mother, Samaria, testified to the panel about the loss of her son. In a statement, her attorney said she had asked the jurors whether the officers\u2019 actions \u201ccould possibly be \u2018reasonable\u2019 or \u2018justifiable\u2019\u201d. \u201cShe believes that the answer is plainly no,\u201d the statement said, \u201cand hopes and prays that the grand jury agrees that there is probable cause to indict the officers and hold them accountable for her son\u2019s death.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
