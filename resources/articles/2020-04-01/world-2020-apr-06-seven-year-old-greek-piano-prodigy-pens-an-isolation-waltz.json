A seven-year-old Greek prodigy has penned an \u201cisolation waltz\u201d inspired by the pandemic. The hypnotic, fugue-like melody has picked up more than 43,000 hits on YouTube since its launch last week. \u201cHi guys! I\u2019m Stelios. Let\u2019s be just a teeny bit more patient and we will soon be out swimming in the sea,\u201d he beams, perched on his piano stool, feet barely touching the floor. \u201cI\u2019m dedicating to you a piece of my own.\u201d The work, his third composition, was written especially \u201cfor people who suffer and those who isolate because of Covid-19,\u201d he adds. Born in Athens in 2012 to Fotis and Agathe Kerasidis, both pianists who now teach him, Stelios first performed in public at the age of three. In 2018 he played Chopin\u2019s Waltz in A Minor at New York\u2019s Carnegie Hall, and last year he appeared at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall performing on Elton John\u2019s famous red piano. Stelios says his favourite pianist is the late Canadian Glenn Gould, best known for his technically demanding renditions of Bach variations. The Greek has shown a flare for composing. His two earlier works were written for his sisters, Veronica and Anastasia, and like Isolation Waltz were met with critical acclaim. Greece has been under lockdown for longer than most other European nations, the government having closed schools almost a month ago. Last week the government announced that swimming was also forbidden as the measures were ramped up. The precautionary steps appear to be working: Greece has reported 79 deaths and fewer than 1,800 confirmed coronavirus cases, far fewer than some other countries. Stelios, who is likely to be homebound for some time yet, has not hinted whether he has another composition up his sleeve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
