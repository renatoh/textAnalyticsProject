At the moment, foxtons.co.uk estate agents. I am looking for a house and the way the site is designed really understands the needs of someone looking for a property. I also enjoy Habitat - it manages to present the products in a charming and fluid way and uses flash technology very well - the only weakness is that you cannot buy the products online. Last online purchase? Flowers for Valentine's day - 12 red roses from M&amp;S saved my life. Ever been in a chat room? No. I prefer to deal with people face to face - it's easier to tell if they are lying or not. Most recent technological faux pas? I borrowed a laptop to go to a pitch and couldn't find the \"on\" button. The client had to point it out to me. Main news source on the web? The BBC - I just identify with the brand and it's the one I am comfortable with. Most useful website? I think thisismoney.com is a fantastic site. The ability to compare hundreds of savings accounts and mortgages is saving me a fortune. It is appallingly designed but, from a functional point of view, it is the most useful site I have come across for managing your own finances and giving you independent advice. Least useful website? Enormicom.com. I suppose you have to be a designer to appreciate it as it takes a satirical look at the lack of imagination of many digital businesses. It's all very tongue in cheek. Most irritating thing about the internet? Self-indulgent flash designs are a pet hate, and pop-up advertising. Sites that fail to realise people who use this medium are in control and choose to engage with a brand online. If you try to interfere with their control, you lose trust for the brand. What type of online business is least likely to succeed? Those that don't have a fundamentally good idea and visionary leadership by someone who is passionate about what their business does, and who understands it. When accountants start running businesses, they tend to fail. Money is the byproduct of a vision as opposed to the sole reason for being in business. Do you still bother with old media? I read the Times and Men's Health. I try not to make a distinction between old and new media. \u00b7 Paul Brooks is head of digital creative at LIDA, a direct and digital marketing company"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
