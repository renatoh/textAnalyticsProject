Today's launch of the lifelong learning strategy, ahead of the May Scottish Parliament elections, also announced the revival of individual learning accounts, which were abandoned last year after widespread fraud in England. Enterprise and lifelong learning minister Iain Gray said education maintenance allowances would be introduced to help an estimated 40,000 young people stay on at school or college. Business learning accounts will be piloted among small businesses so they can link training needs with business growth. Learning was the key to unlocking the door to success for individuals and the country as a whole, said Mr Gray. \"In order to achieve a smart, successful Scotland we have to make sure that every Scot is given the opportunity to be the very best that they can be. Learning is key to this. \"This new strategy recognises the crucially important role that learning plays in the future economic prosperity of Scotland. It sets out a clear agenda for matching learning opportunities with the skills needed to strengthen Scotland's economy and society,\" he added. In schools, \u00a340m a year will be spent by 2006 to enable young people to experience business enterprise, and \"pre-apprenticeships\" will be linked with vocational learning in schools. Mr Gray added: \"Learning - gaining new skills and new knowledge - is a lifetime opportunity and a lifetime achievement. Different types of learning help people to develop their potential in different ways; from accessing jobs and careers that may have seemed out of their reach to fostering new interests that enrich their lives.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
