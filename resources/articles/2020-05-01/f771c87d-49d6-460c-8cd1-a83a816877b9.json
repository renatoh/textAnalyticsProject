Attorneys for both men said on Friday that witnesses had signed affidavits maintaining that the two NFL players took no part in an alleged armed robbery on Wednesday night in Miramar, Florida. Cohen said on Saturday that police had treated Baker fairly but that there was more to the story than authorities had been told. \u201cBoth my client and I have felt @miramarpd and the Detective working the case, were accommodating and went out of their way to assure Mr Bakers privacy during this hard time,\u201d Cohen\u2019s statement read. \u201cThat is not just lip service, it is fact, and we appreciate it. This is my 23rd year in practice defending those who I feel are wrongly charged or wrongly treated. That doesn\u2019t mean that all police officers are bad or all are good. We all have jobs to do and I believe we all do them to the best of our ability. \u201cPolice reports are just that, reports of what was told to them or said to them. Court is what we use to then examine those reports, investigate those claims and allow the Defendant an opportunity to confront the evidence. Don\u2019t rush to judgement.\u201d Dunbar\u2019s lawyer, Michael Grieco, said his client is innocent. \u201cNobody is running from this,\u201d Grieco said. \u201cMy client is innocent. I don\u2019t want him to do a minute in jail for this.\u201d According to the arrest warrant, Baker and Dunbar were attending a cookout at a Miramar home on Wednesday night when a fight broke out, and Baker pulled out a handgun. Baker, Dunbar and two other men then allegedly began robbing other people at the party of thousands of dollars in cash, watches and other valuables."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
