But not as big a shock as his announcement that he plans to carry on as prime minister for another five years ... \"For months there has been speculation, gossip and rumour about when Mr Blair would go ... Now he has revealed his exit strategy. He aims to continue to serve right through the next parliamentary term and only hand over as the following election approaches. That would give him at least five more years in No 10. And who knows what the political landscape will be like then ... \"His health might not allow him to [carry on] ... There will also be tensions within the government as ministers jostle for position in the race to be his successor. If Mr Blair makes the full five years he will have beaten the record of Margaret Thatcher, who managed 11 and a half. He will want that but, unlike her, he will also want to manage an orderly handover.\" Daily Telegraph Editorial, October 1 \"Mr Blair's heart operation, together with his decision to step down at the end of the next parliament, is an earthquake which will alter the landscape of British politics ... The countdown to the transition of power begins today ... At the next general election, the electorate will know that the man it is being asked to confirm in office will, at some unspecified date, cease to be prime minister, probably sooner rather than later. Mr Blair is now a lame duck. \"This is a profoundly disturbing situation for a country engaged in a global war on terrorism, committed to a peacekeeping role in Iraq, in neither case with any end yet in sight. Mr Blair's continuation in office is by no means a necessary condition for the successful continuation of this conflict, but any abrupt change in leadership is liable to have an unsettling impact on the morale of the armed forces and the nation. Hence, there is a need for calm and continuity. Those who are jockeying to replace him would be wise to conduct themselves discreetly, or they will be punished at the polls.\" Peter Mandelson Evening Standard, London, October 1 \"The announcement about his future ... shows maturity on his part, as well as some courage. Others in his position would have feared that they would be turned into a lame duck by saying when they planned to retire from the top job. Mrs Thatcher made a great mistake by refusing to acknowledge her own mortality. By allowing everyone to think she was prepared to go on and on, she drove the public and then her own cabinet into despair ... \"Mr Blair has deftly removed himself from the risk of history repeating itself. No one can now accuse him of 'doing a Thatcher'. Instead, if he is re-elected, he will be able to govern in relative calm, no doubt facing many tough pressures and difficult events but without these being accompanied by the sort of jostling we have seen during a lot of this year.\" James Blitz Financial Times, October 1 \"The sight of a prime minister effectively announcing that he will stay in Downing Street until a specified date around four years hence - and then stand down - is simply unprecedented in British politics. Even the prime minister's closest acolytes believe he does not really intend to do such a thing - but fear it may smack of a certain arrogance. \"Mr Blair's inner determination to stay on, of course, should not be doubted ... [and] is buttressed by numerous other factors. The Conservatives ... are still not seriously challenging to be the next government. And while Gordon Brown this week earned a strong standing ovation at the conference that re-established his position as the second figure in the government, there is a string of cabinet figures who question whether the chancellor could win over middle Britain in a general election.\" Mary Ann Sieghart Times, October 1 \"Why does he feel he needs a whole four or five more years? He will already have served for eight by the time of the next general election. Is not 12 years too long for any prime minister? ... \"Mr Blair is very fired up to finish what he has started. His second term has been somewhat of a grind, and he wants to have a chance, in a third parliament, to oversee his reforms to fruition. \"Mr Blair also believes that he is finally experienced enough now to do the job well. He has hardened in office, as he admitted in his conference speech. Whereas in his first term, the prime minister resiled from taking difficult decisions, lest they make him unpopular, he now has no such qualms - as his actions over Iraq showed. \"He knows there are hard choices to be made in the next term, particularly over pensions, welfare reform and the public services. Not having to face re-election, he would be even freer to do what he saw as the right - but possibly unpopular -thing. And increasingly, he fears that Mr Brown as prime minister would not be prepared to do so.\" Trevor Kavanagh Sun, October 1 \"Will he seize the moment and call a snap general election in November? Why not? ... Mr Blair has nothing to gain by waiting another eight months ... \"The PM is utterly convinced he can win and win easily. So why wait? Most attractive of all from Mr Blair's point of view is that it would effectively cut a year off his overall premiership while still giving him a place in the history books. And, perhaps crucially, it would give him the authority finally to shape his government in exactly the fashion he wants. \"Mr Brown could be foreign secretary by Christmas - or out of the cabinet altogether.\" John Rentoul Independent, October 1 \"My guess is that Mr Blair is keeping his options open ... He may not know whether he will want to fight the next election, but he wants to have that chance if events are kind to him ... \"The fact remains, though, that if Mr Blair resigned at any time before the election, the leadership election would resemble a coronation, despite John Prescott's insistence that 'we don't have coronations in Labour'. John Reid and Alan Milburn might want to stand to put markers down, but in order to stand they would need to be nominated by large numbers of MPs, who then might be cast into the outer darkness by the incoming prime minister. And to force Mr Brown to appoint them to important jobs, they would need to win lots of votes among MPs, party members and trade unionists.\" Daily Star Editorial, October 1 \"Let's not be naive, his wish to carry on as Labour leader for a full third term is unlikely to be realised. He's made one big mistake by trying to choose a retirement date. Admitting he will quit after that will spark off a battle for his succession. \"From today there will be only one topic of conversation among Labour MPs - who will take over from Tony. He has made himself a lame duck PM - not through his health problems but by saying: 'I'm quitting.'\" Scotsman Editorial, October 1 \"This is the second time Mr Blair has required treatment for his heart. He may well feel confident now about how long he can go on. But heart problems, particularly when there has been a recurrence, cannot be so easily dismissed, and especially given the circumstances that Mr Blair is in. \"The job of prime minister is the most stressful imaginable. It has involved particular strain over the past 18 months with the Iraq war and its traumatic political aftermath. No person in the post can convincingly maintain that such a position does not involve deep and persistent anxiety and stress. It is not likely to get less so, however much the occupant may wish it. And however robust the prime minister may feel now, he cannot possibly know what lies round the corner either on the domestic front or internationally. Fate can make a fool of the bravest of us.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
