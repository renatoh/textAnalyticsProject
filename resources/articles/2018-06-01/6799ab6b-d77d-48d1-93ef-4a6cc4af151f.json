The 22-year-old, who joined United from Monaco for \u00a336m in September 2015, has found life at Old Trafford increasingly frustrating under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, with limited opportunities from the bench. The forward was not included in France\u2019s squad for the World Cup having struggled to make much impact at United since Mourinho\u2019s arrival. On Wednesday night, his representative, Philippe Lamboley, insisted that \u201cthe time has come\u201d for the player to move on. Lamboley told RMC Sport: \u201cAfter thinking about all the factors and possibilities, Anthony wants to leave Manchester United. There are lots of factors, and right now it\u2019s too early to talk about them. Manchester United want Anthony to extend his deal and do not want him to leave but we have not reached an agreement for several months. \u201cI think that when Manchester United, the most powerful club in the world, do not find an agreement after eight months of negotiations then they do not really want to keep such an important player in their squad. That\u2019s why this decision has come \u2013 it\u2019s a well-thought-out decision. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that he is under contract and that Manchester United will have the last word. We will respect the club\u2019s decision and he will stick with his commitment to the end. \u201cAnthony is disappointed because he has shown his love for the club and the supporters for three seasons. Without the unconditional support of the fans he would have already asked to leave United. I think he has done his best for three years and it is important to remember that he scored 11 goals and made 10 assists in five months of last season. \u201cEveryone will have their opinion but I think he needs to resume his career. The time has come.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
