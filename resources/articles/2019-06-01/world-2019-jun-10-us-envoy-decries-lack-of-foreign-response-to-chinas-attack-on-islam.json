Sam Brownback, ambassador at large for international religious freedom, said some majority-Muslim states did not want to draw attention to their own human rights record. He was hopeful that the more Muslim populations around the world heard about the imprisonment of an estimated more than 1 million Uighurs, the more they will put pressure on their governments to speak out. The Trump administration has severely criticised Beijing for its campaign against Islam in Xinjiang province, western China, where more than two dozen mosques and Islamic shrines have been razed since 2016. But Washington, in the midst of a tense trade dispute with China, has yet to impose sanctions, and Brownback said he could not say whether any punitive measures were pending. Meanwhile, Washington\u2019s closest allies in the Islamic world \u2013 Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt \u2013 have been silent in the face of the mass incarceration of Muslims in Xinjiang. At the beginning of March, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation passed a resolution which praised China for \u201cproviding care to its Muslim citizens\u201d. The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has also defended China\u2019s \u201cright to carry out anti-terrorism and counter extremism work for its national security\u201d. In an interview with the Guardian, Brownback said that the US has been \u201cin discussion\u201d with Riyadh about its response to China, but did not single out the Saudis for criticism, arguing it was an issue for the whole Islamic world. He applauded Turkey for taking a outspoken approach, and \u201ca number of western countries that have spoken out aggressively on this\u201d. But Brownback, a former Kansas governor, added: \u201cI have been disappointed that more Islamic countries have not spoken out. I know the Chinese have been threatening them and but you don\u2019t back down to somebody that does that. That just encourages more actions. \u201cIf China is not stopped from doing this they\u2019re going to replicate and push this system out in their own country and to other authoritarian regimes,\u201d he said. Brownback did not specify what kind of threats China is alleged to have made, but after the Turkish foreign ministry called the incarceration of Uighurs a \u201cgreat shame for humanity\u201d, China scaled down diplomatic ties and warned of damaged economic relations. Brownback suggested another reason for reticence of some governments in the Islamic world was they felt vulnerable on their own record on religious rights. \u201cI think a number of who are concerned about their own human rights record and then they\u2019re saying look: we don\u2019t want people criticizing us [so] we\u2019re not going to criticize somebody else,\u201d he said. But Brownback said he was hopeful that governments would increasingly come under pressure from their own people to take a stand on the abuses in China. \u201cI think as more information gets out and particularly as it gets out to the population in some of these places that you\u2019ll see more of their governments act and react,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
