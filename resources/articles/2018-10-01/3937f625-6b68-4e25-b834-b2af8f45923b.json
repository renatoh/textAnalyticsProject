After all, Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s team have only two points and are desperately seeking a first win of the campaign. Reason to be fearful Despite last season\u2019s somewhat deceptive 10th-place finish, Newcastle\u2019s downward spiral started last spring. In 14 games since mid-April they have won once and lost 11 times. Lack of goals is proving corrosive but the underlying problem is recruitment; whereas some rivals spent around \u00a3100m last summer Ben\u00edtez, unhappily, made a \u00a320m profit on player trading. A skinny squad could do with a reliable central striker, a natural No 10, another decent winger, a mobile central midfielder and specialist left-back cover. Reason to be cheerful Narrow defeats against five top-six teams indicate the sense of crisis may have been exacerbated by a cruel early autumn fixture list. If Brighton represents a more realistic litmus test, so, too, do impending games against Southampton, Watford, Bournemouth and Burnley. Significantly, Ben\u00edtez possesses an excellent goalkeeper in Martin Dubravka and Jonjo Shelvey remains a gifted playmaker. \u201cThe first win is always the hardest,\u201d says Newcastle\u2019s manager. \u201cAfterwards we\u2019ll be better \u2013 you can\u2019t buy confidence on the fifth floor of John Lewis.\u201d Might Ben\u00edtez be sacked? Unlikely. Admittedly the Spaniard\u2019s refusal to extend a deal which runs out next summer has seen agents hawking their managerial clients to Newcastle but there is currently no appetite for parting company with a coach adored by supporters. \u201cI don\u2019t fear the sack,\u201d said an unusually upbeat Ben\u00edtez on Friday in response to vague suggestions that Celtic\u2019s Brendan Rodgers might replace him. \u201cIt\u2019s more difficult this year but I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll stay in the Premier League.\u201d The contractual sticking point is the owner Mike Ashley\u2019s refusal to meet Ben\u00edtez\u2019s demands over not only transfers but a proposed revamp of the training ground and academy. on Friday, though, this most politically astute manager proved to be in uncharacteristically, and intriguingly, conciliatory mood. Maybe, just maybe, the unprecedented group night out involving an Italian meal recently shared by the owner, squad and staff really has created a mood of glasnost. \u201cIf we\u2019re talking about [extending] my contract we won\u2019t tell you,\u201d Ben\u00edtez, who has met Ashley only four times, said teasingly. Could Ben\u00edtez be part of the problem? It sounds almost heretical but a few fans have begun to question the manager\u2019s perceived tactical negativity. His retort is that recent defeats were narrow \u2013 and relegation could be decided on goal difference. Moreover Newcastle regularly miss counterattacking chances. Which rather begs the question: was Ben\u00edtez right to sell Aleksandar Mitrovic to Fulham? He never trusted the Serbia striker to retain his discipline and craved Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n, now borrowed from West Brom. Is Rond\u00f3n, struggling for fitness, better than Mitrovic though? Ben\u00edtez remains excellent at improving players \u2013 Jamaal Lascelles, Paul Dummett and DeAndre Yedlin are three to have improved immeasurably on his watch \u2013 but the sense that the coach will depart next summer has possibly undermined his authority slightly, with Lascelles and Matt Ritchie recently questioning a couple of managerial decisions. Not that anyone has forgotten the tactical wonders Ben\u00edtez performed to keep Newcastle up last season. Or that he has, once again, been dealt an awful hand by Ashley. \u201cThe other teams around us spent \u00a3100m,\u201d he reiterated, before changing tack and apparently proffering a rare olive branch in the owner\u2019s direction. \u201cBut I\u2019m used to working without a big budget; even at Liverpool and Real Madrid I was never spending big money and still we were achieving something. \u201cI don\u2019t know my January budget and it\u2019s not a problem. I\u2019m not telling you this because I have to but because I see the team training. I believe. And the fans know they have to support the team for 90 minutes. This city wants to be in the Premier League next year. If you criticise the manager, the substitutions or something else it doesn\u2019t change anything. The fans have to be united.\u201d Might that be the cue for the cessation of latterly escalating anti-Ashley protests? Is the club likely to be sold soon? As Ben\u00edtez tucked into his seafood risotto during that Italian meal, Ashley revealed an imminent sale was unlikely. Yet Newcastle remain very much on the market, with the law firm hired to handle interest fielding frequent \u2013 if invariably frivolous \u2013 inquiries. With Amanda Staveley\u2019s proposed buyout having foundered, the former Manchester United and Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon hopes to form a consortium able to meet the \u00a3300m-\u00a3350m asking price and Saudi Arabian interest is also rumoured. Expect any takeover to be conducted amid utmost discretion with its eventual announcement startling almost everyone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
