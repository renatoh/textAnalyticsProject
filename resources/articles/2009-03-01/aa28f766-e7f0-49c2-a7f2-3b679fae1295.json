Although the bank failed to complete its pay review in time for the publication of the annual report today, it has already forced 15,000 of its most senior staff to spread their pay out over a number of years and required executives to increase the number of shares they own. The bank did not pay any cash bonuses or make share awards to executive directors for 2008, keeping a promise it made to its shareholders last year after a row over the way it had raised funds from Middle Eastern investors. But Sir Richard Broadbent, the independent director who chairs the remuneration committee, admitted awarding performance-related shares to finance director Chris Lucas and executive director Frits Seegers, worth \u00a3800,000 and \u00a31.6m respectively in 2009. John Varley, the chief executive, enjoyed a \u00a32.8m jump in his pension provision amounting to a total pot of \u00a312.3m, which will entitle him to an annual pension of \u00a3572,000. The group pension fund slid to a \u00a3900m deficit from a \u00a3700m surplus the year before. Varley's pay was \u00a31m, down from the \u00a34.2m he received in 2007. The pay of Bob Diamond, the Barclays president and best known for running the investment bank Barclays Capital, appeared to suffer a 99% cut in his pay to \u00a3250,000 \u2013 his basic pay. But if longer term performance plans are included, his total is bolstered to \u00a317m because was handed \u00a37.4m in cash from a three-year performance scheme that he achieved in 2007 and received a further \u00a39.7m in shares when a previous performance scheme paid out. The bank tried to demonstrate that its executives were feeling the pain of its investors whose shares have fallen from more than \u00a35 to just over \u00a31 in 12 months by highlighting a combined \u00a395m fall in the value of the shares owned by executive directors. A \u00a3298,000 bonus was paid to Gary Hoffman, the former boardroom executive who left in September to become chief executive of Northern Rock. Hoffman's pay was \u00a3724,000 for 2008. Every member of the board is standing for election at the annual meeting next month, which is an unusual gesture made after the row over the fundraising last year that ignored the pre-emption rights of existing investors. They would have been expected to be asked to buy new shares before outside investors were approached. Marcus Agius, the chairman, who faces a possible protest vote about his re-election, admitted there was a \"high level of unhappiness on the part of some shareholders that the principle of pre-emption was breached\". Agius received \u00a3750,000 last year. The bank is facing speculation that it will need to raise fresh capital and join the government's asset protection scheme. It is in talks to sell its iShares asset management arm of Barclays Global Investors, with Goldman Sachs regarded as possible suitor. Staff at the BGI arm made gains on options of more than \u00a3140m last year. Broadbent admitted the bank was yet to conclude its review of pay policies prompted by demands from the Financial Services Authority. It hopes to reveal more details at the annual meeting on 23 April following the warning by the regulator that it is not interested in just bonuses but all aspects of pay, including pensions. \"Our guiding principle throughout all decisions has been pay for performance.\" While the review continues, the remuneration policy has been rewritten to accentuate the risks being taken to achieve bonuses. Analysts expressed concern that the bank's total off-balance sheet exposure increased by 38% to \u00a3315bn last year. The shares closed 3% lower at 117p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
