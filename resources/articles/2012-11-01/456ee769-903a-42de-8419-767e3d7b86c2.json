Lingering reactionary doubts about the necessity of this ought to have been vanquished by official statistics this year that revealed that more women than men are now being ordained. In a shrinking institution, the influx of female vicars is a rare positive \u2013 a bulwark against some deep irreligious social tides. How extraordinary, then, that the General Synod is in all seriousness debating whether to retain that church roof on female ambitions, the bar on women bishops. Forty-two out of 44 dioceses have already seen sense, and resolved that the CofE should get on the right side of history, as have a majority of bishops, clergy and parishoners. Thanks to the creaking intricacies of the synod rulebook, however, success is not guaranteed. A conservative requirement for a two-thirds majority in each of three houses is part of the problem; another is the tendency \u2013 so familiar from the travails of unfashionable political parties \u2013 for important committees to get captured by obsessives. Even so, the misnamed Anglican Mainstream would stand no chance of mustering the requisite blocking minority, were it not for deficiencies within the reform measure, GS 1708D, which are so stark that some progressives feel compelled to vote against. To reconcile the irreconcilable, the draft measure allows individual churches to opt out of the care of a woman bishop, undermining both the authority of female priests and the organisational integrity of a supposedly episcopal church. The head-spinning organogram creates ambiguities and invites future rows; seeing as there can be no opt-out from the oversight of Canturbury, another silly dispute will presumably be required before a woman can reach Lambeth Palace. The reactionaries have no real guarantees, since these opt-outs could be cancelled by another synod further down the line. Even reformist males are not safe, as churches who regard their hands as being tainted by ordaining women will be able to opt out of their authority too. There is, then, truly something to offend everyone here. And that, in a nutshell, is why reform remains in doubt. Yet for a church famed for compromises to reject this particular fudge would be self-destructive. After all the wasted time, reformers would be condemned to waste still more. For their part, the conservatives would see tactical victory collapse into a strategic routing, as an ultimately unstoppable measure to allow female consecration would soon emerge, shorn of all compromise. For the church as a whole, meanwhile, the caricature of a split, introspective and outdated institution would be burnt anew on the public mind."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
