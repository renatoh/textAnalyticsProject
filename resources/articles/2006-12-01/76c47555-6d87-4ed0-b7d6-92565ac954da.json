This thought echoes comments over several years by teachers, ministers, academics and business leaders. For me, creativity is the ultimate expression of individuality, and characteristically human: it is deeply fulfilling for those who achieve it, and usually of benefit to wider society. Yet creativity is as hard to study scientifically as it is to identify. Back in 1999, I contributed to the DfES's Creative and Cultural Education report, which suggested that \"creativity is imaginative activity fashioned so as to produce outcomes that are both original and of value\". The report went on to list the key factors in creative activities. \"First, they always involve thinking or behaving imaginatively. Second, overall this imaginative activity is purposeful: that is, directed to achieving an objective. Third, these processes must generate something original. Fourth, the outcome must be of value in relation to the objective.\" Yet while this definition might be helpful in providing a checklist to evaluate whether something or someone is creative, it does not get to grips with the actual brain processes that result in these desiderata. Interestingly, one group that tends to be more creative than the general population is dyslexics. A prevailing theory of dyslexia suggests that most reading difficulties arise from a problem in a group of brain cells responsible for timing visual events when reading. The genes that underlie this disadvantage would not be so common unless there were compensating advantages to dyslexia. The Oxford scientist John Stein suggests that in some dyslexics there may be heightened development of another system in the brain that underlies their holistic, artistic and entrepreneurial talents, \"seeing the whole picture\". Of course, dyslexia affects more than the balance between reading skills and creativity, and impacts upon other aspects of individuals' lives, such as their wider learning and their self-esteem. Ongoing scientific and educational research provides ways of helping overcome the reading difficulties caused by dyslexia. If we are to place more of a premium on creativity in the future, it may be that during such interventions we should be mindful to preserve and celebrate the inherent, untaught abilities of dyslexics. In 2007, the new undergraduate intake at Tufts University in Massachusetts will be the first cohort to go through an admissions procedure that attempts to measure creative and practical ability alongside analytical ability - which is measured through assessment such as the American standardised tests, A-levels and IQ tests. This change of emphasis came about through a research programme at Tufts which concluded that stand-alone tests of analytical abilities are not very good predictors of success later on in life, particularly in the workplace. As computing and IT becomes more pervasive in the classroom, it will no doubt affect the way our children, as well as their teachers and parents, develop, learn and behave. For example, social online networks may increase the interaction between individuals which, on the one hand, can enhance creativity or, as others have suggested, can reduce the individual to a node in the network, paralysed by the need to refer to the group before they think or act. Organisations such as Futurelab and Creative Partnerships are working to ensure that new technologies can help to nurture the creativity of our young people. If we are to help meet this global education challenge and prepare our young people for a creative future, we need to tap into the joint experience and expertise of teachers and brain scientists. If we can develop a more complete picture of the subtle factors that promote and inhibit creativity, it will help us to enhance each individual's development of a creative mind.
