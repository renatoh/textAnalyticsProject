The images, taken on Monday, show \u00d3scar Alberto Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez, 26, and his daughter Valeria, lying face down in shallow water. The 23-month-old toddler\u2019s arm is draped around her father\u2019s neck, suggesting that she was clinging to him in her final moments. The UN refugee agency compared the photograph to the 2015 image of the three-year-old Syrian boy Alan Kurdi who drowned off the Greek island of Kos \u2013 although it remains to be seen if it will have the same impact on America\u2019s fierce immigration debate. Their bodies were discovered on the bank of the river near Matamoros, Mexico, across from Brownsville, Texas, just half a mile (1km) from an international bridge. According to Julia Le Duc, a reporter for La Jornada, Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez had arrived in Matamoros on Sunday, hoping to request asylum from US authorities with his wife, Vanessa \u00c1valos, and their daughter. But when he realized that it could be weeks before they were even able to start the asylum process, Mart\u00ednez decided they should swim across, said Le Duc, who witnessed \u00c1valos give her account to the police. \u201cHe crossed first with the little girl and he left her on the American side. Then he turned back to get his wife, but the girl went into the water after him. When he went to save her, the current took them both,\u201d Le Duc told the Guardian. The image underlines the dangers which mostly Central American migrants face in their attempts to escape violence, corruption and poverty at home and find asylum in the United States. As part of a broader crack down on migration, the Trump administration tightened the country\u2019s asylum system, creating a growing backlog of cases. Migrants are routinely forced to wait for months to start the asylum process; those who despair of waiting turn to more remote and dangerous routes across the southern frontier. On Sunday, two babies, a toddler and a woman were found dead after succumbing to heat exhaustion in Anzalduas Park, which borders the river in the city of Mission. Elsewhere three children and a woman from Honduras died in April after their raft capsized on the Rio Grande, and a six-year-old from India was found dead earlier this month in Arizona, where temperatures routinely soar well above 100F. So far this year, dozens of people have died attempting to cross the Rio Grande, where water levels are at their highest levels in 20 years and record levels of snowmelt run-off have transformed the river into a raging torrent. Claudia Hern\u00e1ndez, a Mexican police officer in the border town of Piedras Negras, told the Guardian: \u201cThe river is treacherous and people who aren\u2019t from here don\u2019t know that. I grew up here along the R\u00edo Bravo River [R\u00edo Grande]. I wouldn\u2019t even go into that water to bathe or swim. There are springs and whirlpools and when the current takes you it can pull you under.\u201d Isabel Turcios, a Franciscan nun, the director of the Casa del Migrante shelter in Piedras Negras said that local activists warn migrants not to try their luck on the river, but the US has drastically reduced the number of migrants who are allowed to request asylum each day. \u201cPeople get desperate and cannot keep waiting. They just want to cross. So they go to the river and without any form of protection \u2013 no lifejacket, nothing to save them \u2013 they go into the river. They always tell me that if God wants them to make it then somehow they will make it.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s not how things should be. They should be able to cross at the bridges. Every human being has the right to migrate. It\u2019s a human right.\u201d Meanwhile Mexico has launched its own crackdown on migrants as the government scrambles to ward off Trump\u2019s threat of trade tariffs. \u201cVery regrettable that this would happen,\u201d said President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador on Tuesday in response to a question about the latest deaths on the border. \u201cAs there is more rejection in the United States, there are people who lose their lives in the desert or crossing\u201d the river. According to reports in the local press, Mart\u00ednez, \u00c1valos and their daughter left their home in the municipality of San Mart\u00edn in April. But after two months waiting in the southern city of Tapachula \u2013 and fearful of the Mexican authorities \u2013 the family decided to push on. \u201cThey said they were scared because of the way things were going for migrants, what with the pressure from Trump. That\u2019s why they decided to cross the river. Their plan was to hand themselves into US migration,\u201d Mart\u00ednez\u2019s sister Wendy told El Diario de Hoy. One of Mart\u00ednez\u2019s cousins, Enrique G\u00f3mez, tweeted an appeal to the Salvadoran president, Nayib Bukele, pleading for help in repatriating the bodies. G\u00f3mez said the family sought assistance from the Salvadoran government but were being charged between $7,000 and $8,000 to repatriate the bodies. Bukele\u2019s office responded by asking G\u00f3mez to send a private message and promised to start the repatriations. On Wednesday, Pope Francis expressed \u201cimmense sadness\u201d over the fate of Mart\u00ednez and his daughter. \u201cThe pope is profoundly saddened by their death, and is praying for them and for all migrants who have lost their lives while seeking to flee war and misery,\u201d a spokesman said in a statement. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said the deaths represent \u201ca failure to address the violence and desperation pushing people to take journeys of danger for the prospect of a life in safety and dignity.\u201d In the US, several Democratic presidential candidates, including Kamala Harris, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Cory Booker, also expressed their dismay on Tuesday evening. \u201cTrump is responsible for these deaths,\u201d wrote O\u2019Rourke in a tweet, while Harris called it \u201ca stain on our moral conscience\u201d. The photograph of Mart\u00ednez and his daughter provoked soul-searching among some Mexicans, but recent polls revealed that attitudes towards migrants have hardened in recent months. \u201cThe image \u2026 is a painful symptom of our systematic failure,\u201d tweeted author Alma Delia Murillo. \u201cAnd on top of that you have idiots who blame the migrants.\u201d Polling firm Parametr\u00eda showed 58% of Mexicans oppose migrants entering the country from Central America. 32% of respondents expressed the same opinion on November, when migrant caravans were welcomed with outpourings of generosity.
