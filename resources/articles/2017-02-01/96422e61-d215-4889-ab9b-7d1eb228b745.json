The reigning European indoor 60m champion had to borrow a friend\u2019s shoes, which he believes contributed to a false start in the final in Sheffield \u2013 and left him relying on the discretion of the UK Athletics selectors on Monday for a place in next month\u2019s championships Belgrade. \u201cMy spikes were actually stolen from the call room,\u201d Kilty said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make any excuses for my false start at the time but literally everything was going smoothly, I headed to the call room and my spikes weren\u2019t there. The physios tipped up every bed and bag but they weren\u2019t there so my mind was going a million miles an hour. \u201cI thought I wasn\u2019t going to be able to run. I actually had a pair that belonged to Luke Lennon Ford in the back of my car, they were a size 10, which is a size and a half too big, but I strapped them on. I was on the marks just confused and my emotions were everywhere.\u201d When asked whether he thought it was sabotage, Kilty replied: \u201cPotentially, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s one of those things but next time I\u2019ll know to bring two pairs of spikes, lock them up and that\u2019s it.\u201d That false start meant Kilty missed out on the two automatic places in the 60m for Belgrade. However, he looks certain to get the nod for the final discretionary spot when selectors meet on Monday after finishing ahead of his two main rivals, CJ Ujah and James Dasaolu, at the grand prix in Birmingham on Saturday \u2013 despite running with flu. \u201cI woke up Wednesday with cold sweats, you can probably hear it in my voice, I\u2019m full of flu,\u201d said Kilty, who finished third in 6.58sec, behind the American Ronnie Baker and Kim Collins from St Kitts and Nevis. \u201cI was considering not coming and when I was warming up I could barely breathe. But I was basically told that I needed to come out here and perform. My aim was to make sure I just had to beat every other British person. I\u2019ve done that and hopefully that will be enough. \u201cI think I\u2019ll gain a tenth of a second once my illness clears up and I\u2019m in Belgrade and rested. Now my mind is at peace.\u201d Kilty, who also won world indoor gold in 2014, believes he is in shape to become the first British sprinter since Jason Gardener to retain a European indoor title \u2013 which he intends to dedicate to his baby son, who is also called Richard. \u201cAll winter through training I\u2019ve just been thinking about how much I want to bring that medal home to my little boy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was feeling sick and tired that was what was getting me up.\u201d Kilty also revealed that his partner, the Lithuanian triple jumper Dovile Dzindzaletaite, who came second in the world junior championships in 2012, wants to compete for Britain in the future. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something we have talked about a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s far better than what we have got at the moment. No disrespect to the others but she is one of the best triple jumpers in the world at her best and I know there is a ban on switching nationality but when that changes I think British Athletics would be pleased to have her.\u201d Meanwhile Mo Farah has flown back to Ethiopia for another four-week block of altitude training after breaking his own British indoor 5,000m record on Saturday. Farah, whose next race is likely to be the Two Oceans half-marathon in South African over Easter weekend, said that the last indoor race of his career had been emotional. \u201cThe crowd were amazing so I can only imagine what it will be like at Stratford when I finish my career on the track in August,\u201d he added, referring to the outdoor world championships."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
