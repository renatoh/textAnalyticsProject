He has also just written a book in which he confronts his brutal past with an unflinching gaze. Over the years Barton has been imprisoned, banned, deported and mocked for his attempts to educate and improve himself. The latest vortex unfurls in Glasgow where Barton, surprisingly, is calm and amiable. But he retains his old verbal swagger. \u201cThe tallest trees catch the most wind,\u201d he says with a little smile. \u201cThat comes with the territory of being me.\u201d Ten days ago cackling Celtic fans had called the police to report a missing person. His name was Joseph Barton and the new Rangers signing had last been seen \u201cin the pocket of Scott Brown\u201d \u2013 the Celtic captain, who led the champions to a 5-1 thrashing of their bitter rivals in the first Old Firm league match in four years. His future at Rangers has since been pushed to the brink. Last Tuesday Barton was involved in another \u201ctraining ground bust-up\u201d, a familiar routine in a turbulent career, after he and his team-mate Andy Halliday became embroiled in a heated disagreement over Rangers\u2019 performance. Only Barton was disciplined by Rangers\u2019 manager, Mark Warburton, who ordered him to stay away from the club for six days \u2013 so he could \u201cre-evaluate\u201d his behaviour before returning on Monday. Barton issued a statement on Twitter, stressing that he would like to \u201capologise unreservedly\u201d after \u201csome of the things I said were inappropriate\u201d. But he soon tweeted again: \u201cApologising doesn\u2019t always mean that you\u2019re wrong and the other person is right.\u201d He phoned TalkSport the following morning and said he did not feel he needed to apologise for anything \u2013 affirming his commitment to Rangers and conceding that \u201cmaybe I could communicate better\u201d. The midfielder met Warburton and the Rangers hierarchy on Monday morning and accepted a three-week suspension from the club. Warbuton said that all parties \u201cneed time and space\u201d and that neither Rangers nor Barton would comment further. Amid such tumult Barton\u2019s compelling autobiography is even more striking. In person he sounds polite when mentioning his \u201cindiscretions\u201d and \u201cmisdemeanours\u201d \u2013 but the book, co-written with the authoritative Michael Calvin, probes the dark undertow of Barton\u2019s past. It becomes easier to understand an intelligent footballer whose intense character has fluctuated so often between volatility and vulnerability and led him across terrain far more distressing than his current problems in Glasgow. As Barton says soon after we sat down together last week: \u201cSomeone with my character is a borderline kamikaze pilot.\u201d Ten years ago even the Celtic fans\u2019 comic calls to the police would have wounded him terribly. \u201cOf course,\u201d Barton says, \u201cif you\u2019re emotionally vulnerable it would do. There are still days when stuff penetrates. I\u2019m not a robot. But the way I communicate means I polarise people. I also accept there will be people who want to see me fall flat on my face. I don\u2019t fear failure. I just say: \u2018Make bold statements and work towards them. Say you are going to be the best player in the league and work towards it. Don\u2019t come in and play it down. Be bold.\u2019\u201d Barton explains how he was encouraged by his mentor, Peter Kay, to believe in his intelligence, and develop it, as a way of shaking off his low self\u2011esteem. Kay, who co-founded with Tony Adams the charity Sporting Chance to help troubled sportsmen, had a profound impact on Barton. \u201cPeter saw the good in me long before I did because, until I met him, I just thought: \u2018Fuck the world.\u2019 I had \u2018Fuck off\u2019 stamped on my forehead and thought: \u2018Nah, I\u2019m not going to take a backward step.\u2019 \u201cAfter we got pasted 5-1 the old me would have lamped someone. But I went round and shook everyone\u2019s hand. It was important to look [Celtic] in the eye and say: \u2018Well played.\u2019 We got pumped 5-1 in the biggest game in this country but there are going to be days when you have to say: \u2018You know what? He was better than me today.\u2019\u201d Barton insists that his crisis at Rangers can be resolved. \u201cI\u2019ve been in tighter situations than this and turned it around. If it works out \u2026 fantastic. If it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019re all grown men. But we can sort it out. We can dust ourselves down and go again.\u201d Barton is a pantomime villain again in Glasgow. He is a driven character and his passion can resemble a kind of fury that, he says, stems from the fact \u201cI care about the clubs I play for\u201d. He says: \u201cI care about what I do. I\u2019ve always cared about what I\u2019ve contributed even if I\u2019ve not been fully understood at the time. I care deeply. It\u2019s probably my biggest curse. I care too much. Some of my issues at Rangers are because I care. I am trying to offer solutions to make things better and people are hit with the truth.\u201d Diplomacy and self-effacement have not featured much since he turned up in Glasgow two months ago. \u201cI\u2019ve come up making a bold statement about the champions of Scotland \u2013 saying we can overthrow them. I\u2019ve said that the retired captain of Scotland [Brown] is not actually that good. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in the same league as me. People have gone bang [Barton smacks his fist into his palm]. They are waiting for me to fall. I had to hit the ground playing like Lionel Messi to stand any chance.\u201d Barton smiles ruefully. \u201cI\u2019ve never played like Messi in my career. So we\u2019ve got the introspection of the media up here \u2013 and on the other side you\u2019ve got someone as strong-headed as me, someone who knows their profession deeply. Football is my art form and I\u2019ve gone: \u2018OK. This is not the worst painting I\u2019ve ever done. It\u2019s not vintage but it\u2019s not the worst.\u2019 I\u2019ve got people who I don\u2019t think have seen any decent art in I don\u2019t know however many years critiquing me. Now everything in me wants to go: \u2018What the fuck do you know?\u2019 \u201cBut, after Celtic, I\u2019m having to sit here and take it on the chin \u2013 however unjust I feel that is. It\u2019s difficult when I\u2019m playing at a level which, clearly, I\u2019ve not played at before. It\u2019s a much lower level and I\u2019m trying to help people get to a higher level. They think me helping is me trying to say: \u2018You\u2019re not good enough.\u2019 It\u2019s difficult.\u201d Away from the hothouse, amid banishment from Rangers, there is renewed introspection in Barton. \u201cI find myself walking around and looking down, trying to avoid eye contact with people. I keep a journal and I\u2019ve been reflecting on that. The difficulty is that if someone is looking for conflict I won\u2019t shy away from it \u2013 ever. So I\u2019m avoiding giving anyone the opportunity.\u201d Barton was Burnley\u2019s player of the year last season, when he helped them to win the Championship and promotion to the Premier League under a manager, Sean Dyche, whom he likes and respects. He was offered a two-year contract at Turf Moor that was far more lucrative than the offer from Rangers \u2013 but Barton thinks differently to the archetypal modern footballer. \u201cI felt it had run its course,\u201d he says of his time at Burnley. \u201cI needed another challenge, another experience, even though there have been days since then when I\u2019ve thought: \u2018Why? Why did I do that?\u2019 But I\u2019ve got to believe in Rangers even if it\u2019s been much harder than I expected.\u201d Barton takes a bite out of a mid\u2011afternoon sandwich in the well\u2011heeled neighbourhood of Bearsden, six miles from the centre of Glasgow, and thinks about his move. \u201cKnowing what I know now?\u201d he says, chewing thoughtfully. \u201cReflecting on it, would I have made the same decision? Probably not. I\u2019ve even been honest with people about that. There is an honesty that I am operating which means some people think I\u2019m critiquing them. But I know that in time it will turn out to be the right decision. As tough as it is, adversity brings out the best in you. \u201cThis is a country of five million people and pretty much all anyone cares about is Rangers and Celtic. Of course there is a small periphery who don\u2019t. In England that\u2019s diluted by 20 clubs. I\u2019ve come up and I\u2019m the Englishman \u2013 and there is the England-Scotland rivalry.\u201d Barton laughs, with a touch of self\u2011mockery. \u201cIf everyone just listened to me it would be fine. Look, everyone is really emotional about Rangers and Celtic up here. But when you\u2019re tasked with being a leader, if you make emotional decisions you tend to make the wrong decisions. This is the way it is and, listen, if you don\u2019t like it there is always the option to say: \u2018Hey, I\u2019ve had enough. It\u2019s not as if someone is holding a sword to my throat and I\u2019ve got no way out. Fucking hell, this is tiddlywinks compared to what I\u2019ve been though in life.\u201d The list of problems in Barton\u2019s career is long. He covers each in his book from stubbing out a cigar in Jamie Tandy\u2019s eye after the youth player attempted to set fire to Barton\u2019s shirt at Manchester City\u2019s Christmas party in 2004 to being jailed for six months in 2008 after he assaulted a teenager in a drunken brawl in Liverpool. Barton was also fined \u00a3100,000 for punching his City team-mate Ousmane Dabo in 2007 and two years earlier was sent home from a tour in Thailand after he assaulted a young Everton fan who had kicked him. That incident was followed, the next day, by his horrified discovery that his brother, Michael, was on the run after the murder of an innocent young black man called Anthony Walker. Michael Barton was eventually sentenced to 17 years in prison. Their cousin, Paul, received a 23-year sentence for a racially motivated killing. In his book, Barton\u2019s shame is profound. \u201cThere were times when I was crying because there is stuff that someone like me tries to compartmentalise,\u201d Barton says. \u201cEven getting through the process of my brother\u2019s murder trial, I had to face emotions I had boxed away, even stuff to do with my own indiscretions. These are like childhood memories which, good or bad, made you who you are. The experiences of the place where you grew up, good or bad, have made you the person you are today. \u201cThe way I am now is because of everything that has gone before. I know I\u2019ve fucked up, I know I\u2019ve been public enemy No1. I can\u2019t change that but I have long wanted to make a positive contribution.\u201d His own time in jail initially terrified him but, then, Barton realised he was imprisoned even more by the constraints of his muddled mind. \u201cI never thought I would end up in prison, even at the peak of my misdemeanours. I thought: \u2018I\u2019m not a criminal. All I\u2019ve been doing is going out drinking, having a scrap. It\u2019s what lads do.\u2019 There was shock at first: \u2018Oh shit, you are going in there.\u2019 But I am also capable of being very analytical and I prepared myself for prison. I used my time positively.\u201d Barton, the second footballer to have appeared on Question Time, has thought deeply about the flaws in the prison system but he acknowledges he also began to change for the better once he had been made to confront the severity of his mistakes. He also learned not to blame his tough past in Liverpool \u2013 on the St John\u2019s council estate in Huyton. Bleak incidents of violence and drug\u2011taking surrounded him as a boy. When he was bitten by an alsatian his dad, Joseph, hunted down the dog. In front of the animal\u2019s owner, he drove over the dog, twice, to ensure its death. It was \u201cthe St John\u2019s way\u201d. One of the few lessons his father handed down to him centred on the technique, in a street fight, of holding a man\u2019s neck while punching him to ensure victory. \u201cWithout wanting to critique his parental skills, he was preparing me for the world he thought I\u2019d face,\u201d Barton says of his father. \u201cIt was his world. It\u2019s a world where you need a skillset that isn\u2019t the same if you\u2019re going to Eton and becoming an MP. At 24 I felt he\u2019d let me down. But now, through more mature eyes, I can see he did the best he could. \u201cAnd if I had been given a more well\u2011rounded approach I wouldn\u2019t have ended up in the Premier League. If you look at the socio-economic backgrounds of most footballers they come from certain parts of town. But I\u2019m not going to bastardise the place I come from. It\u2019s made me who I am. Good and bad. It\u2019s given me some character flaws but it\u2019s also made a great part of my character.\u201d Barton argues: \u201cYou can\u2019t be honest in football. Honesty is seen as weakness because of the fickle, showbiz nature of the industry. Whether it\u2019s to do with mental illness or just being human the thinking is: \u2018You\u2019re a footballer \u2013 how can you be sad or vulnerable? You\u2019re on X thousand pounds a week. How dare you feel like a human being?\u2019\u201d Barton is even more scathing towards those who run the modern game. \u201cFootball is immoral. It\u2019s an immoral industry. The way it treats young people is immoral. The way it deals with players as commodities is immoral. The way it dismisses people who have been in a job so long is immoral. The argument goes: \u2018Oh, they\u2019ve been compensated. That\u2019s the nature of the industry.\u2019 But it\u2019s horrible and immoral. \u201cWe\u2019re on a collision course for something disastrous. Football is now a bull market. The last TV deal, the next TV deal \u2026 at some point that\u2019s going to go and what\u2019s left? We\u2019ve seen it with football clubs in Scotland. There has been an Armageddon. Rangers had decades of overspending. What\u2019s left afterwards? Who picks up the pieces? The fans, people in the community. Football clubs represent the community and just look at how much money is going away from the grassroots. It\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s immoral.\u201d Barton skewers Mike Ashley, Newcastle United\u2019s owner, with a simple story. When Barton was released from prison on bail he was placed in the care of Peter Kay in Southampton \u2013 and only allowed out between 7am and 7pm. Kay had convinced the judge that, while he would counsel Barton, the footballer would be more balanced if he played the game he loved. \u201cAshley offered me his helicopter,\u201d Barton remembers, \u201cas my curfew meant Pete and I needed to fly to and from training in Newcastle. It seemed really generous until I got an eye\u2011boggling invoice. It was business after all.\u201d Barton might be repeating his old mistakes at Rangers. But, as his book reveals, few people know that Celtic tried to entice him away once they knew Rangers were close to signing him. \u201cI was never going to change my mind and let down Rangers,\u201d Barton says now. \u201cSo I wonder how that will play out when people hear about it.\u201d The situation at Ibrox appears dire and Barton\u2019s future in Glasgow will be tested again during his suspension. But last week he sounded optimistic despite the storm. He sounded hopeful of a resolution. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it happen in scenarios way worse than this. I know that I can turn it round. I\u2019m looking at it and thinking: \u2018OK, I\u2019ve got to take this kick in the balls because they want to put this flash English bastard in his place.\u2019 I\u2019ve got to take the kinks and the bumps. It\u2019s the grind that makes it worthwhile. It might not actually be successful but it\u2019s the process. Not everybody is always aligned with that. People\u2019s positions can be compromised. But you have to try make it work. \u201cUp here there have been loads of words. It\u2019s going to take time before my actions give me credibility. But I always thought coming to Rangers would be an amazing learning experience. Very few clubs in the world have this introspection or political and cultural history. I loved Burnley but I wanted to challenge myself. I am now massively out of my comfort zone. I\u2019ve got work to do and there are certain parts of my character I need to improve but I\u2019m also learning every day. It\u2019s not always great learning \u2013 because people are fighting against you. They don\u2019t want to see you do well. But all the time I am refreshing and upgrading myself for whatever comes next. \u201cI left Burnley on a high and here I am now, in a low. But if you set a course through life where you don\u2019t have any tough times how can you develop? If it\u2019s easy, what the fuck do you learn? The tough times shape you. They make you better. And I believe I\u2019m going to come out of this latest tough spell a better person.\u201d No Nonsense by Joey Barton is published by Simon &amp; Schuster"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
