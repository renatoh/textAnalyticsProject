This is actually short of the truth, which is more extraordinary. Before Pushkin, there was no Russian literature to speak of. Pushkin started it all - he created the language of literature, the forms and language of poetry; he laid at the emperor's and the people's feet the gift of a literary culture. He died, forced to breathe the foul air of that emperor's court, in a futile duel at the age of 37. By the time he was 50 years dead, Russia had witnessed Lermontov, Turgenev, Gogol, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy and Chekhov. And the more remarkable part is that the achievement wasn't spontaneous. As a boy, neglected and book-consuming, Alexander Sergeyevich read to conquer, everything from Cervantes, Rabelais and Sterne to his father's collection of pornography. His nurse, Arina Rodionovna, filled his head with folk tales. He read Byron; he knew his English novelists and his French. What he did with it all was to say, I don't care if these people are English or French or Spanish or Russian, they're all mine. And out of his sense of freedom came a uniquely Russian creation. As the dissident novelist Andrei Bitov, author of the novel Pushkin House, put it: \"Pushkin reflects our mentality, our ecology of culture. In one person we overjumped 300 years.\" Of some interest to us in the west perhaps is that, without western literature - no Pushkin. At the heart of Pushkin's genius is Yevgeny Onegin, that great romance-novel in verse. Onegin is curiously simple, in essence a non-story. Tatyana loves Onegin, he doesn't love her; then Onegin loves Tatyana, she won't leave her husband for him. But its importance comes from other elements, primarily its self-consciousness and its language. Try Charles Johnston's fine rhyming Penguin translation: ...this pied collection begs your indulgence - it's been spun from threads both sad and humoristic, themes popular or idealistic, products of carefree hours, of fun, of sleeplessness, faint inspirations, of powers unripe, or on the wane, of reason's icy intimations, and records of a heart in pain. That playfulness of language and of feeling - of a free mind at play - is what makes Onegin the Russian novel from which all others are descended. (How handsomely he repays us for the privilege of talking about suffering!) As the novelist Vladimir Kornilov observed to me in Moscow: \"Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Gogol, they all found in Pushkin something in common with them. Pushkin was the ultimate source of their literary patterns.\" Of Onegin, Kornilov's contemporary Yuri Mamleyev said: \"It is a great historical panorama of ordinary Russian life, very clear, very powerful. If you read Yevgeny Onegin, in your imagination that time is clear like the present.\" In the wake of perestroika, dissidents like Bitov, Kornilov and Mamleyev saw their enterprise falter, though Mamleyev has recently published a well-received novel, The Roaming Time. Their successors, writers like Victor Pelevin and Tatyana Tolstaya, have fictionalised the social and economic upheaval as an assault on our confidence in reality. To relish the chaos and absurdity of Russia is now the sum of literary freedom - though at least that suggests that Russia's novelists are still characterised by a stance of resistance originating with Pushkin 200 years ago. Under constant surveillance after 1825, unable to publish freely, censored by the atrocious secret-police chief Count Benckendorff and Nicholas I himself (who personally excised the word \"chamberpot\" from one of his poems), he succeeded all the same, as Tatyana Tolstaya said, in radiating an exemplary dignity. \"He felt an inner freedom, which is especially wonderful, because he was a slave of that regime, he could never move freely around, he was never allowed abroad... that's a great man.\" In today's Russia, plentiful evidence exists of the contemporary version of autocracy. In St Petersburg, I went one day with the crime writer Julia Latynina to revisit the scene of a recent gangland murder, an episode in a business feud that has had repercussions all the way up to the city's governor, Yakovlev. At one of the outer city's boundless tower-block estates, she offered an analysis of modern Russian life. \"We're living in Russia in a sort of new industrial feudalism, with industrial plants that are like castles. In a castle there's only one owner, and it's the same with the oligarchs. If you have 51% of the plant you have everything. If you have 49%, that's zero. There are no laws. If you observe the law you are ruined. Instead of laws, there are personal relationships.\" It is these places, the booby-trapped estates and fortified factory plants, that are the new background of the Russian novel, be it satirical, absurdist, violent, or probing the Russian soul for some new expression of what it means, post Pushkin, post two systemic collapses in a single century, to be a free Russian. When Isaac Babel, the author of the Red Cavalry stories, toured the Ukrainian countryside in 1930 and saw the brutality of Stalin's forced collectivisation, he was already halfway to losing his enthusiasm for socialism. (Criticised afterwards for the crime of \"silence\", with the logic of which tyranny is capable he was silenced for ever in the Lubyanka prison 10 years later.) What he saw was Ukraine being used as a guinea pig: its agricultural assets stripped, the country was cultivated as a quaint Soviet backwater, a territory of martyrdom and sentimental folklore. (It was not just Russian writers who ended up \"strangled in a doorway\", in the phrase of Vassily Grossman; 600 Ukrainian writers died in the gulag.) There is a special poignancy about Ukraine's fate, because its place outside Europe is a geopolitical accident. Kiev, Lviv, Odessa - its great cities - are historical centres of European learning and mercantile and political power. Babel writes of merchants who would read the Manchester Guardian at their Black Sea dachas. Nine hundred years earlier, Anna Jaroslavna, daughter of Jaroslav the Wise, who knew languages, geometry and astronomy and married Henry I of France in 1051, wrote disdainfully to her father in Kiev: \"Paris seems like a distant village.\" Today Ukraine offers a rare phenomenon, that of a literature starting again almost from scratch. What connects that literature to the west is a curious paradox of communism: during their shut-up years, Europe was to the Soviet peoples an almost entirely literary concept, seen (highly selectively) through the books of its novelists. European in tone and Russian in its directness, Ukrainian literature inevitably acquired a national, even nationalist, aspect after the country's hesitant independence in 1991. \"Apart from the political censorship, we had what can be called linguistic censorship: there were long lists of words which were banned or not recommended to be used, since the policy was to get Ukrainian closer and closer to Russian, with the prospect of final extinction of Ukrainian.\" Oksana Zabuzhko, author of a shameless chronicle of life in the transition years, Fieldwork in Ukrainian Sex, has no time for the \"bold Cossack boys\" rhetoric of the Lviv nationalists, but insists on that national consciousness. \"We're the country that appeared from nowhere, and of course we're the literature which appeared from nowhere, and we still have to explain that not only does it exist, but it boasts actually a couple of great writers and a number of writers worth reading.\" One might guess that those great writers include Mikhail Bulgakov and Isaac Babel, born in Kiev and Odessa respectively. One would be wrong; both wrote in Russian and are thought of as Russians. The writers who might be considered great Ukrainians - Ivan Franko, Volodymyr Vynnychenko, or Khvyl'ovy - are practically unknown in the west. As, still, are their modern counterparts - writers of the calibre of Zabuzhko, Yuri Andrukhovych, Evhenia Kononenko, the once-banned existentialist Yuri Shevchuk and Lviv's favourite literary son, Yuri Vynnychuk. The situation is improving, but it is not easy to be a novelist in Ukraine. It would be interesting, for instance, to see British writers paid by their publishers as Ukrainians are, in free copies of their own books that they can sell at readings. And a mild tension persists between those who write in Ukrainian, and writers like Andrei Kurkov who write in Russian - a state of affairs understandably intensified by the fact that Kurkov's enjoyable satire on Ukrainian conditions, Death and the Penguin, is the only recent novel with a Ukrainian subject to be widely translated. That there are future discoveries to be made on the other side of the Carpathians is well demonstrated by the first English-language anthology of Ukrainian fiction, recently published by Glas, entitled From Three Worlds. Yet a decade is poor recovery time for the kind of identity-theft that Ukraine endured within the USSR (not to mention the previous 250 years of Romanovs). Yuri Andrukhovych, the winner of last year's Herder Prize and author of an excellently observed serio-comic novel called Recreations (which is available in English), spelled out what he sees as his and his contemporaries' purpose. \"As a nation we are still on the road, and we still can't find ourselves. Our generation has to work to change this reduced image of Ukrainianness in the consciousness of Ukrainians themselves. [As a writer,] this is my task. I have to create this new understanding of Ukraine - to mythologise this country again.\" Quixote is dead! you might murmur.
