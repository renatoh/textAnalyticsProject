But the royal blue team came away from this year\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup with two wins to O\u2019Brien\u2019s one, and both were recorded on the main Saturday card, including Talismanic\u2019s success in the Turf, second only to the Classic in terms of its prize fund and prestige. Like the supporters of a football team who have finally notched a derby win against their fiercest rival, they will have felt relief as well as jubilation on Sunday morning. Neither of their winners started favourite, or even at single-figure odds, whereas O\u2019Brien had fancied runners throughout the two days, including Highland Reel, third behind Talismanic in the Turf. But when it mattered, both Wuheida and Talismanic delivered. O\u2019Brien, of course, has 27 Group One winners this year to confirm Ballydoyle\u2019s status as the most powerful and successful stable in the game. He also left California with another Breeders\u2019 Cup winner, his 12th in all, and the dirt-bred Mendelssohn, who took Friday\u2019s Juvenile Turf, offers hope of a serious challenge for the Kentucky Derby next May. Two winners at the Breeders\u2019 Cup does not even begin to close the gap between the Godolphin and Coolmore/Ballydoyle bloodstock operations, which has been extending for at least a dozen years. But it is \u2013 or could be \u2013 a start, and Joe Osborne, who took over from John Ferguson as Godolphin\u2019s chief executive after infighting in the organisation went public earlier this year, will have slept well on the flight to Melbourne, where Godolphin run Hartnell in Tuesday\u2019s Melbourne Cup. Hartnell is an outsider in the Flemington race, in which Hughie Morrison\u2019s Marmelo and last year\u2019s winner Almandin, with Frankie Dettori booked to ride, are vying for favouritism. Dettori\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup was a series of disappointments, not least when Ulysses, the favourite for the Turf, was scratched less than 24 hours before the race, but Almandin has a clear chance to give him a first success in Australia\u2019s most famous race, having suffered plenty of criticism locally for some of his rides there in the past. But if Hartnell is unlikely to add to Godolphin\u2019s tally, their global operation, which includes horses in training in more than 20 stables, has still won 18 Group One events in 2017, no match for O\u2019Brien\u2019s 27 from a single yard but an impressive return all the same. William Buick, who rode as calm and uncomplicated a race as you could ever hope to see aboard Wuheida, the Filly &amp; Mare Turf winner, has the Breeders\u2019 Cup monkey off his back. Godolphin can also stride into 2018 and beyond having recently cast off the straitjacket of Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s decade-long boycott of Coolmore-sired yearlings at the sales. There have, of course, been quite a few false dawns for Godolphin in recent years. There was, for instance, the charismatic young trainer who moved into their Moulton Paddocks complex in Newmarket, saddled a Classic winner and then gave his name to the Mahmood al-Zarooni doping scandal. What might be different this time, though, is that over the course of the next two or three years, Godolphin should once again be able to deploy Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s buying power to full effect in the sales ring. The degree to which the boycott of Coolmore-sired yearlings was a personal dispute with John Magnier, Coolmore\u2019s driving force, was probably exaggerated. Both men are ultimately in the stallion business, and it makes commercial sense to spend their money boosting their own rosters. But the form book makes it clear that Coolmore have had the best of the bloodlines for a decade at least, and arguably since Sadler\u2019s Wells established himself as Europe\u2019s top sire almost 30 years ago. As a result, the old policy of spending Dubai\u2019s money on Dubai\u2019s stallions was self-defeating. That wrong turn has now been acknowledged and Godolphin have started to retrace their steps. Godolphin, once again, could be on the way back \u2013 and this time they have got Galileo\u2019s.
