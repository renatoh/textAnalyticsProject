The palace staff keen to get cracking on Febrezing the shit out of all the furniture any of them touched. Harry unclenching his fists for the first time in 48 hours. Unfortunately for the Irish, Donald and Melania Trump arrived at Shannon airport to inflict themselves on another nation\u2019s hospitality \u2013 like a less charming double-act version of Edward Gorey\u2019s Doubtful Guest. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, last seen mixing with the Trump administration on American soil when he pointedly introduced his fit doctor boyfriend to anti-LGBT deputy president, Mike Pence, played another blinder. He refused to meet the Trumps at their Doonbeg golf course and instead \u201chosted\u201d them in an airport lounge. Which is about as welcoming as spitting in someone\u2019s tea in addition to making it the colour of a greyhound. Let\u2019s take a look. There are two letters missing from this picture and two letters only. Melania is dressed as one of those flying saucer sweets that literally nobody likes. Who is hearing \u201csherbet-filled rice paper\u201d and thinking \u201cyum!\u201d? Nobody, that\u2019s who. Well, Melania. I am real Melania. I am being held against will. When he eats hamburger in bed, he wipe grease on the duvet cover. He tweets in shower, and then doesn\u2019t understand why phone break. Please help me. I want live in basement with Tiffany. But he not let me. Do you have basement here in Ireland? Meet me at midnight. In all seriousness, this looks like the opening scene of a film that establishes the loner credentials of the protagonist who will go on to kill and kill again. The guy behind him will accidentally bump into Don Jr, and he\u2019ll freak out, and that\u2019s how we know he\u2019s unhinged. But also because he\u2019s wearing a padded jacket indoors. In June. Here is Varadkar looking at Trump while he compares the US-Mexico border to the Northern Ireland-Ireland border. This is the look I gave to a friend when, at the age of 29, she asked me whether football teams get a point in the table for every goal they score. This is the look I give to people when they go to a fancy restaurant and order a salad. The look I give to people standing on the packed lower deck blocking the stairs, when the entire upper deck is free. This is the look Jake Gyllenhaal gave to his co-star in a press junket when he butchered the pronunciation of \u201cmelancholy\u201d for the fifth time (definitely worth your time). Not to be outdone by brother Don Jr, Eric \u2013 who I am still not entirely convinced isn\u2019t in one of the Twilight films \u2013 models the look of minor celeb en route to a police station for questioning, while their PR scrambles to make it clear they are \u201cvoluntarily attending to assist with inquiries\u201d. Westlife when they got off the stools. Midnight. If you are confused, allow me to explain: this is a photograph of a man jumping on to a giant inflatable mattress with a terrifying picture of Trump\u2019s smug face on it. The installation is on display in Belfast. This is the stuff of nightmares, or would be, if every single waking day wasn\u2019t the equivalent of A Nightmare on Elm Street, but if you replaced \u201cstreet\u201d with most of the world\u2019s surface area.
