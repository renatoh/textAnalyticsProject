A celebrity in skin-tight silver Spandex stands by the edge of a pool. To the sound of a siren, a Styrofoam wall is revealed, with a shape cut out of it. The celebrity has a second to think about how to assume the shape of the hole before the wall comes towards them. If they pass through the wall successfully they get 10 points; if they end up in the pool, they score nothing. And that's it. It's a bit like those learning games babies have with shapes and holes, except these are grown-ups and they're using their bodies as the shapes. Human Tetris is another way of looking at it. It started in Japan (where else?) and has now been adopted by most of the world. If you look on YouTube, you'll see that the original is still the best. They take it more seriously there; Japan leads the world in ritual humiliation. Actually it's interesting how different countries have adopted it, a good lesson in international cultural diversity. In Italy, for example, the contestants are beautiful babes in bikinis and the shapes are virtually impossible to assume - the result being that the beautiful babes inevitably end up wet. Here we're a bit more PC and properly Spandexed up to the neck. Our celebrities are of the Strictly Come Dancing/ex-cricketer level. Nice Dale Winton hosts. It's cosy, and British, and amateur. When Nell McAndrew is dunked in the drink she gets three points anyway, for trying hard. Well done, Nell. So not so good as either Japan or Italy, then. But even bumbling Britishness can't ruin the idea; it is so beautifully simple, so very very stupid, and so hilarious. I can see it becoming essential Saturday family viewing. Students will love it, too - this is perfect stoner television. I know I'm hooked. You could describe Fringe (Sky1, Sunday) as X-Files updated for the age of terrorism, with the ambition of a Lost or a Heroes. Fringe means the fringe of science - teleportation, artificial intelligence, precognition, dark matter, all that. But there's enough going on, and proper characters with real emotions, for non-sci-fi fanatics to get involved, too. A plane lands in Boston with everyone on board melted from the inside out, and splattered all over the windows. It must have been a terrible shock for the man on the ground waving the lollipops. Then nice FBI man John Knox is exposed to the deadly flesh-eating toxin, too, and semi-dissolves. His girlfriend, Anna, another FBI agent, drops LSD, strips down to her undies and gets in a tank of water (the Italians are going to like this) so she can telepathically communicate with John and save him. Which she does, but then he turns out to be a baddie after all, and is killed, properly this time, but not so properly that he can't then be taken in for questioning by creepy conglomerate Massive Dynamic. There's something called The Pattern, too, but that's so secret I can't tell you what it is, otherwise all my own cells would crystallise. And The Observer, who has no eyebrows. Never trust a man with no eyebrows, my mum always told me, even if he's named after a reputable Sunday newspaper. I think what's going on is that science has got a bit out of control and is taking over. But who knows, really? And what's with the human foetus in the apple? It's put me right off apples, to be honest. It's pacy, and it all looks fabulously exciting. I just wonder - what with Heroes and Prison Break on our screens, too - whether we have room in our lives for another big-budget rollercoaster US import. I think you have to chose one, two at most, and commit. The Story of the Guitar (BBC1, Sunday) was - is, because there are two more to come - a treat. A history lesson, with some joyous old clips, and contributions from loads of top axe men (though I think Jack White would have been better than Jack Black - does that make me racist?). Here's my one little moan: the storyteller is Alan Yentob. Here you have the coolest instrument in the world, a symbol of rebellion and sex and lord knows what else. And showing us round it is this bearded, middle-aged, establishment BBC man. That's all wrong. Like being told about sex by your dad.
