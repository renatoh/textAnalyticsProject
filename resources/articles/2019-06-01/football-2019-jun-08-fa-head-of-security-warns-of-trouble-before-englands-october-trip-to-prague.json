Tony Conniford admitted he was \u201cdeeply embarrassed\u201d by the bad behaviour of a section of England fans who threw bottles at police in Porto and were abusive to locals \u2013 and conceded it could easily happen again the next time England travel abroad. \u201cPrague on a Friday night. I am not going to stand here and say I am confident about that because I\u2019m not,\u201d he said. \u201cPrague is a well-known city for welcoming stag dos. I think it\u2019s tried to change that image but that is a concern for me. \u201cPerhaps moving forward, when draws like that are made, like we do in England, if there is a potential issue then perhaps the authorities need to look at that and say: \u2018Is England travelling to the Czech Republic on a Friday night the best thing for the game?\u2019\u201d Conniford also admitted he was increasingly concerned about far-right groups such as the English Defence League attaching themselves to the national team because it was \u201cfashionable\u201d and tarnishing its image as a result. \u201cI\u2019m extremely worried that we\u2019ve got the groups that I saw on social media, and the images portrayed across the world associating themselves with the national team,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause that causes me problems when I go to a country. \u201cFor example, we\u2019re going to Kosovo, where England haven\u2019t played before. I\u2019ve been to countries where their briefing to police officers is to show them footage of that sort of behaviour. That ups the ante straight away. So fans are met with riot police and dogs before they even get off the plane. \u201cWe got rid of that. We turned it around so people were welcome. So yes, I\u2019m worried about those groups tarnishing what we achieved. Do I know the solution? I don\u2019t in this moment in time and I\u2019d be lying to you if I said I did.\u201d Conniford, however, praised the Portuguese police who he hailed for doing everything possible to help England fans enjoy the Nations League. \u201cIt has been a real disappointment for me because I asked the supporters to respect the country. Sadly a group decided they weren\u2019t going to do that. I want genuine people to come and everything was laid on for this to be a special event and unfortunately what we saw the other night deeply embarrassed me as an Englishman and didn\u2019t bring us any favours.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
