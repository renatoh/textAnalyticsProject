Godsiff, the MP for the Birmingham Hall Green constituency, which is home to Anderton Park primary school, also told protesters they had a \u201cjust cause\u201d, as he criticised the headteacher. His remarks outraged party colleagues and led to calls for him to lose the Labour whip. After weeks of megaphone-led protests at the school, the council successfully applied for a high court interim injunction which banned demonstrations outside the gates for the first time on Friday. Protesters have objected to the school\u2019s use of particular relationship education materials, claiming the teaching is \u201cover-emphasising a gay ethos\u201d. The school\u2019s headteacher, Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson, has called the demonstrations \u201ctoxic and nasty\u201d, and said she has received threats since they started. Godsiff first waded into the row last month, saying he understood the protesters\u2019 concerns. Now, in his latest comments, appearing in a video widely circulated on social media, Godsiff declared: \u201cI believe in telling it as I see it.\u201d Flanked by the main organiser of the protests, Shakeel Afsar, the MP then said: \u201cIf I had the opportunity of rolling the clock back I would do exactly the same thing again. Because I think you have a just cause and I regret the fact that it hasn\u2019t been reciprocated by the headteacher.\u201d Godsiff then asked demonstrators to \u201cconsider calling the protest off\u201d as they had made their point, but added it would be their choice to do so. He then said: \u201cI will continue to try and fight your corner because you\u2019re right. Nothing more, nothing less. You\u2019re right.\u201d Wes Streeting, the Labour MP for Ilford North, said he would be tabling a formal complaint to the party about Godsiff. In a series of tweets, he said: \u201cThis made me feel sick to my stomach. One of my own Labour colleagues stood with people who have peddled hatred and bigotry on school gates, intimidating pupils, teachers and parents.\u201d The LGBT Labour group, at its annual general meeting, voted to condemn Godsiff\u2019s remarks and called for the party whip to be removed. Labour councillors from Birmingham city council also rounded on Godsiff. The deputy council leader, Brigid Jones, tweeted: \u201cHow dare you tell men whose homophobic protests were so threatening and disruptive that they had a court injunction issued against them that they are \u2018right\u2019.\u201d A petition calling on the constituency Labour party to deselect Godsiff had, at time of writing, gained 1,000 signatures. The education secretary, Damian Hinds, has previously called for the \u201cunacceptable\u201d demonstrations to end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
