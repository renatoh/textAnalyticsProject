Citigroup, Bank of America and Merrill Lynch stumbled steeply into loss-making territory as the capital markets went into meltdown amid deteriorating economic conditions in the final quarter of 2008. Under severe pressure to stabilise their firms, banking bosses took radical action. Citigroup in effect ditched its strategy of becoming a \"global universal bank\" in favour of splitting its operations in two \u2013 a strategy dubbed as \"good bank and bad bank\". Meanwhile, Bank of America's decision to buy the brokerage Merrill Lynch looked increasingly ill considered as the firm nicknamed the \"thundering herd\" ran up losses of $15.3bn in its final quarter as an independent institution. The US government was obliged to step in with aid of $20bn to persuade Bank of America to stick with its purchase. Between them, Citigroup, Bank of America and Merrill lost a sum exceeding the annual gross domestic profit of Ethiopia. They haemorrhaged money at a rate of $280m a day \u2013 or $11m an hour. The size and speed of the losses indicated that the credit crunch is getting worse, rather than easing, with credit cards joining mortgages and credit derivatives among firms' most troublesome operations. Citigroup, which lost $8.29bn, said its results had been \"clearly disappointing\", although there was no sign of a rumoured boardroom putsch against its embattled chief executive, Vikram Pandit. \"For much of the year, we've been dealing with dysfunctional markets which deteriorated even further after Labour Day,\" said Pandit, referring to a tumultuous few weeks in September sparked by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. Citigroup is hiving off its brokerage, retail asset management business and \"special asset\" pool into a unit called Citi Holdings, to ring-fence its liabilities. It will keep its high street, corporate and mainstream investment banking in an entity called Citicorp. \"Funding and capital markets have changed fundamentally,\" said Pandit, who defended his change of direction since telling investors in May that he was committed to an integrated corporation. \"The world is a different place from May, especially post-Lehman Brothers.\" There was a similar degree of pressure on Bank of America's boss, Ken Lewis, whose firm had dodged the worst of the carnage wrought by the credit crunch. Bank of America revealed that it had suffered a quarterly loss of $2.3bn but this was dwarfed by the liabilities discovered at newly acquired Merrill Lynch. On a conference call, Lewis admitted that he had not anticipated a \"significant deterioration\" in Merrill's finances that occurred in mid to late December. He was persuaded to stick with the transaction by the treasury and the Federal Reserve, which are anxious to avert the failure of any more Wall Street firms. \"The government was firmly of the view that terminating or delaying the closing of the transaction could lead to significant concerns and could result in significant systemic harm,\" said Lewis. \"We just thought it was in the best interest of our company and our shareholders and the country to move forward.\" To shore up Bank of America's balance sheet, the Treasury pumped in $20bn in return for preferred stock, adding to a $25bn infusion last year. The government is also protecting the firm against losses of up to $118bn from bad loans and mortgages \u2013 largely within Merrill Lynch. Some believe that Lewis could pay a personal price from the deal. Paul Miller, an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, told Bloomberg News that Bank of America's management had lost credibility. \"This thing is unravelling so fast Lewis may know his job is lost.\" On top of a meltdown in the mortgage market, experts are becoming increasingly concerned about banks' exposure to bad debt on credit cards. As the unemployment rate rises, a surging number of jobless cardholders are struggling to make repayments. Late on Thursday, Congress voted to release the second half of the Treasury's $700bn bail-out fund to Barack Obama's incoming administration. Much of the money is likely to be needed to stabilise banks \u2013 Brian Bethune, chief financial economist at IHS Global Insight, estimated that $200bn to $250bn would need to go into the stricken banking system. \"The main problem that we are dealing with now is a rapidly deteriorating economic environment that is putting additional downward pressure on bank capital,\" said Bethune. Fundraising through private sources has become virtually impossible for the banking industry, which commands little confidence among investors."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
