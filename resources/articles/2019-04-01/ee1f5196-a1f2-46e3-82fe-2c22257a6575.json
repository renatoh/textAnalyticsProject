An estimated 60,000 children in England are thought to be educated at home \u2013 a figure that is rising by about a quarter each year. The register will for the first time enable authorities to see where children are if they are not in school and intervene more effectively if required. The proposals, which will be outlined by the education secretary, Damian Hinds, on Tuesday, are intended to address concerns about soaring numbers of children out of school, particularly those who have been \u201coff-rolled\u201d or are attending illegal schools. Although the move was welcomed by Ofsted, the schools watchdog, it is likely to infuriate many people in the home education community who are providing their children with a sound education and object in principle to state interference in family matters. The Department for Education (DfE) is hoping to offset some of their concerns by promising home-educating parents additional support, including teaching resources or help from their local authority to pay for exam costs. Home educator Edward Hardy warned, however, that the community would fight the plans every step of the way. \u201cThe register will not protect children from parents who are intent on harming their children. Instead, it will amount to a further step down the path of unwarranted intrusion into family life by the state,\u201d he said. Under the proposals, which will be subject to a 12-week consultation, it will be parents\u2019 responsibility to register their child if they are not being taught in a state-funded or registered independent school. The government says the register is not intended to crack down on home educators, but to protect vulnerable children who may remain hidden from the authorities and those in illegal schools where they could come under \u201cdangerous influences\u201d. As now, if a local authority has concerns that a child is not receiving a suitable education, they can use school attendance orders to compel parents to send their child to a registered school, which can escalate to a prosecution if a family fails to comply. Announcing the plans, Hinds said: \u201cAs a government, we have a duty to protect our young people and do our utmost to make sure they are prepared for life in modern Britain. \u201cThat\u2019s why this register of children not in school is so important \u2013 not to crack down on those dedicated parents doing an admirable job of educating their children in their own homes, but to prevent vulnerable young people from vanishing under the radar.\u201d The Local Government Association, which represents councils, welcomed the register, but called on the government to go further and give local authorities the powers and funding to enter homes or other premises to check a child\u2019s schooling. The children\u2019s charity NSPCC said a register alone would not automatically safeguard children. \u201cThere must also be regular checks just like any other education setting to ensure that children are being properly looked after when they learn,\u201d a spokesperson said. Head of Ofsted and chief inspector of schools in England, Amanda Spielman, said: \u201cOfsted has long had concerns about the increasing numbers of school-age children not attending a registered school, many of whom may not be receiving a high-quality education or being kept safe. \u201cWe are especially concerned about children \u2018off-rolled\u2019 from schools, and those in illegal schools. The new register will make it easier to detect and tackle these serious problems.\u201d The children\u2019s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, said: \u201cIt is vitally important that we know that all children are safe and that they are receiving the education they deserve to help them to succeed in life. The introduction of a register for children not in school is very welcome and something I been calling for. I am pleased these proposals also include support for families.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 9 April 2019 to make it clear that the estimated figures for home schooled children \u2013 and thus the proposals \u2013 relate to England and not the UK as a whole."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
