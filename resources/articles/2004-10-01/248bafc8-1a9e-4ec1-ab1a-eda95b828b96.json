When Ronnie Carroll, a music hall crooner and independent candidate (45 votes; finished 13th of 14), chose to sing Danny Boy rather than make a speech, a charged atmosphere slipped into the anarchically surreal. Rumours swept the hall that the Fathers4Justice supporters in Superman suits were planning to storm the podium. Police and security closed in. But the stunt, when it came, was as predictable as it was shocking - a purple powder bomb flung at Jody Dunn, by the Fathers4Justice candidate, Paul Watson. The Lib Dem candidate struggled to continue with her speech, but it was lost in the heckles, and she was led from the podium in tears. In the stunned hiatus, Mr Watson was allowed to deliver his speech, before being arrested and led away. When Ms Dunn, a family law barrister who believes she may have represented the ex-wife of a Fathers4Justice activist, returned to give interviews in the press gallery, police had to block the stairwells to prevent the cartoon superheroes pursuing her. But by yesterday morning attention had shifted to the night's more enduring shock. The Tories had become the first official opposition party since the second world war to come fourth in a byelection. \"Tactical voting, without a doubt,\" was the line coming out of their campaign HQ. \"People had identified the Lib Dems early on as the party to get rid of Labour.\" But the party workers heading off to Bournemouth know it will not be so easily explained away at conference. Iain Duncan Smith was deposed following the Brent East byelection last year, when the Tory vote fell by 3%. On Thursday, the drop was 11%. The Lib Dems were not hiding their disappointment, for they had genuinely believed they could win. Lord Rennard, the party chief executive, was still dispensing optimism - they had narrowed the majority to about 2,000 from 17,000 - but the \"real victory\" of the night was the collapse of the Tory vote. The narrowness of Labour's victory tempered celebrations but they were ecstatic at the Tories' fourth place. \"The result is a disaster for Michael Howard,\" Iain Wright rejoiced in his acceptance speech."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
