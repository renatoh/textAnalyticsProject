David Humphreys\u2019 side will now play Edinburgh for the Challenge Cup, pitching the captain of the Ulster side that won the senior European competition, then the Heineken Cup, in 1999 against Alan Solomons, the South African who subsequently coached the Irish province for three seasons. More importantly it injects life into an otherwise disappointing season for Gloucester. After scrambling seven wins from 19 starts in the Premiership \u2013 they are currently ninth in the table \u2013 and just when agents have been appointed to seek out new investors they have the chance of European silverware for the first time since 2006, when they won this title, and a possible route to the senior competition. A win against Edinburgh at the Twickenham Stoop in two weeks would set up play-offs against the candidates from the Celtic Pro12 and then the French league for a seventh English club slot in the Champions Cup and a backdoor reward for a side put together at considerable expense by Nigel Davies before the Welsh coach was sacked to make way for Humphreys last summer. In turn Humphreys had to put together a new coaching staff less than a month before the season started with a 53-6 thumping at Northampton and the relief at getting something from his first term in charge was obvious. \u201cIt was a complete performance from the first minute to the last,\u201d said Gloucester\u2019s director of rugby, who is adamant new ownership would not affect plans already laid down. On Saturday the side he inherited from Davies for once played for a full 80 minutes, extending the one-point lead they held with 13 minutes to go and, through the wing Jonny May, scoring a third and final try when Exeter, through the replacement hooker Elvis Taione, again put the result in doubt. \u201cWe didn\u2019t panic,\u201d said Humphreys. \u201cOur set piece was strong and we defended well when they came back at us, as I knew they would. Our league position is not an accurate reflection of our season as we are a better team than that.\u201d Exeter were left to aim for the Champions Cup by a more orthodox route. They are currently fourth in the league, but between them and a Premiership play-off place come tricky trips to Wasps and Saracens before the final game at home to Sale. Saturday was Exeter\u2019s fourth meeting with Gloucester this season with the clubs sharing the honours, though the 11-point winning margin was considerably greater than any before. Gloucester got their noses in front, then extended their lead when the centre Bill Meakes chased down a clever kick from James Hook. They then reinforced it with two brave decisions from their captain, Billy Twelvetrees. With the lead down to a point, Twelvetrees opted to kick away the possibility of three points and got his reward when the second-row Tom Savage scrambled over. A penalty from Greig Laidlaw then pushed the lead out to 11 points and despite the late exchange of tries that is where the margin stayed. \u201cWe won\u2019t be changing anything radically as a result of this defeat,\u201d said Rob Baxter, Exeter\u2019s head coach acknowledging that Gloucester were the better side. \u201cWe are having an exciting season and there will be no need to pick the players up.\u201d Gloucester Sharples; May, Meakes, Twelvetrees (capt), Purdy; Hook, Laidlaw; Wood (Murphy 60), Hibbard (Dawidiuk 76), Afoa, Savage, Galarza (Stook 78), Kalafamoni, Kvesic, Evans (Moriarty 9).
