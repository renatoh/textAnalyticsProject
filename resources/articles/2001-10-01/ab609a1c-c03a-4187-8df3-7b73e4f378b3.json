Giving evidence to the Commons home affairs select committee, he stopped short of committing the government to legislating on proposals by Sir Robin Auld to remove defendants' right to elect jury trial for a range of middle-ranking offences, which he acknowledged were controversial. But he pointed out that the present system for dealing with \"either way\" offences, which can be tried by magistrates or judge and jury, originated in a statute of 1980. Sir Robin has recommended that defendants should lose the right to choose jury trial for \"either way\" cases, and that cases meriting a sentence of up to two years in prison should be tried by a district judge and two lay magistrates. Lord Irvine said the government hoped to produce a white paper on the Auld proposals by the spring, but legislation was unlikely during this parliamentary session."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
