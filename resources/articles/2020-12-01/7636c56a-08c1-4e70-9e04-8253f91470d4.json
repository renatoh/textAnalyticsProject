It was to \u201cgive him space\u201d, the president-elect told CNN for a documentary about vice-presidents, President in Waiting, which will broadcast on Saturday night with contributions from all five living former VPs: Biden, Dick Cheney, Al Gore, Dan Quayle and Walter Mondale. Biden\u2019s advice about the Bin Laden raid has long been a source of controversy. During this year\u2019s election, which Biden won decisively over Donald Trump, Republican attack ads claimed the former vice-president opposed taking out the al-Qaida leader altogether. Biden\u2019s version of events had shifted, from saying he advised Obama to wait to saying he told him to go. Obama\u2019s version of events was thus keenly awaited, and the raid duly formed the culmination of A Promised Land, the former president\u2019s 700-plus-page memoir which was published two weeks after the election last month. \u201cJoe weighed in against the raid,\u201d Obama writes, adding that Biden and defense secretary Robert Gates were concerned about \u201cthe enormous consequences of failure\u201d and counselled that the president \u201cshould defer any decision until the intelligence community was more certain that Bin Laden was in the compound\u201d. Speaking to CNN, Biden echoed Obama. \u201cThe president went around the room,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there were 17 people around the table: national security adviser, secretary of state, CIA, chairman of the joint chiefs, all the way to the secretary of defense, etc. \u201cThree people gave him an absolute. What do you think we should do? Everybody in the room was like, \u2018You know, 60-40, 49-51, etc.\u201d Two said go, and one said don\u2019t go. And I\u2019m the last person.\u201d Obama also writes about the deal he made with Biden when he picked him as his running mate in 2008: that the vastly experienced senator from Delaware, 19 years Obama\u2019s senior and a former chair of the foreign relations committee, would be his last source of advice on all major decisions. \u201cIn my view,\u201d Biden told CNN, \u201cthere was one option there that was remaining: you could have done one more very low flight \u2026 spying down on the site\u201d \u2013 a compound in Abbottabad \u2013 \u201cto determine whether this was Bin Laden, because again, there was no certainty. \u201c \u2026 And so I looked around the table, I said, \u2018I didn\u2019t think we had this many economists in the room. On the one hand, the other hand.\u2019 I said, \u2018Mr President,\u2019 to give him space, I said, \u2018I think you should wait.\u2019 And do one more pass.\u2019 Knowing that if you made the lower pass, they might observe it and he\u2019d flee.\u201d Again echoing Obama, Biden said he and the president had a subsequent private discussion in which he advised the president to follow his instinct. In the event, Obama ordered a Navy Seal team to fly from Afghanistan to Pakistan, where they shot dead the al-Qaida leader, the head of the group behind the 9/11 attacks, who was swiftly buried at sea. \u201cAs had been true in every major decision I\u2019d made as president,\u201d Obama writes, \u201cI appreciated Joe\u2019s willingness to buck the prevailing mood and ask tough questions, often in the interest of giving me the space I needed for my own internal deliberations.\u201d Biden told CNN Obama \u201crisked his entire presidency\u201d on making the call. \u201cIt took real, real, real courage to make that decision,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd had this decision gone wrong, had he not been there, had it failed, I doubt whether the 17 people around that table would\u2019ve said, \u2018I told him he should go.\u2019 \u201cI was trying to preserve space for him. But the end of the day, that old Harry Truman phrase: \u2018The buck stops here\u2019? It stopped here. And it was a consequential decision showing this man\u2019s courage and determination, at the risk of his entire presidency. \u201cHe\u2019d follow Bin Laden to the gates of Hell to get him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
