But in Curios (with bassist Sam Burgess and drummer Josh Blackmore), Cawley stays as close to jazz piano-trio parameters as Brad Mehldau or John Taylor might. Curios is touring to launch its debut disc, Hidden, and the startling promise of that album glows all the more brightly live. Bassist Burgess has the rhythmic assurance to anchor the band, but also the full-toned high-register sound and nimbleness to duck out of that role into free-flowing dialogue, while Derby drummer Blackmore, a young UK jazz sensation, is a flawless performer. Like EST, Curios sometimes favours slow-build accumulations of rolling piano vamps amid swells of percussion. Cawley will then drop back to a Bill Evans-like brood, with clipped and glancing figures skimming off hissing brushes-patterns from Blackmore. In the first half, the pianist explored this mood before cranking it up into flying long lines, Blackmore switching to sticks and firing off edgy rimshots. A semi-classical, faintly Jacques Loussier-like feel opened the second set, drifting into a Latin groove and then a tribute to Rufus Wainwright's opera-influenced Barcelona. After gliding through a lovely ballad original, Lullaby, Cawley thanked the Vortex crowd for letting them \"lose ourselves\" in the music. Transported they (and the audience) undoubtedly were. Lost they most certainly were not. \u00b7 At the Darwin Suite, Assembly Rooms, Derby (01332 255800), on Wednesday as part of Derby Jazz Week"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
