Colorectal cancer drugs are about \u00a320,000.\" We should have made clear that he was saying treatments could be up to these maximum sums (Emergency fund to pay for 'too expensive' cancer drugs, 28 July, page 8). \u2022 In a piece about damages awarded in a court case where a member of an Afghan family sued the author of The Bookseller of Kabul, \u00c5sne Seierstad, we omitted to mention where the proceedings took place \u2013 Oslo district court (Brought to book: Kabul author guilty of 'betraying' a nation, 28 July, page 11). \u2022 It was runner Chris Thompson, not his team-mate Mo Farah, who said after winning a silver medal in the 10,000 metres in Barcelona on Tuesday: \"I felt like I was in the coliseum with all the noise and the cheering\" (Golden moment, 28 July, page 1, Sport). \u2022 Baited breath, which featured in this column's homophone corner on 24 July, made further appearances in yesterday's paper. In a football piece, we twice had Aston Villa's Martin O'Neill waiting \"with baited breath\" (City refusing to meet asking price for Milner deal, claims O'Neill, 28 July, page 4, Sport). A comment piece mentioned \"waiting with baited breath\" for a pronouncement by the chief UN weapons inspector in Iraq (Too late, Blix, too late, 28 July, page 30). \u2022 This column was amended on 29 July. The original referred to Manchester City's Martin O'Neill. This has been corrected, and a print correction will also follow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
