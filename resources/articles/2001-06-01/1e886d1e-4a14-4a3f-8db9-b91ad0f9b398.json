While McClaren, who was appointed Middlesbrough manager earlier this week, has been given permission by his new employers to continue working as a part-time member of Eriksson's coaching team, Taylor has bowed to pressure from Leicester City to concentrate solely on managing the club. Taylor wanted to continue working part-time with Eriksson but City appear to have made it clear they were not prepared for the arrangement to continue. They told Taylor they would not release him for England's next friendly against Holland, scheduled for three days before the start of the Premiership campaign. \"I have always said that my England involvement did not affect my duties with Leicester City and I am still firmly of that opinion,\" said Taylor. \"However, there are those who choose to think otherwise. I have discussed the situation at length with John Elsom and we have agreed that I should stand down from future involvement with England.\" Meanwhile McClaren, who has already had discussions with the Derby County coach Steve Round about joining him at the Riverside, looks set to add to his coaching team there with Aston Villa s assistant manager Steve Harrison and the club's goalkeeping coach Paul Barron. Villa may also lose out in their bid to sign the Coventry City midfielder Moustapha Hadji after Bryan Richardson, the Coventry chairman, said two other Premiership clubs were after him. Arsenal are thought to have offered Rangers \u00a37m for the Dutch midfielder Giovanni van Bronckhorst. Newcastle United are interested in Barcelona's Dutch international winger Boudewijn Zenden and are willing to offer the Spanish defender Marcelino plus \u00a38m in an exchange deal. Blackburn Rovers today hope to finalise the \u00a36.3m purchase of Ternana's Corrado Grabbi, Serie B's top scorer this season. Chesterfield's financial crisis could finally be over after a high court hearing in Manchester in which the court approved proposals from administrators to settle debts with the club's creditors. The club hopes to be able to write off its debts before next season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
