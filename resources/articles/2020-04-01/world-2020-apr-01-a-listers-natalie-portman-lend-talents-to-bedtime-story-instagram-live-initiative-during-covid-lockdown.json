But now the online cultural arms race has shifted to another, less likely target: the humble bedtime story. Several Hollywood actors, music stars and politicians have become children\u2019s storytellers in an effort to support charities and bring some levity during the Covid-19 outbreak, as experts extol the importance of regular routines for parents and children. Natalie Portman, Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Reese Witherspoon have all signed up to an Instagram Live initiative started by fellow actors Amy Adams and Jennifer Garner called Save With Stories, where celebrities read bedtime stories and appeal for donations to Save the Children and No Kid Hungry. In a post on Instagram, Jake Gyllenhaal, who read a Jamie Lee Curtis story called Where Do Balloons Go?, wrote that the charities would \u201csupport food banks, and mobile meal trucks, and community feeding programs\u201d to help the estimated 30 million US children who rely on school meals. The show has more than 120,000 followers and the videos have been viewed more than 27m times, with an estimated 18,000 donations so far. \u201cI don\u2019t have any children, but I\u2019ve been watching the videos,\u201d Betsy Zorio, the head of Save the Children\u2019s US programmes and advocacy, told the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cThey\u2019ve become a nice little way to take a break during the day and get your mind off the shortage of toilet paper.\u201d On Thursday, Dolly Parton will start her own weekly online storytelling programme by reading The Little Engine That Could. The country star and Glastonbury favourite said the Goodnight With Dolly series on YouTube should act as \u201ca welcome distraction during a time of unrest and also inspire a love of reading and books\u201d. Parton\u2019s charity Imagination Library, which she started in 1996, has delivered more than 130m free books to children, making her known simply as \u201cthe book lady\u201d to a generation who might have never heard her songs such as Jolene. Unorthodox choices to get children off to sleep are nothing new. Before the Covid-19 outbreak, the BBC recruited the likes of the Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme, the Batman and Venom star Tom Hardy and the Captain America actor Chris Evans as narrators for its CBeebies Bedtime Story. With coronavirus perhaps leaving stars with as little to do as much of the rest of the population, a swathe of other names are now doing the same. Other celebrities recruited for the Save the Children campaign include Jimmy Fallon and Gal Gadot, who has already had one Covid-19 viral moment when she appeared in a much maligned celebrity-packed cover version of John Lennon\u2019s Imagine. The bedtime story trend has reached beyond the usual celebrity circles, with the former attorney general and Conservative MP Geoffrey Cox adding his name to the list of night-time narrators. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked to record a children\u2019s bedtime story for while we are cooped up in CV confinement,\u201d he wrote in a tweet introducing his story. Cox chose The Stone Monkey, a Chinese fairytale told by the Victorian author and Chinese language and culture scholar Herbert Allen Giles in what Cox described as \u201ca beautiful little pamphlet\u201d of tales published in 1911. \u201cI hope you enjoy it,\u201d he added. Before becoming attorney general under Theresa May, Cox was arguably best known for having the highest outside earnings in parliament, because he continued to work as a QC while serving as an MP in Devon. Now the politician, whose booming oration was described as sounding like \u201cUncle Monty played by Brian Blessed\u201d, has joined the ranks of well-known bedtime storytellers. There were suggestions Cox should start narrating audiobooks after a clip of him reading A Visit from St Nicholas, more commonly known as \u2018Twas The Night Before Christmas, was widely circulated in December last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
