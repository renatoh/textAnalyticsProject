The central defender, who has signed a four-year contract at Molineux, revealed that he has been named in Fabio Capello's last four provisional squads, only to fail to make the final 23. After enduring what he described as a \"crazy\" season with relegated Birmingham, Johnson was desperate to make a swift return to the Premier League to keep his England ambitions alive. He pointed to Capello's decision to call up the Wolves winger Matt Jarvis towards the end of last season and the encouraging words he has received from Franco Baldini, Capello's assistant, as reasons to believe he can make the step up. \"I spoke to Franco Baldini. He rang and said: 'Keep doing what you're doing, you're close',\"Johnson said. \"I got in the last four provisional England squads but missed out on the cut. It's disappointing when you get in the 30-man squad and it gets cut to 23. You're waiting for that phone call, then you find out that you're not in it. But to get that call and actually be in the full squad would be a great day. \"England was a factor in the decision to come here,\" he said. \"It's then down to me to perform to the standard the England manager wants. Hopefully, now that I've stayed in the Premier League, with the manager watching games, I can fight for that position. It's realistic, I'm that close [and] Matt Jarvis got in the squad last season so the manager will pick players from these clubs if they're doing well enough.\" Johnson, whose form at Birmingham seemed to suffer when his defensive partner Scott Dann was sidelined for the final four months of the season, described relegation as \"heartbreaking\". He refused to accept, however, that the League Cup final victory had contributed to their slump in form in the league in the closing stages of the season, suggesting instead that injuries, below-par individual performances and a chronic lack of goals were to blame. \"It's been a weird old story,\" Johnson said. \"It was crazy. From finishing ninth the season before, it didn't really happen. The [League] Cup was fantastic and thoroughly deserved but I won't blame that for us going down, that wasn't the reason at all. We had injuries and people not playing to their best level \u2013 it took its toll in the end. Everyone can see there was a lack of goals. It was difficult, without hanging the forwards out, it was fairly obvious.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
