The British sprinter wins, then accuses the Dutch rider Kenny van Hummel of punching him in the kidneys, mid-stage. \"I'm going to have a word with him,\" says Cavendish, darkly. It later transpires it wasn't Van Hummel but his team-mate, Piet Rooijakkers, who threw the punch. This is possibly a stroke of luck for Cav; Van Hummel's team director describes him as \"a street fighter\".An unfortunate postscript is that Rooijakkers crashes two days later, breaking his arm in three places, requiring seven hours of surgery, including a bone graft from his hip. Bad karma, or what? Monday As the riders file through the crowds to sign on by the port in Marseille, there is no sign of Lance Armstrong. Finally he appears, but too late to avoid a fine of \u20ac65 (\u00a356). That will really hurt him. Armstrong was detained by Ben Stiller, who was following in the celebrity footsteps of Jake Gyllenhaal, Ben Harper, Robin Williams, Matt Damon, Will Smith and Sheryl Crow, his former girlfriend, all of whom dropped in during previous Tours. Old-timers murmur disapproval at behaviour they consider unbecoming, while craning their necks to catch a glimpse of the stars. (Crow was more popular than Stiller). Tuesday The team time trial, starting and finishing in Montpellier, presents a first opportunity to get our folding bikes out. Yes, three commuter-style Dahon bikes, that pack neatly into the car boot for our three-week jaunt and provide the ideal mode of transport for the 3km between start and finish. Most surreal moment comes while flying in our mini peloton, along a cycle path, keeping pace with Cadel Evans's Silence-Lotto team. Admittedly, we realise later that they were waiting for a crash victim, but still! Wednesday Le Cap d'Agde is a resort surrounded by attractive beaches and populated by less-than-attractive bodies. It is home to Europe's largest nudist colony. Perhaps this explains the late arrival of the Garmin-Slipstream team of Bradley Wiggins and David Millar. As the clock ticks towards the start time of 12.45pm, there's no sign. Finally, the Garmin cavalcade appears. They had taken a wrong turning. (NB: Garmin make satellite navigation systems.) Thursday The Tour's VIP 'village' in Girona resembles a cr\u00e8che. Half the peloton lives here, drawn by its transport links and good training roads. Assorted wives and girlfriends drop by with the kids. In the Wag department, cyclists' partners are broadly \u2013 or should that be slenderly \u2013 similar to other sporting Wags, though they are probably longer-suffering than many, given that cyclists race up to 100 days a year. Friday The Tour de Tax Havens continues, with Andorra, sandwiched between Monaco and Switzerland on the tour schedule, seeming like a throwback to a previous era. With no room for the team buses at the summit, the riders cross the line, grab a jacket, turn around and ride back down the hill to their hotels \u2013 even Armstrong. That's a change from the helicopter waiting to whisk him away. Saturday Tom Boonen, the Belgian champion, won an eleventh hour appeal against his exclusion from the Tour, following his third out-of-competition positive test for cocaine. After a miserable week of punctures and crashes he must be wondering if it was worth it. At today's stage start in Saint-Girons he can barely move without grimacing after his heavy crash in the rain on Thursday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
