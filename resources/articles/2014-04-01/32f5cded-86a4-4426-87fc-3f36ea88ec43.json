Not this time, though, now that he\u2019s hung up his playing boots. As BBC Worldwide recently announced, the former England star travelled to the Brazilian Amazon last month to make a 90 minute documentary film to explore \u201cthe isolation of the rainforest\u201d, to experience life there, and to \u201cdiscover the \u201creal Brazil\u201d.\u201d \u201cThis is an unforgettable documentary set in the heart of the dense Amazon rainforest following David Beckham,\u201d a BBC Worldwide statement reported Helen Jackson, the Managing Director for Content, saying. \u201cThrough his eyes, audiences will experience life in the jungle, something so distant from David\u2019s life on and off the pitch and in the glare of the world\u2019s media.\u201d But where did Beckham go exactly, and, more importantly, how will his film \u2013 due to be distributed abroad and shown on BBC One in June in the run-up to the World Cup held in Brazil \u2013 portray the Amazon and the people living there? According to BBC One\u2019s Charlotte Moore, also quoted in the BBC Worldwide\u2019s statement, Beckham\u2019s expedition was, or is, \u201ctop-secret.\u201d However, photos of him meeting a Yanomami leader, Davi Yanomami \u2013 posted online by Yanomami organization Hutukara and distributed worldwide by NGO Survival International \u2013 make it clear he paid a visit to their territory in northern Brazil and suggest some Yanomami will feature in the film, although the BBC Worldwide\u2019s communications office would not confirm that to me. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s not the all-too-common, intensely irritating celebrity program that spends way too much time on the celebrity and not enough time on where he or she\u2019s travelling or who he or she\u2019s meeting. And let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t fall into the several centuries-old trap of portraying the Amazon as a largely or overwhelmingly \u201cwild\u201d, \u201cpristine\u201d and \u201cempty\u201d \u201cland without history\u201d inhabited by a few groups of stereotyped, exoticised indigenous peoples \u2013 and no one else \u2013 where nothing much has happened for the last few 100 years and nothing at all until the first Europeans arrived. Multidisciplinary academic Susanna Hecht highlights this tendency in her recently-published book \u201cThe Scramble for the Amazon and the Lost Paradise of Euclides da Cunha\u201d, describing how what Brazilian writer da Cunha discovered during his expedition to the Amazon in the early 20th century was \u201ccompletely at odds with the northern European tropicalisms which favoured an \u201cempty\u201d world, a largely natural, wild place inhabited by indolent primitives.\u201d Indeed, Hecht calls the \u201cUpper Amazon\u201d at the time of da Cunha\u2019s expedition \u201cprobably as multicultural as any place on the planet,\u201d and about the 19th century she writes: The Amazon was the object of treaties, armed incursions, and roving battalions. . . and deeply integrated into global commodity circuits. European and hemispheric players were prowling in the environs, looking for an excuse to intervene. While travellers marveled at the grandeur of the \u201cuntrammelled\u201d Amazonian forests, at the time it was a geopolitical hot spot. So what do we want to see in a film about the Brazilian Amazon, or what should audiences in the UK or abroad learn about it? I put those two questions to Daniel Nepstad, a tropical forest ecologist who has studied the Amazon for years and is the lead author on chapter 4 of the new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Working Group (WG) II report. \u201cBrazil has done what no forest nation has achieved in history,\u201d Nepstad says. \u201cIt is the world leader in climate change mitigation because of the 70% reduction in deforestation in the Amazon that has been achieved since 2005. This has prevented about 3.2 billion tons of CO2 from going into the atmosphere and kept more than 80,000 km2 of rainforest standing.\u201d However, Nepstad acknowledges there is a \u201cdark cloud behind this impressive progress related to climate change itself\u201d, as summarized in his chapter of the IPCC WGII report. \u201cBasically, we no longer predict a late-century regional forest dieback driven by climate change in the Amazon,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead we predict a near-term regional forest degradation scenario, in which severe drought events \u2013 like we had in 2005, 2007 and 2010 \u2013 kill trees and make rainforests susceptible to fire, and which can kill up to half of the adult trees of the forest.\u201d I also put the same two questions to various Brazilian experts whose lives have been intimately linked with the Amazon, and what follows is some of what they told me. Eduardo Neves, archaeologist, University of Sao Paulo: The Amazon was fully and densely settled by the time the Europeans arrived in the Americas and these ancient fellows devised ingenious and apparently sustainable ways to live there. What I would most like to see in a film is the wonderful objects produced by the people who lived there in the past and which are now stored in museums in Brazil and abroad. Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, anthropologist, National Museum in Rio de Janeiro: The Amazon region is being turned into a provider of hydro-power to the rest of the country and a number of transnational, highly energy-intensive industrial concerns, and its immense rain forest is being transformed into cattle country and monocultural, deforested agricultural land in order to feed China and other rich countries. . . I\u2019m deeply disheartened to see that Brazil is losing its unique historical opportunity to create a tropically-oriented, ecologically sound, truly multicultural model of civilisation, and striving instead to mimic northern European socio-economic models \u2014 models that, besides being totally inadequate to Brazilian conditions, are proving themselves lethal to human and non-human environments. Felipe Milanez, political ecology researcher and former editor of National Geographic Brasil: A non-exotic film and the serious challenges of the Amazon and its people. This means showing a real place inhabited by people who are part of the ecosystem, and deserve to be part of any debate about its future. . . The Amazon is still a very violent place for those who live there and are not getting any benefit from the hundreds of dams that are being built or the massive extraction of its resources. Lucio Flavio Pinto, journalist, Jornal Pessoal: In 2011 there was a big flood in the Maranh\u00e3o lowlands, one of the poorest areas in Brazil, in one of the poorest states, despite being the birthplace of former president Jos\u00e9 Sarney. The local population was cut-off. A helicopter arrived but couldn\u2019t land because people were so starving and desperate, and so someone began to toss out food, medicine and clothing. A few kilometres away, the largest cargo train in the world, carrying the best iron ore on the planet from the Carajas mine, was also stopped by the flood. However, through a combination of money, technology and inventiveness, it was soon on its way again. About 500 men were contracted by the mining company Vale, the largest seller of iron ore in the world, to build dikes along the track and pump away the water. The train began to run again, earning US$30 million per day. Meanwhile, 1000s of Maranhenses were left to their fate. That\u2019s the real Amazon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
