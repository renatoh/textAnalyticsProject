I was setting out to ride 500 miles across Spain on a pilgrimage and I could not ride a horse, had never been to Mass and could not even speak Spanish. This great pass of the Pyrenees is the traditional entry point for pilgrims from France and the setting for the chivalrous medieval epic, The Song of Roland. It was here, on a bright morning last summer that we took delivery of two horses. I watched my girlfriend, Becca, an experienced horsewoman, saddle up her horse and did my best to copy her under the withering gaze of the Spanish horse dealer. The trip had been my idea, and yet I began to realise that not only was I mentally unprepared, I was physically unfit and spiritually unworthy. If God didn't kill me, my horse would. The Camino de Santiago, or Way of Saint James, is not one but a multitude of routes that meander across Europe to the Shrine of St James the Greater in Santiago de Compostela in the region of Galicia, north-western Spain. It is easier to picture it as a series of rivers flowing into one another until they reach the city. The major route is the Camino Frances, or French Way, that takes pilgrims over the Pyrenees and across the north of Spain. Villages, towns and cities were constructed along the way as it has carried a billion people to and from one of Europe's principal shrines during the course of its 1,000-year history. The camino is a path in the most spiritual sense of the word. To the true believer, a pilgrimage begins at his own doorstep and the path is viewed as a spiritual extension of the aisle of Santiago's cathedral itself. We made our way down through the foothills of the Pyrenees, along tiny paths in pine forests and down single tracks through small villages. Those first few days were a blur, as we struggled to get to grips with the practicalities of the trail: finding places to camp, food for ourselves and the horses, and places to wash. We didn't have much time to ourselves, but all that changed in Pamplona. This was the Spain I knew. I had run the bulls here years ago during the fiesta of St Fermin and seen my first pilgrims, who looked all the more angelic through the haze of a sangria hangover. We galloped along the city walls, underneath the ramparts, up to the gate and across the drawbridge. There is not a better sound in the world than horse hooves on a drawbridge - it felt heroic, outrageously romantic and, above all, perfectly Spanish. People stopped to watch: mothers leaning from balconies called out to their children; children ran to get their friends. The sound, as we clattered along the polished cobblestones through narrow streets, drew men out of the bars, caf\u00e9s and barber shops. In that moment it became clear, from the expressions of those in the crowd, that we were doing something very special, far larger than ourselves, that touched a very deep chord in Spain. They didn't see me, they saw 1,000 years of pilgrims, romance, and legend; and I felt like a two-bit actor unfit for the starring role. It was our first inkling of the importance and pride that those who live along its route invest in the Camino. It is not merely a path, it is holy ground. The generosity we were shown was staggering, and we found it hard to pay for anything. Instead, they asked us to light a candle for them when we reached Santiago. As we covered more ground, our confidence grew and we found a rhythm to our days. We meandered through the low hills, past vineyards and almond groves, along roads and narrow paths perched between cliffs of wild honeysuckle and dog rose, above seas of grain. Each morning we would break camp, fill up on coffee and fruit and walk the horses till we had all limbered up. We would then ride till lunch, pick up some more supplies and find some shade to sit out the worst of the day's heat. Saddles would be removed, the horses would graze and we would sleep and read. At about 4pm, we would start up again, ride for a few more hours and try and find a place to camp by 7pm - this was the most difficult part of the day. The camp had to be close to water and have enough space to pitch the tent and graze the horses. As a result, we often found ourselves in churchyards or on village commons. We encountered the most beautiful church of the entire pilgrimage at San Juan de Ortega. It was our second week, and we were coming through the forests of the Montes de Oca and riding before a massive storm front that was bearing down on us from the south. When the wind finally hit, we thought the forest was on fire, but the yellow smoke that filled the air was pine-pollen. The air was thick with it, and when the rain came the path turned into a yellow river, and everything smelt of resin. We reached San Juan - a small collection of houses around a monastery and a church - as the rain stopped, made camp in a field beneath a large oak and ran to Mass. The Romanesque church housed the tomb of St John of the Nettle, who had earned his name clearing the path we had just come down. Painted dragons fought on the ceiling, a statue of St John lay under an elaborate stone canopy, or baldachino . The small priest stood before a Gothic shrine, a gift from Isabel la Catolica herself, lit by the evening sun through the alabaster windows. With the horses safe in an enclosed field, this was our first chance to have a drink with some other pilgrims we had seen along the way and put names to faces already familiar to us. There was the Spanish merchant seaman, the sole survivor of a shipwreck, who had vowed to the Virgin that he would walk forever for Her if he survived. This was his second Camino; he had been to Rome twice and was setting out for Jerusalem next year. There was a Flemish couple who wanted to give thanks for 30 years of marriage, and ask for 30 more. There were also a surprising number of Brazilians whose pilgrimage was their first time abroad. But the largest number were the Germans, who would sleep till three or four in the morning and then head off, finishing their day's walking before lunch so that they could claim the best beds in the refugios . The dramatic scenery is seeded with stories of daring deeds: El Cid fought here, Charlemagne there - every village had its story. Being a pilgrim is good, but being a knight is better. Santiago knew this and chose to be both. He either appears as the humble pilgrim with staff, scrip and scallop shell, or as the matamoros - the killer of Moors, upon a white charger hacking a swathe through the infidel ranks. We carried on through Burgos, Fromista, Sahagun and up into the mountains beyond Leon. This was the Camino at its best. Wrapped in fleeces and thermals, we climbed through Alpine meadows, past abandoned villages and into another century. We saw pallozas - circular huts of dry-stone wall and thatch that haven't changed design since Neolithic times. We cantered along cart-tracks deep in the gloom of ancient oak forests and swam beneath waterfalls in the gorges, on our way to the monastery at Samos. We went to early morning mass and wandered around the monastery that was wrapped in fog and darkness. The end was sudden. We awoke one morning in a forest campsite, collected water from a nearby well, saddled the horses, and by noon we were in Santiago: the most beautiful cathedral I have ever seen; the pilgrims' mass; familiar faces from the trail; the huge incense burner, the botafumeiro , arcing comet-like over our heads. That evening, our horses in stables, we went out to dinner with our fellow pilgrims and ate like kings. The next, day I went back to the cathedral by myself and climbed down into the crypt, a simple stone chamber that supported all that was above it, in terms of both structure and faith. The whole Camino, every church, village and signpost pointed to this, at the bottom of some small worn steps. All my effort had been to get here, this exact spot. It was everything I had expected. When to go The coolest and quietest time to travel on the Camino is April to June or mid-September to November, though it can be very rainy. Many coincide their pilgrimage to arrive in Santiago before July 25, when the city starts celebrating the feast of St James, but the trail gets crowded and the heat is extreme. In winter the mountains become impassable.

Exactly four weeks with about five days off when one or both of the horses had sprains etc. The meticulous schedule we drew up was binned after the first few days. Even regular walkers or riders find the terrain and climate daunting. Don't underestimate the Camino. Pilgrims passport You must have a Credential del peregrino if you want to stay in the refugios . You can get them at the start of your journey from the Abbey at Roncevalles. Get it stamped at monasteries and churches, along the way, and it will help you obtain your certificate of pilgrimage at the cathedral. Accommodation We camped every night to be near the horses but there are plenty of cheap refugios and hostels along the way. Expect \u00a35 a night or free in exchange for some washing-up duties. Total cost The main expensive was the horses, about \u00a3800. The flights and the hotel set us back another \u00a3400. Food, horse medicine, and blacksmithing took the total up to \u00a31,500 each.
