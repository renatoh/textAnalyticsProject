Everyone\u2019s favourite psychosexual assassin, Villanelle, returns for another season of thrilling spy drama. Well, providing she survives the stabbing she received at the hands of MI5 agent Eve Polastri at the end of the last series. Even without Phoebe Waller-Bridge behind the wheel this season, this remains one of the most entertaining things on TV. Saturday 8 June, 9.15pm, BBC One Year of the Rabbit The tremulous baritone of Matt Berry is put to fine use in this Victorian crime caper, which stars Berry as booze-riddled, hard-nosed Detective Inspector Eli Rabbit. If that alone isn\u2019t reason enough to tune in, the guest stars include Sally Phillips, Keeley Hawes and Taika Waititi. Monday 10 June, 10pm, Channel 4 The Handmaid\u2019s Tale Just in time for summer, one of TV\u2019s bleakest shows returns for its third season. For all its faults in season two \u2013 excessive nastiness, frustrating plotting \u2013 this Elisabeth Moss-starring dystopian drama remains a bracing, timely watch at its best, and this week\u2019s opener offers up a game-changing development that should tee up the rest of its run rather nicely. Sunday 9 June, 9pm, Channel 4 The Two Princes Another week, another scripted podcast, but this one separates itself from the pack with an intriguing premise \u2013 an LGBTQ fairytale about two princes who develop feelings for each other while trying to save their respective kingdoms from a deadly threat \u2013 and voice work from the mighty Christine Baranski. Podcast Jessica Jones The last of Marvel\u2019s Netflix TV series to bow out (after The Punisher, Daredevil and Luke Cage) is also arguably the best. Season three finds Krysten Ritter\u2019s punch-first-question-later private dick reeling from the loss of her mother, and Trish\u2019s descent into murder. If it isn\u2019t to be revived when Disney launches its streaming service later this year, let\u2019s just hope Jessica Jones goes out with a bang. From Friday 14 June, Netflix Ellie &amp; Natasia Fresh from her joyously vampy turn in What We Do in the Shadows, Natasia Demetriou reunites with Year Friends pal Ellie White for this inventive, silly sketch show, featuring mummy bloggers, eastern European nail technicians and one sketch so sinister it puts David Lynch to shame. From Monday 10 June, BBC Three Too Old to Die Young Nicolas Winding Refn co-writes and directs this appropriately bruising descent into the demi-monde of LA. Miles Teller is a cop who, following the death of his partner, becomes embroiled with criminal demons \u2013 both figurative and literal. As brutal and nihilistic as you might expect. From Friday 14 June, Amazon Prime Video Gloria Paulina Garc\u00eda\u2019s Gloria is a vivacious divorcee, out to have a good time clubbing and possibly meet a new love \u2013 in the form of fun-loving Rodolfo (Sergio Hern\u00e1ndez). Trouble is, life is complicated for mature Santiago singletons; family matters and past lives intrude on both sides, lending a poignant tone to Sebasti\u00e1n Lelio\u2019s sexy, sophisticated Chilean drama. Sunday 9 June, 1.55am, Channel 4 Wild Bill Yes, that is Rob Lowe above doing his best bobby on the beat impression. This ITV drama sees the former Brat Packer and West Wing star play a flash, stats-obsessed US cop who somehow becomes chief constable of East Lincolnshire. Tonally, it\u2019s an odd fish, broad and goofy in places and bleak in others \u2013 but Lowe at least seems to be having a lot of fun. Wednesday 12 June, 9pm, ITV Big Little Lies Because HBO\u2019s delicious murder mystery wasn\u2019t stuffed with enough A-listers already, Meryl Streep has been added to the cast for its long-awaited second season. She plays the mum of much-loathed scumbag Perry, seeking answers about his sudden demise. Prestige soapiness, which real superfans can catch at the same time as US viewers (Sunday, 2am). Sunday 9, 2am; repeated Monday 10 June, 9pm, Sky Atlantic"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
