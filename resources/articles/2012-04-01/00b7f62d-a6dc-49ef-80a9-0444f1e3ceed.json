He is remembered in flashback, like a lower-rent Charlie Kane. Three former colleagues are approached by Walter Pidgeon's world-weary studio boss, begging them to work with Shields again: director Fred Amiel (Barry Sullivan), screenwriter James Lee Bartlow (Dick Powell) and star Georgia Lorrison (Lana Turner). Each icily refuses, and we see why: three intimate personal betrayals, of increasing horror, which nonetheless furthered the victims' careers in the long run. Shields's relationship with Georgia is fascinatingly ambiguous: Georgia's actor father once gave young Shields a deflowering introduction to manhood and the business. Now, by building up Georgia, he seeks \u2013 revenge? Redemption? Hollywood here looks diabolically seductive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
