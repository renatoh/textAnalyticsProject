In terms of Parisian design and lifestyle, you'll find it all here. Ever-changing pop-ups freshen the scene, such as the Parisian parfumier Diptyque offering edible-smelling scents for your body and home. This season it's all about neo retro 1950s and 60s, with a Vespa/Formica ambience and Fran\u00e7oise Hardy music. \u2022 40 boulevard Haussmann, 9th, +33 1 4282 3456, galerieslafayette.com. M\u00e9tro: Chauss\u00e9e d'Antin La Fayette. Open Mon-Wed, Fri, Sat 9.30am-7.30pm, Thu 9.30am-9pm Miss Bibi Set in the elegant shopping arcades of the Palais Royal, this compact and bijou store is full of, well, compact and bijou jewellery inspired by owner Brigitte Giraudi's memories of childhood, picnics and travels. There are beautiful items of jewellery sporting miniature treasures in gold and silver plating \u2013 tiny Louis-style chairs, pastel-coloured stilettos and old men's boots are set into rings and necklaces like items from a doll's house; baguette brooches and gingerbread-men earrings make your mouth water. Even men have options, with old pipe collar pins, sheriff cufflinks or cigarette bracelets with red diamante ends for the brave. These playful and poetic silhouettes are made with love, poetry and through-the-looking-glass magic. Prices start at around \u20ac45 for a pair of UFO earrings. \u2022 145 jardins du Palais Royal, 1st, +33 1 4260 1704, missbibi.com. M\u00e9tro: Palais Royal-Mus\u00e9e du Louvre. Open Tues-Sat 1-7pm Bonton Even if you're not into kids or retail concepts, you can't help but ooh at the stripy maillots, gingham playsuits and cutesy floral bikinis. In fact the inner child in all of us will get a kick out of the kiddie photo booth, the high-chair hair salon and the fun and affordable cartoon strip bandages, spy glasses, vintage cars and Eloise in Paris cartoon books. The mini things hung on mini washing lines and bursting out of multi-coloured suitcases on sweeping staircases over three floors will provide enough visually pleasing fun for even the smallest of retail shoppers. \u2022 5 boulevard des Filles du Calvaire, 3rd, + 33 1 4272 3469, bonton.fr. M\u00e9tro: Filles du Calvaire. Open Mon-Sat 10am-7pm. March\u00e9 R\u00e9tro d'Oberkampf The French collective running this new monthly market are definitely Parisian hipsters but they are also charming vintage enthusiasts, as opposed to being too cool for school. The vintage scene in Paris has always been a little behind London but they're catching up fast in their growing appreciation for the retro things in life, so grab the bargains at this monthly market while you can. Among the 30 or so vendeurs you'll find yourself a 1950s vinyl of Django Reinhardt for \u20ac15, a 70s peasant dress for \u20ac45 or a silk Cacharel shirt for \u20ac65. Curiosities, retro homeware, vintage tattooing and retro hair might also be on your shopping list. \u2022 Aimloft 2 Cit\u00e9 Griset, 11th, +33 6 1793 0364. M\u00e9tro: M\u00e9nilmontant, rue Saint-Maur. Open 30 Apr-1 May, 10am-5pm (and monthly dates tbc) Yaya-Store Yaya-Store is the shop of easy living, soft herbal scents and laid back attitude ... With the sounds of Cat Stevens, Elvis and Bob Dylan, and a folksy vibe, it's hard to believe it's right in the centre of Paris. The ethically-made collections are the epitome of a sort of freshly laundered but simple old-school elegance. The shop smells like lemongrass, fresh pine and lavender, and so does its owner. With one or two of her four children and her dog often in the shop, Valerie exudes earth mother beauty and good vibes. If you love a folksy, vintage, gypsy look with soft linens, laces, crochets and soft cottons, you'll be in absolute heaven. \u2022 55 rue Montmartre, 2nd, +33 1 4039 9289, yayastore.fr. M\u00e9tro: Sentier. Open Mon-Sat 11am-7.30pm Bellota-Bellota Tapas bar and delicatessen which is all about ready-to-eat, quality ingredients from France and Spain. The crushed tomato dip at this predominantly Iberian deli is indescribably delicious. If deluxe fast food for a cheeky Eurostar or plane picnic seems like a good idea then purchase a Poujauran bread from the boulangerie next door and dip into a jar of this creamy-looking tomato stuff for a bargain \u20ac4, add a slice of manchego, et voil\u00e0. Apparently the flavour is all about the pure, virgin, arbequina oil. The black truffle tarama and the jambon pata negra are also well worth putting in the takeaway bag. A good cheat for your weekend dinner invitations. \u2022 18 rue Jean Nicot, 7th, +33 1 5359 9696, bellota-bellota.com. M\u00e9tro: Latour Maubourg. Open Tues-Sat noon-3pm, 7-11pm Merci This concept design store in aid of charity offers style, substance and something to eat all in one virtuous location, with various fashion and home style concessions by ethical designers. If shopping holds limited appeal then this could be ideal for you since there are a couple of options to shop while you eat. The Used Book Caf\u00e9 is brocante-sofa clad and full of shabby chic, with 150,000 wall-to-wall books in French or English, and is a great pause point in your shopping day. Order a good coffee and a hefty smoked salmon bagel while pondering a purchase . Alternatively, the cinematography-designed Cine Cafe has all the ambience of the French silver screen, with projected films on the wall. You can decide which 1950s French arthouse classic to purchase between mouthfuls of mouelleux fondant chocolate cake. \u2022 111 boulevard Beaumarchais, 3rd, +33 1 4277 0033, merci-merci.com. M\u00e9tro: Saint-S\u00e9bastien-Froissart. Open Mon-Sat 10am-7pm Le Coiffeur de Pleine Lune Since 1985 avant-garde super-coiffeur Maachi Djelani has kept his salon open all night when there's a full moon, working on the apparently ancient theory that during a full moon the hair follicles are stimulated, meaning better and stronger hair growth, post-cut. A strange shopping experience, but a good one for those who prefer to save their pennies and crowd hassle for some post-dinner pampering. You might want to come with a flask and book in advance though, due to the Algerian hairdresser's popularity with Parisians. On those full-moon nights he's often forced to stay open until 4 or 5am. \u2022 40 rue Coquilli\u00e8re, 1st, + 33 1 4233 5747. M\u00e9tro: Les Halles. Open 10am-8pm daily, all night during full moon French Trotters Two French taste-makers and globetrotters, hence the name, Clare et Clarent offer a heritage brand fix for men, women and now kids in three stores where nigh on everything is made lovingly in France. A stripy Breton T-shirt and a perfectly good leather satchel are the type of things you'll find here. Admittedly you can find these types of classics everywhere and pretty cheaply but even if it costs a little more here, you can be sure that the workmanship and the passion in the making comes first. \u2022 (Boutique Homme) 116 rue Vieille du Temple, 3rd, +33 1 4461 0014. M\u00e9tro: Filles du Calvaire, Saint-S\u00e9bastien-Froissart. Open Mon 2.30pm-7.30pm, Tue-Sat 11.30-8pm, Sun 2pm-7pm. (Boutique Femme/Homme) 30 rue de Charonne, 11th, +33 1 4700 8435. M\u00e9tro: Ledru-Rollin. Open Mon 2.30pm-7.30pm, Tue-Sat, 11.30pm-7.30pm. frenchtrotters.fr March\u00e9 St-Pierre The haberdashery department of March\u00e9 St Pierre in Montmartre is a 60-year-old institution and home to blousey but chic French ladies with spectacles on chains and wielding lethal-looking scissors to slice through silks, wools, cottons and chiffons. Ticket in hand you are then obliged to slope off to an old-fashioned cash cubicle with a dusty till. There you must humbly queue to seek for a member of staff to stamp your receipt and take your euros, allowing you to trundle back to claim your fabrics. Peeling wallpaper, linoleum floors, a faint smell of bleach, glue and wool, it's a joy to behold. Fabric-wise you'll find your heart's desire \u2013 fuschia leopard print, Bardo-esque gingham, Liberty prints from the 70s archives \u2013 all by the metre at prices a tad cheaper than the Designers Guild. A word of advice: good manners and at least pidgin French will get you everywhere with the staff. Those scissors are sharp \u2026 \u2022 2 rue Charles Nodier, +33 1 4606 9225, marchesaintpierre.com.
