Or too much.\" Flamboyance informed the spikes of moustache that poked at his cheekbones, the sickly detail of his paintings, and the countless ugly drawings of masturbation alike. Innately theatrical, he is the perfect subject for Els Joglars, a mime-based Catalan company that shares Dali's enthusiasm for provocative comedy and the limits of realism. Not to mention his spirit of excess. This two-hour show, like Dali's oeuvre, would seriously benefit from being sliced in half. Daaali opens with its hero lying on a crumpled piano, about to die. It's a useful but contrived structural device that results in too many scenes of the artist groaning at the nurse, or shuffling about in a white shift that makes him look like a drawing of Jesus attacked by a child with a marker pen. His impending demise inevitably induces delirium, a tumble of vignettes that director and co-designer Albert Boadella relays with thrilling theatricality but not much clarity. The first world war as a Punch and Judy show is wonderful; the scene in which Hitler mistakes Beethoven for Wagner just impenetrable. It doesn't help that none of the German is translated - the Barbican's attitude towards surtitling is shockingly cavalier throughout. The play is a rush of facts: Dali's \"critical-paranoiac\" theory of painting, his brush with fascism, his rows with \"Breton-ton-ton\" are all mentioned but quickly abandoned. It skims over Dali's relationships with his wife Gala and Lorca, but too rarely settles. Gala calls Dali her little pig and emits symphonic farts, jokes that don't improve with the third repetition. Where Els Joglars excels and communicates best is in its playground depiction of Dali's contemporaries. Picasso is a wizened little puppet, babied by his entourage. Pollock, Tapies, Mondrian and Kandinsky all appear dressed as clowns for a masterclass. Dali paints Gala's creamy back on a huge electronic screen; the other four bicker and scribble, and are loftily dismissed by Dali for turning art \"into some institutionalised handicraft\". The high point is Miro as a little girl, blonde hair in pigtails, blithely telling Dali that his own paintings are full of \"doggy poop\". Such mischievous iconoclasm captures perfectly Dali's arrogance and spirit, but Els Joglars too soon allows its compact, rich expressiveness to dissipate, just as Dali did in his own career. \u0095 Until Sunday.
