This is terrifically bad news for cows, but a relief for anyone who finds cutlery arduous. Wahlburgers is actor Mark \u201cMarky Mark\u201d Wahlberg\u2019s fast-food emporium, which opened its first UK branch late last month in a perfect London location (with, apparently, plans to open many more sites over the next few years). Simply exit Covent Garden tube, head on to the cobbled thoroughfare \u2013 one of the capital\u2019s most congested tourist hotspots \u2013 and there\u2019s Wahlburgers, like an open honey jar to curious, famished ants. I say Wahlburgers is fast food, but the moment one sets foot inside, passing a merchandise stand on the way, there\u2019s a sense this might take time. Shake Shack, another relatively recent US fancy burger import, has greeters who ebulliently welcome diners to join the queue, but at Wahlburgers you\u2019re shown to a table and assigned a waitress with a sense of formality unbefitting a lurid green, unlovingly furnished, part-burger joint, part-sports bar. Assuming the sport in question is \u201cStalking the Wahlberg family\u201d: screens on every wall play highlights of 10 seasons of Wahlburgers, a reality TV show that follows the high jinks of Mark, Donnie and Paul Wahlberg\u2019s empire. Napkin holders are covered in cute family photos of dinners with Mom, the walls are emblazoned with Mark and Donnie\u2019s movie posters, and the menu is dusted with homespun tributes to Alma\u2019s macaroni \u201cmade from scratch\u201d, Jenn\u2019s chicken salad and Mom\u2019s favourite mayo. The Wahlbergs clearly love each other, and this fact seeps from every surface in an unabashed, touchy-feely, American way that sits curiously with us in Blighty, where it\u2019s only really necessary to emote at family members if someone gets cancer, though even then a firm, stoic handshake should suffice. Still, my first read-though of the Wahlburgers menu made me very, very excited, because it is a laminated bombardment of calorie-drenched potential deliciousness. The \u201cFiesta Burger\u201d with fresh jalape\u00f1os, the \u201cImpossible\u201d veggie burger with chilli-spiced tomatoes, hot sloppy joe sandwiches, house-made chilli with chipotle peppers, cobb salad, tater tots, Thanksgiving turkey burgers with stuffing, items encrusted in panko breadcrumbs and boozy milkshakes with frosted icing. Loosen those waistbands! Schedule tomorrow for living meagrely on rice cakes! For now, my friends, we dine. Hang on, the cheapest burger is \u00a39.50, rising quickly to \u00a311-\u00a314 for something a little grander. And a side of smoked bacon mac\u2019n\u2019cheese is \u00a38 how? Staring into the busy open kitchen at the back of the lower floor, you see a team of busy, uniformed workers, much like in any McDonald\u2019s. No one could doubt their focus. So what begins to head in the direction of our table is puzzling. First a cardboard carton half filled with burned sweet potato fries, then a bowl of what appears to be undressed, cheap penne that, on closer inspection, are sitting in a puddle of thin cheese soup. A single black plastic fork stands upright in the middle of it. \u201cCan we have another fork?\u201d I ask, and it instantly feels like one of those impossibly difficult requests. Service is worse than untrained; it\u2019s that sort of trained where they\u2019ve been drilled in answering seven questions only, and anything off-script or requiring empathy or gumption is best avoided. Kate orders the basic \u201cOur Burger\u201d \u2013 made with a third of a pound of mixed cuts of Scottish beef, lettuce, tomato, onion, American cheese, pickle and Paul\u2019s signature sauce (best not ask). The sauce, I think, is the best part. My Impossible burger is delicious with caramelised onions and sweet tomatoes masking a fake meat patty to the point that it could actually be beef. Kate leaves half her genuine moo option: \u201cIt\u2019s OK, but it\u2019s just not the standard of patty you\u2019d expect for this price.\u201d Here, let\u2019s order a Birthday Cake frapp\u00e9! \u201cVanilla ice-cream, vanilla vodka, cr\u00e8me de cocoa, vanilla frosting, whipped cream, rainbow sprinkles.\u201d In my mind\u2019s eye, this will be like your birthday knickerbocker glory at Wimpy in 1981: enormous, multi-layered, gooey, fluffy and joyful. It arrives, and it\u2019s a long, straight pint glass filled with what looks like vanilla Complan with a few hundreds and thousands on the rim of the glass. It\u2019s thicker than porridge and will not suck up the straw. \u201cAre you enjoying it?\u201d the waitress asks. \u201cNo, it\u2019s literally inedible,\u201d I reply. \u201cCan we maybe have a spoon?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d she says. I have been in the deepest of umbrages with Wahlburgers since my visit. Apparently Mark rises at 2.30am every morning. In that case, good, I\u2019m making progress: he\u2019s definitely feeling those voodoo pins. \u2022 Wahlburgers 8-9 James Street, London WC2, 020-3968 4446. Open all week, 11am-11pm (10.30pm Sun).
