Sam Bourne is a pseudonym for one of the Guardian's senior columnists, Jonathan Freedland. The review when it arrived was what is commonly called a stinker, so much so, in fact, that the reviewer thought it necessary to attach a note which read, in part: \"It's pretty harsh, I'm afraid. If this is a problem for you or anyone else at the paper I'll settle for a modest kill fee, but it really is the most awful tosh.\" The literary editor was sufficiently exercised by this health warning to take the fairly unusual step of discussing it with the editor of the Guardian. She pointed out to him the option that the reviewer had thoughtfully suggested, of accepting a kill fee. A kill fee is a sum, usually less than the full fee agreed for a published article, payable in certain circumstances to the writer of a commissioned piece that is written but rejected. The editor of the paper discussed the issue with several senior members of his staff, including Jonathan Freedland. He decided, after these discussions, that the literary editor should pay the reviewer the kill fee. What Michael Dibdin received, in fact, was the full fee that he would have been paid had publication of the review in the Guardian gone ahead. A version of this sequence of events appeared in the satirical magazine Private Eye. Dibdin, a regular reviewer in the Guardian, reacted quickly to this with an email to the literary editor: \"Dear C, The latest issue of Private Eye has just arrived here ... and I was shocked to discover a para about my Sam Bourne review on the 'Street of Shame' page. Please be assured that I was not the source for this, any more than I was for the Times Diary piece.\" He added: \"I completely understand why you decided against publishing, and indeed had said in my original submission letter ... that I would be happy to accept a kill fee if it proved awkward for you. I've enjoyed reviewing for the Guardian and have no wish to become persona non grata there, particularly over such a trivial matter as this.\" Private Eye had reported that an editorial edict had forbidden Dibdin to darken the doorstep again. Dibdin in another email to the literary editor asked, \"Is it true?\" She wrote to him reassuringly, \"I'd definitely like you to do Niccol\u00f2 Ammaniti and have put you down for it.\" She emailed the editor and Jonathan Freedland making clear her intention to continue to commission reviews from Dibdin. The Times Diary item, mentioned by Dibdin, above, had indicated the customary pleasure that one paper enjoys in the difficulties of another. More to the point it had coincided with the publication in the Times of the Dibdin review that Dibdin had offered to the paper after its rejection by the Guardian. Whether or not Dibdin broke some \"gentleman's agreement\" or tacit understanding implied in a kill fee that the piece should not be offered elsewhere, seems to me to be not an important point. I do not think the payment of a kill fee implies any such embargo, unless some special provision has been agreed. The editor of the Guardian says that had Dibdin not volunteered to withdraw the review and accept a kill fee, the paper would have published it. Jonathan Freedland also believes that Dibdin's offer was the key factor. He added, \"It would probably have been wise to ignore his offer and publish it ...\" That now appears to be the view of everyone involved, and it is certainly mine. Michael Dibdin does not see it as a crisis. \"I want to say there is no animus in this. I admire Freedland as a journalist and I like his columns. I'd also like to say that I did not offer the rejected review to the Times in anger. I was not angry then and I am not angry now. I spent a lot of time on the review and I just wanted to see it published.\" Freedland says, \"Anyway, the book is out there now and has received at least a couple of good reviews to balance his.\" The literary editor is embarked upon a timely review of her own, looking at the way in which the Guardian reviews Guardian authors and its reviewing policies in general. We can come to that on another occasion. \u00b7 Ian Mayes is the president of the Organisation of News Ombudsmen www.newsombudsmen.org"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
