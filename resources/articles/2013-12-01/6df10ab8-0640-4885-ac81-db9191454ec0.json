Lloyds said it would reintroduce a slimmed-down range of packaged accounts in the new year. A spokeswoman said it wanted to move to a \"single, consistent sales process, and align ourselves with the rest of the group and the industry\". Confirmation that Lloyds and Bank of Scotland are planning to reintroduce their Silver and Platinum packaged accounts, which cost \u00a39.95 and \u00a317 a month respectively, comes days after Lloyds Banking Group was hit with a record \u00a328m fine for putting staff under intense pressure to sell products or face demotion and pay cuts. This followed a Financial Conduct Authority investigation into its sales of investment products such as share-based Isas and critical illness and income protection insurance. Until recently Lloyds was offering four packaged accounts, including one that cost \u00a325 a month, but the Gold and Premier accounts are no longer being marketed to new customers. In December 2012 Lloyds TSB temporarily stopped branch and phone-based sales of the accounts, which have continued to be available online. In March this year the FCA's predecessor, the Financial Services Authority, tightened the rules on the selling of packaged accounts, amid speculation that it feared some banks and building societies may have been mis-selling them. Among the concerns were that many people would be better off buying the benefits individually, or not at all, and that some customers were struggling to make successful claims on the insurance that is often included as a perk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
