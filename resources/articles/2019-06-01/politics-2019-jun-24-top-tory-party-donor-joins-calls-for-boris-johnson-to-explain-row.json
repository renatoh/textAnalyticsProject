John Griffin, the taxi tycoon who has given \u00a34m to the Tories over the last six years, has expressed concerns about the morality of the favourite to become prime minister and called on him to explain the circumstances of a furious row with his partner, Carrie Symonds. His comments follow demands from Johnson\u2019s leadership rival, Jeremy Hunt, fellow cabinet ministers and Tory backbenchers for the former London mayor to answer questions about his past behaviour amid growing concerns about his character. Asked about Johnson\u2019s responsibilities before the Conservative party chooses a new leader next month, Griffin, the Tories\u2019 second biggest donor, told the Guardian he should explain exactly what had happened. \u201cWe deserve an explanation about that row, and he has to handle it properly. He can\u2019t assume that we are going to support him when he has not explained every detail,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is likely that he is going to become the PM and most members want to support him. But if I did anything wrong, I would need to explain. Because he hasn\u2019t, it is a real worry.\u201d The story emerged after a neighbour told the Guardian he had been so concerned by a late-night altercation between Johnson and Symonds that he had felt obliged to call the police. Other neighbours confirmed the argument had taken place and said they had been concerned by its intensity. Griffin, a Brexiter and founder of the cab firm Addison Lee, expressed concerns about Johnson\u2019s morality and said he should also come clean about his previous behaviour, including his responsibilities to his children. Johnson has four children by his former wife, Marina Wheeler, and a child with a woman with whom he had an affair. However, he has been dogged by unproven claims that he has at least one more child. Johnson has refused to comment. Griffin, who stood down as chairman of Addison Lee in 2014, said: \u201cEach of his children need his love and attention. But he needs to show that he has given it to them. He cannot say that it is irrelevant. It is highly relevant. It is one of the ways you measure a person. \u201cHe may very well be the best father ever, but he needs to tell us about it. It is a fair question,\u201d he said. Griffin also called for Johnson to address allegations that he had had extramarital affairs and had treated women in those relationships badly. \u201cWe need to know if he can be trusted because he will get even more attention from women if he becomes PM. I would be concerned if he went marauding around, taking advantage of women by using his position. It would not be right at all,\u201d he said. Griffin is the second major Conservative donor to demand that Johnson explain what happened on Friday in Camberwell, south London. Another, who has given the party more than \u00a3500,000, told the Guardian the issue around the row was damaging the party. \u201cWe are a laughing stock,\u201d he said. Griffin\u2019s intervention comes as the party becomes increasingly dependent upon major donors. The former mayor of London, who is widely expected to win the leadership race, is due to take part in a digital hustings with Tory party members on Monday. Earlier on Monday, Hunt sidestepped questions about whether Johnson was a fit person to be prime minister, but emphasised that the runaway favourite among the party\u2019s members needed to earn the trust of voters. \u201cThe way to earn that trust with Conservative party members and with the country is to subject yourself to scrutiny to answer questions about what you actually want to do,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He said it was \u201cincredibly disrespectful\u201d of Johnson to refuse to take part in any head-to-head television debates until after ballot papers had gone out to party members, and warned that a Johnson-led government would rapidly collapse."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
