Sixth formers have lost the chance to improve their grades through last-minute revision, and university students have been left hanging, unable to sit their final exams, say goodbye to friends, or invite their families to graduation ceremonies. Students from different stages in their education tell how their plans for the future are being shaped by the crisis. Sukhdip Nagra A-level student, Leicester High School for Girls \u201cEveryone was scared on the last few days of sixth form, with lots of people self-isolating. We were told on Wednesday that we had two days to say goodbye; it felt rushed. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next or when we\u2019ll see each other. I was going to put everything into my revision around Easter. In January when you\u2019ve got mocks your priority isn\u2019t revision, and then there\u2019s other deadlines to meet \u2013 coursework, personal statements, Ucas applications. Teacher attainment grades don\u2019t take that into consideration. Now I\u2019ve lost the motivation to continue revising as I have lost sight of what I will be working towards. The conflicting information from teachers, who are also uncertain, has left us students confused. I fear that all schools will not be held to the same regulations, with some recommending students do essays as evidence of their grade. This system could disadvantage students with a poor relationship with their teacher and BAME students, who tend to exceed their predicted grades. I would prefer exams to be postponed. Because there have been a lot of articles about the cap on university places, everyone was worried about theirs being taken away. My application didn\u2019t need to be firmed until 4 May, but I didn\u2019t want my place getting taken away so I firmed out of fear. Although I do think I made the right decision, I feel I should have taken more time to make it.\u201d Andrew Gallagher First-year journalism student, Ulster University \u201cBecause of the staff strikes and now the coronavirus outbreak, I\u2019ve only had four physical classes in my first year. The rest have been online. It feels like we\u2019re being left high and dry with very little support. We\u2019ve had very few contact hours. Ideally I\u2019d like a reduced fee next year, or a bit of money back. However we have technically still been \u2018taught\u2019 throughout the outbreak. And obviously with the strikes, reducing our fees is only going to reduce money available to the staff who were on strike for better pay, so that doesn\u2019t really sound fair. The online teaching has been OK. But I haven\u2019t had video classes, which most of the other courses do \u2013 they\u2019ve just put up PowerPoints and lecture notes for us that we\u2019ve had to read through. So you have less of the explanation, and it\u2019s a lot more effort if you\u2019re having issues with something. You\u2019ve got to email your lecturer and then wait for a response, whereas in an actual lecture you\u2019d have a response instantly. We were also learning to use Adobe software, but the university won\u2019t shell out for all of us to download it, so that\u2019s a few months of useful learning down the drain.\u201d Callum Sheridan-Lee Acting student, Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts \u201cWe\u2019re in a limbo. We were in the middle of our final shows, halfway through rehearsals, then everything got cancelled. The school\u2019s doing its best to keep the teaching online, but with acting it\u2019s difficult to practise your craft without being in a room with other actors and the director. At the moment our shows are postponed indefinitely and we\u2019re just waiting for information. Either they\u2019ll postpone and we\u2019ll go back into rehearsals later, or they\u2019ll cancel them and replace it with some kind of written assessment, which would be a shame. It would be a difficult time anyway, that first year out of university. Our third year was meant to be about getting us out into the industry: getting agents and meetings with casting directors. It\u2019s about launching the first year of your acting career. But nothing\u2019s happening in the industry \u2013 shows have been cancelled, and casting directors aren\u2019t meeting with people. The casting directors don\u2019t have any work either. Some of them are doing callouts for show reels online to support acting grads. In your third year, you\u2019re also saying goodbye to a lot of people you might never see again. My flatmate is from Iceland, and he suddenly had to go home. There\u2019s this sense of \u2018is that it? Is that the last time I see you for the next few years?\u2019 It\u2019s a weird time.\u201d Caitlin Cassel Final-year philosophy student, University of Reading \u201cI\u2019m a bit fed up. I\u2019ve spent three years working hard to maintain a good grade and now, with the anxiety of everything going on, it\u2019s hard to get anything done. I have a chronic disability, which means I struggle with going to lectures and other things. It\u2019s funny how they\u2019ve now put lectures online, which they wouldn\u2019t normally do for disabled students like me. But they can suddenly do it now everyone\u2019s impacted. My graduation has been postponed. A lot of people might not be able to attend theirs now. It feels like we\u2019ve worked so hard for this big moment, and it\u2019s been taken away. Obviously you can\u2019t predict a global pandemic, but it\u2019s tough. The university has offered deadline extensions and exam retakes, but it doesn\u2019t really work for final-year students. A lot of us will be starting jobs, internships or master\u2019s programmes. We\u2019ve asked for a \u2018no detriment\u2019 policy because we have no access to materials in the library. This would mean any work we hand in now doesn\u2019t negatively affect our overall grades if it\u2019s below standard. But the university said no. I\u2019ve still got 45% of my final-year assessments to submit. It\u2019s very tough.\u201d Alice O\u2019Driscoll Final year PhD student, University of Cambridge \u201cThe archives and libraries that I depend on were understandably shut with very little notice so I grabbed what books I could. I don\u2019t have all the resources I need to keep working so I\u2019m tinkering at the edges of my thesis. So many of the \u2018lightbulb\u2019 moments that have occurred over my studies have been instigated by conversations with other students or fellows with completely different research interests. I\u2019m feeling very anxious. These are not conducive circumstances for work at the moment, with the amount of worry I\u2019m feeling for my family. I got engaged on 16 March, a few hours before Boris Johnson\u2019s press conference discouraging non-essential contact. We haven\u2019t been able to see any of our friends to celebrate. But we\u2019re thrilled, and wedding planning has given us something other than work to think about while we\u2019re cooped up in our college accommodation. Like a lot of postgraduate students I do part-time work to supplement my income. I had a zero-hours contract, the flexibility of which really suited me, but now that\u2019s dried up I\u2019m \u00a350 per week worse off. I have friends working on historical epidemics and plagues who are tweaking their research grant applications to highlight the sudden, painful relevance of their topics. I study sieges in seventeenth-century Britain and Ireland. Accounts which emphasise the claustrophobic intimacy of besiegement and the fear of diseases which swept through enclosed spaces, strike me a lot more now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
