It's immensely interesting because weather conditions are included in each entry. The diarist was aged about 20. One of the first reports is from the river Don in Aberdeenshire in late April, 1933, when it was \"very thundery with a perfect deluge at the end\". One year later in the same area he caught two trout despite \"strong, north-east wind and violent snow blizzard most of the time\". One of this young angler's favourite haunts was the Barlow Brook where it flowed through his aunt's farm. Right through the 1930s he regularly caught good quantities of trout where, I'm sure, one would struggle to catch anything worth taking home for tea these days. Whereas he had fished on 54 days in 1938, catching 251 trout and 10 grayling, by 1943 he only managed five days and 28 trout. By now he was serving in the RAF and the last entry was 26 July, in the Hope Valley. Soon afterwards he failed to return from a bombing mission. His fishing diary has lain unopened for almost 70 years, the entries as bold and clear as the day each was carefully entered. That stretch of water flowing through his late aunt's estate is no longer fished. It still runs beneath the single arch of a stone roadbridge built by a local mason who won the contract from the county council in 1896 with a tender of \u00a35. The banks are dark and overhung by Himalayan balsam, elder and low branches of beech and sycamore. The delicate footbridge that gave access to the far bank has collapsed: it is the spot where our angler caught so many of those recorded trout in the forgotten long-ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
