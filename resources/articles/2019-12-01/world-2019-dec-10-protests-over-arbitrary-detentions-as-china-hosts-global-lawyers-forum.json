On Tuesday China held the second day of the global lawyers forum, coinciding with human rights day, bringing more than 800 legal professionals including those from the International Bar Association, the International Association of Lawyers, and the Bar Council of England and Wales. China\u2019s justice minister, Fu Zhenghua, said it was \u201can opportunity for China to draw on global experience in developing the rule of law\u201d, Xinhua news agency reported. But as the forum got under way, at least one spouse of a detained lawyer was put under house arrest. Several rights groups have issued open letters decrying the event as a \u201ccynical charade\u201d intended to gloss over China\u2019s ongoing crackdown on lawyers, from well-known human rights advocates to self-taught local, or \u201cbarefoot, lawyers\u201d who help residents petition for their rights. \u201cTo this day, there are still human rights lawyers who are forcefully \u2018disappeared\u2019,\u201d the China human rights lawyer concern group wrote in an open letter on Friday. \u201cMost endured torture during incarceration; some still suffer from psychological trauma because of the untold horrors they experienced while detained or jailed,\u201d such as sleep deprivation, forced medication, and being forced to sit in a contraption known as the \u201ctiger bench\u201d. Among those detained are four lawyers who have been declared \u201carbitrarily detained\u201d by the United Nations working group on arbitrary detention, including Wang Quanzhang, who was sentenced to four and a half years in prison for subversion after a secret trial held on Boxing Day last year. Wang\u2019s defence lawyer, Yu Wensheng was also detained and tried in a closed door trial. On Monday his wife, Xu Yan, posted on Twitter that more than 10 police surrounded her apartment, preventing her from leaving. She had previously called on lawyers to ask about her husband\u2019s whereabouts. Others include Zhou Shifeng, the founder of the Beijing-based Fengrui law firm which helped expose China\u2019s 2008 milk formula scandal, and Li Yuhan, detained in 2017 after she defended another prominent human rights lawyer caught in the 709 crackdown on more than 200 lawyers and activists. Since then lawyers involved in rights cases have also been stripped of their licences. \u201cChinese judicial authorities hosting a global lawyers event while imprisoning and disbarring Chinese human rights lawyers makes a mockery of international cooperation on rule of law,\u201d said Frances Eve, the deputy director of research at the NGO Chinese Human Rights Defenders, which has been calling on the international organisations attending the event to pressure Chinese officials to release detained Chinese rights advocates. \u201cIt is being held over international human rights day, when bar associations should be standing up for the rights of lawyers, not helping the Chinese government try and whitewash its egregious human rights abuses.\u201d The Bar Council of England and Wales said in a statement before the event that it \u201crepeats its calls to the Chinese authorities to release any lawyers arrested in the legitimate pursuit of their practice, which includes the right to advocate freely and fearlessly in the best interests of their lay clients\u201d. As the forum opened on Monday, Geng He, the wife of prominent lawyer Gao Zhisheng, who disappeared more than two years ago, published an open letter to those in attendance. \u201cYou have the responsibility and obligation to ask the Chinese government that invited you: \u2018Is Gao Zhisheng alive?\u2019 \u201cOr else, why did you come? To enjoy the air tickets, the hotels and luxurious hospitality of the Chinese Communist party\u2019s dictatorship \u2026 or to let the CCP use your status and reputation to once again proclaim the greatness of CCP rule at home and abroad?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
