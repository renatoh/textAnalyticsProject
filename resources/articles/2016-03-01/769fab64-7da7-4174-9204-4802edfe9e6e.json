In the wake of Maria Sharapova\u2019s positive test for meldonium the International Tennis Federation, which runs and administers the tennis anti-doping programme, insists in-competition testing is random but with players suggesting otherwise, anti-doping experts warn that players who may be microdosing could slip through the net. Having been criticised for not testing out of competition enough, the ITF has focused its resources on that area in recent years, vastly increasing its testing numbers, with more blood tests. Out-of-competition testing is considered to be the most important area in catching cheats but it seems tennis is cutting back, relatively, on testing during competitions. Britain\u2019s Heather Watson said she has been tested after a win only once in her career. \u201cI got tested after I won once and it was awful,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go to the bathroom and I had to wait all evening and I had a match the next day. That\u2019s only happened once. I think when you\u2019re winning it\u2019s not really fair [to be tested]. But, let\u2019s say I\u2019ve been tested about 50 times, I\u2019d say 49 times were after a loss.\u201d The Swiss teenager Belinda Bencic, who recently broke into the world\u2019s top 10 for the first time, backed up Watson\u2019s comments. \u201cMy last test was in the Australian Open, after when I lost, like always,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you keep playing [in a tournament], they are not going to test you [when you win]. I think they can but it\u2019s normally when you lose and you have more time and they do the drug test.\u201d As the Lance Armstrong case in cycling showed, microdosing \u2013 the taking of a very low dose of a drug that is then flushed from the system in a matter of hours \u2013 is an increasing concern. Don Catlin, the American anti-doping expert, who founded the UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory, said the ITF should be more aware of the dangers. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad [if they\u2019re only testing after losses] but they\u2019re going to have to wake up after this [the Sharapova] event,\u201d he said. Dr Mario Thevis, a professor at the anti-doping laboratory in Cologne which helped to develop the test for meldonium, said on Friday microdosing was a huge challenge. \u201cMicrodoses represent even lower levels of prohibited substances than we are entitled to test for. I think it\u2019s an inherent problem that the lower the concentrations, the more we have to work on it to test efficiently.\u201d Responding to the players\u2019 comments, Stuart Miller, the head of the anti-doping programme, said the ITF does not discuss the finer details of its test distribution plan, for reasons of confidentiality. \u201cHowever, both random and targeted testing occurs at events, which includes winners and losers,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cAs an aside, about half of all samples collected under the TADP in 2015 were out-of-competition tests, which cuts across the winner/loser issue.\u201d The ITF says it tested 2,256 players in-competition during 2015 and 2,177 out of competition. In view of the fact there are 254 singles matches in each of the four grand slam events \u2013 a total of 1016 \u2013 that hardly seems extensive. The anti-doping budget \u2013 paid for by the ITF, ATP, WTA and the four grand slam events \u2013 is reportedly only $4m. On Thursday Andy Murray criticised his racket sponsor, Head, for announcing they would be extending Sharapova\u2019s deal despite her positive test. On Friday Head said Wada should have banned meldonium only over a certain dosage, rather than outright. Murray said the fact the Sharapova case is in the public domain offers tennis a chance to be transparent. \u201cThe positive thing is it is actually out there,\u201d Murray said in Indian Wells. \u201cIn the past a lot of times people have said that it is [just] the lesser names that have come out, even though there have actually been more big names than you would think over the years. But Maria is probably the biggest female athlete in the world, maybe the most recognisable. I think if nothing was said about it, that\u2019s when it\u2019s actually really bad for the sport even though some people may say: \u2018OK, it\u2019s good\u2019 [when there are no positive tests]. It\u2019s not.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
