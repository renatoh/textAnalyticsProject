His translator, Annie McDermott, tells us in an introduction that he was an uncategorisable cult figure formed of omnivorous influences, from comic strips to tango music. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to expect literature to come only from literary sources,\u201d he told a rare interviewer, \u201clike expecting a cheesemaker to eat nothing but cheese.\u201d Seemingly autobiographical, Empty Words (1996) is set between 1989 and 1991, taking the form of the diary of a depressed and overweight fiction writer with eczema. His mother has just had a stroke and his wife wants an expensive new house, which he\u2019s hoping to fund with a pay rise from his job, setting crossword puzzles. When a friend says handwriting exercises might help him feel better, he ditches his typewriter for a pen and sets about making his crabbed script more uniform and free-flowing, without pausing to worry what his words mean. \u201cI know these daily exercises will do wonders for my health and character... catapulting me blissfully into a life of happiness, joy, money, and success with women and in other games of chance.\u201d There\u2019s a dry humour here. In his entry for 6 October 1990, he pats himself on the back for keeping up his regime; yet the previous entry is dated 4 October. \u201cI think the antidepressants are starting to do something,\u201d he says later. \u201cI\u2019m definitely noticing the side effects, anyway.\u201d His plea for a pay rise gets him fired, by alerting his bosses that they\u2019ve been overpaying him. In 1990, Uruguay had only recently surfaced from more than a decade of military rule, a period in which torture, political imprisonment and disappearances were commonplace. It\u2019s probably no coincidence that, while Levrero\u2019s narrator craves meaning-free prose, concentrating only on each letter\u2019s strokes and loops, he still finds himself haunted by the years between 1985 and 1989, when he suddenly left the country for Argentina, for reasons kept hazy. \u201cA vague narrative relating to a war and various soldiers or policemen I had to hide from\u201d features among his recurring dreams, some comically erotic, others plain surreal. At the same time, his travails could belong to any writer, scorning interruption while secretly craving it; his teenage son, (\u201che\u2019s seen his name written down and wants to know what this is all about... so I write: Juan Ignacio is a fool\u201d), his pet dog and the noisy electricity substation next door are among various things enabling his inactivity. Despairing of \u201can environment where everything colludes to make you aim low\u201d, he resents being \u201cbound by the omnipotent will of a woman who is in turn completely bound by social conventions\u201d: his wife just wants to celebrate Christmas. McDermott tells us that, in his first novel, The City, Levrero set out \u201calmost ... to translate Kafka into Uruguayan\u201d. I half-wondered if Empty Words was his shot at Thomas Bernhard; in particular, the Austrian\u2019s 1982 novel Concrete, about another sickly procrastinator blaming all and sundry for his inability to finish a book, although Levrero \u2013 at least on this evidence \u2013 feels the sunnier writer, relishing the mundane comedy of household dynamics as much as more cosmic jokes of existence. Just as you\u2019re wondering where it\u2019s all going, a last-minute revelation concerning the narrator\u2019s mother confirms a lingering suspicion that the real action in this teasing jeu d\u2019esprit lies between the lines, not on them, as the writing itself begins to look like a form of displacement activity. As a calling card for Levrero\u2019s talent, it\u2019s certainly enticing. Next up, we\u2019re told, is The Luminous Novel, which contains \u201ca 450-page prologue explaining why it was impossible to write the book itself\u201d.
