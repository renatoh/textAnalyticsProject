The university\u2019s provision of welfare services has come under particular scrutiny after six students there killed themselves in little over a year. The changes, which will result in savings of \u00a3800,000, are part of a review aimed at improving student support. But critics say proposals to get rid of wardens and \u201csenior residents\u201d living in halls alongside the undergraduates in their care constitute \u201ca major threat to student wellbeing\u201d. The university insists live-in peer support will continue, backed up by a more professional, round-the-clock service located outside halls. The proposals have been put out for consultation and if approved are due to be introduced next September. Bristol, which is one of the most prestigious universities in the UK, has been the focus of widespread media coverage because of a cluster of unrelated student deaths that have heightened sector-wide concerns about mental health and the capacity of higher education institutions to deal with student demands for support. A university spokesman said its pastoral system was out of date and no longer fit for purpose. In an attempt to professionalise the service, the university plans to deliver support through three hubs on campus, which will be staffed around the clock, day and night, by a team of 15 full-time equivalent \u201cresidential life advisers\u201d. The roles of deputy warden and warden \u2013 usually held by academics and postgraduates who live in either free or heavily subsidised accommodation in return for their services \u2013 will be eliminated, and the number of senior residents (currently 130) who live in halls with reduced rents (usually undergraduates in their second or third year) will be reduced and renamed \u201cresidential life mentors\u201d. Rooms freed up by the changes will be rented out. The spokesman denied it was a cost-cutting exercise and said any savings would be ringfenced to subsidise student rents. He also pointed to an additional \u00a31m investment in wellbeing services in academic departments, which are intended to dovetail with the new residential pastoral services. Bristol students\u2019 union welcomed the proposals. Lucky Dube, the union\u2019s student living officer, said students liked the dual support systems both in halls and in the academic schools. He said: \u201cWe believe the proposed changes are a sensible response to feedback and research gathered from our students. We also welcome the retention of live-in peer support.\u201d But critics fear the new provision will result in a less visible and permanent pastoral presence in halls. One deputy warden, who faces losing his home, told the Guardian: \u201cThe proposed structure that they wish to implement will in real terms see students having less face-to-face contact with pastoral staff and fewer live-in pastoral staff. On the back of six student suicides since September 2016, that they would suggest that this is a good idea is frankly staggering.\u201d Senior residents have sent a letter to the university warning that the creation of hubs will result in a \u201cdepersonalisation of the system\u201d that will deter high-risk and vulnerable students from reaching out. One senior resident, who dealt with one of the recent suicides, said: \u201cThis is actually incredibly dangerous, what they are doing. They have no real evidence what they are proposing is a better system.\u201d The university spokesman said its pastoral support system was designed for a different era when there were far fewer students, less diversity in the student body, a more limited range of halls, and when the complexity of mental health and wellbeing issues was much less than now. \u2022 In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.
