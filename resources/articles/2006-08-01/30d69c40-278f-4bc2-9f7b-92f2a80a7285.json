This is why: \"The social class gap among those entering higher education is a national disgrace. Students from middle-class backgrounds were three times more likely to go to university than those from poorer backgrounds. That vicious statistic has to be reversed.\" So said former secretary of state for education Charles Clarke in January 2003. That was then; this is now. You are 18. You have slogged your guts out to be the first in your family to go to university. Next Wednesday is A level results day. You know you have done well. But that's not good enough. \u00a33,000 annual fees, to be introduced next month, create debt and a fear of debt that mean it's a gamble you just can't take. With fees totalling \u00a39,000, and average living costs of \u00a312,000, you know you can't afford to walk away owing more than \u00a320,000. University is out of reach - not of your ability, but of your pocket. You think about your better-off friends getting ready to go. They have the confidence, and the mummies and daddies, to pay off large debts. This is the summer of friends, places and ideas that will never be yours. Before the tuition fees act was passed, Professor Claire Callender, author of a study commissioned by education ministers, wrote: \"Variable fees increase both the costs of higher education for students and their debt. Both deter low-income groups' participation.\" She said the new reforms would \"reassert elitism in higher education. Privileged students who populate top universities will pay high fees, but get highly valued degrees. Low income and access students who populate universities at the bottom of the hierarchy will pay less and get less, but still end up with large debts.\" Now official figures show she was right. The percentage of students going to university from poor families has fallen. The number from all state schools has fallen too. Little wonder, when 47% of sixth formers questioned by the Universities Marketing Forum said that inability to afford fees was likely to put them off a degree. Poorer students' debt has already risen dramatically - by two and half times since 1998 - and is on average 43% higher than that of children from better-off families. A Higher Education Funding Council report said teenagers in the richest areas could expect a better than 50% chance of going to university, while in the poorest neighbourhoods it is 10%. Universities are an expanding closed shop, filled by more stupid middle-class children. Why has a Labour government made that \"vicious statistic\" worse? The answer lies in New Labour's uncritical acceptance of globalisation. The elite universities endlessly badgered the prime minister for funding freedom to compete with America's Ivy League. It is an argument for entrenched elitism that will be made worse by variable fees. I was told at the time by a minister that the government had looked at 76 varieties of funding. Variable fees were picked because they most resembled the operation of a market, allowing the \"best\" universities to attract the \"best\" students, ie those who can pay most. The successful universities could then distinguish themselves from the competition. Where price equals value, competition can drive efficiency and encourage the survival of the fittest. This is what untrammelled globalisations demands. This commercialisation of higher education serves a bigger purpose, though. It softens students up for the rigours of globalisation. By creating a market, young people are encouraged to think and behave like rational economic man. They become \"human capital\", calculating the rate of return on their university investment. A degree becomes a share certificate. Commercialisation conditions students to expect no help from others, or society, and therefore never to provide help in return. Debt and economic conditioning discourages graduates from going into lower-paid caring jobs - and instead into the City, where the real \"value\" is. It fashions a Britain that competes rather than cares. Tony Blair has said that universities are the \"coalmines of the 21st century\". This is a grim, dogmatic economism that fails to chime with the beliefs of many young people who are trying to turn away from the long-hours culture of many jobs, who aren't only interested in maximising profits, but keen to work for social enterprises and charities. They want to do good, not just make good. Variable fees haven't yet worked as well as the government hoped. With a cap of \u00a33,000, most universities have stuck at the highest level. A few have \"sold\" places at \u00a32,000 to encourage take up. But do we want universities that in effect pile them high to sell them cheap? The pressure is on to lift the fees cap, so real variability can kick in. Then the market can sort the wheat from the chaff. One former head of the funding council is predicting \u00a35,000 by 2010. Others think \u00a310,000 is more likely. The government has put a financial support package together - but it's clearly not working. Instead young people are calculating that the size of debt means it's not worth the risk. Not least when globalisation ensures that many graduate jobs are being outsourced to places like India where the better qualified work for less. If New Labour has a social philosophy it is of a meritocracy. Here the state provides the opportunity for everyone to flourish to the best of their ability. But unchecked markets mean social mobility is already declining. Variable fees will make it worse. So what to do? The social economist David Purdy has suggested a tax of 1% of income levied on all graduates when they exceed the basic rate threshold, with all proceeds earmarked to pay for higher education. Universities get the funding they need, but we insulate them from divisive market forces and ensure no one ends up in debt. Crucially we also set up an intergenerational sense of rights and responsibilities between graduates. Gordon Brown was known to be critical of variable fees. Could this be one of his reforms to signal not just a continuation of Blairism but a break too? Creating markets is not a new response. It is certainly not a Labour response, as markets create winners and losers. That's their function. Labour's function is to reduce inequality. Explaining his reforms Tony Blair told MPs that \"it is hard to think of a package more in tune with Labour values of equity, inclusion, and high quality public services open to all\". I wonder what those left behind this summer think? \u00b7 Neal Lawson is chair of the left-of-centre pressure group Compass Compassonline.org.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
