After his smooth victory under 12st in a Sandown handicap two weeks ago, the signs are promising. But Nicky Henderson's nine-year-old could have more of a fight on his hands than on this day last year when he slammed Celibate by 22 lengths in the corresponding Ascot race. The much-improved Banker Count travels strongly in his races and should find this 2m3f trip ideal. However, race conditions favour Tiutchev (2.35) and he should prevail. Ascot 1.30: French import Jimmy Tennis has form with Japhet which makes him a danger to Artic Jack , who looks a useful stayer in the making. Newcastle 1.55: Granted a clear round, easy Wetherby winner Stamparland Hill should defy his penalty. Ascot 2.00: Farmer Jack is likely to be all the rage after his creditable run behind Iris Royal at Sandown, where he appeared to have too much use made of him, and there could be value in opposing him with Ideal Du Bois Beury . Entered in the novice hurdles at the Cheltenham Festival, Martin Pipe's six-year-old has improved for a step up in trip and it is unlikely we have seen the best of him yet. Teaatral looks best of the remainder. Warwick 2.15: Winning point-to-pointer and hunter-chaser, Lakefield Rambler goes well fresh. He is capable of leading all the way. Newcastle 2.30: After three runs to qualify for a handicap mark, Gypsy is interesting. He was not knocked about from two out when third behind Man Murphy at Carlisle last time and he enjoys a big pull in the weights with Mary Reveley's gelding. Warwick 2.45: Bought cheaply out of Nicky Henderson's stable, Veridian has a race of this description in him judging by his Cheltenham effort when fourth behind Copeland. Newcastle 3.05: Highly-tried so far this season, A Piece Of Cake looks the one. He has shown useful form over this course and distance. Newcastle 3.35: Trainer Tom George has the 4m National Hunt Chase at Cheltenham in mind for Suntas and the mare catches the eye off a handy weight here. Closely related to Welsh National winner Jocks Cross, Suntas won a strongly-run novice chase at Huntingdon in good style. Warwick 3.55: Hit And Run is a game sort but the weights favour the useful five-year-old Armaturk. Newcastle 4.10: There should be better to come from Devil's Run , who ran on strongly to beat subsequent scorer Mr Cospector on his handicap debut at Wetherby."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
