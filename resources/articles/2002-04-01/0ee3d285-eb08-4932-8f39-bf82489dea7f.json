In later life, Handel frequently returned to this score to filch ideas for his later works; passages more familiar from his operas Rodelinda and Rinaldo leap from the score. It also has the odd moment of rather endearingly rash harmonic experimentation, very different from his mature style. In fact, this last \"discovery\" of the series offered more insight into Handel's development as an opera composer than as the man who would write Messiah. Opera lovers in Rome, where he was living at the time, had their sport banned by the Pope, and oratorios such as this one assumed most of the showy musical fashions of opera while still masquerading as something improving. The highlight of this performance was Sara Mingardo as Disillusion. She is a real contralto, with a lusciously velvety voice and seemingly unfailing sensitivity. Her five arias were riveting. As Beauty, the soprano Joanne Lunn was a late stand-in for Sophie Daneman; so late, apparently, that she hadn't known that morning that she would be singing in the evening, and singing a work she hadn't performed before. But she performed Beauty's role with enviable composure, a clear, bell-like tone and sensually shaped phrases. The earthier yet sparky soprano Roberta Invernizzi and the agile tenor Nicholas Sears completed the quartet. The OAE's playing was up to its usual quality; it is getting tempting to take Alison Bury's deliciously crisp violin solos, David Watkin's virtuoso cello playing and Anthony Robson's characterful oboe solos for granted. Rinaldo Alessandrini directed, standing at the harpsichord. There were times when the rhythmic propulsion seemed to falter, something a more forceful personality than Alessandrinis may have prevented, but this was still a compelling performance."}, "isHosted": false}}}
