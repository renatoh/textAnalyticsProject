The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, warned northern leaders late on Monday night that if they fail to agree to pub closures and a ban on household mixing, the tier 3 measures will be brought in unilaterally. He said he would have to \u201cadvise the prime minister that despite our best endeavours we\u2019ve been unable to reach agreement.\u201d The statement, which came only hours after a government meeting with Greater Manchester leaders ended in chaos and confusion, makes it highly likely that tier 3 restrictions will be imposed on the region within 48 hours. Jenrick said: \u201cThe deteriorating public health situation in Greater Manchester means that we need to take action urgently. We have held discussions in good faith with local leaders for 10 days in order to ensure that the measures put in place were tailored to the local community. \u201cWe have offered an extensive package of support for local people and businesses, proportionate to the approach we have taken in the Liverpool city region and Lancashire and in addition to the wider national support.\u201d The high-stakes move was met with fury in Greater Manchester, where the Labour MP Andrew Gwynne accused the government of being \u201ccompletely contemptuous\u201d of the region, and council leaders said ministers had offered no compromise as they sought to close pubs, bars and other venues. Gwynne, the MP for Denton and Reddish in Stockport, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s disgraceful that the government still hasn\u2019t set out what their \u2018offer\u2019 is. Nor, I believe, have they notified the mayor or council leaders of this latest deadline. \u201cThey\u2019re just completely contemptuous of Greater Manchester with their spin, threats and demands when all we want are workable measures and proper protections for our businesses and residents after three months of failed local lockdowns already.\u201d Jenrick said there were now more Covid-19 patients in Greater Manchester hospitals than in \u201cthe whole of the south-west and south east combined\u201d. He added: \u201cBut unfortunately, despite recognising the gravity of the situation, local leaders have been so far unwilling to take the action that is required to get this situation under control. \u201cI have written to local leaders this evening to make clear that if we cannot reach agreement by midday tomorrow then I must advise the prime minister that despite our best endeavours we\u2019ve been unable to reach agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late for local leaders to work with us to take action for the sake of the people of Greater Manchester.\u201d In Jenrick\u2019s letter to Greater Manchester council leaders, released late on Monday night, he says the government is offering them \u00a322m in financial support, which equates to approximately \u00a38 per head for the 2.8m population. It contrasts with an offer of \u00a344m for Merseyside\u2019s 1.5m population and Lancashire\u2019s \u00a342m for 1.5 million people. Yet there was a suggestion that last-minute negotiations might yield more cash for Greater Manchester. Lucy Powell, the Labour MP for Manchester Central, responded to Jenrick\u2019s statement by tweeting: \u201cWill they now engage in meaningful discussions then? Only two meaningful ministerial meetings [have] taken place so far.\u201d Sean Fielding, the Labour leader of Oldham council, said: \u201cA deal would require both sides to compromise and consistently they\u2019ve offered no compromise from the position they\u2019ve had since the beginning. Why are they pretending this is a negotiation when they\u2019re not prepared to negotiate?\u201d The move also risks infuriating influential Conservative MPs including Graham Brady and William Wragg, who both represent Greater Manchester constituencies and have made clear their opposition to tier 3 measures. Sir Richard Leese, the leader of Manchester city council, said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d with the government ultimatum. He said: \u201cThere seems to be a real unwillingness from the government to listen to reason. I think they\u2019ve tabled fairly badly worked-out regulations and are now refusing to recognise that and enter into a serious negotiation.\u201d Leese said there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that closing pubs and bars would bring down the high rates of infection or slow the rising number of hospital patients. He said he hoped that ministers would not impose tier 3 restrictions and that they would be able to reach an agreement before the noon deadline, but that seemed like a distant prospect. The government\u2019s ultimatum came just six hours after a meeting between Jenrick and Greater Manchester leaders ended in disarray, prompting the mayor, Andy Burnham, to express his disappointment at the abrupt manner of the discussion. In a statement earlier on Monday night, Burnham said he and council leaders were \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d that Jenrick had withdrawn the offer of a hardship fund to help the low-paid only hours after government officials had proposed it. One council leader described the call with Jenrick and Boris Johnson\u2019s chief strategic adviser, Sir Eddie Lister, as \u201cvery strange\u201d. Another said it started positively, with talk of a new \u201chardship fund\u201d to help the lowest paid, but the idea was killed before the meeting ended as government officials said the Treasury would not provide any more cash. \u201cIt was crazy. Something collapsed on the government\u2019s side during the meeting,\u201d said one. As well as Greater Manchester, nearly 2 million people in South Yorkshire are expected to be placed under the strictest Covid restrictions within days. As the Welsh government announced a two-week national \u201cfirebreak\u201d from Friday, Hancock said discussions were continuing about placing large parts of northern England in tier 3 measures this week. It is understood that the Sheffield city region, population 1.8 million, looks to be the closest to agreeing a deal with government, though it is some way from being finalised. An influx of students has helped Sheffield\u2019s infection rate soar to 345 cases in every 100,000 people, more than double the England average, while Barnsley\u2019s is nearly 400, just below the rates in parts of Greater Manchester and Merseyside. Three sources said they expected a Sheffield city region deal to be announced within days. One said they were not as opposed to tier 3 measures as leaders in Greater Manchester and that they expected their financial package to be similar to the \u00a342m deal given to the Liverpool city region and Lancashire last week. One senior South Yorkshire figure said: \u201cWe know our numbers are rising too fast. Government I think would have liked to bounce us into an agreement today, despite the fact I think there have only been two conversations in total, but that\u2019s not going to happen. I don\u2019t know why they want to use councils as political human shields on this stuff.\u201d In the Commons, Hancock thanked leaders in Lancashire for striking a tier 3 agreement on Friday and, in a message aimed at Burnham, said: \u201cI\u2019m sure that the willingness to put politics aside in the national interest and in the interests of the people we serve, will save lives and protect livelihoods.\u201d Discussions were ongoing with leaders in West Yorkshire, Nottingham, north-east England and Teesside, Hancock told MPs. He said it was \u201cabsolutely vital\u201d to act in Greater Manchester, where he said the infection rate among over-60s had risen over the past week from 171 cases for every 100,000 people to 280. The rate in Liverpool is 401 cases for every 100,000, and in Lancashire 241 per 100,000. Hancock told the Commons that discussions were continuing with local leaders about introducing tier 3 measures \u2013 meaning the closure of many pubs, bars and other venues \u2013 across parts of northern England. The government piled pressure on Burnham by saying that all free intensive care capacity in Greater Manchester would be used by the middle of next week if rates continued to rise, according to its own modelling. But this was questioned by Prof Jane Eddleston, the region\u2019s medical lead for the coronavirus response. She said that despite the \u201cstark\u201d figures, extra capacity would be available. \u201cThe system can cope. If one looks at the stark figures one might be mistaken for thinking \u2018oh gosh\u2019. But that does not take into account the additional capacity that will come into play,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
