In a speech to a CBI summit on skills, the head of the UK's biggest private-sector employer will pledge Tesco to improving the quality of training but tell ministers that they cannot expect companies to make good the failings of schools. Sir Terry will say that companies should see investment in training as a way of improving profits rather than as a way of ticking a social responsibility box, but will add: \"What we cannot do is act as a bandage or a sticking plaster for the failures of some parts of our education system. At the risk of stating the obvious, the long-term solution has got to start in our schools. \"Too many children have been leaving school after 11 or 13 years of compulsory education without the basic skills to get on in life and hold down a job. Employers can - and should - add to the basics in the training we offer, but it's going to be an uphill struggle if the basics aren't there in the first place.\" The Tesco chief executive will say that business needs employees with social skills - the ability to work in teams and communicate - and highlight figures from the government-commissioned Leitch review that showed 5 million British adults lacked basic numeracy skills, 17 million had problems with numbers and one in six were leaving school unable to read, write or add up properly. \"Those figures certainly mean that business has problems in finding people with the skills they need to carry out jobs in a technologically more challenging age. But on a human level they represent a terrible waste of potential, limiting social mobility and reducing opportunity. And they lead to some of the social problems which we hear about all too often at the moment.\" Speaking at the same conference, John Denham, the secretary of state for innovation, universities and skills, will admit that more will have to be done by schools, companies and the government. \"We must be in the world's premier league for skills. In the OECD we are 18th for low skills, 20th for intermediate skills and 11th for high skills. To be competitive in a global economy, to reach 80% participation in employment and to offer new opportunities to people in work, we must do better.\" The prime minister has made improving skills one of the goals for his administration and launched the government's skills pledge in the summer - an attempt to persuade companies to ensure that their employees were trained to bring them up to the level of a school-leaver with five GCSEs of grades A-C. Mr Denham will say that ministers face three obstacles - the sheer scale of the challenge, changing the culture around training and Britain's \"deep-seated attitudes towards it\", and transforming the system to meet employers' needs. Sir Terry, who will announce today that Tesco has signed the skills pledge on behalf of its 280,000 workers, will argue that deficiencies in skills and training had been documented by reports going back to Victorian times but that the scale of the challenge is now being highlighted by the efforts being made by India and China to develop more educated workforces. \"If reports were the answer, we would have the most highly trained workforce in the world. But just because it is an old problem, it doesn't make it less urgent. Indeed, with globalisation it is clearly becoming more acute.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
