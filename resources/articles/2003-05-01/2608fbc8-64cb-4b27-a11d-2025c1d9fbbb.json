Speaking for the first time since it was revealed that she had appointed Arbeit, who was implicated in playing a major role in East Germany's state-sponsored doping programme, as her conditioning and throwing advisor, Lewis said she was not about to be swayed by adverse publicity. She said Arbeit is playing a crucial role in her return to competition, which begins with the European Cup Combined Events meeting in Estonia in July. The Olympic heptathlon champion was introduced to Arbeit by Frank Dick, the former British national coach, who took overall control of her training last autumn. \"When I found myself without a coach after the [2000] Olympics, help was not exactly forthcoming from anyone in this country. I don't remember anyone coming forward to offer support,\" Lewis said. \"If people here choose not to help me, there is not much I can do. I need the best help, advice and support I can get and, if that's not from within the country I reside, then so be it.\" It is rumoured that her former advisor, Charles van Commenee, dropped Lewis when he discovered she was pregnant and doubted her determination to make a comeback, something Lewis disputes. \"We didn't part company for that reason,\" she says. \"That is all speculation and rumour.\" And she insists her move to work with Arbeit and others is justifiable. \"Every phase of my training needs to be addressed. I need the best team possible around me. Sometimes you have to reach out further to gain a greater knowledge about different things,\" she said. \"I need to be better, stronger and faster and I need people who can show me how to achieve that. Some people aren't ambitious enough to liaise with coaches from around the world. Other people are shallow about it. But not me.\" For two decades Arbeit was employed as the East German athletics coach and worked with the GDR team as head coach from 1989 to 1990. Evidence suggests that he was involved in the systematic doping of athletes during this time and that he was also an informer for the Stasi, the state secret police. Lewis has visited Arbeit at his base in Germany several times since she resumed full training after the birth of her daughter Lauren 13 months ago. \"I've become a bit of a nomad, travelling to train all the time,\" she says. \"Luckily my mum is available to look after Lauren when I am training, otherwise it would be more difficult to balance. But it will only be this way for a couple of years.\" Lewis says she has become increasingly frustrated with what she perceives as persistent negative coverage in the British press since she won her gold medal in Sydney three years ago. \"I rarely read any of the press any more but, if I do, it is predominantly negative stuff about me,\" she says. \"I always ask the media to put themselves in my shoes and to think what they would do if they needed the best coaching advice. They're not supportive. It is a good job I am made of strong stuff or I would have crumbled by now. They are trying to break me but they won't succeed.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
