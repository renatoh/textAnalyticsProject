The image of a nipple that acts as a temperature dial and another of a tropical island shaped like a bottom were strangely familiar, and he claims, brazen copies of his own work. Sperlich is one of a group of artists who have claimed that the team behind the pop star\u2019s video stole their ideas without crediting them. For the Berlin-based artist \u2013 whose work is posted on Instagram, where he has more than 400,000 followers \u2013 it was just the latest case of his concepts being allegedly lifted wholesale from the web without permission or credit. \u201cIt\u2019s not cool to just take something; it\u2019s copyright infringement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like riding on a bus without a ticket \u2013 they don\u2019t think anything is going to happen to them. They assume you\u2019re just a young Instagram artist online and don\u2019t have the resources to hire a lawyer and seek justice.\u201d The Wobble Up case is the latest in a string of incidents in which artists, who are often at the start of their careers and have strong followings on social media, have their work allegedly copied by well known pop stars without their consent or credit. The Russian-born surrealist painter and gallery owner Vladimir Kush is in a legal battle with Ariana Grande\u2019s record label in the US over the use of an image in the video for God Is Woman, which he claimed lifts an idea from one of his paintings. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a settlement,\u201d said Kush. \u201cThat\u2019s usually what happens. I have no doubt in my mind that it will be proven immediately that it is a rip off.\u201d Kendrick Lamar\u2019s legal team reached a settlement with the British-Liberian artist Lina Lina Iris Viktor, who argued that the rapper\u2019s video for All The Stars borrowed from her Constellations series of black and gold paintings. Viktor had turned down several requests to use her work and her solicitors called the video \u201can egregious violation of federal law and an affront to the artist, her livelihood, her legacy and to artists everywhere.\u201d But for Sperlich and the other artists who said their work looked similar to the images in the Wobble Up video \u2013 including Tony Futura, Vanessa McKeown, Catherine Losing, Paul Fuentes and Jamie Calderon \u2013 no permission was sought, they have claimed. \u201cI\u2019m super selective,\u201d said Sperlich, explaining why he would probably not have agreed to a request. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get my work into the art world. Why did they do it in a music video? I have no idea what they were thinking.\u201d Tim Maxwell, who is an arts partner at the legal firm Charles Russell Speechlys, said many copyright cases came from ignorance on the part of the music video directors and artist\u2019s creative teams. \u201cThey assume people won\u2019t object,\u201d he said. \u201cThey assume they can use it freely. There\u2019s this idea that once it\u2019s in the public domain, it\u2019s ok to use. The defences are incredibly naive.\u201d Maxwell said the legal repercussion could be serious, depending on the reach of the work that has been produced. He said: \u201cOne poster on a bus stop might not mean too much, but if it\u2019s used in a music video that has a global reach, the damages could be significant.\u201d Some artists, he added, have started to crowdfund to try to cover the legal costs of a copyright case. Sperlich could see some positives from his work allegedly being used by other artists. He said: \u201cTo be honest, if you really see it without any emotions, it\u2019s good that this happens. Because it means you\u2019re doing something good. \u201cBut I have a community with over 400,000 followers and I got a message 15 minutes after the video launched. And that hasn\u2019t stopped. I get reminded that they stole my work everyday.\u201d Representatives for Chris Brown and Sony did not respond to requests for comment from the Guardian."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
