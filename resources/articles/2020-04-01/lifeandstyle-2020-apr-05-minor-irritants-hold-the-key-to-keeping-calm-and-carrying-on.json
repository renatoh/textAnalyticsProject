It\u2019s not very Blitz spirit, I know. But, actually, it is a way of keeping calm and carrying on: it\u2019s just that carrying on in my world involves a relatively high level of irritation most of the time. We are usually exhorted to think of happier things when times are tough \u2013 and there are plenty of those, even for naturally peevish types like me. I love the gradual unfurling of the natural world at this time of year: the sun is absurdly welcome, before hayfever and heat rash kick in, and every few hours there\u2019s a new bud or shoot. I enjoy watching the blue tits in the yard, chattering and squabbling over seeds and my dog\u2019s tender pink belly exposed as he lies, limbs akimbo and face saggy with deep relaxation. But thinking of these things now takes on an elegiac quality that intensifies my anxiety: life is full of beauty and joy \u2013 and it feels fragile. In contrast, if I focus on the trivial things that still annoy me \u2013 because despite the existential threat, I have inexplicably failed to enter a state of total saintly forbearance \u2013 I find it obscurely calming. My friend F and I have been doing this intermittently for months, after she suggested I read The Madwoman in the Volvo, US writer Sandra Tsing Loh\u2019s darkly hilarious account of her perimenopausal semi-madness. In it she discusses those \u201cquotidian irritants that can cause the elevator to drop\u201d, which she calls \u201cgloomlets\u201d. Loh\u2019s include the colour yellow, muffins and \u201cthe food samples at Trader Joe\u2019s \u2013 so limited, so always disappointing\u201d. Even before things became terrible, I found sharing sources of irritation took their sting away. Once I had written them down, I could laugh at their \u2013 my \u2013 essential ridiculousness. Now, faced with genuinely unmanageable problems, there\u2019s an odd \u201clife goes on\u201d reassurance to trotting them out. Exercising my pettiness muscles, weakened by pervasive dread, seems to help, somehow. Maybe give it a try? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re no longer annoyed by little things, cheek by jowl with your nearest and dearest for prolonged periods. I\u2019ll get you started: I have both gloomlets and ragelets, which are equally effective. 1. My neighbour keeps putting his rubbish in my recycling box: single-use plastic, aerosols, a coffee jar full of fag butts. This is enraging on two levels: first, the absolute cheek of it, get your own box, you chancer. Second, and more subtly infuriating, he has ruined my unblemished record with the recycling people, for which I was hoping to win an award one day. Most Diligent Recycler, perhaps. No longer. 2. Who is hoarding nail clippers and why won\u2019t they admit it? Often in the evenings I hear the phantom sound of nails being cut and follow it like a woman possessed, throwing open doors and making accusations, but no, everyone says they were \u201cjust playing with the remote control\u201d or \u201cwhy are you here, please go away\u201d. I\u2019m not fooled. 3. The kidnap of the Good Towel \u2013 99% of our towels were pensioned out of a holiday cottage business in the 1990s as being too threadbare for paying customers. We do, however, have one huge, fluffy one, acquired in a fit of uncharacteristic extravagance. I do not remember the last time I got a turn of the Good Towel: whenever I launder and put it away, it vanishes, instantly, turning up weeks later, damp and smelly. It\u2019s not on. 4. The area under the salad drawer in the fridge is permanently flooded. Just when I had finally reclaimed it from four hibernating tortoises (don\u2019t ask), I now have to deal with a tide of fetid water whenever I try to make lunch. 5. Limescale. Something happened when I turned 40: now limescale genuinely upsets me. I wish to return to a more innocent time when the state of the kettle didn\u2019t ruin my morning. 6. I don\u2019t want to admit this, but in the spirit of togetherness in the face of adversity I will: it turns out the strange irritation on my scalp is ringworm. Ringworm! How the hell did I get ringworm? It\u2019s the kind of thing a Victorian reformer would deplore in a pamphlet about afflicted street urchins. I blame my habit of patting every passing dog, but given the current intensive scrutiny of hygiene, everyone thinks I\u2019m just a bit gross. Even the pharmacist recoiled when I told him and it\u2019s his job not to look disgusted. I could go on. I will go on, muttering away, self-soothing with a litany of minor complaints. How bad can it really be, I suppose I\u2019m thinking, if I\u2019m still annoyed by ringworm and limescale? Perhaps soon I\u2019ll find my husband\u2019s incessant foot tapping a welcome distraction, but thankfully we\u2019re not quite there yet.
