Mr Murdoch, one of the world's most influential media executives, foresaw a future where newspapers could be forced to convert into internet news sites and audiences gained power from the media \"old elite\" - proprietors such as himself. \"So, media becomes like fast food - people will consume it on the go, watching news, sport and film clips as they travel to and from work on mobiles or handheld wireless devices like Sony's PSP, or others already in test by our satellite companies,\" the News Corp chairman told an audience in London. \"As I have said, newspapers may become news-sites,\" he said in the annual livery lecture at The Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers. But Mr Murdoch, whose many media interests include the Times and the Sun newspapers and BSkyB, said news organisations with must-read and must-have content delivered via the right medium would endure. But he warned that advancing technology would change the old world order forever. \"Societies or companies that expect a glorious past to shield them from the forces of change driven by advancing technology will fail and fall. \"Power is moving away from the old elite in our industry - the editors, the chief executives and, let's face it, the proprietors. \"A new generation of media consumers has risen demanding content delivered when they want it, how they want it, and very much as they want it. \"This new media audience - and we are talking here of tens of millions of young people around the world - is already using technology, especially the web, to inform, entertain and above all to educate themselves. \"This knowledge revolution empowers the reader, the student, the cancer patient, the victim of injustice, anyone with a vital need for the right information.\" Mr Murdoch was upbeat on the future of journalism. \"The answer is that great journalism will always attract readers. The words, pictures and graphics that are the stuff of journalism have to be brilliantly packaged; they must feed the mind and move the heart. \"And, crucially, newspapers must give readers a choice of accessing their journalism in the pages of the paper or on websites such as Times Online or - and this is important - on any platform that appeals to them, mobile phones, hand-held devices, ipods, whatever. He titled his speech \"The dawn of a new age of discovery: media 2006\" and said the developing technologies had to power to destroy both companies and whole countries. \"For instance, we probably haven't heard the name of what will be the world's largest company in 2020. Indeed that company may not even exist yet - although I hope that it does, and that I know its name!\" He said that humanity was living through a \"second great age of discovery\" comparable to the great European explorers who discovered the New World 600 years ago such as Christopher Columbus. \"But we must not lose our nerve. We must be prepared to take risks and accept that we will make mistakes, sometimes very large ones. Above all we must have what those great seafaring explorers had in abundance - the courage to use the technological change that is unfolding around us to help make a better world.\" Mr Murdoch forecast that the web would become the prime media channel for information, entertainment, business and social contact. He praised for the News Corp-owned MySpace.com networking website, where young people talked online about music, film, dating, travel, and shared pictures, videos and blogs, forming virtual communities. It is believed that News International will expand the site into Britain using newspaper websites such as the Sun and Times Online at the end of the year. \"Today one of our great challenges is to understand and seize the opportunities presented by the web,\" he said \"But the history of that revolution is not one in which the new wipes out the old. Radio did not destroy newspapers, television did not destroy radio and neither eliminated the printing of books. \"Each wave of new technology in our industry forced an improvement in the old. Each new medium forced its predecessor to become more creative and more relevant to the consumer.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
