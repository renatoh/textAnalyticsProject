The Brazil-born midfielder, a key component of the Villarreal side that reached the Champions League semi-finals last season and a member of Spain's side at the World Cup finals, admitted yesterday that a deal is being discussed. While the 30-year-old would be content to remain at El Madrigal should no agreement be struck, he appears equally willing to move to Old Trafford. \"I know they are negotiating a transfer and I hope they sort things out as soon as possible, so I know what my future will be,\" said Senna. \"To be honest, Villarreal opened their doors for me and I am very happy here. The club have signed some good new players and I have always said my ambition is to win a title with this club. This season would be a great chance to do that. But we will see.\" Patrick Vieira, another player to interest Sir Alex Ferguson as a replacement for Roy Keane, will not be returning to the Premiership with United after agreeing to move from relegated Juventus to Internazionale. The start of the 2006-07 Serie A season has been put back until the weekend of September 9-10, the Italian Football League announced yesterday. Serie A and Serie B were scheduled to begin on August 27 but will now start a fortnight later in the wake of Italy's match-fixing scandal. Juventus have lodged an appeal with the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) against the sanctions imposed on the club, and Fiorentina and Lazio are expected to follow suit. The announcement will be seen as a precautionary measure as CONI may not reach its verdict until August 24-25."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
