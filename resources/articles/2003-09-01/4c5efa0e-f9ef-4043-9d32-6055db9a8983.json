The little girl's family have said that Spanish doctors retained all her organs without their permission after a postmortem examination into her death while on holiday. The doctors say they complied fully with Spanish law. Her death illustrates the very different approach for organ transplants between Spain and the UK. In the UK, the health service operates on the basis of an opt-in system, so each person's consent has to be explicitly given before their death - such as by carrying a donor card or joining the national donor register - or agreement reached with close relatives afterwards. However Spain operates on the basis of presumed consent. Relatives may still be asked for approval before transplants occur - as Megan's parents were before giving permission for her liver and kidneys to save three other children's lives - but the assumption is made that organs will be available after death unless the person or their relatives have opposed this. In Spain, that approach is combined with what some might see as ghoulish regular checks on possible donors among those in intensive care or emergency units, and a poor record of road safety leading to more healthy young people being killed in car accidents. The result is that Spain has a far higher rate of transplantation than the UK, US or even other opt-in countries, and far fewer Spaniards needing organs face delay, pain or death while waiting for a donor. Meanwhile, thousands of people live and die in misery in the UK while entirely suitable organs are lost as overworked doctors try to obtain consent in time for a transplant operation to have a reasonable chance of success. This is not just a tragedy but a massive cost to the health service and this country, whether in lost earnings or the expense of dialysis and other treatments. Transplant experts have said that when relatives are asked in good time they are usually comforted to think that some good will come from their family's loss. Some good is an understatement: up to nine people's lives can be transformed by a single donor, since transplantation today goes well beyond the expected heart, kidneys and liver to lungs, pancreas, small bowel, corneas, heart valves, bone and skin. Given the complexity and urgency of life-and-death emergencies, an opt-in system simply fails to deliver what individuals in great need and this society requires. We need debate and careful precautions, education and great sensitivity to beliefs, but the time is long overdue for a change to presumed consent. \u00b7 Journalist and media consultant Nick Cater also contributes to the humanitarian portal AlertNet.
