Anuj Bidve, who was with nine friends, was shot in the head at point blank range in Salford after a \"very short\" conversation with his killers. Police are still unclear about the motive and believe it to be a random attack as Bidve was staying at a local budget hotel and is not thought to have known his killers. Witnesses say that the postgraduate electronics student at Lancaster University was asked the time before a gun was pulled on him. A 16-year-old, two 17-year-olds and a 19-year-old are being held in custody on suspicion of murder in connection with the attack. Police say that after the gun was fired, Bidve's killer fled into the night in the direction of the Ordsall estate, near the scene of a fatal shooting in September. Chief Superintendent Kevin Mulligan, divisional commander for Salford, said: \"This is a fast moving investigation and we now have four people in custody. Those people will be questioned throughout the day by detectives and it is important we do not speculate on the possible motives for this murder. \"However, I would still appeal to anyone who has information about the murder to come forward. While we have made arrests, this is just the beginning of our investigation and we need people to come forward with anything they know.\" Mulligan praised the community response. \"I want to take this opportunity to praise the response of the Ordsall community who are clearly outraged by the murder of this young man and have come forward with information that is greatly assisting the investigation. We absolutely need this support to continue.\" \"We know this incident has attracted huge interest not just in Salford, not just in Manchester, but across the world. I want to stress that we are continuing to work with all our partners and key community contacts to keep them informed, and as soon as any developments in the case are made we will share these publicly.\" He added that a liaison officer was keeping Bidve's family in Pune, south-west India, fully informed about the investigation. Responding to criticisms that the emergency services were slow to attend the scene of the murder, police said that an armed response unit was in Salford within 10 minutes of receiving the distressed phone call. \"Greater Manchester police received the initial call about the shooting at 1.35am, and armed response officers were on the scene at 1.45am. When a call is made reporting the use of a gun, trained firearms officers must be sent to the scene,\" they said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
