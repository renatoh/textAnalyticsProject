Crewe, the Guardian can reveal, have also begun preparing for a number of civil claims by bringing in specialist lawyers \u2013 appointed on behalf of the club by the Football League\u2019s insurers \u2013 who have defended a child sex abuse claim relating to the Roman Catholic church. In legal documents seen by this newspaper Crewe set out their reasons for denying liability for Bennell\u2019s crimes, arguing that the club should not have to pay damages and that it would be \u201cquite impossible\u201d to have a fair trial relating to events from the 1980s and 1990s. Bennell\u2019s crimes, according to Crewe, were \u201cnot committed in the course of his duties\u201d as the club\u2019s youth-team coach. In the first cases of their kind since Bennell was convicted last year of 50 specimen charges relating to 12 boys, aged eight to 14, from 1979 to 1991, two of his victims have lodged claims for at least \u00a3200,000 in damages after being left with post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol issues, depression and, in one case, having to be talked out of a suicide attempt by a police negotiator. Crewe\u2019s response in both cases is that the club are not liable for any psychological damage caused by the trauma or \u201cthe consequence of other life choices made by the claimant [player] which had not worked out as he had hoped or which he now otherwise regrets\u201d. Legal papers show: \u2022 Crewe claim that when boys stayed overnight with Bennell it was because of arrangements he must have had with the parents, rather than anything organised via the club. \u2022 The club want the case to be thrown out under the 1980 Limitation Act on the grounds there is \u201cno adequate explanation\u201d why Bennell\u2019s victims did not launch action earlier. \u2022 Crewe deny Railway Juniors \u2013 a team coached by Bennell, wearing the club\u2019s official kit and training on adjacent pitches to the stadium \u2013 had anything to do with the club, other than occasionally supplying the team\u2019s strips. Crewe are using the law firm Keoghs to represent them and Ian Carroll, a legal director in its Liverpool office, has signed the documents on behalf of the club. Carroll is described on the Legal 500 website as a specialist in abuse cases who \u201cdoes \u2018first-class\u2019 work in this area, especially in religious claims\u201d. He is also recognised as an expert in limitation, the legal term for arguing that long delays can prejudice court cases, and used this last year while successfully defending a case involving alleged abuse by a now-deceased teacher, Michael Riddle, at a Roman Catholic seminary in the 1970s. The issue of limitation also features prominently in Crewe\u2019s defence, which argues that the players should have reported the abuse within three years. \u201cWhile [Bennell] is still alive and potentially able to give evidence, other witnesses who might have been able to assist the defendant [Crewe], even if still alive and traceable, could not reasonably be expected to have any reliable recollection.\u201d The explanation from one player, who was abused from the age of 11 to 14, is that he was shamed into silence, fearful of the distress it would cause his family and frightened that, if he spoke out, it would end his chances of a football career. He was taunted by his teammates because of his apparent closeness to Bennell and had never been able to disclose what had happened to anyone, apart from close family, until another victim, Andy Woodward, waived his anonymity by speaking to the Guardian in November 2016. Crewe say that is not satisfactory. \u201cThere is no, or no adequate, explanation,\u201d the club\u2019s barrister, Nicholas Fewtrell, responds in an eight-page written defence. \u201cIn particular, this is not a case where the claimant was \u2026 disabled from commencing proceedings by any psychological injuries that he had suffered. On the contrary [he] disclosed the alleged abuse to his parents in 1991/92 and to his wife in or about 2005. Yet [he] did not instruct his present solicitors until August 2017.\u201d The delay, according to Crewe\u2019s legal team, means \u201cit would not be possible \u2026 to disentangle the effect of the alleged abuse from the effects of the claimant\u2019s other damaging life experiences.\u201d The second player, who was 13 when Bennell abused him, still suffers flashbacks more than 30 years on and, according to a consultant psychiatrist, the abuse has had such a \u201cmajor, long-lasting effect \u2026 even with treatment it will continue to affect him indefinitely\u201d. That player also says he was too ashamed and fearful of the consequences to speak up as a teenager. Crewe say that is not a reasonable explanation. Now 65, Bennell is serving his fourth prison sentence as well as facing the possibility of another criminal trial involving at least nine complainants. At least 97 people have reported him \u2013 a figure not updated since January 2018 \u2013 on the back of Woodward\u2019s interview and in the vast majority of cases it relates to Bennell\u2019s time at Crewe or, previously, when he was a coach and scout in Manchester City\u2019s junior network. City are also facing a number of high court claims and, without accepting liability, have launched an optional \u201csurvivors\u2019 scheme\u201d to offer their former players out-of-court settlements. Crewe\u2019s legal argument is that it is for the relevant players to prove \u201cthe alleged sexual assaults (being not admitted)\u201d happened on the club\u2019s watch. Legal documents submitted on Crewe\u2019s behalf state that Railway Juniors \u2013 a feeder team, according to the players\u2019 legal representatives \u2013 was set up by parents and run independently, even though the club acknowledge supplying the kit. Bennell, according to Crewe, must have had \u201cpersonal arrangements\u201d with the parents to let boys stay overnight. The club say there is no record of them paying Bennell to accommodate players that way. \u201cThe fact [Bennell] may have deceived the players\u2019 parents about the underlying purpose of these stays is nothing to the point,\u201d Crewe\u2019s legal defence adds. Dino Nocivelli, an associate solicitor at Bolt Burdon Kemp, which is representing the players, told the Guardian: \u201cIt is disappointing when defendants such as Crewe Alexandra look to take limitation as a technical point. It is commonly accepted that it takes survivors years to be able to disclose their abuse, if at all. I would like defendants in all abuse cases to recognise the inappropriateness of raising a limitation defence and the impact this has on survivors as it only serves to add substantial insult to the injuries that have been inflicted by the abuse.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
