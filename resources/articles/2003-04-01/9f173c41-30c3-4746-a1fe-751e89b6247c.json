The 33-year-old former accountant stepped down last week after he was arrested on suspicion of possessing indecent images of children. Mr Morgan is denying the allegation and he has not been charged with any offence. A North Tyneside council spokesman said an election would be held on June 12 - a week earlier than had been planned. Mr Morgan was elected to the \u00a350,000-a-year post mayor last May with a majority of 2,228 votes over his Labour rival. The polling day has been brought forward following a formal request by the council's Liberal Democrat deputy leader Graeme Brett."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
