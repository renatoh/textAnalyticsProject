Nein. It's an unpretty word however you say it. Yet the N-word has been bandied around a lot in the past couple of weeks in a row between George Osborne and his counterparts in the eurozone over whether Britain should contribute to an IMF war chest. Two things should be said about this battle. First, the eurozone needs to stop being so childish. Second, David Cameron and co should grow up. In that sense this argument sums up much that is wrong with the relationship between Britain and the rest of Europe. At the end of the 9 December summit, eurozone leaders agreed to provide \u20ac200bn (\u00a3166bn) \"to ensure that the IMF has adequate resources to deal with the crisis\" in southern Europe. While not allowed to fund member states, the European Central Bank can lend to the fund \u2013 as national central banks have done before. The pledge sent markets surging, as it offered the eurozone a ready source of money without troublesome legal treaties. Except Europe's leaders had arrived at the \u20ac200bn figure without lining up the money. What the single currency leaders effectively thought was: we need this money, therefore we'll claim it's in the post. Unsurprisingly, when the eurozone asked the UK to stump up part of the cash (around \u20ac30bn, it is thought), Mr Osborne refused \u2013 unless India, China and others from the Group of 20 joined in. The euro club must take the lion's share of the blame for this mess. The agreement of 9 December is now revealed not only as bad economics but fantasy finance. More broadly, the latest deal demonstrates again how northern Europe keeps trying to avoid the bill for the eurozone crisis \u2013 and thereby ends up in an even greater mess. No one should underestimate how hard it will be for Angela Merkel, Nicolas Sarkozy and the rest to go to their electorates to ask for billions to lend or give to Italy, Spain and the rest. But each deferment only raises the stakes (and the cost) for the euro club. For their part, coalition ministers are playing good politics by refusing to throw more money at the great euro fiasco. Yet in insisting on a \"big bazooka\" and on IMF involvement in the crisis, and then refusing even to engage with the proposals, Mr Cameron looks tactical rather than strategic, let alone constructive. Britain's economic fortunes are tied up with what happens in euroland, and when the great day of disaster arrives, probably next year, the UK's economy and its banks will not get off lightly. Any solution to this mess will inevitably involve many governments and organisations, both within the eurozone and outside it. By then Mr Cameron will need all the solvent friends he can get in Europe and the IMF. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 December 2011. It originally stated that \"no one can underestimate\" how hard it will be for leaders such as Merkel and Sarkozy to go to their electorates to ask for billions for eurozone bailouts. This should have read \"no one should underestimate\" and has now been corrected"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
