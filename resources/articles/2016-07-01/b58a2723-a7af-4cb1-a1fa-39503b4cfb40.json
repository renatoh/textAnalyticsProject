The transcripts in the case of Brock Turner, the 20-year-old swimmer convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman, offer fresh insight into how the former student\u2019s lawyers interrogated the woman he assaulted and provide a window into a criminal process that advocates say can be unfair and painful for victims. Turner\u2019s attorney, Mike Armstrong, questioned the woman, who was not a Stanford student and was 22 years old at the time of the assault, about her drinking and partying in college, the records show. Turner was convicted of assault with intent to rape an intoxicated woman and sexually penetrating an intoxicated and unconscious person with a foreign object. Two bystanders caught him \u201cthrusting\u201d on top of the motionless woman outside a fraternity house by a dumpster on 18 January 2015. The case sparked international outrage in June when Turner was sentenced to six months in county jail, which is significantly lighter than the minimum punishment of two years in state prison prescribed by law. The victim\u2019s emotional impact statement outlined the horrific details of the assault and the ensuing trauma of a prolonged trial, and the judge who gave the sentence is now facing a high-profile recall campaign. The documents released on Tuesday are from a 21 March hearing, when the victim, identified as Jane Doe, faced questions from the prosecutors and the defense attorney. \u201cAt the beginning of your testimony on Friday, you gave us your height and weight. Were those numbers that you gave us what your height and weight was on January 17th of 2015?\u201d Armstrong said at the start of his cross-examination, referring to her earlier testimony about her figure. \u201cEstimating, yes,\u201d Jane Doe responded. Armstrong asked her again if \u201cnothing is radically different\u201d with her weight and height. \u201cNo,\u201d she replied. In one part of the statement she later released, the woman wrote about the way this line of questioning was hurtful. \u201cThe sexual assault had been so clear, but instead, here I was at the trial, answering question like: \u2018How old are you? How much do you weigh? What did you eat that day? Well what did you have for dinner? Who made dinner?\u2019\u201d Armstrong proceeded to ask the woman about her behavior at a fraternity party that she attended with her sister. Referencing earlier testimony, he asked her if it was an intentional choice \u201cwhen you drank the quantity of vodka in the red cup. You drank it all down at once, right?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, chugged it,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd that was a decision you made, right?\u201d Armstrong reminded her that these events occurred after she had already graduated from college, asking: \u201cAnd you did a lot of partying in college, right?\u201d Jane Doe said she would not consider herself a \u201cparty animal\u201d, before the lawyer said: \u201cWell, you did tell the police when you were interviewed that you did a lot of partying there too, right?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a social person,\u201d she said. He later asked her if she has suffered \u201cblackouts\u201d from drinking in the past. She said she had. The attorney further asked her in a lengthy series of questions why her phone might have been on silent that night. He later asked to confirm specifics of her dinner that night before she went out, which consisted of \u201cbroccoli and rice\u201d. The records also list some of the evidence reviewed in court, which highlight specifics of the assault and the impact on the woman. Photographs revealed that the woman had vegetation throughout her hair and \u201cmultiple abrasions\u201d in her buttocks, the report said. She also had abrasions at the base of her neck and upper back, according to the photo evidence. Despite that evidence and his eventual conviction, Turner has continued to argue that the assault was consensual, casting blame on Stanford\u2019s \u201cparty culture\u201d. His father faced widespread scorn for testifying that his son didn\u2019t deserve punishment for \u201c20 minutes of action\u201d. Court officials on Tuesday also released records of an 18 March hearing in which the victim answered questions by the prosecutor Alaleh Kianerci. During that court session, the victim provided a detailed account of the events leading up to the assault and the aftermath at a hospital. The woman appeared to get emotional when she recounted the moment she woke up at the hospital and regained consciousness. \u201cI woke up, and I saw, like, dry blood on my hands and my elbows and bandages,\u201d she said, later adding, \u201cI was really extremely tired and confused.\u201d Jane Doe went on to recount the moment she realized she may have been assaulted, which she has also written about extensively in her impact statement. \u201cMy underwear was gone,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is when it hit me that what the deputy \u2026 had been talking about was real. And I was suddenly very scared.\u201d Doctors then gave her shots for STDs, tested her for HIV and told her that she should get tested again in six months \u201cbecause results don\u2019t always show up immediately\u201d, the woman testified. The woman also said that when she went to Stanford that night, she had had no intention of hooking up with anybody and had no interest in Turner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
