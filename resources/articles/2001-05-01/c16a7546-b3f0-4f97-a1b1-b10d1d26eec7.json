Subs: Cesar, Savio, Campo, Conceicao, Munitis, Celades, Solari. Bayern Munich: Kahn, Sagnol, Lizarazu, Kuffour, Andersson, Scholl, Elber, Effenberg, Jeremies, Salihamidzic, Linke. Subs: Dreher, Sforza, Sergio, Tarnat, Jancker, Hargreaves, Santa Cruz. Referee: H Dallas (Scotland) 1 Real Madrid kick-off what is the biggest match of the season for both clubs, quite possibly ever, in the history of the universe if you believe the hype. Bayern are out prove that they are not an easy passage to the final for the Spanish side. 3 Roberto Carlos whips in a free-kick from distance to the head of Raul - goes for a corner, comes to nothing. 4 McManaman plays in Raul just outside the area - he turns and wafts his shot over the bar. 5 Free-kick to Bayern 25 yards out, square on - Jeremies darts off a crazy diversionary run (no-one pays him any attention at all) before Effenberg strolls up to poke the ball through a tiny gap in the Real wall. Easy for keeper Casillas with the sting taken off the ball. 9 Two free-kicks in succession for Bayern after Scholl and then Lizarazu try to cut in from the left and are upended; Effenberg fails to make use of both. 12 A fairly scrappy start and a conspicuous lack of rhythm to the game despite lots of movement from both sides. No chances and not much to get excited about so far. 16 Lizarazu almost blows it for Bayern when he allows Salgado to get around him and cross for Raul only three yards out... but he can't get his foot to it and the Germans survive. 19 Bayern break after a period of concerted pressure from Real - Effenberg finds Salihamidzic on the right as Real are caught short at the back, but Scholl wastes Salihamidzic's pass into the area and puts wide despite being under no pressure. 24 The pressure's back on Bayern and the Germans are reduced to attacking on the break. Roberto Carlos prowls around the edge of the area, popping balls in from the Real left, and is unlucky to find the side netting with a wayward, rocket-like cross. 26 Free-kick to Real just outside the area. Too close for Roberto Carlos? No way, but he crashes it into the wall. 35 Bayern beginning to step up the pace as Sagnol breaks down the right; his cross just fails to reach Elber at the far post. 37 Bayern steam up again with Salihamidzic and Scholl on the left; free-kick 35 yards out - Effenberg wafts in a looping ball towards the far top corner of the net... and misses by a mile. 38 Helguera mis-hits a cross into the six-yard box, both Guti and Kahn go for it but neither gets close. 42 Figo's corner for Real, cleared easily. And another from the same side, headed away by Linke. Half-time Good half from Bayern. They are sticking to a plan and are making Real work hard for their chances with a solid display at the back. Good movement on the break is catching Real short at the back and in danger of conceding the all-important away goal. Bayern will be pleased at the way the first half has gone. Not so Real, despite their territorial dominance. 46 Real have history against them if they fail to get a result tonight - they have never won in Munich. 47 McManaman cuts in from the left and finds Raul on the edge of the area; Raul lays it off for Figo but his shot goes nowhere. 49 Sagnol delivers a great ball from the right, but Salihamidzic just can't get his foot to it in the six-yard box. Very quiet in the stadium. 50 Figo's corner is headed clear at the near post. 53 Great chance for Real when Guti slips the ball through to McManaman on the left side of the area; McManaman shoots across Kahn but the Bayern keeper palms it away. 55 Substitution Savio on for Guti. 55 GOAL: Real Madrid 0 - 1 Bayern Munich Elber breaks the deadlock to put the Germans ahead with an away goal - belting 25 yard shot out of nothing that Casaillas should have stopped from squirming inside his right-hand post. 58 Kahn does well to deny Real an almost instant equaliser from McManaman's shot. Straight after that, Helguera heads over from six yards. More than sense of urgency about Real's game now. 60 All Real at the moment as they pepper the area. McManaman rampant on the left, lofting balls into the area. 61 Great save by Kahn when he gets down to deny Salgado from the the edge of the area. 70 Real have eased back a little and Bayern take full advantage when Scholl gets up on the right to test Casillas from distance. 71 Almost a spectacular equaliser from Roberto Carlos when tries an overhead kick from seven yards after Helguera plays him in from the edge of the area. 72 Substitution Paolo Sergio on for Scholl - no sitting back for Bayern. 73 Effenberg's corner finds Linke virtually unmarked beyond the far post; Casillas flaps Linke's header clear. 74 Substitution Jancker on for Elber. Bayern clearly have no intention of sitting on their lead, as manager Hitzfeld tries to intimidate Real with another attack-minded substitution. 77 Figo corner; Kahn flaps but Bayern clear. Substitution Munitis on for Salgado. 79 Booking Big blow for Bayern when Effenberg picks up a second yellow in the competition, meaning he will miss the second leg of this semi-final. Referee Dallas called him over for a chat and Effenberg blew any leeway he may have had when he appeared to shove the ref in frustration. 81 Real claim handball when Raul shoots from 10 yards from Figo's corner - nothing doing. 86 Booking Munitis for pointlessly chopping down Sagnol near the touchline. 87 Bayern now finally falling back in numbers as they attempt to cling on to their lead... 88 ... when Jeremies gets away on the left and tees up Paolo Sergio to shoot high when it could so easily have been the clincher. 90 Three minutes extra to play. Bayern free-kick 40 yards out; they take their time and it comes to nothing. Paolo Sergio goes down under pressure from Figo and tries to milk as much time out of it as possible. Another Bayern free-kick - Effenberg chips it over the wall from 25 yards but Jancker can't make it work. Full-time. Great performance by Bayern, now the only German team ever to win in the Bernebeu stadium. Real Madrid 0 - 1 Bayern Munich"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
