The Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT), which commissioned the report, says there is a \"devastating de-prioritisation\" of speech therapy services by local primary care trusts (PCTs). It claims that 78% of speech and language therapists across the UK have had their budgets reduced or frozen in the coming year. Jane MacKenzie, national policy officer at RCSLT, says many local speech and language therapy departments are now badly underfunded. She points to the situation in the Vale of Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, where speech therapists have been turning children away because of staff shortages. \"Earlier this year, the Home Office recognised speech and language therapists as an occupational shortage,\" she says. \"But our research shows that nearly two-thirds of managers say they are unable to take on any new therapists this year.\" Worse still, she says, is that 80% of 2006 speech and language therapy graduates have been unable to find jobs. \"This is madness when you consider that this year an NHS workforce review predicted that it will take 10 years until there are enough speech and language therapists to meet the needs of local communities,\" says MacKenzie. \"The reality on the ground is that local PCT commissioners are trying to balance their books by slashing so-called 'soft' services like speech and language therapy, with no consideration of central government policy or the long-term consequences of their actions.\" The college says there is more need for speech and language therapy intervention for children, thanks to better recognition of problems such as autism and learning difficulties. The rise in strokes and better cancer survival have also led to a spike in patients needing help. \"Being able to communicate is absolutely central to a patient's emotional and psychological wellbeing,\" says MacKenzie. \"It takes years to build up these services and they're being dismantled without any thought to the impact this will have on hundreds of lives.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
