When you take names out of games, people will still come. But not as many. And those who do don't get their full whack. It's like going to see a show with the stand-in instead of the star. It's still good. But it's not as advertised. Now, you can't knock schedulers. They're people doing their best, and trying to appease all the \"stakeholders\". But when the stakeholders are television people \u2013 and in effect schedulers \u2013 at the bottom of the food train is the stakeholder who pays for everything: the fan. Sure \u2013 Bulldogs v Roosters will be a good game. But like any good show, it needs its major players. Two and a Half Men without Charlie Sheen is one-and-a-half men and Demi Moore's ex. Origin needs its own weekend. Campbelldown And so Wests Tigers play a \"home\" game on Saturday night at one of the three venues they call home, Campbelltown Stadium. How many will they get there? Anything more than 10,000 will be a triumph. And probably a lie. Because the \"Wests\" part of this franchise feels disenfranchised, just as Steelers fans have the raw end of their joint venture's pineapple. Just how it is. The \"Balmain\" bit is stronger and the Campbelltown folks are slowly falling off. Plus it'll be fairly cold. And the Tigers are terrible. And while Canberra's missing some good players they should whip the locals like naughty boys. Hey \u2013 would you go to this game? Sunshine and lollipops Though the Eels are travelling like bad clowns on holiday and the Rabbitohs are top of the pops, this should still be a fair game of footy. Because it's played in what ancient rugby league people will remember as \"the day\". And in \"the day\" it's usually dry, which means players' hands and feet have better purchase. Hence better games than at night. Television demands that six of eight games a week are at nighttime. And that's fair enough because money rules the world. But smart fans know \u2013 if you're looking for a spectacle and the weekend's best entertainment, then the games the sun's up take the Chupa-Chups. Titans to upset Storm? Storm have reshuffled their pack with their four best players off to Origin. Gareth Widdop moves to full-back (interesting), journeyman funny-man Brett Finch slots into the No7, and someone called Slade Griffin takes Cam Smith's No9. As bookmakers and Marge Simpson would say: Hmmm. Still, they're a decent side, Storm, and they'll travel to the Gold Coast to take on the Titans who are seven and six, and (somehow) fifth in our Telstra Premiership. How is it so? Dunno. But they've got some fair players. And a pretty good coach. And theirs is a top footy stadium. And now that Melbourne are missing their champions will have a pretty good sniff on the Goldie Monday night. Gamble really responsibly. Kamikaze Papali And so to the Big Dance on Wednesday night and many eyes on Origin debutants Nathan Merritt and Aaron Woods for the Blues, and Daly Cherry-Evans and Josh Papalii for the Maroons. Good luck to the new boys because they will need it. Suncorp Stadium will fairly heave. The best rugby league ground in the world can produce a cyclone of noise. It's compact and thick, and great. Will it make Merritt nervous? Will it affect Cherry-Evans's hands? Will it send Papalii on a kamikaze attack on Paul Gallen, to test the opposition captain's take on \"no fighting\"? We find out Wednesday. And as Al Pacino once said: Hoo-ha."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
